 DOCUMENT IS TliE PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT) .C R E T. 317 (S3).                                          COPY NO.                        CABINET.                        POST   OFFICE.   REPORT OF COMMITTEE  ON ENQUIRY ON THE  POSTOFFICE, 1952.   Joint Memorandum of  the Chancellor  of  the Exchequer and  the                       Postmaster General.          A copy of the Report will he found with this Memorandum.The Committee unanimously agreed that a change in the status ofthe Post Office to that of a Public Utility Company or statutory authority, either wholly or in part was undesirable and placed on record their opinion that on the whole the Post Office performedthe services for which it was responsible with remarkableefficiency,.          The Committee has made two main recommendations0  Thefirst in relation to internal administration and organisation ofthe Post Office and the other concerning the relationship of thePost Office with the Exchequer.          As regards Post Office organisation, the Committee were of the opinion that the principal defect was over-centralisationat Headquarters and that the Secretariat &quot;had come to assume a                                                      Governmentposition which had no parallel in the Secretariat of any  other /&quot;Department&quot;.   They recommend that a Board should he establishedpresided over by the Postmaster General and representative of thevarious functions involved in Post Office affairs, that thepolicy of the Post Office should be decided by the Board  and carried out all over the country by a re-organisation of  theStaff, detailed suggestions of which are contained in theReport.  They further state that the Postmaster General musthave the power of over-ruling the Board in any matter ofpolicy as the Minister responsible to Parliament,                               -1- : &apos;:.
                                                   11?          In justice to the present Secretariat, thePostmaster General desires to observe that almost everygrievance or decision, local or central, is liable to appeal or challenge in Parliament, that representations and rights of appeal to the Postmaster General himself have fromtime to time been conceded to the various Post Office Unionsrand above all that the Postmaster General is directly responsible to Parliament for his policy and decisions inrelation to probably the largest trading organisation inthe Country.           The Postmaster General further observes, that whatever merits there may be in criticisms of over-centralisation, the Secretariat is justly entitled when its policy and administration is the subject of review andappraisement, to receive full credit for the important - ifnot principal - part it has achieved in making the machine and securing the efficient public services to which theCommittee have themselves so generously testified.   Pewcomparable organisations today, he submits, had they beenthe subject of a rigorous examination, would have stoodthe test so well and obtained so favourable a verdict.          The appointment of such a Board and the de-centralisation and re-organisation suggested is of course,not without difficulties and dangers.   So far as thecreation of the Board is concerned the Committee themselves have indicated the position may be somewhat of an anomalousone i.e., that the Board will be responsible for policy but that the Postmaster General must have the power ofover-ruling the Board on policy.   Again, if therecommendations as to re-organisation and greater devolut-ion are adopted, a greater risk will undoubtedly have tobe taken by the Postmaster General responsible as he willbe still to Parliament.   There is also, of course, the
                                                  118danger of experimenting with a machine -which has  certainlyfunctioned very well in the main,  as the Committee hasitself testified constantly throughout their Report.   Andthe conception of a Board may need revision in the light of experience.            No doubt with judgment and goodwill a good manyof these difficulties can be overcome and there is much  tobe said for a trial being made on the lines indicated inthe Report.   We therefore recommend that the Committee&apos;proposal be adopted and that     the Postmaster General should, with the concurrence     of the Prime Minister, appoint a suitable Board on     the lines and with the duties suggested in the     Report, and that one of the first duties of the     Board be to take such action as may be necessary     and advisable to carry out the proposals generally     for re-organisation set forth in the Report.   It     being understood that, if the Postmaster General     finds on examination that any eliminations or     modifications in such scheme (including the Board     system itself) are desirable^ he shall make such     eliminations or modifications accordingly in con-     sultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.            The other main recommendation of the Committeerelates to the present financial relationship between theExchequer and the Post Office,   We recommend that thisproposal, which may involve legislation (either by aseparate Bill or a clause in the Finance Bill), be adoptedin principle, although further examination may suggest thedesirability of some modification In detail,    We proposethat this aspect of the matter, and the working out  of any consequential re-arrangements which may follow in relationto the Treasury and the Post Office, be remitted to  a small
       inter-departmental  Committee  under  the Chairmanship of       Sir  Ernest  Strohmenger,   This Committee  should also       advise  as to  the  date  from which  the  change shall take       effect.                  As  regards the relationship of the Post Office       to the  Office of  Vorks,  there are no  recommendations       varying the present general position  between the two       Departments,  and  we recommend that  any re-arrangements       that may from time  to  time be deemed  necessary shall be       the  subject of  discussion and adjustment  between the two       Departments as  hitherto,                  \7e  also recommend that  the Committee&apos;s con-       clusions concerning the  relationship  of the Post Office       and  the  Stationery  Office be  generally accepted,                  So  far  as  the Advisory  Council of the Post       Office  is concerned, the Postmaster General shall strengthen       the personnel of  the Council  and arrange  that it shall be       consulted on  matters of  general policy in which the public       are  interested  and  enable its members to  raise items for       discussion  on its Agenda as recommended in the Report,                  The Postmaster General  shall also re-examine       the  question  of telephone charges in  the light of the       suggestions contained  in the  Report.                  The Postmaster General  shall be authorised on       an appropriate  occasion to announce that the Government       accept in principle the two main recommendations in the      Report, and that it will be one of  the first duties of the       new Post Office Board to examine sympathetically the  re-       commendations as to re-organisation of a detailed character      which are therein contained,                                 (Intld. )  NoC.September,  1932(,

COMMITTEE  OF  ENQUIRY  ON  THE            POST  OFFICE,  1932.                        REPORT.The Right Hon. Sir Kingsley Wood, M.P., His  Majesty&apos;s                     Postmaster General.                         SECTION I.                        Introductoby.  1. The  functions performed by the  Post Office may  be dividedinto two  main categories: (A) Communications  Services,  (B)various State services which have little or no connexion with com-munications, but are undertaken by the Post  Office as being themost convenient piece of machinery available for the purpose.  The main functions under (A) include :        (1)  The  Postal Service, including the foreign mails and the    parcel post.       (2)  The  Telegraph Service, including the Anglo-Continental    services and wireless communications with ships at sea.       (3)  The  Telephone Service, inland and international.       Under this heading would perhaps  also properly  fall:        (4)  Facilities for the remittance of  money both within this    country and  abroad by means of  Mail and  Telegraph Money    Orders, Postal  Orders and the cash on delivery system.       (5)  The inspection of ships&apos; wireless installations and the    examination of wireless operators for the Postmaster General&apos;s    Certificate.  The functions under  (B) comprise:        (1)  The Post Office Savings Bank and the administration of    the Post Office Register of War Loans.       (2)  The issue, custody and repayment of National Savings    Certificates.       (3)  The payment of Old Age Pensions, Widows and Orphans    Pensions and Army and Navy Pensions.       (4)  The  sale  of  Health  and  Unemployment  Insurance    Stamps.       (5)  The sale and issue of local taxation licences, wireless    receiving licences and motor licences.The Postmaster  General has  also  certain powers and duties inrelation to the  British Broadcasting Corporation.   2. Not  only  is the Post Office, judged by the number of its em-ployees, which  total some 230,000,  probably  the largest trading
C^iinizafcion in the country,  but no other organization  is in suchcontinuous, varied  and intimate contact with  the daily lives ofthe public.  3.  It  is,  therefore,  of manifest  importance  not only that theservices rendered to the public by  the  Post Office should be botheffective and  reasonable as to charges,  but that a feeling of con-lidence in the Post  Office should exist in the public mind, and thatthis confidence should  continue unimpaired.  i.  It  would be idle  to deny  that in  recent years a considerablebody of criticism has been directed against the Post Office.  Muchof this criticism  is uninformed  and irresponsible, but much of it isoenuine and  thoughtful  criticism coming from authoritative anddisinterested  sources.  5.  This  criticism  may  be said  to have culminated,  after thepublication of articles  by the Et.  Hon.  the  Viscount Wolmer,  a former Assistant Postmaster General,  in the Memorial  signed bysome 320  Members of Parliament and addressed to  the  PrimeMinister in December, 1931, asking for the appointment of a Com-mittee to inquire into the status and organization of the  Post office with a view to effecting such changes  in its constitution as would tend to improve the efficiency of the services for which  it was re-sponsible.   The  views  expressed in this memorial were briefly  tothe effect that the Post Office was a large-scale commercial business,chiefly concerned with problems unconnected with party politics,for the  efficient  conduct  of  which  the  constitution of an ordinaryGovernment  Department,  sometimes   involving frequent changes of the Minister  at its  head,  was ill-designed.  It was alleged thatsound and  progressive  management was hampered by the  system under  which  all surpluses   pass  automatically  to the  Treasury,thereby preventing  the Post  Office from building up the necessaryreserves for more rapid development; and that  failure in efficiencyon the part of an institution of the magnitude and importance ofthe Post Office not only involved the waste of great sums of money,but  also reacted unfavourably  on  the  business equipment  of thecommunity, besides adversely  affecting the prospects of the staff.The  Memorialists were apparently divided in opinion as  to the bestinstrument for carrying out the Post Office services, some favouringthe   Public  Utility Corporation   type of  organization;   others,machinery  similar to that evolved  in recent years for the conductof essential national services on lines adapted to the requirementsof each individual case, such as the Port of London Authority, theElectricity  Commission, and the British Broadcasting Corporation.  6.  Shortly  after  this  memorial had been  submitted we were appointed by the Postmaster General as a Committee : to enquire and  report as to whether any  changes in the constitution,  status, or system of  organization of  the Post Office would be in the public  interest;   : . &apos;                                              )   15863                                                    A 3
  7. In the conduct  of  our enquiry we have held  25  meeting^)visited various branches of the Post Office and taken such evidence as appeared likely to assist us in our task.                         SECTION II.              Existing Constitution and  Status.  8. By the term  &quot; status &quot; as used in  our  terms of reference weunderstand is meant  the relationship  in which the Post  Officestands, through Parliament and  the machine of Government,  to thepeople of  this country; by the  term &quot;constitution &quot;  the concreteform in which such relationship is embodied.  9. The  present  constitution  and  status of the Post Office are,generally speaking, those of an ordinary Department of State.  TheDepartment is under  the charge of a  Minister, the  PostmasterGeneral, assisted by a Par-liamentary Under-Secretary.   The Post-master General is responsible  to Parliament,  and  is  subject  to parliamentary control  and interpellation  in precisely the same way as the Ministers in charge of other Departments.  The Post office is  subject  to  the   normal Treasury control  in  matters affectingexpenditure and staff.  10. Relationship to the Treasury. Prom  the financial aspect theposition of the Post Office as a revenue-producing Department is emphasised by  the fact  that revenue  and  expenditure are keptentirely separate, the former being paid over intact to the Exchequerand the latter being voted by Parliament on the annual Estimates,with the exception of capital expenditure on telephone and tele-graph  construction and on  Post Office sites and&apos; buildings.  Suchcapital  expenditure is financed by loans,  representing the esfci-mated expenditure for a period of  years, raised  by  the Treasuryfrom the National Debt Commissioners  and repaid through  annuities-ties which are charged upon the Post Office vote.  The loans out-standing as at 31st March, 1932, amount to some  95,000,000, andthe provision for annuity payments (covering interest  and amortisa-tion)   in  the estimates  of  the current year  amounts to some 9,645,000.  11. Inasmuch as the  Post Office  Estimates and  AppropriationAccount on the one hand,  and the  entries relating to Post Officebusiness in the National finance Accounts on the other, are merelystatements of cash expenditure and cash receipts by the Post Officeitself,  they give no true  picture of the financial results of PostOffice  operations for  the year.  No payment is  made to the PosiOffice  for services rendered to other Government Departments, suchas  the transmission of official correspondence, the management ofNational  Savings  Certificates,  and  the  payment of  Old Age  and war  Pensions.  Conversely, the  Post Office is not  debited withthe cost of certain services rendered to it  by other Government
departments, e.g., the maintenance of buildings and the provision of furniture by the Office of Works, and the provision of stationery and printing by the Stationery Office.  12.  Since the Post Office is in many respects a business concern, it has  also  been found  desirable  to  maintain   &quot; Commercial Accounts &quot;  as distinct  from, and in addition  to,  the  National Finance  Accounts.  These  Commercial Accounts which  are pub- lished annually, are framed on a model prepared with the  aid of an independent Chartered Accountant, and are audited by the Auditor- General.  Services rendered  to and by other Government Depart- ments  are  brought in, and  provision is made for  such  items  as interest on capital, depreciation of plant and pension liability.   13. Relationship to the  Office  of  Works and the  Stationery Office. As  regards its  relations  with  Government Departments other than the Treasury, the Post Office is concerned mainly with the Office  of Works  and  the  Stationery Office.  The  Office  of Works is responsible for the provision and  maintenance of Post Office sites  and buildings, Class I, that is,  all  freehold  buildings (except rural automatic exchanges) and the larger rented premises.   The Post  Office is required to have recourse to  the Stationery Office for all printing except stamp  and security printing.  The Stationery  Office can, in its  discretion, allot the work  to its  own Printing Works  without consultation with the Post Office.  We understand that in addition the transference  of postage stamp and security printing to Stationery Office  control on the expiry of ex- isting contracts, is under consideration, and we refer to this ques- tion later in our Report.                         SECTION III.              Criticisms of the Existing System.   14. We have felt that an  examination into the main features of the present  conduct of Post Office business, with a brief analysis of what  appear to us to be the causes of the  defects  alleged, is  an indispensable preliminary to  any  consideration of the question whether a change in the existing  status of the Post Office is desir- ahle or not.   We would wish to make it clear  that we have confined this examination  to those aspects which appear to us to come within our terms of reference; in other words, we have made it our object to discover, as far as possible, not so much  whether each compo- nent cog is operating effectively but rather whether the machine as a whole is of the design best suited to the purpose which it  serves.   15. It is of some interest to observe that the services of the Post Office which form the main subject of criticism are the Communica- tions Services, and in particular the Telephone Service.   We have heard no serious complaints regarding the conduct of the various services  unconnected  with Communications, and we158153A 4
believe that not only is the public well satisfied with the manner iftlwhich these services are performed, but that  they  are in fact pev-formed with a high degree of efficiency.  The  administration of the savings Bank Department and the Money Order Department, forinstance,  reflects great credit upon  those  responsible,  and  the economy and general absence of friction with which the payment ofpensions of various sorts is effected by the Post Offices throughoutthe country merit high approbation.  16. When we turn to the Communications Services, however, we find a difference.  The criticisms to which our attention  has  been drawn relate in many cases to matters which, though  individuallytrivial, are in the mass symptomatic of a general, if somewhat ill-defined, dissatisfaction.  These criticisms fall into  two classes: those specific to some particular service and those common to all services.  17. The Postal Service. Generally  speaking there is little  criti-criticism regarding  the  efficiency of the Postal Service as  such.  the criticisms that have reached us relate  mainly  to the desirability of restoring the penny  post and  of giving earlier and later deliveries inresidential suburbs and in  &quot; dormitory &quot; towns.  The restoration of penny postage is a matter which we feel fallsoutside our competence.  Improvements in the scale of deliveries, are almost entirely aquestion of cost involved in relation to the benefit  accorded.   we find little  evidence  of  any widespread and genuine desire on thepart of the public for the restoration of the somewhat lavish scale of postal  deliveries obtaining before the War, nor do we think thatit would be easy to  find any  general unanimity as  to the form any widespread increase in the scale should take; indeed it is possiblethat some existing  deliveries might on investigation be found to involve more expense  than is justified by their value.  We believethat the Post Office are fully alive  to  the necessity of  meeting the legitimate requirements of the public  in specific  cases,  so far as financial considerations permit.  18. It has been suggested to us that there has been a diminutionin the rate of sorting in comparison with that obtaining before theWar.   Comparisons of any value in this matter are difficult owingto the changes in equipment  and modifications of method that havetaken place.  Tests of individual rates are apt to be misleading,since in  practice sorting depends  upon team work,  and certain modifications appear to have improved the rate collectively, althoughreacting to some extent on individual output.   So far as we are ableto  ascertain, supervision is satisfactory and a good  general level of effort and output is maintained.  19. The Telegraph Service. This Service  formed the  subject ofexhaustive investigation by  the  Committee  presided  over by  Sir
 tardman  Lever in 1927.  The main criticism against the Tele-eraph Service has been that it is run at a heavy loss.   Little com-plaint has been received against the quality of the service, althoughoccasional instances of undue delay have been brought to our notice.  20.  Our enquiries show that steps have been taken to improve thefinancial  position of the Telegraph  Service  since the  date  of theLever Committee&apos;s  Eeport by the introduction and standardisation of Teleprinter apparatus, by readjustments in the apportionment totelegraphs of certain  common  service staff costs  and  by a closerscrutiny of the adjustment of staff to traffic.   Subsequent  to theI ,-ever  Committee  a departmental commission has  conducted an examination into the Telegraph  Service in  the United  States  ofAmerica, and  a considerable measure of reorganization  has been effected, particularly in the  direction of modifications of lay-out,elimination of unnecessary routes, etc.  The operating  standard onTeleprinter apparatus has been raised and a higher output is being obtained.    The deficit on the Telegraph Service which stood  atsome   1,380,000 in 1927-28 has been reduced to about  1,005,000in 1930-31, and to  828,000 (subject to audit) in 1931-32.  21.  From the evidence  before us, however, we  have little doubtthat  the  Telegraph  Service, as  such,  in this country is on thedecline, and should in due  course be merged with the telephone service.  It is  in  the unfortunate position  of lying between theupper and nether millstones of an expanding Telephone Service andof a  Postal  organization which, with relatively minor exceptions,insures the delivery, of a letter anywhere within the boundaries ofthe British Isles within 24 hours of posting.  No close comparisonwith   the  American  telegraph  system  is  therefore  possible.   Inthe United States a large part of the profit is derived from nightletter telegrams,  the  equivalent of  which can in  this country  besent by post at a cost of ljd.  22.  The rates are unremunerative and in particular, as pointedout by the Lever Committee, the existing Press Tariffs result in anannual loss, which  they estimated at the time of their Eeport  asamounting to about  200,000.  The Lever Committee recommended that the possibility of com-plete fusion of the Telegraph, Cable, Wireless and Telephone Ser-vices should be explored.  Onr own enquiries have led us also to theconclusion that the best prospects of improvement lie in  the direc-tion of the amalgamation of the Telegraph and Telephone Services.  23.  It is clear  that the trend  of  modern  development must  betowards the disappearance of the Telegraph  Service as a separateentity.  Progress in the technique of transmission and the fact thata considerable  proportion of telegrams  is already transmitted by telephone both  go to indicate that the distinction between oral andverbal transmission is artificial.   We are satisfied that,  although   15S63                                                   A 5
certain preliminary administrative difficulties may be involved, tf,,time  has now come when  the necessity  for this  fusion can beaccepted.  24. The general policy  of the Post Office should therefore befocussed in the  direction  of the complete  amalgamation  of  thaTelegraph with  the  Telephone Service.   We feel  that  the  bestefforts to reduce  the financial loss on the Telegraph Service by theintroduction of  improvements  in apparatus and in organizationwhile valuable in themselves, are of a purely palliative character.&apos;We find that  in  the technical departments this is well understood,and that much has already been accomplished towards the step werecommend.  25. The Telephone Service. It is undoubtedly  towards the Tele-phone Service that the main  mass of criticism is directed.  The critics  allege that:        (a) The charges are high.       (b) Telephone development  throughout the  country as a    whole is backward.      (c) The actual service is  indifferent.  26. Comparisons with other countries where different conditions and  different  habits obtain  are notoriously misleading.    For in-stance,  in the case  of  America with which comparison has  beenmade, line plant  is considerably cheaper than in Great Britain, theconstruction of underground  lines an expensive item is faciliated by the rectangular lay-out of towns and by long  and uniform roadsections  with abundant side space, and  reinstatement costs are lower.  Even discounting  such  factors, however,  we feel that thereis some  substance in the first two criticisms,  which are closely related  as cause  and effect.  The  existing charges are probablyaffected by the low calling rate  which, in  turn, is partly due to thelow telephone density; but it is difficult to see how the two latterfactors can be raised substantially  unless they are  given  the  pre-liminary impetus of a reduction in rates, even though this reductionmight cause initial losses in  some cases.   A low  telephone densityalso involves  a proportionately higher cost per  station in cablingand loss of revenue on expenditure in respect of idle wires.  The slow growth of the telephone habit in this country and the disposition to regard the use of this instrument  as a purely  utili-tarian adjunct,  rather than as an  amenity, of life, have a notunimportant effect upon telephone costs.   An examination of com-parable  statistics in London  and   New  York  shows that  afterbusiness  hours the  calling rate in  New  York is maintained  at afar higher level  than in  London,  thus facilitating a much  more economical use of the exchange plant  which in each case must beof a capacity  sufficient to handle the peak of the load.  27. Another factor contributing to  the high  cost of  telephone:in this country, which may be  mentioned, is the low output ol
 instructional  and  maintenance  staff  as  compared with  certain other countries.   We are glad, however, to find that as a resultof intensive  study of  engineering practice,  the  use of  costingmachinery and methods of  supervision, marked improvements  moutput and economy in regard to construction and maintenance arebeing obtained.  We understand  that the  steps  taken  in  thisdirection have  led to a reduction of between 30  per cent, and 40 percent, in  both construction and maintenance labour costs.   It should perhaps  be remarked that relatively low  output appears to be  a feature  of contractors&apos;, as well as  of  direct  Post  Office,  labour.Direct labour  employed by the Post Office only accounts, we areinformed,  for  one-fifth  of the capital  expenditure  on Post Officeconstruction work.  We  understand  that the  attention  paid  to training  by theAmerican  Telephone  and Telegraph Company has produced excel-leut results.  We would lay stress upon the importance of continuing systematicstaff training,  especially training lor the immediate supervision of personnel  employed upon construction and maintenance work.  28.  It appears probable that the general standard of constructionespecially  in thinly populated areas, is  higher  in this country  thanin others.   Aerial cables for instance are widely used in America.It is also  true to say that in countries that possess a, high degreeof telephone development the general attitude of the public, so faras we can ascertain,  is more encouraging to such development inrespect of  such matters  as wayleaves  and overhead cabling.  While we do not advocate slipshod methods of construction or theneglect  of reasonable precautions, we feel that it is for consideration whether the standard of construction is not perhaps  unnecessarilyhigh in  thinly  populated areas.  29.  As  regards  the   common   criticism  that  the  service   isindifferent, we would make the following observations :    The habit of condemning  the Telephone  Service began  when itwas in the hands of private enterprise, and still continues, probablywith diminishing force; but  in this country  habits die hard.   It isdifficult  to adopt  an unprejudiced attitude  regarding an instrumentwhich, if it is one of the blessings  of civilization, is not  altogetheran unmixed blessing.  The telephone subscriber is apt to  rememberthe occasions  on which  he has been badly served, while  forgettingthe innumerable occasions when he has had no cause for complaint.While we think that there is undoubtedly room for improvement,especially  in the provincial service, we believe that telephone sub-scribers  as a  body  will agree that  there  has been  a marked im-provement during the last two or three years.  We have heard reliable evidence to the  effect  that in certain  re-spects, notably the Toll Service and the rural service generally, theBritish  Telephone Service  compares  favourably with that of othercountries which are frequently held up  as  examples.
  30. The Telephone  Service is at the  moment  in  a state IPtransition from the manual to the automatic system  and we believ.that when this transition is completed, further improvement will be experienced.  31. It is not  perhaps generally  realised how remarkable thetechnical progress made  by the Post Office during the last 10 years has been.  Ten years  ago telephone communication with places abroad wasinefficient and was confined to Paris and Brussels and a few townsin their vicinity.  To-day, telephone communication by wire is main-tained with the  whole of Europe except Turkey and  Greece andextends as far as Ceuta,  in Morocco.  The development of &quot; radio-links &quot;  in telephony has added the  whole of the North  american continent as well as Australia,  New Zealand,  South Africa and egypt to the inter-communicating systems reached directly from theBritish Post Office system, and further developments are impending.It is now possible to communicate by telephone from Great britain with  more than 93 per  cent, of the telephone subscribers of theworld.  In the developments of technique which have led to this  result the  British  Post Office has played  a leading part, and  GreatBritain has become the switching centre through which Europe and america  communicate  with each  other and  with  the  british dominions.  No radio centres exist elsewhere comparable in mag-nitude  with  the Post  Office transmitting centre  at  Rugby and receiving  centre at Baldock.  The inland trunk system has since the war been practically trans-formed from an imperfectly  developed open wire  system to a fully developed  system in which  all  main  centres are  inter-connectedby  a stable  system of underground  cables equipped with  loadingcoils and  telephone repeaters.  In the development  of undergroundcable technique the Post Office  has, from the beginning,  led theway, and it is,  we understand, the only Administration which hasbeen able to connect its main  commercial  centres by  telephonecircuits which transmit  speech between the trunk  terminal pointswithout overall  loss  of  energy.  Inventions  by Post  Office  engi-neers, have  enabled circuits to  be used  simultaneously for tele-graph and telephone purposes without any reduction in the  number or  efficiency  of  the  speech  channels.   There  are  many  othertechnical  developments and devices for which the  Post  Officeengineers can claim credit and the  above examples are  only citedto remove any erroneous impression that may exist  that the BritishPost Office is backward or unprogressive on the technical side.  32.  Several  witnesses have  referred  to   the  indifferent  nightservice as compared with day service.   We understand that nightoperators are partly recruited from disabled ex-service men.  under such  conditions  efficiency  of  service  must  inevitably  be im-paired;  but  we think  that if this  fact  were known,  the effect
(Ivould be endured with patience by those who recognize the obliga- tions we owe to those who  suffered in the War.   The objections formerly made to the employment of women  up to 11 p.m.,  to supplement  the  operators recruited from ex-service men, seem  to us to have little weight at the present day.   We do not suggest that women should replace ex-service men, but they might take the place of other male operators who may be now employed at that time.   33.  We believe that  much of the dissatisfaction with the  tele- phone system is due to  the  general diffusion of responsibility and absence of co-ordination between those concerned with the various elements  involved  in  the  provision and  conduct of the  service. While the District Manager is, broadly speaking, responsible for the ielephone service in his  area he has no jurisdiction over engineer- iug and  little disciplinary control over the operating staff.   The general  pubhc imagine  that the  District Manager is responsible for all  questions affecting the  Telephone,  and are not unnaturally exasperated  when they find that there is no one authority who can deal with complaints,  or  ensure  that orders  are promptly and satisfactorily executed.   The District Manager is also handicapped by the  restriction of bis executive authority.  He is, or should be, in the best position to appreciate local  needs and  conditions,  and in  such matters  as publicity, canvassing, etc.,  rigid control by Headquarters on matters of detail and method tends  to repression of zeal and initiative, as well as to waste of time and money.   34.  General Criticisms  of the   Communications Services. We have heard many criticisms which, though perhaps trivial in them- selves are, in the aggregate, indicative of a need for improvement in certain directions.   The  rather generalized  charges that have been  made  are not readily susceptible of definition, but we think they could be formu- lated as follows :      There is said to be       (1) An absence of the spirit of public service, among certain     sections of  the staff an  attitude  of indifference instead of a     desire to help the public.       (2) A  lack   of  initiative   and  an  absence  of  elasticity     and  imagination in adjusting service to meet the reasonable     variations in the public demand; prompt action is thought to be     hampered by &quot; red tape &quot; and dilatory procedure.       (3) In  general   an  absence of  the  commercial  outlook     necessary for the efficient conduct of what is, at any rate to a     large extent, a business concern.       (4) A failure in  regard to  the Telephone and  Telegraph     Services  which are of  a highly technical  character, to give     proper  scope  to the engineer, whereby technical  progress  is     impeded.
  35. Turning to an examination of these criticisms,  we take firstwhat may be referred to broadly as Staff efficiency.  In so far as concerns the general attitude of those sections of thePost Office  staff who come into contact with the public, we believethat the charges of positive discourtesy made against the Post office staff are exaggerated.  Instances do, and must  almost inevitably,occur in so large a concern, but the fault is not invariably on the side of  the staff, nor can this failing  be said  to  be  unknown in commercial organizations  or in Public  Utility undertakings.  Asregards the Telephone Service independent evidence tended to show-that, in general,  the quality of the staff is excellent.  36. But,  it has been contended, the general standard of efficiency of the staff is inevitably lowered by the fact that they work underCivil  Service conditions which  are  assumed to  involve absence ofincentive and the opportunity for rewarding individual merit.  Theseconditions are said also to  involve relative immunity from dismissal of  any  but the grossly  inefficient,  and  restricted  and  retardedopportunities of promotion; consequently, that it would be easier todevelop staff efficiency under the more flexible and less stereotypedsystem of ordinary commercial  practice, where  inefficiency can bemore effectively penalised, and ability and initiative more easily andpromptly rewarded.  37. Another school of thought holds that the best  work is not done under the constant fear of summary dismissal, and that pro-motion by selection may lend itself to favouritism and  is, moreover,inapplicable where, as in  the  case  of sorting, efficiency is largely dependent  upon team work and cannot be  measured by individualoutput.  38. We believe that both these views contain elements of truth.  While it might be argued  that  a  greater degree  of flexibilitymight be obtained if the  Post  Office staff were  removed from theconditions  of Civil Service employment as ordinarily understood, itmust be remembered that  many of the staff difficulties indicated arenot peculiar to Government employment, but obtain  in nearly alllarge scale  organizations where, by the very nature of the  work,  alarge number of routine workers is required relatively to  a smallsupervisory and controlling staff.  39. The fundamental difficulty in the problem of large scale staffefficiency is not the formulation of abstract principles but  theirpractical application.  We believe  that the main  obstacle  to  the  application  of theprinciples which should govern the control of staff  lies not so muchin the fact  of State employment, as in the method of handling theproblem by the Post Office under the existing system.  40. We consider that there is far too much centralization of staffmanagement  at  Headquarters  and  too little freedom  left to thelocal officer in the province;?, who is responsible for the direct con-
^ol of the  staff  employed under him.   The function of Head-quarters  in  a  Department such as the Post Office and  this is amatter to which we shall revert later should be, in regard to staff as well as to  other aspects of administration, to formulate policyand secure its observance; the practical application of such policy should be left  as far as possible to the local executive official.   As a corollary, however, the  local official  must feel  that, provided  heobserves  the general principles of  policy prescribed, he will receivethe support of his superiors, and  must cease to regard the presentrights of appeal by the staff to Headquarters, which seem unneces-sarily extensive, as in any way reducing his own responsibility and initiative.  41. It  has been suggested to us that in the higher grades it isimpossible under Civil Service conditions, to pay salaries  sufficientto attract and retain the best men, especially on the technical side.We can  find no evidence to suggest that in this respect  the PostOffice  staff  compares on  the  whole  unfavourably in ability and efficiency with that  of  comparable outside commercial  concerns;indeed we consider the reverse to  be the case.  42. It  has also been suggested to us that assuming the  retentionof the Post Office under  State control,  certain sections, such  asmanipulative and technical staff might be removed from Civil Ser-vice  conditions and  placed  under the more elastic  conditions of ordinary  commercial  concerns.  43. We have had no evidence which would justify us in endorsingeither of these suggestions and we are satisfied that so long as thePost Office remains under State control the conditions of the staffmust be  governed by the same general principles as are applied tothe staff  of  other Departments.   In this connexion it must be  re-membered that the payment of special salaries for posts  requiringspecial qualifications  is at present possible with Treasury consent.  44.  As regards the other heads of criticism summarised in Para. 34and relating to what may be briefly termed absence of initiative andimagination, resulting largely from over-centralised control, lack ofthe commercial attitude, and the inadequate status of the  engineer,we propose  to deal with these together as essentially part of thesame problem.  45.  While, in our opinion, these criticisms are not devoid of somesubstance, we  have  formed the  impression that  in general  thestandard  of  efficiency  shown by the Post Office in  the performance of its duties is very  satisfactory.    We doubt whether the publicfully appreciates how  high this standard is.   Criticism is easy andcomplaint is generally more vocal  than appreciation. . We certainlybelieve that there is room for improvement, but, in our opinion, suchimprovement can only come from  a removal of certain fundamentalimpediments  to   efficiency;  tinkering with the  minor  detailsof administration will achieve little of permanent value.
                         SECTION IV.                       i               Causes of the Existing Defects.  46. The present organization of the Post Office will be dealt within fuller detail in later&quot; paragraphs.  At this  point we shall concernourselves only with those root  causes which, in our opinion, areresponsible  for such  defects  as  exist, endeavouring at the sametime  to  furnish  the  reasons  which have prompted  us to regard as  impracticable  certain   radical   reforms   suggested   to  us.It may  be apposite  here  to say  that  several  witnesses, whoseopinions carry considerable weight with us, while  differing as tothe solution of  the  problem, were very largely in fundamentalagreement as to  the  nature of these causes  which give rise to the defects  mentioned  and militate  against  a higher standard in theconduct  of Post  Office Communications Services.  The causes may  be described  as :        (1)  The relationship in which the Post  Office stands, as a    Revenue Department, to the Exchequer.       (2) The internal organization of the Post Office  which is to    some extent  conditioned by (1).  47. It  has  been  further contended  that  over-centralizationinevitably results from Parliamentary intervention in regard to theday to day  working of the machine.   It has  been argued that solong as the Postmaster General is liable to be questioned and cross-examined in the  House of Commons on  every petty detail of dailyadministration,  so  long  will the  devolution  of responsibility  be hampered, since  every official feels that his actions may form thesubject  of  Parliamentary interpellation,  and that he himself maybe called upon to justify his actions months, and even years, after-wards.   In addition, the liability to  Parliamentary  questioningentails  the  maintenance  of elaborate records and  breeds in theindividual  a  tendency  to  require  documentary  justification  orauthority for every  action taken.  48. It has been represented from many quarters that this positionwould, and can only be, remedied by sweeping changes in the status of the Post Office and the transfer of the control and administrationof its Communications Services, either in whole or in  part, to anindependent authority of the Public Utility Company or  StatutoryCorporation type.  49. We  have  examined  the  arguments in favour of  the totaltransference to a body of  this  character of all Post Office  Com-munications Services-Mails, Telephones and Telegraphs and weare definitely of opinion that such transference is impracticable, nor do we believe it  to be either necessary or desirable.  We considerthat the public have  a right  to the influence  which parliamentary discussion and control alone can give.
  In times of emergency there are obvious reasons why the G-overn-ment should control the postal services and we believe that there isno other country in Europe where the Mail Service is not controlled by the Government.  50.  We have also considered the question of the transference  of electrical Communications to  an  independent authority,  while leaving the Hails as a State Service.  Were  the problem with  which  we  are  concerned  that  ofinaugurating for  the  first  time in this country a new system  of communications, we think that there might be advantages in havingthe Telephone and Telegraph Services conducted by an independentAdministration divorced from direct Government control;  but suchis uot the case.  We are confronted with the position as it existsio-day where the Postal, Telephone and Telegraph  Services in thenatural course  of development have become closely interlocked  inthe organization.   51. Separation presents formidable practical difficulties in regardIO Buildings, Staff and Plant.  The Telegraphs and  Telephones areat present worked to a large  extent in the same buildings and  bythe same staff  as the Mails  Services.   The difficulty  in respect of buildings might admittedly be overcome  by a system  of leasing,although the joint  occupation  throughout  the country of  premiseswhich are incapable of internal  separation, by two distinct staffsresponsible to two separate Administrations, and under different con-ditions  of  service, would  involve interminable friction.  under present  conditions, in all but the largest Offices, the  counter staffnow deal indiscriminately with all natures of business, and in  allthe smaller  towns the sorting and  telegraph  operating  staff  arecombined, the  &quot; peak &quot; hours of postal work being usually outsidethose of  telegraph business.   No man  can serve two  masters, andthe appointment of separate  staffs would entail large  additionalexpense  and would result in two separate  organizations, neither ofwhich would be carrying a full load.   52. The  separation of Telephones from  Mails and Telegraphs isalso open to  grave objections.  Plant is largely identical and inter-changeable.  Telegraph and telephone wires are run  on  the samepoles and in the same cables, and, by the practice of superimposing,i he same wires are used simultaneously for both telegraphic andtelephonic  transmission.  These factors involve a  common  main-tenance and construction staff.  Moreover, as we have  stated above,we believe that the policy should  be to merge the  Telephone and telegraph Services.   The transference of both the Telegraph  and  Telephone services to an independent Corporation is  also complicated by the financialposition of the former service.
  An independent Corporation conducting both Telegraph and Tele-phone services would, as far as the former service was concerned,be compelled either to :        (a) raise money from the public for the maintenance of a    non-productive service which is steadily declining, or       (b) depend  upon  a  Government  subsidy  which  would    seriously  prejudice its &quot; independent &quot; character.  53. We do not therefore recommend the transference to an inde-pendent Corporation of either the Telephone and Telegraph Services,or the Telephone Service by itself.  54. Even  assuming  that  the   total   or partial  transference of the Communications  Services  to  an  independent  corporation were  feasible,  we   are  by   no   means  satisfied   that   themanagement  of  the  Services in   question  by  such  a  body would infallibly result in the disappearance of the defects to whichwe have  alluded, while it might be withdrawn too much from thewholesome  operation  of  public   criticism.   Over-centralization.absence of initiative,  lack of imagination  and failure to give appro-priate representations to technical functions are faults which areto be found  in  the  sphere  of private  as well as Government,administration.  We also feel impelled  to observe that those sections of  the publicwhich are most insistent upon the  Communications Services of thePost  Office being conducted on the lines  of commercial enterprise,are  not  infrequently  those  most  prone  to  demand  services  and facilities which cannot possibly pay their way. We fear that in-dependent management  would seek to develop  the more  remunera-tive  business  of the denser areas to  the detriment of more  remoteand  sparsely  populated  districts.   55.  Tt cannot  be denied that Parliamentary intervention in the minor details of  daily administration may be harassing  and some-times vexatious;  it indubitably involves in many instances an expen-diture of time and effort quite disproportionate to the  importanceof the matter in  question.   At the same time, we are inclined tothink that this insistence on the supposed results of Parliamentaryintervention in matters  of detail is somewhat  unduly stressed andthat in the long run, the advantages of the power of Parliamentaryintervention  outweigh  its  disadvantages.   It seems  to us that where complaints are expressed  against  a business  so closely in contact  with the everyday lives of the public as the Post  Office,some means of ventilation is necessary, and on the whole we believethat  the House of Commons provides the best machinery for thispurpose.   In effect, we do not consider the relationship in which thePost Office stands to Parliament is a factor which essentially and inevitably makes the efficient performance of its duties impossible,
or that the position of  the Post  Office in this respect differs sub-stantially  from  other  Government  Departments   subject  to parliamentary control.  56. We do, however, consider that the main causes of such defectsas may exist, are the two described in paragraph 46, viz., the rela-tiouship between the Post Office and the Exchequer, and the internalorganization of the Department,  and we  believe that  the faults towhich attention  has been drawn,  can  be  eradicated by  certain modifications of financial status and by changes in organization atleast  as effectively  as by the revolutionary  step  of removing thePost  Office  Communications  Services  from  direct  government control.  57. As we have indicated,  we  have formed the opinion that oneof the main obstacles to the more effective performance of the PostOffice is  the absence of what may  be  termed  &apos;&apos; self-contained&apos;&apos;finance.  So long as the existing financial arrangements continue,so long will the tendency to regard the Post Office as a revenue-producing instrument obscure  and  impede  its primary function,which is  the   service of the  public.  By  self-contained  financewe mean briefly a system under which the Post Office,  after makinga certain agreed  annual contribution  to  the Exchequer would beallowed to use  its surpluses, after  making the necessary reserves,for the benefit  of the public, the improvement of services and thedevelopment  of  its  business.    Self-contained  finance   wouldenable the management of the  Post Office to concentrate upon theservice of its public  instead of  being faced with dual and  oftenconflicting objectives.  58. We believe that  one of  the  most  important  effects  of sub-stituting  a system of self-contained finance  on  the  lines indicatedlater, will be to give to  the Post Office  administration a healthieroutlook and a  more  definite  objective.   The knowledge that  in-creased profits will  be absorbed in their entirety by  the Exchequercannot fail to  have a detrimental  effect  upon enterprise  and toencourage, to  some  degree, inertia  in the place  of activity.  Webelieve that  energetic direction can  only  be  ensured by the know-ledge among those responsible,  that such direction will promote thebenefit and advantage of the service for which they work.   If thePost Office were placed in the position that after making a definitecontribution to the Exchequer, its surpluses were at its own disposal,to be employed for  the  advantage  of its customers, the public, aradically  different outlook would, we believe, be created.  Similarly, we hold the view that  a powerful stimulus to directiveeffort would be given by the knowledge that  the Post  Office had tosafeguard the Exchequer contribution  while at the same time satis-fying its customers that it was giving proper attention and a reason-able  return for  their money.  In these circumstances the judgment
of proposals by commercial standards and the scrutiny of perform-ance by the same standards would, in our opinion, be enforced uponthe Administration.   Equally, with a  better realization that  thePost Office is a commercial organization, we feel that the public will come to learn that it cannot demand luxuries at the same price which it pays for necessities.  59. Furthermore, we consider that a reasonable measure of finan-cial autonomy such as we recommend, should facilitate some relaxation-tion of the Treasury control over matters of necessary administrativeexpenditure, which almost inevitably  obtains  under the  existing system, although we have no reason to assume that what may be termed  the  ordinary departmental Treasury  control is  undulyvexatious; the weight  of evidence being, in  fact,  rather to  thecontrary.  But,  in the existing circumstances,  there  are matters  requiringreference to the Treasury which  we feel might be left to the  dis-cretion of the Post Office.   In some cases the obtaining of treasury approval is very largely formal and relates to matters on which theTreasury are not  in a  position  to exercise  much  more  than  anacademic criticism.  Such  reference of  necessity involves clericalwork, correspondence, delays, etc. which under a more autonomoussystem of finance might, we anticipate, be substantially reduced.  60. An  example which tends to confirm our  opinion regardingthe advantages  of self-contained  finance is provided by the  PostOffice  Savings Bank.   This  sub-department of the  Post Office,through the existence of a separate fund, possesses a limited measureof financial autonomy at present denied to the Post Office itself.  Itis also very largely in the position of a commercial  business, since it is in  open competition  with  outside bodies for  attracting theinvesting public.   This latter fact has compelled the Savings BankDepartment to develop  a very  high degree of  enterprise in opera-cion.   Indeed we do not think it is going too far to say that the savings  Bank is ahead  of  any comparable private  concern in theadoption  and development  of office mechanization and labour  sav-ing devices.   61. We consider,  therefore,  that the main modification in thestatus  of the Post Office which is required is  in respect of its re-lationship to the Exchequer.                          SECTION V.   Suggested Modifications in  the Financial Status  of the                          Post Office.   62. The existing financial relation of  the  Post Office  with theExchequer has, in general terms, been described in paragraphs 10-11.It  rests, as is required by the  National financial  system,  on a strictly cash account  basis.  The Post Office pays over weekly to theExchequer its gross  revenue receipts which thereupon become  part
If the National revenue; it draws weekly from the Exchequer theamount  required to meet its  current  cash  disbursements so far as these  are  provided  for  in the  Post Office Vote.  The  surplus of receipts  by the Exchequer over issues from the Exchequer appears in the Budget and in the National Finance Accounts as the &quot; PostOffice Net Receipt &quot;.  63.  The balance  of these cash  transactions  does  not, taken by itself, represent the profit in a commercial sense earned by the PostOffice.   For instance, in determining the commercial profit or loss itis necessary to take account  of the accruing actuarial liability fornensions of  the existing personnel, whereas what enters into the cash transactions  is the pensions now paid to  the personnel of an earlier period. Thus it has happened that, until recently,the pensionliability  accruing annually has been a greater sum than the annualpension  payments, while at the moment, the current  pension pay-ments exceed the actuarial liability;  in effect the  Post Office isdrawing for its current  pensions on the theoretical accumulation of previous years.  Similarly the cash transactions  do  not show revenueearned but not actually received  within the year, or  liabilities in-curred but not actually discharged within the year,  nor do they include depreciation or obsolescence; whilst, on the other hand, the cash payments do include the amortisation of Loans.    Again, animportant part of the requirements of the Post Office  in respect of buildings, furniture, stationery, rates on premises, etc.  is paid for not  out  of the Post Office Vote  but  out of the Votes for Works,Stationery and Rate contributions; while, on the  other  side  of the account, the Post Office Vote includes expenditure of various kindson behalf of other departments for which it does not  receive re-payment.  6-1.  Tn our view modification of these arrangements in materialparticulars is  desirable, if  the Post Office is  to be regarded, and managed, as a self-supporting organization.  We are of opinion that in place of  the present &quot; Post Office NetReceipt  &quot; the Exchequer should receive a definite  contribution (theamount  and  character of which we discuss in the following para-graph),  and that the  residue should  be made available for  theimprovement and development of Post Office facilities and services to the public.  65. Tn determining the basis of assessment, and amount, of thatcontribution  we have first to deal with certain classes  of revenue and expenditure already mentioned.   These are :       (a) Work  done  for  the Post  Office by other  Government    Departments but not  paid for.      (b) Unpaid services rendered  by  the Post Office to  other    Government  Departments.      (c) The net receipts from  Wireless Receiving Licences  after    meeting the  cost of collection and management  and the pro-    portion payable to the British Broadcasting Corporation.
    &quot; Post Office Net Receipt &quot; ...             11,212,000Add (3) for work done by Post Office  for other Departments ...     ...               2,785,00013,997,000Less  (4)  for  work done for  Post  Office by other Departments  ...  1,595,000    (5) Net receipts from Wireless       Licences   .........    884,000                                   -    2,479,000                                               11,518,000Add (6) Excess of pension payments  over pension liability  ...     ...                778,000Net surplus 12,296.000      (rf) The excess (or  short fall) of actual  pension  payments&apos;    over the accruing actuarial liability for pensions of the existing    personnel.  66.  We are  of opinion as regards these four items       (a)  That  for  reasons  of  administrative  and   business    efficiency  the Post  Office should  pay for services rendered    to it by other departments, such as  the  provision and main-    tenance of buildings, the supply of printing and stationery, and    rates on Post Office buildings.      (b) That, similarly,  for services rendered by the Post Office    to other departments payment should be made.      (c)  That the Exchequer, and not the Post Office,  should be    entitled as at  present  to the  net  receipts from Wireless    Receiving  Licences.      (d) That the burden of cash pension payments in excess of    the actuarial liability  in respect of current personnel  should    fall on the Exchequer, and not  on the Post  Office  customer,    seeing that the Exchequer (in other words the taxpayer) must    be  presumed to  have received  in  past  years an appropriate    actuarial contribution for the cash liabilities which now fall to    be met.  67.  The effect on  the  accounts  if these  adjustments were made would be as follows : we use the latest figures  given to  us  by the comptroller and Accountant General of  the Post Office for the year1932-33 which must only be  taken as estimates  :                                                              (1)  Eevenue collected by Post Office  ...              70,400,000      Less (2) Post Office Vote payments         (on present basis)      ...     ...              59,188,000
I fig. In the present state of the  National  finances it would  be impracticable to suggest any other principle than that the exchequer should retain out of  the net revenue collected by the Post Office asum approximating to  the amount which it is at present receiving,subject  only to any  variation in  the  amount of items  3, 5 and 6 in para. 67 above, which for the reasons stated ought, in our view,to affect the Exchequer and not the Post Office customer :  on theother hand the Exchequer net receipt ought not to be diminishedor increased  by any variation in the expenditure on  work  doneby  other  Departments for  the  Post Office.  In  the last threeyears  the  figures  corresponding  to  the   12,296,000   above mentioned  have  been   10,654,000  in  1929-30,    10,754,000in 1930-31, and  12,303,000 in 1931-32.   The large increase in thelast named year is more than accounted for by the drop in the cost ofliving bonus.  On these figures and on the basis of the foregoing adjustments,a fixed contribution of   11,500,000 plus 50 per cent, of any excess over that  figure,  would,  in our opinion,  be an  appropriate  sum.Any marked alteration in the present level of  wages  or  in thepostage rates of inland letters would obviously necessitate recon-sideration of the contribution.  69. In recommending  that  the  Exchequer should share to theextent of  50 per cent, in any excess over  11,500,000, we  havehad in mind the fact that the growth  in the pension payments overpension liability (which we understand may  go  on for  some time)will  operate adversely  to the Exchequer, and whilst in principlewe think this  burden should fall on  the  Exchequer (see para.66 (d) ), we feel that it may be inexpedient,  for the time being, inview of the state of the National finance,  to put this charge on theExchequer unless they receive as a set off a share in the growth ofthe net receipts for a limited period.  If it should be decided that the principle  of inter-departmentalpayment for services rendered or other liabilities incurred shall notbe applied to the  extent which  we recommend,  then,  in order toarrive at  the cash contribution  payable to the Exchequer out ofthe net receipts actually held by the Post  Office, the basic contribu-tion of  11,500,000 would be subject to  adjustment each  year inrespect of the special items 3 and 4 mentioned above in para.  67 aswell as in respect of items 5 and 6.  We suggest that the amount  of the  contributions should be re-viewed  after three years.   70. The annual . accounts  prepared on a  commercial  basis  are designed to show the commercial profit or loss as between the PostOffice and its  customers and therefore show somewhat differentresults.  The commercial method seems to us to be a more correctprinciple for an arrangement  with  the Treasury than a cash basis,but in the absence of  a separate fund for the business of the PostOffice, outside  the Exchequer,  the principle is  difficult  to apply.
We think, however, that this matter should be further considered when the review of the amount of the contribution takes place after three years experience.  71. A  contribution, of  this kind  is  intended to cover various matters in regard to which it  seems to us proper that  the PoseOffice customer should make payments,  such as interest on capitalexpenditure provided by the Exchequer in  past years in  excess of outstanding loans, Income Tax under  Schedule A,  the servicesof the National Debt Commissioners with regard to the provision ofcapital,  and consideration  in  the  nature of  a  royalty for the monopoly conferred  by  Parliament on the Post Office in  regard toits principal classes of business.  72. The annual surplus  after  settlement with  the exchequer should be carried to a separate fund outside  the  Exchequer and made available for the  purposes already indicated.   The approvalof the Government of the day,  or at any rate  of the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, should be  required as  to  the specific applicationof the fund from time to time.  Pending its application it could be invested  temporarily with the National Debt  Commissioners, butwe wish  to make it plain that in our view it should be a Post Officefund and not a Treasury fund.  73. As regards  the provision  of capital required for Post office development, principally in connection with the Telephone system,we are of opinion that it is  neither necessary nor desirable that thePostmaster  General should possess  an unrestricted power  of bor-rowing, whether in  the market or otherwise.  Indeed no materialmodification  of the  present arrangements, under which  the PostOffice borrows from the National Debt Commissioners within limitssanctioned by Parliament and  the Treasury,&quot;appears to us to benecessary, so  long  as  the Treasury  are  prepared  to  meet, asthey  have  done in  the  past,  the  legitimate  and reasonabledemands  of the Post Office in  this respect.  If as a result of in-creased demand, stimulated by a more active commercial policy,the future capital requirements of the Telephone Service are sub-stantially increased, we feel sure that the Treasury  will, as theyundoubtedly  should, facilitate the provision of the necessary fundsthrough the National Debt  Commissioners.                         SECTION VI.Relations with other Government Departments.   Ministerial              Status of the Postmaster General.                        Office  of Works.  74. As has been stated earlier in our Report, the responsibility forthe provision, as  well  as the maintenance, of freehold  buildings(except rural automatic exchanges) and  the larger rented premisesrequired  by the Post Office  rests with the Office of Works.
* The expenditure involved is met either out of capital or revenue,as the case demands,  and the Post Office is debited with such ex-penditure incurred on the provision of these sites and buildings asfalls on capital account.  75. It has been  suggested to us by some witnesses that relianceupon the Office of Works for the Works Services in question involvesextravagance  and delay,  and that the Post Office should  have itsown Works and  Architects Department and be independent of theOffice of Works.  We find  ourselves unable  to support this view.  The Office ofWorks  staff have long and varied experience  of Post Office  work,which,  in regard to new buildings, represents more than  half thecurrent expenditure of the Office  of Works, and are well equipped to appreciate  and to deal with the functional  requirements of PostOffice buildings.  We  understand that close  touch is  maintained between the Post Office and the Office of Works.  While there maybe occasional instances to the contrary, we consider that  the cen-tralization of  this work in the Office of Works makes for economy and efficiency.  76. As regards choice of sites, there is an  intimate relationship between site  and building, and it  is necessary that the architectshould have an early  say  in this  matter.  The final decision as tosite should and, we understand, does, rest with the Post Office.  77. We consider that  the Office  of  Works should continue tobe responsible for  maintenance  and for the supply  of fuel  andfurniture; this arrangement makes for economy of staff and facili-tates the placing of large standardised contracts.  78. The Post  Office  and the Office of Works should work  in the closest  collaboration.   Any small variations in the demarcation oftheir respective  spheres of responsibility which may from time totime appear  desirable, should, with good will  on both sides, besusceptible  of Departmental  adjustment.  79. As stated  above, however,  we  consider that, under the  new financial arrangement  advocated,  the Post Office should pay for theservices rendered by the Office of Works.   The Post Office  shouldbe fully consulted by the Office of Works on matters relating to cost.                        Stationery Office.  80. The printing work at present performed for the Post Office by the Stationery Office falls into the following categories :        (1) Printing of the ordinary departmental matter common    to all Government Departments.       (2) Directory printing, such  as  the  Telephone Directory,    special to the Post Office.  We have been informed that it is proposed in accordance  with  a Treasury Minute on the Second Eeport of the Select Committee of Public  Accounts,  1929,  that the  responsibility  for  all security
printing, including the printing of stamps, should  be transferredto the Stationery Office as soon as  the  existing contracts  expire.This class of printing comprises :        (a) The printing and supply of paper for stamps, stamped    stationery,  postal orders  and  postal drafts, required  by the    Post Office itself.       (b) The printing arnd  supply of paper  for  pension  forms,    insurance stamps, etc., required for  services conducted by the    Post Office on behalf of other Government Departments.  81. As regards the ordinary departmental printing coming undercategory (1) above, we consider that the existing arrangements forthe performance of the work should continue.  As regards Directory printing we understand that the stationery office  have installed large  and expensive plant specially designed for the printing of  the Telephone Directory.  We think, therefore,that in these  circumstances  this  work  must  continue  with the stationery Office, but as the financial scheme we  recommend is designed to place the Post Office as nearly as possible on  a com-mercial basis, we  consider that the Post  Office should have freeaccess  to the Stationery Office  accounts, and in the event of theirquestioning the propriety of the charges made to the Post Office forthis work, they should, failing agreement, have  the right to refer the matter under dispute to the decision of the Treasury.  82. As regards the printing of pension forms, etc., required bythe Post Office for work done on behalf of other Departments, we see no objection to its transfer to the Stationery Office.  The posi-tion in regard to the printing  of stamps and  postal orders, how-ever, appears to us to be on an entirely different footing.   Stampsare the main Post  Office instrument of revenue collection and theultimate responsibility for this instrument, in regard to security,design, delivery, cost, etc.,  must rest with the Postmaster-General.  We  feel that the only logical arrangement is  that the Post office should, in obtaining its supplies of  stamps, stamped stationery,postal  orders and drafts, call for competitive tenders and place their orders  in the best market.   The Stationery Office should, of course,be allowed to tender in competition with outside  firms.            Ministerial Status of Postmaster-General.  83. It has been represented to us by several witnesses that theappointment of Postmaster-General is regarded merely as a steppingstone in a political  career, and that this fact, apart  from the ordin-ary vicissitudes of party politics, leads to constant changes of Posfc-master-General and to abbreviated periods of tenure.  In such circumstances, it is argued, Ministers who do not remainlong enough to familiarise themselves with the work, not only tendto be unduly dominated by the influence of their permanent officials,but also find it difficult to undertake and carry through any import-ant developments of administrative policy.
^ It has been suggested that the status of the appointment should be so improved, either by including the holder in the Cabinet or by increasing the emoluments of the office, as to encourage the same Minister to continue his tenure throughout the life of the Govern- ment of the day.   84. We must confess that we are not greatly impressed by these contentions.   After all, it does not rest with the Minister himself to decide how long he should remain in his Office, and while  we agree that frequent and avoidable changes of Postmaster-General are to be deprecated, the  fact remains that other Departments possessing administrative problems at least as complicated  and specialised are subjected also to Ministerial changes without apparently any adverse effect, and we doubt whether, in fact, the disadvantages imputed to changes of Postmaster-General are substantially  due to this cause.                         SECTION VII.               Existing System of Oeganization.                          Headquarters.   85. The structure of the Post  Office organization is based upon the Secretariat.  The Secretary to the Post Office is the permanent bead of the Department and the principal adviser of the Postmaster- General.   Under the Secretary and his deputy, the Second Secre- tary, there are two Directors, the Director of Postal  Services  and the Director of Telegraphs and Telephones, who control respectively the work connected with Mails on the one hand and Telegraphs  and Telephones on  the other, assisted by  semi-technical inspectorial sections, termed Traffic sections.   The work is  sub-divided  into eight branches each under an Assistant  Secretary, dealing respec- tively  with Mails, Inland  Telegraphs, Overseas Telegraphs, Tele- phones, Buildings, Establishments, Staff and Chief Clerks duties, the last four branches being under  the direct charge of the Second Secretary.  These  branches, with the addition of the Investigation branch and the  Publicity  section,  constitute  the  Secretariat and, under the Postmaster-General, the Secretariat  is the fount of all authority.   86. Parallel with the Secretariat branches, but  subject to their general authority,  are seven Headquarter departments, the depart- ments of  the  Comptroller and  Accountant  General  (who is  the Accounting Officer of the  Post Office Vote and  Comptroller of the Post Office  Revenue), the  Controller  of  Stores  (who is  also responsible for Post Office Contracts, other than  those for manu- faeture and erection in situ,  and for the control of the Post Office factories in London and Birmingham), the Engineer-in-Chief, the Controller of the Savings Bank, the Controller of the Money Order Department and finally the Solicitor to the Post Office and  the Chief Medical Officer.
            Metropolitan and Provincial  Organization.           I)  87. Outside Headquarters there are two systems of organizationthe metropolitan and the provincial.  In London, the three Com-munications Services are organized  separately by services, under aController of the London Postal Service, a Controller of the LondonTelephone Service and a Controller  of the Central Telegraph Officerespectively.  In the provinces, geographical  areas and not servicesconstitute the basis of administration.  88. Outside Inner London, the country, excluding Edinburgh, is divided into 22  Districts for Post Office purposes ; of these, 13 are under the charge of Surveyors and 9, comprising nine of the largesttowns  and the immediately surrounding area, are under the chargeof Postmaster Surveyors.  In Scotland  the Post Office organization  is  under the generalcharge of the Secretary  in Edinburgh who in turn is responsible tothe  Secretary of the Post Office.  There is a Controller  in chargeof the Postal and Telegraph Services in Edinburgh  and a  smallsurrounding area.  89. The Surveyor or the Postmaster Surveyor is the PostmasterGeneral&apos;s chief provincial representative and is responsible for allthe Post Office  Services within  his District Postal, Telegraph and telephone although he has  no authority over the SuperintendingEngineer.   He has certain powers delegated to him within whichhe can act  upon his own authority.  For instance, the number ofletter deliveries and collections are prescribed by  Headquarters for large cities, medium  sized towns and  rural  areas, but  the  times and  other arrangements for  these  services  are prescribed by  theSurveyors  and  Postmasters according to local requirements.  A Surveyor  has  a certain measure  of  disciplinary  power,  but cannot dismiss  or  degrade  established staff who have passed theirprobation.  He has power to make promotions from the  manipula-tive to the first supervising grade.  He can engage temporary staff for periods of pressure,  and  add to the permanent staff,  subject inthe  latter  case  to  subsequent  statistical  justification  to  theAccountant General.  Any matter which requires  authority beyond the powers  delegated.is referred  to the  Secretariat of the Post Office.   Each  Surveyor has under  his control some 30 to 40 Head PostOffice  districts.   To  assist in the supervision and inspection of this area, he has a staff of Assistant Surveyors, First and Second  Class,an Assistant Traffic Superintendent for telegraph work, and an officestaffed by the  usual Civil  Service  clerical grades.   90.  For the telephone work  of the district, the Surveyor has  forhis  chief assistant the District Manager who has an independentoffice and a travelling staff of his own.  Normally the Telephone andthe  Surveying  Districts are  approximately co-terminous  and thereis only one District Manager in a Surveyor&apos;s District, but in some
llses there are two Telephone Districts and two District Managersboth working under  the same Surveyor.  The District Manager&apos;office  is divided  into  three  branches,  the  traffic branch, contractbranch and the clerical branch who are responsible respectively forthe service, salesmanship and accounting  sides of the telephone service.  The District  Manager is under the  authority  of  theSurveyor,  but the latter  appears to  a great  extent to leave  thecontrol of the Telephone Service in the District  to  the  DistrictManager, confining himself  mainly to the control of the postal and telegraph work of the District.  91. The arrangements in  the Postmaster  Surveyors Districts are broadly similar to those in the Surveyors&apos; Districts and differ onlyin detail.  92. The  Head  Office  areas  into which a Surveyors District  is divided are each under  the  control of  a Head Postmaster  situatedgenerally in the  largest  towns in the area.  The Head Postmasterit responsible for all  Post Office activities  in his area except thedirection of the telephone traffic and is in direct charge of all staff and buildings.  Under the Head Postmaster the postal centres areorganized into :       (1) Branch Offices.      (2)  Salaried Sub-Offices.      (3)  Scale Payment Sub-Offices.Generally  speaking,  these  types of  office may  be described   asfollows :        (1) Branch  Offices are  outposts of the Head Office in the    busier  parts of large towns  and their functions are practically    confined  to  counter work.   They  are  staffed by  Post Office    Civil Servants.      (2)  Salaried Sub-Offices may be either  similar to  Branch    Offices but conducting  a  smaller  volume of business, or they    may be the principal  office in a smaller town within the Head    Office district but outside  the Head Office town area, in which    case they act as postal,  despatching  and delivery centres  in    addition  to  providing counter  facilities.  In both cases,  like    Branch Offices,  they are staffed  by  established  Post Office    staff.      (3)  Scale  Payment Sub-Offices  are in effect agencies which    generally  combine  Post Office  duties  with private  business.    The Post Office  work  is  provided for  under contract by the    Sub-Postmaster  who, in return for an inclusive scale payment-    based on the volume of work, provides accommodation, fittings    and indoor staff.These  offices are the principal  offices in  the  smaller towns  and villages,  and constitute most of the  subordinate offices  in large towns.  In the towns the functions of Scale  Payment Sub-Officesare practically confined to counter work, but in the country districtsthey act as delivery  centres, and generally  accommodate a staff ofPostmen who are paid  directly by the Post Office.
  93. The telephone arrangements in the Head Postmasters distrii Iare not  quite  parallel with  postal and telegraph arrangements.The Head Postmaster is in control of  telephone staff and buildings in his area, but  the Telephone Exchanges are not always  in thesame building as  the Post Office, and in matters of telephone traffic,there  is a  considerable  amount of  direct  contact  between theExchanges and the District Manager&apos;s  staff  without  the interven-tion of the Head Postmaster.  94. The Engineering organization which is  responsible for the equipment and maintenance of the  Telephone and Telegraph Ser-vices is, however, entirely  separate from the Surveyors organiza-tion.   The Engineering District, which is under the SuperintendingEn gineer,  while  generally  co-terminous  with  the  Surveyor&apos;sDistrict is not always so defined, nor are the Headquarters of theSuperintending Engineers invariably in the same town as those ofthe Surveyor.  The Superintending Engineer&apos;s district is  dividedinto sections, each  of  which is in  charge  of an Engineer  with a subordinate staff of Assistant Engineers,  Inspectors and  SkilledWorkmen.   Neither the Surveyor nor any of his subordinates is in a positionto issue  instructions to the Superintending Engineer or his staff;the latter receive their instructions direct from the Engineer-in-Chief at Headquarters.   95.  The above outline briefly describes the main structure of thePost  Office organization.  The most interesting feature is the factthat the three main functions involved,  administration,  finance and engineering  run  parallel  throughout  the structure and  are  co-ordinated and focussed only at the  top in the person of the Secre-tary and his Secretariat officers.                        SECTION VIII.          The Defects of the Existing Organization.   96.  The Post  Office Secretariat has  come to assume a position which has no  parallel  in the Secretariat of any other GovernmentDepartment  and is in fact the sole source of authority under thePostmaster  General.   For  instance,  we  understand  that  no executive department of the Post Office can give  an instruction toanother department, nor can it through its own officers  do anythingfor which it has not Secretariat authority, either general or specific.By virtue of its autocratic position  the  Secretariat has  come toacquire  a status out  of proportion to that of other  Post Officedepartments.   97. Moreover, the present position of the Secretariat contraveneswhat has come  to  be  recognised as one of  the fundamental prin-ciples of organization, viz. : the  distinction  between policy and practice, between  the administrative and  the  executive functions.The  neglect of this important distinction we regard as one of  the
  am weaknesses of the existing Post Office organization.   It maynot be inappropriate to quote the words used by the Esher Committeenearly 30 years ago on this point, in regard to the organization ofdie Army : &quot; Attempts to combine the administrative and execu-live functions of the Army have led to confusion, to reduplication ofwork, to expense, to  dual control,  to divided  responsibility  . . .&quot;.The Secretariat  of the  Post  Office, as at present  constituted, isconcerned not only with the framing and formulation of policy andwith the supervision of its execution, but also with the conduct ofthe daily business of  the Post Office services, for which it is  un-suited, both by training and experience.  98.  We  have formed the impression  that individual  members ofthe Secretariat  possess considerable administrative ability but thatthe usurpation of executive functions  by the Secretariat, as a body,has in some cases deflected this ability into channels for which it is less well suited.  09.  The  administrative  staff of  the Secretariat  are recruitedthrough  the ordinary  Civil Service Administrative  Class Examina-tion; on joining  they  are appointed to the Secretariat and although in the first years of their service they  may be detached for a fewmonths to  the provinces for service under a Surveyor, they havehad quite inadequate  opportunity to acquire any thorough trainingin or experience  of, the  actual executive work  of  the  Post Office.Handicapped as  they  are by this absence of experience, they spend the remainder of their official career, not merely in administering,but to a considerable extent in  controlling,  the execution of servicesof which they may have considerable theoretical, but little practical,knowledge.  This absence of touch with the work  &quot; in the field &quot;, and conse-quent immunity from personal  contact with the public, has perhapstended to breed  in some cases  a certain aloofness and apparent in-difference to the demands of  the  public which is  probably at the root of the  criticism that the Post  Office attitude is one of  &quot; take itor leave it &quot;.  100. The autocratic isolation of  the Secretariat in relation to theEngineering and Accountant General&apos;s  departments and the marrowand specialised meaning attached to  the word  &quot; Administrative &quot;in respect  to  staff generally,  in  our  opinion,  prevent these two departments from taking an adequate part  in the general scheme ofcontrol.  101. In his own domain there is no evidence that the engineer isunduly hampered or  that  this department is inefficient  or unpro-gressive indeed  the  evidence  is to the contrary.   So  much so in-deed, that  we would take this opportunity of  recording  the highopinion we have  formed  of the capacity in general of the engineer -ing and technical staff, and equally of  the department of the Con-iroller of Stores.  But we believe that engineering experience isinsufficiently  brought into the consideration and formulation ofgeneral policy.
  We think that this incomplete synthesis of the administrative an,,3the technical sides tends to result not only in the administrative side-failing to give due weight to technical considerations, but also in thetechnical  side  failing  to realise  adequately  the  importance of administrative principles.  102. Similarly we believe  that the separation of the account a.ii&apos;GeneraPs department,  with  the general  efficiency of which we aivmuch impressed, has resulted in financial control being to a largeextent confined to the exercise of ex-post facto criticism, instead ofmanifesting itself by active participation in the administration.  103. The centralization of administration and the higher execn-tive functions in  the  Secretariat has  tended to  denude the  Sur-veyor and  the provincial staffs  of real  responsibility and authority.and has inevitably imposed an undue rigidity where, in contact withthe public, flexibility is required.  104. Finally, the divorce  of  the  engineering and administrativesides,  to which we have  already referred, has tended to  produceduality of  control and  absence of  co-ordination, while the separa-tion of finance, and the instruments of finance, from administration has  militated against  real decentralization because machinery formeasuring performance,  which effective decentralization  requires,does not exist.  105. As regards the  general structure of the provincial organiza-tion,  the   system  would  appear  to  us in  regard  to  postal services  to be  well  devised to meet requirements.  Head Post-masters and Sub-office Postmasters  should be allowed a somewhatfreer hand, particularly in regard to  staff, but we believe that these and similar improvements will come automatically, if and when the major changes in organization which we recommend become opera-tive.   In our view the main weakness of the system of provincialorganization is that which  permeates the Post Office as  a whole,viz. :-the  separation of the technical and the directive  side intowatertight  compartments,  with  consequent absence  of  propercorrelation  at the appropriate stage.     This weakness  manifestsitself particularly in the Telephone Service.                          SECTION IX.              Recommendations foe Reorganization.  106. We have  already made certain recommendations in regardto the financial status of the Post Office.   We  consider that full advantage cannot  be  taken of this change in financial  status towhich we attach considerable  importance, unless a correspondingchange is made in the system of organization of the Post Office.   107.  We feel that in dealing with an organization of the size and complexity of the Post Office, it  is not only impossible  for us toenter into details of organization, but also that any  such attempt
lm our part would  be detrimental  to the attainment of our objectwhich has throughout been to deal  with the root of the problem.  We conceive that our  task will best be fulfilled  and  our sug-nestions be of most  value, if we confine ourselves to the formulation of certain broad general principles of organization,  the applicationof which in detail must be left to others.  It must be recognizedthat in the pi-actical application of these principles  difficulties may arise, that  modifications may have to be made from time to timein the light of experience, and that  some time may elapse before theCull results are felt.  In our opinion, if  what we consider to be  sound principles ofurbanization once become operative, many  of the defects  to whichwe have  alluded in the course of this Report should automaticallydisappear,  or  their  occurrence  should become  so  rare as  tofurnish little ground for criticism.   It would, of course, be utterlyunreasonable to expect  that any  organization composed of over21 )0,000 persons can ever become  entirely immune from  a certainpercentage of error.  10S.  We believe that the genera! principles which should govern the organization of  the Post Office may be formulated as follows :       (1) The main  function  of  the  Headquarters  organization    should be to consider and determine policy.      (2) The main function of the  district organizations should    be the  execution  of  the general policy  prescribed by Head-    quarters and the practical application of the methods best suited    to that end.      (3) To fulfil these functions efficiently  all the activities     administrative, financial and technical which play a part, must    be co-ordinated at each  appropriate stage,  both of policy and    its execution, and directed towards the attainment of the object    in view, and not left to operate in parallel.      (4) The district organizations should be so constituted as to    enable them to carry out with as little hindrance as possible the    policy  laid down from above.  They,  in their  turn,   must be    able to  bring into their  administration at the lower level, in a    co-ordinated form,  the  various functional activities,  technical    and other,  necessary  to  the efficient execution of policy.  The    heads of the district organizations  should be judged  on their    performance.      (5)  The use of  the instruments of financial measurement    must be  decentralised  and  form  an integral part  of  local    administration in such a way  as to provide the local  adminis-    trator with the data necessary to measure his own performance,    to compare it with that of his colleagues, and to be judged by it.
                   Headquarters Organization.  109. We are  of opinion that the control of Post Office businesscan  best  be effected through  the  medium of a functional  Board,presided over by the Postmaster General.  In addition to the Assistant Postmaster General, the Board shouldcomprise  (say)  four or five members of the Post Office staff havingauthority over  all the various activities of the Department,  such functions as  the following  being represented upon it: GeneralOperating  and  Supply,  Engineering  and  Research,  Finance,Personnel,  etc.  Whilst in  our view the  general operations of the  Post  Offkvlend themselves to a  broad differentiation on the above lines, we appreciate the fact that, in practice, some other form of classificationmight be considered preferable.  110. Apart from  his Parliamentary responsibilities, the duties ofthe Chairman of the  Board (i.e., the Postmaster General) wouldbe to ensure co-ordination of the various broad aspects  of policy inconsultation with his  Board colleagues.  The Postmaster Generalmust have the power of over-ruling the Board in any matter of policy as Minister responsible to Parliament.  111. Since  we regard it as of the greatest importance that thereshould  be  no break  in  the  line of  authority from the top  tothe bottom, we are of opinion that the senior permanent  memberof the Board, who in the absence of the Postmaster  General would act as Chairman and preside, should be given a position equivalentto that of Chief Executive with some such title as Director General.It should be  his duty, under the chairmanship of successive Post-masters General, to ensure that Board decisions are made effective,that continuity  and unity of  policy  are maintained, and that thegeneral machine of  administration works smoothly and effectively.His  position relative to the other members of the  Board,  would bethat of &quot; primus inter pares &quot;.  Having regard to the general responsibility devolving upon him,we consider he  should be freed from all duties associated with thecontrol of any specific  department.  112. The duties of the Board should as far as possible be restricted to the consideration and  formulation of policy, and to such broadissues of administration and direction as involve collective delibera-tion and decision.   No departmental member should be  burdenedwith  such onerous executive  duties and responsibilities  as would interfere with his  effectiveness as a Board  member, or  with his capacity to  consider and adjudicate on general problems of adminis-tration, i.e., he should not have so much routine work to do thathe cannot  see  the wood  for  the  trees.  He w^ould, however,  be
16863-personally responsible through the Chief Executive to the Board forthe particular operations coming within his sphere.  This being so,it follows that  each member should be supported and assisted bycompetent  deputies and heads of  departments, to whom should be delegated ample powers of initiative and control.            Provincial  ayid Metropolitan Organization.   113. As  regards the  provincial  or district  organization, detailedre-organization will inevitably  take some considerable period oftime  and can  in  our opinion best be  undertaken by the Boardwhose creation we have recommended  above.  We propose, there-fore, to confine our recommendations to the general lines which weconsider that such re-organization should follow.   114. In  accordance  with the principles  we  have formulated inParagraph  108, we consider that the  head of the district organizationshould be the main instrument for translating into effect the policyprescribed  by the Headquarters Board.   115. While we  hesitate to recommend the  abolition of a  titlehallowed, we understand,  by a tradition of considerable antiquity,we consider that the  title  of Surveyor is misleading and should be changed to, say, that of Regional Director.   116. We  regard it as of vital importance that the Regional Directorshould exercise jurisdiction over all the functions  appertaining tothe Post, Telephone  and  Telegraph Services.  He should be theco-ordinating authority for his Region  and his organization would,in effect, be a reproduction in miniature of the Headquarters Board.The Regional Director  would be the Chief Executive of his region and would  be assisted by a staff representing engineering, financialand personnel  functions, and  within  his  Region   engineering,finance and personnel would be under  his  jurisdiction.  He would receive, direct,  and execute, all orders from Headquarters in consul-tation with his technical,  financial  and personnel staff and would ensure that all  the interests involved were co-ordinated and broughtinto focus.   His status and responsibility  would be correspondingly increased as compared with that  of the existing Surveyor.   117. As regards the Metropolitan organization, we  consider  that having regard to the special conditions  obtaining in the Metropolis,the existing system  should,  at any  rate for the present,  continue,but here again we consider that provision  should be  made for theControllers of the London Postal, Telephone and Telegraph services to exercise jurisdiction  over the engineering staff employed in their area.   118. Constant contact should be maintained  between the variousRegional Directors who should be encouraged to visit one another&apos;sRegions and to exchange  views and information.   Similarly,  close
contact should exist between the Regions and  Headquarters, anumembers of the Board should pay regular visits to Regions and dis-cuss matters of interest with Regional Directors.  119. Experience alone can determine  the best method of givingpractical effect to the ideas underlying  these suggestions,  but woconsider that an organization evolved  on these  lines should securethe main desiderata, viz. : decentralization and the co-ordinationat the appropriate levels of the principal functional activities.                            Staffing.  120. The scheme of  re-organization such as we have indicated,to be successful, must be  accompanied by a radical change in theexisting  methods of staffing the  more  important administrativeposts.  The  existing  division between  the  Secretariat and the  restof the  staff should  be  removed,  and fluidity  of interchange  ofstaff between Headquarters and the provinces secured.    To  this principle we attach the  greatest importance.  As a rule no officers should be appointed to  an administrative position of importance  at headquarters unless  and until he has  had a thorough training in,and experience of, the  actual work of the Post  Office in  the pro-vinces.   In  the  selection of officers for the higher administrativeposts, the decision should be influenced by suitability rather than byseniority.  On the assumption that the normal Administrative Classrecruitment continues and on the whole we advocate its continuance,we consider that the first years of service should  be spent in theprovinces, and that the officer should then be transferred to Head-quarters  only  if  he shows promise  and after  careful selection.After a period of service at Headquarters, he should then be trans-ferred  to the  provinces to  a more responsible position and subse-quently,  if he continues to develop as an administrator he would return to Headquarters.  At a certain  stage in his  career he wouldprobably show signs of a  natural  aptitude either towards Head-quarters  administration  or  towards  the  more  practical  executivework  of  the provinces, and his ultimate position would  be deter-mined by this factor.  121. We believe that  a system of interchange on these lines would ensure that Headquarters were in touch with the practical problem?of the work in the  provinces  and that  the provincial staff wereacquainted with the  problems of general policy  with which Head-quarters were concerned.  To secure that interchange of staff will work smoothly and with-out friction, it is essential that there should be no difference in statusbetween the administrative staff at Headquarters  and in  the pro-vinces, and that, like for like, they should stand on an equal footing,  122. It has on several occasions been  represented to us that theengineer has no access  to the highest administrative positions, andthat consequently the efficiency of an administration which is  so
 Innately concerned with technical matters is thereby impaired. ,&quot;c believe that under  a  scheme such as we have adumbrated, the igineer will be able to  play a larger and more effective part in ic  determination  and  execution of policy.  As  regards  access to Iministrative posts, we  consider that there should be no bar to a chnical officer holding such posts, provided he has shown himself to possess  administrative ability.   Generally speaking, we think it i be true  that the specialist in any walk of life tends to remain a iecialist;  but there are  of  course  well-known exceptions to the mtrary, and  we  consider that where a member of  the technical staff has shown that he possesses  administrative  talent, he should e eligible  for other appointments. 123. We recognize that there are considerable difficulties in ensur- ig that members of the  Engineering staff have access to admin is- ;:iive  positions,  especially  since  they  would tend  to  enter the dininistrative hierarchy at a later  age, and at a higher point, than u officer recruited direct into the Administrative  Class.   We think int regional Directors should be  instructed to be on the look out ir promising technical officers on  their staff who have shown ad-ininistrative  ability, and  that the names of such  officers should be msidered  by the appropriate Selection Board on their  merits, in mipetition with other  candidates  for promotion. 124. We consider that  following on the  principle of interchangewhich we have advocated above, recruits for the higher staff of the regions should normally be obtained from the Civil Service Adminis-trative Class Examination.  Candidates  who accept the Post office should, however, realise that once in the Service their  prospects willbe determined by the ability they show under conditions, and ontypes of work, somewhat different from  those  obtaining  in theordinary Government Department;  that the initial  stage of  theircareer will be spent in  the provincial Regions and that in regard topromotion  they will be judged on their merits  in competition withmen from technical and other classes, such as officers  of the Execu-live  class and  Traffic sections, to whom equally  with Engineeringofficers, we consider an  opportunity should be given of  access to administrative positions while they are in  their prime. 125. If our recommendations as to the staffing of  Headquarters in!  Regions by a common and interchangeable administrative staffire  adopted we consider  that  the responsible  regional  officers liould be represented on  the appropriate Promotion Board whether nth Boards are considering promotions to Headquarters or Regional icancies.               The Post Office  Advisory Council. 126. The Advisory Council should act in a  consultative capacity md  should be  consulted by the Postmaster-General on questions of general policy.  It should serve  as a connecting  link between the Post Office and the public and, if effectively used, would, as repre- enting the  public as  a  whole,  strengthen the hand of the  Post
Office in dealing with the claims  of particular interests.   Memblfiof the Council should be entitled to raise items for discussion on theAgenda.                         SECTION X.                    General Conclusions.  127. To  sum up: We do  not consider that the change in thestatus of the  Post Office to that of a  Public Utility Company or statutory Authority, either  wholly or in part, is desirable.  In thepublic interest we feel that  the Parliamentary control which existsat present  is  essential in a business  of such  a national  character,Nor do  we  feel assured that  a  change of this kind would remedy the alleged  defects of  administration.   The  criticisms,  so far as we  find them to be  justified, in ouropinion point to defects in  the present organization which can be remedied without  such a complete change of status.   128.  The first of these defects is over-centralization  at Head-quarters.  In the  Fost Office  the Secretariat has acquired a domin-ating power which has imposed on the service a bureaucracy morerigid than  that of any other department.  We suggest that instead  of the present system, a Board shouldbe  established representative  of  the various functions  involved;that the Chairman should  be the Postmaster General and that a director-General who would in effect be a General Manager, should act as  Deputy Chairman, and that  the policy of the Post  office should  be  decided by  the Board,  and carried  out all over thecountry by a reorganization of staff, of which  details are  given  inparagraphs 113-125, and in  accordance with the principles indicatedin  paragraph 108.  This would  give  more freedom of action  inmatters of detail and more  authority to provincial officials.   129.  The other  most serious defect we think is the fact that al!the  Post Office  profits are  taken by the -Treasury.  This  removesfrom the Post Office a natural incentive to progress and economy.We realise that  a  large sum is required by  the Chancellor finRevenue, but we think that this  sum might be fixed for three years at  some figure approximate  to  the present  amount  which  theRevenue absorbs,  and that any  savings  above that amount shouldbe available for improvements in the  service,  subject to the least possible interference by the  Treasury.  Details  will be found  inparagraphs 62-73.   130.  The  effect of our two principal suggestions  should  be  togive greater freedom and elasticity to the service, and more oppor-tunity  to  the experts to utilise their  skill and experience in the advancement of the efficiency of the service, and in the  interest.;of  the public.   131.  In  an organization  such  as the  Post Office, which dependsso much  upon  scientific discoveries and developments and theiipractical application, we consider it essential to  bring engineering and research into  more intimate touch with the general problems of
([ministration.    The object  of this closer  relationship is two-fold ; the engineer, on the one hand, will be in a position to visualisethe picture as a whole, and thus to direct his activities into thosechannels where the need  for progress and development is greatest;ffliile, on the other hand,  those who are charged with the day-to-daytunning of the administrative machine will be able to avail them-selves of the scientific point of view to the fullest extent.  132.  Our other  main recommendations, details  of which will befound in our  Report, may be briefly summarised as follows :      (1) The Telegraph Service  should be  completely amalga-   mated with the Telephone Service  (para. 24).     (2) Attention should be paid to the systematic training for   the supervision  of personnel  employed upon  telephone con-   struction and  maintenance (para. 27).     (3)  Consideration  should be given to the  standard of tele-   phone construction in thinly populated areas  (para. 28).     (4)  The  objections to the employment of women  telephone   operators up to 11  p.m. should be reconsidered (para. 32).     (5) Staff management should be  decentralized  to the fullest   possible extent and the right of appeal to Headquarters should   be restricted   (para.  40).     (6) The existing  relationship  between the  Post Office and   the Office of Works in regard to the provision  and maintenance   of  accommodation,  furniture,  etc., should continue  (paras.   75-77).     (7)  Stationery Office.         (a) The ordinary  departmental  printing  common to       Government Departments  should continue to be done by       the Stationery Office.         (b) Directory  printing should remain with the Station-       ery  Office  but   the  Post  Office should  have access to       Stationery Office accounts  and  should be entitled to refer       charges under dispute to the Treasury.         (c)  Security, including stamp printing,  required for Post       Office Services should be put out to competitive tender, the       Stationery Office being invited to  tender together with       outside firms         (paras.  81-82).     (8)  The Advisory  Council should  be consulted  by the Post-   master General on questions of general policy and be regarded   as  a connecting link between  the  Post  Office  and the  public   (para. 126).  133.  Before concluding our report we wish to take the oppor-ninity  of  making  some  general observations,  which,  we think,    attention.  Recognizing  that  there are  certain  defects in the Post Officeret cm  of organization, we have attempted  to suggest  how theseMeets can, in our opinion, best be remedied.  At the same time we
wish to place on record our opinion that on the whole the Post Of;,()performs the  services for which it is responsible with remarkableefficiency.   If we have criticised the organization and drawn atten.tion to certain shortcomings, we have done so in the hope that suchcriticism will  prove constructive.  134. While it  may be true that the attitude of the Post Officetowards its clients,  the public, does on occasion show a certainlack of imagination and adaptability,  it  is  perhaps equally  true to say that the attitude of the public towards the Post Office leavessomething to  be desired.  No organization can fail to be adversely affected when on the one hand it is denied credit that is its due, andon  the  other, is subjected to continuous and often  unfair and tin-informed criticism.   In such circumstances the staff cannot fail  tobecome disheartened and demoralised.   Prom the evidence we have heard  and  from  personal observation  we believe that the vaguegeneralizations as to inefficiency and  discourtesy on the part of the subordinate staff are exaggerated.  Instances do undoubtedly occur,but we believe  that the staff  as a whole are genuinely anxious  tcgive their best service to the public, and we see no reason to believethat they  compare unfavourably  so far as  efficiency is concernedwith any other body of employees of similar  magnitude.  135.  As regards  the higher  directing and controlling staff bothadministrative and  technical,  we  have  formed the impression thatit comprises men of first  rate  ability judged by any standard.  Itis,  however, vital that the existing system should be so modified a;to enable a better use to be made of such material, and a fuller scopegiven to the capacity and initiative that we  are confident exists; itis our  belief  that the adoption of our recommendations will have this effect.  136.  The Committee have received every assistance from the PostOffice in the course of  their enquiry and have been impressed  bjthe ability, candour and freedom from prejudice of  all the officialwitnesses  who have given evidence before them.  137.  We wish to put on record our very warm  appreciation of the  able services rendered by Mr. Austin  Earl, C.B.E., our  Secre-tary.   He has been indefatigable in ascertaining all the information for which  we asked, and in arranging tne business of the Committs with skill and consideration for ourselves  and all the witnesses andothers who have been concerned.  We are greatly indebted to him for the invaluable help he has rendered to  our Committee.                                                Bridgeman.                                                Plender.                                                John Cadman. Austin Earl,     (Secretary).10th August, 1932.  .
