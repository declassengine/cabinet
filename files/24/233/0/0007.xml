THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  September 1932.CONFIDENTIAL.                                       Copy  No.   36CP.  308 (32).                                CABINET.POSITION OF HIS MAJESTY*S REPRESENTATIVE IN IRAQ                     UNDER NEW  REGIME.          Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    MY colleagues will recollect that at a  meeting of  the  Cabinet on  the4th August  it was decided to leave the question of the status of His Majesty&apos;representative in Iraq, after the termination of the mandatory regime, on theagenda paper of the Cabinet until the Secretary of State for India and I had hadan opportunity of consulting the High Commissioner for Iraq, who was  thenexpected home on leave.    The actual status which His Majesty&apos;s Representative will possess is laiddown in an exchange of notes attached to the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliancewhich will come into force with the termination of the  mandatory regime.   Thisexchange of notes provides that  the British Diplomatic Representative in  Iraqshall have the status of an Ambassador and enjoy permanent precedence over the diplomatic Representatives of all other Powers.    The Secretary of State for  India brought the  question before the Cabinetbecause he was anxious that the special position of the  Ambassador should bedifferentiated in another way from that of other diplomats in Iraq, namely, that,in view of his special responsibilities in connexion with the presence in Iraq ofthe Royal Air Force, the Ambassador should be in a  position to call upon theBritish advisers  to  the  Iraqi  Government for information  regarding Iraq&apos;internal affairs.    Paragraph 2 of Article 1 of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance  lays down that: &quot; There shall be established between the High Contracting Parties a close alliance ....  and there shall be full and frank consultation between them in all matters of foreign policy which may affect their  common  interests &apos;&apos;; and it was felt during the negotiations which led up to the Treaty that it would be incon-sistent with the status of Iraq as an independent country which she will becomeon the termination of the mandatory regime and her admission to the League ofNations to provide in a treaty instrument for  a greater measure  than this of direct intervention in Iraqi affairs by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador.   On the otherhand, it was felt  that  the Ambassador&apos;s position would be such as to give himample opportunities for unofficial intervention whenever such intervention mightbe necessary.    My colleagues will appreciate  the objections to any regular system underwhich all British officials remaining in the service  of the Iraqi Government, asadvisers, should communicate information to the British Diplomatic Representa-tive.  Such a system, if it became known, would be represented  in certain foreigncircles as confirmation of  the  suspicion  which already exists  there  that  HisMajesty&apos;s Government, while relinquishing the responsibilities of the  Mandate,will retain its  advantages.   The Treaty of Alliance has itself  been severely criticised on these grounds and was only grudgingly approved  by the Council ofthe League; and if the above system were instituted and became known, we should certainly  be accused of having  retained  an excessive  degree  of  control in the iraqi Administration,  and of developing a system of British intelligence officersin that Administration for our own ends.6546  [7596]
    Furthermore,  the retention  of  British  advisers  in  Iraq is by no  meansuniversally popular in that country, and the system would lead to attacks upon them  in Nationalist and anti-British circles.  Thus, not  only would embarrass-ments and&apos;difficulties be created  for His Majesty&apos;s Representative  in Iraq andfor His Majesty&apos;s Government, but the position of the British  advisers to the iraqi Government might also be rendered untenable.    At the same time, the situation in Iraq, owing to the  Treaty of Alliance andthe presence of the Royal Air  Force, will be unusual  and calls  for unusualmethods, so far as these can safely be taken, for it is clearly desirable that thefuture Ambassador should have  access to the fullest possible information as towhat  is going on in the country.    I have now discussed the question with Sir F. Humphrys, and he would liketo have authority to arrange privately with King Feisal and the Iraqi PrimeMinister that he shall from time to time receive,  through a single-well-placedBritish official, namely, Sir Kinahan Cornwallis, who  is  Senior British adviser to the Iraqi  Government, news of importance affecting the internal security ofthe country, so as to be in a position to advise, in the event of the services of theRoyal Air Force being requested to deal with internal troubles.    Sir F. Humphrys is confident that this procedure will be regarded as entirelynatural, and that King Feisal and his Prime Minister will raise no objection.    The future Ambassador  will, in fact, in  the  ordinary  course, receiveinformation of increasing value from the British Consular Officers who are about to be  appointed in various parts of the country, but the  special position of the ambassador  appears  to me completely to justify the  additional step which sir F. Humphrys has suggested  and which I recommend that he be authorisedto take.    In my view, and in that of  the Secretary  of State for India, the proposed arrangement will  satisfy all the requirements of  the situation,  so long  at all events as  Sir F. Humphrys, with the great personal  prestige which he enjoys,occupies the post of  Ambassador.  When it has been tested by experience, or atall events when Sir F. Humphrys vacates the post, it may  be advisable to attemptto place the arrangement on a written basis.  Sir F. Humphrys&apos;s own suggestionis that, when eventually writing to take leave of the Iraqi Government, he should express the hope that the Iraqi Government will be willing to extend to his successors the same facilities for obtaining information as had been enjoyed by himself, and request the authority of the Iraqi Government to inform his successorthat such will be the case.   It  seems most unlikely that such a request, made inthe circumstances contemplated, would meet with a refusal.                                                                    J  S    September 20, 1932.
