\141[This  document is the Property o  His Britannic Majesty^ Government.]                Printed for ihe Cabinet.  September 1932.                                                     Copy No..........                              CABINET.               Modification of Communal Award.       MEMORANDUM  BY  THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.   I circulate for the information of my colleagues        (1) The  text  of  the agreement  concluded   between the  caste Hindus and    Depressed Classes on Saturday, 24th September, which reached us that afternoon,    with  an urgent request from the signatories that the Government should accept    its provisions in place of those  relating to the representation of the  Depressed    Classes contained in the Governments Award of 4th August last.       (2) The  announcement on behalf of the Government which was made in the    Indian Legislature on Monday morning.   The terms of this statement, in which  the Government of  India concurred, were approved by the Prime Minister.   I had  received information  that  the doctors considered Mr. Gandhi was  not farfrom a critical period, and it was necessary to  give an immediate  reply.   There was,therefore, no opportunity for consrdtation with my colleagues before action was taken.I do not think, however, that there could have been  any real doubt as to the course tobe followed.   We had, in our decision of 4th August, expressly pledged ourselves that if we were&quot; satisfied that  the  communities who are concerned are  mutually agreed  upon  apractical alternative scheme, either in respect of anyone or more of the  Governors&apos;Provinces, or in respect of the whole of  British India,&quot; we  would substitute thealternative for our own scheme.  Whatever  the merits of the new agreement, asto which I will say a word below, it can hardly be said to be impracticable,  and theonly  real  question before us was  whether it constituted an agreement between the communities concerned.  For the Depressed Classes it was signed by practically all their leaders of note.  On the  caste  Hindu side we had the  agreement  of Gandhi(though he did not actually sign the document), of Pandit Malaviya and Mr. Jayakar,that  is to say  that  we had  the approval  of representatives of the Congress, HinduMahasabha  and the  Indian Liberals.   It would  hardly have  been  possible forGovernment,  to  take the line that these were not adequate  representatives of the hindu community.   It is no doubt likely that the agreement will meet with a good deal of opposition from  more orthodox Hindus.    Perhaps the most  serious difficulty which  may beanticipated  is  objection from  the caste  Hindus  of the  Punjab  who  were  not represented.  Eight reserved seats  are  provided for the Depressed Classes  in that province, whereas  there are none under our  decision.  It seems  to me, however,that  that must  be a question  between the Punjab  Hindus  and the  other Hinduleaders, and  that we could not  afford to refuse to recognise  the agreement  on thatacoount.   As regards the merits  of the  scheme,  it is not easy to give any very confidentopinion.   In some  places it  is  possible that the caste Hindus  may be able to securethe election of Depressed Class  candidates entirely subservient to them, but it will beby: no means easy for  them to achieve this.  The numbers  of  reserved seats areapproximately on a population basis.  The  main objection from a general standpointis that  the  quality of the Legislatures is bound to suffer from the presence of so large a block  of  uneducated members.  On the whole it may be said  that Dr. Ambedkarhas  driven  a remarkably good  bargain for  the Depressed Classes, which the  casteHindus may very well repent before long, even if they do not immediately.   It will be seen that it is necessary to make  partial reservations regarding certain points outside the scope of  our Award.      INDIA  OFKICE,                                                      S. H.  26th September 1932.SECRET.CP. 318 (32).1253    60 9.32
   ...  .                         Text of Agreement.&quot;    The following agreement has been arrived at between leaders  acting on behalf ofthe  Depressed  Classes  and  of the rest of  the  Hindu community regarding the representation of the Depressed Classes in the Legislatures and certain  other matters affecting their welfare :        &quot; 1. There shall be seats reserved for the Depressed Classes out of the general     electorate seats in the  Provincial Legislatures as follows :  Madras, 30 ; Bombay     with Sind,  15 ;  Punjab,  8;   Bihar and  Orissa,  18;   Central Provinces,  20&quot;;     Assam, 7 ;  Bengal, 30 ;  the United Provinces, 20 ; total, 148.  These figures are     based on the total strength  of the Provincial Councils announced  in the Prime     Ministers decision.       &quot; 2. Election to these seats  shall be by joint electorates, subject, however, to     the following procedure : All members of the Depressed Classes  registered in the     general electoral roll of a constituent will form an electoral college which will     elect a panel of four candidates belonging to the Depressed  Classes for each of     such reserved seats by the  method of the single vote and four persons getting the     highest  number  of votes  in such primary election shall be the candidates for     election  by the general electorate.       &quot; 3. The representation  of the Depressed Classes in  the  Central Legislature     shall likewise be on the principle of joint electorates and  reserved seats by the     method  of  primary election in the manner provided for in  clause 2 above for     their representation in the  Provincial Legislatures.       &quot; 4. In  the  Central  Legislature  18  per centum of the seats allotted to the     general electorate for British India in the said Legislature shall be reserved for     the Depressed Classes.       &quot; 5. The system of primary election to a panel of candidates for election to the     -Central and Provincial Legislatures  as hereinbefore mentioned shall come  to an     end after the first 10 years unless terminated sooner by mutual agreement under     the provisions of clause 6 below.       &quot; 6. The system of representation  of Depressed Classes by reserved seats in     the Provincial and Central Legislatures as provided for in clauses  1 and 4  shall     continue until  determined &quot;by  mutual  agreement between the  communities     -concerned in this settlement.       &quot; 7. The franchise for the Central and Provincial Legislatures for  the Depressed     Classes shall be as indicated in the Lothian Committee Report.       &quot; 8. There shall be no disabilities attaching to anyone on the ground of his     being a member of the Depressed Classes in  regard  to any elections to  local     bodies or appointment to the public services.   Every endeavour  shall be made to     secure a fair representation of the Depressed  Classes in  these  respects, subject     to  such  educational qualifications as may be laid down for  appointment to the     public services.       &quot; 9. In every Province out of the  educational grant an adequate sum shall be     earmarked  for providing educational facilities- for the members  of the Depressed     Classes.&quot;   Statement on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, made in the Indian Legislature                     on the morning of Monday, 26th September.    His Majesty&apos;s  Government has learnt with great  satisfaction that an  agreement&apos;has been reached  between leaders  of the Depressed  Classes  and of the  rest of the hindu community regarding  the  representation of the Depressed Classes in the newLegislatures and certain other matters affecting their welfare.    In place of the system of general constituencies combined with special DepressedClass constituencies  contained in the Governments  Communal Award of 4th Augustlast, the agreement provides for general constituencies within which seats are reservedfor the Depressed Classes, subject to important conditions as to the manner in whichthe reserved seats are filled.   * It appears from an unofficial telegram thnt the signatories were : M. M. Malaviya, T. B. Supra, M. R.Jayakar, U. R. Ambedkur, R. Srinivasan,  O. Rajngopalachari, Chuuilal Merita, M. 0. Rajah, P. G. Solanki,V. I. .Muriiswamypillay, V. Dharmalingam, Pillxi Haridas, N. Shivaraj,  G.  I).  Birla, Rajendraprasad,A. Y&apos;. Thakkar, H. M. Jagannathan,  S. N.  Shivatarkar, 13. H. Verale, R. R. Bakhlo, P. Baloo,.Rajbhoj,N. S. Kajrolker, G. A. Gavai, and apparently live  others unnamed.
14    The  Government,  in  their Award which was given  in  the absence of  agreement between the communities, were solely concerned, in relation to the Depressed Classes, to provide adequate security that the interests of these classes should  be observed  by the new Legislatures.   As  the representatives  of  the Depressed Classes  and other Hindus  acting  together believe that  the scheme  now  forwarded by them  to  His Majesty&apos;s Government  is adequate  for that purpose, the Government, in accordance with  the procedure which they laid down in  paragraph  4 of their  Award, will recommend to Parliament in due course the adoption of  the clauses of the  agreement dealing with representation in  the  Provincial Legislatures in place of the provisions in paragraph 9  of  the Award.  It  will be understood that the total number of the general  seats  including those  reserved for Depressed Classes under the agreement, will in each Province remain the same as the number of general seats plus the number of special Depressed Class seats provided in their decision.    His  Majesty&apos;s Government note that the  agreement  deals also  with  certain questions outside the  scope of their Award of 4th  August.  Clauses 8 and 9 deal generally with points, the realisation of  which will be likely to depend in the main on actual working of the Constitution.   But His Majesty&apos;s Government take note of these clauses as a definite pledge of intention of caste Hindus towards Depressed  Classes.    There are two other points outside the scope of their Award : (1)  The Agreement contemplates  that  the franchise for the Depressed Classes  should  be that recom- mended  by  the Franchise (Lord Lothian&apos;s) Committee.   It is obvious  that the level of the Franchise for  the Depressed  Classes (indeed,  for  Hindus  generally) must  be determined at the  same time as that for other communities is being settled, and the whole  subject  is  under  consideration  by  His  Majesty&apos;s Government ;  (2)  the Agreement  also  provides  for a  particular method of  electing Depressed Class h representatives  for  the Legislature at. the Centre.   This again is a  subject (outside the terms of their Award)  which is under investigation  as part of the whole scheme for election for  the Legislature at the  Centre, and no piecemeal conclusion  can be reached.    What has been  said on these two points should  not  be regarded as implying that His Majesty&apos;s Government  are against what is  proposed in the  Agreement, but that these questions  are still under consideration.    To prevent misunderstanding it may be explained that the Government regard  the figure of 18 per cent, for the percentage of British India general seats at the Centre to be reserved for  the Depressed Classes  as a matter for  settlement between them and-other Hindus.
