THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  October 1932.SECRET.                                               Copy No.    53CP.  338 (32).CABINET.DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE.     MY colleagues will wish to appreciate what developments have taken place since the decision of the Cabinet on the 30th September that we should endeavour to secure the return of Germany to  the Disarmament Conference by calling  in the aid of the Declaration of Mutual  Consultation of the 13th July last,  to which the French, Germany, Italian and United Kingdom Governments are all parties (Cabinet 49 (32), Conclusions (b) and (c)).  I therefore summarise the course  of subsequent events, most of which are set  out at length in the telegrams which have been circulated.     2.  Our Ambassadors at Paris, Berlin and Rome were instructed to com- municate to those three Governments our suggestion  of a meeting between the four of us  in London at an early date for an exchange of  views with the object of overcoming the difficulty which has arisen through the withdrawal of Germany from the disarmament  discussions at Geneva.  The communication laid stress on the applicability of the terms of  the Declaration of Mutual Consultation  to this situation, and tentatively suggested Tuesday,  the 11th October, as a possible date  for  the  meeting.   (Foreign  Office  telegram No.  166 to  Paris of the 30th September.)  At the same time, the United States Government were informed of this invitation, and we expressed the earnest hope that they might be prepared to associate themselves in some way  with  this exchange of views in London.  I saw Mr. Davis at  Geneva and got him to  cable to Mr. Stimson, urging that the proposed London  Conference was really a resumption of informal discussions in which Mr.  Stimson took part at  Geneva.   Mr. Henderson  was informed  of Avhat we were doing,  and also the Secretary-General  at Geneva.     3.  The reaction to our proposal has been as follows :      ITALY  accepted  the  invitation  promptly  and   unconditionally,  and Signor Mussolini  has nominated Signor Grandi  as his representative for the purpose (Rome telegram No. 142 of the 4th October).     GERMANY did not,  at first, give a definite reply, and Herr von Bulow saw to it that in the interval difficulties were suggested and  no enthusiasm was shown. But, when  it became  known that the French Government  disliked the idea of meeting in London, German approval of the plan began to show  itself, and on Friday  the German  Government definitely  accepted the  British invitation. Herr von bulow has described the acceptance as &quot;unconditional.-&apos;  The text of the German acceptance is, for convenience, printed as Annex I.    FRANCE was, from the first, strongly opposed to  the  plan of a four-Power talk in London.  I saw M. Herriot on  the subject in Paris on the 4th October, and the record  has been circulated in the form of a despatch  (No.  2040), dated the5th October, from me to Lord Tyrrell.  M. Herriot still  showed himself critical ofthe plan, though he did not actually  say that he would not attend a conferencein London,  and we made further representations to him, conceding that the dateof meeting might be somewhat postponed,  and that  there would be opportunityfor preliminary talk with  him  in the meantime.  The  French reply was handed to Lord Tyrrell on Thursday, and is  printed as  Annex II.   It amounts  to this :that France, while not averse  from  a  &quot;meeting between  Powers &quot; (not, be  itnoted, &quot; between the four Powers &quot;).  wants the meeting to be at Geneva and not      6564  [7701]
in London.  At the same time M. Herriot wrote a private letter reinforcing thisview, declaring his conviction that Germany means to rearm, and emphasisingFrance&apos;s intention to make  a  real  contribution towards  disarmament.   he suggests that before the  meeting is held there might be an  Anglo-Frenchconsultation, and Lord Tyrrell tells me that M. Herriot is quite ready to come toLondon for  the purpose  of  this consultation any  day in the week beginningthe 9th  October.     THE UNITED STATES has made no formal answer to our communication,but there is reason to think that Mr. Hoover, in view of bis electoral difficulties,will be  very unwilling to take  a step which might be  represented as a newintervention  in European  affairs.  However. Mr. Norman Davis is in Londonand will. I am sure, help our object in every way he can.     4.  The  broad result is that the British demarche, after meeting with much criticism for some days, seems likely to produce a positive result.  Germany andItaly would prefer the meeting to take place in London, but would not, [ think,absolutely veto a meeting elsewhere.   France opposes a meeting in London andwants it at Geneva  and no  doubt wants to bring  to the discussion the repre-sentatives of  Poland, Belgium  and Czechoslovakia.  If M. Herriot  pays his private  visit to London this  week, we might compromise  with him by agreeing that the meeting shall be at  Geneva, say, about the 25th October (immediatelyafter the second reading of the Ottawa Bill), but at the same time  might stipulate that it  should be limited to  the Powers  we have invited.  There are,  however.a good many difficulties to be got over.  Mr. Henderson has returned to geneva and is himself conducting conversations with M. Herriot and Herr von Neurathon the basis of his draft Resolution, which was printed as an Annex to my paper cp.  326 (32).   I am told that Herr  von Neurath  will  be at Geneva for  theAssembly of  the League of Nations until this adjourns, next Thursday, but itis rather difficult to see how his presence at Geneva can  be secured after that.     5.  Lastly, and most important of all,  we have to decide what our line isto be when the meeting takes place.  Germany  will  most  certainly not comeback  to the Disarmament  Conference without receiving  an  acknowledgment ofher claim to equality of status. The British Note of the 18th September contained a proposition which amounts to  admitting this claim in  a certain sense, but itsmeaning has  been widely distorted or misunderstood and would require a clearerdefinition.&apos; It would be the  purpose of  the proposed  preliminary conversationwith  M. Herriot to  formulate such a  definition and get him to accept it.   Mysuggestion  would  be that on the question  of  principle  we  should try to  getFrance and Italy to agree with us upon a public statement that the contemplatedDisarmament Convention would cancel out completely the relevant disarmamentclauses of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles  so that ihe latter would not revive onthe expiry of the Disarmament Convention.  Having made this joint declaration,we should  indicate that the  German  Governments material claim  for variousreadjustments in germany&apos;s  present armaments to be embodied in the proposedDisarmament Convention must be regarded as matters for negotiation at Genevawhen Germany has resumed  her place there, as our declaration on  the  questionof principle would enable  her to do.

I HAVE the honour to acknowledge with thanks the receipt of your note ofthe 3rd October, in which you communicated the invitation of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to a meeting of the  Ministers of Germany, France, Great Britainand Italy in London for a discussion of the difficulties which have arisen in theDisarmament Conference.    The German  Government are ready at any time  to enter  into a frankexchange of views  with the  Governments mentioned  in your  note regarding a beneficial  and equitable solution  (&quot; zweckmassige und billige  Ldsung &quot;) of  thedisarmament question.   They rely upon the  final  declaration  of Lausanneaccording to  which, in addition to the results then achieved, a solution of other outstanding questions should also be sought with the object &quot; of creating a new order which would make possible the establishment and development of confidencebetween the  nations in the  mutual spirit of reconciliation, collaboration and justice.&quot;   If these guiding  principles of the Lausanne  declaration constitute the starting  point of the  meeting proposed by His Majesty&apos;s Government,  theGerman Government hope  that it will succeed  in finding a solution which willmake it possible  for  Germany  to resume  participation  in  the  work  of  theDisarmament Conference, the successful outcome of which the German Govern-ment  desire.  The German Government cannot, however, conceal the fact that a conversation  on the basis of the French and English notes of the 11th and 18thSeptember last would  be  unlikely to attain the object of an understandingregarding the questions in dispute.    As regards the date of the proposed meeting, the German Government, havingregard to the Assembly  of the League of Nations in Geneva, would prefer that a somewhat later date than that suggested should be envisaged.             /                                                     I have. &amp;c                                             (Signed)      VON BTJLOW.ANNEX II.(Translation.)Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Paris.                               M emorandum. *  ON the 3rd October His Majesty&quot;s Government were so good as to inform theFrench Government through His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris of the  graveanxiety which they felt on account of the withdrawal of Germany from thediscussions on disarmament at Geneva.    In order to  remedy this situation Plis  Majesty&apos;s  Government, invoking the consultative Declaration of the  13th July  last, suggested that the Ministers ofGreat Britain, Germany, Italy and France should meet on the 11th  instant atLondon in order to exchange views  regarding the  means of overcoming thedifficulties caused by this situation.    In reply to  this communication the  French Government has  the honour tostate  that  it  is not  unfavourable  to  conversations  between-een  Powers,  inaccordance with the procedure proposed  by His Majesty&apos;s Government, similarto those which yielded such happy results in June and July.    As these conversations can only be of a semi-official and preliminary nature,however, the French Government requests that they should  take place at Genevawithin the framework of the League of Nations, which is alone entitled to takefinal decisions, with the collaboration of all parties concerned.    Paris, October 6, 1932.
