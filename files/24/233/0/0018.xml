is document is  the  property  of His Britannic M.ajesty&apos;s Government.RET .                     CABINET.               Copy No...319 (32 )                   POLICE PAY .                 Kemorgndurn hy the Home Secret rry^        It  is necessary that I should  make a brief reply to the Note   by  Sir Warren Fisher which hps been circulated by the Chancellor   of  the Exchequer.  I shall not repeat any of the arguments put   forward  in my two previous papers,  none of which are impaired by   bir Warren Fisher&apos;s Note.        1.   It is not the case that the Secretary of State for   Scotland and I propose any &quot;relaxation in favour of the police&quot;,   or  making any &quot;concession&quot; which would.be inconsistent with further   economies.  We propose simply that  no departure should be made   from the course  announced by the Government a year ago.        2.   Sir Warren Fisher troes so  far as to say (par.6) that &quot;the   Home Secretary and the Scottish Secretary  .... feel absolved from   the necessity of having any regard  to considerations of merits,   equity or national interests&quot;.  I will not stay to comment upon the   tone of  this paragraph or upon that of- paragraph 12.  I would only   make two observations:- first, that the Kay Committee proposed,  on   the merits of the case, a. 20 per cent, cut for teachers and a 12-/; p   cent,  cut for police, and that the  first proposals of the   (Government were  for a 15  per cent,  cut for teachers and a 12-1 per   cent,  cut for police - precisely the same margin of difference as   we  ere proposing now;  second, that the repudiation of a pledge   publicly given by the Government to an important public service,   should hardly be considered to be in the national interests.        3.   It is to be noted that Sir barren Fisher states in par .8   that the Treasury revised the draft of the White Paper, then about   to  be  presented to Parliament, in order to render it consistent   with the statement, which I had made to the Police Council, that   future economies would be taken into account in determining the   second instalment of the cut.
     4.  If the Prime Minister&apos;s announcement in Parliament onSeptember 21st, 1931, was intended to meen thet the police endteachers and members of the Defence Services, other than the 15,000referred to, were to be cut 10 per cent., not more end not less,why -as it not so worded?  If it had been proposed to make it inthat form I should have demurred, es it would have been contrary tothe pledges I had given.     5.  That announcement WES not, es stated in paragraph 10, &quot;an unqualified pledge embodying the principle of equal sacrifice&quot;.As a matter of fact the Scottish teachers, whose remuneration is fixed in a different way from thet of the English teachers, have been subjected to a cut during the last twelve months averaging aboutmutiny in the fleet on that account.     6.  It is difficult to see how the Prime Minister&apos;s statement in the House of Commons on oeptember 21st that the police were to be cut &quot;not more than 10 per cent.&quot; can be taken to over-ride my statement, made also in the House of Commons and in his presencefour days later, that the necessary savings, instead of fallingwholly upon the pay of the police, should be effected as far aspossible by administrative economies.  No objection was taken atthe time by him, or by any of our colleagues, or by the Treesury,publicly or privately, to me or to the Secretary of Stete forScotland, with respect to any of these assurances given by us.     7,  It is true that no revised white Paper was issued as a consequence of the general reduction of the cuts, but on October12th, 1931, the Treasury itself sent to the Prime Minister for his information a statement of the amount anticipated from the policeeconomies revised as a result of the alteration in the cut from12-g- per cent, to 10 per cent.  This reives a figure of  1,750,000in piece of the previous figure of  2,000,000.  / copy was sent atthe seme time by the Treesury to the Home Office; it is now in ourfiles, and we have been working on that figure ever since.   Acorresponding reduction was made in the estimate of the savings on8 per centnot 10; many of them less.
1452f;.th September, 1932.the  education Votes in consequence of the reduction in the terchers&apos;cut from 15 per cent, to 10 per cent.     8.  In referring to my offer to submit a revised scheme to theCabinet Committee  (per .13) Sir Werren Fisher does not inform theCabinet that one of the conditions of that offer was &quot;the savings from &apos;c administrative economies to inure for the benefit of thepolice in some form or other&quot;.  He ought not to have omitted thatproviso from his quotation from the minutes of the Committee, for                 &quot;it is obviously of the essence of the matter.  At the conclusion ofthat meeting the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he acceptedmy offer, but that &quot;all would agree that the- scheme must meet the criticisms which had been  advanced against the proposals in            -C.P.94(32) and must not give away with one hand what was received with the other&quot;.   I had thought it might be possible to devisesome method of saving the appearance of the 10 per cent, cut whilefulfilling the substance of the pledge given to the police that thebenefit of the specifl economies should accrue to them.  On goingmore closely into the matter it was found impossible to devise anysuch scheme, and doubly impossible to devise one while conformingto the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s condition, which was rerllyincompftible with the purpose I had in view.  As already explained,the delay that occurred cfter that was due to the time necessarilytaken by the Departments in collecting and analysing the localfigures^ aft  ijadispensevble pi*e] iminai-y to the presentation of any definite proposel.                                                 *&apos;                                   H.
