Reference  may be made  in the course  of debate  to the     surtaxes,  &quot;dumping&quot;  duties,  and other such provisions     which had  tbeen superimposed on the normal tariffs  of the     Dominions  to the detriment  of United Kingdom trade.   I     have  therefore  had the attached note prepared,  which show     the  extent to which undertakings were obtained  at Ottawa     that  such  provisions would  be removed or  modified.                                               W.R.Board of  Trade,   19th October,  1932.
                        \                       OTTAWA AGREEMENTS.    Provisions relating  to surtaxes, &quot;dumping&quot; duties,  etc.  .     The following note  deals with  surtaxes,  &quot;dumping&quot;  duties,ond other such provisions which have been superimposed  on thenormal tariffs of the Dominions to  the detriment of UnitedKingdom export trade, end shows tlxe extent to whichundertakings were obtained at Ottawa that such provisions would be  removed or modified.                            CANADA.     The principal onuses of compliant have been:-   (l) Exchange dumping duty.   This duty is charged on goods of a class or kind made in Canada and imported from the UnitedKingdom.   In the case of goods entitled to entry under the preferential tariff the duty is the difference between ^4.40and the current rate of exchange,  i.e., about 16fj ad valoremwith the Canadian exchange at 03,80 =       In the cpse ofgoods not entitled to entry under the preferential tnriff(about one-quarter of the imports from the United Kingdom) theduty is the full difference between the p-?.r rr^te of exchange&quot;nd the current r^:te, i.e. obout 26  ^d v.olorem with theCnnrdi^n exchcnge at  f3.80 to the     By Article IV the Con-dinn Government undertook &quot;to  givesympathetic consideration to the possibilitj&apos;- of reducing  -r-ndultimately abolishing the exchange dumping duty in so fp.r  r-.sit npplies to imports from the United Kingdom&quot;.   It isunderstood that the question 1B under consideration, but weare informed that no decision h.&apos;.?s yet been reached.   (2) Exchange and valuation for ordinary duty.   Ordinaryduty on all imports into Canada from the United Kingdom is assessed at the par rate of exchonge instead of the current rate.   This means that the amount of the,duty is rt the
present time about 26% higher than it would be if assessmenttook place at the current rate of exchange.     No specific undertaking was obtained to remedy thisgrievance, but the point may be held to be covered by theundertaking &quot;that all existing surcharges on imports from theUnited Kingdom shall bo completely abolished as soon as the finances of CanRdn will allow&quot;.     A note was sent to the Prime Minister of Canada on the19th August in connection with Article 17 of the Agreementsummarising the views which had been expressed to theCanadian Government on the subject of the exchange dumpingduty and the par valuation of goods for customs duty purposes.It is hoped to obtain some relief on the latter points   (3) Ordinary dumping duty.   This applies to all goods ofa class or kind made in Canada wherever the Customs Authoritiesare satisfied that the export price is below &quot;the value forcustoms duty purposes&quot;.   &quot;The value for customs duty purposes&apos;is normally the current domestic value in the country cfexport, but under Section 43 of the Customs Act it may be anentirely arbitrary value.   -Arbitrary valuation underSection 43 is used not only for dumping duty but also inconnection with ordinary customs duty.     During the course of the Conference an undertaking was obtained from the Government of Canada that they would soamend Section 43 of the Customs Act &quot;as to provide that the .operations of the Section shall not apply to goods which areentitled to entry under the British preferential tariff orany lower tariff&quot;.   This undertaking must for the time beingbe regarded as confidential and cannot be publicly referredto, but legislation to deal with the point is expected to beintroduced this week,   (4) Uncertainty and lack of provision for appeal.   Thecomplication of the Canadian tariff, and in particular the
liability to arbitrary valuation under Section 43, has donemuch to obstruct trpde by creating uncertainty as to the amountof duty, and a further grievance has lain in the fact that inall these matters the Customs Authorities s.re the sole and final arbiters.     By Article 16 of the Agreement the Canadian government undertook &quot;that Customs administration in Canada shall be governed by such general principles as will ensure (a) the avoidance, so far as is reasonably possible, of uncertainty asto the amount of customs duty or other fiscal impost payable on entry into Canada;  (b) the reduction of delay and frictionto a minimum;  and (c) the provision of machinery for the prompt and impartial settlement of disputes in mattersappertaining to the application of tariffs&quot;.                          AUSTRALIA.     During the period of crisis in Australia the ScullinGovernment,  in addition to increasing the height of thetariff, adopted the following measures        (1)  The import of certain goods was prohibited     (subject In some cases to provision for import under     licence).        (2)  A surtax of 50 per cent, of the amount of duty     payable under the Tariff was imposed on a fairly wide     range of goods.        (3)  A &quot;primage&quot; duty was imposed on all imports,  at&apos;     first at 2^ per cent., subsequently increased to 4 per     cent, and later, with certain exceptions, to 10 per cent.     ad valorem.     In February and again in May last certain of theprohibitions were removed, and the 50 per cent, surtax wastaken off a  few articles,  and in this respect the position hadnlreody been epsed before the Conference began.,
     By Article 14 of the Agreement the Australian government undertook, in regard to United Kingdom goods, to remove &quot;assoon as practicable&quot; the remaining prohibitions and surcharges,and &quot;to reduce or remove primage duty as soon as the finances of Australia will allow&quot;.     As regards prohibitions and surcharges these undertakingswere carried out on the 3lst August last.   The estimated valueof the trade affected in the year 1928-29 (before theprohibitions and surtaxes were in force) was asfollows:-                                              Of which, from                             Total Imports.   United Kingdom.                                  *000             &apos;000     Affected by prohibitions.   2,589            1,228     Affected by surtax ......   3,900            2,025     The goods affected include wireless sets ana apparatus;sanitary earthenware;  iron and steel beams;  channels,girders, etc.;  apparel;  leather manufactures;  advertisingmatter.     On September 2nd,  35 classes of goods were exempted fromprimage duty, including barbed wire and wire netting;  farmtractors and other agricultural machinery;  mining machinery;and certain classes of iron and steel plates and sheets.                          NEW ZEALAND.     In addition to the ordinary tariff, goods entering NewZealand pay the following charges        (a) if subject to customs duty,  o surtax of 9/40ths     (in a few cases ^-/SOth) of the duty payable;        (b) if not subject to customs duty,  a primage duty     of 3 per cent, ad valorem.     The New Zealand Government undertook (a)  to inviteParliament to pass legislation exempting United Kingdom goods from the surtax (Article 6);  (b)  not to increase,  and to abolish as soon 9s financial conditions  permit,  the primage
duty of 3 per cent, on United Kingdom goods.   The formerundertaking has been carried out.                        SOUTH AFRICA.     South Africa, like Canada, levies an &quot;exchange&quot; dumpingduty on United Kingdom goods, the duty being the differencebetween the f.o^b. value of the goods converted at 18s. S.A. s 1 sterling and that converted at the current rate of exchange(i.e. about l4/5d. S,A, = -fil),   Thus at the present rate theduty is about 20 per cent.   The range of goods on which theduty is levied is much narrower than in the case of Canada,and has not aroused the same volume of complaint.     No undertaking was obtained in regard to this,,     South Africa has also imposed a primage duty of 5 percent, ad valorem (November, 1931)  and a surtax of 7^ per cent,ad valorem (March, 1932), which apply to all imports with few exceptions.   These duties wore imposed to meet the rsvenueand trnde difficulties resulting from the maintenance of theSouth Africa exchange when so many other countries went offgold.   No undertaking was obtained as to the removal of these charges.                         NEWFOUNDLAND,     Newfoundland, like Canada, values imports from the UnitedKingdom at the par rate of exchange for the purpose of customsduties.   An undertaking was obtained that,  in connection witha general revision of the tariff to be undertaken in July,1933, legislation would be promoted incorporating &quot;provisionfor new and more favourable conditions in regard to the valuation of the pound sterling for customs purposes&quot;.            It was not necessary to raise such matters with  India  or       Southern Rhodesia. r-d of Trade,119th October,  1932.
