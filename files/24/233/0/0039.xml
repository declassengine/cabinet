Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,          In accordance with Cabinet  48(32), conclusion(a), I circulate herewith a note by  the Treasuryexamining in detail the proposed administrative  economies in the Police Services.C RET,341(52).CAB I N E T.POLICE PAY.(Intld.)  N.C.easury Chambers,10th October, 1932.
cs t** j-t6 JOPOLICE.     The Police economies for a full year were stated in theWhite Paper issued on 10th September 1931 at  2,000,000.    the reductions in pay already made are estimated to amount to  832,555for a full year.   In addition the Home Office and Scottish Officeestimate that administrative economies amounting to  433,579  willbe made in the financial year 1932/3, making a total of  1,266,134and leaving a shortage of  734,000 on the total economies required.The Treasury have been instructed to examine the economies proposedby the Home and Scottish Offices in detail distinguishing betweenmeasures of continuing economy and temporary economies.     The total net saving for the full year 1932/53 by thePolice Authorities in England and Wales as at present estimated is 409,560 out of the total administrative saving of  453,579 forGreat 3ritain.   It is made uo as follows :-                                                                   1.  Police strength              121,040               2.  Clothing                      89,860               3.  Travelling                     9,940               4.  Buildings, purchase and)                    improvements charged  )     131,720                    t o revenue            )                    Loan charges                  8,200                    Repairs                      30,780                    Rents and Rent                      allowances                  1,400               5,  Printing, telephones, etc.     2,760               6.  Other expenses                13,860                                                409,560     This does not represent the full savings in expenditure but only that which can be regarded as a consequence of theemergency measures.   On the other hand there are normalincreases of expenditure which more than offset the normalsavings.   The figures furnished by the Home Office show that apart from the pay cuts and other emergency economies the net
I        estimated expenditure  for  1932/3 exceeds  the estimated         expenditure  prior  to the issue  of  the White Paper by about          200,000  (represented  largely by increased pension payments)/              1.   Police  Strength,  Of the   121,040 about  55,000         is  due  to proposals not  to fill vacancies in the Police Force         occurring after  1st October, 1931, i.e. a reduction in         police  strength  existing at  that date.   This sum may be         regarded  as  representing savings of a continuing character         on  the  basis of  expenditure  prior  to the issue of the White         Paper of  10th September, 1931.   About  59,000 is in respect         of  the  suspension  of an  increase in the Police Force in         London.    Although this  sum  is  a reduction of expenditure         authorised before  the  Issue  cf  the White Paper, it cannot be         regarded  as  an economy on  pre-White Paper expenditure.              2.   Clothing.  The  estimated  saving  in clothing         represents partly  a mere postponement of  expenditure and         partly  a  continuing  saving due  to  a longer period of the         7,-ear of existing and new clothing  issued  to the police and         to  the  reduction in police strength referred to above.  Any         estimate  of  this continuing  saving would be purely         conjectural, but it is improbable  that it would amount to          50,000.              3.   Travelling,   This item  is  largely made up of deferred         purchases of new vehicles.   It  is  doubtful whether much         lasting economy  will be  secured by the action which has         been taken and it  would  be reasonable to  assume that the         bulk of the  economy  is for a year  or two  only.              4.   Buildings. The  deferment  of purchases and         improvements does  not  in the main  represent a continuing         economy.    In some cases there  is  an actual saving for  one         year only.   In  other  cases  no  ultimate  saving would be         secured as the postponed expenditure may be incurred in a         later year.    It is understood  however that in a few cases                                    -2-
the authorities may adopt as a continuing policy a reducedprogramme of purchase and construction of new  buildings, andin these a continuing economy would be secured.     The  itemfor repairs for the most part represents a postponement ofwork and may be an ultimate saving for one year.    In a few cases it may be proposed to undertake repairs  of premises atlonger intervals than at present and thereby to  secure  asmall continuing saving.     6.   Other expenses.   This item is made  up of a largenumber of miscellaneous savings of day to day  expenditure and a large part of it probably represents a permanenteconomy.          It is difficult to regard even as much as one half of the economies as of a strictly continuing character.It is, however, only fair to add that the Home Office pointout that the economies are contributed by not less than 180separate authorities and that, although a particular savingmay not recur in a particular police district, its place maybe taken by other economies in other districts.    Tney  suggestthat on balance the aggregate may well be maintained over aperiod of years.   They also point out that the savings are calculated by reference to the financial year ending 31st -                     -March 1933 and that most of the measures producing savingsunder the head of police strength take effect gradually.The savings under this head will he higher in the year October1932 to October 1933 than in the financial year 1932/3.
