147OONFIDENTIAL.                                                 A.0.245.                       BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL.                        STATE OP TRADE - AUGUST 1932*            Summary  of Reports made to the Board of Trade Advisory         Council In  oonriectiorTwith their meeting on September fl n,         1952  (supplemented In 3ome cases with information from         other  sources).            Employment  -  To a large extent the dispute in the cotton       industry aocounted for a decline in employment in August.       Other industries which showed declines were:-  textile printing,       bleaching, etc., tailoring, coal-mining, dock and harbour       services and  the distributive trades.   The number of persons       unemployed as shown on the registers of Employment Exchanges       in Great Britain was nearly 2,860,000 at the end of the month.       Compared with the previous us month the number wholly unemployed,       including oasuals, rose by 50,303, while the number temporarily       stopped  fell  by 2,257, a net increase of 48,046.  There was an       increase of nearly 38,000 in the North Western Division;       increases were also shown in Wales and in the Midlands and       North Eastern Divisions.    In Scotland unemployment decreased by       nearly 10,500, the jute industry showing an improvement, but       this was mainly due to the fact that the figures for this       Industry for  July were affected by extended holiday stoppages.            Overseas Trade   -  Each of the three principal olasses of       goods imported into the United Kingdom showed a decrease in       August compared with the corresponding month of last year, the       largest  decrease being in manufactured goods, which declined by        7 million or 35.1 per cent.  Exports of United Kingdom       manufactured  goods amounted to  21,653,000 or  313,000  less       than  in  August, 1931.            Rail and Road Traffic  -  The deoline in  railway traffic       receipts continued in August.   Compared with the corresponding       periods  of 1931 the rates of decline in passenger traffic
                                                                 m     reoelpts for the  last  two weeks  of  August  and for  the     34 weeks ended 28th August were  4.50^ and  7.31^ respectively.     Receipts from ooal, ooke  and patent fuel traffic have  decreased     by 6.85  per  oent.  and  from other freight traffic by  12.20 per     cent;  during the  same  period of  34  weeks.   For the  first six     months of 1932 the statistics of passengers  (excluding season     ticket holders) conveyed  over all standard gauge railways in     Great  Britain, except  the London Tube and  Metropolitan Distriot     Railways, show that compare-d with the corresponding  period  of     1931 the number of journeys taken deoreased by 3.2 per cent.;     the Journeys taken at  reduced fares,  except workmen^,     increased by over  2 million (or  1 per oent.)  whilst  journeys     taken  at other fares,  including  workmen1 s,decreased  by     15 million.         The number of new registrations  during July of  motor     oyoles and of other motor vehicles  show decreases  of 1,138     (or 15.5 per cent.) and 1,439 (or 7.4 per  cent.),  respectively,     compared with July 1931.         Ooal-minlng.  - The  average number of persons employed in     the industry for  the 13 weeks ended 20th August was  795,500     compared with 835,300  for the corresponding period of  1931.     The average  weekly output in the same period  of 1932 was     3,713,000 tons - which was 2.4 per  cent, less than in  the      corresponding period  of  1931.  In the *seven months  ended July,     1932,  oompared with the corresponding period  of 1931 the exports     of ooal  deoreased  by 1,661,000 tons,  and the  coal  sent for     bunkering purposes increased by  85,000 tons.    There  were     inoreaaes in exports aggregating 578,000 tons during the same     period of 1932 from minor ports  on  the East Ooast  of England,     other  than Humber  and  North East Ooast Ports, and  on the East     and West Ooasta of Scotland, but there were decreases  in      shipments from other  portB,the  eight months  ended  August  1932 oompared with the corresponding  period of  1931 the decrease in exports  was nearly 1,706,000 tons  and the  increase in  ooal sent for  bunkering  purposes was 39,000 tons.
                                                         H9       SB....SQ^sl&apos;?Ji&quot;  Compared with August, 1931, theproduction of pig iron in August decreased hy 16,000 tens andthat of steel ingots increased by 4,000 tons.  Comparing thesame periods, the imports of iron and steel and manufacturesthereof decreased by nearly 97,000 tori3, whilst the exportsincreased by 12,000 tons.     There was  an appreciable rise in the export prices of continental Iron and steel products;  the improvement was generaland was attributed mainly to the report of a pending agreementbetween the Belgian steel producers which would considerablyimprove the outlook for the re-organisation of the Internationalsteel cartel.     The tone of the United Kingdom iron and steel market was stated to have  improved during recent weeks;  the amount of new business actually transacted was not large but the volume ofeaoj.iry9 particularly for export., increased.   Continentalmaterial, semi-finished and finished, was still offered atconsiderably lower prices than the home product, but owing tothe recent advances abroad the gaps between the foreign and home prices were reduced by a few shillings per ton..      Shipping  and Shipbuilding  -  There was little change inthe general position.  The freight index figure, which was 73 in June, fell further in July, but in August it advanced to 74.86.In comparing the current figures with those of a year agoallowance must  be made for the departure of this country fromthe Gold Standard..     Apart from the coal market, whioh continued to be one ofgreat difficulty, outward business for general cargoes showedslight signs of improvement.   It was estimated that 1aid-uptonnage throughout the world amounted to over 14 millions great &amp;stons, of whioh  over 3-1 millions gross tons were in the UnitedKingdom.   Shipbuilding was practically at a standstill.                            -3-
     Machine Tools  -  During July out of a total export of 324,000,, about 87 per cent, were shipped to Russia. Otherorders for Russia were being completed, but oredit insurancedifficulties were stated to be an obstacle to the acceptance ofnew business.     There was concern In the trade in regard to the possible repercussions which a policy of discriminating against Russianimports may have upon this branch of British industry.     Electrical Industry  -  The industry cciitimied to operate at the sare level as In July, that is, sli^tly below 50 peroent. of oapacity.   Taking 1920 as the datum line the index ofhome order3 received for heavy plant  (mainly owing to a largeoontra^t placed by the Brighton Corporation) advanced from 52 inJuly to 56 in August, and although exports receded from 72 inJuly to 68 in August the index of home and expert business taken together rose from 52 in July to 54- in August..  In the case of light apparatus the situation was more encouragingj  the radioseotion in particular was doing well,.  For the seven month sending in July the consumption of electricity compared with the corresponding period of 1931 increased by 7^3 per oento     Motor Industry  -  In the home trade general conditionsremained practically unchanged.   A few factories, which have announced their programmes for 1933 (particularly those producingoars up to 12 h.p.) were maintaining full time employment, theremainder were engaged in preparatory work for the production of193* models.   The oemmercial vehicle industry was quiet;  thehome registration of goods-carrying vehicles showed littlevariation, but the Salter report has created a somewhat uneasyfeeling.   Exports of cars in the smaller bjjr3e-power categoriescontinued on a fairly satisfactory level and registrations over recent periods in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa,although small, indicated that the percentage of British carsin relation to total imports was gradually increasing.                             -4-
                                                     151     Cotton - The dispute in the weaving section overshadowedall other aspects of the cotton industry,  and the spinning andweaving sections of the trade were rapidly being brought  to a standstill.   A more accessible market for Lancashire cotton piece goods has been provided in India owing to the increasedimport duties which wore imposed towards the end of August onpiece goods of non-British origin.     Wool - The advance in wool prices which coincided with theopening of the new Australian Season prompted a further rise inBradford with the result that fine tops in August were quoted at3d, per lb. above the lowest price in June.   Yarns did not benefit to the same extent as tops and spinners y/ere only ableto pass on a part of the advance to their customers.   Theoutlook in the manufacturing branch was &quot;better but the improvementhas, as yet, not resulted in increased machinery activity.  Insome quarters it was suggested that the rise in the values ofraw materials was too rapid to be sustained3 but the trade generally was stated to be operating with confidence in the belief that the recent lowest prices would not again he experienced.     High tariffs continued to hamper export trade;  the  newtariff in Germany, in particular, made sales more difficult in  &quot;a promising market.     Silk and Artificial Silk - The price of best grade raw silkhas nearly doubled during the last two months, but this advancemade it difficult to transact new business;  the demand forthrown silk was fairly well maintained;  most of the works ofthe spun silk spinners were running at less than one-halfcapacity.   The production of artificial silk yarn decreasedduring July and August but it was substantially larger than ayear ago.   According to a report from the German artificial silk Syndicate it has been decided to grant a bonus to German
exporters of artificial silk to enable them to  compete withforeign manufacturers who were alleged to be selling their products on the world market at prices below the Gorman export prices.     Other Industries - Although the usual holiday period wasunduly prolonged the general demand for chomAcals daring Augustcontinued on a level superior to that of August 1931-    foreing markets for dyestuffs were until recently not greatly affectedby the world depression but in August there was a marked decreasein deliveries.    Although trade remained quiet in the boot andshoe industry there was a more optimistic note in the reports from some of the principal districts (e.g, Leicester,  Ketteringand Norwich).    In a few cases there was stated to be a fairlyregular inflow of small orders5   production in July 1932 was  ona somewhat higher scale than in July 1951.   The demands frommotor car and motor cycle manufacturers for rubber tyres were better than last year;  the re-placement market showed a decreaseof from 5 to 10 per cents   Owing to  the fine weather there  was alarge home demand for rubber soled sportn shoos:  the bulk ofthis demand was met by Japanese.goods which, it was stated,  were offered at prices fully 50$ below the cheapest British goods.     The Wheat Situation - Owing to the. smell winter wheat cropin the United States of America the exports from that country during 1932-3 are likely to be from the accumulated surplus  and&quot;carry over&apos;1 of previous crops.   The crop in Canada was estimatedat 450 million bushels, a great improvement on the yield of  1931;this crop, with the surplus from prevLous crops, provides a  large quantity available for export.   At present the world price  is largely governed by C&amp;aicda and the United States of America.Two-thirds of world shipments of wheat  during the first three  week of the present crop year have been from North America but the
                                                      11) 3shipments,  so far,  have amounted to  less  than  one half  of  the total shipped during the first  three  weeks  of the previous crop year.    During the latter  period Russia  exported 12,000,000 &quot;bushelsj  there have &quot;been  no  shipments from that country during the corresponding period  of  this year.      There has been a sudden fall in  the price of wheat  in Prance due to the  heavy harvest and increased production brought about by the protective measures of the French Government;  efforts are being  made by the  French Ministry of Agriculture to persuade fermers (with financial sssistance) to stock their whe^t  and sell by instalments.      Retail Trade  - Compared with a year ago  the money value of sales in July decreased by 6.3  per  cent; for the six  months ended in July the  decrease was  4.8  per cent,  compared  with the corresponding period of 1931.   The value of  stocks (at  cost) at the end of July was 3.3 per  cent,  lower  than in July  1931. The trade  of the Co-operative wholesale  Society showed an increase of 1.9 per cent, for the four weeks  ended 6th August compared with the  corresponding period of 1931,      Finance - In  many directions the success of  the  conversion operation was regarded as a contributory factor to the more hopeful feeling which was evident in  the principal financial centres.   Other events which have  had favourable effects were the agreements concluded at Ottawa, the  improved  internal position in Denmark, (which has  enabled exchange control  to be relaxed) and  the  prospect of a balanced budget in Australia. Deposits in cle ring b-.nks totalled  1,850  million in  August -  47 million more than in July,  end   192  million more  than in February lust.   The average rate at  which  Treasury Bills were allotted in February was  4.1.7 per cent.;   in August  the average rate wos 12s. Id. per cent.    Applications for bank advances for current trading purposes were  very limited  in their amount.
     In New York there was a revival of confidence;   commonstocks practically doubled in value.   The gold holding of  thefederal Reserve Bank increased &quot;by $130 million since the endof July.   The monetary situation improved end no  anxiety was shown regarding the Treasury deficit.     In Germany, in order to prevent a complete collapse of  thefinancial structure the Government have taken control of various sections of industry and, excluding the State railways,  it was estimated that the Reich and the States control enterprisesvalued at Rm.12,000 million.     Australian Trade - Total Imports xnd Exports  (in australian currency) in July amounted to  5,803,000  and 5,560,000, respectively, compared with  4,069,000 and 7,118,000, respectively, in July 1931.   Exports  of flour  fromthe beginning of the season to the end of August amounted to461,348 tons coiapared with 390,514 tons for the correspondingperiod of last season;  from the 1st December to the end ofAugust exports of wheat amounted to 106,415,000 bushels comparedwith 120,155,000 bushels for the corresponding period of 1931.     Customs Revenue for July snd August amounted  to  5,535,000 -an  increase of  900,000 compared with the corresponding monthsof 1931.     The new wool selling season opened in Sydney  at the end ofAugust with prices which were from 15 to 20 per cent, above those prevailing in June.     Canadian Trade - Generally speaking production  in July  was ata lower level than in June.   Imports in July amounted to$35,711,000  compared with $40,743,000 in June.    Exportsincreased from $41,701,000 in June to $43,032,000  in July.
