Printed for the &quot;Cabinet.  September 1932.CONFIDENTIAL.                                       Copy No.  5QCP. 305 (32).    This Paper 305  (32) is in substitution of Paper CP. 304 (32) in which thereis the omission of a  paragraph.    Paper CP. 304 (32) should be destroyed.      MEMORANDUM BY  THE  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR                          FOREIGN AFFAIRS.    AT the Disarmament Conference a very critical situation lies immediately ahead.  Germany, in her memorandum of trie 29th August, insists on her claimto &quot;equality of status,&quot; and repeats the declaration that she will not co-operatefurther in the  work of the Conference until this  claim  is recognised.  It isimpossible for Germany to go back on this declaration, and Count Bernstorff has informed me within the last day or two that Germany&apos;s representative  will beabsent from Geneva.    2.  The French memorandum in reply does not, in terms, deny the Germanthesis; it evades it.  Germany has informed me officially that she regards the reply as unsatisfactory, and considers that the method of bilateral and confidentialconference with France has failed.  Signor  Mussolini has  announced that Italyconsiders that Germany has right on her side, but urges that adjustment must come gradually.    3.  The questions that now arise are, what is the position to be taken up bythis country ?  When and how should that position be  made public ?   How can the Bureau  of the  Conference  (which meets  on the 21st  September) carry onwithout Germany ?  How can the Disarmament Conference be rescued from thefailure which threatens it ?  And what is likely to be the result of failure tocompose these differences ?    4.  As regards British policy, I take the view that it will be impossible to abstain from any declaration.   We have successfully avoided the  risk of beingassociated with the  French note and have kept our hands free.  This gives us allthe more authority  in anything we  may now say.  But we shall not be  able toavoid making a statement and we ought to do so. We have to consider its effect,not only on France  and on Germany, but on America, and of course we have toconsider our own people and the Dominions.    5.  As regards France, the central fact appears to me to be that germany will not accept a denial of her claim and, if all adjustment is refused her, is very likely to take things into her own hands in disregard of the Treaty of  Versailles:The  choice therefore is between  an agreement  with Germany for a modifiedregime for the next five or ten years, and a disregard by Germany of the strictconditions of Part V of the Treaty without any agreement for their modification.No third course, such as that Germany should be held to  the Treaty and &quot;not allowed any variation of it,&quot; appears to me  to be practicable.    6.  As regards Germany, her real  concern is &apos;&apos; status.&quot;  If a way could befound of removing this grievance, it seems improbable that Germany would seek to increase her armaments materially for one thing she could not afford it.  Butthe German people have come to feel that there is a humiliation attached to theirpresent position, and they want to get rid of Part V of the Treaty of  Versailles,even if they bind themselves to corresponding terms in the new Convention.  we ought, I think, to do everything we can to meet Germany&apos;s grievance, so far as ittells on status, while insisting that there can be no unilateral disregard of treaties and no rearming.       6543  [7592]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
2    7.  As regards the United States, it seems to me that American opinion wouldbe likely to approve  a  British declaration which insisted  on the sanctity of treaties, on the necessity that they should only be modified by agreement, and onthe impossibility of countenancing rearmament, while at the same time it sought to remove the feeling of inequality of status.  The importance of finding a solutionof the difficulty in order to  give every encouragement to the economic recovery of the world should be prominent in our document.    8.  All this falls short of the real solution,  which would  be to agree atGeneva to the general abolition of  arms which Germany, under the Treaty ofVersailles, is not allowed to have.   That would produce equality of status and disarment at a blow.   Short of this, Germany will always be able to say thather claim for equality of status involves the possession by her of some specimens,at any rate, of arms which other nations have.  Even if she had a very limited number of them, they would be types from  which she might subsequently evolvemass  production.   There is really no way of getting over these difficulties except by much more  considerable measures of disarmament  than many  authorities and departments will contemplate.    9.  It is intended to make public on Monday morning the statement enclosedas to the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom on the recentexchange of notes between the German and  French Governments.                                                                    J. S.    September 15, 1932.
ENCLOSURE.Statement of  Views of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom on    Questions arising out of Notes exchanged between the German Government    (August 29) and the French Government (September 11) regarding the Work    of the Disarmament Conference.    THE exchange of notes which has recently taken place between the Germanand French  Governments on the subject of &quot;equality of status&quot; in the matterof disarmament, and the announcement made by the German delegate at Genevathat his Government  regarded this  question as necessary to be  dealt  withforthwith if their collaboration in the work of the Disarmament Conference wasto continue, involve matters of the greatest importance for the future  progressof the  conference,  and, indeed,  for  the future of  disarmament  itself.   HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the whole British people are most deeply concerned topromote the success of the conference, and hold that international agreement (towhich, of course, Germany must be a party) for the limitation  and reduction ofarmaments would not only relieve  the  world from the burden of expense whichis retarding its economic  recovery,  but  would  be an  immediate and  solidcontribution towards the&apos; preservation of world peace  and the promotion of goodfeeling  between neighbouring States.   With  a profound sense  of their duty topromote appeasement and to search for reconciliation of different points of view,His Majesty&apos;s  Government deem it well to make the following observations :     2.  His Majesty&apos;s Government feel  constrained to state at the  outset thatthey think it unfortunate that a political controversy of this magnitude should arise at this moment, when  it is so necessary that attention  and energy shouldnot be diverted from efforts which are being undertaken, and are so  urgently needed, to restore  the  productive and commercial  prosperity of  the world.Granted that this question  of equality of status would have arisen before theDisarmament Conference concluded its  work, there is grave  disadvantage in forcing it to the front at this stage. Germany has suffered  and  is suffering fromthe prevailing  economic depression,  and widespread unemployment,  and theother signatories of the Treaty of Versailles have recognised this, and have shown themselves ready in consequence to abate, and, indeed, fundamentally  to revise,their financial claims upon Germany. In view of Germany&apos;s economic difficulties,the initiation of acute controversy in  the political field at  this  moment must be accounted unwise.  And, in  view of the concessions so recently  granted toGermany by her creditors,  it  must be  accounted particularly untimely.   HisMajesty&apos;s Government most  earnestly hope that nothing may be now allowed to intervene which  would  retard the process  of economic recovery, which  is sourgently necessary, and which it  will be the  task of the approaching world economic Conference to promote by every means in its power.    3.  But, as Germany&apos;s claim to a status of equality has been put prominentlyforward, and  threatens to impose  an obstacle to the smooth  and harmoniousworking of the conference, His Majesty&apos;s Government consider  that they should offer some comments on the subject and make some  suggestions as to  how theclaim might be  dealt with.  First, it is necessary to be clear as to what the claiminvolves and as to the actual treaty position.  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government can give no countenance or encouragement to  the disregard of  treaty obligations.-Although His  Majesty&apos;s  Government do  rfot  understand  the   Germanmemorandum to have stated a contrary view, they desire to associate themselves with the opinion that it could not be maintained as the correct legal constructionof the Treaty of Versailles  and the connected  correspondence  that Germany islegally entitled to the abrogation of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles by anyDisarmament Convention to be concluded, or by failure to conclude any convention at all.  If the preamble  to Part V of the  Treaty of Versailles is looked  at it willbe seen that the allied Powers, in requiring  these  limitations on  Germany&apos;sarmaments, had in mind the object or reason therein  indicated. That  object orreason was to  &apos;: render possible the initiation of a  general limitation of the armaments of all nations.&quot;  To state what the object or aim of a stipulation is isa very different thing from  making the  successful fulfilment of that object thecondition of the stipulation.  Still less is it  possible to deduce as a matter of legal  interpretation of  the  treaty  that  -the manner  in which the object the
general limitation of armaments was to be fulfilled was to be precisely the sameas the manner in which Germany&apos;s armaments had been limited by Part V, forthe only  indication in the treaty of the manner in which general disarmamentis to be brought about is to be found in the very general words of article 8 of theCovenant.  The correct position under the Treaty of &quot;Versailles is that Part V isstill binding, and can only cease to be binding by agreement.     4.  So much has been stated for the  purpose of clearing the ground.  but his Majesty&apos;s  Government  do not  understand  that  the  case  put forward byGermany is a legalistic deduction from the language of the Treaty of Versailles.It is rather an appeal for adjustment based on the fact that the limitation ofGermany&apos;s armaments contained in the treaty was intended to be, and announced to be, the precursor of general limitation by others.  His Majesty&apos;s government do not deny the fact, and do not seek to minimise the force of the contention.  Sofar  as the  Government of  the  United  Kingdom are  concerned,  very largereductions in all departments of armaments have been made since the Treaty ofVersailles was signed.  Nevertheless, the  United Kingdom  Government  areearnestly collaborating at Geneva in promoting, to the utmost of their power,measures of further disarmament, both in  the qualitative and quantitative sense,which would all tend in the direction of greater equalisation.     5.  It is the hope of the  United Kingdom Government that there may result from Geneva, in spite of the  difficulties that have been encountered and that are inherent  in the effort to reach world-wide agreement, a really valuable measure of disarmament in which each  nation will bind itself to a strict limitation,  bothin the kinds and in the quantities of its weapons of war.   Such a result can be&apos;attained  only if due allowance is made both for the needs and for the feelings ofall  the sixty-four States concerned.   The objects to be aimed at are, in the caseof the more heavily armed Powers, the largest possible reduction, and^ in the caseof lightly armed States, at any rate no material  increase.  It would indeed be atragic paradox if the outcome of the first Disarmament  Conference was anincrease  in  armaments and  the  actual rearming  of any State.   The  UnitedKingdom Government therefore conceive  the object of the  conference  to be to frame a Disarmament  Convention upon the principle that each State adopts for itself, in agreement  with others, a limitation which is self-imposed and freelyentered into, as part of the mutual obligations of the signatories to one another.There will thus be,  as the  result of the convention, no  distinction of status,-everyone&apos;s armaments  will be controlled  by the same process; and limitationswhich have  already  been prescribed by existing  treaties such as the variousPeace Treaties  or the Naval  Treaties of Washington and  London will, save so-far as they are modified by mutual consent, reappear  in the voluntary and com-prehensive compact  about  to be negotiated at  Geneva.  It will then be  this last-named document which  is the  effective obligation binding upon all.  Thisconception of the work and  purpose of the Disarmament Conference gives the answer, in the view of the United Kingdom Government, to the question of statusraised in the communication  of the  German Government of 29th August.     6.   Questions of status, as distinguished from quantitative questions, involveconsiderations of national pride and dignity which deeply touch the heart of apeople, and keep alive resentment which would otherwise die down and give place to more kindly  feeling.  In  the interests of general appeasement, therefore, it  ismuch  to be desired  that any such  questions should be disposed of  by friendlynegotiation  and  agreed adjustment, not involving either  disregard  of treaty obligations or the increase in the sum total of armed force.  But this desirableconsummation  cannot be attained  by peremptory challenge or by  withdrawal from deliberations which are about to be resumed.  It can only be reached bypatient  discussion  through  the  medium  of  conference between  the States-concerned.     Foreign Office, September 15, 1932.o
