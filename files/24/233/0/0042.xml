The present wholesale prices of frozen meat are at a level 5  which has resulted in grave depression in the livestock industries    of the United  Kingdom and the Dominions.   This  depression is    likely, if continued, to bring about a serious decline in production    and consequent ultimate injury to the consumer.        2. Such a position is so  serious that it is essential  to take10  whatever steps may appear feasible to raise the wholesale prices of    frozen meat in  the United Kingdom market to such a level as will    maintain efficient production.        3. With a view to the earliest possible improvement of the    position, His Majesty&apos;s  Government in the United Kingdom will,15  during the  currency of the Ottawa Agreement, arrange  for the    regulation  of importations of meat  into the  United Kingdom,    the regulation, in view  of the close inter-relationship of all kinds    of meat in  determining the price level,  to be applied to all the    meats referred  to in Section 5.20      4. The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United    Kingdom in relation to meat production is, first, to secure develop-    ment of home production, and, secondly, to give to the Dominions    an expanding share of imports into the United Kingdom.        5. In order to co-operate with His Majesty&apos;s Government in25  the  United Kingdom in  the  carrying  out  of this policy,  His    Majesty&apos;s Government in the Commonwealth of Australia agrees    to limit the export of frozen mutton and lamb to the United    Kingdom for the year 1933 to an amount equivalent to the total    imports from Australia during the year ended the 30th June, 1932,30  in consideration of the United Kingdom  Government         (a) Arranging for the regulation of the importation of foreign            meat  in  accordance with  a  programme  (hereinafter            referred to as the &quot; agreed programme &quot;) agreed between            His Majesty&apos;s  Government in the United Kingdom and35          His Majesty&apos;s  Government in  the  Commonwealth of            Australia and  including within  its scope frozen mutton            and lamb, frozen beef and chilled beef.        (b) Arranging, as soon as possible after receiving the Report            of  the Commission now sitting  on the reorganisation of40          the pig  industry in the United Kingdom, for the quan-            titative  regulation of the supplies of bacon and hams            coming  on to  the United Kingdom  market.        (c) Undertaking that  no  restriction will be placed upon the            importation of  any meat from Australia during  the45          period named in the agreed programme referred to in            Section  5 (a) of this Declaration.
A.D. 1932. 1ST SOH.   con/.AUSTRALIA continued.    6. During the year 1933 and in the light of the  experience gained, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom will consider, in consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Government in theCommonwealth of  Australia, the best means  of  ensuring  an 5improved price situation and  the  more  orderly marketing ofsupplies.    7. Should no permanent policy be agreed upon  as the resultof the consultation referred to above,  His Majesty&apos;s  Governmentin the United Kingdom undertakes, after the expiry of the period 10named in the agreed programme referred to in Section 5 (a) of this declaration and during the remainder  of the period of  the Agree-ment  concluded at Ottawa     (a) To arrange for the continuance, unless otherwise agreed         between  the Governments concerned, of the regulation 15         of the imports of foreign meat at the rates in force at         the end of the period named in the agreed  programme.    (6) In any action affecting the  imports  of meat into the         United Kingdom which the  United Kingdom  Govern-         ment may take on behalf of United Kingdom agriculture         to have regard to the policy set out in Section 4 hereof.    8. Should it  appear  to  His Majesty&apos;s  Government in theUnited Kingdom  after enquiry that, at any time in consequenceof a restriction upon foreign imports, the supplies of meat of any kind are inadequate to meet the requirements of consumers in the 25United Kingdom, then  His  Majesty&apos;s Government may remove any such restriction until supplies are again adequate.20The Agreed Programme referred to in Section 5 (a) of the Declaration                by United Kingdom Government.

New Zealand Delegation,Dear Mr. Baldwin,          Ottawa, Canada, August 19, 1932.     I  HAVE  given further  consideration to the matter of an  15agreement  between  His Majesty&apos;s Government  in the UnitedKingdom and His Majesty&apos;s Government in New  Zealand.  Inmy conversations with  you  and your Ministers we have agreedthat a  policy will be  adopted that  will have for its  definite  .objective the two-fold purpose of raising the price  of meat to a  20remunerative level and of progressively increasing the share of theDominions  in the United Kingdom market.   I accept your under-taking that effective steps will be taken to secure these results.     2. Eor the purpose of restricting  foreign supplies of mutton and lamb, the arrivals, as compared with the corresponding periods  25of the year  ending the 30th June, 1932, as I understand the UnitedKingdom proposal, are to be reduced by at least 10 per cent, forthe  quarter ending the 31st March, 1933,  15 per  cent, for the   iquarter ending the 30th June,  1933, 20 per  cent, for the quarterending the 30th September, 1933,  25 per cent, for the quarter  30ending the  31st December, 1933, 30 per cent, for the quarter ending the 31st March, 1934, and 35 per cent, for the quarter ending the30th June,  1934, and thereafter, unless otherwise agreed betweenthe Governments concerned,  for the remainder of the period of theagreement  concluded at Ottawa by not less than 35 per cent.    35     3. During the year 1933, and in the light of the experience gained, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom will consider, in consultation with His Majesty&apos;s  Government in NewZealand, the best means of ensuring an improved price situation,and the more orderly marketing of supplies.                      40     4. To assist in the orderly marketing of supplies the Dominionwill give a  reliable estimate  of shipments of  mutton and lamb as early as possible in each export season.  This season will neces-
   NEW ZEALAND continued.   sarily  cover the period the  1st  October in one  year to the  AD. 1932.   30th September in the following year.  For  the season 1932-33   iST sCH   we estimate our exports of frozen mutton and lamb at 200,000 tons,    _coni, 5 with a 5 per  cent, increase in each of the following two years.   For the calendar year 1933 you may take it that our  shipments  of   frozen mutton and lamb will be the same as those of the twelve   months ended the 30th June,  1932, i.e., of the year which ended   with the  month  immediately  preceding  the  opening of the10 conference.        5. It is understood that, in consideration of this undertaking   on our part, no restriction will be placed by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-   ment in the United Kingdom  upon the importation  of any meat   from New Zealand  during the  period ending the 30th June, 1934.15      6. In frozen beef, we estimate our exports for the season   1932-33 at not more than  22,000 tons, representing a maximum   increase over the previous season of approximately 10 per cent.        7. With regard  to  bacon and other pig products, I am   informed that your Government are  now dealing  with the re-20 organisation of  this  industry, and  that  an effective policy  of   control of foreign  imports will be adopted.  This  policy,  as  I   understand it, will provide for some expansion of  Home and   Dominion supplies  of pig products.  New Zealand is already an   exporter  of pork  and bacon  carcases and  will be granted  a25 reasonable share of the expansion made possible by the reduction   of foreign imports.        8. All frozen beef (carcases and  boned beef)  from foreign   sources is to be subject to the same reductions as are specified in   paragraph 2.30      9. No increase of chilled  beef imports from foreign sources   into the  United  Kingdom in excess of the  twelve months the   1st July, 1931, to the 30th June, 1932, will be permitted during   the period January 1933 to the 30th June, 1934, and the rate of   importation will not thereafter be increased during the  period of35 the  Ottawa agreement except  with the concurrence of the   Governments concerned.        10.  Should  it  appear  to  His Majesty&apos;s  Government in the   United Kingdom after an enquiry that, at any time, in consequence   of a restriction upon foreign imports, the supplies of meat of any40 land are inadequate  to meet  the requirements  of consumers  in   the United Kingdom, then His Majesty&apos;s Government may remove   any such restriction until supplies are again  adequate.                                          Yours sincerely,                                   (Signed)     J. G.  COATES.45      The Right Hon.

MY colleagues and I recognise that an arrangement between    the  interests  concerned  for  the importation into  the  United    Kingdom of a substantial quantity of  Wabana iron ore is of10  paramount importance to the economic life of Newfoundland.        We therefore give  you  our  assurance,  on behalf  of our    Government, that we shall regard the last paragraph of Article 9    of the Agreement which is being concluded between His Majesty&apos;s    Government in the United Kingdom and His Majesty&apos;s Govern-15  ment in Newfoundland as entitling the Government of Newfound-    land to give us notice that they  are unable to implement the    Agreement,  other than Articles 4, 7 and 8 and Schedule E, on the    ground that a satisfactory arrangement between the interests    concerned as regards the  importation of such ore into the United20  Kingdom has not been concluded.        In that event it is understood between us that the Agreement,    other than Articles 4, 7 and 8 and Schedule E, will be regarded as    at an end.I shall be glad to learn from you at your early convenience    I have received  your letter of to-day&apos;s  date regarding theAgreement between our respective Governments and I agree with you  that your  letter  correctly represents  the  understanding between us.25 whether you concur  that this correctly represents  our under-   standing.

When the Agreement between the British and Indian Delega- 25tions was made at Ottawa it was found necessary to postpone  afinal settlement of certain questions relating to iron and steel.By Article  1 of the Agreement His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom undertook to continue after the 15th November-free  entry to aU classes of Indian goods  covered by the Import 30Duties Act.  It was clearly understood, however, between the twoDelegations that the continuance of the free entry of Indian ironand steel for a longer period than six months from the date of theAgreement was dependent on the settlement of satisfactory condi-tions in regard  to  the tariff treatment  of galvanised  sheet on 35importation into India.  At the same time an understanding wasreached that the conditions which would be satisfactory to HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom were as follows :      (1)  On the basis  of  present selling prices, the duties on        galvanised sheet  in the Indian  tariff to be adjusted as 40        follows :             30 rupees per ton on sheet  made in the United           Kingdom from Indian sheet bar.            53 rupees per ton on sheet  made in the United           Kingdom from other sheet bar.                     , 45            83 rupees per ton on sheet not made in the United           Kingdom.

(2) In the event of further reductions in the price of sheet       19o2.            imported  into India  and  not made  in  the  United   IST&quot;SCH            Kingdom, the Government of India,  as soon as they are    -con/. 5          satisfied that a fall in prices had in fact occurred, would,            without an enquiry by the Tariff Board, take prompt and            effective action to meet the situation by the imposition            of an additional  duty.  The amount of the  additional            duty would not necessarily be limited to the amount of10          the price reduction actually made, but would be sufficient            to make clear the intention of the  Government of India            to maintain prices.        (3) Each Government would remain at liberty to take appro-            priate measures to prevent sales at unfair prices by the15          manufacturers in the  other country, or  to  check  an            unnecessary increase in prices against the consumer by            a combination of manufacturers in both countries.        (4) These arrangements  to remain in  force until action is            taken by  the Government of India  following the next20          statutory Tariff enquiry in India into the Iron and Steel            industry.        2. The Indian Delegation are now prepared to undertake, on    behalf of the Government of India,  that proposals will be placed    before the  Indian  Legislature for the  adjustment  of  the duties25  on galvanised sheet at the rates set forth in clause (1) above, and    for obtaining the powers  which are necessary to carry out the    intention of clauses (2) and (3).  I  have been authorised by my    colleagues of the Indian Delegation to make this communication    to you, and I have now the honour to request that you will inform30  me whether the  terms  of the understanding have been correctly    stated in this letter.

Sir,                                    September 22, 1932.        I have to thank you for  your letter of to-day&apos;s date on the    subject of the tariff treatment to be accorded to galvanised sheets40  imported into India, and to confirm that the terms of the under-    standing which has been reached in this connection by our respec-    tive Governments are accurately set out in your letter.
