[This  Document is the Property oi His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]CIVIL  DISOBEDIENCE  MOVEMENT.MEMORANDUM BY THE -SECRETARY OF 8TAr.TE FOR INDIA.   I circulate  for the consideration of my colleagues a note on a  Bill which  theGovernment of  India  have introduced in the Legislative Assembly with the object of continuing certain of  the powers now granted to Local Governments  by the special powers Ordinance.   There can be no doubt that the continuance of special powers beyond the  end ofthe year is necessary.  But the Government  of  India think that they will only  beobtained by the use of the Governor-Genera]&apos;s powers of certifying the Bill.   The useof this power is always violently resented in India.  We have to face the possibility that it may  drive the Liberals once more out of the  Conference.  Moreover, in the november Session of the  Assembly there will come up  for consideration  not only theBill in question, but the Ottawa Agreement.  One of the  Indian delegates at Ottawa,Mr. Chetty, who is prepared to support the Agreement in the Assembly, has said thatthe certification of the  Bill to replace  the  Ordinances will ruin  any chance  of acceptance of the Ottawa Agreement.   As  I have  said, the continuance  of  the  special powers  by which the CivilDisobedience Movement was beaten is essential, and  the question is whether anythingcan be done  to lessen  the resentment that will follow certification.   There  are two possible lines.  The first concerns the duration of the special powers, the  second their scope.   It will be seen from the note below that the  Government of India propose that someof the powers they want should only come into force by notification, that is to say,they will not be operative  except in emergencies.  There  may be value in this ; inany case it is more consistent with the undertaking that the special powers will  beretained only for so  long as they  are necessary.   The Government of India  areprepared to  meet any pressure in the Select Committee on  the Bill to extend this principle of suspending  the operation  of the  law until  the emergency occurs.   Butthey want the portions affecting the Press to be continuously in operation.    A further point is  whether the Bill to be certified should be without limit of time,or should have force for a  limited period, say, for  three years.  The Government ofIndia say that the objection to certification will not  be minimised by limited duration of the Bill.  There is, however, the further question whether we should force through a Bill giving to the future autonomous  Governments  arbitrary powers which  indian political opinion says  it does not want and will not be&apos;required.  I should have thoughtnot.    The other possible line of concession to be  considered  is the scope of the powers.I am afraid there is not much room for change here.  The only part of the Bill whichI feel hesitation&apos; about certifying is &quot; E &quot; provision for payment  by parents of finesimposed upon  their  children.   It  is  difficult  to  argue that this  is  of  sufficient importance to warrant the use of the certification powers of the Governor-General.    My own  conclusion is that the Bill to be certified should be a three years1 Bill,that so far as possible the powers should  come into force by notification and  shouldnot be  part of the normal law,  and that if strong objection is taken to  part  &quot;E&quot; itshould not form, part  of the certified Bill.    The result may  be that the Liberals will withdraw  from the Conference, and thatthe opposition to the Ottawa Agreement  may be increased  (the first is, I think, less likely than the second).  But the paramount need is that Government should not lose on 1st January the means of fighting Civil Disobedience.    The  final decision need not be taken  until the  Bill is before the  Assembly inNovember.   But it is  important that  the Government  of India should know our general view of the matter before they  go into the Select Committee on the Bill earlyin October.   The attitude of the Assembly will become apparent in  the Committeeand it  may be  that  further consideration will be  necessaiy  in  the  light of  theproceedings.    India Office,24th September 1932.SAMUEL HOARE.123960  9.32
Government of India&apos;s proposed Legislation to replace the                  Special Powers Ordinance.   The Special Powers  Ordinance,  which replaced  the  Ordinances promulgated lastJanuary to cope with the civil disobedience movement  in India, will expire on  the30th December next.  It is highly  improbable, however, that  Local GoVernments, or at any rate some of them, will be able on that date to surrender the special authority with which they are invested at present.  It has already been decided        (a) that the powers  still required should he taken by legislation and not  by    promulgation of a further Ordinance, and       (b) that the Government of India should legislate for the powers likely to  be    necessary in India generally and  Local Governments for the more extraordinary    powers necessary only  in particularly bad areas.   2. The Government of India have accordingly introduced a Bill in the LegislativeAssembly.  The text of the Bill is not yet available, but its terms are as shown  in theappendix  to this Note.  It will be observed that it covers the following matters  :-       (a) It authorises the seizure of  property and the forfeiture of  the funds of     associations declared to be unlawful.       These powers may be regarded as a  natural complement to the Indian Criminal     Law  Amendment Act,  1908, which  enables Local Governments to  declare  to  be     &quot; unlawful&quot; associations which  have  for their  object  interference with the     maintenance of law and order  or constitute a  danger to the public peace ;  and     provides for the punishment of persons assisting such associations.       (b) It provides for the punishment of certain forms of  intimidation, including     molestation and boycotting.       The  definition of  &quot;molestation&quot; follows that  of &quot;criminal  intimidation&quot;&apos;     contained in the Indian Penal  Code, but, in consequence of the methods adopted     by Congress picketers, especially in Bombay, has been  so amplified as to make     picketing of any kind  illegal.        (cj It removes the time limit from and enlarges  the scope of the Indian Press     (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931, which expires in October 1933.        Here the most important clause is that which enables action to be taken  by the     Executive Government against a newspaper publishing matter tending to bring     the  Government into hatred  and  contempt.    Indian  opinion holds  that  the     wording is sufficiently wide  to bring  within the mischief of the Act severe but     legitimate criticism, and maintains that the appeal to the High Court against the     orders  of Government provided for in  the Act is not a sufficient safeguard.        (d) It provides punishment for             (1) inducing public, servants to disregard or fail in their duty;            (2) dissuading persons  from enlisting in the military or police forces ;            (3) spreading  false rumours likely  to  cause  fear or alarm,  or hatred or          contempt of public servants ;            (4) circulating  or repeating the contents of proscribed documents.        These  provisions may be justified as a necessary part of the ordinary law.        (e) It provides for the pajmient  of fines imposed  on young persons by parents     or guardians and for their imprisonment in case of default.        A similar provision  is to be found  in  the  Children&apos;s Acts already in force     in some  Provinces.  In the civil disobedience movement  it has not been  largely     used but is considered a valuable asset inasmuch as  it has induced  parents and     guardians to exercise  more than ordinary care to prevent their children  or wards     from participating.        (/) It makes  cognisable and non-bailable any offence under the Bill and under     the  Criminal Law Amendment  Act,  1908, and certain sections of  the  Indian     Penal Code.        The power to arrest without warrant has proved  of especial value to the police     in coping with the  civil  disobedieuce movement.  Indians are  loth  to make     complaints to the authorities, and, if  they do make them, the police, by the time     they are  authorised to  act, find difficulty  in  tracing the evidence  necessary to     secure convictions. In particular, the provisions against  intimidation contained       1239                                                              A  2
     in the Penal  Code have long been recognised  to be  ineffective owing to the     offence being  non-cognisable (he. requiring a magistrate^ warrant before arrest     can be made).    3.  The Government of India are emphatic  that the powers  contained  in  the bill are  required permanently.   They propose that  the clauses  relating to intimidationshould come into force only on issue of a notilication which would  state the areas  towhich they applied, and which would be withdrawn when the  powers ceased to  benecessary.  They are also  prepared in the Select Committee, to which the Bill hasnow  been referred, to accept a corresponding  provision in respect of  the  powersincluded under the heads (d) and (e) in the  preceding paragraph, but hold strongly that the remaining powers should be permanently at the disposal  of the executive.They argue that, though these powers were first taken to meet the civil disobedience movement of  1930, experience has shown  that such  a&apos; movement can  easily bere-started or revived.   The  anti-partition agitation of 1905-8 in Bengal, the  non-co-operation movement of 1921-2, the conditions  of 1930 and those  now existing showthat dangerous methods of agitation are not a novel or singular feature of political life in Iudia, and it is not unlikely that similar movements will recur during the unsettledperiod following  the introduction  of the  new Constitution.  The powers would thus be an insurance for the autonomous Provincial  Governments against  future trouble.    As regards the control  of the  Press, the  Government of India point out that experience has shown that  both communal and anti-Government agitation  have beenfostered  and kept alive by the Press, and that this is particularly so in the  case  ofthe terrorist movement in Bengal and the Punjab.  In the interval between the lapse of the Press Ordiuance in March 1931 and the passing of the Indian Press (emergency powers) Act in October, newspapers lent support to civil disobedience and tended  tocreate conditions of disorder.  The Government of India have no doubt that the Presswill  need coutrol during the early years of the new Constitution, and that the newGovernments will  be  especially reluctant to take the necessary powers  by fresh legislation.   4. It cannot be denied that there is &quot;weight in the Government of India&apos;s arguments for  taking permanently  the  powers  contained in their  Bill.  It must, however, berecognised that even in the  present emergency it has not proved  necessary to applythose under heads (a), (b), (d) and  (e) to large  areas  of India.  Further, when these special powers  were taken, it  was declared that they would be  retained only for solong as they were necessary.   The reply to a question asked in the House of commons by Mr. Wallhead on the 8th February last contained the following  sentence :        &quot; I should like to make it clear that it  is the desire of the  Government of India     and of His Majesty&apos;s Government that these  special powers taken to combat the     civil  disobedience movement should be  withdrawn as soon as circumstances     justify their  withdrawal.&quot;   5. This undertaking  to  withdraw the powers when possible relates  to  powerstaken by the arbitrary method of an Ordinance and  does not  in any way precludetheir permanent retention with the approval of the Indian Legislature.  Unfortunatelythis  approval is unlikely to  be forthcoming  and  resort will  have to  be  had to theViceroy&apos;s  power  of certification.  In reply to  a  suggestion that  the Bill might hecertified  for a  limited period, say three years,  the Government  of India say thatlimitation would not secure its  acceptance   by the  Legislative   Assembly  and,certification being required, they are strongly in favour of certification of the Bill in a form which will not only meet immediate necessities, but also enable future Govern-ments  to deal adequately with any similar situation with which  they may be faced.They urge, therefore, that the Bill should  be made  law substantially as introduced.They do not  anticipate that this will arouse more criticism than  certification of an act of limited duration.
