 IS DOCUMENT 18 THB PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.                                                         COPY    _^342( 32) .                               CABINET.               THE REPUTATION OF MEAT IMPORTS IN RELATION TO THE                INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS OF THB UNITED KINGDOM.        Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs                   and the President of the Board of Trade.           It was proposed in CP.295/32 that in the event of the      quantitative regulation of the imports of meat, to he enforced      as a result of the Ottawa Agreements, being challenged by any      foreign country on the ground that it  is inconsistent with our      obligations under the International Convention for the Abolition      of Import and Sxport Prohibitions and Restrictions, we should      justify our aotion by invoking the clause in the Convention which      leaves it free to any contracting party to adopt measures      prohibiting or restricting importation or exportation for the      purpose of protecting in extraordinary and abnormal circumstances      the vital interests of the country.   In CP. 316/32 certain      objections were raised to this proposal.           We have now considered the matter further jointly and       in view of the fact that the United States of America alone of all       countries signatory of the International Convention will be      affected and as the United States of America is at present      unable to take Great Britain before any arbitral tribunal on       the question we recommend to our colleagues that they should       accept the proposal made in CP. 295/32, on the understanding      however that this country should denounce the Imports and Exports      Prohibitions Convention at  the earliest possible date.   The       earliest date at which we can free ourselves from the Convention       is, in fact, the 1st July,  1933.                                               J.S.                                               W.R.       10th October, 1932.
