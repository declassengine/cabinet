DRAFT                OF A         BILLTo enable effect to be given to the Agreements  made on the twentieth day of Augu t, nine-  teen hundred and thirty-two, at the Imperial  Economic Conference held at Ottawa, and to  a &apos; certain announcement made at that Con-  ference on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government  in the United Kingdom, by imposing and  providing for the imposition of certain duties  of customs and otherwise;  and for purposes  consequential on  and connected with the  matters aforesaid.XXXII.-A.  (8.)Wh October 1932.189-8
                                                                9 0 n                     OTTAWA AGREEMENTS BILL.               DRAFT 189-6;  SHORT NOTES ON GLAUSES.5 0            The Bill is primarily &quot;to enable effect to be        given to the Ottawa Agreements0&quot;  Its other purposes,viz:        to give effect to the promised Colonial preferences on        bananas and grape-fruit;  and &quot;purposes consequential on        and connected with the matters aforesaid&quot;, are all        ancillary to the primary purposec  The promise of the        Colonial preferences, though not embodied in any Agreement,        was given at Ottawa in the form of an Announcement  by        the United Kingdom Delegation, and is therefore germane        to the Billo  But it would not be possible to extend the        scope of the Bill so as to cover something wholly distinct        from Ottawa, e0g0  a settlement with the Irish Free State.s 10(1)o     This provides for the imposition of the new &quot;Ottawa&quot;        duties.             The duties are set out comprehensively in Part I of        the Second Schedule to the Bill, in a form slightly        different from that of the Agreements.  This was found        necessary, partly for clearness of exposition, partly        because the wording of the Agreements was hastily adopted        and in some cases  is not sufficiently precise for purposes        of Customs administration,.  There is of course no departure        from the Intention of the Agreements,,             It is proposed that the duties should not come into        force automatically, as soon as the Bill becomes law, but        as from a date or  dates to be fixed by the Treasury (see        clause 13 (2)).   In the case of India and Newfoundland at        least there may be some doubt whether  the Agreements  will        be ratified; and it would be mistaken policy to impose the        duties provided  for by those  Agreements  without        rr The announcement is in these  terms:- &quot;The British          Government will  invite Parliament to convert the present          duty on bananas  into a specific duty of 2s.6dc  per  cwt0 and          to  extend the  duty on grape, fruit to cover the  whole year.&quot;                                   -1-
the certainty of any reciprocal advantage, and withthe risk that they might subsequently have tc he takenGff again.   In the case of the -vther Dominions therisk of non-ratification is no doubt negligible:  butit is clearly necessary to treat all alike in thisrespect.          Where the same duty is provided under morethan one Agreement, it roust be brought into force assoon as any one of the Dominions concerned has takenpower tc fulfil the Agreement, and once in force, itwill operate to the benefit, not only cf the Dominionwhich has already taken power as aforesaid,  but of allthe rest of the Empire, including the ether Dominionswhose Agreements provide for this particular duty, eventhough they may not yet have taken power te  fulfil these agreements. No ^ther arrangement appears to  be practicable.          In the same way a duty common to two or moreAgreements will remain in force as long as a single oneof the Dominions concerned with that particular dutycontinues to fulfil its Agreement!  and the  benefit ofsuch a duty will continue to be enjoyed by all the restcf the Empire with the exception of any one  or moreDominions which have ceased to fulfil these  Agreements.(Such a Dominion,  as explained below, will,  as from thedate when it ceases to fulfil its  Agreement, be treated for the purpose of the Ottawa duties like  a  foreign country.  )Except that goods grown, produced or manufactured in another part of theEmpire, and consigned from such a dominion, v/ill continue to be entitledto the benefit of the Agreements,(soe note on Clause 20)
e %a(2)e     This  subsection requires the  Treasury  to  remove  a  duty,       or  vary the  rate  downwards,  or to  except  certain articles       from a class of  dutiable  goods,  if this can be  done  &quot;without       contravening any  of  the  agreements for the  time &quot;being in       forces&quot; The phrase  &quot;for  the time  &quot;being in  force&quot;  is       defined in Clause 9o  The language of clause 1  (2) covers       several different cases,  including:                 (i)     the  case of the removal  or variation                        downwards of a  duty or the alteration                        of  a class  of dutiable goods by                        excepting certain articles (e.g0                        cider apples) by  agreement &quot;between                        the  United  Kingdom and any other                        country  concerned;                 (ii)    the  case of an  agreement &quot;being                        determined  in accordance with  its                        terms (the  Indian agreement can                        he determined at  any time  on  six                        months notice);                 (iii)   the  case of Empire producers being                        unable to offer to the United                        Kingdom  at  world  prices  and in                        sufficient  quantities a-commodity                        (such as wheat  in grain, copper,                        lead or  zinc) the duty on  which                        is  conditional  on that &quot;being                        done j                 (iv)    the  case of a country which,                        having taken the  necessary steps  -                        and  begun to fulfil the  agreements                        subsequently ceases to do  so                        without  the consent of the                        United Kingdom.      /   The  case  of a  country  taking  no steps  to fulfil the          Agreement at all,  e0g0 India, would be dealt with          under clauses  15  (2) and  9*7
e i (3)                 This  provides  for-  the  opposite  contingency,             sc.  the reimposition,  or increase  of a  duty (but not             beyond the rate specifiea in the Second Schedule)  if             it is necessary for the  fulfilment of an agreement             which is for the time  being  in force.    For example,             (a)  if a Duty has been reduced by  consent,  and is             subsequently increased again by  consent;   or             (b)  if a country which has defaulted subsequently             repents and carries out  the  Agreement,  the  Treasury is             bound to bring  the (increased) duty  into  force.                       It will be observed that both these  sub-clauses             are  mandatory.    The Treasury are  given no  discretionary             power.e 1 (4)                 The effect of  this sub-section, with the twc             provisos,  is that the  &quot;Ottawa&quot; duties are to be charged             in lieu of any  existing  duties under the  Import Duties             Act,  whether general ad  valorem  (proviso  (a)),  or             additional (proviso (b));  but in  addition  to  any  other             duties,  i.e.  Finance Act duties.                       In the case  of Dried Fruits there may appear             at first sight  to be a discrepancy between  the  duty in             the  Second&quot; Schedule  and  that in  Schedule  3  of  (e.g. )             the  Canadian Agreement.    In the former the amount (of             the  new duty only)  is  3s.6d.  per cwt.,  in the  latter.             10s. 6d. ,  (for both old and new duties combined).    The             latter  however  adds  in the first column to  the  Schedule             &quot;now  dutiable at 7/-&quot;;   so that  the  figures are not             difficult  to  reconcile.   The wording of  the clause is             necessary  for two  reasons:                  (i)   because  otherwise  if the  duty were required             to be removed under  clause 1  (3),  the old as well  as             the new  duty  would  disappear.    That  of course was never             intended.
               (ii)  because certain goods included in the Schedule          (e.g.  canned and dried fruits)  are already dutiable in          respect of sugar content, and such duty must,  for revenue          reasons, continue to be collected in addition to the          &quot;Ottawa&apos;1 duties.1 (5)(a)        The  intention of this sub-section is to enable the          Advisory Committee to make recommendations as to any of the          goods dutiable under the Second Schedule,  including          those commodities (wheat, maize,  copper and linseed) which          are now on the Free List, but excepting - see the proviso  -          dried fruits, as to which, being already dutiable          under the  Finance Acts, the Committee would not anyhow          have power to make a recommendation.    The argument is          that any of these goods could have been made  the subject                               x          of an additional duty, in the  interest of the  United          Kingdom producer, before Ottawa;   the Ottawa  Conference          has resulted in the imposition of certain duties for the          benefit of Dominion producers,  and these duties cannot of          course  be  reduced  while the Agreements remain in force;          but there  is no reason why they should not be  still          further increased,  in the interest of the  United Kingdom          producer,  if the  latter can convince  the Advisory Committee                                            /                                            7&quot;          that such  an increase is justified.i (5)(b)          This  applies to goods chargeable  with  &quot;Ottawa&quot;          duties  certain provisions applicable  to  goods  dutiable          under the  import  Duties Act, with reference e.g.  to  draw-          backs,  machinery  for ascertaining values,  the  collection          by  the  Board  of Trade  of information  concerning production,          etc,          x                  Goods now on the  Free List would first have had to          be  removed from  the  Free List by  Order under S.7 of the          Finance Act,  1932,          /          The Advisory  Committee  can  only recommend an additional          duty on goods  in respect of which they are satisfied that          certain conditions are fulfilled.   It would seem doubtful          whether these  conditions could ever be said to be fulfilled          in  respect of maize, copper and linseed.
                                                    0) * O     This provides for the exemption of the &quot;agreeing&quot; countries from  the &quot;Ottawa&quot;  duties and all duties under the  Import  Duties Act so  long as  the agreement  is for the  time being  in force.     The determination of the question whether  a scheduled agreement &quot;is for  the time &quot;being in force&quot; is left to the Treasury, under  clause 9 of the bill     It should  be noted that this clause  involves a departure from  the procedure contemplated in the Agreements, viz:   that  exemption from the duties under the  Import Duties Act  should be granted after November 15th by means of Orders under Section 4 of that Act.    The new procedure is simpler  and  will take  up  less  Parliamentary  time)   more- over,  it would  seem that  the procedure contemplated by the Agreements  would not be legally effective, since what Section 4 requires is not an Order, but a Resolution of the House  of Commonso     It should  also he noted that the clause involves  a departure from  the policy adopted in s04(4) of  the Import Duties Act, 1932o   The general effect of that  subsection is that where goods produced in a Dominion become chargeable with duty,,  goods consigned from the Dominion, but produced in another  part of the British Empire, will also (with certain exceptions) be chargeable with duty.    As the  hill is now draf tedp this subsection wi3.1 be virtually repealed except to an insignificant extent.    The chief reason for this is that the Customs, (who, since the Import Duties Act was  passed, have been considering the action they would have to take to  enforce the subsection) have come to the conclu- sion that its provisions  are administratively unworkable. Under the Bill as it now  stands s.4(4) of the Import DutiesAct will only he alive to this extent:- supposing no resolution is passed under s.4(2)   of the Import Duties Act exempting goods produced in the Free State from the general ad valorem duty, goods produced in  the Colonies and Protectorates (but not goods produced in the Dominions or India)and consigned from  Ireland will, after 15th November,he chargeable with the general ad valorem duty.    This is  an anomaly, but it cannot be removed by this Billy  since  its removal has nothing to do with the Ottawa agreements.
     The proviso to clause 2(1) reserves power to theTreasury to review the &quot;basis of preference on the goodsmentioned in Schedule A to the Canadian Agreement (viz,eggs, poultry, butter, cheese and other milk products)after the period of 3 years&apos; free entry guaranteed bythat Schedule.
(2)        Relations with  th?  Irish Free  State.         There  are  three classes  of duties  to he. considered in    relation to the Irish  Free State.         A.   Those  imposed  by the Import Duties Act, namely    the General Ad  Valorem duty of 10-&apos;,  and the Additional Duties.         B.   The duties cf 20*- imposed  on certain  imports from  the    Irish Free  State  under the Irish  Free State  (Special Duties)    Act, 1932.         C.   The Ottawa Duties.         In a Memorandum to the Ottawa  Legislation Committee    (O.L.(52)3), the  president of the Board of Trade  proposed that,    pending the settlement cf the financial dispute,  we  should    regard the  future of our commercial relations  with  Ireland  as    In suspense and not impose duties on Irish goods  except under    the Special Duties Act procedure.         The Committee at  their meeting on  the 4th October    approved this policy,  and decided that  the Bill should be    drafted so  as to  give  effect  to  it.         In oreparing the  draft,  the  Inter-departmental  Conference                                                   with the I.F.S,    have taken  into account the possibility that   a  Settlement/may    fall into two parts:   first,  a settlement of the  financial    dispute, and secondly, possibly  after  a considerable interval,    the conclusion of a Trade Agreement.   It is  presumed that  the    settlement  of the financial dispute will be  followed immediately    by the removal of the  Special Duties:   and  that the  conclusion    of a Trade  Agreement will be  accompanied by  fresh legislation    applying the provisions of the Ottawa Bill generally to the    Irish Free  State.   But what is  to be the position during the    interval, if any,  between these two  stages?  &quot;         It  is  suggested  that our policy should be to apply during    that interval an  intermediary treatment, less  severe than that    under the Special  Duties Act, but not so favourable  as that    accorded under  tho Ottawa Agreements; that this should continue                                 -7-
for a minimum period of (six months);,  to allow time  for a trade Agreement to be concluded;  but that if, at the end ofthat period, nc such Agreement has been made,  the Irish FreeState should thenceforth be treated in the sane wary as a dominion which has defaulted from its Ottawa Agreement.     If this policy is approved, effect could be given to it    (a) by a Resolution of the House of Commons under s.4(8)of  the Import Duties Act (to be passed before the lbthNovember next) that exemption of goods from the Irish FreeState from the Duties under that Act be continued for so longas  the Special Duties Act remains in force:    (b) by the. provisions of this sub-section  tc the effect?that the Ottawa Duties shall not be imposed or. goods from theIrish Free State  so long as the Special Duties Act remains  inforce, and for a  period of  (six months) thereafter, unless  theHouse of Commons  by resolution passed before  the (six months,have expired should extend  the period of  exemption.     The effect cf  this would be that as  soon as a settlementof  the Financial  dispute is reached, the  Special Duties wouldbe  taken off (by  Treasury Order under Section 1  (9) of  theSpecial Duties Act  revoking the existing  Orders); and  the ImportDuties Act duties would then  (since the resolution passedunder s.4 (S) of  that Act would have expired) become chargeableon  goods from the Irish Free State and  continue  to be  so chargeduntil further legislation is passed2&quot;.x Parliamentary Counsel have advised (i) that the power to postpone imposition of these duties cannot be exercised againafter the 15th November? and (ii) that the power cf theTreasury under Section 4(3) of the Import Duties Act to exemptany particular class of description :\of goods from these duties could not be exercised so as to exempt permanently all goods of whatsoever description from a particular country.
      Those however are the only duties,  other than Budget duties *      to which Irish Free State goods will he liable for at least      6 months.   At the end of that time, unions a Trade Agreement      has been reached meanwhile, the Ottawa duties will automatic-      ally become chargeable in addition and the Irish Free State      will then be in exactly the same position as an &quot;Ottawa&quot;      Dominion which has failed to carry out its agreement.  It seems      desirable that the imposition of these duties should commence      on the expiration of a given time limit without overt action       either by Parliament or the Executive; but power is given to      Parliament to extend the period of exemption if necessary,      e.g. to cover an unavoidable interval between the conclusion       cf a Trade Agreement and the passing of the necessary confirm-      at&amp;ry Act.   In this respect the procedure proposed follows      Section 4 of the Import Duties Act.2(3)           This sub-section provides for examption from the      &quot;Ottawa&quot; duties of goods grown, produced or manufactured in the      Colonial Empire, and consigned from any part of the Empire.      The sub-section will not applj to a mandated territory unless      an Order in Council has been made under Section 5(2) of the      Import Duties&quot; Act 1938, applying that Section to that territory.2(4)            This refers to territories, such.as Papua and Samoa,      ir: respect of which a Mandate is being administered by a      Dominion.2(5)          This sub-section provides a necessary exception to the      general rule that Imperial preference is only given to      Empire goods if consigned from within the Empire.             There is no copper refinery  at present in the United      Kingdom and Rhodesian copper is  therefore sent to the4- In respect of the-Budget duties It is assumed that the usual Empire preferences will continue to be granted to the Irish Free State throughout, as at present.
United States of America to be refined, and issubsequently consigned thence to the United Kingdom.Unless Rhodesian copper is to be deprived of thebenefit of the copper duty, it is essential that theBill shall provide that such copper shall be treatedas if consigned direct to the United Kingdom.   But  itis proposed that this special concession shall &quot;belimited to a period of say 3 years, which should givesufficient time to establish a refinery within theUnited Kingdom in order to take advantage of thepreference.   the matter is however to be subject tofurther consideration by the President of the  Board ofTrade on the conclusion of his discussions with thecopper interests.         The concession was agreed upon at Ottawa withthe representatives of Southern and Northern Rhodesia.Per the moment it does not seem necessary to extend itto copper produced in other parts of the Empire.Canada, which is the principal, if not the only other,Empire producer, has large facilities for refining,and would probably not be sorry for a chance to bring pressure on the copper producers to refine at homerather than in the United States of America; andon administrative grounds it is preferable to limit the  concession as strictly as10.
               possible, in view cf the difficulty of distinguishing               between copper of foreign and Canadian origin on ex-               port from the United States of America.e 8(6)*              This application of certain previsions of the               Import Duties Act is merely necessary machinery,                    This clause  gives effect to the  provision in               Schedule C of the Australian and South African Agree-               ments that wine not exceeding 25 degrees of proof spirit                                             s* d               shall receive a preference  of 2/- per gallon.   The                              s. d                     s. do               present  duty is 3/-,  and the preference  l/- .  To  in-                                        s. d*               crease the preference to 2/-  without changing the duty                                                         s. d.               would bring the preferential rate down to l/-   only,               which is too low  for  revenue purposes.   It is  necessary               therefore,  for administrative  reasons, to increase the                       8. d.               duty  to  4/-   (paragraph  (a)  of the  clause),  thus               leaving  the  preferential rate  at 2/-  as  at present.                    Proviso  (i)  directs that  the Treasury,  if they               are  satisfied that  the preferential rate is no longer               required for the  fulfilment  of any  scheduled                                                           s. d.               agreement,  shall  reduce  the  preference from 2/-   to               s* d.                              Sc d.               l/-  , thus leaving  the duties  at  4/-   (full) and               s. d.               3/-   (preferential).   The Bill  as drafted does not               however  empower the Treasury to bring  d^v/n  the  duty               from  4/-  to  o/-  ,  even  if  the  higher  rate  is  no               linger required by  any Agreement in force.   It is felt               that  this  will  leave  the Chancellor of the  Exchequer               with  a freer hand in  respect of what  is  essentially               a Revenue  duty.   The  position  can of  course v,e  dealt               with  if  necessary in  the succeeding Finance Bill.
     Proviso (ii) provides that,  if one  of  the  twocountries whose Agreements provide  for the  wine  preference(Australia and South Africa),  but not  both,  should  cease to fulfil the Agreement,  that  country  will  cease to enjoy the &quot;Ottawa&quot; preferential rate of duty on wine.     This clause stabilises for 10 years the preferenceon Empire tobacco, in order to give effect  to Article  7  ofthe Canadian Agreement,  and the similar  provisions  in  theSouth African, Indian (Article 6) and  Southern  Rhodesian(Article 2) Agreements.     Under Article 3 of the Indian Agreement and article of the Southern Rhodesian Agreement, we are pledged                         s.d.              s.d.to grant a  preference of 9/4  (instead of 2/4  as atpresent) on Empire coffee.     There are various ways in which this might be  done,having regard to the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;revenue requirements.   The proposal in  the textadvocated by the Commissioner of Customs and Excise,                                                s. d.is to leave the full rate of duty unchanged at  14/-                      s. d.and to reduce this by 9/4  for Empire  produce.     The provisos follow those in Clause 5.     This clause provides for the so-called &quot;Russianembargo&quot;;.    In form it is applicable  to any countrybut in practice  it will only be used against Russia,because  it  could not be used in contravention ofexisting commercial treaties, and the  Russian is theonly treaty that we intend to denounce with a view
              to replacing it  in due  course &quot;by  a new one providing              for action  as contemplated in this clause.                     The  clause  is  inserted with a view to carrying              out the Ottawa Agreement only, i.e., Article 21 of              the Canadian Agreement ;   and that Agreement refers              only to the  need of safeguarding the preferences              granted ty the Canadian Agreement.   It would not be              possible, even if it were desired, v/ithin the scope              cf  the  present Bill, to provide for the extension of              the  clause so as to safeguard the  preferences on goods              produced by  other parts of the Empire, and not covered              by the  Canadian Agreement.     Reference is made to              the  discussion on this point  at  the first meeting of              the  Ottawa Legislation Committee (pp^.  2 and 3 of the             Minutes).use 5(1)            These two sub-sections have been redrafted in2) .              accordance with the instructions of the Cabinet Ottawa             Legislation Committee so as to follow as  closely as             possible the wording of Article 21 of  the Canadian  Agreement.             There is still, however, this difference  between the             two drafts:   the Article provides  for the prohibition             of &quot;the entry from such  foreign  country directly or             indirectly&quot;  of the goods in question;   the clause             provides for the prohibition  of  the importation of the             goods in question if &quot;grown manufactured  or produced             in that foreign country&quot;,.   That is to say the  Article
            prohibits the importation of  goods  consigned from            Russia, directly or indirectly,  v/herever the goods            may have been produced;    the clause prohibits the            importation of goods produced in Russia v/hencever            they may have been consigned.    The reason for this            discrepancy is that, in  view  of  the Customs, to make            &quot;first consignment11 the  test  instead of &quot;production&quot;            would lead to considerable administrative difficulty;            and it is thought that there  is  no  difference in            substance between the two provisions and that the            clause fulfils the spirit of  the agreement.ction              These provide machinery for  enforcing the (5).            clause.    Sub-clause (5)  enables goods prohibited            under this clause to be  treated  for the purposes of            seizure;, forfeit, and panalties, as goods to which            the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, applies. 6  (1).             This refers to Article  7  of  the Indian            Agreement, which provides for  the admission into            the United Kingdom, free  of duty from all sources,            of  the goods specified in Schedule  D to that            Agreement (shellac, raw  jute,  Indian hemp, etc.)
*           Under So  1 (3)  of the  Import  Duties Act,  the Treasury            can only  add articles  to  the  Free  List  on the  recommendation            of the Advisory committee   The  Advisory  Committee cannot,            however,  he required by the Executive  to  make  any particular-            re commendation%  and in order to ensure that the Indian            Agreement shall be carried  out,  it is  necessary to provide            that these particular  goods shall  be adcled  to  the Free            List by the Treasury without  such recommendation.                 The  words in the  last  line  of page 8 &quot;to  such extent            as appears to the Treasury  to be necessary  for the purpose            etc.&quot; are inserted in  order to enable  the Treasury to            define the terms &quot;shellac&apos;1, &quot;Indian hemp&quot; etc for Customs            purposes, more precisely  than in the Agreement itself,            which is  somewhat loosely worded,                 The  object of the proviso is  to ensure that, if and whenj            the Indian agreement ceases to be  in force, the goods  in            question  will automatically be removed from the free list.            This appears to follow from the  decision  of the Ottawa            Legislation Committee  on  Clause  8y which  was to the effect            that it was beyond the scope  of  the Bill  to prolong the            duration  of any provision of  the Bill  beyond the duration            of the agreement on which it  was dependent. This decision            however did not expressly extend to Clause  6,  and therefore            the proviso is placed  in  square  brackets  for consideration.-use 6 (2)        It is thought that the grant  to the  Treasury of            power to  refer any question under  this Bill to the Import            Duties Advisory Committee may prove very  useful.   The            Advisory  Committee are quite  willing to act as proposed.use 7.           This provides for the  regulation  of  imports of frozen            and chilled meat in accordance with the provisions of            Article 6 and Schedule H  of the  Australian  Agreement.
se  v% (4).The effect of this subsection is that the clause  and orders made thereunder will only remain in force so longas the Australian agreement is in force.,  This againappears to follow from the decision of the CabinetCommittee on Clause 8 (see note on C1.6 (1))*  In this case however there may be some doubt whether the life ofthe clause ought to be dependent, not only on the life of the Australian agreement, but also on the life of theSouth African and New Zealand agreements:  for both these agreements are concerned with the regulation of meat imports (see Art0 7 of the South African agreement and Arto4 of the New Zealand agreement).   The SouthAfrican agreement however does not appear to require thepassing of legislation to control meat imports;  itmerely says that if such legislation is passed, provision must he made for South African meat.   The New Zealandagreement however (Art04) may well be interpreted as requiring that the importation of meat into the UnitedKingdom shall he regulated so long as that agreement is inforce; if so it will be necessary to amend this subsectionso as to include the New Zealand agreement.on the importation of Canadian cattle into the UnitedKingdom, in accordance with Article 5 of the CanadianAgreement.ase  8.This provides for the modification of restrictionsuse 8  (3).This subsection has been inserted in accordance withthe decision of the Ottawa Legislation Committee,,
     This important clause prescribes when- anagreement is to &quot;be deemed to he in force 5 and must heread in conjunction with clauses 1 and 2 in order tounderstand when the new duties become or cease to be chargeable e     The agreements are all to be deemed to be inforce forthwith, but the duties therein provided arenot brought into force until the Treasury make anOrder under Clause 14 (8).     Au agreement ceases to be in force if theTreasury are satisfied &quot;that it has been determined in accordance with the terms thereof&quot;0  That would cover:     (a)  denunciation at the end of the prescribed period (e.g. by India after 6 months).     (b) determination as provided for in the newfoundland correspondences owing to the non-fulfilment of some special condition,,     Or an agreement may be &quot;deemed for the purposesof this Act to have ceased to be In force&quot; if theTreasury are satisfied that It is not being fulfilled.That would cover:     (a) the failure of a country to acquire thenecessary legal powers to carry out the agreement;or     (b) subsequent failure to fulfil one or more ofthe conditions of the agreement.
                  If however a country later repents and fulfils             the agreement, the Treasury are required to revoke&apos;             their former order, and the Agreement is thereupon             again deemed to he in forces                  It should he noted that,  in the opinion of             Parliamentary Counsel, complete cancellation of an             Agreement by mutual consent is not covered by the Bill             as drafted,  and, if not expressly provided for now,             would, if subsequently desired, require a Special Actose 10.             This is common form generally*   It should be noted             that under Sub-section (2) no  Resolution is required             to affirm orders fixing the dates as from which the             several duties come into operation.   Since all the             duties must have heon covered  by the Resolutions             preceding the introduction of  the Bill, a further             Resolution authorising the bringing them into force             on a particular date is unnecessary-   But if the             duties have been reduced or revoked, under Clause l(3),             and it is subsequently desired to increase or re-impose             them, a Resolution authorising the new charge is required.use 11.            Sub-clause (l) is machinery.                  Sub-clause (2).  It is necessary to make special             provision for the payment out  of moneys provided by             Parliament of the expenses incurred by the Board of
Trade, &quot;because the Bill imposes on them certainentirely new duties under clause 7 (regulation of meatimports)o   The duties imposed by the Bill on other public Departments may be regarded as an extension oftheir normal functions, and no special provisionregarding any expenses to be incurred by them is re quired0          It is :n.ly necessary to call attention to sub-section (3)0   The effect of this is that when anagreement is varied by mutual consents the Treasury canby order give effect to the variation, so long as itdoes not involve the increase of a duty beyond the rateauthorised by Schedule II ( see Clause 1 (2) and (31)).          This clause provides that no part of the Actshall come into operation until the Treasury fix aday or days for it to do so.   Thus the duties imposed by Clause 1 do not come into force automatically,but only when  the Treasury make an Order to that effect.   The clause as drafted, leaves the Treasurycomplete discretion in the choice of date; but theintention is that the duties shall come into force as soon as the Treasury is satisfied that the Govern-ment of the country concerned has acquired thenecessary power to fulfil the Agreements.,   In the casecf any Dominions which have done this before theUnited Kingdom Bill becomes law, the Order can issueimmediately.          This important clause provides that with theexception of the 10 years Tobacco preference, no partof the Act is to continue after 5 years unlessParliament otherwise determines;, i0 ec by passing a newAct-i Q
          It will ce remembered that at the  Third I lee tingof the Departmental Conference the Prime Minister laidparticular stress on the need for limiting the duration of the Act, primarily in order to safeguard the rights of the House of Commons in financial matters,.          This matter was further discussed by the ottawa Legislation Committee, whose views are recorded on page 4 of the Minutes of their firstmeeting.     Pending a final decision the sub-sectionhas been placed in square brackets0     If this sub-section were omitted the effect would be that eachof the provisions of the Bill would remain in force so long as any agreements on which that provision was dependent remained in force - but no longer.
          The Ottawa Legislation Committee at their first meeting decided that provision should he madein this Schedule for exempting cider apples from theduty on apples, since this exemption, though not expressly mentioned in the relevant agreements, v/asin fact discussed and agreed on by the delegates ofthe Dominions concerned.     No effect has been givento this decision in the present draft of the Billbecause, up to the time when the draft went to print,it had not been found possible to find any words to describe &quot;cider apples&quot; which would enable the Customsto distinguish them from other apples.     Sincethe draft was printed, however, it is understood thata form of words has been agreed between the customs and the Ministry of Agriculture, and approved bythe Chancellor of the  be chequer, and these words willbe inserted in the next draft.
