Memorandum  by the Secretary of State for                Dominion affairs     The Cabinet will like  to have a &quot;brief account of thomeeting which  the Chancellor of the Exchequer,  the Secretaryof State f*sr Foreign Affairs,  the Secretary of  State  f**r Warand I had with Mr.  De Valera and Mr.  Conor Maguire (theIrish Free State Attorney General)  on October 5th.     Mr- De Valera&apos;s  visit  arose  out  ef the latestcorrespondence  exchanged with  him (circulated t9  the  cabinet as CP. 324(52)  and to  the  Irish  Situation Committee  asI.S.0.(52) 63 and 64),  and  our talk was of a purely preliminary character in. oreler  to ascertain the kind of negotiations with Mr. Te Valera had in  mir.d,  the  date  and place of meeting etc.     It became obvious at an early stage of the discussion that Mr. De Valera was determined to^ re-opes, the wholequestion of the financial relationship between thc* IrishFree State and the United Kingdom rather than ts continuesthe argument as to the validity of the Agreements of 1925and 1926.  We felt that we should be in a good position tomeet him in a discussion of this kind as we should be. able toshow without difficulty that instoad of the financial settlement of 1925 and 1926 being a bad bargain fpr theIrish Free State it was in reality a good one for them;  inPa  554(52) alsoS.C.(&quot;52) 66)CABINET.
is other wards  that Mr. Cosgrave was able, in his negotiations with us,  to  secure a settlement of a favourable character for the Irish Free State.     Our  talk with Mr*  De Valera ended in agreement on the issue of  the following communique 2-   &quot;     A meeting took place this morning at the   Dominions Office between representatives of the   Governments of the United Kingdom and of the Irish   Free Stateo  Mr* Thomas, Mr. Chamberlain, Lord   Hailsham and Sir John Simon were present as   representing the Government of the United Kingdom;   the Irish Free State representatives v/ere Mro  Do   Valera and the Irish Free State Attorney General (Mr.   Conor Maguire, S.C.).        It was agreed to adopt the suggestion previously   made, that the question that has arisen concerning   the Irish Land Annuities should be made the subject of   negotiation between the two Governments.        In the course of the conversation, attention was   called to the fact that other sums formerly paid to the   United Kingdom were being withheld by the Irish Free   States   It was agreed that the negotiations should   cover these sums also, and that discussions should be   commenced between members of both Governments in   London if possible on Friday3 October 14thot?     Negotiations with Mro De Valera on the basis indicated above should at least remove any doubt in his mind that theUnited Kingdom Government are afraid to face the wide issue which he has raised-,.     Steps are being taken for material to be prepared showing the generous nature of the financial treatment

Mro De Valera will., I understand, send over fromDublin within the next few days a statement of the factson which the Irish Free State Government rely in supportof their general attitude on the financial question.
