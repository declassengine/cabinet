Copy So../.,.... 314(32)          NATIONALITY OF MARRIED TV0MEN .              Memorandum by the Home Secretary.      .At  its meeting; on the 1st June last, the Cabinet had under consideration a memorandum which I had submitted (C .P .162(32 )) proposing; that  further consideration should be  given tc the question of relieving British women who become aliens by marriage, of the disabilities attaching to an alien in this country,  and the Cabinet  decided (Cabinet Conclusion 30(32) Conclusion 7) that this proposal should be  examined in consultation with the Law Officers, and that the results of the investigation of the problem should be reported to the Cabinet.      In  pursuance  of this decision I have been in consultation with the Attorney-General,  and I enclose, for t :-e information of my colleagues, a copy  of a memorandum by the Attorney General  together with a copy of  a memorandum by Mr. 0. F. Dowson, Assistant  Legal /dviser  of the  Home Office, to which the Attorney-General refers.      The original  proposal was that a Bill should be introduced. relieving in general terms the women concerned from all the disqualifications  and disabilities to which an alien is subject in this  country, and  providing,  in addition, for the specific  removal of the principal disabilities (viz. disqualification for the Parliamentary and  local Government franchise; restrictions  and liabilities imposed under the Aliens Restriction Acts, 1914, and 1919,  and the Aliens Order, 1920;  ineligibility for membership of either House of Parliament and for the councils of certain Local /uthorities.)   The Attorney-General called attention to the objections in principle to the proposed legislation  hut suggested certain  modifications  in case it should he decided as a matter of policy that some action on these lines must be  t8ken.  The  Attorney- General&apos;s suggestions  were that r  woman on marriage to an alien should be required  to elect at the time of her marriage whether she
wished to continue to  exercise  the  privileges  and  discharge  theduties of a British national.   The  election,  if  in the  negative,should be final and irrevocable.    If  in  the  affirmative,  itshould be effective only  until  she  ceased to  be  resident  in  theUnited Kingdom for a period of  six  (?  nine) months in anycalendar year from January to December; in that  event&apos;a finalelection not to -exercise  the privileges and discharge the dutiesof a British national  would be  deemed  to  have  been made.     There is clearly  much force in the Attorney-General&apos;s objections to the principle of  the  proposal, but after  carefullyconsidering the problem in all  its  aspects  I have  come  t*  theconclusion that the best  course is  to  make such  amendments in ournationality law as are required to  give effect to  the proposals in the Hague Convention,  and at the  same  time  to meet the  claims of the women whose national status  will not be affected by these changes by relieving them so far as  possible of  their disabilitiesas aliens under our domestic law.     It is true that difficulties might arise, especially  in timeof war, from creating  a class of persons  who,  while remainingaliens in the eyes of  the laT^ (as they must, until Inter-Imperialagreement can be reached  for the alteration of our nationalitylaw on the subject) are not subject  to any of  the  disabilitiesof alienage.  On the other hand there  are  two  considerations whichhave not been sufficiently emphasised  in  the past.  In  the firstplace it must be remembered that the possession  of&quot; differentnationalities by husband  and wife is not  a new feature  of our law.Up to 1870 a British born woman remained  a British subjectnotwithstanding marriage  to an  alien.  Although  this was due tothe old common law principle &quot;nemo  potest  exuere patriam&apos;  (whichwas applicable to men  and women alike), and cannot  bherefore be claimed as any theoretical recognition of  the rights of women, assuch; nevertheless, so far. as I can  ascertain, no  practicaldifficulties did in fact  arise  from  the circumstances thathusband and wife possessed different nationalities.  In the second
place, Section 10 of the British Nationality and Status of aliens act, 1914, already goes some way towards recognising the principleof a different nation ality for husband and wife, by providing thata British born woman, whose husband ceases to be a British subjectduring toe continuance of the marriage, may retain Britishnstionality on making a declaration that she so desires.  So faras I am aware, although the number of women affected is not, ofcourse, very large, here again none of the practical difficultieswhich have been urged in opposition to the proposal involvingdifferent nationality for husband and wife in certain cases have occurred as the result  of this provision in the law.     I agree with the Attorney-General that the woman in question should not automatically retain the privileges of British subjectsbut should be required to elect at the time of marriage whetherthey desire to retain the privileges and also discharge the dutiesof British subjects in the United Kingdom.  I think, however, thatthe effect of the election once made should be final and should notbe made subject to any condition as to residence.  The impositionof any such condition besides rendering the Government proposalsunacceptable to the ^omen&apos;s Organisations, would involve seriouspractical difficulties.  In order to ascertain whether a particularwoman was entitled to exercise the rights and privileges conferred,it would be necessary in each case to prove the negativeproposition that she had not in any year subsequent to suchelection been resident  out of the United Kingdom for more than the specified period.  This would obviously be a matter of considerabledifficulty and in many  cases it might be impossible for the womanto produce any proof at all.  These points become of special importance when one considers how the scheme could be applied inthe case of the mast important right of all, that of the franchise.  The Registration Officer would have to decide whetherthe woman was entitled to be placed on the register notwithstanding that she was an alien.  She might have been resident in the UnitedKingdom during the three months&apos; qualifying period under the
HOME  OFFICE?     23rd  September,  1932.Election Law and nevertheless not he entitled to be registered ssa voter because she had during some previous period not been resident in the United Kingdom; and, the Registration Officer mightnot he able to obtain any satisfactory evidence one way or theother.  Moreover, the effect of the condition would be that, inaddition to the ordinary qualification for registration PS a voteras established under the general lav, the class of women concerned would be required to fulfil r special qualification as toresidence, i .e. they would have to continue to be resident in theUnited Kingdom during a period of at least six months each year,     I feel strongly that British-born women should be entitled, ifthey so elect, to retain the privileges of British subjects so faras our domestic law is concerned, and I do not think that inpractice it is at all likely that they would be found to exerciseprivileges, even if they desired to do so, in circumstances whichmight arouse public antagonism.     The Attorney-General, to whom I showed a copy of thismemorandum in draft, informs me that, pending inter-Imperialagreement on the alteration of our nationality law, he concurs inmy proposals as the best way to meet the existing difficulties.     I should be glad to obtain the authority of the Cabinet forthe preparation of a Bill on these lines .                                    H, S.
        DI^AB^ITrBS OP&apos; BHITIbHyWOMBW; ALIENS 3Y kARRIAGE .              Meniorandun by trie Attorney-General.     The Home Secretary by letter dated 0&quot;une 14th, 1932,informed me that the Cabinet desired him to explore in con-sultation with the Law Officers the question whether Britishwomen who have became aliens by marriage should be relieved of the disabilities attaching to an alien in this country.He therefore asked me to give him my advice in order that he might be in a position to bring the matter again befure theCabinet.   I have had the advantage of reading a memorandum prepared by Mr. 0. p. Dowson, one of the Assistant Legal advisers to the Home Office.     The rule by which the nationality of a married woman followsthe nationality of her husband has a statutory origin.   Therewere tv/o stages in the enactment of the rule.   In 1844 it wasenacted that an alien woman acquired British nationality onmarrying a British subject and in 1G70 the converse position was declared in the Naturalisation Act; so that from that time aBritish woman who married a foreigner acquired his nationality.     Broadly speaking the rule by which the nationality of a woman followed that of her husband prevailed In all othercountries with a few exceptions during the present century^ downto the end of the Great War.   A notable e;-;ce,.-tion to the general rule was found in the case of New Zealand.     The law with regard to the national status of married womenis now declared In the British Nationality and Status of Aliens.,ct, 1914, as amended by the Acts of 1913 and 1922.   Bysection 10    the above stated general rule was laid down subjecthowever to two provisoes.   The first proviso allows the wife  ofa man who during marriage ceases to be a British  subject toremain a British subject if she so declares.   The second provisoallows a British-Lorn woman whose husband  is an alien and subject
                                                                ft tt                                                                80                            - 2 . - ^  .to a state of war with. His Lajesty to receive a certificate ofnaturalisation if she so desires and the Home Secretary is satis-fied that it is desirable.     Since 1918 there has been a number of modifications in othercountries of the general rule.   The South American Republicsnever adopted the rule which had become practically universal inEurope and North America.   In 1918 Russia gave married women thesame rights as to nationality as men.   The United States ofAmerica, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, France and Turkey areamong the nations which at various dates between 1922 and 1929modified the general rule.   In the cases of France,  Sweden,Norway and Denmark, the right of a married woman to retain her ownnationality was made dependent on permanent residence in her own country.     The confusion resulting from a great diversity of laws onthis subject naturally attracted attention.   The Hague Conferenceof 1930 resulted in a Convention on questions relating to the con-conflict of Nationality laws, with a view to abolishing all casesboth of statelessness and of double nationality.   Chapter IIIArticles 3-11, dealt with the Nationality of Carried women.Articles 3 and 9 prescribed the acquisition of the husband&apos;snationality as the condition of the loss by the wife of her ownnationality.   Article 10 declared that a wife should not changeher nationality against her will merely because the husband becamenaturalised and Article 11 dealt with the recovery by a woman whosemarriage was dissolved, of her pre-marriage nationality.   It willbe  seen that the agreement contained in the Convention was of avery partial and tentative nature, and it  seems likely that therewill be great difficulty  in framing any legislation to give effectto  the  Convention  in  this country.     The desirability  of  a uniform law within  the Empire had caused  New  Zealand to  bring herself  into  line  with  the  rest of  theEmpire  by abolishing  the  right of  a  woman to retain her British
                                                             o n                                                             O (                           - 3 -nationality notwithstanding marriage to an alien.   The ImperialConference of 1926 adopted the recommendation of a Committeeappointed to consider certain questions of nationality, includingthe nationality of married women.   The Committee was unable toreach a unanimous conclusion, except that they attached greatimportance to the maintenance of uniformity in the Empire in thelaw relating to British Nationality, and recommended postponement of further consideration until the Committee to consider the-operation .of Dominion legislation had reported.     The deliberations of the last mentioned Committee took placein 1929.   No definite recommendations were made beyond adeclaration that for the purpose of conferring on any person a status to be operative throughout the Commonwealth legislationbased on common agreement would be essential.     Lastly the Imperial Conference of 1930 was unable to makeany recommendation for the substantive amendment of the law withregard to the nationality of married women.   The Conferenceassumed that all the members of the Commonwealth represented atthe Hague Conference of 1930 having signed the Convention would introduce legislation accordingly.     I have set out the foregoing facts with reference to thequestion of status although the question  I am asked to consider isthe more limited one as to relieving British women who havemarried aliens of the disabilities attaching to an alien in thiscountry.   I appreciate that it is not proposed at present tointroduce legislation which if the reports of the two  imperial conferences of 1926 and 1930 are to be followed will require agree-oent between the various members of the Commonwealth.   At  the  sametime it seems to me of very doubtful wisdom to create  a class ofpersons who while remaining aliens  suffer none of the  disabilitiesof alienage in the United  Kingdom.   The  most pointed  illustrationof the  anomalous  character of  this proposal  is probably to  befound  in  the suggestion  that a person  in  this  class may actuallybecome  a  member of the Privy Council.   The Bill  which was  introduced
                          -   -by Captain Cazalet and received a First Reading on duly 6th, 1932,proceeded along the lines of this proposal, and Captain Gazaletin his speech claimed that the Bill was of &quot;purely local and domestic application1&apos;.   This is of course true in strict law,but it seems to me hardly disputable that it is really an indirectway of altering in the united Kingdom the national status of a married woman coming within its provisions.     The inconvenience of legislation on these lines may bebetter appreciated in connection with the question raised byMr. Lowson in his memorandum as to making the women concernedsubject to the &quot;obligations, duties and liabilities&quot; of a british subject.   The position of women who are aliens in lav/ ana yetsuffer none of the disabilities of aliens in the United kingdom would be still more anomalous if they were not to be subject tothe obligations, duties and liabilities of a British subject.Apart from what, I anticipate, would be popular feeling on thispoint I think it would be a serious blemish in the law, if therewere a class of persons entitled for instance to vote at parliamentary or local government elections, to sit in the Houseof Commons, and generally to enjoy all the franchises and privileges of a natural born British subject and yet not to be under any of the duties incident to British nationality in theUnited Kingdom.   Mr. Dowson visualises the position of the womenconcerned to be that of persons who may from time to time andas often as they like while remaining aliens opt themselves intothe privileged position of a British subject.     In my opinion this is most undesirable although I recognise.it is more a question of pure politics than of law.   If theproposal is to be adopted, I agree in general with Mr. Dowson&apos;smethod of drafting namely to include in the Bill a general clauserelieving the women  concerned of all disabilities and alsoclauses dealing with specific disabilities.   I see no reason  atall why the Glauses  should not., be retrospective, that is to say,applicable to women who have married before the passing of theAct.   The new privileges are exercisable only in future   they do
SBnot carry with them any binding change  of status,  and I see  noobjection to giving the proposed privileges to  women alreadymarried if it is proposed to give them to women who marry afterthe passing of the Act.     I have m: de plain my objections in principle to the creationof a special class of aliens.   I think the objections would  bevery formidable if war should break out between Great Britain andany of the nations of one of which women, affected by the proposed legislation -would continue to become or to be nationals.   I  donot see how it would be possible to avoid ad hoc legislation todeal with persons who being enemy aliens would be in the enjoyment of any of the privileges they chose to exercise of a british national.     If it is thought necessary to legislate for the women inquestion, while being  impossible in the light of the Dominion Gon-ference to give them a British nationality either automaticallyor at their option, I  should  orefer a different method.   I wouldrequire every woman to elect at the time of her marriage whethershe wished to continue to exercise the privileges and discharge the duties of a British national and to make the election if in the negative final and irrevocable, and if in the affirmative,effective only until she ceased to be resident  in the UnitedKingdom for a period of six  (?nine) months in any calendar year from January  to December, upon which even a final election notto exercise the privileges and discharge  the duties  of  a british national would be  deemed to have been made.     This method  is  still  to  some  extent  open  to the  objection that it provides  for the creation  of a special  class  of aliens.Its advantage however in  my judgment  is  that  while  it  gives  thewomen  concerned  some voice  as to  the effect  of  the  change of  statusconsequent  on marriage it  does  not allow them  to claim special privileges  as and when they like  without  due responsibilities.
t90NATIONALITY  01?  MARRIiUD  v/OMSN.Memorandum by Mr. 0. P. Dowson.      I have  been  asked  by  the  Secretary  of  State  to  examine  theproposal  that British women who have  become  aliens by marriageshould be relieved  of all  disabilities of an alien in the UnitedKingdom;  and to  advise as to  the  best way  of  carrying  out thisproposal.      The most important disabilities, etc.  to  which  aliens are subject in the United Kingdom  are  ineligibility for  the privy council, ior membership of either House  of Parliament,  and forthe councils of certain local  authorities;   disqualification forthe parliamentary and local government franchise;  therestrictions and liabilities imposed under the AliensRestriction Acts, 1914 and 1919, and the Aliens Order,  1920;disqualification for appointment in the Civil  Service;  and forownership of a British ship or any share in  a  British ship.There are also certain other minor disabilities andrestrictions v^hich will require consideration.   The following isa brief statement of the particulars (so far as material for present purposes)  of the laws relating to the various  disabilities andrestrictions.   1.  Disqualification for membership of the Privy Council andthe House of Lords and for election as a member of the House ofCommons.     From the earliest times an alien has been incapable of        ,being elected to Parliament;    the disqualification being basedupon  the  oommon law.   The existing disqualification for membership of either House of Parliament and oi the Privy Councilrests on s.3 of the Act of Settlement, 1700  (12 &amp; 13 william IIIoJ3.
The material part of that section as amended by the british nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914, is as follows:        &quot;3 ... No person born out of the kingdoms of England     Scotland or Ireland or the dominions thereunto belonging     although he be made a denizen (except such as are born of     English parents) shall be capable to be ... a member of     either House of parliament ...&quot;At present, notwithstanding the Sex Disqualification (Removal)Act, 1919, a peeress in her own right does not receive a writ ofsummons to the House of Lords, the Committee for Privilegeshaving rejected in 1922 Lady Rhondda&apos;s petition claiming that shewas entitled by virtue of that Act to receive the writ.   This isa matter for the House of Lords to determine;  and, in themeantime, it would not be appropriate to include in the present proposal any provision affecting the position of a peeress in her own right in the unlikely event of her marrying an alien.   It maybe mentioned, however, that she would not forfeit her peeragemerely because she became an alien and she might (if the present proposal becomes law) claim to be as eligible-ior summons to theHouse of Lords as any other peeress in her own right.   2.  Disqualification for membership of local authorities.      Under the Local Government Act, 1894, s.46(l), aliens areexpressly disqualified from being members of urban or rumldistrict councils, parish councils, and metropolitan borough councils .,   There is no express and explicit statutorydisqualification in the case of county councils and borough councils outside London.   It is arguable that, having regardto the  provisions contained in certain enactments, includingthe County and Borough Councils Qualification Act, 1914, an alien may not be eligible for election to these bodies.A separate note on this difficult question is available if required.   3.  Pranohise.      The Representation of the people Act, 1918,  s.9(3),
provides that a person shall not be entitled to be registeredor to vote as a parliamentary or local government elector if heis not a British subject.   4. Aliens Restriction Acts and the Aliens Order, 1920. .      The most important restrictions and requirements under this heading are those imposed by the Aliens Order, including(i) prohibition from landing in the United Kingdom without tholeave of an Immigration Oj.i&quot;icer;  (ii) tho requirement that everyalien shall register with the police  after a certain short periodof residence in the United Kingdom;  (iii) liability todeportation.   The Secretary of State has power to exempt anyalien or class of aliens from any or all of the provisions of theOrder.      Civil Service:   Section 6 of the Aliens Restriction(Amendment) Act, 1919, provides that after the passing of the Actno alien shall be appointed to any office or place in the SivilService of the State.   It is to be observed that married women are not eligible as candidates for established situations in theGivil Service - (regulations made by the Civil ServiceCommissioners under the Order in Council of 22nd July, 1920);and women are required to resign their appointments on marriage,subject to special exceptions which may be made on therecommendation of the head oi the Department concerned.      Juries:  Section 8 of the Act of 1919 provides that noalien shall sit upon a jury in any judicial or other proceedingsif challenged by any part\  to such proceedings.      Change of name:  Section 7 of the Act of 1919 puts certainrestrictions upon aliens as regards change of name.   TooSecretary of State has power to grant exemptions irom these restrictions In cases where special grounds are shown(see s.7(&apos;J)).   The assumption or use by a married woman of her husband&apos;&amp; name is not a change of name for the purpose of thissection.
     Sections 4 and 5 of the Act of 1919 prohibit the employmentof aliens as pilots and in certain capacities on merchant ships.These employments are not presumably at present open to women,whether married or unmarried.   5.  Ownership of a British ship.       The Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, s.l, provides that a shipshall not be deemed to be a British ship unless owned wholly by persons ... qualified to be owners of British ships, vib. (a)natural born British subjects, (b)  persons naturalized by or inpursuance of an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom, or by orin pursuance oi an Act or ordnance of the proper legislative authority in a British possession.   6.   bills Act,  1861.         Under this Act every will made out of England by a british subject,  wherever domiciled,  is valid if made according to theform required by the place where it is made or oi the domicilor of  the part of the British Empire where the testator had hisdomicil of origin.   7.  Priests in the Church of England.        An alien appears to be disqualified from being ordainedas a priest in the  Church of  England (14 Car.II 0.4;13 Eliz.  c.12) .   &quot;Women,  though not apparently subject to any &apos;statutory disqualification, are not ordained as priests.   8.   Companies Act,  1917.         Under the  Companies  (particulars of Directorsj  Act, 1917,the nationality of  the Directors of a company, if net British,is to  be  stated on  all business letters and other communications,circulars, etc.   9.   Income Tax.        Under the  Income  Tax  Act, 1916, there are certainexemptions in favour of British subjects not ordinarily resident
in the United Kingdom (see Schedule I:   Rules applicable  to cases IV and V).      (It may he  mentioned that  under the  National HealthInsurance and Unemployment Insurance acts  and Widows and  Orphansand Old Ago  Pensions Act,  1925,  aliens  arc in the same  positionr-,s 3r i t i sh sub j e c t s .)      The above list,  though probably not exhaustive,  is thought to cover all cases of  any practical importance.   As already indicated,  some of the disqualifications mentioned relate tooffices or hinds of employment in which either \-yomen generally ormarried women are not  appointed or employed.    It appears,  however,to be  necessary to consider for the purposes  of  the contemplatedlegislation all the disabilities and disqualifications to which an alien  is subject and to make provision for the non-application ofthose  disabilities and disqualifications in the  case of Britishwomen  in the United Kingdom who were British  before marriage andwho have lost their British nationality by marriage to an alien.      The Question arises as to what is the best method of giving effect to the proposal which has been admitted lor iurtherconsideration by the Cabinet.   Two methods appear to  be possible,either separately or in combination:       (l)  A general clause  providing in efxect  that a woman whowould, but  for her marriage with an alien, be a  British subject, hall  not in the United Kingdom for the purpose  of any law for thetiae being in force therein be deemed to be an alien.       (2)  To specify  each enactment relating to aliens as suchand to provide that women who have ceased to  be  British subjectsby reason of marriage  to an alien shall not be treated as aliensfor the purposes of that enactment.         AS regards (2), there is a statutory precedent for sucha provision in s.3(l)  of the Old Ago fension Act, 1911, as amended
by s.2 of the Old Age Pension Act, 1919.   It may be explainedthat as regards nationality tho conditions for eligibility for anold age pension are laid down in-s.2(2) of the principal Act (theOld Age Pension Act, 1908, as amenderl).   The recipient of an old age pension must have been a British subject for at least 12 years before the date of receipt of any pension or, if not a naturalborn British subject,&apos;20 years.   Section 3(1) of the Act of 1911provides that &quot;the conditions as to nationality imposed by paragraph (2) of section 2 of the -a-ct of 1908 shall not borequired to be fulfilled in the case of a woman who satisfiedthe pension authorities that she would but for her marriage withan alien have fulfilled that condition&quot;.        It may fee doubted whether a single clause containing a general provision on the lines indicated in (1) above would besufficient.    Doubt might arise as to the effect of such ageneral provision in its application to particular enactments orto the common law.   Por example?,  their application to the caseof eligibility for election to the House of Commons might perhapsgive rise to difficulty having regard to the curious phraseologyof s.3 of the Aot of Settlement.   Moreover, while some general provision of this kind seems necessary in order to cover theground, it is obviously desirable that there should be something.on the face  of the proposed legislation to show what are at anyrate the more important advantages which the women concerned will.secure.   It is suggested, therefore, that, in addition to ageneral clause, clauses should be inserted in the Bill referringspecifically to the principal disabilities, disqualifications, orrestrictions to which aliens are subject, and it should beprovided in  each case that the disability, discjualificatioh, or restriction (as the case  may be J  shall not apply to a woman whowould but for her marriage with an alien have been a british subject.       I suggest that the proposed legislation might be in theform of clauses on the lines of the attached draft.
ho     Two points remain for consideration, viz:        (a) whether the relief from disabilities should be            retrospective so as to apply to British born women who            have married aliens before the date of commencement            of the new Act as well as those married after that date.        (b) whether, if a general clause on the lines I have            suggested is adopted, it should contain a provision            making the women concerned subject to the obligations.            duties and liabilities of a British subject.As regards (aj, this is mainly a question of policy, but I assume that it is not the intention of the Cabinet that the proposed Actshould be retrospective:  see alternative words suggested In brackets in clause 3.       AS regards (o), see words in brackets in clause 1.       If Biitish women who marry aliens are to be exempt fromthe disabilities of alienage, it might appear only reasonable thatthey should be subject to the same obligations, duties, and liabilities as a British subject.   3ut it is for consideration whether it is right in principle and also within the scope of theproposal that the Bill should impose duties and liabilities *A married woman to whom tho proposed legislation will apply wouldnot be able at any time during the continuance of the marriage to escape, by naturalization abroad or in any other way, from any liability to which she might be exposed by such a provision;  while,on the other hand, the exercise of the privileges conferred would obviously be optional.   On the whole, it is suggested that thowords in brackets in clause 1 should not be included.                       (sgd.)  0. F. DOWSON.                                 7th June, IS32.
