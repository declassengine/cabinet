This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet, October, 1932.SECRET.                                                                    Corr NO. 9CP.  327 (32).THE CABINET.THE   SINGAPORE  BASE.      MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY  OF  STATE FOR WAR.    I circulate for the consideration of my colleagues a memorandum by the Chief  ofthe Imperial General Staff regarding the Singapore Base.                                                                         H.  THE WAR OFFICE,       3rd  October, 1932.MEMORANDUM BY THE CHIEF OF THE  IMPERIAL GENERAL  STAFF.    1. As  soon as  the approval of the  Cabinet is given to the  Report of  the coast defence Sub-Committee (C.I.D.  Paper  No 186 A), the problem will arise of the best means by which the recommendations contained in the Report can be implemented.    2. It  is proposed that the first step should be  the installation of  the  armamentcomprising the &quot;first stage&quot; of&quot;the defence scheme for Singapore (recommendation (c)).In view of the decision made in 1930 (C.I.D. Paper No. 354 C) that all work on the defences of  this port should be  postponed until 1935, when the situation would again be reviewed, a  Cabinet decision is required  if  the work  is to be resumed.   assuming that the Cabinet agrees that the work should be put in hand at once, then provision ofthe necessary money must be considered.  Two points must be made clear with regardto the provision of this money :     (a) The  necessary  money  cannot  be  found  by  economies  in any  Army           expenditure  in other directions.  Indeed, if  the modernization  of  the           armament of our  coast defences  is  not to be made at the expense of the           efficiency of other military departments, special provision under the Vote           is required over and above all  normal expenditure and in addition to money           to  replace last year&apos;s reductions.    (b) The  money  must be  assured for a  considerable  number  of  years.  If  the           modernization of our coast defences is to be carried through efficiently  and           economically, then it must be carried out on a long-time  programme.   For           instance, two 15-inch guns may take 4 years to manufacture and 1 year to           instal ;  consequently, unless special provision can be ensured for a period           of 5 years, the production of two 15-inch guns cannot economically be put           in  hand.    3. The completion of the first  stage of  the defences of  Singapore is estimated to cost  800,000  for  the provision  and installation of armament ; in addition,  certaincontingent  works services such as railways, roads, and barrack and store accommodation,which  are  difficult  to assess, will add to this total.  In  order to cover these it isproposed to include  an additional  600,000.   For the implementation of the Report,then, as far as  Singapore is concerned, special provision must be made  for approximately .1,400,000, and this sum might suitably be spread  over 5 years at the rate of about 120,000 for the first year and   325,000 for the remaining 4 years.

                                        2                                          I    4. It must, of course, be borne  in  mind that the whole problem of obtaining an up-to-date and  adequate standard of  defence at  all our defended ports at home andabroad in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee of  Imperial defence will involve a continuous programme for  a  considerable number of  years.  Of  these ports, Singapore is the highest in order of priority.    5. To summarize our immediate requirements :     (a)  A  Cabinet  decision authorizing  the resumption of work on the Singapore            defences is needed.    (b)  Special  provision  under the  Army  Vote is required  over and above  the            provision that is normally made  for Army expenditure.     (c)  This special provision  should amount to  about  120,000  for 1933, and to            about  325,000 a year for the following 4 years.
