^DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY *3 GOVERNMENT.,3C5  (32),                                          COPY NO.    S                                CABINET.                          EXPORT CREDITS FOR RUSSIA.                 Note by the President of the Board of Trade.             For the information of ay colleagues I circulate a copy        of the Report which was made to the Chancellor of the        Exchequer and myself by the Export Credits Guarantee        Department in accordance with the decision reached by the        Cabinet on the 27th August.             It will be seen that the Export Credits Advisory        Committee met with Borne difficulty in giving effect to the        proviso that of the  1,450,000 of additional credits for        Russia which they were authorised to guarantee up to the end        of the present year, a substantial proportion should be in      - respect of credits not exceeding 12 months.   The Committee        recommended in effect that this proviso should be&quot;&quot;waived and        that they should be given discretion to obtain the best        terms possible, provided always that the length of credit        covered by the guarantees should not in any case exceed 18        months.             After consulting the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the        Prime Minister, I asked the Committee to proceed at their        discretion in the manner proposed.             In view of the very wide publicity which this matter has        obtained in the press, I think it is desirable to add that        the Export Credits Guarantee Department have strictly adhered        to the cabinet&apos;s instructions of the 4th August that no        announcement should be made.   It was not to be expected that
the  recent decision could remain entirely secret:  the publicity which in fact it received is evidently a measureof the public interest which the question of trade withRussia arouses.                                           W.R.Board of Trade,   19th September, 1932.
SJ^CRFT.                      EXPORT CREDITS FOR RUS8IA.          Report to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the               President of the Board of Trade by the                Export Credits Guarantee Department,   1, The present position in regard to Export Credits fcrRussia is that on the 4th August the Cabinet authorised theExport Credits Guarantee Department to guarantee  1,800,000of additional credits of not more than 18 months providedthat a substantial proportion was at 12 months and a further 250,000 in credits not exceeding 9 months.   It was anessential condition of this decision that no announcement should be made.   2, Up to the present no use has been made of this authority as the Russian representatives have Maintained that they areunable to place orders on less than 18 months&apos; credit.     Strong protests have recently been addressed to the PrimeMinister and other Ministers that owing to the refusal of theDepartment to give further guarantees Russian orders are beinglost and men thrown out of employment.   Such protests are thenatural outcome of the slowing down policy pursued by theGovernment in regard to credits for Russia during the lastnine months.   Complaints from the industrial constituencieshave recently increased considerably,   3, The effect of the recent policy is seen from a comparison of the amount of Russian business facilitated bythe Department in 1931 and 1932.   In 1931 the total was 8,500,000 and a further  1,100,000 of exports in 1932 was authorised under the programme approved in the summer of1931.   The new businees approved in 1932 is unlikely to exceed 53,600,000 and a fair part of this will not be shippeduntil next year.
   4, The immediate difficulty has arisen from the AdvisoryCommittee&apos;a endeavour to ensure the fulfilment of thecondition that a substantial proportion of the creditsauthorised by the Cabinet on 4th August shall be of notmore than 12 months duration.     This involves a good deal of negotiation between theDepartment, exporters and the Soviet Representatives.These negotiations are still being carried on but theAdvisory Committee ore satisfied that it will not, at anyrnte for the present, be possible for British manufacturers to secure Russian orders for any substantial amount on thebasis of 12 months credit or less,   5, It appears to the Committee that:-     (a) The Russian Government can obtain the credits they           require in Germany on terms which are rarely less           than 19^ months average.     (b) The Russian Government has large amounts of bills           maturing (in this country, Germany etc.) weekly           over the next two years or so.   They maintain           that these maturities are so spaced as to make           it impracticable for them to undertake further           obligations of any large amount at 12 months           credit.   The Committee believe the Russian           statement to be substantially correct.   Russia&apos;s           sole source of income is from her exports of           goods.   If the Ottawa Conference should result in           any serious diminution of Russia&apos;s income from           snles to this country, the Russian argument will           be strengthened.   6. The Committee would be prepared (on the conditions whichthey normally impose) to recommend the guaranteeing of creditsof 15 and 18 months,  seeing that the goods which the Russians
propose  to  order  this year  are  almost entirely of the heavier  types.    At  the  same time they would reduce  eventhese  periods of  credit  if  in their judgment they could do so without  causing the  Russians to divert orders to Germany,They have always  urged that credits should he kept as shortas possible so as to obtain the maximum  turnover within anylimit  of total commitment on Russia that may be determinedfrom time to time.   They also  attach great importance tothe continuance of their policy of accumulating as large asum as possible out  of premiums.   This  sum now stands at approximately  1,250,000 against a liability of some 7,000,000  (i*e,,, 70f  of bills  for  10,000,000).   If thepresent  authority for  1,450,000 is used between now and the31st December next the liability at the  latter date should still  be about  7,000,000 as bills for  1,500,000 are due to run off  in  the meantime, but a  further  125,000 or so shouldbe obtained by way of premium.   7.  The Committee  cannot  resist the conclusion thet thepresent  difficulty would have been much  less acute if greatercontinuity  in regard to  Russian business had been possible.They recall that  last April they made a  definite recommendation that they should be  authorised  to guarantee additional creditsamounting to  4,000,000  during  the six months ending on the30th September.   This proposal was accepted by the Presidentof the Board of Trade and put to the Cabinet,   In theabsence  of  the Chancellor of th^ Exchequer it was,  however,decided  early in May that the Department should not guaranteemore than  1,600,000, i.e.,  the amount of Russian creditsmaturing during the  same period.   This  amount was allocatedby the end  of June and protests naturally arose.   But theDepartment  was unable to consider any further business until
on the 4th August a further allocation of  1,450,000 was authorised by the Cabinet.   In the meantime orders were undoubtedly transferred to Germany, and when this allocationmade it possible to consider further applications, newterms of credit acceptable both to the Russians and theCommittee had still to be worked out.   It is these negotiations which h^ve prevented the Department fromoffering any facilities of which exporters could avail themselves.   8. The Committee, who have again been consulted, arehopeful that some compromise involving no very substantialdeparture from the conditions imposed by the Cabinet on the4th August can be found,   To ensure success they ask fordiscretion to obtain the best terms possible in disposing ofthe latest allocation of  1,450,000 made available by theCabinet, provided always that the length of credit shall inno case exceed 18 months.     In making this recommendation they have taken intoaccount the possibility th^t Russian sales in this country may suffer some diminution if the Temporary commercial agreement should be terminated, but they assume that forthe next 18 months or so such diminution will not be on a drastic scale.     Whatever decision is reached must, the Committee presume,be subject to the Cabinet&apos;s decision that no announcement isto be made.   No doubt nny decision will be followed byprotests from manufacturers.   The Committee suggest that,as in the past,  individual firms be referred to them.
