DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOvERNMENT.) RET.302 (52)COPY NO.CABINET.POLICE  PAY.     The accompanying copy of a letter dated September13th, which has been addressed to the Prime Minister bythe Home Secretary, is circulated to the Cabinet by direction of the Prime Minister in accordance with therequest contained in the last paragraph of the HomeSecretary&apos;s letter.     The Secretary of State for Scotland has statedthat he desires to be associated with the Home Secretary&apos;sletter.                     (Signed) M.P.A. HANKEY.                           Secretary-, Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens. S.W. 1.,         September 15th, 1932.
                                     HOME OFFICE, S.W.  1.,                                        13th September, 1932.Dear Prime Minister,     After consideration of yesterday&apos;s discussion of thePolice Pay question I feel bound again to express the conviction, which I stated then, that the Government will betalcing a wrong course if, in determining the amount of thesecond instalment of the cut in pay, they do not take intoaccount the special economies that have been effected inpolice expenditure during the last twelve months.     I would remind you that these economies have been made,both in London and by Police Authorities throughout GreatBritain, at the invitation of the Home Office and scottish office on the assurance that they would be the means ofdiminishing pro tanto the call to be made upon the members ofthe Police Force, and with that object.     With regard to the suggestion that my colleagues didnot realise the course that was being pursued in this matter,I would again refer to the White Paperf which was passed bythe Treasury and discussed for days in Parliament, and which,having stated in so many words that such economies would betaken into account, consequently held in reserve for furtherconsideration what the amount of the second instalment of the cut would be.   Sir Warren Fisher laid great emphasisyesterday on the fact that your own statement in Parliament,that the cuts should be &quot;limited to not more than 10 percent.&quot; was made on September 21st, 1931, after the issue ofthe White Paper and must be taken as superseding it;* See Cmd.  39528 of 1931.
*  CP. 290 (32).further that it  implied that the cuts in question would&quot;be 10 per cent,  all round and not less.   I had not the dates &quot;before me  yesterday, hut I now find that it was four days after that, on September 25th, that I made the state-in en t in the House of Commons which was quoted in theCabinet Memorandum of August 23rd, 1932 -            &quot;Furthermore the Home Office and the Police         Council agreed that instead of the whole of these         economies fal ling upon the pay of the various         ranks of the force, as much as possible should         be effected by administrative economies.&quot;You have mentioned that you were present when this statement was made, and many other members of the Government werepresent also.    I venture to suggest that if excerjtion w asto be taken to the course proposed, it should have been a that time, and not several months later after the announcedpolicy of making economies in order to diminish the cuts had long been put into effect throughout the country.     I do not at all share the very grave apprehensionsexpressed by representatives of the other Departments.  Thatthere will be some grumbling among the men of the defence services, and among the Post Office servants and the teachers,is very probable.   But if the Government announcement made it plain that the course taken was in accordance with a pledge given last year, and was no new decision, I cannotbelieve that any extreme action would be taken in any quarter.   So far as the staff organisations are concerned,they have always attached the greatest weight to thescrupulous fulfilment of any assurances given to them onbehalf of the  Government, and they are not likely tosuggest that this pledge ought to be dishonoured.   Andin view of the present state of the national finances,
 they will not for a moment expect  that  the  pay which they are at present receiving should  be increased by a restoration of part of the cut made last year.      On the other hand,  while the  others are  only indirectly concerned, the police are concerned immediately and directly. There has been no active agitation among them of late because I  have refused sanction for the holding of  &quot;open meetings&quot;. The  statute which authorised the formation  of the Police Federation does not require that sanction should be given  to such meetings,  but they have often been permitted in the past; the  Police Federation have protested  against  the present refusalj   such meetings cannot be  prohibited  after  the Government&apos;s decision is announced.   Even  a  further cut of 2-g- per cent,  will evoke strong protests;  if  a cut  of 5 per cent,  is  made,  in direct contravention  of assurances given by the  Government,  not only repeatedly through the mouths of  the responsible  Ministers,  but also with  the  endorsement of an official  White  Paper presented to  Parliament,  the sense of grievance cannot fail to be intense.     Lastly,  I  am bound to observe that the matter  was discussed at great length at the last meeting of the Cabinet, and  that,  after the views had been expressed  of several of our colleagues,  who were quite impartial  in the matter, the Cabinet refrained from  deciding that the second instalment  of the cut  should be  the  same  as the first.    The  Conclusion reached was  as  follows:-*          (a)  To accept  a proposal that the Home Secretary              and  the Secretary of State  for  Scotland, in              the  light  of the  discussion^  should now prepare              a definite scheme  for the solution of the              difficulty and should discuss it  with the              Treasury. *  Reference Cabinet  46  (32)  Conclusion 7.                              3.
            (b)  That their scheme should he submitted to the                 Prime Minister with a view to circulation to                 the  Cabinet, and if they encountered                 unsurmountable difficulties they should                 report them to the Prime Minister who should                 consider how they would be dealt with.The collection of the necessary figures from 230 authorities,their examination and the decision on each one of the savings of expenditure made this year, whether it should properly beincluded in this calculation or not, has been a complicated and not an easy task.   The outcome has been the paper sentto you on September 9th by the Secretary for Scotland and myself.    This indicates that the second instalment of the cut, account being taken of the economies, should be 2-g- per     Sir Russel Scott, on my behalf, immediately after thelast Cabinet, communicated &quot;with the Secretary to the Treasurywith a view to s eeing if any accommodation was possible, as suggested in  the Cabinet conclusion.   He was informed thatthe Treasury would not agree to any modification whatever ofthe 10 per cent, cut, and that this was also the view of theService Departments.   This made it impossible to enter upon any discussion.     The matter was left by the  Cabinet in your hands, but ifthe decision is that the assurances given are to be over-ridden on the ground of the financial exigencies of the presenttime, I should be grateful if you would cause this letter tobe circulated to the Cabinet.                        Yours sincerely,                          (Signed) HERBERT SAMUEL.The Right Honourable         J.  Ramsay MacDonald, M.P.
