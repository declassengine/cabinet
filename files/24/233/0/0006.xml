INTERIM REPORT.1.       &quot;&apos;e were appointed by the Prime Minister onSeptember 29th, 1932 with the following terms ofreference:-        To enquire into means for dealing with    the unemployed, -especially by way of finding    for them employment or occupation, in addition    to, or as an alternative for,  cash payments.2.      At our first Meeting we were asked &quot;by thePrime Minister to give immediate and urgent considera-tion to proposals directed to the amelioration of the lot of the unemployed which had been placed before himby the Minister of Health.   &apos;.Ve have now examined theseproposals and been able to reach certain agreed conclu-sions regarding them, which are embodied in the followinginterim report.   In deciding to present this interimreport at once we have been actuated by the consideration that if anything is to be achieved this winter along thelines indicated, it is necessary that immediate effect begiven to our proposals, or such modification of them asthe Cabinet may approve.               \
J^.7frl\L QQ-TSIUSHAVIOrTS.3.     The Minister of Health in his memorandum&apos;? haspoints a out that while the policy of the Government isrightly directed to conserving the capital resourcesof the nation for  tne revival of induatry and employmentin their normal channels, there is meanwhile graveoanger to the stability ana prosperity of the country inthe heavy and widespread unemployment ;.which is now being experienced, with  the inevitable deterioration of personalskill, physique and morale which it involves.    As a wayof escape from this dilemma the Minister has suggestedthat the voluntary movement for providing the unemployedwith useful forms  of occupation might be expanded underthe aegis of Local Authorities at little capital cost tothe nation.       we share to the full the Minister&apos;s anxiety re-garding the effects of prolonged unemployment on thoseexperiencing it.   Te would point out that beyond its immediate effects  on those concerned the deteriorationinvolved is bound  to be a source of serious weakness tothe country1s competitive power when an opportunity forthe resumption of  normal industrial activity arises.   Ifways can be found  of occupying usefully the minds and bodies of the unemployed we feel that even substantialexpenditure on this head would be a sound national invest-in ent.       The problem presented is a formidable one.   Thereare at present approximately 2,858,000 persons registered as unemployed, of  whom 2,303,000 are men over 18 years ofage.    Of these, it is known that at least 711,000 havebeen continuously  unemployed for six months or more, and403,000 for more than a year.    Amongst these are to befound large numbers of young men who in areas such as Suuth             x Gee II. G. (-32) 2,
Wales, the North East Coast and Lanarkshire have  neverhad experience of regular employment.        We Lave in the first place directed our attention to an examination of such provision for theunemployed other than allowances in cash or in kind asis at present made:  and the following is a brief accountof the results of our enquiry,PROVISION L-:A.UB 3Y THE GOVERNMENT.4.      In the case of Juveniles between 14 and 18 ithas for a considerable time teen the policy of theGovernment to provide, through Junior Instruction centres and Glasses administered by the Local Education Authorities,occupation ana instruction of a non-vocational kind.   75%(or in some cases 100lo) of the cost is borne by theExchequer,   On the assumption that such provision willcontinue to te made to the fullest extent practicable wehave not examined more closely the problem of juvenile unemployment.    The details of the present scheme are nowunder review by the National Advisory Council for JuvenileEmployment.,        As regards adults, it has been the policy of theMinistry of Labour until recently to provide vocationaland other training wherever opportunities of re-settlingmen and women in employment have presented themselves.For men this training has been in the main given in theGovernment Training and Transfer Instructional Centresthough in particular instances the Ministry has arranged with outside bodies for training to be undertaken on their behalf.   For women, training, mainly of a domesticcharacter, has been provided on behalf of the Ministry ofLabour by the Central Committee on Women&apos;s Training and
Employment.   The whole  rest of  this training is borne bythe Exchequer,   The  advancing tide of industrial  depressionhas made  it mere ana  more  difficult for  the Ministry  to  con-tinue  cn  any  large  scale their policy of training  owing  to shortage  of vacancies for  the men  on the conclusion of theircourses,  ana  in  the early  part of  this year they were facedwith  the  possibility  of  having to  close  entirely the  Transfer-Instructional Centres.    The Cabinet was informed  of  theposition  regarding  these Centres,  and agreed on 4th May  last(Cabinet  f;c(-^S) , Conclusion 5; ,  as an experiment,  and subjectto review on  re center  1st, 1932,  to the continuance  of  thosewhich  were open  ani the  re-opening of those which  it  had beenfound  necessary  to close owing to  the shrinkage of vacancies.Thenne-forward thane  Centres, renamed Instructional Centres,became primarily occupational and  reconditicning in character.At the same time the  Cabinet decided that a limited experimentshould be made in the  provision  of physical training  for the younger men in selected  areas of heavy unemployment.   Thisscheme is also due for review on December 51st, 1932.        The Ministry  of  Labour schemes,  on their present basis, deal with only  a  small fraction of the adult unemployed.Training  for  employment  can at present be given to seme  4,500men and a similar number of women  during the course of a year,and it is possible that  even these numbers may have to be stillfurther reduced if no  revival of industry occurs in the  nearfuture.   Cn  their present basis the Instructional Centres candeal with about 10,000 men a year  ani the Physical TrainingCentrea with about 4,000.        A fuacther development of Government policy in thedirection of  providing the unemployed with useful  occupationis evidenced  by the recent decision to make a grant to theSociety of Friends in aid  of their allotments Scheme.    It isestimated that the assistance give.p. to the allotments movementTA&apos;ill cover some 100,000  men.                            - 4  - ;

At the present time Lecai Authorities make provision for the unemployed under the following heads:-        (l) The conduct of Junior Instruct.ion Centres            and classes on behalf of the Ministry *f            Labour1;        (8) The provision cf facilities for  cultural            and technical education, either  direct or            by grant, to voluntary agencies.        (3) The provision cf &quot;test&quot; w-^rk and instruction            for&apos;able-bodied persons in receipt cf public            assis assistance .        Prevision by Local Authorities along the  lines   ,suggested in the Minister of health&apos;s Memorandum has hithertbeen no part of the normal activities of Local Authorities.        7/e have already referred to the first t.egypt* -ifactivity.   The third is bound, up with general PublicAssistance practice and principles, which are at presentthe subject of examination by the Kolman Gregory Commissionand we have therefore r,ot felt, ealled upon to make any  o&apos;b-observations on this matter.   As regards the  provision byLocal Authorities cf special Glasses for the unemployed or
                                                           39 facilities for their attendance at  existing Classes the total amount is small,  and has been subject to the general restrictions imposed upon new educational  expenditure. In our view opportunities of cultural  and  technical educa- tion meet at small expense a very real nee a of certain sections of the unemployed.   We accordingly  recommend that the Board of Education,  in co-operation with  the Ministry of Labour,  should do  all in its power  to  encourage Local Education Authorities and voluntary educational bodies in making special provision for the unemployed where there  is evidence of a demand for facilities of this character, and that seme additional money should if necessary be provided for this purpose. PROVISION MALE BY  VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS. 6.      During the  recent years of heavy unemployment spasmodic attempts have been made  by voluntary bodies to provide useful occupation of one  sort  and another  for the adult unemployed in their locality.    This movement  has received considerable impetus  during recent months from the  Prince  of Wales&apos; appeal for personal service and the work of such bodies  as the National Council of  Social Service.    It  is probably safe to  say that in almost every considerable centre of population and in many  small places  something  or  other has been attemptedon  behalf  of  the. unemployed.   While this result is gratifying,it  is  clear  to us that what has been done only deals v/ith asmall  part  of  the problem,  though it forms a useful nucleus onwhich  a  considerable movement could we hope be built up.
     For the most part voluntary effort has taken theform of providing the&quot;unemployed with facilities forreading, recreation and amusement.    In our view this form of provision, though in itself desirable,  is theleast valuable which can be undertaken.   Other formswhich successful voluntary effort has taken may beroughly grouped into the following  categories:-     (l) the provision of allotments and assistance         in cultivating them;     (2) the organisation of sports, games and         physical training;     (3) provision by educational bodies of         special classes for the unemployed, either         cultural or technical, including arrange-         ments for the admission of unemployed         persons to existing classes free or at a         re duce d cha rge;     (4) centres in which simple repairs to boots,         clothing and furniture may be undertaken         by unemployed men or women;     (5) mere ambitious schemes of training or         instruction of a vocational or general         handicraft character&apos;, including centres         in which articles are produced for the         benefit of needy persons;     (6)  occupational schemes  involving outdoor          manual work,  nuch as  have been developed at          Brynmawr.
In our view facilities cf tills kind shvUld be extended tothe utmost extent practicable.   The allotments movement hasmade a premising start.   This, however, makes little appealto the younger men.  Per them we consider that physical training and voluntary works.-c schemes are those &quot;which offer the-most valuable results, and are most capable of wide extension.The success of experiments already made show clearly thatphysical training meats a very real need of the younger menin industrial areas.   This training car: be given verycheaply and extended rapidly5 and we make proposals belowdesigned to achieve this end.     Up to the present very lew voluntary wor*:  schemes havebeen undertaken in  this country, but where a start has beenmade the movement appearn to have met with a ready response from the unemployed and shewn  signs that given  the right  leadeship and appeal it  might well be capable of  considerable  development.   It is significant that the majority of  schemes  ofthis character have been undertaken in  South Waloo, where thefirst experiment was initiated by the Society of  Friendsat Brynmawr.   The;  success of  the German Voluntary labour service movement has encouraged us in  the belief  that  thecorresponding movement in  this country, though  small,  is capable of rapid growth.     The proposals  outlined below  are  an  attempt  to  suggestways in which  the Government  can assist in  achieving  the  end .which we have  advocated.   For&quot;the  sake of  conveniencecur proposals have  been divided into  two  parts5  the  firstdealing with welfare  schemes  in general,  the second  dealingwith the allotments movement.
G5NSPAL ^vZIiFAFJS TORK.7.     It is our considered view  that neither LocalAuthorities nor the Central Government should assumedirect responsibility for welfare work for  the unem-ployed, and that it can more appropriately  and effective-ly be undertaken by private agencies with limitedfinancial assistance in appropriate cases from NationalFunds.   In the popular sine5 the  Local Authorities are closely associated with &quot;test work&quot;, and they are apt to lack the initiative and power of  personal appeal necessaryto make a sue cess of a movement of this character.   Tomake grants to these Authorities  night go a long way towards stultifying the drive for economy in local ex-penditure.   Te think that the National Council of social service, whose policy it is to stimulate and developlocal initiative for welfare wvrk for the unemployedgenerally, should be invited to act as the  main agent ofthe Government in promoting schemes of the  kind coutempla-ted, without, however, excluding  other responsiblenational bodies existing foe the  same purpose in a msrelimited sphere.   There may be exceptional  cases vhnere,after an attempt has been made it is suite  clear that novoluntary organisation will be available.    In such cir-cumstances we would not rule out  the possibility of directgrants to an individual local authority for a particularscheme.0.     As we have already stated, there is  considerablevariety in the schemes which might usefully be developed.They nay be classified broadly as (l) those en whichvolunteers are enployed in the cocas-d/rue-tlon of recreation grounds;, playing fields, n-wimming baths,  etc,, or the
preparation of ground for allotments, (2) occupationalcentres where productive work is undertaken by the un-employed but nit disposed of commercially, (3) clubsand recreation r wras, and (4) physical training classes.9.     We suggest that Exchequer assistance should be concentrated, in the first instance at all events, in themost hardly hit areas, but that, to the extent to whichfunds may allow, it should not te withheld from etherdistricts.   Where schemes of the kind we have in mindare not forthcoming in a district through privateinitiative, or where funds do net admit of their beingassisted from the Exchequer grant, we think it should beopen to the local  authority tJ assist them from rate funds.We do not think any limitation on the classes of unemployed persons invited tn participate in schemes should be imposedbut we are of coin!on that any assistance which it is decided to give should te directed primarily to thosewhich, we understand, cater os rticularly for the youngerelement in the unemployed.10.    Most of the men participating in such schemes wouldin the ordinary way receive the -unemployment benefit ortransitional payments t&apos;) which they may be entitled, pro-vided that they remained available for work, were not undera contract of service and did hot receive remuneration orprofit.   It would probably be possible to arrange thatattendance under the scheme should count as if it wereattendance at the Exchange, for the purpose of proving un-emoloyment.   We must point out, however, in regard particularly to schemes of manual work, that the dividing line between those eligible and those not eligible to receive
benefit or transitional payments under existing legislation^ ^is a fine one, and that no guarantee can bo given thatrestrictions (which could only bo removed by legislation)might not be introduced by decisions of the Umpire inter-preting the law in particular cases.   If it should prove necessary this point might be dealt with in the Unemploy-ment Insurance Bill which the Minister of Labour willhave to pass next Session.     As regards men.receiving transitional payments,which are based on need, a question may arise in some instances as to the value of any meals, etc. received bythe men, but any difficulty arising on this account isnot, thought likely to be serious or widespread.  Shouldevents prove otherwise, it will be necessary to giveserious consideration to the possibility of rectifying theposition by legislation,11.  The following paragraphs outline the  extent ofthe assistance (apart from benefit  and transitional pay-ments) from National Funds which we suggest.   &quot;we have worked on  the gener.l  principle  that  such a ssistanceshould only be given in order to supplement local effort and to the  extent  strictly necessary  for the purpose.The details would  of  coarse have to be settled betweenthe Ministry  of Labour  and the  Treasury..      (a)   For approved  voluntary labour  schemes  a  small grant should be  oa id through  the Central  Organisation, where necessary,  towards,  for example, the  provision of  toolsworking boots  and  other simple  equipment.   It  should  be a condition  for  the  receipt of  the grant  that adequate supervision be provided.   It  is contemplated  that  as a rule the cost  of materials  and other expenses such  as supervision would be  raised  locally.  The  question  of  the  provision of an adequate mid-day meal  is  a difficult one and one  on which we have been unable to  reach a  unanimous conclusion.                           -11-
     Gome of us feel that such provision is essential  if  thework schemes are to be effective,  that  it would prove  tooheavy a burden for local resources,  and that in consequencemeals should be taken into account along with other  expenses in making grants.                                                 -     Others of us doubt whether in all  cases meals will prove necessary, and fear that if the principle of the Governmentproviding them is once admitted,the cost (which might  beas much as  7.10.  a year oer man)  is likely to prove a                                                         -considerable exoense, and one that it will be impossible in future years to get rid of;  and consider, therefore,that at all events at first their provision, where  essential,should be left to local initiative.    These members  thinkthat their prevision by the State would be open to gravepolitical objection and would cut at the root of theprinciple of trying to prevent the man s demoralisation by .: -:   -  &apos;       A :v --...... &apos;&apos; &apos;enlisting his own endeavours.     Schemes should not compete with private enterprise andshould not be such as would be likely to be carried out forwages within a reasonable  period,   Further, no private or commercial interest should be allov/ed to reap financial benefit from the voluntary services of the men concerned.  The lattercondition would exclude work for the improvement of landin private ownership which was not to be transferred to                                                             -public ownership  or dedicated to public  or  charitable  uses.It would be necessary  if a fair trial is to be given to voluntary labour  schemes that these  terms should beavailable for at  least a year, and that  those engaged in organising them should receive some  assurance that  ameasure  of permanence  will be accox^ded by the Governmentshould the movement  prove  successful.
     (b) For occupational centres, comprising workshops in whichsimple articles of furniture or clothing are made or repaired,boots cobbled, etc., a small grant might, if necessary, be made towards the cost of tools-and equipment.                          \     (c) Clubs, Recreation Keens? etc.   We feel that it shouldnot be necessary as a rule for any grunt to be made to social errecreational clubs for the unemployed, and that any expenditure incurred under this heading ought to be met entirely from localfunds.  There may, however, be a few exceptional cases where asmall initial grant might be justified.     (d) Physical Trsining Olasses.   We recommend that theexisting experimental Ministry of Labour centres, which are due for review in December next, should continue for the present asDemonstration Centres.  They need not necessarily continue inthe places where they are now established.  In addition agrant for classes of this kind organised by voluntary - effortmight be made on the basis of providing the necessary kit forthe men or take the form cf a fixed sum per class sf a certainsize, according to circumstances and as experience suggests.     (e) For expenses of National Organisation in stimulatingschemes.    If the national Council of Social Service are to stimulate the voluntary efforts of local affiliated bodies in organising suitable welfare schemes on the large scalenecessary&apos;to produce any important development, it will benecessary that their headquarters and local staff shouldbe strengthened.   In particular, a few paid local organiserswould be required.    The Council would require some financial assistance for this purpose.  Whether it isnecessary at this stage to plan an organisation covering the whole country, as they have suggested to us, or whetherit will suffice for the time being to concentrate efforts
in the more hardly hit areas is a point  for consideration, as is also the method of co-operation of the Council&apos;sofficers with the local representatives  of the Ministryof Labour.   A grant in the neighbourhood of  10,000would be required in the first year if the whole  country were to be covered forthwith even on an  exiguous  scale;and concentration oh selected areas &quot;would not cost much less.   It will prebanly be desirable to  recognise a specialorganisation for Scotland, and to ear-mark a part of  theadministration grant for this purpose.   There are cases    inalso/which similar assistance on a smaller scale  toother organisations would be justified.    For examole. TheNational Playing Fields Association have a certain amountof cash in hand some of which we understand they  might beorepared to soend in acquiring sites in distressed areas forplaying fields.   They also think they could obtain acertain amount of land by gifts from private individuals and colliery Companies etc., while if the scheme  underdiscussion proved a substantial success, they anticipate that an appeal to the public for funds to accelerate thepurchase of land elsewhere would meet with a considerableresponse.12.     These proposals are necessarily tentative in character and v/ould need modification in the light of experience.   In view of this wre find it impossible toestimate with any exactitude what would be the cost ofthese proposals.   Apart from clubs and recreation rooms thegrant per head exclusive of administration expenses might reasonably be expected to be not more than  2 per annum.Clubs and recreation rooms would however, be a large proportionof the  total effort and therefore the grant per  (say) 10,000 men might not exceed  10,000 to  15,000.   To this is to be added the initial grant of about  10,000 for administrationexpenses which would be spread  over ail forms of activity.                         -14-
13.  Vo ou^nt p^j.-2*apw  to  add a warning against exaggeratedexpectations with regard  to  the number cf men for whom&quot;owonpjit.i.on&quot; would he  provided under these proposals in thenear future.   So far  as  regards Government action, the schemeis a new departure in  the  treatment of the unemployment problem, and, while -we believe that cur proposals are sound, it remains to be seen whether or how quickly they will prove a success,   It may be that, particularly in the hardly-hit areas,voluntary effort will  not  respond to the stimulus which it isintended to apply or will  respond on a limited scale only and,if this is so, the number  of men who will benefit there bythese proposals will be a  few thousand only.   On the other handrecent experience with a similar scheme in Germany has beenencouraging.    In any cvent, it is probable that voluntaryeffort will take time  to  gather momentum and will 2101 produce any substantial results this winter,14.   It should be noted that there is nc legislation authorising the Ministry of Labour to  expend money on such a scheme as theforegsing, nor is it within  the ambit of their vote.    As regards legislation,  the Public Accounts Committeehave recently emphasised   -    &quot;that, where it is desired that continuing functions should     be exercised by a Government Department- particularly     where such functions  may involve financial liabilities     extending &quot;beyond  a given financial year, it is proper,     subject t&amp; certain recognised exceptions, that the j owe rs     and duties to be  exercised should be defined by specific     statute&quot;c /  Q?x the other hand, a report  (Appendix I) by one of the    Ministry of Health&apos;s General Inspectors shows what can be    done in a particularly hardly hit area.s   The German Voluntary Labour Service Movement first    received official  recognition in July, 1931.,   On    September 1st, 193 0, it provided occupation for 144,900    young men.  By October 1st, 1930, this number had    risen to nearly 000,S(i)0.
 As  the  present  scheme,  if  approved, will he  of an experimental and emergency  character, it may not he necessary to obtain legislation  covering  it, at any rate for the  present.  If however,  the scheme is  put on  a permanent basis legislation should  be obtained at an early stage.     As regards the Vote,  it will presumably  be necessary to  introduce a  supplementary estimate providing m^ney for this scheme  and enlarging  the ambit of the Ministry of Labour Vote.A large supplementary estimate will be necessary forUnemployment Insurance  and Transitional Payments &quot;before the end of  the year, and  the necessary provision  in regard to the^present scheme -could  be made in that.  As it  is a new service, it  will not be  possible to spend money on it  from the supplementary estimate until that estimate is passed, but this difficulty could be overcome if the Treasury  are aisle to advance the necessary money.15.  Allotments fgr the Unemployed.   The Society of Friends are about to make a public  appeal  for funds to provide seeds, tnols, .fertilisers, etc. at  reduced rates for 106,00$ unemployed and partially employed persons cultivating allotments.  The Society of  Friends hega?i this work four years ago. in South Wales, axd in1929/30 received assistance from the L^rd Mayor&apos;s Fund.  During19 3G/31 the  Government, recognising the value of the work, aade a grant in anticipation ^-f the passing into law of the Agricul- tural Land (Utilisation) Bill  and for that season adopted an&amp; administered,  through the  Central Allotments  Committee set up by the Ministry of Agriculture, a s^hame which  was on almost- axactLy--- the same  lines  as  that  originally  instituted in South Wales  and continued under the Lord Mayor&apos;s Committee.   The net  cost of the scheme  falling  on  public funds was  26,BOO,  assistance being given to  64,00n allotment holders.   Last year, as  a measure of  national economy,  the Government withdrew financial  support,  the
Central Allotments Committee ceased to function and theFriends&apos; Allotments Committee (which had been brought  into existence when the lord Mayor&apos;a Fund came to an end),  raisedapproximately  1B,CCC by subscription, and the allotment holders themselves provided, by small weekly contributions,another  16,COO.   Assistance was given at a total cost  ofapproximately  30,000 to 62,000 allotment holders, the valueof the cr ps produced being estimated by the.Society at 400,000.   This year the Society have applied to theDevelopment Commission for a grant tcarry on and extend their work, so as to enable 100,000 allotments to be worked.It has been decided, in respect of assistance to unemployedor ;partially employed persons to make a grant from public funds on a  1 for  1 basis up to  10,000 and on a  1 for   2basis to the extent of a further  2,500, making in all amaximum contribution from public funds of  12,500, conditional upon the Society raising  15,000 and spending during the  comingseason the  27,500 which would thus be at their disposal.Details of the scheme are still being worked out.   In Englandand wales  the administration of the grant is at present  beingsupervised by the Ministry  of Labour, and in Scotland by  theScottish Department of Agriculture.16.    It is hoped that the arrangements contemplated forthe 1933 cropping season will result in an additional 38,000men being assisted, as compared with the cropping season  of      i1032, making a total of 100,000 men.   This is, of course,conditional on the Society  of Friends bei^g able to raise,  asa result of their appeal, the  15,000 required to earn the  maximum of grant from the Development Commissi.jn of  12,500.       It is clear to us that little extension of this programme is possible during the coming season, even if more generousfinancial assistance v/ere provided.   We have however                          -17-
considered, the possibility of extending the scheme forthe cropping season of 1934 and for this  purpose  wehave mad-a the following assumptions:-       (1)  that the necessary money will  be available           either from the Exchequer or private sources,           the necessary cc roller y to which would seem           to be a clear indication of  continuity of           policy on the part of the Government in           regard to the question.   This is regarded           as a matter of  the greatest possible impor-           tance in connection with any scheme for           substantial extent ion.           (in this connection it  should  be remembered  that.           the Society of  Friends  have been informed  by           the Treasury that  the grant is an emergency  &apos;           grant for one year and that  the  Treasury are           unable to contemplate further  grants in           succeeding years).       (2)  That  local  authorities  will be  encouraged              acquire  lane for  the  purpose,  provided           r.c  annual  less would  be  incurred  on such           prevision;           (The  propriety of  taking such  action while           economy  in  local expenditure in  all other           directions  is being  advocated  is  a matter           for consideration  although we have been           informed by  the Ministry of Health that  the           Economy Circular issued  to local Authorities           e&quot;ated  the 11th Septembers 19*1, was intended           tt  make  an  exemption  in  favour of expenditure           of  this type,   It should, however, be borne           in  mind  that  an inquiry  into local e conomy
    is r.C7/ in progress.    Any misunderstanding  on    the pant of local authorities  in  regard to    this could rest be removed by  Question and    Answer in the House of Commons).(?)  That the men will be forthcoming  to  cultivate    allotments, if they could be provided;    (The fear that public Assistance  Committees    may take into acccunt the prevision  of    an allotment in connect ion with payment of    transitional benefit or  outdoor  relief,  or    even, alternatively, that a man&apos;s uneir.pl oy-    ment benefit may be affected,  may act as  a    deterrent,    The Committee- is  informed that    until, the fear is removed it will operate    generally in the direction of  deterring a    considerable number of men from taking    advantage of this Scheme).(4)  That it is desirable that the  existing    voluntary organisation of the  Society of    Friends should continue to perform  the    work of propaganda and local organisation.    (Apart from the desirability of utilising    voluntary agencies and private financial    support for the allotments scheme,  in    common with other schemes for  the ameliorative-    tion of the condition of unemployed persons;    there v;ould net seem to be any material
               advantage in faking the work out of the               hands cf the Society of Friends Allotments               Committee and entrusting it tc some other               body, unless such body had command of               greater financial resources or were given               more drastic powers as regards cheaper               acquisition of land than the local author!               tics at present possess.)IS.   The Society of Friends are faced with a con-siderable task in increasing by -58,000 the number ofmen assisted for the cropping season of 1933, anincrease of 6Q%, as compared with the cropping seasonof 1932, and it would not be safe to assume that so large a further percentage increase would be obtainableIn 1954, even if local authorities were encouraged toprovide additional land.   The requirement that suchacquisition should be on a self-supporting basis is bound to restrict the provision of additional land in or near many of the large cities and towns although anumber of boroughs and urban districts  including Bath,Bristol, Reading and Southampton, found it. possibleto purchase land for allotments in 1930 (the last 3-earfor v/hich figures are available) at less than  .120 anacre, at which it, should he possible to fram^ self-supporting schemes.   The average for the whole countryfor the four years to 1930 was approximately  137per acre.19.   Any estimates as to the possibility of theextension of the scheme for the cropping season of 1934must of necessity be conjectural, but provided thepolicy were settled now and the necessary steps were taken to improve and develop the present organisation,                         -43 CT.
 it might he possible  to provide assistance in 1934 for a further 20,000 to 30,000 persons making 120,000 to 130,000  in all, hut the total likely to be assisted in 1934 will obviously depend on the extension which actually takes place  in regard to the cropping season of 1933. 20.    It would only  be practicable for these figures to be  increased if the Government were prepared to in- struct the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to exert ccntinual  pressure on local authorities to acquire additional land.       As  regards those areas where it was found impossible to acquire land on a  self-supporting basis, powers exist under the Agricultural Land (Utilisation)  Act,  1931,  to enable local authorities to acquire land for allotments with financial assistance from the Exchequer. 21.    AS a matter or urgency we wish to draw attention to the possibility of establishing in Northumberland a  residential Centre  to which unemployed men from theNorth East Coast could be sent to undertake useful work.At Kielder, between the North Tyne and the ScottishBorder,  the Forestry Commission have recently acquired an estate of 45,000 acres-    In the normal v/ay  the estatewould be developed over a period of twenty years, but - if unemployed workers were utilized in the same way
as on other1 estates of the Commission where theMinistry of Labour have Centres, the work couldbe nnich accelerated.  Appendix II gives an outline of - the arrangements proposed and provisional estimates of costs.   The schemeseems to us to be one that ought to be adoptedparticularly in view of the serious position on the North East Coast, and the fact that theMinistry of Labour may find it necessary to close the Wallsend Training Centre and therebydiminish the already meagre provision madefor the unemployed of the area.   The needfor a decision on this proposal is urgentas the Forestry Commission must know quicklywhether they are to revise their plans forthe development of  the estate.22.     The Financial Secretary to the Treasury hasup to the oresent been unable  to attend the meetingsof the Committee.   It will be understood that he isnot committed to these recommendations.
SUMMARY CF RLGOk; CLID^.TIONS AND CONCLUSIONS.2 5.   Recommendatiqns.     The Committee submit to the Cabinet  the  followinginterim recommendations ani conclusions :-     (a1  That assistance be given by Government          Grant to the movement, for providing  the          unemployed with opportunities of useful          occupation and recreation.   In  particular,          we make proposals relating to the construction          of recreation grounds, playing  fields, etc.          and the formation of physical training classes.          Voluntary organisations are alreaiy at work          an these lines, and the grants  which  we          sugg^eso are  intended to assist  them in          extending their activities.   We contemplate          grants only  in respect of expenses  of organisation,          cost of tools and equipment,  etc. and we          recommend that these should so  far  as possible          reach the organisations concerned through          the National Council of Social  Service,          or other--suitable bodies.    &apos;*e  suggest also,          a  grant to meet the  expenses incurred by          the Council  itself in  stimulating local          effort.          Men and women participating in  assisted schemes          would receive no cash  payments  in addition          to the Unemployment  Insurance benefits etc. to          which they are at present entitled.     (b)   That the experimental  physical  training          centres of the Ministry of Labour (the          authority for which  expires in  December          1932)  should continue  for the present as          demonstration centres.     (c)   That the Ministry of Labour and the Board of          Education should encourage the  provision of          special classes for  the unemployed, and          facilities for their attendance  at existing          classes.     (d)   That it is desirable to develop and extend          to the utmost the Allotments Scheme,  and          that to this end the Society of Friends be  -          informed of  the amount of grant in  respect of ;          their  Allotments Scheme which will  be forthcoming          in future  years;   and  that,  in  order  to make the          scheme effective.  Local Authorities be encouraged          to acquire land for  use as  allotments, where          it appears that no less will be involved.          If in certain large  industrial  areas  where          allotments are most  needed,  land cannot be so          acquired,  the Government  should consider the          grant  of financial assistance to the  Local          Authority.     (e)   That immediate consideration be given to          the establishment  of a Ministry of  Labour Centre          on the Forestry Commission&apos;s Lstate at          Kielder in Northumberland.ft tz
2 4,.   Conclusions.        There are at present approximately 2,358,000persons registered as unemployed.  Of these 2,503,000are men over 18 years of age and of these it is known that at least 711,000 have been continuously umemployed for six months or more, and 403,000 for more than a year;these two latter figures indicate the size of the realcore of stubborn and continued unemployment.  Amongst the mare to be found large numbers of young men, especiallyin areas such as South Wales, the North East Coast andLanarkshire who have never had experience of regular employment.  Whether viewed from the standpoint of thefuture of the nation or of the interests of the young menthemselves, this last part of the problem seems to us tobe of special gravity and specially needing some remedy or at least some measure of palliation.   We have, therefore,thought it right first of all to consider what can be donein regard to it find the proposals made by us for develop-ment of occupation, physical training and education aredevised primarily with reference to it.   They will also,of course, be applicable to other classes of the unemployed,and this applies in a greater degree to our proposals asregards allotments.        Although at first sight our proposals may seem tocover only a small number, they do, at any rate, make a beginning, and we should hope that by the end of the first12 months they will have acquired substantial momentum.  Itis clear, however, that they are limited in scope and wetherefore propose, within our Terms of Reference, to examineproposals of somewhat wider scope, including the possibilities-ities presented by Small Holdings and Land Settlement.                        -24-

                         APPENDIX I.                         SOUTH SHIELDS.             Unemployed Men&apos;s Recreational Centres.           Report by the Assistant General Inspector.          I visited the three Recreational Centres atSouth Shields yesterday.   The scheme providing for thessCentres was initiated by Colonel Chapman, M. P., the Mayor, inthe Spring of this year, when he called a meeting of theClergy of all denominations and leading Employers in the Townto discuss the matter.   As a result, the first Centre was opened on the 25th April last, at Zion Hall,  a disused Chapelbelonging to Colonel Chapman, who is making no charge for its use.          The Centres are under the management of a Committeeof fifteen, consisting of Employers, Clergy and a representativeof the men, under the chairmanship of Councillor Bell, who ischairman of the local Rotarians,   This Committee concernsitself almost entirely with questions of finance and offers ofassistance in kind, and leaves the detailed management of the centres, very successfully, to an Executive Committee of seven,composed of unemployed men whose names were suggested by employers as being experienced in the management of men.   Thesemen, who receive no payment, made themselves responsible for preparing the Hall for use, and found no difficulty inobtaining volunteers to clean the building and to distemperand paint parts of it, the materials being given by sympathisers.          Two days after the Centre had been opened it wasvisited by the Prince of Wales, which, undoubtedly,  had theeffect of making it well-known,, for the attendance from the outset has been in the neighbourhood of from 1,200 to 1,500men a day.   There is no entrance fee, the only qualificationbeing the production of the Unemployment Insurance Card by menover 18 years of age.   There are two large Halls, formerlythe Chapel and the Sunday School, and a smaller room,  which contains three carpenter&apos;s benches,  a supply of tools, andlasts for the use of men dosirous of repairing their shoes.The forms and tables were made voluntarily by the men, the materials being given by various employers.   A stage forconcerts has also been made by the men.          The Centre is open from 9.30 a.m. to 18 noon, andfrom 1.30 to 5 p.m. from Monday to Friday.   Saturday isoccupied in cleaning up the Hall, for which the Men&apos;s Committeefind no difficulty in obtaining volunteers.   The recreationsinclude cards, chess, draughts, dominoes and quoits, whilstthere is also a good supply of papers and magazines, togetherwith a lending library, which at present contains 250 volumes,which have been given.   Two pianos, a harmonium, and instrumentsfor an orchestra of nine, have been presonted to the Centre, anda male voice choir has also been sot up.   Concerts  are giveneach Wednesday evening to which the men and their wives areinvited.   Admission is free by ticket issued only to regularusers of the Centre.   I understand that the concerts are verypopular and that the usual attendance is about 1,000.    Acollection is taken in aid of the funds at each concert, but. Iwas told that it rarely exceeds  1..    The men have,  however,managed out of the proceeds to purchase a good wireless forwhich they paid  18.   Lectures arranged by the Men&apos;s Committeeare also given each week.   No difficulty has been experienced in/
in obtaining lecturers, and amongst the subjects already dealtwith I found &quot;Wireless&quot; by the Newcastle B. B.C.  Director,&quot;Newspapers&quot; by the Editor of the local newspaper,  &quot;Books&quot; bythe Borough Librarian, &quot;The Unemployment Insurance  Act&quot; by theEmployment Exchange Manager, and &quot;Law and Punishment&quot; by the deputy Town Clerk.          Some time ago, at the request of the men  attending theCentre, the Executive Committee approached the Clergy and ministers of the Town with a view to services being held on sunday evenings.   As a result, two services attended by the male voice choir and orchestra are held each Sunday evening at.15 and 8, at which a short undenominational address is givenby one of the Clergy or Ministers, who have formed  a rota forthis purpose.   I understand that these services are wellattended by the men, their wives and children.   Whist Drivesare held each Thursday and Friday afternoons in one of the Halls,at which the attendance is usually about 150.   A charge of 2d.  ismade for the scoring card, and four prizes of packets of groceriesare given0          Boxing has been found to be a very popular recreationand it was soon necessary to obtain other accommodation for this.The use of a disused Tram Shed belonging to the Corporation hasbeen obtained, and boxing takes place here each afternoon.   Thereis an excellent ring, which has been lent, together with aplentiful supply of boxing gloves, shorts, singlets5 shoes, etc.,all of which have been given.   During the morning  any mandesirous of training can attend, but no boxing is allowed, thetime being occupied with skipping, the punching ball and thevaulting horse.   There are many old boxers amongst the unemployedof this Town, and the Executive Committee of men have found nodifficulty-in obtaining suitable persons to manage  this side oftheir activities.   Boxing exhibitions are held twice a week andare very well attended.   When I visited this Centre some hundreds of men were watching a boxing bout, and I understand that thisis no unusual attendance.          In the Tramway grounds the men have made  a quoits pitoh,and this is so well patronised that another is under construction.During the past summer the men have played local teams and Iunderstand won a ^knock-out&quot; championship.          A good deal of cricket has been played during the summer.   Pitches have been lent for use during the week by theSouth Shields Cricket Club and Y.M.C.A. , whilst the men have been allowed to use the Corporation Bowling Greens free  of charge.          Owing to the overcrowding of the Zion Hall, a furthercentre has recently been opened at the Cadet Hall in Warne Street,which has been lent for the purpose for three days  a week.   Here,besides literature, cards, draughts, dominoes, jig-saw puzzles,etc. there are parallel bars, a ping-Hong table and bagatelle board.The attendance at present at this Centre, which consists of one large room, is from 50 to 100 a day, and seems to attract the younger members of the unemployed, although it has  not been set upspecially for this purpose,-          It is interesting to note that most of the equipment ofthis Centre was obtained from a Centre which was set up by certainladies of the Town for the use of unemployed women  and girls, butit/
it seems to have died from lack of support by the latter.The Committee have obtained the free offer of the disusedstables of the Bolingbroke Street Drill Hall, and it isproposed shortly to open these as workshops where men canoccupy their time in manual pursuits.          During my visit to the Centres I was much impressed by the good order displayed by the men, and I was told thaton only one occasion has it been necessary to ask a man  toleave the premises on account of misconduct.    The disciplinaryarrangements have, wisely, been left to the men themselves with very successful results.   The Men&apos;s Executive Committeehave set up a rota of stewards to assist them in this respect.The position of steward seems to be prized and has attracteda very good type of man.6/10/32.
                    APPENDIX  II.                                 56           KIOLDER. ESTATE. FORESTRY  CO^TOOjow.    Estimate of  cost of  providlng.instruct!onal  centres  f or                    uiiemplcyod irfen -                &quot; (1) To provide  a hutted centre with  accommodation  for 200 men.     H.M. Office of &quot;Vorks estimate that  the cost of the hutments, if  done Try contract- would he about  10,000-  A suitable site has hee?&apos;d selected but it has not yet been surveyed..  The above figure may be token as an outside figure.   If the huts were made and erected by trainee labour from existing  centres the cost would be ab-;ut  6,000.     In addition, there would be the cost of equipment -which wouldbe about  2,00f)- 2,500.  This includes such motor  transport as wouldbe needed for the running of the centre, but it does not include provision for transport of men or materials for.purposes of road-making or similar work, which it is assumed that the forestry commission would provide.     The centre would accommodate 200 men at a  time and would dealwith 800-900 individuals in the course of a year-  The running cost for a year would he about  6,500 to  7..000 including travelling expenses and in addition to unemployment benefit or transitionalpayment, which it is assumed the men would be receivings     The work on which  the men would he  engaged would he the laying out and preparation cf  the estate for afforestation, including land clearance, road-making,  quarrying, drainage, fencing, etc.. (2) Tented Camps-  It would be possible  during  the summer months to attach to the hutted centre tented camps in units  of say 200 men at a time.  The cost of hiring so;ne and purchasing ether tentage and equipment for 200 men,  including its transport, and of  providing a water supply Wild be about  1,500. This  does not include any provision for the transport of the men-     The running costs  would be about the same  as  for the hutted centre, ice, a  camp for 200 men attached to the hutment centre would cost about  2,700 for the five summer months, and would deal with about 400  individuals.
