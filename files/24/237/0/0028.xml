KTE8 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY18 Q0VESBTMT3fr.secret ..P.27(55) .COPY NO.40CABINET.The International Convention on the hours         of work in Coal Mines.Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade     I must ask, as a matter of some urgency, for a decision onthe line the Secretary for Mines is to take at a meeting calledby the International Labour Office to take place on February 20thto discuss the position of this Convention *   .  My colleagues will recollect that in February, 1952, the thenSecretary for Minee was authorised to announce the Government1spolicy in regard to this Convention in the following terms:-        &quot;His Majesty&apos;a Government is favourably disposed towards   the Convention.   The detailed application of some of its   provisions to the coal mines of this country presents certain.                               I   problems which are under consideration.   As soon as these   points have been disposed of, the Government Will &quot;be. prepar*e.d   to ratify the Convention, provided that the six other   countries will do so at the same time&quot;.     During the passage of tile Goal Mines Bill last June -that^an^wer was quoted and the policy reaffirmed.     The Convention, which was adopted by the General Oonferon.ce^^of the International Labour Organisation in June, 1931, fixes a daily limit of 7l hours  &apos;bank  to bank&apos;, and also provides that under the British method of calculation (from the time the lastman of a shift goes down to the time the first man comes up) theperiod shall be 7  hours.   Ratification would mean, therefore, inthis country a reduction of    of an hour a day.   The history ofthe Convention and&apos;the attitude towards it of the mine ownersa-
and of the miners was explained at some length in CP. 131 (32),dated 28th January, 1932.     The principle of international regulation of hours of workin coal mines was commended by members of all parties(including Mr. Baldwin and Sir Herbert Samuel) during thediscussions on the Coal Mines Bill, 1931.   The presentConvention, however, has been vigorously opposed by the ownersin view of the depressed state of the coal mining industry.   Onthe other hand, the men have pressed that we should bring theConvention into force.   Ify colleagues will probably remember that lir. Shinwell, Secretary for toines in the Labour Government,pressed for the Convention very strongly and he was ready to waive the settling of various technical difficulties, which are mentioned below, in order to achieve his end.     Yttien I obtained the authority of my colleagues for theannouncement which Mr. Foot made last February, it did not seem likely that either of the two conditions mentioned would besatisfied; in particular it seemed most unlikely that agreement on the part of the other six European countries concerned tothe principle of simultaneous ratification would be secured inthe near future.   The International Labour Office, however,has now secured from all these countries statements that theyare ready to proceed to simultaneous ratification, and has accordingly invited all the Governments concerned to attend an informal meeting at Geneva on February 20th &quot;to examine thesituation in the light of recent developments&quot;.   It was clearlynecessary for us to accept this invitation and we have already done so, but I must ask for a decision as to the  line our representatives are to take.     At the present moment, for the first time for several years,there is peace in the coal industry,  and at present there is nolikelihood of serious wage trouble arising after the expiration,
in July next, of the existing guarantees.    But I  must warn mycolleagues that there is a grave danger of serious trouble  ifthe Convention becomes operative - some time in 1935.    It  isclearly impossible for the present wage rates to be maintainedif hours are to be reduced, unless the coal trade  shows a more marked improvement than can yet be foreseen, and I have already received a deputation from the Mining Association, which madestrong representations to me against any Convention affectingminers&apos;  hours and against this Convention in particular.    Amongthe additional grounds of their objection was the  fact thatthe wage rates of British miners are high as compared  with  those on the Continent and therefore a reduction in hours throws  aproportionately greater financial burden on British owners  thanon Continental owners;  they also assert that Continentalinterpretation of the Convention will not be so strict as ours.     I therefore recommend to my colleagues that our representatives should be instructed to press the  needfultechnical objections at the meeting this month.     The Appendix to this memorandum sets out the  more important of these objections and the line which the Secretary for Minessuggests should be taken on each.   I feel that he should take as strong a line as he can on these objections.     It is possible, however, that we may find ourselves in theposition of having secured the support of the other sixgovernments concerned to all our proposed amendments to theConvention,   The International Labour Office feels that itsreputation rests upon the ratification of this Convention andwill leave no stone unturned to secure it.   If, therefore, ourdelaying tactics fail, we should be left in the position of having to fulfil our pledges and ratify.   I myself do not regard this as very probable, though it is certainly possible.There is, it is true, one other possible loophole, viz:- if it
transpires thai; the other- *ix  jourrtrios are bluffing and thatthey will not, in fact, proceed to ratification.   I do not feelthat I can say with any certainty what are the chances of this,though the change of attitude of some of them, within the last six months, may he thought too complete to he genuine.     I must warn my colleagues that if we adopt these- delayingtactics - a policy to which I see no alternative - the Governmentwill he the subject of considerable public criticism in Europegenerally from the International Miners&apos; Federation and in thiscountry from the Miners1 Federation, though private conversations with the leaders of the latter make one suspect that they would much prefer to maintain the present peace in the industry than to be involved in widespread -wages-troubles as a result of the ratification of the Convention.                                            nr. R.ard of Trade, 10th February, 1933.  *
1 Q/113S                    APPENDIX.      International Conventj on on the Hours      _of Work in Coal Mines._Objections by the Mining Association in regard to   the practical appJication in Great Britain          of certain of its provisions._         Objections.vention Article 6.Is Article prohibits  Sunday work,h certain exceptions.)iThe first shift of the week  wouldunable to start before  midnight onday, with the result  that all theifta through the week  would be put-k, and the early finish on,urday prevented.  Shifts finishing in the earlyvb of Sunday morning would alsoillegal.The prohibition (by this Article)the employment at all on Sundaystoys under 18 is undesirable fromsafety point of view, as its the employment of adults on (e.g, haulage) to which theynot accustomed.Remarks.(a) This is a real difficulty, and attention was called to it (and topoint (b)) in a note prepared bythe Mines Department In the spring of 1931, when the drsft Articleprepared by the I.L.O. was published.   The considered policy ofthe British Government, however,was to avoid as far SB possible any amendments to the I.L.O. draft,unless there was general agreement.These points were not, therefore,pressed at the Conference in Jtoa1931.     I think, that we must uphold^this objection, and insist uponrevision of the Article to meet thespecial requirements of Great-Britain.(b) There is some substance inthe safety point - but thedifficulties are not insurmountable,I do not think that we can press this objection.There is a third point arising on this Article, but it has not been raised officially by the Mining Association.   At certain mines inScotland (but nowhere else) the practice exists of actual coal-turningon Sundays.   This would be prevented by the Convention, and there wouldbe some outcry locally*   But the practice is an undesirable one, andthere is certainly no valid objection to its being stopped.ention Article 7.s Article provides fornations to be made by publicority for shortening working&apos;a for workers in unhealthy places. this is unnecessary.     These regulations are to bemade for &quot;particularly unhealthy&quot;places, and each Government is leftto judge for itself.     I do not think that we canuphold this objection.
avention Article 8.his Article provides  (a) for up half an hour extra time foratinuous shift workers, and for overtime to he  paid for is extra period.)) This half hour is not sufficient enable the workers concerned toange over at the working place.I It is quite illogical to requireIrtime rates of payment for it.mention  Article, 9.The  60 hours  a  year  &quot;commercial&quot;rtime provision may  he  used iner countries  by way  of  a  regularition to the  length  of  the  working, and the provision  for payment of extra may be got over  byjusting&quot; the  daily wage.(a) This is an objection of substance.  The number of meninvolved is small - probably not more than 5,000 - but theyare key men and their continuousattendance in the pit isessential to its safety.Attention was drawn to the pointby the Mines Department in 1931,but the general policy of theGovernment applied here as inthe case of Article 6 (above).   I think that we must upholdthis objection, and call for amendment..(b) There is something in this,but I do not regard it as of sufficient importance to treatit as a major objection-     This is true, but inlegislating in this country (onratification) we can take powerto allow the same thing here,provided that the mine owners can make the necessary agreement withmen regarding the extra time andextra payment.     There is substance in thi6objection, but I do not think thatwe can press it too far.
