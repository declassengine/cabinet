MAIfUFACTURE OF ARMAMENTS - PRINCIPLE OF LICENCES.       Report of  the Interdepartmental  Committee.1.     The Interdepartmental Disarmament Committee has recently had under consideration a Geneva Memorandum issued by the Sub-committee before on the Manufacture of Arms (see Appendix).  This  Sub-Committee was appointed by the Committee for&quot;the Regulation ofthe Trade in and Private and State Manufacture of Arms and implements of War, for the purpose of studyinp: Licensing Systems.2.     The idea of national licensing on R standardised modelfirst appeared in tha Arms Traffic Convention of 19^-5.   Thisconvention has remained unratified owing to the objections  of thenon-producing States.  The idea cf the 1929 draft Convention forthe regulation cf manufacture of arms was to give equal publicity to all war material manufactured and thereby to satisfy the demand of the non-producing states.  A system of national licensing isalso to be found in the latter draft convention.   The object of licensing in both cases was to obtain some control, by  theoperation of public opinion, of the manufacture and export  of armsand so to deal with the alleged &quot;grave objections&quot; referred toin Article 8 of the Covenant.3.     A Questionnaire has recently boon drawn up by the Sub-Committee referred to in paragraph 1 which it is intended should form the basis of the Committee&apos;s future procedure; thisquestionnaire ie apparently intended to glean information as toany systems of licences for the manufacture of armaments at presentin force in the countries represented at the Disarmament Conference                               -1-
Ultimatelys it is believed;; it is the intention of this Committeeto recommend whether any system of licensing, if such should beconsidered necessary, should be on an international or a national basis.  There arc no other practical alternatives.4.   This Committee is due to reassemble in a short time, andit is necessary for the representative of the United kingdom delegation to know, what attitude he is to adopt: and it was forthis purpose that we met to consider the  implications raised bythis question.5o   After considerable discussion we were unable to reach agreement as to whether a comprehensive system of licensing was desirable for the control of the manufacture of arms *  Furthermore,as there was no concrete proposal for a licensing system beforeus, it was not possible for the Committee to consider the implications, financial? legislative, etc., which its adoption inthis country might involve.     It was suggested that any system would be expensive to setup, since there is a large number of firms in this countryengaged in making armaments and their component parts.  Also itwould be embarrassing to the executive-  The arbitrary powers that would inevitably be invested in the executive are likely tocreate great opposition in Parliament from the manufaciraringinterests concerned.6.   From the point of view of this country, we are satisfiedthat so far as traffic in arms is concerned all the controlnecessary Is already exercised through the Exports ProhibitionOrder-in-Counoil.70   We understand that there is strong support at Geneva forthe idea of imposing some form of international licensing systemwhereby the manufacture of armaments may be controlled.  We were
agreed that any system of international licensing ought to heopposed, and indeed the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government inthat connection has already &quot;been indicated in Parliament.&quot;The question therefore arises whether it would he advisable fromthe military point of view for us to advocate a form of stan-dardised national licensing.  There are obvious dangers in thiscourse as we might find a standardised form of national licensingvery harassing to our private manufacturers on whom we largely depend for the supply of our war material nor does it seem that such a system of licensing, without agreement as to theprinciples upon which manufacture would be allowed or prohibited,would do more than create difficult problems for the governmentsconcerned; e.g. would they refuse manufacture ofarmaments for China or Japan or both?   What view  would france or the U.S.A. take; would it be the same as ours?  The only alternative is to oppose all forms of standardised licensing forthe regulation   of trade in, and manufacture of arms and toleave things as they are at present with export licence only.There may be political reasons, which lie naturally outside ourcompetence, why an attitude of complete opposition to anystandardised licensing system may be considered inadvisable.We feel it would be unfair to our delegate that he shouldhave to attend the meetings of the Committee having no definite instructions at all, and we hesitate without consultation with higher authority to assume responsibility for instructing ourdelegate to oppose all forms of licensing seeing that thegeneral feeling at Geneva appears to contemplate that some kindof licensing will be essential.8.   The Admiralty also feel that to advocate a form ofstandardised national licensing without definition of the objectfor which it is proposed is an illogical and dangerous procedure and one which would not satisfy the aspirations of thosedelegates at Geneva who are in favour of international licensing.         x By Lord Kailsham                      Hansard, House of Lords, Sth December, 1932.                              -3-
They consider, therefore, that our representative should concentrate on obtaining seme definition, and specificationof the conditions under which it is proposed that manufacture and traffic in arms will he prohibited under tho Convention.When this has been obtained it will he appropriate to define the machinery by which it should be carried outs and theAdmiralty feel confident that for this country theappropriate machinery will he by the existing system of export licences,9,   The Admiralty alrjc feel that if a system ofstandardised national licensing for the regulation of tradein and manufacture of arms is opposed, by our representativeshe would be far from presenting merely a blank negative ifhe was to point out that we already have a complete systemof licensing embodied in the Washington and London LavalTreaties Acts, and. that a similar system would undoubtedly be appropriate for ensuring the compliance with anylimitations or prohibitions of war material which may beagreed to by the General Convention,,  They, therefore, feelthat elucidation of the purposes for which the proposedstandardised national licensing system is required,supplemented by emphasis  on the Washington and london naval Treaties Acts as a model for implementing theConvention, would be a perfectly satisfactory attitude forour rcpre sentative to adopt *10C   We therefore ask for definite instructions an to what course our representative on the Sub-Committee should pursue,Ye would add that should it be decided to support astandardised system of national licensing it will be
necessary for us to consider carefully, having regard tointerests of national security and economy., what system of licensing wo could he prepared to advocate and adopt, it being understood that we could not accept any form  ofiinternational licensinga                    Signed c2i behalf of the Sub-Committee                             Co HOWARD SMITH                                 Chairmana2, Whitehall Gardens, S. ..&apos;.1!.

Study of licensing systems,               Note by the Chairman.     The Chairman has the honour to submit to the members of theSub-Committee  the list of questions emerging from the initialexamination of the various licensing systems described by themembers of the Sub-Committee.   This provisional list of questionsright be utilised both for the purpose of drawing up a questionnaireshould the Sub-Committee consider this expedient - or as a basis ofdiscussion with a view to any recommendations which   the Sub-committee may  wish to submit concerning licensing systems in the future convention.     The Sub-Committee may possibly consider it advisable for the study of these questions to be preceded by a discussion of the ^vantages of  the systems of international or national licences aid  the intermediate solution of the standardisation of licences.
