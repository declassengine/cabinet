THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMECONFIDENTIAL.REPORT  ON  THE  SECOND MEETING  OF  THE  PREPARATORY    COMMITTEE  FOR THE  WORLD ECONOMIC  CONFERENCE.    WE beg  to  submit a  report on  the recent  meeting of the  preparatory committee for the World Economic Conference.                           I. OPENING MEETINGS.    1.  The Committee resumed its sittings on the 9th January at Geneva.    The membership  of the Committee  was set out in our  report  of the10th November,  with  the addition of  a Chinese representative, and later ofSir Cecil Kisch,  representing the Indian  Government.    The first day was occupied by a general discussion in which Sir frederick leith-Ross, who was asked  to open the Debate, made a plea for united actionon  a  broad front and summarised the conditions on which a  recovery  fromthe world depression seemed to depend as consisting essentially  of (a) a settle-ment  of war debts;  (b) monetary  reform; (c)  financial reconstruction;  and(d)  removal  of  trade barriers.   Speaking as an expert, he emphasised thedifficulties which would  attend  any  proposals for a  resumption  of the  goldstandard until very great progress had been secured under these heads,  moreparticularly  as there  had been a marked tendency of public  opinion in theUnited Kingdom to harden  against any return to an unreformed gold standardunder  present conditions.    The next  speech,  by Professor  Williams,  the American  expert  on the monetary Sub-Committee, suggested that during the interval between the meetingsof the Preparatory Commission a certain amount of progress had been made onthe American  side.   He accepted the fourfold classification suggested  bySir Frederick Leith-Ross, although indicating  that he  would himself somewhatalter the degree of emphasis put on different points and the timing of the varioussteps  to be taken.  He was personally of opinion that the essential contributions which the  United States could make  to world recovery would  be  a settlementof War Debts this year,  and some reduction of tariffs. He spoke also for thefirst time in  terms of approval  of  the reflation experiment  carried out in theearly  summer of last year in the  United States.  That experiment was, he  said,attended by many extraneous difficulties;  in particular, substantial withdrawalsof gold from New York by foreign Central Banks took place during its operation,while the hopes that its  authors had  entertained of a simultaneous balancingof the United States Budget were not fulfilled owing to the political situation.Despite these difficulties very considerable success  had attended the reflationpolicy.  Conditions in the United States ceased to deteriorate, surplus reserveswere accumulated by the United States banks, the contraction of  public depositswas checked, security prices were raised above the very low point they had reached,business ceased to contract and commodity prices enjoyed a definite rise, althoughit was true that later in the year there had been a rather disappointing fall.    The reflation experiment had attracted a  great deal  of criticism by  someeconomic  authorities in the United  States  as the apparent results certainlyappeared disappointing and there had  even been proposals made to reverse theoperation.  This  reactionary movement had not been  accepted by the UnitedStates authorities.   The present  position  would be held,  the Federal  Reserveneither increasing nor decreasing the volume of Government securities which theyacquired during the reflation campaign.  (It is to be hoped he is right on this.)Mr. Williams suggested that the  incoming administration  in the United states would  endeavour to secure further progress on somewhat similar lines by taking steps to deal with the agricultural situation and the restoration of confidence.    If, as he supposed, the depression  was entering  upon its  last phase, theessential object in his opinion before the Conference was to agree on the minimum       [8137]   [8229]  [8607]                                      b
  programme necessary to lift the world out of the depression.  He would pick out  for this purpose the key countries, England and Germany, and consider what  were the conditions necessary to enable them to stabilise their currencies.      Professor Rist (France), who spoke next, emphasised that the immediate task  of the  Preparatory  Commission  was to  prepare an agenda  for the World  Conference.   Until that  Agenda existed it was difficult for any French Govern-  ment  to decide upon a policy.  He thought that the picture drawn by Sir F.  Leith-Ross had been painted in darker colours than were  necessary.  He hoped  that the present phase of the depression was now at its worst.   In a period of  such general  instability the right policy was not to add to the general disorder  by those countries which were still on gold leaving the gold standard; he wished  to see all countries which had left the gold standard, in fact or in theory, return  as soon as possible.  If some of these countries believed it necessary that prices  should rise before their return, he could not disagree, though he doubted whether  any deliberate steps could be taken to secure a rise in prices.      Professor Rist thought that the World Economic Conference could deal  with international capital movements, financial reconstruction and to some extent  freer  circulation of goods.   He  mentioned as important  points  the  stillstand  arrangement  and  the adjustment  of long and  short-term indebtedness.  He  referred again  to the &quot;common fund&quot;  suggested  at Stresa by the French  Delegates for the  purpose  of strengthening the reserves  of central banks in  Eastern Europe.   As regards immediate measures, he was a warm supporter of  action to ensure  the  freer circulation of goods, though it  must be remembered  that when these  questions  were under  consideration each Government  was  specially liable  to find  itself  in  difficulties with  its Parliament  and its own  industrials.      2.  During the proceedings on the second day the Committee agreed to the  adoption of  Sir Cecil Kisch  as  a  representative of the  Indian  Government.  Mr. Lo, the Chinese Minister at  Copenhagen, had previously been  added to the  Preparatory  Committee at the desire of  the  American representative on the  Committee of Organisation.      A number of speeches by foreign representatives on the second day did not  advance matters very far, as they consisted mainly of attempts to raise small points  based on the discussions of the previous  day.  But, on the whole, they accepted  in principle  the analysis of  the  programme suggested in Sir F. Leith-Ross&apos;s  opening speech.      Sir Cecil Kisch described the Indian currency system and the effects of the  fall in the world prices there.      Sir Frederick Leith-Ross replied to some points raised in the discussion.  At the end  of this general meeting the Committee resolved itself into its two  parts, the Financial Sub-Committee and the Economic Sub-Committee.      3.  At its first meeting the  Financial Sub-Committee decided to break up  into two groups, to meet privately in order to discuss the Agenda and consider  the annotation  thereto,  for transmission  to the  Organising Committee.   The  first of these groups, consisting of Professor Rist, Dr.  Williams,  Dr.  Trip,  Mr. Tsushima, M. Baranski, Mr. Ryti and Sir Frederick Phillips, dealt with the  main question of monetary  policy and prices.  The second Committee, composed  of Herr Vocke, M. Francqui,  Mr. Fraser, Mr. Jahn, M.  Parmentier, Sir Cecil  Kisch and M. Musy, dealt with exchange restrictions, capital movements, &amp;c.      At the same  time the Economic  Sub-Committee began to prepare its draft.  At a rather later stage it was arranged\that the final Report should be in three  parts.  An introduction  prepared by Mr.  Day, U.S.A., and Signor Beneduce,  a  second  part  prepared by Sir Frederick  Leith-Ross and Professor Rist, setting  out the general programme before the Conference, and a  third part containing  the agenda and notes.                         II. REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE.              Introduction and General Programme (pages 5 to 9).*v      4.   The first  part  of  the Report, i.e., the  Introduction and the General  Programme  of the Conference,  were drawn up  in a form suitable for public                    * References throughout are to pages in the Leugue print.
consumption,  the  actual Agenda and  Annotations being  of  a more technicalcharacter and intended primarily for consideration by the Governments.     The Introduction, which was drafted by Mr. Day, calls for little comment.It summarises, in a series of brief and striking paragraphs, the main features of the present world situation.     5.  The general outline of the Programme for the  Conference, which follows,begins with a strong statement as  to  the necessity for a settlement of inter-Governmental Debts.  Though this  question  lies outside the terms of reference of the  Committee,  all the members,  including the American  representatives,agreed that the early resumption and successful conclusion of negotiations on thisquestion was essential.  &quot; Until there is such a settlement, these debts will remainan insuperable barrier to economic and financial reconstruction.&quot;     6.  After this  preliminary paragraph,  the  Committee  quote the list of questions  for  the  Conference-as set out in the  Lausanne Resolution,  beginning with the  Financial  questions  (Monetary  Policy,  Exchange  Controls,  Prices,Movement of Capital), and proceeding to the Economic questions (Tariff Policy,Quotas  and Producers&apos; Agreements).   Considerable discussion took place  as towhether this  order  should not be modified.   The  original draft prepared bySir F. Leith-Ross, and accepted not  only by Professor Rist  but also by Mr. Day,dealt with the general programme of the Conference in a different  order.  Itstressed first the need of greater freedom  of  trade; then passed to the questionof improving  prices, making mention in this connection of the possibilities ofbetter organisation of production; then  treated the questions of exchange controland  the need for freer movement of capital; and, finally, discussed the ultimatestabilisation of currencies.   Leakages took place in regard to this draft, and theAmerican Press  published articles to the effect that the Commission was pressing for reductions of tariffs, and was relegating the restoration of  the gold standardto a late and doubtful stage  of the  Programme.   Thereupon  the  Americanmembers,  with the support of  the President (Dr. Trip) and  the  Italian Vice-President (Signor  Beneduce), proposed a revision of the draft,  so as to deal withthe Programme in  the order given in the Lausanne Resolution.   No support couldbe obtained from the other members to the more  logical sequence which we wouldhave preferred,  and the document was  accordingly redrafted  on the last day soas to conform with the views of other members.  It was agreed,  however, to inserta statement that all  the questions were  inter-related and could not be  dealt withpiecemeal, and that  no particular importance was to  be attached to the precisemethod  of classification.     7.  A suggestion was also inserted in this part of the Report that the successof the Conference  would depend in great measure upon preliminary negotiationsbeing carried through between the participating Governments during the interval before the Conference can meet.   This suggestion was put forward by the LeagueSecretariat and  met with general support  from the members  of the Committee.As such a procedure has in fact been contemplated by His Majesty&apos;s Government,the British representatives raised no objection to the  suggestion in the Report,but they gave no indication of British intentions in the matter.     The Report  then proceeds to deal briefly with monetary stabilisation, the fallin prices, the question of exchange controls and international lending, and finallywith quotas and  tariff policy.  Under each head the  objectives to be attained are set out in broad outline so as to give a bird&apos;s-eye view of the whole field to be covered  and to place the task of the conference before public opinion in the  formof a positive programme.   But, of course, the objectives thus stated  are in no sense definite recommendations which the various Governments are committed to accepting, and in  regard particularly to the  question of the restoration of thegold standard the text of the  Report  fully safeguards our  position.              III. FINANCIAL ANNOTATIONS TO  THE AGENDA.   &apos; 8.   The opening of this Section  of  the Report is in substantial accord  withthe various declarations made at Ottawa.  The ultimate restoration of the goldstandard is envisaged: since  some form  of  international  monetary standard isdesirable and there is no-standard but gold which would command any sort of-general  assent..  Essential&apos; conditions for a return to gold are the restorationof equilibrium between prices and costs and&apos; the future stability  of the price level.      [8137]                                                     B 2
    It will be desirable to bring together the main references to the restoration ofthe gold standard contained in different parts of the Report:         &quot; In  the field of monetary and credit policy the objective must  be  the    restoration of  an effective monetary standard to  which the countries who    have abandoned the gold  standard can wisely adhere.   Each Government    must, of  course, remain free to decide when and  under what conditions it    could.adopt such a standard, and it is not suggested that this can or  should    be  done without the most careful preparation.  The  notes appended to  the    Report make it clear that many conditions, economic as well as financial,    must be fulfilled before the restoration of an international gold standard can    be a practical possibility.   Moreover, it will be necessary to provide effective    safeguards against such a restoration of the gold standard leading to a fresh    breakdown.  The question has  to be considered whether  measures can be    taken with the co-operation of the Central Banks on the lines suggested in    the Report of the Gold Delegation of the League of Nations to ensure a    greater stability of price levels in the future &quot; (page  8).        &quot; In  our view among the essential conditions ..(for a restoration of a free    gold standard)  are the restoration of equilibrium  between  prices and costs,    and, in the future,  such a reasonable degree of stability of prices as the world    measure of values should properly possess &quot; (page 12).        &quot; The time when it will be possible for a particular country to return to    the gold standard and the exchange parity at which such a  return can safely    be made will necessarily depend on the conditions in that country  as well as    those abroad,  and these questions  can only be determined  by the proper    authorities in each country separately &quot; (page 12).        &quot; We would lay stress upon what has already  been  indicated  in  the    Introduction that the solution of major outstanding political problems would    contribute to that  restoration of confidence without which great hesitation    will be felt in taking decisions  to return to  the gold standard &quot; (page 12).        &quot; A series of measures will have to be taken in order to make it possible    for countries whose reserves are at present  inadequate to attain a satisfactory    reserve position :         &quot; (a)  A settlement of inter-governmental  debts would be of  particular               value in this respect;        &quot; (&amp;)  A return to a reasonable degree of freedom in movement of goods               and  services;        &quot; (c)  A return to freedom in the foreign exchange markets and  in the               movement of capital&quot; (page 13).        &quot; When countries with deficient reserves return to the gold standard    the new parities should be such as to be consistent with a favourable balance.    of  payments and  so  attract  an adequate  reserve without  undue  effort&quot;    &quot; We attach great importance .... to the pursuance of consultationsamong Central Banks, particularly with a view to achieving the object as stated in the Report of the Gold Delegation of checking undue fluctuations in the purchasing  power  of  gold.   We are convinced,  as were  the GoldDelegation, that action should be based on international understanding andco-operation.  The  prospects  of the general restoration of a gold standard and  of its working in the future appear  to  depend in large measure  on progress in this field &quot; (page  17^.    These general conditions which apply to all countries  now  off the goldstandard  are sufficiently  sweeping to rule completely out of the picture anyreturn to an unreformed gold standard or any return at an unsuitable  rate ofexchange.    9.  Other  points of  interest in connection with the monetary side of theReport were (a) the question of prices and costs;  (6) attempts made to limit our freedom of action in handling the sterling exchange;  (c) general reforms of thegold standard and provision against instability of prices.    With regard to the general question of prices, the recent collapse of the  price level  is  referred  to  in  the  Introduction  (page 5),  and  in the Programme(page 17).
(page  8).  The consequent  dislocation  (unemployment,  increased  burden  ofindebtedness,  decline  of  national incomes,  budget deficits,  price  and  wagedisparities) are referred to in more detail in the annotations (page 18).  &quot;some increase  in the world  level of prices is highly desirable and would be the firstsign of world recovery &quot; (page 8).     &quot;A  general policy of easy money&quot;  is recommended  (page 8), and  this isfurther developed  in the  annotations where  it is  stated  to include low short-term rates of interest, an open market policy so far as market conditions and central Bank statutes permit, and a reduction  of long-term rates  of  interestby conversions and any other available methods (page 14)..     Among non-monetary methods, the restoring of equilibrium between prices and costs by  the reduction of wages is mentioned, but with a strong  hint of the obvious difficulties (page 19).  Limitation of  Supply  (page 19) is discussed in connection with those commodities to which it is applicable in Part VI of theannotations.     Budget equilibrium is recommended for all countries as a means of restoringconfidence (annotations, page 13).     The evils of over-taxation are insisted on, and those of excessive borrowing,e.g., for public works  (page  20).     10.  As  regards the actual control  of the  sterling  exchange,  determinedefforts  were made up to the last moment, more particularly by the Americans and germans, in  favour of recommending a policy of de facto  stabilisation for thosecurrencies, particularly sterling, which are off gold.  We naturally  raised the strongest objection to any reference in the Report to de facto stabilisation and weresupported in this by the French  representative, who agreed with, us  that it is amistaken policy for countries  off gold  to announce  publicly  their intentionto hold the exchange at any particular point or between  any particular points.No reference to the subject appears in the Report.     It cannot, of course, be denied that variations in the sterling exchange have some effect on gold prices,  but the words  actually  inserted  (page 13)  that&apos;: exchange fluctuations may hamper a monetary and economic policy  designed topromote  a recovery of  prices in gold countries &quot; are about  as weak as could havebeen chosen.  If,  in fact, gold  countries  were  actively  pursuing a policy  ofdeliberately raising prices, we should in our own interests be co-operating withthem as well  as we could on exchange matters as well as in other directions.     One  suggestion made  in the Report as to  the  management  of  sterling and other non-gold currencies in the  near future (page 14) is that efforts shouldbe made  to avoid a competition between States to acquire a temporary advantage in international trade  by depreciating the external value of their currency belowsuch a point as is  required  to re-establish internal equilibrium.   The Germansmade the strongest effort to  delete this qualification, but were defeated.  Whilethe passage  might have some conceivable application to Chili  or Japan it hasnone whatever to  Great Britain, since consistently with  its terms the  sterlingexchange might stand a long way below its current rate.  The  passage which follows in the Report advocating the smoothing  out of  fluctuations  due  tospeculative movements is entirely satisfactory to us.     11.  As regards the general reforms of the gold standard very great progress was made in securing acceptance of more  enlightened views on currency matters.The concentration of  gold  in each country in the hands of its Central Bankis welcomed.  The principle is stated that gold reserves are now primarilyrequired to meet an external drain caused by some temporary disequilibrium onthe balance of payments (and by inference are not required to  meet internal demands for gold).  The reduction of legal minimum gold reserves  to substantially below the customary 33 or 40 per cent, is advocated.     The gold exchange standard and various minor plans for economising gold are referred  to. The distribution of  monetary reserves is  referred to in  a fairly satisfactory passage (page 16).   Central Banks holding  large reserves are urged not to attempt to counteract redistribution by credit restriction.     The most important point of all these is the co-operation of Central Banks with a view to preventing undue fluctuations in the purchasing power of gold (page  17).     The main interest of the United Kingdom on the assumption that the gold standard will ultimately be  restored  is to safeguard the national economy  from
the disastrous effects of wide  fluctuations in the purchasing  power  of  gold.As this seemed  one of the matters of primary importance we suggested to the monetary Sub-Committee a  tentative draft  of a formal  statement which theCentral Banks might make as to their intentions in this respect.  The Bank ofFrance are the main opponents to progress on these lines and have  successfullyblocked international co-operation for several years past.  While other central banks are in varying degrees sceptical of the possibility of controlling gold pricesthey are on the whole not unwilling to see the attempt made.  The banking authori-ties in the United States are  almost certainly favourable to an attempt to controlgold prices, but the difficulty  is that they are nervous of public declarations whichmight lead to criticisms of their financial  operations in Congress.    The declaration we proposed, which had been agreed in substance in advancewith  the Bank  of England,  was accepted by the  Drafting  Committee (GreatBritain, United States and France).  The representatives of the  Bank for Inter-national Settlements, while   agreeing  in   principle with  what was  proposed,deprecated any actual text being suggested  by the Preparatory Committee. the decisive  factor  in the end  was that the  American representative,  ProfessorWilliams, while accepting our draft, expressed a strong desire that instead of thePreparatory  Committee publishing  the  draft he should be allowed to present it and discuss it with the Federal Reserve Board.    We accordingly agreed to the passage  as it stands in  the Report (page 17)which calls attention to the reference to stabilisation of prices contained in theGold  Delegation Report and the acceptance  of that Report by the Bank  for Inter-national Settlements and to  the necessity for the Central Banks to pursue theirconsultations with a view to  international understanding and  co-operation.  Wesecured the addition of  a passage that  the prospect of  a general  restoration ofgold  and of its  successful working in the future depended in large measure on progress in this field.    What  will  actually happen on this  matter before the  Conference meetsdepends on the  progress which Professor Williams can make with  the federal reserve Board.    The discussion of  the matter at the  Bank for international settlements can be arranged at any time,  but we thought it better to arrangeprivately that that should not take  place until the view of the  Federal ReserveBoard had been obtained.    12.  Other points of interest on the monetary and credit  side are :     Silver  (page 17). The report rejects as impractical the idea of introducingbimetallism and  rejects equally the  suggestion that Banks of  Issue  should beallowed to hold increased quantities of silver in their  legal  reserves.    It deals at some length  with suggestions as to  Governmental  action for thepurpose of improving the price of silver, such as the substitution  of silver coinsfor Bank notes.   In fact all  this comes to very little.    The Report,  with  the  concurrence of the  Chinese representative, statesunequivocally that trade interests with China would best be served not by a risein the price of  silver as such, but by a rise in the general level  of commodity prices.    A bolition of Foreign Exchange Restrictions (page 20). The  annotationsdeal at some length with the question of foreign exchange controls.  These controlsconstitute,  as the Sub-Committee say,  &quot; an  almost insuperable obstacle to the circulation of capital.&quot;  But a return to normal conditions presupposes actionto restore the equilibrium of the exchanges.    Short-term  Debts (page  21). rOwing  to the memory of  post-war currencycollapses, public opinion in Central Europe  is desperately afraid of any exchange depreciation, and the exchange controls were largely adopted in  order to prevent such  depreciation as the result  of large withdrawals of short-term credits, suchas took place in  1930 and 1931.  The first step towards the abolition  of exchangecontrols, therefore, must be to find some safeguard against massive withdrawals ofcapital.  This was the object of the standstill arrangements adopted in Germany,Austria  and  Hungary.  But,  in  fact, these arrangements  have  not workedsatisfactorily, and, so long as they are maintained,  no one will willingly investmoney in the countries concerned.   What is needed is to restore liquidity, so thatcreditors  will willingly  maintain  their credit  lines.   This may  involve the consolidation of some of the frozen industrial or  State credits into  long-term
loans; but this cannot be done with Bank acceptances, in which the London marketis primarily interested.   Discussions are proceeding between  the  debtors andcreditors concerned, and Government intervention is undesirable as being likelyto reduce the chances of direct agreement between*the two parties.  The Germansat one time appeared disposed to press that the question  should be put before theConference for settlement, but in the end agreed to the statement that the settle-ment of the question &quot; is essentially the  concern of the creditors and the debtorsthemselves.   It is nevertheless important for Governments that a solution shouldbe found for this problem,  which undoubtedly affects both the monetary and thecommercial policy of the country &quot; (page 22).   From our point of view, too, it is satisfactory  that  the Sub-Committee  recognise the  difference between  realcommercial acceptances and other bank credits, and state that the readjustmentof these debts &quot; should have the effect of liberating real commercial acceptancesas soon as possible from any form of regulation &quot; (page 21).    Long-term Debts (page 22). While the withdrawal of short-term capitalhas been the main cause of exchange regulations,  a number of countries  areunable in present conditions to meet  the burden of their long-term debts, and therepresentatives of these  countries, supported by  the French, recommended that action should be taken to &quot; readjust,&quot; i.e., write down, these debts.  The Frenchare interested in this question because many of the debtor countries concerned aretheir allies and most of the existing  loans to Eastern Europe have been providedby the British  and  xlmeriean markets;  if the existing debts  were now scaleddown, there might be openings for fresh loans  by French capital.  On the otherhand, the United Kingdom, as  one  of the principal creditor countries, has no interest in accepting permanent readjustments of these debts until  it is clear thatthe present price level cannot be altered.  Our attitude  was therefore that thisquestion also should be settled between the creditors and debtors  concerned andthat  no uniform solution could be arrived at which would cover all cases.  TheSub-Committee accepted  this view, but added, first,  that the bondholders shouldbe encouraged to group themselves in associations in  order to be able  to negotiateeffectively, and, secondly, that it might facilitate such negotiations if a list ofpersons of recognised standing and competence were drawn up whose mediationwould be open  to the parties concerned.  There seems  no  great  harm  in this,though it  is not likely that the  British  bondholders will have recourse to suchmediation.    International Public Works  (page 23). Reference is also made to the schemesfor International Public Works (chiefly roads  and bridges) in  Poland and the balkan countries which  have been  put  forward  by the International LabourOffice.  Whatever may be said for public  works  schemes as a means of expandingcredit internally, it  is quite clear that there is no prospect of  financing inter-national public works schemes in  the Balkans  as the countries in question are quite unable to raise foreign loans for much  more urgent purposes, and theCommittee were agreed that the  I.L.O. proposals were useless and  impracticable.But the I.L.O. have  succeeded in making much political  capital out of  theseproposals  and  intimated that  they  intended  to raise the question  at theConference.    Resumption of movement of capital (page 22). Even  if the indebtednessof the countries in  difficulty can be  readjusted, their exchange  position will beprecarious until the capital already withdrawn can be replaced.   The resumptionof the normal flow of credit throughout the world is accordingly  essential ifwe are to secure the abolition at any early date of exchange controls.   the references in the Report to this question (pages  22 and 23) are of importance.   The Report first refers  (at  the instance of  the French representative) tothe &quot; Common Fund &quot; for monetary stabilisation which emerged  from the Stresa&quot;conference.  This is a small scheme  for helping the Central Banks of countriesn  Eastern Europe by small loans a pill to  cure  an earthquake.  The Belgianepresentative put forward  some more comprehensive suggestions, but did noteduce them to any settled plan.   A far more hopeful line of approach to this aspect of the case is referred toin the General Programme, as follows :         &quot; The restoration of free exchanges is so essential to  the recovery of   financial confidence and to the resumption of the normal flow of international   credit that  the  Governments should consider  whether they cannot expedite
    the process.  In order to do this some means might be organised  by which    resources at present  immobilised would be put into active circulation and    stabilisation credits would be provided under appropriate  conditions to the    countries which require  such assistance &quot; (page 8).    The question is further developed in the annotations as to  the possibility of creating an  International  Institute  of Credit.    It has  become  increasinglyapparent that the restarting  of  normal capital movements which have been suspended  for so long will require some special stimulus, and to achieve this  itwill in  all  probability be necessary that co-operative Government aid  should insome form be extended.   This is the  first occasion in which any such suggestionhas figured in an International document.  We did  not think it desirable at thisstage to enter into details regarding  the manner by which  the  suggested CreditInstitution could be financed or by which the distribution of its funds would bearranged.  In our view,  however, the suggestion might have great value if the financing could  be effected in the main by the Governments of countries whoseCentral  Banks hold excessive  gold reserves, and if the financing could  be so arranged as to call into active use the credit capacity now unemployed  in such a manner as to promote the redistribution of gold.  Such a scheme, if it could becarried  into  effect  on  right  lines, would contribute materially towards raisingworld  prices.  The Report  suggests that, if the  idea  of creating the Inter-national Institute of Credit meets with the approval  of Governments, the question should be gone into more fully (page 23).  The question of what would be the mosthopeful  line  of procedure  in  developing this  idea would  obviously  require consideration.                IV. ECONOMIC ANNOTATIONS TO THE AGENDA.           (a) Restoration of  International Trade  (pages  23 to 27).    13.  This section  deals with Prohibitions, Quotas and the economic aspectsof Exchange Controls  and of the clearing, compensation and barter agreements to which they have given rise in fact, what may  be  described as the specialcrisis restrictions.  These questions  had been very  fully discussed at  the first session of  the Committee, and the Report resumes the conclusions reached.  TheSub-Committee  are  unanimous  in   regarding  these  restrictions as whollyundesirable,  and  consider that  the   Conference should aim  at  their  generalabolition.  But  these measures are largely the result of the financial dislocationand currency instability which  at  present prevails, and  their  abolition must therefore depend on the  possibility of remedying the causes which give rise tothem.    In  this part of the Report the only points of substance on which the british representative had to secure amendments were three  :     (a)  A  mention was introduced in the Report  of the  serious repercussionswhich the quota system, as practised  on the Continent,  has on commercial policy by rendering the most-favoured-nation provisions of existing treaties to a largeextent ineffective in regard to commodities covered  by quotas.  This point is ofsome importance, owing to the tendency of countries which apply quotas to use them  as a bargaining  weapon  in  order to secure  reductions  of tariffs.  this procedure  was adopted by the Germans in  the recent coal negotiations, andHerr Posse, the German  member of  tjhe Sub-Committee, hinted that this was adefinite policy on their part.    (&amp;)  The   first  draft had  passed over  practically without mention the increasing  difficulties to trade caused  by the clearing agreements now fashionablethroughout Europe.  In the  discussions, a paragraph was  inserted stating thatthese  clearing agreements had  a particularly disruptive  effect owing to theirtendency to give a purely bilateral character to international  trade.    On thisquestion the British view was strongly supported by the American member.    (c)  The original  draft, devoted a large space to the discussion of what is called &quot; Indirect Protectionism,&quot; such as Merchandise Marks, Veterinary restric-tions, &amp;c,  and the policy of  the United Kingdom on these points was  criticised by the German and French members.   These criticisms were suitably dealt withand in the  end the Sub-Committee agreed to confine itself to a short reference tothese questions, which are clearly of secondary importance and should not call for detailed consideration  by the Conference.
                (b) Tariffs and Treaty Policy (pages 26 to 31).    14.  This section gave rise to much more difficulty.  The draft was entrusted to Herr Posse (who, on many occasions, caused difficulties by his self-opinionatedbearing and often showed  a distinctly anti-British bias).   He produced a veryone-sided and contentious document which had practically to be rewritten to meetthe views of other members of the Sub-Committee.   The original draft pressed inimperative terms for the conclusion either of an absolutely general agreement byall Governments to reduce their tariffs or failing that of  a general  agreementadmitting  collective arrangements for reductions of tariffs between  groups of countries as a derogation from the M.F.N. clause.   The Sub-Committee as a whole were ready to urge the desirability of a general reduction of excessive tariffs, butthey were  not prepared  to commit themselves to  precise measures.    The diffi-culties of securing any widespread international  agreement on this matter arevery real.  The  countries which have  built up their existing industrial organi-sation on the basis of high protection are naturally afraid that any reduction inthe level of that protection may result in their markets being flooded with imports,especially from countries with lower costs or depreciated currencies.    Moreover,the extreme complication and the  lack of standardisation of present day  tariffsmakes the application of any absolutely rigid formula very difficult to agree uponand very inequitable in its effects.   On the other hand the adoption  of collective agreements might easily  divide the world up into conflicting groups of nations and lead to even more acute economic antagonism than exists at present.    The Report, as finally agreed, gives a reasonably fair statement of the variouslines of action which may  be adopted  to bring about tariff reductions, togetherwith a summary of the relevant considerations as regards each method.    15.  As  regards the various alternative  procedmes, the American member(Mr. Day)  pointed  out that  besides the alternatives suggested in the original draft, reductions might equally well be made by autonomous action or by bilateral agreements.  He repeated what his colleague had stated at the Plenary meeting to the  effect  that  he had  great  hopes that the United  States would effect  asubstantial reduction in their tariffs, but he indicated that this was much more likely to be done by autonomous action or by bilateral  agreements than by anyother method. (In private conversation he said that he thought it most unlikelythat the  United States Government would agree to any derogation from  most-favoured-nation  rights in  favour  of  collective agreements,  such as  the  OuchyConvention, for a  reduction  of duties between  a group  of countries.)   TheItalians indicated very definitely that they thought the only prospect of securingreductions  of tariffs was  by means of bilateral negotiations, and they showed no interest in  the discussion of collective agreements.  It was finally agreed that theReport should emphasise the  need for a reduction of tariffs and add that theprocedure for attaining this object was not of capital importance.    While most  of the countries represented were  firm in their adherence to themost-favoured-nation  principle  (including  even Germany,  which neverthelessdesires an  exception for  &quot;collective agreements&quot;), the French Government are apparently seeking to alloy the principle with a large measure of &quot; reciprocity,&quot;and the French representative stated that public opinion in his country regardsthe most-favoured-nation clause  (however  wrongly) as largely responsible  fortheir  troubles.  In  this  connection,  it may  be remarked  that,  while  thePreparatory  Committee  is urging action which  will result in an extensive&quot; consolidation &quot; (or fixing by treaty) of  moderate rates of duty,  the FrenchGovernment are  at the moment moving in the opposite direction, and have quiterecently  negotiated modifications  of two of  their most important  commercial treaties those with Germany and Italy so as to  give them back their freedom to increase the large  number  of tariff rates which were consolidated by  thosetreaties,  and  are also contemplating further  increases of  tariff as part of  theprogramme for balancing their Budget.    16.  The question of derogations from the most-favoured-nation clause gave rise to  much discussion.  The Sub-Committee  agreed that the unconditional andunrestricted application  of the most-favoured-nation  clause should  in  normal circumstances form the  basis of  commercial  relations between nations.   TheItalian and Argentine  representatives wished  to go further and were opposed toany derogations.  On the other hand, the Germans and French were prepared to      [8137]                                                        c
admit  derogations, particularly in favour of special preferences  for the cerealexports of the Danubian countries recommended by the Stresa Conference.  This,in fact, remains one of the burning questions of  European commercial  relations at the  moment.  The British representative  maintained the attitude previouslytaken,  viz.,  that His  Majesty&apos;s Government  were prepared  to  consider  such proposals on merits, but  could  not enter into any general commitment on thematter and considered  that wider measures are required to remedy effectively thedifficulties of the cereal-producing countries.    The German representative made a particularly audacious suggestion thatthe Commission should declare that anti-dumping measures  were contrary tothe most-favoured-nation clause, but, on the other hand, that countervailing dutiesagainst countries with depreciated currencies should be recognised as admissible.The proposal, however, finds no place in the  Report.          (c)  Organisation of Production and Trade (pages 31 to  34).    17.  This section  did not disclose great differences  of opinion among theSub-Committee,  but there was some  divergence of views as to its importance.    It was generally recognised that the Conference ought to  consider how farmeasures for  the  organisation  of production might  help  to  maintain prices,particularly as regards commodities of which  large stocks are overhanging the markets.  But as  before,  the  Italians were  anxious to safeguard the  interestsof consumers and the Financial Sub-Committee in their Report showed consider-able hostility to regulation of production as tending to prevent economic forces from operating and thus in the  long run making matters  worse.   The EconomicSub-Committee concentrated its attention on  two or three cases,  particularlywheat, timber and coal.  As regards wheat, the American member stated thatthe incoming United States Administration will take great interest in any stepsto secure an international agreement for the  limitation of production and/orexport of wheat (about which previous United States Administrations have raiseddifficulties),  and the Argentine member had submitted, on behalf of his Govern-ment, suggestions to the same end.  Special prominence is therefore given to thisquestion.  The case for Government  regulation of wheat production differs, ofcourse,  from that  of industrial products in  that, while in  the latter cases  anyregulation  is  generally considered to be a  matter best  left  to  the producersconcerned to arrange, such action cannot be looked for in the case of wheat owingto the  vast number of scattered and unorganised producers who  are concerned.Some form  of intervention by Governments therefore appears indispensable ifsuch an agreement is to be realised.    18.  Briefer references are made to the possible  consideration by Govern-ments of similar action in cases  of coal and timber.  So far as  coal is concerned,it is probable that some kind  of international agreement will  eventually  benecessary if the industry is to be put back on a stable basis, and the German andFrench members urged that the Conference should examine this  question  witha.view to overcoming the  opposition of the British  coal producers.  The Britishowners have taken up the standpoint  that they will not  resume  discussions foran  international agreement unless and until the quotas imposed on British coalin Germany, France and Belgium are removed; but to this the foreign countries concerned reply that they will not be able to remove their quotas till some inter-national agreement is reached.   His Majesty&apos;s Government will have to considerseriously what policy it will adopt on tJhis question at the Conference,  where itseems certain to come up.  The depreciation of sterling in terms  of gold currencieshas put the British industry, at any rate temporarily, in a better position  than before vis-a-vis its  foreign competitors; but,  as against this, it  needs to be  borne in mind that this advantage may be speedily nullified by future events,  and thatin any case,  quotas, exchange restrictions, &amp;c, in  foreign countries have  gonefar to prevent the United Kingdom industry from making its  enhanced  com-petitive power effective.  One of the difficulties in the way of an internationalcoal agreement is  the lack of adequate organisation amongst the  coal exportersin this country,  and it seems improbable that this lack of organisation can be remedied without Government intervention.    19.  During the discussions  on  this  part of the programme the british representative raised the question of Shipping  Subsidies,  and urged  that the
oConference should consider the abolition of all Government subsidies to shipping,on the ground that they have contributed materially to the present depression,and have hit the British shipping industry, which enjoys no such artificial aid,with special severity.  &quot;While there was some opposition on this point, particularly from the American member,  the  French representative gave it strong support,although his Government is one of those that give subsidies.  He urged that thisinter-governmental competition, based on considerations of &quot; prestige,&quot;  was aserious obstacle to the efforts to balance budgets.    20.   At the last meeting of the Economic Sub-Committee, the German memberproposed the inclusion in its report of a paragraph as follows :  &apos;&apos; There is a striking contrast  between the grave crisis of unemployment and  the fact thatthere exist in the world large territories which would afford the opportunity ofemployment to nationals of States not possessing Colonies.&quot;  To this the Britishmember replied that Great Britain herself had  much  unemployment, notwith-standing the fact that a large amount of territory in the Empire was capable offurther development, and that this suggestion had clearly no real connexion withthe work of the Preparatory Committee.  The question was raised again beforethe final Plenary Meeting, but the Chairman was induced to rule it out as being a political matter which did  not  fall within  the  terms of  reference of  theCommittee.  Notwithstanding this  ruling, it may be  expected  that the GermanGovernment will try to raise the question at the World Conference, if only for internal political  purposes.                              V. CONCLUSION.    21.   During this, as during the previous Session, our relations with the other delegations were uniformly  harmonious and  we continued  to work in close co-operation with the American representatives, despite some differences, e.g., inregard to the question of the  gold standard and to shipping subsidies.   Thegeneral atmosphere of the discussions, both in the full Committee and in the twoSub-Committees, was distinctly more businesslike than at the last  Session.  TheCommittee settled down  quickly to  a serious study  of the  questions  before it, and the  fact that it had  to  report before the 24th  January helped inthis  direction.   The  questions  that  will  have  to be   tackled  by  theConference were examined with a definite desire  to find positive solutions.  Thearguments   which we  presented,  although  frequently  unpalatable  to - therepresentatives of the gold standard  countries, were listened to with close attention and  received  more  consideration  than  might have  been anticipated.    TheCommittee did not discuss the  date of the Conference,  and the general feeling,as expressed in private conversations, was  still that it would be a mistake toconvoke the Conference until debts had been settled and until a basis of agreement on other questions was assured.  But the  impression was left on our minds thatthe prospects of getting results at the  Conference are distinctly  more hopefulthan they seemed last November.

Part I.A.  INTRODUCTION.    The Preparatory Commission of Experts has been given the task of preparing a draftannotated agenda for the forthcoming Monetary and Economic Conference.  In under-taking this task, we have been guided by the terms of reference transmitted to us by theCouncil of the League of Nations, and by certain preliminary discussions recorded in theFinal Act  of the Lausanne Conference.  This Conference, having arrived at far-reaching decisions with regard to the pressing problem of reparations payments, invited the Leagueof Nations to convoke a World Conference  &quot; to decide upon the  measures to solve theother economic and financial difficulties which are  responsible for, and  may  prolong,the present world crisis &quot;.  In this message from Lausanne, we have found the clearestindication of our general mandate.    Before setting forth the problems which require solution, we wish to  call attentionto the gravity of the situation with which the world is confronted.    Unemployment has recently been estimated by the  International Labour Office asinvolving  at least thirty million workers.  Even this huge total, which does not includethe workers&apos;  families or other dependants, is  probably an  underestimate.  The burdenof suffering  and  demoralisation  resulting  from unemployment of such  proportions  isappalling.    Wholesale commodity prices expressed in gold have declined since October 1929by roughly a  third; raw material  prices on  the  average  by 50 to  60  per cent.  Inthe middle of December, at Winnipeg, the price of wheat  fell to the lowest  level recorded in any primary market for wheat during the past four centuries.  Such  price-declineshave  produced profound disturbances in the economic system.  They  have throwncompletely out of adjustment prevailing costs  of the various factors of production, havemade business enterprise  generally unremunerative, and  have  seriously disorganisedpractically all the world markets.    World stocks of  agricultural products  and of other raw materials continue to accumulate.   The index of world stocks for 1932 was double that  for 1925.  Huge accu-mulations thus overhang some of the principal markets and burden the processes of orderlyprice readjustment.     Industrial production has been drastically curtailed, particularly in those  tradesproducing capital equipment.  The depths which have been reached  in some instancesare illustrated by the position of the  United States steel industry, which,  at the close  of1932, was operating at only  10 per cent of capacity.    The international flow of goods,  hindered by currency disorders and restricted bya  multiplicity of new goyemmental  interventions, has been reduced to  incredibly lowlevels.  The total value of world trade in the third quarter of 1932 was only about one-third of that  in the corresponding period of 1929.  The fall during the three-year  period was  continuous.
    Moreover, the quantum of goods in foreign trade appears to have fallen by at least25 per cent; by far the largest fall on record.    As a result of price-declines and the fall in the volume of production and trade,national incomes in many countries have fallen, it is estimated, by more than 40 per cent.The revenues of Governments, as a  consequence, have suffered sharp reductions, whileexpenditures have shown no corresponding decline.  The inevitable result has been aseries of budget deficits which, in some cases, have reached unprecedented proportions.    Only a handful of countries now retain free and uncontrolled gold-standard currencysystems.  Almost half the countries of the world are off the gold standard, and, in someforty  countries, exchange restrictions have been imposed.    Currency disorganisation, price-declines, curtailment of trade have thrown  into sharprelief  the vast  and difficult problems of indebtedness  with which many, if  not most,countries  are confronted.  As  matters now stand, there are countries &quot;the total valueof whose export trade has fallen below the sums required for external debt service alone.    Facts such as these indicate the extremities  to  which the  forces of disintegrationhave already carried the  economic and financial world.  Further losses of ground cannotbe contemplated  without the gravest forebodings.  Happily, in some  quarters, therehave  recently been certain auguries  of improvement.   Thus security markets in  almost every country have for several months past shown some resistance, despite discouragements.In the set-back which followed the slight revival after Lausanne, the security markets,unlike the commodity markets, did not lose  all the gains that had been made.  It is evident that more favourable monetary conditions,  technical  economic readjustmentsand reviving confidence  are being currently interpreted by those who assume the risks of investment as affording the possibility of a genuine change for the better in the economicsituation.    Nevertheless,  recovery will be  halting and restricted if unaccompanied by broadmeasures of reconstruction.   Three years of world-wide  dislocation have generated avast network of restraints upon the normal conduct  of business.  In the field of inter-national trade, prohibitions,  quotas, clearing agreements,  exchange  restrictions to mention only some of the most widely employed forms of regulation throttle businessenterprise  and individual initiative.  Defensively intended, and in many  instancesforced by unavoidable monetary and financial emergencies, these measures have developedinto a state of virtual economic  warfare.  It is not only in the field of trade that thistension exists.  In the difficult sphere of international  monetary and currency relations and in the world capital markets, free international co-operation has given place to complex and harassing regulations designed to safeguard national interests.  If a full and durablerecovery is to be effected, this prevailing conflict of national economies must be resolved.    The measures to be adopted to this end constitute the problem which the governments must shortly face in London.  In essence, the necessary programme is one of economicdisarmament.  In the movement towards economic reconciliation, the armistice was signed at Lausanne;  the London Conference must draft the Treaty of  Peace.  Failurein this critical undertaking threatens a world-wide adoption of ideals of national self-sufficiency which cut unmistakably athwart the lines  of economic development.  Sucha choice would shake the whole system of international finance to its foundations, standards of iiving would be lowered and  the  social system as we know it could hardfy survive.These developments,  if they occur, will be the result, not of any inevitable natural law,but of the faiiure of human will and intelligence to devise the necessary guarantees ofpolitical and economic international order.  The responsibility of Governments is clear and inescapable.
B.  GENERAL PROGRAMME  OF  THE CONFERENCE.      The programme of reconstruction which we deem it necessary for Governments to undertake is  set out below.   In this programme,  the  problem of inter-Governmental indebtedness  has not been included, because it lies outside our terms of reference. In our opinion, however, it is essential that this question shall be settled and that the settle- ment shall relieve the world of further anxiety  concerning the disturbing effects of such payments upon financial, economic and currency stability. Until there is such a settle- ment, or the definite prospect of such a settlement, these debts will remain an insuperable barrier to economic and  financial  reconstruction.   We therefore  attach  the greatest importance to the early resumption and successful conclusion of negotiations upon this problem.     The main questions for the Conference, as set out in the Lausanne resolution of July 15th, 1932, were as follows:         (a)   Financial questions:             Monetary  and  credit policy;             Exchange difficulties;             The level  of prices;             The movement of capital.         (b)   Economic questions:             Improved  conditions of production and trade interchanges, with particular        attention to:                 Tariff policy;                 Prohibitions  and restrictions of importation and  exportation, quotas             and other barriers to trade;                 Producers&apos; agreements.    Before embarking upon a discussion of these questions, it is necessary to emphasise the close interconnection between the various elements of the problem.   It will not, in our judgment, be possible to  make substantial progress by piecemeal measures.  A policy of &quot; nibbling &quot; will not solve this crisis.  We believe that the  Governments of the world must  make up their minds to achieve  a broad solution by concerted action along the whole front. Action in the  field of economic  relations depends largely upon monetary and financial action, and  vice versa.  Concerted measures in both fields are essential if progress is to  be made in either.  While we have kept roughly to the order set out in the Lausanne  resolution, we attach  no particular importance to  the precise method of classification.    In stressing the necessity for concerted action, we do not wish to suggest that nothing can&apos;be accomplished before the Conference meets.  On the contrary, the success of the Conference will depend  in great measure upon the vigour with which the participating Governments enter upon preliminary negotiations in the meantime.  The prospects of substantial  all-round success in  the necessarily complex and multilateral  conference discussions will be greatly enhanced if, in the intervening months, preliminary negotia-tions  have cleared  the  way for  reciprocal  concessions.
    The principal questions which the Governments have to consider can be summarisedas follows:    i.  In the field of monetary and credit policy, the objective must be the restorationof an effective international monetary standard  to which  the countries which  have abandoned the gold standard can wisely adhere.   Each Government must, of course,remain free to decide when and under what conditions it could adopt such a standard,and we do not suggest that this can or should be done without the most careful preparation.The notes appended clearly show that there are a great number of economic as well as financial conditions which must be  fulfilled, before  the  restoration of an  internationalgold standard can be  a practical possibility.  Moreover, it will be necessary to provideeffective safeguards against such a restoration of the gold standard leading  to a  freshbreakdown.  The question has to be considered whether measures can be taken, withthe co-operation of Central Banks on the lines of the recommendations  suggested inthe report  of the Gold Delegation of the League of Nations, to ensure a greater stability of price-levels in the future.    2.  The unprecedented fall of commodity prices in recenkyears has caused a growingdisequiiibrium between costs  and prices, has immensely increased the real  burden  of alldebts and fixed charges, has made business more and more unprofitable, and has resultedin a continuous and disastrous increase of unemployment throughout the world.   some increase in the level of world prices is highly desirable and would be the first sign of worldrecovery.   The Conference will no doubt wish to explore all possibilities of counteractingthis fall in prices.  One of the methods that should be considered is the continuation anddevelopment, where monetary conditions permit, of a general policy of easy moneydesigned to promote a healthy expansion of business.    At  the same time,  the question requires to be  considered  whether, particularly inthe case of certain primary commodities where large stocks are overhanging the markets,a better level of prices could not be obtained by the regulation  of exports or production.Such an arrangement coufd be of speciai importance in the case of wheat, the cultivation of which represents the  livelihood of a large proportion of mankind.    Of course, any rise in prices which might be obtained by such means can, in the longrun, be maintained only by a  general improvement of trade such as would follow from theabolition of present-day restrictions and the restoration of financial confidence.    3.  The abolition of exchange restrictions is an essentiai condition of world recovery.For this purpose, the Governments concerned must take the internal measures necessaryto secure the stability of their budgets and of  their economic systems.  In some cases,however, these efforts will not be sufficient so long as there is a mass of short-term foreigndebts, which may at any moment be withdrawn; in other cases, even  the service of thelong-term foreign debts entails great difficulties.  These difficulties will require carefultreatment.  The objective must be to restore the  confidence of the foreign  lendingmarkets, and much depends on the future level of prices.    It may be hoped that, if appropriate  action is taken on these points, the markets ofthe creditor countries may soon be in a position to resume  lending operations; but, inview of the general breakdown of international confidence, the process may well be a slowone.  The restoration of free exchanges is so essential to the recovery of financial confidence and to the resumption of the normal flow of international credit that the  governments should consider whether they cannot expedite the process.  In order to do this, some means might be organised by which resources at present immobilised would be put intoactive circulation, and stabilisation credits would be provided under appropriate conditions for the countries which  require such assistance.
    4.  Finally, there must be greater freedom of international trade.   It has alreadybeen pointed out that one of the most significant features of the present crisis is the fallwhich has taken place, not only in the value, but  in the quantum of world trade.   Thisfail has been partly caused, and has certainly been intensified, by the growing network of restrictions which have been imposed on  trade during recent years.  Every countryseeks to defend its economy  by imposing restrictions on imports, which in the end involvea contraction in its exports.  All seek to sell but not to buy.  Such a policy must inevitably lead to an increasing paralysis of international trade.   Governments should set themselvesto re-establish the normal interchange of commodities.    In the first instance, every effort should be made to secure a  general agreement forthe progressive relaxation,  and the complete abrogation at the earliest possible date,of the emergency measures prohibitions, quotas, etc. imposed as a result of the crisis.At the same time,  it will be  necessary for the Governments to reconsider recent economictendencies in so far as these are reflected in excessive tariffs, and to arrive at understandingsfor the moderation and stabilising of tariff policies in the future.  Action in this directionhas an intimate bearing upon the stabilisation of currencies, as it is impossible to maintain an international monetary system except on the basis of an international economic system.The great creditor nations have a special responsibility in this respect.    Such is the general  outline of the problems before the Conference as we see  them.    An annotated  agenda containing detailed suggestions for their solution and indicating the technical difficulties involved will be found in Part II.    We should like to emphasise the fact that, in  formulating this programme, we havebeen dominated by the  desire to find effective and  enduring remedies  for the presentdepression and for the unemployment which  weighs so heavily on  the whole world. Webelieve that partial remedies in  this field will not be successful.  What is needed is a comprehensive programme of world reconstruction, and  this should be carried through as rapidly as possible, so as to strengthen the forces which are now working towards recovery.We have here presented  such a programme.  We would  not give the  impression that theadoption of this programme  could deliver the world at a stroke from the difficulties underwhich it is now labouring. But, if the Governments are prepared to undertake it, and alsoto settle political questions which lie outside the scope of the Conference, we believe thatconfidence and prosperity can be restored.

The Lausanne Conference laid special emphasis on the necessity of restoring cur-currencies to a healthy basis and, in this connection, the restoration of a satisfactory  inter-national monetary standard is clearly of primary importance.   The World Conference,in the absence of  another international standard likely to be universally acceptable,will have to consider how the conditions for a successful restoration of a free gold standardcould be fulfifled.  In our view, among the essential conditions, which are discussed more fully below, are the restoration of equilibrium between prices and costs and, in the future,such a  reasonable  degree  of stability of prices as the world  measure  of  value should properly possess.    The time when it will be possible  for a particular country to return to the goldstandard and the exchange parity at  which such a return can safely be made will neces-sarily depend on the conditions in that country as well as those abroad, and these questionscan only be determined by the proper  authorities in each country separately.    In  the following sections, we set forth a series  of suggestions of a general naturewhich would seem calculated to facilitate the work of the Conference on the monetaryside.  It will be found that some of these suggestions can only be put into effect  throughconcerted action, while others call for the individual effort of particular countries.      1.  Conditions under which a Restoration of a  Free International Gold Standard                                 woidd be possible.    (a)   We would lay stress upon what has already been indicated in the Introduction  that the  solution of major outstanding political problems would  contribute  to thatrestoration of confidence without which great hesitation will be felt in taking decisions to return to the gold standard.
    (b)   In the second place, a series of measures would have to be taken in order tomake it  possible  for  countries whose reserves are at present  inadequate to attain asatisfactory reserve position:         (i)  A settlement, of inter-Governmental  debts  would be of particular value    in this respect;         (**)  A return to a reasonable degree of freedom  in  the movement of goods    and  services;         (iii)  A return to freedom in the foreign exchange markets and in the movement    of capital.    (c)   There  should be a  general understanding about measures  to  ensure a betterworking  of the gold standard in the future.  Success in  obtaining an understanding ofthis character will not only  be  a factor of potent influence on public opinion in many countries, but will also give the assurance to an  individual country that,  as long as itpursues a sound monetary and  economic policy, it will be in a position to acquire and maintain the necessary reserves.    (d)   International action, however indispensable, cannot restore a normal economicsituation unless the proper internal measures have been taken.  Each individual country must  therefore  be prepared to take the necessary steps to achieve internal equilibriumin the following matters:         (i)  Revenue and expenditure, not only of  the  State  budget proper, but also    of the budgets of public enterprises (railways, etc.)  and of local authorities, should    be balanced;         (ii)  It will be  necessary  to  create and maintain healthy conditions  in  the    internal money and capital market and at all costs to avoid an inflationary increase    of the note circulation in  order to  meet Government deficits;         (tit)  It is necessary to give that sufficient  degree of flexibility to the national    economy without which an international monetary standard, however improved,    cannot function  properly.    We  feel that, in practice,  certain countries  are in  a key  position in that  the re-establishment of a free gold standard by them would  influence action in a number of othercountries.    We  are well  aware of the difficulty, for countries no longer on the gold standard, of returning to that  standard at  an appropriate rate of exchange,  so long as uncertaintyprevails with regard to the course of gold prices. The experience of the last decade  hasshown that the restoration of the gold standard at too low a rate of exchange as well asat too high a rate presents grave disadvantages, not only from the national,  but afso fromthe international, point of view.  On the other hand, the very fact that exchanges continueto fluctuate is not without its effect on the level of gold prices and may hamper a monetary and economic policy designed to promote a recovery  of prices in gold countries.   In  the face of this diiemma it would appear necessary to consider what policy may best be pursued in the immediate future in order to bring about such a general recovery as would facilitate the re-establishment of the  international monetary  standard.                         -a.2. Currency Policy to be followed prior to such a General Restoration of the Gold Standard.     It will be useful to consider what specific measures must be taken in different groups of countries.
- i4 -        (a)  Countries  with  a free gold standard and with abundant monetary reserves:             (i)  To  pursue a liberal credit  policy, characterised by low money rates        in the short-term market and a reduction of long-term money rates by conversions        and other operations as far as feasible;             (ii)   As far as market conditions and  Central Bank  statutes permit, to        maintain an open market policy designed to provide a plentiful supply of credit;             (Hi)   To allow gold  to flow out freely;             (iv)    To permit the greatest freedom possible to outward capital movements        in older  to facilitate sound foreign investments.        (b)  Countries  which have left the gold standard:             (i)  Efforts should be made to avoid  a  competition  between States to        acquire  a temporary advantage in international  trade by depreciating  the        external value  of their currency below such a point as is required to re-establish        internal  equilibrium;             (ii)   Under present  conditions,  exchange rates  are liable to be constantly        disturbed by speculative  movements to the disadvantage of international trade.        In a period prior to the adoption of a new parity, it is advisable for the authorities        regulating the  currencies concerned to smooth out, so far as their resources        permit, day-to-day  fluctuations in the exchanges due  to  speculative influences        by buying and selling foreign currencies.   The success of such measures would        be enhanced by the co-operation of other markets.        (c)  Countries   which  have introduced  exchange  restrictions, whether they have    abandoned  the  gold  standard or not:             (i)  It is  desirable that these restrictions should be totally  abolished as        early as possible.  It is realised, however,  that this ultimate aim cannot in all        cases be immediately attained.  In such circumstances, the  restrictions applied        to foreign trade should be relaxed or abolished  in the first instance, even though        it may be necessary to maintain them for a time with regard to capital movements.        (This whole  question is referred to  more fully in Section III, i.)             (ii)   Such  relaxation may, in certain cases where  the external value of the        currency has  depreciated, necessitate  the abandonment  of existing  parities.        In a number of countries, exchange restrictions would  seem  to defeat their own        end;  for, whenever the official rate of exchange is maintained at a higher level        than the economic rate, a form of import premium is given to all importers  and        a form of export duty imposed on all exporters.   Experience seems  to have        proved that, when a careful policy of gradually relaxing restrictions is pursued,        internal confidence  in the currency can be maintained, although,  of course, in        such circumstances, the  necessity  of  effecting budgetary  equilibrium and of        resisting inflationary tendencies will  prove to be  of paramount importance.        In such  cases, it would seem particularly valuable to maintain close relationship        between  these  countries, the Financial Organisation  of the League  and  the        Bank for International Settlements, in order to devise and apply the appropriate        policy in each case.    In the case of certain countries which are heavily indebted abroad, more especially on short-term,  a  solution of the  debt problem is  necessary before  their Governments\
will  be in  a position to modify existing monetary  policy.   We deal with this questionlater.                        3. Functioning  of the Gold Standard.     It is important that any declarations in favour of the restoration of an internationalgold standard should, at the same time, indicate certain essential principles for its properfunctioning under modern conditions.     It is not our intention to suggest that anything  should be done which would in anyway limit the freedom of action and reduce the responsibility of Central Banks in deter-mining monetary policy.  The  following  statement is in  full agreement with the reportof the Gold Delegation, which  we endorse.  This report  has also been endorsed by theBoard of the Bank for International Settlements.  The Governments will no doubt findopportunity to consult  their  Central Banks on these questions before  taking their finaldecision at the Conference.(a)   Relation between Political  Authorities and Central Banks.    We would  suggest that the Conference  emphasise the importance of the monetaryorganisation being so arranged as to make  Central Banks independent of political influence.We feel it also  important to suggest that Governments in their economic and financial policy should avoid increasing the difficulties of Central Banks in the discharge of their responsibility.(b)   Monetary Reserves.    The modern tendency is to  concentrate  gold in Central Banks.  Before the war,more than 40 per cent of the total monetary gold stocks  consisted of gold in circulationor with private banks, while, at the present time, only  9 per cent represents gold notin the hands of Central  Banks.  This development is, in our opinion, to be welcomed, asit tends to enhance the power and the freedom of action of Central Banks.  Gold reserves are now primarily required to meet external demands  for payment  caused by somedisequilibrium on the foreign account.   At  the same  time  it must be recognised that present-day legislation  in  many countries  renders  much  gold unavailable for inter-national use.  We believe that  the following steps can be taken without  in any waydiminishing public confidence in order to permit more  effective use  of the reserves of central Banks:    (i)  Lowering of Cover Ratios.   Experience  during  the past few  years has clearlyshown that the cover provisions in the statutes of many Central Banks have not  been sufficiently elastic to permit the utilisation of  reserves for meeting foreign payments toan extent which would  be justified  in cases of emergency.    The increased volume of short-term funds capable of moving rapidly from  one country to another may represent an extra  burden on the balance of  payments.    Moreover, when the national economy has, for one reason or another, become lessflexible, it may take longer to restore a lost equilibrium and during the intervening perioda larger amount of gold may have to be exported.    We suggest that the  Conference should  stress the need  of  introducing greaterelasticity in the primary cover regulations of Central Banks, particularly so  as to makethe reserves more fully  available to  meet fluctuations  in the balance of payments.    A great advance would be  made if legal minimum requirements of gold (or of gold and foreign exchange) were substantially lowered below  the customary 33 or 40 ratio.The  margin available for payments abroad representing  the  difference between the
actual holdings and the legal minimum would then be considerably greater. However,the Conference should it is suggested emphasise strongly that a change in the minimumcover requirements must not be taken by countries with limited resources as an excuse for the building  up of a larger superstructure of  notes  and credits, for then  the  freemargin would be dissipated  and the purpose  of the reform the strengthening of theposition of the Central Bank concerned would not be  achieved.    (ii)  The  Gold Exchange Standard.    In  addition to those  countries which allowforeign exchange  to be included in their legal reserve requirements, Central Banks in nearly all countries supplement  their gold holdings with foreign short-term assets inorder to be able to influence the exchange more directly and more speedily than by goldexports. In some cases, Central Banks also employ those assets to influence their internalmoney  markets.    This system as practised  in  recent  years, particularly when it has involved themaintenance  of very considerable  exchange holdings, has not worked without revealingsome grave defects. The exceptional circumstances of these years undoubtedly contributed to an  undue accumulation of foreign balances in particular&apos; markets. We think that thesedefects may be overcome partly by the better working of the gold  standard itself andpartly by special improvements which would provide for a system more centralised andsubject to  more  effective control.  We are of the opinion that this system of holdingforeign exchange balances, if properly controlled, may for many countries hasten  their return to an international standard and will form an essential feature in the permanentfinancial arrangements of the countries which have no highly developed capital markets.It is very desirable that foreign exchange holdings in Central Banks should be  investedwith or through the Central Bank  of the currency concerned or with  the Bank for Inter-national Settlements.  This is  all the more important, because it is,  in our  opinion,imperative that Central Banks should have a  complete knowledge of all the operations of other Central  Banks on their markets.  Moreover,  it is important that each central bank which employs foreign exchange balances should take all  necessary measures inorder to secure  itself against the  risks of foreign investments.    (iii)  Other Methods of economising Gold.   In countries where bank-notes  of smalldenominations are in  circulation,  these small notes may be withdrawn and  replacedwithin proper limits by subsidiary coin, which will to some extent reduce the strain ongold reserves  through  the  decrease in note circulation.    It should further  be possible to improve  the mechanism of clearing in individual countries.  Payments of taxes and salaries,  large retail transactions, the transference ofmoney from place to place, may increasingly be effected by means of cheques, post-officepayments or other transfers, and  much could  be done by Governments and municipalauthorities, even  without legislation, to set an example by accepting cheques in payments for taxes, public utility services, etc.     (iv)  Distribution  of Monetary Reserves.    The present abnormal gold situation,with nearly 80 per cent of the world&apos;s monetary gold concentrated  in five countries,cannot be  explained by  any single factor, but should be regarded as a sign of certainprofound disequilibria which have influenced the numerous elements in the balance ofpayments.  When considering remedies, the multiplicity of the causes must be taken intoaccount.  To obtain a  more lasting improvement of present abnormal conditions it willbe necessary to allow  a freer movement of goods and to rely less upon gold shipmentsfor the settlement of foreign liabilities.    In previous sections of this document, we have suggested that  the minimum coverrequirements of Central Banks should be lowered and have also expressed the opinionthat some countries should allow holdings of foreign exchange to be included in the legalreserves.  The difficulties connected with the  uneven distribution of gold in the world
will to some extent be mitigated by these measures; but they are, of course, not in them-selves sufficient.    When countries with deficient reserves return to the gold standard, the new paritiesshould be such as to be  consistent with a favourable balance of payments and so attractan adequate reserve without  undue effort.    In some cases, an automatic adjustment of the situation will take place by a returnmovement of previously expatriated capital, which has been invested in countries with large monetary reserves.  It is important that public opinion  in  the latter  countries should realise that an outflow of gold under such circumstances does not in itself reveala disequilibrium in the balance of payments, but is rather a sign of a general revival ofconfidence.  To prevent  an outflow by credit restriction might not only retard the redistribution-tribution of gold, but might also have a deflationary  tendency.    The  question arises whether it would not be possible to anticipate, by internationalcredit operations, the process of building up adequate reserves in countries where thesereserves are now deficient.   Such operations might relieve the foreign  exchange markets of the prolonged strain  which would be inflicted on them by a continuous demand forgold by Centrat Banks desirous of strengthening their  reserves (see below under  III, 3).(c)  Co-operation of Central Banks in  Credit Policy.    The Conference will no doubt wish to emphasise the great importance to be attachedto the maintenance of close relationship between Central Banks which will permit themto take account of both nationai and international considerations  when framing theirpolicy.  While the responsibility of  each one of them for the  measures  taken on theirown markets must be feft unimpaired, continuous consultations between them should help to co-ordinate the  policy pursued in the various centres and may indeed enable the intervention of an individual Bank to become more effective if supported from abroad.    The  Bank for  International Settlements represents a new agency  for Central Baiiksand should be able  to play an increasingly important part, not only by improving contact,but also as an instrument for common action, of which severai indications can be foundin this document.    In this connection, we draw the attention to point 5 of the resolution which the Boardof the Bank for International Settlements, at its meeting on July nth, 1932, unanimouslyadopted.  The Board declared itself in substantial agreement with the  conclusions of thefinal report of the Gold Delegation of the League of Nations of June 1932. These conclu-sions were considered by the Board as forming a starting-point for the elaboration of monetary principles which may be given practical application in future.    We attach great importance to this declaration and to the pursuance of consuftationsamong Central Banks, particularly with a view to achieving the  object,  as stated in thereport  of the Gold Delegation, of checking undue fluctuations in the  purchasing powerof gold.  We are convinced, as were  the Gold Delegation, that action  must be based on international understanding and co-operation.  The  prospects of the general restorationof the gold standard and of its successful working in the future appear  to depend in large measure on progress in this fiefd.                                     4.  Silver.    After keeping relatively stable from 1921 to 1929, the price of siiver in gold currenciesfell abruptly by more than one-half in less than three years.  There is no doubt that  thissudden decline must, in the main, be attributed to the same causes as  have acted on thegeneral level of prices  and may thus be said to illustrate in a particular case the incidence of the world depression.  Some special factors can, however, be found which have accen-tuated the downward trend, and these were to some extent already operating before the
depression set in.  Such factors are:  the demonetisation of silver, the reduction of thesilver content of token coins, and also the disposal of surplus stocks.    We have considered a series of proposals which have been discussed in recent years with a view to raising the price of  silver, and we  wish, in this connection, to makethe following observations:    (i)   It has been suggested that some form of bimetallism should be introduced.    We would  point out  that  a bimetallic standard, which presupposes a fixed relation between the value of gold and  that of silver, could be safely introduced only if the mostimportant countries of the world agreed to such a measure.  As the only international monetary standard which is at present likely to command  universal acceptance is thegold standard,  the idea of introducing bimetallism must be regarded as impracticable.    (ii)   It has been proposed that Banks of Issue should be allowed to hold increasedquantities of silver in their legal reserves.    On the  assumption  that  no form  of bimetallism  will  prove acceptable, silver  isunsuitable for extensive inclusion in the metallic reserves of a Central Bank, there being no fixed price at which it would be received by other Central Banks in the settlement  ofbalances on the international  account.    (Hi)  It has also been suggested that Governmental action  should be taken for thepurpose of improving the price of silver.    We would, in this connection, refer to the suggestion made in a previous part of thisreport to  the effect that, in countries  where bank-notes of  small denominations are  in circulation, these small notes might be withdrawn and replaced  within proper limits bysubsidiary coins, and we think  that the  Conference should, in this connection, examine  towhat extent the use of silver in subsidiary coinage could be enlarged. Whatever sales  ofGovernment stocks of silver may be  deemed desirable, it is  important to conduct these in such a manner as to avoid any unnecessary disturbance of the market.    The Conference should also consider whether, and if so by what methods, the mar-keting of the metal by producers and currency authorities is susceptible of improvement.The question of developing new and enlarged industrial uses for silver is in our judgmentalso worthy  of careful consideration.    From the point of view of commercial relations with silver-using countries, particularlyChina, trade interests  would best be  served, not by a rise in the price of silver as such,but by a rise in the general level of commodity prices. Any action which would tend  toraise that level and in due course achieve its stabilisation may be  expected to have afavourable effect on the price  of silver  and would, on general grounds, be welcome.                                    II.  PRICES.                     I.  Disequilibrium between Prices and Costs.    The decline in prices of recent years has created a series of difficulties which must,by one method or another, be oveixome in  order to make progress in the monetary andeconomic field possible.    In the first place, the burden of debts has  increased considerably in terms of realwealth and made it more and more difficult  for debtors  to discharge their obligations and avoid a breach of contract. With regard to international debts, a special transfer problemarises, with possible dangerous repercussions on  the whole monetary structure.    Secondly, as a rule, costs fall more slowly than prices, which tends to make enterprisesunremunerative, with a  consequent disorganisation   and reduction of production asevidenced by an increase of unemployment. Even if unemployment benefits are granted,
the reduction in earnings will, in its turn, diminish the purchasing power in the handsof the public. Moreover, a restriction of sales will make further sound extension or eventhe vipkeep of industrial plant seem unnecessary and arrest activity with regard to newinvestments, causing, not only particularly serious unemployment for workers engagedin producing capital goods, but also a tendency for savings to remain idle.    Thirdly, the decline  in prices has not proceeded at  the same pace for all classes of commodities. Manufactured articles tend, for many reasons, to fall more slowly in pricethan natural products, and it is a well-known fact that retail prices are more resistant thanwholesale. A special feature of the present depression is the tendency revealed in a numberof countries for prices of  certain classes of goods required for capital equipment to resista fall, such as would have facilitated readjustments. This tendency has retarded recoveryand has rendered new capital enterprise unattractive, however low short- and long-termrates of interest may be.  In some cases,  the cause of this relative rigidity in the pricesof investment goods would seem to be that they have, on the whole, been  more controlled by cartels and  other monopolistic combines than other goods.    The decline in production, superimposed  on the decline in prices, has reduced thenational money incomes  of  some  of  the largest  countries in  the world to less than60 per cent of what they were three years ago.  In countries which depend for their exporton primary products, the gold prices of these products have in many cases fallen to a third,a quarter, or even less, of the former price. Depreciation of their currencies may to someextent have alleviated their internal difficulties,  but  the precipitous decline in world prices has had its disastrous effects on the foreign position of these countries, particularly by so substantially increasing the burden of  their  external liabilities.    Furthermore,  difficult budgetary problems of great concern to Governments have arisen in particular, as  grants for unemployment benefit and other social purposes areadded to the expenditure.  When the revenue  of States and local authorities  must beraised from a shrinking  national income, rates of taxation will, after a certain  point,become  so high that they cannot but exert a serious depressing influence on trade andindustry.                       2.  Methods of  restoring  Equilibrium.    (a)   Obviously, one method of restoring a lost equilibrium between costs and price is to reduce costs.   As  a  rule, this will not be possible without reducing money rates ofwages.  Some considerable reductions of this kind  have recently been effected, in certain countries to the extent of something  like  20  to  25 per cent.   It is found,  however,that possibilities for effecting such reductions  differ from one country to another, andthat each further substantial reduction meets with  increased resistance.    It is an open question, difficult to answer a priori, to what extent these reductionswill correct former maladjustments between  different  categories  of wages and  prices(particularly in  different stages of the process of production) and in that way bring abouta better relative position.  The burden of debts will, however, if left undiminished, createmany difficult problems.    (b)   Equilibrium may also be restored by  a  rise in prices.    (i)   One method of  raising prices  is to limit  supply.  Reference  is made to thissubject  in Section VI of these  Annotations.    (M)  In countries  with  a free gold standard  and with large monetary  reserves,  itwould seem possible (as  indicated in Section  I, 2 (a)) to pursue a liberal credit policy,including low short-term interest rates and in  some cases also open market operations.Moreover, there should be, as far as feasible, a  reduction of long-term interest  rates bymeans of conversions and other operations. It is pertinent to observe that the open marketoperations  which were undertaken by the Federal Reserve Banks  of the United  States
of America in the spring of 1932, in conjunction with the measures  taken through theReconstruction Finance Corporation, arrested the contraction of credits and the hoardingof currency; they also created excess reserves  for private banks to an  amount of morethan S500 million, which helped to restore confidence in the banking structure.     Some Central Banks, by  means of the leadership they exercise on their markets,have been able to induce savings banks and similar institutions to adjust deposit ratesand at the same time bring down rates for mortgage loans and other long-term obligations.     (***)  In order that a liberal credit policy  may have the desired effect on prices, itis necessary that  a demand  for credit should arise.     In the first place, there is some reason to  expect a spontaneous  demand  for goods.For  example, during the depression, many industrial firms not only abstained fromenlarging their plant but also postponed  repairs. But this delay cannot go on indefinitely,and  it is probable that, in this field, a considerable potential demand has accumulated.Many firms have  in past years made financial provisions  for this purpose on their depre-ciation account.  Even consumers may be in a somewhat similar position as regards moredurable articles, such as clothes, furniture, motor-cars, etc.     The suggestion is often made that Governments and other authorities should activelyincrease the purchasing power in the hands of the public  by extensive schemes for public expenditure, financed by borrowings from the  market.   If such a policy were net  kept within reasonable limits,  and if  it were to result in deteriorating Government  credit,debt conversions  might be interfered with and the lowering of long-term interest ratesdelayed.     It is very much as an outcome of increasing confidence in  the general financial andeconomic structure that we  expect an increase in effective demand.   If it is found that political and monetary authorities are endeavouring to carry out a policy which holdsout some hope of ultimate improvement, we believe that the public will soon respond byresuming normal economic developments. We venture to suggest that a  general adoptionof the policy outlined in this report aiming at the restoration of currencies on a healthybasis, financial reconstruction, a greater freedom in the movement  of  goods  and some immediate measures to give evidence of its practical  application would be  a decisivestep towards this revival of confidence.     (iv)  Finally, a few words suffice to point out that a recovery of sound internationallending, which would put purchasing power into the hands  of countries with a limitedsupply of domestic capital, would have  a helpful effect on prices.                 III.  RESUMPTION OF THE MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL.    A return to a normal situation will be dependent, inter alia, on a resumption of inter-national capital movements. It is essential that the obstacles which at the present momentprevent such a resumption be cleared away so that, when confidence returns, capitalcan move freely. Apart from the instability of exchanges, which we have dealt with above,some  of the major obstacles to capital movements  are^the control of foreign exchanges and, in  certain cases, the existing burden of debts.                  1.  Abolition of Foreign Exchange Restrictions.    The adverse balance of accounts in many countries, aggravated by the drop in prices and the falling-off in foreign trade, has obliged those countries, when they could no longerre-establish equilibrium by means of foreign credits, to choose between abandoning the stability of their currency or  instituting exchange  restrictions as  an artificial means of
balancing imports and exports of foreign currency. Certain countries have even adoptedboth systems simultaneously.  The majority of the countries which have recently sufferedthe disastrous consequences of unrestricted inflation have opted for exchange restrictions and have thus maintained the nominal parity of their currency. Such control has enabledthem more or less successfully to prevent  or limit  exports of national capital and thewithdrawal of foreign credits/&apos; but this result has been obtained only by closing the doorto new investments.-^Further,&quot;foreign exchange restrictions have frequently been adoptedin order to improve&apos; the balance of payments by refusing to pay in  foreign currency for those imports which do not appear indispensable. But, in the long run, this reduction hasnot had the expected effect of improving the trade balance, since the exports from  each country encounter similar monetary restrictions abroad or administrative barriers hastilyerected as a measure of defence.    Thus, exchange restrictions, and clearing agreements which  often follow, constitute an almost insurmountable obstacle  to the circulation of capital, and represent one of themain causes of the falling-off in international trade, A return to normal conditions pre-supposcs their disappearance, which is itself conditional, in each of the countries concerned,on the permanent restoration of equilibrium in  the balance of payments.    In order to provide for  the restoration of equilibrium in  the balance of payments and to ensure permanence by strengthening the metal reserve  of certain banks of  issue,various  measures  are essential which have been  mentioned above.   It may  be useful to stress the fact that it is not necessary in all cases to wait for the Governments to meetbefore taking these measures. On the contrary, it is essential  that, in every country,efforts should be made without delay with a view to the restoration of a normal situation.                             2.   Existing Indebtedness.    It may  happen that, when  all  the  above-mentioned measures have been taken,permanent equilibrium in the balance of payments cannot be restored owing to the threat of mass withdrawals of short-term deposits or owing to the heavy charge resulting fromthe service of long-term debts.  In that event, arrangements relating to  foreign debts willhave to be made between the parties concerned.S5[: We desire at this point to stress the fact that it is essential that the policy followedby the creditor countries should finally place the debtor countries in a position to pay offtheir obligations in the form of goods and services.F:--  We  also venture to  state that  the restoration of  a normal situation must be accompanied by a return  of  confidence, and that, in this connection, respect for under-takings entered into is an essential  factor.   Only when, as  a result of unforeseen circum-stances, it has become impossible for contracts to be carried out in  their entirety&apos; can an adjustment of obligations  to  the possibilities  of the situation be effected between theparties concerned in the interests of creditors and debtors alike.(i)  Short-term Debts.    The present regulation  of the short-term debts of various countries  by means ofstandstill agreements, exchange restrictions and transfer moratoria  is in its very natureonly a temporary measure.  If appfied for any length of time, such measures tend to prolongthe crisis and to increase  its intensity by delaying the moment  when the situation  wiflappear in its true light. That is why the existing system, which presents the danger of placing good and bad debtors on a footing of equality and thus tends to destroy the credit of the good debtors, should be brought to an end as soon as possible and be replaced by a definitive  solution which would^ take into  account the circumstances of each individual case.  It is  essential  that this ^readjustment should have the  effect  of liberating. real
commercial acceptances as soon as possible from any form of regulation. Trade could thusrevive by utilising its normal channels.  The banks of issue in every country should support such a measure of restoration by every means in their power.    The settlement of this  question is  essentially the concern of the creditors and thedebtors themselves.  It is nevertheless important for Governments that a solution shouldbe found for this problem, which undoubtedly affects both the monetary and the commercial policy of the  country.  The object of the suppression  of exchange restrictions can beachieved only when the  dangers to currency  arising from the problem of transfers arebanished and confidence is restored.(ii)  Long-term Debts.    In  the case of those long-term debts, the burden of which has been so aggravated by the present level of prices  as to be incompatible with the equilibrium of the balanceof payments,  agreements should be concluded  between debtors and the bondholders.Nevertheless,  it is essential for this problem, as for the problem  of short-term debts,that a  satisfactory solution should be  reached  if the  equilibrium of the balance  ofpayments is  to be secured and normal conditions restored.    Such a solution must be sought between the interested parties working  together.In certain cases,  bondholders have already formed associations;  in others, it  might be useful for such groups to be formed.  Moreover, the associations of  different  countries should keep in touch with each other.   The issue houses should be  in a position to lendtheir  good  offices in this  connection to  the bondholders.    In  order  to  facilitate,  where necessary,  direct agreements between debtors andcreditors, a list of persons of recognised standing and  competence might be drawn upwhose mediation would  be open  to  the parties concerned.    We should like to point out that, in this sphere also, there  is no uniform solution for all cases.                               3.  Capital Movements.    The resumption of the movement of capital throughout the world in other words,the re-establishment of international financing should be effected through the normalcredit channels.   The creation of a special credit institution may be expected to promotethis resumption.  There is no doubt that, as soon as the world situation again becomesnormal, credit will begin to operate as in the past.  It will be asked for, granted or refusedby the  usual  means.  It should be noted  that available credit has not disappeared.On the  contrary,  there is an abundant supply, but, for the reasons mentioned above, it isnot being used.   In view of past experience  it  would, however, be desirable to encourage the exchange of  information  as to  the volume and movement of short-term credits.    At the same time, the resumption of lending may  prove to be slow if no organisedinternational action is taken to stimulate it.   A number of projects have been  discussed on various occasions.    Among the suggestions brought  to the Committee&apos;s notice is the establishment of aMonetary Normalisation Fund, which was contemplated at  the Stresa Conference.    It might, in fact, happen that,  after all  the&apos;foregoing recommendations had been applied, the responsible public authorities might  still  be  reluctant to re-establish the free-dom  of exchange transactions,  in which case even a  moderate amount  of assistancefrom  outside might help to restore their confidence and that  of the public as well.    In view of the fact that the object of the establishment of such a fund is to  facilitatemonetary normalisation,  the Bank for International Settlements would appear  to be themost  appropriate body to administer this fund, since  it is desirable to  avoid any political influence in its administration.
    This idea of  special assistance proving necessary to restart the financial machine,which has been at a standstill for so long, has been further developed in the course of our deliberations.  The suggestion has been made that help might be given by means of theestablishment  of an International  Credit Institute, which would derive its funds either from the Banks of Issue or from private sources,  the support of the Governments being provided in both cases, as would also be necessary in the case of the Monetary NormalisationFund.    Obviously, an institution of this kind the object of which would be to set in motioncapital which is at present lying idle should grant new credits only under sound condi-tions and subject to strict supervision with a view to preventing any inflation.  It shouldnot refund the old credits (&quot; frozen &quot; credits) referred to above.  It is also obvious thatthis institute should be free from any political influence, and it might be affiliated to oradministered by the Bank for International Settlements.  If this idea meets with theapproval of the Governments, we suggest that the question should be gone into more fully.    As another method  of encouraging capital movements, a programme of public workson an international scale has  been  submitted to the Commission.   We feel that it is notprobable that  public works can be internationally financed in the immediate future toany considerable extent.  The last year has brought out to an unprecedented degree the dangers of over-borrowing and the exchange difficulties which may arise in connectionwith effecting the service of foreign loans.   Quite apart from this. Governments  are nowreceiving so many demands which  they have to refuse, and, moreover, have to  retrenchin so many directions, that they must consider  carefully  before embarking upon newbudgetary  commitments of this nature.    We recognise, however, that,  should any Government in a lending country desireto promote the chances  of obtaining capital for this purpose by  giving some form of guarantee,  it is obvious that  the commencement  of the works that have been proposed would be expedited thereby,  at a  moment when  even the  best projects  find it difficultto receive the  requisite funds. It goes without saying, especially in existing conditions,that sound financial principles demand that only such public works  should  be  financedas afford adequate assurance  of being  productive of the domestic  and foreign currencynecessary for the  service of the capital charges.                  IV.   RESTRICTIONS  ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE.    Restrictions on international trade, whether they take the form of  prohibitions orof quotas or licences,  have in recent years become exceptionally widespread and are sonumerous that  they now constitute an almost insurmountable barrier  to internationalexchanges.  They have brought about an unprecedented reduction in international tradeand threaten it with  complete paralysis.    By their severe and often arbitrary character, by the rigid control which they exerciseover commercial transactions, and by the uncertainty and instability which they introduce into international economic relations, these restrictive measures often assume the aspect of actual weapons of economic warfare, although they are usually represented as instru-ments for defending and  protecting internal markets.    The  extension of this system of restrictions tends to nullify the advantages resultingfrom commercial  treaties by making their provisions ineffective as regards commodities to which the restrictions are applied.    The  abolition of these measures, which have grown up  around and in addition toCustoms  tariffs, constitutes the most urgent problem from the point of view of bringingworld economy back to a more normal condition or, at any rate, of reverting to the situation
which obtained a few years ago when commercial transactions were influenced, practicallyspeaking, only by Customs duties.                           i.  Economic Causes and Effects.     The gravity of  the circumstances and exceptional exigencies  which have led to thedevelopment of these restrictive measures has to be recognised.  Without going into theconditions peculiar to each country and to the various products which would carry ustoo  far we may nevertheless summarise as follows  the causes  which have led to theadoption  of these measures.     In  the first place, a number of States have been led to adopt them by financial and monetary  considerations.   They regarded these restrictions as  a  means  immediately available  for  preventing their currency  from depreciating  owing to  the effects of thedepression on their balances of payments.  This  was so, in particular, in the case ofheavily indebted States.  The virtual stoppage of the international movement of capital and the considerable reduction in invisible exports forced those countries to  restrict their imports as an artificial means of improving their balance of trade, even at the cost  of amarked slowing down of their economic activities.     &apos;     Moreover, the fall in the prices of certain essential agricultural  products  (cereals,live-stock, etc.)  has borne most heavily on countries which can  pay for their imports and fulfil their  foreign financial obligations only by  the export of such products; butit  has also had  repercussions on the policy of countries  which, while not exporters, arenone the  less producers of these commodities.     The former countries,  seeing  their external trade  balance rapidly declining,  haveresorted to restrictions affecting more especially their imports of manufactured products,with the object  of improving their balances of payments. The latter countries, in orderto prevent home prices  from being involved in the fall  of world prices, have resorted,in their turn,  to restrictive measures prohibiting or rationing the importation of agricul-tural products.     Certain restrictions  have also been imposed, especially on raw materials, either inthe  absence of  agreements between producers, or to promote the conclusion of  such agreements or to render their operation possible.     Similar restrictions have been applied to manufactured goods. One of the principalgeneral  causes, however, is the constantly increasing tendency to restrict foreign markets,and the influx into countries with relatively high prices and a stable currency of manufac-tured goods originating  in countries with a depreciated  currency, or in countries which apply measures  to stimulate their exports.     The obstacles placed in the way of imports in various countries have had the inevitable result of  diverting goods from  their customary markets to  those countries which  still remained  open to them,  with adverse effects upon the latter.     Various countries, although resolutely opposed in principle to the policy of restrictions,have been compelled to  retaliate  against measures directed against their  own exportsby adopting similar measures themselves, particularly when they have seen the systemof prohibitions,  once it has been established, employed as a means of bargaining for thereduction  of tariffs.     The foregoing summary is not intended in any way  to justify the restrictions; none the less, it seems desirable to indicate the causes which have led to their adoption, sincethe most effective way of endeavouring to bring about the removal of these grave obstacles to trade will be to attack their causes.     It should be remarked  that the  restrictions have  only been temporarily effective;subsequently they have had harmful consequences, since the restriction of imports hasresulted in decreases, sometimes much  greater, in exports. Thus,  these measures, which
were adopted by the various countries in order to reduce the effects of the crisis, have, onthe contrary, made the position worse, and contributed dangerously to prolong existingdifficulties.  It is true that a  better equilibrium of prices might facilitate  the abolitionof restrictions, but at the same time it  must  be  recognised  that these restrictions in themselves considerably reduce  the  effect of the economic forces  which might bringabout an increase  in prices and their stabilisation.                 2.  Exchange Restrictions, Clearing Agreements,  etc.    During the last few years, the situation has been aggravated  by the existence, side by side with the system  of  trade restrictions,  of various measures of foreign exchange control.    These  measures fall essentially within the monetary and  financial sphere. 1  But in practically all cases they constitute one of the most serious impediments to the exchangeof goods, by restricting international payments.    Exchange  restrictions  have also led to the adoption of a large number of clearing,compensation and barter  agreements, and  the like.  The object of such agreementsoriginally was to enable trade to continue in spite of the restrictions in force;  but theyhave since  been given a wider application. Sometimes they operate so as to divert tradeinto artificial channels, to give artificial advantages to producers in the countries employingthem, and  to involve discrimination in the discharge of accumulated and  current debtsas between the creditors of different nationalities.    These clearing and compensation agreements have a particularly disruptive influenceowing to their tendency to give a purely  bilateral character to international commercial and financial relations, and they should be promptly abandoned if normal conditions areto be restored.                              3.  Indirect  Protectionism.    In addition to the  restrictions on international trade mentioned above, there arecertain provisions  which, while they have other objects in view, may constitute impedi-ments to imports.  Measures relating to the obligation to affix marks of origin to imported goods,  restrictions in  the  veterinary  and phytopathological  sphere and  other  similar measures  coming  within the  category of indirect protectionism sometimes have  this character.    The Conference should make arrangements for dealing with these various questions in such a way as to secure equitable solutions as speedily as possible.                        4.  Possibility of  A bolition of Restrictions.     International trade will  not fully revive  until these  new impediments have been removed and it can again  flow in its natural channels.     We do not underestimate the difficulties in the way of the rapid  and total abolitionof restrictions.    We are aware that although in a different economic situation attempts have beenmade for several years past, particularly under the auspices of the League  of Nations, to abolish import and export  prohibitions and restrictions by means of multilateral conven-tions.     A Convention was signed on November 8th, 1927, after lengthy and careful  prepar-ations.   The  Convention,  while allowing temporary exceptions, was designed to bringabout  this general abolition.   But it has remained ineffective, owing  partly  to theseSec Section III, 1: Abolition of Foreign Exchange Restrictions.
exceptions and partly to special circumstances which resulted from the relations between certain countries whose accession was necessary.  Moreover, the  &quot; catastrophe &quot; clause(relating to the safeguarding of vital interests), which is included in this Convention andin several commercial treaties, has often been interpreted  in such a  way as to permit of any kind of restriction.  Consequently, if it cannot be eliminated, it should be confined to well-defined  and strictly limited cases.     The  recollection of  the  difficulties previously encountered  is not  perhaps  veryencouraging, especially at the  present time when the situation  has become much graverand more complex. But a few observations may be made  on  this subject:     (a)  In the first place, it is  precisely because the position is becoming intolerablethat an effort to remedy it appears to be really necessary  and urgent.  At  the presenttime, the restrictions affect almost the  whole of international  trade and are profoundlydisturbing the reduced flow of trade which still continues.     (b)  Secondly, it should be noted that the 1927 Convention dealt with the problemof restrictions and prohibitions as an isolated problem, and did not concern itself withmeasures to modify the economic circumstances which were  the direct or indirect causes.     On the other hand,  if systematic action comprising economic as well as financialand monetary measures (including the settlement of inter-Governmental and other externaldebts, improvement of the  financial situation of the various countries, monetary stabilisation-sation, a better equilibrium of prices, etc.) could be undertaken, a return to  a normalstate of affairs and the disappearance of the various forms of restrictions to international trade could be looked for.  Such  action does not preclude the  possibility of recourse totraditional measures, such as the enlargement of quotas, whether unilaterally or bilaterally,so as to bring them closer to the normal level of trade exchanges, as well as tariff adjust-ments and agreements  for  the organisation of production,  if this appears necessary incertain cases with a view to the gradual elimination of all commercial restrictions.                                          *                                      *      *    We are therefore unanimous  in  affirming the necessity  that action for the removalof the restrictions on international trade (prohibitions, quotas, exchange restrictions, etc.)should be taken as soon as possible and continued on progressively wider lines as the other causes of the  present economic disorganisation are mitigated or removed.    The fact must  not be overlooked that the abolition of  restrictions will,  in its turn,exercise a very considerable influence on the situation and will effectively help to remove the other difficulties. If they can increase their exports, many  countries will be enabled to purchase larger quantities of foreign products.  The opening up of larger  markets,apart from whatever action may be required in the financial  sphere, will greatly  ease the difficulties encountered by the debtor countries as regards their balance of payments.                          V.   TARIFF AND TREATY POLICY.    The tariff policy which has been followed  by many countries in the past  has been greatly aggravated in recent years. This tendency has contributed largely to the disorgan-isation of world conditions. In respect of tariff  policy and treaty policy, as in the case of import restrictions, the Conference must seek to modify existing practices and to securethe adoption of more liberal methods.    Positive action in this direction is assured of important support. Countries compelledto dispose of a large proportion of  their products, whether agricultural or industrial,on the world markets are most deeply interested in checking the increase of tariff barriers
and in securing their reduction. An improvement in the world economic situation wouldbe facilitated if the debtor countries were enabled to pay their debts by the export ofgoods and services, and if the creditor countries framed their economic policy in such a way as to  maintain the capacity of debtor countries to pay by these means.  These creditorcountries can expect to collect interest and principal only if they so adjust their financialand commercial policies as to make payment by the debtors possible.    Doubtless there will be reluctance on the part of some countries to lower existingCustoms barriers owing to the uncertainty of present industrial conditions, the difficulty ofmaking foreign payments, and the possibility of such excessive importations as to imperil the existing internal order. Any lowering of tariffs must doubtless be effected in successivestages, and should, so far as possible, be simultaneous: no country can afford to adopt ormaintain a really liberal tariff policy if  other countries persist in  the opposite  policy.But a general lowering of the existing barriers to trade by all countries is unmistakablydesirable if conditions of world prosperity are to be restored.    Tariff policy can  obviously not be dealt with in isolation.  An  effective and  lastingreturn to greater freedom of trade cannot be looked for unless it is  accompanied by ageneral and durable improvement in financial and monetary  conditions, any more thana permanent  improvement of the financial and monetary situation can be looked for solong as international trade is not freed from its chief obstacles.                                        A.                                   Tariff policy.    The object of the Conference, as far  as tariff policy is concerned, must therefore beto reach a general agreement for the reduction of tariffs and to maintain more moderatetariff  policy in the future.                          i.  Cessation  of Tariff Increases.    As a first effort in this direction,  we suggest that a  &quot; Customs  truce &quot; might be concluded as a preliminary measure, pending the signature of agreements for the reductionof tariffs and other obstacles to  trade.  Such a truce, if it could be  secured and madegenerally effective, might have considerable value; but, in order to succeed, the proposalmust be presented under conditions favourable for immediate action.    Two methods have been put forward for checking the increase in Customs tariffs:    [a)  A Customs  truce, strictly so-called,  as proposed in 1929  by the EconomicCommittee of the League of  Nations (document C.531.M.185.1929.II) and as embodiedalso in Article 1 of the International Convention for the Lowering of Economic Barriers,dated June 18th, 1932, concluded between Belgium,  Luxemburg and the Netherlands.By this Convention, known as the Convention of Ouchy, the three countries mentionedundertake, as from the date of the signature of the Convention, not to increase Customstariffs and not to introduce new protective duties either between themselves or againstother  countries with whom they have commercial treaties.    [b)  A more elastic system is that on which the Geneva Commercial Agreement ofMarch 24th,  1930  (document C.203.M.96.1930.II), and  the Oslo Agreement, concludedbetween Belgium, the  Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries, are  based.   Withcertain  exceptions,  these two agreements do not prohibit tariff increases, but  merelygive each of the contracting parties the right to denounce the agreement, if, in spite of itsrepresentations, another contracting party introduces tariff increases which are prejudicial to the former.               *    It is obvious that, if the truce could be concluded with sufficient rapidity in itsabsolute form, it would  be the most effective means of preventing future  increases in tariffs.  But it must be pointed out that any truce would be more harmful than useful if it
resulted in a stabilisation of duties at the present level or in crystallising existing situations,however anomalous, and if it was not followed by a reduction of excessive tariffs.    In any case, the proposed agreement regarding the cessation of Customs tariff increases would certainly be ineffective if it were confined to the domain of Customs policy properand if the aggravation of other obstacles to international trade were not stopped, with aview to their being ultimately abolished; at the same  time, an undertaking not to createfresh obstacles would  be necessary.                              2.  Reduction of Tariffs.    To bring about a general reduction of tariffs, two ways are open, the advantages anddrawbacks of which have been exhaustively studied by the Economic Committee of theLeague of Nations the system of reduction by percentages, and the system of reduction to a uniform fevek    We are of opinion that the Conference should consider combining these two methods;but it must be clearly realised than an attempt to secure a general reduction of tariffs by a uniform mechanical formula may present considerable difficufties.  The Ouchy Agreement,however, forms a precedent in  this connection, in the sense that it provides for a systemof percentage reduction, it being understood that the reduction is only obligatory downto a certain level.  It should be observed that this method, while it represents an effort to reduce the level of tariffs, does not eliminate the existing differences between the tariff-levels of the different countries.                      3.   Special Aspects of the Tariff Problem.(a)   Agricultural Production.     In studying means for preventing the increase, or for effecting a reduction of tariffsin the future, it may be necessary to give special consideration to the question of  agri-cultural products.  Some members emphasised that this question affects the economicand social situation of certain countries and raises difficufties of a complicated character.Others maintained that the extreme agrarian protection practised by certain importantconsuming countries has been an important factor in depressing the world prices of stapleagricultural products, thus causing serious reductions of the purchasing power of theproducing countries, both in Europe and overseas, and gravely reducing their capacity to absorb the products of the industrial countries.(b)   Specific Duties.     It will also be desirable to consider whether and within what limits it will be possibleto revise specific duties fixed when prices were appreciably higher, so as to take accountof the fall which has taken place in commodity prices, whether on the national or the world market.(c)   Exceptions.     It will also be desirable, in connection with any multilateral agreement for the reduc-tion  or stabilisation of tariffs, to consider whether certain exceptions should be granted as, for example, in the case of fiscal (revenue) duties.
(d)   Supplementary Duties and Charges.    Attention has been drawn to the fact that, in certain cases, surtaxes or charges ofan administrative, statistical or other nature are levied  on imported goods, and  thatsometimes such duties amount to an appreciable increase of the Customs duties.  It hasbeen suggested that such duties should be taken into account in any measures intendedto effect a reduction or stabilisation of Customs duties.(e)  Unified Customs Nomenclature.    No doubt if it were found possible to put a uniform Customs nomenclature (a draftof which has already been prepared by the Sub-Committee of Experts under the auspices of the Economic Committee of the League and is being submitted to the Governments)rapidly into force, this would lessen some of the material difficulties of international actionin the matter of tariffs, and the Conference might accordingly draw the attention of states to the work proceeding in this field, expressing the hope that they will give it their favour-able attention, following as far as possible the procedure laid down by the Council of theLeague.  Evidently, however, tariff  reductions should not be  postponed pending  theadoption of a uniform nomenclature,  which at best will probably be a lengthy process.                             4.  Method of Procedure.    Reductions of tariffs may be effected:        (a)  By a general agreement  of the Conference;        [b)  By a collective agreement of a group of Governments;        (c)   By bilateral negotiations;        (d)  By autonomous action on the part of Governments individually.    The objects which States should have in view are, as has been indicated, the reductionof their Customs tariffs and the adoption of a more moderate policy.  These objects can,of course, be attained, up to  a point, independently or by bilateral negotiations; but,without disparaging the value of action on these lines, no serious progress along this roadcan be  anticipated under present conditions,  unless the different  countries have  the assurance that they  are proceeding pari passu with the majority at least of the  othercountries of substantial economic importance.   To give them this assurance, one or moreinternational agreements would seem  necessary.    The object at which the International Conference should aim is obviously  the conclu-sion of an agreement on as wide and comprehensive a scale as possible.   The ideal wouldbe an agreement to which all the  States would be parties.    If,  however,  a  universal agreement  is impracticable, there remains the possibilityof collective agreements concluded between particular States, open to the adhesion of allthe others.   Such agreements  might either determine the reduction of duties on definedlines, or lay down in a general manner the principles to be  followed in  reducing duties,leaving the application of these principles to bilateral negotiations.    The conclusion of collective  agreements raises the question of the rights of third parties; this question is discussed in  the next section.    We agree in pointing out that  the question of procedure  is not of capital importance.The important point is for all countries to unite their  efforts with a view to reducingtariff barriers and other obstacles to  trade on  as wide a basis as possible.
B.                            Most-Favoured-Nation Clause.     We consider that, in normal conditions, the unconditional and unrestricted most-favoured-nation clause should form the basis of commercial relations between nations.Accordingly, we recommend that the Conference should reach an agreement at any rate as to the scope of the most-favoured-nation clause, if not as to its precise form. In thisconnection, reference should be made to the reports drawn up in 1929 and 1931 by theEconomic  Committee regarding this clause.     It will be desirable at the same time to reach an agreement in regard to the moreimportant  questions connected with the application of this clause, such as Customs quotas,the excessive specialisation of tariffs, dumping and anti-dumping measures, the nationality of goods, &quot;  like &quot; products, and, until such time as all restrictions on currency are abolished,exchange restrictions and compensation and clearing agreements.     It  will also be desirable  in  this connection to reach an agreement regarding the exceptions  to the clause which may be deemed necessary.  A distinction must be drawn between permanent and  temporary exceptions.(a)   Permanent Exceptions.     Certain permanent exceptions to the clause are already usual in treaties of commerce frontier traffic,  Customs unions, etc.).   Careful  attention should,  however, be paid tothe question whether other permanent exceptions should be admitted, particularly asregards rights derived  from collective agreements.     A suggestion  which has been  strongly pressed in various quarters  is that states should  admit an  exception to  the most-favoured-nation  clause  whereby advantagesderived from plurilateral agreements should be limited to the contracting States and tosuch States as may voluntarily grant equivalent advantages.  This proposal  (which hasalready been adopted  in  certain bilateral treaties)  should certainly be most  carefullystudied. It has been argued, in support of this proposal, that, in the absence of an exceptionof this kind, the conclusion of collective conventions would encounter insuperable diffi-culties, since the application of the clause would, in such circumstances, place a premiumon abstention.  On the other hand, it has to be borne in mind that the circumstances ofvarious countries differ considerably, so  that in many cases they could not adhere to aplurilateral agreement when they are unaware of the concrete cases to which its provisionsmight later be applied and of the possible consequences which its application might involve for themselves.  Moreover,  there would be a danger of provoking the formationof mutually  opposed groups of countries, thus aggravating the very evils which it is sought to mitigate.  Finally, it has been emphasised that care must be taken to avoid prejudicing the rights of third parties.     In  any case, these exceptions must be subject to the conditions that agreements of this kind be open to the adhesion of all interested States and that their aim should bein harmony with the general interest. Amongst  the conditions that might be considered for this purpose, mention may be made of a proviso that these agreements shall have been concluded under the auspices of the League of Nations or of organisations dependent onthe League.  Further, these agreements must not involve new hindrances to international trade vis-a-vis countries having most-favoured-nation rights.  Finally, &quot; collective agree-ments &quot; can only be regarded  as  such when they comply with certain conditions, to bedetermined, as to  the number of the participating States.\
    The Conference should endeavour to find a solution for the whole of this questionwhich will reconcile the interests of all.(b)  Temporary Exceptions.    The Conference should also consider  whether, in  present circumstances, too rigidan insistence on most-favoured-nation rights may not involve a risk, in certain cases, of creating difficulties in the path of economic progress which might be overcome by admittingtemporary exceptions.    We feel, however,  that in this matter the greatest prudence is necessary and thatit would be difficult and  dangerous to draw  any general conclusions.   Each separatecase should receive careful attention and any discrimination against third States shouldbe avoided.    In this connection, attention should be drawn to the  special agreements concluded by the Danubian countries with certain purchasing countries, granting particular advan-tages in respect of a limited quantity of cereals. Most of the members of the Commissionheld that, without prejudice to the rehabilitation of the wheat market by means of widerarrangements, the  Conference should examine the possibility of admitting a  temporaryexception to the most-favoured-nation clause which  would allow the putting into forceof the above-mentioned agreements and would  give effect to the recommendations ofthe  Stresa Conference, without harming the interests of other countries.    Nevertheless, certain  members believe that any preferential measure analogous tothat mentioned above would be  prejudicial  to  the other cereal-producing countries.In all these  countries, the agricultural situation is very serious.  It is conceivable that special measures might be adopted in favour of some of these, provided such measuresdid  not injure the interests  of  the others.   That,  however, would not seem possible.Having  regard to the capacity to absorb cereals of the countries which do not produceenough  for  themselves, any improvement obtained by  preferential  methods  in the quantities purchased from certain countries whether  directly  or  indirectly, owing tothe  latter being enabled to offer the product at relatively lower prices, would diminishto an equivalent extent purchases in the other producing countries at a  time when theworld market has  undergone considerable shrinkage.   In  conclusion,  these membersconsider that  any exception  to the most-favoured-nation clause,  however temporary,is a bad precedent  which  should not be encouraged.    Without wishing to contest the validity of these arguments, other members maintain that it is less a question of increasing the quantities of cereals bought in the Danubiancountries than of bringing prices  up to a reasonable  level.  Moreover, the quantitiesthus revalorised would only represent a very small percentage  of the consumption ofthe  importing countries.                 VI.  ORGANISATION  OF PRODUCTION  AND TRADE.    Some of us have felt that a greater freedom of international trade is not the soleremedy for the present crisis, that the crisis has revealed profound disorganisation ofproduction and distribution, and that, on this point also, joint action by the governments is necessary for the recovery of an economic system threatened by bankruptcy.    We take  the  view that concerted  action by the Governments in selected fields ofproduction and trade may be effective, either in the direction of facilitating and regulating the efforts already made by certain classes of producers, or in alleviating the unfortunate results on the general economic situation of interventions which are prompted by unduylnarrow national considerations.
                             i.   Economic Agreements.    The present crisis has put international economic agreements to the test.  Someof them have disappeared: the more solid have  held their ground;  while some new agreements have come into being under the pressure of events.    Undoubtedfy,  in  certain cases, economic agreements have tended, at least tempo-temporarily,  to maintain and stabilise prices. They have represented an element of order inthe midst of disorder, and have  constituted what one  might describe  as islands  of safety.  They have effectively contributed, in the case of certain  products and certain countries, to the prevention of conflicts and reprisals and the avoidance of tariff  increases.    On the other hand, it has been argued against them that they have passed on theeffect of the competition which  they have  eliminated  to the  economic system  as  awhole, and in particular  to the non-cartellised industries which are directly dependenton them. They have also been accused of crystallising existing situations, and so runningcontrary to the natural evolution  of economic tendencies.    However that may be, economic  agreements have become so important an element of production and trade  that it is impossible for  Governments not to take them intoaccount in their internal and external economic policy.    It is not for us to pronounce  on the  attitude which  Governments may take up inregard to economic agreements.   We consider that,  generally  speaking, international economic agreements have more chance of success if their formation is  left to the initiative-tive and free  discussion of the producers concerned, for whom they represent an alreadyadvanced stage of industrial organisation.    Some of us, however, think that the Governments might usefully take the opportunity-nity of the coming Conference to discuss the attitude they should adopt in regard to these agreements.   Such discussions might facilitate the conclusion of agreements, particu-larly in cases where the intervention  of Governments is necessary  to ensure the crgani-sation  of the production  of, and  trade in, certain staple products, especially in caseswhere the producers are not at present in a position themselves to regulate the productionand  distribution of their products.    The desirability of inter-Governmental agreements in the case of wheat  has  beenadvocated on these grounds.                                    2.   Wheat.    The question of regulating the production and export of wheat by agreements between governments has been the subject of international discussions for some  time  past.  Ithas been investigated at Geneva, Paris, Rome and London, and, more recently,  at Stresa.    Of all the proposals which have been studied, those which were submitted in Londonhave engaged our special attention.  At that time, it was proposed to apply only a systemof limitation of exports.  Some still adhere to this proposal only, but others now considerthat  it might be combined with an agreed limitation of the areas sown.  We had beforeus interesting suggestions from the Argentine Government relating to the reduction of theareas sown in the chief exporting  countries and their limitation in importing countries,as a means of absorbing gradually  the abnormal stocks which have accumulated throughthe failure of supply to adjust itself naturally to demand.    Whatever practical difficulties may stand in the way of this proposaf, the conference might note it for careful examination, in view of the seriousness of the present  situation,taking account of the lessons of  past conferences and inviting the qualified technicalorganisations to collaborate with the Governments.
                                  4.   Transport.    Among the agreements to be considered, the Conference might endeavour to ascertain whether it would not be possible to conclude agreements in connection with sea, land orriver transport, which might improve the economic condition of the transport system,while considerably reducing charges which at present represent  a heavy burden on theState budgets in the case of certain methods of transport.    In the case of shipping, the most  urgent questions arise in connection with director indirect subsidies to national mercantile marines and premiums on national  ship-building.  This policy has  certainly contributed towards the creation and maintenanceof a much greater tonnage than is required by existing international trade, so that inmany countries  shipping has become a burden on the national economy instead of a contribution to its prosperity.    We agree with the meeting of shipowners recently held at the International Chamberof Commerce that it is impossible to return to sound conditions in the shipping industryso long as the uneconomic policy of Government  subsidies continues.   This policy of excessive intervention requires to be checked by  agreement between the  Governments.At the same time,  certain possibilities of agreement might be considered with regard tothe scrapping  of old tonnage, the utilisation of existing tonnage and the laying down of new ships.    Similarly, in the case of air traffic, the subsidies granted by States or other public bodies constitute a considerable portion of the receipts of air traffic companies.  In thissphere,  as  in that of shipping, subsidies  render  competition particularly burdensome.    In the case of rail  transport, at any rate on the  European continent, endeavoursshould be made to ascertain whether it is not possible to arrive at agreements settingdefinite limits to the indirect protection of national  economic interests by means ofrailway tariffs.    Lastly, any progress which may be made by the Conference towards greater freedom in international trade should naturally lead to the  adoption of a more liberal policy in                                3.   Other Products.    International agreements have also been contemplated in the case of certain commodities-commodities, the production and sale of which are controlled to a greater or less extent by certainGovernments,  particularly  timber and coal.    With regard to timber, a meeting of experts  took place in April 1932 at Geneva,which led to an international conference being held  in June in Vienna, where a permanenttimber committee was constituted, representing five producing countries (Austria, Poland,Czechoslovakia, Roumania, Yugoslavia).   Negotiations are being carried on with a viewto restricting the total exports from these countries and concluding agreements with variousimporting countries.    With regard to coal, experts  have met at Geneva on several occasions since 1929on the initiative of the Economic  Committee of the League of Nations. The proposal tocreate an international organisation, which is being urged by the miners, would not appearto have made any progress since the last meeting, which was held in January 1930.    In both these cases, the Conference might consider whether Government action mightbe likely to lead to the conclusion  of agreements at  which the producers have so far failedto arrive.   In  any  case, to contribute to the effective solution of the crisis, the object ofsuch action should be,  not only to adjust the interests of the producing countries, but tosafeguard those of the consuming countries.
respect of international transport by river and road, since the economic importance ofthese two methods of transport is constantly increasing.                                        *                                     *     *    The  Monetary and Economic Conference wdl doubtless not be in a position to holdan exhaustive discussion on each individual subject.  If some Governments wish to raisediscussion as to agreements relating to certain products or services, it might be advisable for them to give notice of their intention without delay, to enable the Organising Com-mittee of the Council or the  Economic Committee or the Communications and TransitCommittee of the League  of Nations  to call  upon  experts representing the  principalinterests  involved to consider without delay  whether and on  what  conditions  such agreements could be concluded.
