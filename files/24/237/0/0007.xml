Memorandum by  the Home Secretary.          I circulate,  for consideration by theCabinet, the attached memorandum by Lord Trenchardoutlining his proposals for providing recreational facilities for  the Metropolitan Police.   I entirelyconcur in these proposals  and I should be glad toobtain the Cabinet1s approval of the question ofprinciple involved.J .G.HOME OFFICE:19th January, 1933.
    MEMOPANDUM BY TUB COMMISSIONER OP THEMETROPOLITAN&apos; POLICE OR RECREATIONAL FACILITIES               POR THE FORCE.          Circumstances have arisen which make it necessaryfor me to ask that the question of recreationa.l facilities forthe Metropolitan Police Force should &quot;be brought before theGovernment as early as possible.          There is no question of immediate expenditure and allI seek at the moment is the acceptance by the Government of theprinciple that expenditure on the provision of reasonableamenities and recreational facilities for the MetropolitanForce may be regarded as a proper charge on public funds.          I realise to the full that this is a peculiarlyunfortunate moment to ask for the consideration of any proposal which may involve committing the Government to expenditureeither now or in the future, and I would not put the matterforward at all if I vrere not convinced that such expenditure will produce a handsome return in efficiency, contentment and economy of man-power.          I have spoken of the acceptance of a principle, butthis is not strictly accurate as the principle of regardingpolice recreation as a. proper object for financial assistance is not a new one.   I understand that the Home Office havealready approved for grant purposes proposals made by provincialForces to spend money on the acquisition of athletic grounds.Also in the Metropolitan Force permission has been given to use for athletic purposes a piece of ground at Inber Court whichwas purchased from the Metropolitan Police Fund.   Thedifference therefore between what I am now proposing and what has already been done is really only a matter of degree.          Also from another point of view the principle isnot new as it is fully accepted in the case of the Fighting
Forces and I hope to he able to demonstrate that the need ofthe Police in this respect is even greater.          Like the Army, the navy and the Air Force, the police are a disciplined body dependent for their efficiency largely on physical fitness a.nd the spirit that animates them.   Sofar as regards physical fitness, although the occasionsrequiring special activity and endurance are not perhaps veryfrequent, alertness of mind, which is obviously dependent on full bodily health, is clearly necessary all the time.          But the more important aspect is the &quot;spirit thatanimates&quot; a Police For^e and it is in this direction that theneed for proper recreational facilities may be said to be even greater than in the Fighting Services.          In the Fighting Services men work very much more closely together and almost every phase of their activities is subject to the constant scrutiny of superior officers.   If aman is unfit or lacking in keenness the fact is immediatelyobvious and can be corrected.          The great bulk of police work on the other hand isindependent.   Individual men carry out their duties - or fail to carry them out - largely in isolation.   They work or the.yfail to work, they see things or the3r fail to see them, moreor less according to their individual inclinations.    There ismuch monotony and the life itself rather militates againstactivity of mind and body.          Without recreation of the right kind, muscle runs tofat and brain to seed.   And it is not only recreation in the active form of games and sports that is needed - this appealsnaturally more to the younger men - but recreation also in theaorepassive forms of social comforts and indoor aiuuseaents.          It is a matter of extreme difficulty - with a Forceof 20,000 men spread over an area of 700 square miles - for
officers to get to know their men.   Games,  athletics and recognised places to which men can resort when off duty giveopportunities for officers and men to meet.    The value of thisis well recognised in the Fighting Services.   The good officerplays games with his men or - if he is too old to do that -takes a keen interest in this side of their life.   In so doinghe not onl3r gets to know then hut he secures their respect and confidence.          I am absolutely convinced that at least some of the troubles from which the Police have suffered in the pa.st havebeen due to this aspect of the natter being too much neglected.This has not been due to la.ck of keenness on the part of themen themselves.   There are athletic clubs in alr.ost everyDivision and every k$nd of game from cricket to darts isplayed to some extent.   But the difficulties are enormous.Grounds have to be hired.   They are expensive a,nd hard to getat.   Except Imber Court - which is quite inaccessible to three-qua.quarters of the Force - there is no permanent centre.The need is not only for grounds of their own, but club housesalso.   There is at present only one (also at Iraber Court) .This was erected by the National Police Fund by means of a loanwhich is being stea-dily repaid.          Officers cannot mix with their men satisfactorily inborrowed pavilions and on hired grounds.   The men themselves -particularly in the inner Divisions - are discouraged by thedifficulty and expense of reaching the places where the gamesare played.          Big business organisations such as the banks, railwaycompanies,  Gas Light and Coke Company,  Barker1s  Selfridge&apos;s,Lyons and others, all provide pavilions and club houses free.Some even go further and provide the sports equipment such ascricket balls, bats and pads, footballs, etc., as well as the
larger equipment such, as furniture, motor mowers, etc.   Somefirms do not ever, charge their members- any subscriptions.          It is fairly certain that business organisations wouldnot spend large sums of money in this manner unless they were confident of securing a return in the shape of increasedfitness -.nd contentment amongst their employees.   The sameargument must clearly apply to police but with much greaterforce inasmuch as the proper performance of their work is muchmore dependent on mental and physical activity than is thecase with the ordinary sedentary worker.          There is one further respect in which the policeman isin a somewhat special position and this is that he is debarredto a large extent from availing himself of the ordinaryfacilities open to men of his type for social intercourse.   Ofcourse he has his home if he is a married nan but even married men sometimes resort to clubs or the IOCP.1 public house which isin effect for many of them a sort of clue.   Clearly it is notparticularly desirable that police officers should make a habit of resorting to public houses, and. the idea of their joiningworking men&apos;s clubs is also not much encouraged.          In the case of single men the position is still moredifficult.   Many of them live in Section Houses and about 900or more live outside, mainly in lodgings.          The Section Houses are not particularly attractiveplaces for men to spend their leisure hours in.   I am taking thisquestion up separately and it may be possible to do somethingbut, whatever is done, many years must elapse before SectionHouses can be made as attractive and comfortable as they oughtto be .          It was put to me once by a well educated man who had served as a Constable that a Constable living in a Section Housenearly always wants to go outside for recreation and enter-
tainment  in his  leisure  hours.    If he has no friends in London(and a large proportion  of the  Force come from the provinces and scotland)  cinemas  and public houses are really the only place hecan go to.    The same applies to a less extent to the single manliving in lodgings.          This is  obviously wrong,  and I feel convinced, that theprovision of club  houses reasonabljr accessible to the largest possible  number  of men will go  a long way to preventing youngConstables  from  getting  into bad company and will help to filla very real need, in  their lives.         Although this  problem is not peculiar to London it isunquestionably far more  acute in London than anywhere else.  Evenin a large  manufacturing town like Birmingham or Leeds access is comparatively easy and cheap to the fringes where the athleticgrounds are found.   It  might easily take a man an hour and a half or two hours  to get from a South Eastern or North EasternStation to  Imber Court and would cost him two or three shillingsin fares  only.          In the past, games and athletics have been a-ssisted toa considerable extent by the sale of tickets for concerts, sportsmeetings,  etc.   This was done  &quot;by door to door visiting by police officers  in uniform.,,  The objections to the practice are obviousand a definite end has now been put to it.   One of the main difficulties that  has always been felt about stopping this ticket-selling was the  harm that would be done to the various athleticclubs.   A  Committee who investigated the matter said that it wouldbe impossible to keep athletics going even in a sma.ll way without.ticket-selling.    This was no doubt true as both the central and ivisiona.1  athletic  clubs have  even with this assistance only anaged to  exist on  a somewhat  precarious and insecure basis.         It may be  asked why the National Police Fund (i.e. the und raised by the Times after  the.  General Strike in 1926) should
- O -not be able to assist.   It does assist,  and a small steadyincome is received from this source -and devoted to the reinforcement of the athletic clubs.   But the amount is notgreat.   Capital expenditure is only allowed sparingly,  and ona loan basis (repayment being required within a definite period),a portion of the fund is used for educational and other similarpurposes, and the Jletropolitan Force has a claim only on rather less than a third of the proceeds.   The net result is that thepmount received for athletics by this Force is not sufficientto make any real impression on the problem.          These are briefly the considerations which have ledme to the conclusion that I must ask the Government to give this question serious attention.          My reason for raising the matter now is that it hascome to my knowledge through inquiry that there a.re available atthe present moment two grounds which would be entirely suitablefor police purposes.   One is at Leyton and the other at Hendon.The Leyton ground is privately owned and would cost aboutcS14,000 to  15,000.   The chance of acquiring it is not likelyto remain open more than another month or two.   The Hendonground is owned by a Government Department and would costprobably between  25,000 and  30,000.          If the Government is prepared to accept the generalproposition that it would be reasonable to give some assistancein the provision of recreational and club-house facilities forthe Metropolitan Force, I could make arrangements to finance the purchase of the Leyton ground and to maintain it until I amin a position to make a proposal (as I hope to be able to do)for the Government to take it over without involving themselvesin any addition to the sum expended on the Metropolitan force as a whole.          As regards Hendon (which belongs to the Air Ministry)what I would ask is whether the Treasury could agree to the                         \
transfer of the property to the Receiver of the MetropolitanPolice - if necessary on a loan &quot;basis.    The question of paymentcould then, as in the case of Leyton,  stand over until I am ableto make further proposals for acquiring it without additional expenditure.   It would still of course be possible for theGovernment to sell it at a later date if this were subsequentlyfound to be necessary.          The question of maintenance will ^lso arise.   On thisI suggest that it would be right for the Metropolitan Police fund to accept responsibility for such raaj or items as rates, taxes,fencing, upkeep of buildings and perhaps wages, but not for equipment, rollers, mowing machines, nets, etc.          Any expenditure eventually incurred would fall on theMetropolitan Police Fund and only 50/i would be a charge on government Funds.          My intention is that if grounds were acquired I wouldappoint a Committee of senior officers who would be responsibleunder me for their proper control and management.
