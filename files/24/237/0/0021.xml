THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  February 1933.SECRET.                                               Copy No.   44O.P. 20 (33).CABINET.CONTROL  OF CROWN  LANDS  COMMITTEE.    Report on future Government Responsibility for the Administration of                              Crown Lands.    1.   ON the 20th  December,  1932,  we  reported  to  the  Cabinet  (paper cp. 443 (32)) on that  part of our terms  of reference relating to No. 4, CarltonGardens and Carlton House  Terrace.  Our recommendations on these matters were considered bv the Cabinet at their Meetings on the 21st December last(Cabinet 68 (32), Conclusion  13),  and the 26th January, 1933 (Cabinet 4 (33),Conclusion 3).   In pursuance of  the  last-named  conclusion,  the  Minister  ofAgriculture and Fisheries arranged for a statement to be  inserted  in the Presson the  1st February.  A copy of this statement is  for  convenience  of  referenceappended hereto.    2.   We deal in this  Report  with  the  remaining part of our  terms  ofreference, namely, the question of  future Government responsibility for theadministration of Crown Lands.  We have conferred with Mr. A.  S. Gaye, thePermanent Commissioner of Crown Lands, and the facts and other data have beensubmitted to us in Memoranda by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, theTreasury, the Attorney-General and  Mr.  Gaye.The Crown Lands.    3.   The Crown Lands administered by the Commissioners of Crown Landsis a Trust Estate, comprising nearly 140,000 acres of agricultural land, producingabout  100,000 a year, and valuable urban properties, mainly situated in the boroughs of Westminster  and Marylebone, producing about  1,250,000 a year.Amenity questions mainly  arise in connection with the urban properties.  On theother hand, while the agricultural estates only produce a fraction of the revenue of the  urban properties, they raise the most  frequent administrative problems.The present position with  regard to Ministerial responsibility.    4.   In 1832 the  Office of  the Commissioners of Crown Lands and the Officeof Works were  amalgamated, but, by the Crown Lands Act,  1851,  the twoOffices  were again separated.  The  main reason then given by Lord John Russellagainst the combination of the two Offices was that  there would be a real dangerof the  Governments using funds  and  other  property  belonging to the crown lands  for ordinary Government purposes, and thereby minimising the real trustcharacter of the Royal estates.    5.   In 1906, the President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries  (now the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries)  was made ex officio a commissioner of Crown Lands, and, under powers conferred upon them by the Act of 1851, theTreasury in 1906 assigned the management of the principal agricultural estatesto the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, and the management of all the otherestates to the Permanent  Commissioner,, each Commissioner being responsibleonly for the estates placed under his charge.

     6.   This arrangement continued until  the appointment of Mr.  Gaye, the present Permanent Commissioner, in 1924, when all the Crown Lands were placed under the joint management of  the Minister and Mr.  Gaye.   The  latter has described the present arrangement in the following terms :          &quot; During this period of eight and a half years there have been seven     Ministers of Agriculture and  Fisheries, and in consequence of the great     increase of work both in the  Ministry and in the Cabinet it has been quite     impossible  for any  one of  these  seven  Ministers  to attend  to  their     responsibilities as Commissioners of Crown Lands.  The work of this Office     consists of  a great and increasing  number of distinct transactions, more or     less important, all of  which have to be considered in the light of their own     special circumstances; questions of general policy seldom arise, and when a     policy is laid down the exceptions to it are apt to be more numerous and more     important than the cases in which it is literally applied.  The practice which     I have followed, with the approval of successive Ministers, is to consult them,     before committing the Commissioners, on any case which appears to me likely     either to provoke criticism in  Parliament or to be of special  interest in     connection  with the agricultural policy of the &quot;Government.   On the  whole     this practice has worked well.&quot;     7.  We  are all agreed  that  some  change in &quot;the present arrangements isdesirable, particularly in view of the controversy which has arisen in connectionwith the question of rebuilding Carlton Gardens and Carlton House Terrace.We  understand that  the Permanent Commissioner does not dissent  from this conclusion.     8.  We have carefully examined a number of proposals which have  beensubmitted to us, and it may be convenient first to mention one proposal which wehave felt unable to recommend the Cabinet to entertain.     9.  This  is, that thei*e  should  be  two ex-ojficio  Commissioners of crown lands, one the Minister  of Agriculture and Fisheries, who  would be  responsible in.respect of the agricultural estates, and the other the First Commissioner ofWorks,  who would  be responsible  for the urban estates.  We are advised by the attorney-General that there is no question but that  the  Crown  Lands must bemaintained as a separate entity, and must be administered altogether as a whole.Apart from the  general objections in principle to dual  Ministerial responsibility,we are agreed that it would be very invidious and undesirable to attempt anydivision of  responsibility  for the administration of His  Majesty&apos;s property.Moreover, there  would always  remain the  very  difficult border line cases  of developing land  which, in any case, give rise to complex administration problems.Standing Advisory Committee.     10.  We recommend in the first place that there should be appointed, apartfrom and in addition to, the Royal Fine Arts Commission, a  Standing Committeewhich the Commissioners of Crown  Lands should  be under obligation to consulton questions involving aesthetic and other important considerations,  such as town planning, zoning, &amp;c, arising in connection with their urban estates.  We arealso  agreed that this Standing Committee should consist of  not more than5  persons,  to be appointed  for a fixed term of  years  and  to  be eligible  forre-appointment.   We have discussed the question whether  the Members of theStanding Committee should all be nominated as individuals, or whether some ofthem should be representative of Local Authority and other interests.  We think,however, that the final determination, of the composition and method of appoint-ment of the Committee should be  deferred until a decision  has been  reached asto Ministerial responsibility for the future control of Crown Lands, since theMinister finally  designated would  be the party most interested.     11.  We have also reached the  conclusion that in future there should be asingle ex-officio Commissioner of Crown Lands, who should be either the Ministerof Agriculture and  Fisheries or the First Commissioner of Works.     12.  We summarise  in paragraphs 14 to 19  below two schemes for dealingwith the problem on  these lines, together with  a statement of advantages and disadvantages attaching to each  of these  schemes.  Scheme A  involves legis-lation.  Scheme B  does not.
    13.  We are advised that provisions under existing legislation are sufficientto secure both a redistribution of duties as between  the  Commissioners and adequate  consultation  with any Department  or  Body  that  the Treasury may direct.  Under sections 5 and 32 of the Crown Lands Act, 1851,  the  Treasurypossess very wide powers of assigning duties, &amp;c, as between the commissioners and under section 21 of the Act of 1927 Treasury authority is required for anypurchase or sale for an amount exceeding  1,000  and for any exchange lease orgrant.    14.  Scheme A is  as follows :       (i)  The First  Commissioner of His Majesty&apos;s Works and Public Buildings           to be the sole Commissioner for Crown Lands.  (The present divided           responsibility for the administration would rest in him alone.)     (ii)  The office  of  the Commissioner of Crown Lands to continue to have a           separate Vote.    (iii)  The  Permanent  Head of  the. office to be  styled Surveyor-General (or           Controller)  of Crown Lands and to be the Secretary of  the office and           accounting  officer for Crown Land Revenues  and for the Vote.    (iv)  Treasury directions to be issued (a) providing for consultation with the           Ministry of Agriculture on matters relating to agricultural estates,           and (b) prescribing the form of submission to the Treasury as regards           cases in which  transactions between the  Commissioner of  Crown           Lands and the Office of Works are involved.    15.  Scheme B proposes  to  make  the  Minister  of  Agriculture finallyresponsible for Crown  Lands administration, while providing him with furtherskilled advice  by means  of the Advisory  Committee  mentioned  above.   ThePermanent Commissioner would be required by Treasury Minute to carry out his duties under the direction of the Minister.    16.  The arguments in favour of Scheme A appear to us to be  as follows :      (i)  The First  Commissioner who  under  it  is designated as  the Minister           responsible  would have more time to devote to the  tasks  involved.    (ii)  The  scheme  places the administration of the very valuable  urban           properties of the Crown in the hands of a Minister who  is accustomed           to deal  with questions of urban properties.    17.  The arguments against Scheme A appear to be :       (i) It involves legislation;      (ii) It might,  as time went on, involve a danger of the Crown Lands losing           their separate identity;    (iii) It places  the agricultural properties of the Crown and His Majesty&apos;s           tenants  under a Minister whose normal  Departmental duties are not           concerned with agricultural matters.    18.   The arguments in favour of Scheme B are as follows :        (i) It does not involve legislation;      (ii)  It leaves  the agricultural estates of the Crown under the  Minister of          &apos; Agriculture.    19.   The arguments against Scheme B are as follows : -      (i)  The Minister of  Agriculture is still  left as the person  ultimately           responsible for the administration of very important urban estates;    .  (ii) Parliament may not be satisfied with assurances that  in the future the           Minister and the Advisory Committee will be  able&apos;to&apos;exercise more           real and effective control over aesthetic questions than in the past.   ; 20.,  We feel  it  desirable to  leave  it to the  Cabinet  to, decide.whether Scheme A or Scheme B should be adopted.                  .

Recommendations.    21.  Our recommendations may be summarised as follows :       (i) That the ex officio Ministerial Commissioner should be finally respon-           sible for the administration of Crown. Lands, and  that he should not,           as  at  present,  share  this  responsibility  with  the  Permanent           Commissioner.     (ii) That this object should be achieved either                (a) by Scheme A above, which involves the passage of legislation           providing that  the  First Commissioner of Works shall be the sole           Commissioner for Crown Lands; or               (b) by Scheme B above, by means of a Treasury Minute requiring           the Permanent Commissioner for Crown Lands to carry out his duties           under the direction of the Minister of Agriculture;    (iii) That in  any case a  Standing Committee should be appointed on the           lines indicated in paragraph 10 above, and that on  questions involving           aesthetic  and similar considerations in connection with  the Crown&apos;s           urban estates, the Commissioners of Crown Lands should be required           by Treasury Minute to consult with that Standing Committee.                                  Signed on  behalf of the Committee,                                          WALTER ELLIOT, Chairman.    2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,           February 3, 1933.
APPENDIX.             CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE AND 4, CARLTON GARDENS.                  Statement published on February 2, 1933.    IN view of the uneasiness which has been expressed lest some large schemeof reconstruction of Carlton House Terrace should be  embarked upon beforepublic  opinion both in  Parliament and  outside  has  been fully  consulted,  theMinister of Agriculture, as one of the Crown Commissioners, thinks that it wouldbe courteous to those who have taken interest in  the question to explain  theposition, since otherwise this could not  be done till Parliament meets on the 7th.    The facts are as follows :     In July last the Commissioners of Crown Lands, with the consent of  the -Treasury,  granted a building lease of the site of No. 4, Carlton Gardens toMessrs.  Pinchin, Johnson and  Company.   Subsequently,  the Commissionersapproved the plans of the proposed new buildings, and Messrs, Pinchin, Johnsonand Company entered into a contract with a firm of building contractors earlyin September for the demolition of the old house, and for the erection of the newblock of offices, at a cost  of approximately  60,000.   The  old  house has been demolished,  orders have been placed for  all the building materials required  forthe new house, and most of the steel work has already been erected.    Special  legislation would be required  to compel Messrs. Pinchin, Johnsonand Company to abandon their project and to release the Commissioners fromtheir  contract.   There  is no reason  to suppose  that  the  firm  would  agreevoluntarily to the cancellation of the contract; but even if they could be  induced to do so, very substantial compensation  might have to be paid.   Any  reducedfuture  user  would also involve the loss to  the  Crown  Lands Commissioners ofa portion of the improved ground rents  of  1,600 per annum secured by the lease.    The Government have had  the matter very  fully under review ever since it was first raised in Parliament,  and feel bound to state that in view of all  thecircumstances, financial and otherwise, they consider that no useful purpose wouldbe served by any further intervention  by the Government in the matter  of messrs, Pinchin, Johnson&apos;s lease of No.  4, Carlton Gardens.    The position in regard  to Carlton  House Terrace is that no decision what-ever  has been  taken concerning the  future development of the Carlton HouseTerrace site. Attention has, of course, been drawn to the increasing difficultiesof finding tenants for houses in  Carlton Gardens and  Carlton  House Terrace,and to the serious loss to the Crown  Revenues involved in the houses remaininguntenanted.  Notwithstanding these considerations, the Commissioners of crown lands  do  not propose to take any further  action  in regard to the developmentof Carlton House  Terrace until public opinion has had time  and opportunityto express itself, and these opinions have  been fully considered.
