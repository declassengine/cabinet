(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE HlpJBRTY.PJLHIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT. )                      CAB I N  E T.SECRET.                                              COPY NO . . .^7 . . .C. P. 2(5.5) -            WATERLOO BRIDGE.            Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.             It will &quot;be remembered that the Lord President   recently received a deputation from the London County Council  on   the subject of Waterloo Bridge on  behalf of the Prime Minister.             I have since seen the Chairman of the Port  of London   Authority and learned from him the views of the various   associations of interests using the  River.    Lord Ritchie made   it clear that his Authority was not  pressing for the  destruction   of the present bridge or objecting to its restoration,  provided   nothing  were done which Vvould increase the  length of  the tunnels   of the arches.             The report of Messrs.  Rendel, Palmer and Tritton,  the   Engineers retained by the London County Council to advise them   in the matter, shews that the existing bridge could be   reconditioned at a cost v/hich is estimated at  685,000 (including   the cost of corbelling out the bridge so as to provide four  lines   of traffic) and at  620,000 if the process  of corbelling out is   not adopted.             In view of the attitude  of Parliament and of the   circumstances of the case, I  think the time has now come to   intimate to the London County Council that  the Government have   come  to  the conclusion that the Bridge should be reconditioned   and I annex, for the information of the Cabinet, a copy of a   letter which it is proposed to send t.o &quot;the  Council accordingly.   It will  be observed that the  Council is also asked to arrange   for corbelling out the Bridge to take four  lines of traffic.             The Treasury have agreed that a grant of 60 per cent   should be made to the approved cost  of reconditioning the bridge   on the lines proposed.   12.1.33.,                         (Intld.)   P.J.P.
        SUGGESTED DRAFT LETTER TO the  CLERK OF THE                  LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL.                   WATERLOO BRIDGE.         I am directed &quot;by the Minister of Transport toadvert to your letter  ,58467 if the 7th November withwhich you were good enough to submit copies of the report prepared by Messrs. Rendel, Palmer and Tritton upon variousprojects for dealing with Waterloo Bridge and to thediscussion which took plsce when the Lord President of theCouncil, on behalf of the Prime Minister, received a deputatioifrom &quot;the London County Council on the 25th of November.   Anopportunity has also been taken to hear the views of the port of London Authority, through their Chairman, in accordancewith the suggestion made by the deputation.         The resolution passed by the Improvements Committeeof the Council recording their opposition to any scheme fordealing with Waterloo Bridge which would involve the retentionor perpetuation of a bridge with nine arches runs contrary tothe opinion of Parliament, and as the Council have alreadybeen informed, His Majesty!s Government could not offer any financial assistance to a scheme of which the House of commons had expressed its disapproval.         The Report now submitted by Messrs, Rendel, Palmerand Trittcn appears to advance matters to a stage at whichdecision is possible.   In the interests of road traffic., of navigation ana of employment, such a decision would be desirable:and the urgency of the problem is emphasised by zhs statement on page 7 of the Report that &quot;apart from complete collapse theexisting bridge is in as bad a condition as it can be51 *
                       - 2 -          It is assumed that the Council will readily agreethat the suggested temporary scheme for replacing the worstpiers and arches with steelwork can be ruled out from furtherconsideration, on the ground that there can he no justification for incurring an expenditure of  12^,000, of which  100,000could have no permanent value, upon a temporary scheme-          It then becomes necessary to decide whether to adoptthe process of corbelling out.   The advantages of such a course which can be adopted at the comparatively small increased costcf  65,000, are that it provides four lines for traffic whereas the existing carriageway  suffices for two effective lines only.          After giving the natter their best consideration,  *ndtaking into account all the views expressed in Parliament and elsewhere, His :tajesty&apos;s  Government have come to the conclusionthat they have no alternative but to request the London CountyCouncil to proceed to recondition the existing bridge (at an estimated cost of  685,000) as proposed  in the Engineers&apos; report and to suggest that the question of the  design to be adopted forcorbelling out the bridge should be referred to the Royal FineArt Commission for their  advice,.          The Minister will be prepared  to make a grant of 60 pecent of the approved cost of  reconditioning the Bridge on theselines..          In conclusion,  I am to say that His Majesty1 s Govemmeappreciate the spirit in which the Council have conducted their negotiations and the readiness which they have shewn to meet the many difficult positions which have arisen and are also mindfulof the thought and labour which members  of the Council have,during the past few years, expended upon the problem.
