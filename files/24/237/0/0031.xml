THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1933.SECRET.                                                Copy No.   40CP.  30 (33).CABINET.THE WORK OF THE ROYAL  AIR FORCE IN THE MIDDLE  EAST   IN ITS RELATION TO THE PROBLEM OF AIR DISARMAMENT.            MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR.    1.  I FEEL I  owe it to the Royal  Air Force overseas to acquaint mycolleagues briefly with the impressions left upon me by my recent short tour by air to Egypt, Palestine, Transjordan and Iraq.   It was a revelation to studyat first  hand the many and diverse activities of  the squadrons  in the middle east in the course of their constant vigil, year in, year out in regions as widelyvarying as  the  snow-covered  mountains  of Kurdistan in  the north and theparched deserts of  mud and sand which encircle Iraq  to the west and  south.I only wish the Cabinet as a whole could take advantage of the twentieth-centuryversion  of the flying carpet of the Arabian fairy tale, and see for themselves the absolute indispensability of the Royal Air Force, if the pax Britannica is to bemaintained and that at relatively trivial cost throughout wild and turbulentterritories, whose combined extent exceeds that of Germany.    2.  Just as the Navy polices the Seven Seas, so to  an ever-increasing  extent the aeroplane, the modern &quot; ship of the  desert,&quot;  covering hundreds of square miles  in the course of a single patrol, is policing the Middle East, restraining theactivities of the lawless and bringing succour to the distressed.  The  Royal AirForce is indeed, in the opinion  of the competent  political authorities,  the solemeans of keeping in check the forces of disorder, which, if ordinarily  latent, are all too near the surface and ready to break out the moment the strong hand andvigilant eye of the watchman are withdrawn. The air arm has proved  itself to-be the one instrument which  can deal effectively  with those  little wars  whichthere  must always be  in backward countries until we  achieve the millennium.Sometimes there have  been as many as four such little  wars  in  the space of asingle year,  but, through the judicious  use of air power,  outbreaks are becomingfewer and, when once they occur, are confined within narrow limits, and disposedof far more quickly than ever before.   In more settled  territories, in Egypt, for&apos;example, and in India, apart from the North-West Frontier and a  few other areas, the task of maintaining order rests, of course, and must continue to rest,almost solely with the  Army, who are carrying a heavy burden.   Ground  forcesagain are indispensable when disorder breaks out in a city such as Jerusalem;If the Royal Air Force has assumed a vital role in the machinery of ImperialDefence and it is my personal  conviction that this role is destined to  grow in scope  and importance I wish to emphasise that there remain vast fields of workwhich only the older services can undertake.   The three services  must, in short,continue to fulfil complementary  roles, all equally essential  in  their differentspheres to the peace and security of the British Empire.    3.  From London, it is impossible to appreciate fully the revolution  that theaeroplane has  wrought in the  control  of  the  extensive and  still  primitiveterritories which I had the privilege of visiting in the course of my tour.  some idea of the work which is being  accomplished and of  the extent to  which theRoyal Air Force has become the  keystone of the whole  delicate Middle Eastern
structure is given in Sir F. Humphrys&apos; despatch of. the .28th December, 1932,which the Foreign Secretary has recently circulated to the Cabinet (CP. 4 (33)),and by which all my colleagues  [ am sure have been duly impressed.  Sir Franciswrites with  complete independence  of judgment,  and  there  attaches  to  histestimony all  the weight of thirty-three years&apos; service as  a  soldier in SouthAfrica and elsewhere and subsequently as a  political officer of ripe experienceacquired on the North-West Frontier of India and in Afghanistan before he tookup his present office in  Iraq some four years ago.   His grave warning  of theserious  consequences which would inevitably  follow if  aerial bombing wereprohibited  and it became &quot; known to the warlike tribes of Iraq that the claws ofthe Royal  Air Force had been clipped and  its teeth  extracted &quot;  must surelyinfluence our attitude towards any extreme  policy of air disarmament such asabolition which may be developed at Geneva at the Disarmament  Conferenceunder the pressure of a preponderance of States which have no responsibilities ofthis description themselves and, consequently,  no real  knowledge of them.    4.  Sir Francis Humphrys has now added his emphatic and final verdict tothat of his predecessors,  Sir Percy Cox and Sir Henry Dobbs. who have testifiedthat the use of the air arm in these regions, apart from being the only practicablemethod of covering the vast distances involved, is the cheapest, the most effective and the most humane instrument at our disposal. He further  confirms the viewpreviously  expressed by  political officers of wide experience on the North-west frontier that air operations are likely to leave less of a legacy of resentment thanground operations.  The native troops of the  Iraq Army, the only ground forces now  available  in that  country  for  active operations,  might, in  Sir FrancisHumphrys&apos; opinion,  be all too prone to indulge in pillage and misconduct,  andthe tribes in their turn  would become so embittered  as to offer a truculent anddesperate resistance, whereas  under present conditions  they  submit  far  more readily to the continuous and irresistible, but at the same time merciful, pressure from the air.     5.  In this connection I must draw attention to one vital point which arisesout of the  Foreign Secretary&apos;s covering Note to the despatch in question.  It is there tentatively suggested  that the reservation  in regard to the use of aircraft and bombing   for  -police  purposes in outlying places&quot; will  meet  the  over-whelming objections pointed out by Sir Francis Humphrys  to any policy whichwill result either in  the removal of the Royal Air Force or its paralysis by theprohibition of bombing.   I  fear this is not so.     Sir  F. Humphrys analyses the facts with cold and  convincing logic.   TheRoyal Air Force in the Middle East has two vital roles to fulfil :-          (1)  Defence against external aggression.         (2)  Maintenance of internal order.     6.   The reservation as regards police work will certainly cover the latter,so long  as  we  can maintain a  distinction between Europe  and  &quot;outlyingplaces,&quot; which is bound, in my opinion, to lead to early difficulties.  (I hope my colleagues will forgive my  expressing at this point in parenthesis the dismay I feel  at  seeing  that this  reservation has  been omitted  from the so-called &quot;Programme  of Work &quot; recently announced at Geneva and communicated to the  Press.  Journal after journal  has assumed and  in terms stated that this  programme is  a &quot;  plan,&quot; comparable to the French  &quot; plan&quot;;  and I  have been inundated  with questions  by those  interested  as to the meaning  of this apparent  volte-face in policy.)   But as  regards  the  former, viz.,  defence against  external aggression,  which  Sir  Francis actually  puts  first in  order of  importance,   I  suggest  that  air  action strictly  defensive  action  1 may remark in  passing against regular  enemy  forces  invading Iraq  could not possibly  be  brought under  the  heading of police  work.  The threat may come, as Sir Francis points out, from Turkey, Persia or Saudiyah Arabia.  The first two are members of the League of Nations.  That this is no mere academic. question is proved by the fact that in 1924 Turkish regular forces actually crossed the Iraq frontier.   Immediate  air action was taken against them with  great effect and  what might well have developed into a. large-scale invasion was checked, and  the enemy driven out of the areas into which they had penetrated.  Again, in 1928, thousands of fanatical Akhwan from Nejd made continuous incursions over
a. front of several hundred miles on the extreme southern border of Iraq.  Evenarmoured cars could not get to grips with them in certain areas of soft and sandydesert.  Aircraft in flue course disposed of this grave threat to security effectivelyand with a minimum of Casualties to either side.  I repeat that I do not see howoperations of this character,  above all if directed against regular troops&apos; (as/ in.the Turkish case), can  possibly be classified under the head of police work.  &quot;Thesame  considerations apply to Aden, where aircraft, in conjunction with  local forces, ejected the troops of the Imam from the territory of tribes whom we wereby treaty pledged to protect, but whom we had to the great detriment of Britishprestige throughout the Middle East found ourselves powerless to assist, despite their  pitiful pleas over a period of years  for deliverance  from a brutal andoppressive invader.  The  Imanrs troops lie waiting across  the  border;  if  the single squadron at Aden were withdrawn,  or  forbidden to  bomb,  the tribes towhom we are in honour bound would be doomed.    7.  All these operations, I would  again emphasise, are beyond dispute of a wholly defensive character, which throws into relief the inherent fallacy of trying to  classify   the  aeroplane  as  an  essentially  offensive   weapon.   without seeking to reopen at this juncture the question of whether we have not becomeunduly involved in an  approach  to  the problem of  Air Disarmament which isfraught with the very gravest dangers to the British Empire, I hope my colleagues will agree with me that Sir Francis Humphrys&apos;s despatch, and the instances ofair action I have quoted in the preceding paragraph,  show up  the truly theatricalunreality of any sweeping prohibition of air bombardment as a whole.  For,  when we come to  the &quot;thorough examination &quot; of the whole  problem which we have offered, in our latest statement of Disarmament policy, to undertake, if the  otherPrincipal Air Powers  will collaborate, it is essential that these vital considera-tions  shall be kept constantly in mind.                  *    8.  The idea of &quot;outlawing &quot; a nation which employs air bombardment (aswe applied  it  against the Turks  in  1924)  against  invading forces in its ozvnterritory  is  surely  fantastic.   Equally,  it   is  to  me   inconceivable  that,when  it  came to  the  point,  world  public  opinion would  condemn  theuse of the  air  arm  against (say)  warships  bombarding its  coastal  bases and  naval  arsenals;  or  mass formations  of  tanks  with which  an enemy and  aggressor  State had breached its frontiers.   Quite obviously  the  bombis simply an aerial shell (an ordinary artillery  shell  could perfectly well be used at a pinch, though it would not, of course, be as effective except for purposes ofindiscriminate  bombardment),  and its employment  is  no less- and no more permissible  than that  of a shell fired from land or naval  guns.  It is surelyimmaterial whether the propellent force is the aeroplane plus gravity as in thecase of the bomb, or cordite as in the  case of gunfire.   The morality or  legality of the discharge of a bomb, just as much as of an artillery shell, should dependentirely on  the nature of the  target  at which it is aimed.  Warships, tanks,invading enemy forces, bands of murderous marauding tribesmen are obviouslypermissible  targets.  Great centres of population  which cannot be evacuated,should, on the other hand, be as immune from air attack as (with, however, rather-wide  exceptions) they are from sea and land bombardment to-day.    9.  It seems to me that the confusion of thought at Geneva  on this subject is a real danger. That is why I have throughout urged that we should concentrate on measures for the protection of the civil population.  I believe world conscienceis ripe for such measures.  They can be  shewn  to be reasonable, and, as  such,there  is perhaps some prospect of  their observance even under the stress of war.But the absolute prohibition of air bombardment in all places and at all times,even for purely defensive purposes and  against such targets as tanks a&quot;nd warships in action, is a  measure so sweeping and so demonstrably irrational that it  canstand no possible chance of observance when hostilities have broken out.  and once the international  instrument embodying such a  prohibition  has been brokenin one direction,  it would inevitably,  in my humble judgment, go  by the boardcompletely.  Indiscriminate air attacks on the civil population would ensue, andthe whole fabric of international engagements  would be brought into disrepute.In trying to achieve  too much, Geneva would  in fact  have achieved nothing;-it would have lost the substance for the shadow.   1.....H &apos; &apos;  - -  - a.....&apos; &apos;             &apos;U&apos;;&apos;&apos;        &apos;            .    -  jj-    Air Ministry, February  10, 1933.
