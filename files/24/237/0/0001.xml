COMMITTEE ON THE TOTALISATOR OH GREYHOUND                     RAGING TRACKS.                        R E ? J R ?.                At their Meeting on December 21st 1932      (Cabinet 68 (32) Conclusion 12) the Cabinet agreed that      a Cabinet Committee composed as follows:-         The Secretary of State for Home Affairs (in the Chair)         The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,         The Secretary of State for Scotland,         The Attorney-General.         The Lord Advocate0      should meet after Christmas as soon as a Report was      received from the Royal Commission on Lotteries and      Betting, to consider the nature of the policy to be      adopted as to the use of totalisators on greyhound racing      tracks, and that the Home Secretary should have discretion,      if he thought necessary, to consult the Committee on the      question4&quot;&apos;whether any special legislation was required to      prevent evasion of the lav/ in respect of Tote Clubs.                Y/e have carefully considered the Interim Report      dated 5th January 1933 of the Royal commissioner  For      convenience of reference a copy of this Report in attached      hereto.              It vail  be  observed that  the  Royal  Commission are     impressed by the  spread of organised facilities for     betting and gambling and of the habit  of betting     and gambling.   They clearly state that the  use of totalisat-     ors, whether in clubs or on greyhound tracks, for betting pur-     poses involves a grave social evil as providing practically     unlimited facilities for continuous gambling, and they say
that the gambling instinct of the population at large isbeing increasingly exploited by persona Tor their ownfinancial gain.  Regarded from this point of view theto tali sc. tor appears to then to be a grave danger and theyconsider that totaliaator betting in clubs and on greyhoundtrades should be brought to an end as soon as possible.The Oonriiission&apos;s actual recommendation contained in paragraph78 of their Report reads as follows:-     &quot;73.  Our recommendations therefore5 is that         the conduct  in any place of totalisator         betting with persons resorting thereto ,         whether&quot;on a credit or cash basiss should         be declared illegal in England and Scotland         save as provided by the Racecourse Betting         Acts 1928e  Totalisator betting in other         circumstances than those referred to in         this paragraph is a matter which we         reserve for our&quot; final Report,&quot;          We are advised that the legal position is asfo Hows:          In Iftigland and Tales the Divisional Court inShuttleworth v0 Leeds Greyhound Racing Associations decidedthat the operation of a totalisator on a greyhound trackin circumstances where the operators received money and paido\it the suns received less a percentage to the holders of winning tickets constituted an offence under the Betting Act,1853-?  This decision also covers the operation of a totalisa-tor under similar conditions  in a Clubo  The Attorney-Generaladvises that in his view it is immaterial whether the bettingthrough a totalisator is on a credit or cash basis-or whetherthe amount deducted from the  summon staked and retained by the operators purports to be merely sufficient to pay workingexpenses0
          In Scotland, however, in the c se of Strathern v.Scottish Greyhound Racing Company (which was decided&quot;before the Divisional Courfs decision in the Leods case)it was held that the operation of a totalisator did not constitute an offence against the Act of 1853.Machinery exists, however, by which proceedings may betaken in Scotland to have the Strathern case reconsidered.We are informed by the Lord Advocate that a re-hc-aring-e-  the Strathern case may well result in the lav/ in Scotlandbeing declared to be the same in this respect as it hasbeen declared to be in England and Wales.          We are advised that the operation of Totalisatorsin clubs and on greyhound tracks in the manner indicated above is at present illegal in England and Wales and will,the Lord Advocate hopes, be declared illegal in scotland in the near future.   It is important therefore- to note  that legislation would be necessary to legalise the use ofTotalisators, whether subject to restriction or regulationor not, in clubs or on greyhound tracks, and that legislationcan only be avoided if it is decided to enforce the lawas it has now been declared.          With regard to  the Tote clubs we are agreed  that thelaw as now declared in England and Wales should be enforced,and we understand that if this is done *it may be expectedthat  the  clubs will all be  closed in the near  future.          We think that the  lav/  as declared  should be  enforcedin regard to Totalisators on greyhound  tracks.   No  doubtthis  will be represented  in  some quarters as  an  undue  andunwarrantable interference  with the  liberty  of  the  subject.It v/ill be strongly maintained that, so long  as betting  inthis  country is  not made  illegal, there  can be no  justification for prohibiting  this  particular  form of betting, especiallyhaving  regard  to  the  fact that Totalisator betting  on  horseracecourses  is allowed under Statutory Authority.
 It  will  also be urged that it. is unfair and illogical to prohibit betting by means of a machine while no steps are taken even to restrict the volume of betting through bookmakers; such a policy would in effect tend to give a monopoly &apos;. o the bookmakers on the greyhound tracks. It  will, moreover, be represented that the prohibition of  Totalisators will cause loss to the proprietors of the racing tracks and of the Totalisator Companies and will give rise to some unemployment.     The arguments against any form of legalisation  ofTotalisators on greyhound tracks seem to us, however, to bevery strong.   V/e doubt whether the House of Commons  or public opinion would favour the introduction of legislation to legalise Totalisators on greyhound tracks and it mustbe recognised that, in addition to the numerous personswho are opposed on religious or moral grounds to betting inany form, there exists a very large body of opinion  throughoutthe country which is specially opposed to the use of theTotalisator in connection with greyhound racing.  The policyof the Legislature in regard to  betting legislation  has alwaysbeen not that betting shall be made impossible but that the keeping of places where betting is carried on as a business for profit with the result that  people are encouraged to resort thereto,  must be suppressed.    To legalise theTotalisator on the tracks, even with restrictions and subject to regulation, would run counter to this principle.It would bring them under the aegis and protection of theState which would have to assume responsibility for activities which constitute a grave social and industrial evil.     It is no doubt true that in the absence1 of Legislation, the anomalous position will result that on greyhound tracks it will be illegal to bet through a Totalisator but legal to bet through a/
         bookmaker at any rate if no special charge is made to         bookmakers for admission.    It must, however, be remembered         that the Totalisator is a very recent development and         that there is reason to believe that its use in connection         with greyhound racing has in some instances been fraudulent         and corrupt.               With regard to possible losses to the proprietors of        racing tracks and unemployment, it  should be remembered        that when greyhound racing first started, those  concerned        had been most definitely warned that they had no vested        interest.   It  is  at least doubtful how  many of  these  tracks        would in fact have to close down if bookmakers are allowed        to continue,  and  in answer to  the charge  of  throwing some        men out of  employment it may be argued that  the  Government        are treating  the problem on the basis  that totalisator        betting on  greyhound racecourses is a  social  and        industrial evil.               We  submit to the  Cabinet the following conclusions        and recommendations:-           (a)  Tote Clubs;   England and Wales.               The law  should be allowed to t alee  its  course,               in which event it may be assumed that  the Clubs               will disappear in the immediate future.          .

Scottish Greyhound Racing Company            &apos;\  with a view  to legal position in Scotland being               brought  into conformity with the position in               England  and  Wales.           (b)  Totalisators on Greyhound Racing Tracks.               No legislation should be introduced to legalise               these Totalisators  and  the law should  be  allowed               to take  its  course.           (c)  If the Cabinet accept the above suggestions, the               Government  in announcing their policy  with regard               to greyhound racing  tracks should  make  it  clear               that to  enable totalisators  to continue on these               tracks legislation would be  required and  that
the Government are not prepared to introduce such legislation.   It is not possible intheir view to deal with the problem ofbetting piecemeal and the question of bookmakermust be reserved for consideration in the lightof the further recommendations of the RoyalCommission.

ROYAL COMMISSION  ON  LOTTERIES ANDt                       BETTING                          (1932-3)                INTERIM   REPORT     TO THE KLNG&apos;S  MOST  EXCELLENT  majesty may IT PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY,  We,  the  undersigned  Commissioners,  having  been  appointedby  Royal  Warrant &quot; to  enquire  into  the  existing  law and  thepractice thereunder relating  to  lotteries, betting, gambling andcognate matters, and to report what changes, if any, are desirable and  practicable :&quot;HUMBLY SUBMIT TO youb  MAJESTY THE FOLLOWING REPORT.                        INTRODUCTORY.  1. We have  held  21  meetings  for  hearing oral evidence,  inaddition to meetings for discussion.   We have heard evidence from89 witnesses. We  have virtually completed the  hearing of evidence on  the  matters  referred  to  us, but some time  must necessarilyelapse  before we  are  in  a  position  to submit  recommendationscovering the whole  field of our enquiry.  In these  circumstances wethink it right to deal in an interim  report with one aspect of out enquiry which has become  of  urgent practical  importance.   Werefer to the development of certain forms  of  totalisator  or pari-mutuel betting.  2. At the outset  it is necessary, by way of introduction, to makebrief reference to the different methods  of betting and to the main provisions of the criminal  law as to betting.Methods of Betting.  3. The main  distinction is between betting  with a bookmaker,and totalisator or pari-mutuel betting in which  the odds are deter-mined  directly  by  the  amounts staked by backers.  These formsmay best be explained  in detail by reference to the betting which takes place on horse  racing.  A bookmaker on  a racecourse bets at  stated or  fixed odds agreed between him and  the backer at  the time when  the bet is made.This is known  as  ante-post betting.   Such bets are, of course,   17611                                                A 2
normally made in the interval  before the race  to which they  refer,and the bookmaker may vary  the odds which  he offers to backersaccording to  the amounts which he  finds are being  staked on ea^horse.   The object of the bookmaker is in theory to make a &quot; roundbook &quot;  so  that the amounts staked  with him on each horse andthe odds which he has  offered so combine  as to assure him of  a profit whichever horse  wins.  In  practice, however, this objectmay not always be attained.  4. Off the  course bookmakers  also do  a certain amount of this form of betting in the case of the  more important races.   Mostoil the course betting is, however,  done at starting price, it  being agreed that the bet  shall be at the odds prevailing on the coursejust before the  start  of the race.   It  has become  the custom  torecognise  as  the  official starting prices, the  prices   recorded  bythe representatives of two  sporting newspapers, who make a rapidsurvey of the odds which bookmakers in  the more important ringsare offering just before the start of  the race.  o. The  essential feature  of  pari-mutuel or  totalisator betting isthat the odds are determined  on the conclusion of  the betting bythe  total  amount  of  money  staked  on  the   several  horsesby their backers.  The normal procedure is as follows.    Anyonewishing to back a horse in  a race, buys one or  more tickets on thathorse ; the tickets being all of  the same value, say &apos;2s.  or multiplesof that unit.   The proceeds of all  the tickets sold in respect  ofeach race  or event are pooled.   A predetermined percentage  ofthat pool is  deducted and  paid to  the  owners or operators of  thetotalisator  or pari-mutuel,  out  of which the expenses  of operation and other charges are defrayed.  On the result of the race or event the remainder of the pool is  divided  equally by the number  of winning tickets or units, and  the resulting amount is the &quot; divi-dend &quot; payable on each winning unit.   The  percentage  deducted from  the pool  is normally  10  per cent, in  this country,  but it is usually provided that the  dividend  shall  be rounded  down to  the nearest convenient  figure, the  difference  which accrues to  the operating  company  being  described as  &quot;breakages&quot;; this pro-vision  results in increasing the  percentage deducted from 10  percent, to say  11 or 12 per  cent.  6. Strictly  speaking a totalisator  is  the mechanism whereby inpari-mutuel  betting the amounts staked on  each  horse, and  thetotal amounts staked on all the horses  in a race, are automaticallytotalled.   In  recent  years, however,  the term  &quot;  totalisator &quot;  or&quot; tote &quot; has  been commonly applied to  pari-mutuel betting whetheror not mechanically operated,  and we  so use  the term.   Thus theRacecourse Betting Act, 1928,  defines the expression &quot; totalisator &quot;as  &quot; the contrivance for betting known  as the totalisator or pari-mutuel, or any other machine or  instrument of betting  of  a  likenature, whether mechanically  operated or not.&quot;
Existing law as lo betting.^ 7. Betting, in itself, is not illegal,  but restrictions  have beenplaced upon betting conducted  in  certain circumstances  and  incertain  places.  The main statutory provisions which  concern us in the presentconnection  are  contained  in the Betting  Act, 1853,  the StreetBetting Act, 1906, and the Racecourse Betting Act, 1928.  8. The Act of 1853, was passed to suppress ready money bettinghouses  which had recently  sprung  up  in large numbers  in  the metropolis  and  other large  towns.   Under this  enactment it  is,broadly speaking, illegal under penalties,  to keep or use any house,office, room, or other place, Cor the purpose of the owner or occupieror user      (a) betting  with persons resorting  thereto,  or      (b) receiving money in advance in respect of bets or trans-    actions in the nature of bets.  Section 1 of the Act of 1853, to  which we  refer again  later, isset out  in Appendix I.  9. The Act is framed in wide terms.  Its provisions have beenheld  to cover betting in certain circumstances in public houses,clubs, and  racecourses,  depending  on  whether a bookmaker  canbe said  to &quot; use a place &quot; for the purpose  of betting with persouswho resorted thereto.  &quot; Resorting  &quot; has always been  interpreted as meaning resorting in person.  Under  the Street Betting Act, 1906, it is illegal to frequent orloiter in a street or other public place for the purpose of bookmakingor making or settling bets.  10. Under the Racecourse Betting Act, 1928, it is legal  on an approved horse  racecourse on horse  racing&quot; days for the racecourse betting Control Board to operate a totalisator, and for a bookmakerto conduct  his  business  without regard to the  provisions of  theBetting  Act, 1853.   The provisions of  the Act of 1928 are more fully  dealt with in paragraphs 17 to 20 below.  11. The effect of  these enactments may be broadly summarisedby  saying that betting, where layer and backer resort together, isonly  allowed freely  on approved horse  racecourses.  The policy ofthe legislature has been  to  impose prohibitions or restrictions onthis type of betting  if carried on elsewhere.      INTEODDCTION OF THE TOTALISATOR TO THIS COUNTRY.              THE RACECOURSE BETTING ACT, 1928.  12. The pari-mutuel system, of betting was first adopted in Franceabout 1870,  and  mechanism  was applied to the system in NewZealand  in  1880.   The  system was adopted  in  certain of  the   17611                                                   A 3
Dominions, and in many foreign countries, but it was believed thatthe use of a totalisator in this country came within the provisionsof the Betting Act, 1853, and other Acts.                      0  13. The movement  for the  introduction  of the totalisator  intothis  country came from the Jockey Club and the National HuntCommittee.  For the purpose of making betting contribute to themaintenance of the  sport of  horse racing these bodies desired tosee the  law so altered as to  permit of the totalisator or  pari-mutuelbeing instituted on  racecourses under their rules, and of book-makers  being charged fees on a graduated  scale.    A  private member&apos;s Bill to this end was introduced in the House of commons in 1928, obtained a second reading, and was referred to a StandingCommittee.  14. The Government of the day decided that the Bill should be modified in two particulars  :       (i) That, as the Bill would have the effect of rendering legal,    in certain places, actions which remained illegal elsewhere, the    body responsible for denning the places where such exemptions    from the law should operate,  should be  a  statutory body;      (ii)  That the Bill should apply to any course where racing    with horses took place,  and not only to courses under the rules    of the Jockey Club and the National Hunt Committee.  These alterations were embodied in the Bill which passed into lawin August, 1928.  15. It should  be  noted that at  this date  the Betting Duty  wasin operation under  the provisions, since  repealed, of the  finance act, 1926, and it was urged  in favour of the introduction  of thetotalisator that it would assist in the collection of the duty.  16. It should further be  noted, as indicating  the  field  withinwhich the totalisator  was  expected  to operate,  that  horse race-courses  are situated  all over the country, are  not concentrated in urban areas, and that in most  cases racing  at a  racecourse takes place on only 6 to 10  days in a  year.  The  greatest  number ofdays&apos; racing under the rules of the Jockey Club at any one course is 22 days a year at the Eowley Mile course at Newmarket.  Further, the promoters of the Bill made it clear that the objectof the measure was, not to  create additional betting facilities, butto direct some portion of the existing betting  into a new channel.  17. The Eacecourse Betting Act, 1928, the  full text of whichwill be  found in Appendix II, set up a statutory  board, the Race-course  Betting  Control Board, composed   of  12  members,  theChairman  and  four  other  members  being  appointed  by  your majesty&apos;s Ministers.  The Act  makes it lawful for the Board orany  person authorised by them,  to operate totalisators on horseracecourses, approved by them, on days when  horse races take place.
  18. The Act provides that the  percentage  to be  deducted frommoneys staked by means of the totalisator should  be  paid  into afind, and that after meeting operating and other charges and any sums devoted to charity, the moneys in the fund should be applied in accordance with a scheme prepared by  the Board and approvedby the Secretary of State, for  purposes  conducive to the improve-nient of breeds of horses or the sport of horse racing.  19. The Act  also  lays  it  down that  before  a  racecourse  is approved  by the Board, a  place  on the racecourse shall be  pro-vided where bookmakers may carry on their business and to whichthe public can resort for the purpose of betting.  In  this respect the provisions of the Betting  Act,  1853, as interpreted  by theCourts, do not  apply  to approved horse racecourses.   (See para-graph  10  above.)   The  Act places  a  limit on  the  charges  whichbookmakers may be called upon to pay.  20. The Act penalises any betting transaction, whether  on thetotalisator  or  otherwise, on an approved  racecourse with persons under 17 years of age.  21. It  is  to be noted that Parliament  took  the  view that theoperation  of the totalisator  should  be supervised  by  a statutoryboard, and  that the surplus funds derived  therefrom should be devoted to objects connected with horse breeding and  the supportof horse racing.            LEGAL DECISIONS AS TO THE TOTALISATOR.  22. It is, of course, obvious that Parliament,  when it passed theBacecourse Betting Act, 192S, regarded the  operation  of a  totali-sator for  ready  money  betting  as one requiring  special statutorysanction.   Subsequently,  however, a  number of  legal decisionsthrew  doubt  upon this  view.   The first of these  was the decision in the case of Attorney-General v. Luncheon  and Sports  Club.*The  case concerned a sports club which among other activities had operated  since 1922 a mechanical totalisator  on a credit basis forthe use of its members,  a percentage of  the takings being payable to the company  owning  the club.  It  was admitted that the com-pany  as the  bookmaker was liable  to a  duty of  10  per annumunder the Finance Act,  1926.  The point in  dispute was whetherthe company  was also  liable for payment of  a  percentage on thebets  made with  it as a  bookmaker.  The House of  Lords in 1929held that  those  who made use of the totalisator were  not bettingwith the operators of the totalisator.  23. It appeared to follow from  this decision that the owners oroperators  of  a totalisator could not be convicted (under  the  first part of section 1 of the  Betting Act, 1853) of keeping a place forbetting with other persons who resorted thereto.* (1929), A.C. 400.
  24. Soon after this decision the first totalisator was  set up on agreyhound track.   We deal later with the spread of totalisatorson greyhound tracks and other places outside the provisions of tCfcAct of 1928.   It is convenient, however, to deal at this point withthe other decisions of the Courts as to the  operation of  totalisators.  25. The legality of  the operation of  totalisators was directlychallenged on  several occasions.   Thus,  in the Scottish case ofStrathern y,. Scottish  Greyhound Racing Company * the High Courtjf Justiciary decided  that no offence against any part  of section 1of the Betting  Act,  1853, had been committed  by  the companyoperating the totalisator at the Carntyne greyhound track, Glasgow.  26. In  England, proceedings  were taken at Liverpool quarter sessions against the  operators  of the  totalisator at  Stanley Park(Liverpool) for offences against the Betting  Act, 1853, and  theGaming Houses Act, 1854, and at common law.  The defendantswere  acquitted  on a  direction by the Recorder that  as a  matterof law no offence  had been committed.  27. It had been held in a case in 1871 (Tollett v. Thomas) t thatthe operation of a totalisator in a place to which the  public have access would constitute an offence under a  provision in  the VagrantAct Amendment Act, 186S, directed  against gaming with  an  instru-ment of gaming at a game of chance.  In 1931, on  proceedingsbeing taken  under this provision  (as re-enacted  in  the VagrantAct Amendment Act, 1873), against  persons operating  a  totalisatoron a  greyhound track, it  was  held  by the King&apos;s Bench division in Everett v. Shand,i that a race could not be described  as a gameof chance and  that therefore Tollett v. Thomas had been wronglydecided.  28. So far  as England is concerned, the most important  case is Shuttletvorth v. Leeds  Greyhound Racing Association.  In  this case the Leeds Stipendiary in May, 1932, decided that  in law nooffence against the second part of section 1  of the Betting Act, 1853,was committed by the  operators of  a totalisator on  a greyhoundtrack who received ready money and paid out the sums received,less  a fixed percentage, to the holders of winning tickets.   On appeal by  way of case  stated the Divisional  Court  heldon 16th December,  1932, that the operation of a totalisator inthose circumstances constituted  an  offence against that  branch ofthe second part of section 1 of the Betting Act, 1853,  which refers to the receipt  of  money as a consideration for an undertaking topay  thereafter  money on a contingency  relating to  a race.   29. The position is,  therefore, that in England the  operation ofa totalisator for the receipt of money or valuable thing  as  a con-* (1930), J.C. 24.    t (1S71), 35 J.P. 359.    J (1931), 2 K.B. 522.
 si deration for a promise to pay money  on the result of a race, is illegal under the Betting Act, 1853.  That Act of course does not0pply  to horse racecourses approved under the Racecourse Betting Act,&apos;1928.   30.  In Scotland, however, the  operation  of a  totalisator,  as already  mentioned, has  been held in  the case  of Strathern v. Scottish Greyhound Racing Company, not to  constitute an offence against the Betting Act, 1853.  There  are thus different decisions in the two  countries proceeding  on the same  enactment.  We are not  aware  whether,  as is sometimes done in such cases,  further proceedings will be taken in Scotland  with a view to having the decision in the case  of Strathern reconsidered, in  view of the decision in the subsequent  case  of Shuttleworth v. Leeds Grey- Itound Racing Company.   31.  As regards totalisator clubs in England,  although the decision in the Leeds wise dealt with totalisators  on  greyhound tracks, it clearly covers the operation of a  totalisator under similar conditions in a club.   32.  In Scotland  it  follows from the decision in  Strathern v. Scottish  Greyhound  Racing  Company that   the  operators of  a totalisator in a tote club cannot be held to commit an offence against section 1 of the Betting Act. 1853.   Proceedings have also been  taken against tote clubs under other Acts.  Thus summary proceedings were brought against  the keeper of a tote club  in Paisley under  section 407  of  the Burgh  Police (Scotland)  Act, 1892.   The  Magistrate convicted on  a charge of keeping a  betting house, but the  High Court of  Justiciary on  a stated case, quashed the conviction.   Proceedings were also taken against the managers of a tote club hi Glasgow under section 15 of the Glasgow  Police (Further Powers) Act, 1892,  on  a charge  of keeping a  betting house or a  gaming house ; but a conviction was  not obtained.   An appeal has been lodged with the High Court of Justiciary and is now pending.   The legality of totalisator clubs in various burghs  in Scotland has  not, therefore, yet been finally determined.  So far, however, they have not  been held to  be illegal.   ADOPTION OF TOTALISATORS OUTSIDE THE PROVISIONS  OF THE                 RACECOURSE BETTING ACT, 1928. Greyhound  tracks.   33.  We  are  not, of course, concerned  with  greyhound  racing as such, but  only with  the  facilities for  betting connected with it, and in particular the use of the totalisator.  It is,  however, necessaiy for our present purpose to give some account  of  the  development of greyhound racing in this country.   34.  The racing of greyhounds after a mechanical hare was started in this country at  Manchester in 1926.  At first it  spread  rapidly
but  after about two years  it appeared to niarry observers to havereached  its limit.   Towards the end of 1927 the directors of mostof the then existing greyhound tracks united for the purpose ^forming  a controlling authority over  the  sport.  For  this purposetwo  bodies were set up,  the  National Greyhound  Racing Club, tocontrol the conduct of the racing itself, and the National greyhound racing Society to  deal with  the administrative side of greyhound racing, and to exercise a controlling  influence over the promotion of fresh  tracks.  These bodies  are separate  bodies, but their rulesare so framed that no company can  belong to the Club  which isnot accepted as a member by the Society,  and vice versa.  35. Most of the then existing  tracks  joined  these two organisationsat their  inception  in 1928.   In a large number of cases,  however,where applications for the licensing  of new tracks were made tothe  Society subsequent  to  that date  and refused, the promotionhas  nevertheless proceeded.    Early  in  1932, a  rival controllingorganisation was  set up called the  British  Greyhound  TracksControl Society.  The position  on the 10th December, 1932, was as follows :     Tracks  affiliated  to  the  National   Greyhound       Racing Society     ...     ...     ...     ......     50    Tracks affiliated to  the British Greyhound  Tracks       Control  Society     ...     ...    ...     ...     ...     14    Other  tracks    .*.................   123  In addition,  55 further tracks were  reported on the  same  date asprojected or believed to  be about to open.  So far as concerns the  Metropolitan area,  the tracks where thereare very  large attendances appear to be all  affiliated to  the  NationalGreyhound Racing  Society.   Complete particulars as to attendancesin other  areas are  not available.  36. The  larger greyhound  tracks are almost all situated  either in or on  the outskirts of densely populated urban districts.   Racingtakes place in some cases three times a week, in many as oftenas five, six or seven times a week.  Most of the meetings take placein the evening, the  tracks being flood-lit during  winter months.The  meetings  last  about two hours and races may take  place  asoften as  every quarter of an  hour.  From the first there  has beena large volume of  betting on the tracks,  and it is very generallyadmitted that greyhound tracks would not prosper apart  from thebetting facilities which they afford.  37. It is significant to compare  the betting facilities afforded by horse racecourses and greyhound  tracks in the  metropolitan area.   Within a 15 mile radius of  Charing  Cross there are sevenhorse racecourses  with 187  days&apos; racing  a  j&apos;ear.   (Two  of theseracecourses, Greenford Park, where trotting races  take place, andNortholt Park, where racing takes place under  Pony Turf  Club
rules, account for 124 of the 187  days&apos; racing.)   In the same areathere are 23 greyhound tracks with over 4,000 days&apos; racing.C3S.  In passing it may  be noted  that  under  the RacecoursesLicensing Act, 1879, no horse racecourse may  be set up within10 miles of  Charing Cross unless licensed  by the  Justices,  andthat only one course is so licensed (Alexandra Park, with six days&apos;lacing a year).  There are 15 greyhound tracks,in operation within10 miles of Charing Cross.  39.  Neither in  the Metropolitan area,  nor elsewhere, have theLocal Authorities any control over the erection of greyhound trackswithin their areas, except in respect of areas covered by town plan-uing schemes and then only for limited purposes.  40.  A Private Member&apos;s  Bill  (the Dog  Racing  Bill,  1928)  was introduced  in the  House of Commons  in  1928, requiring  anygreyhound  track to receive  a  licence from the Local  Authority in whose area it is situated.   This  Bill was  read  a second time butmade no further  progress.  A further Private  Member&apos;s Bill, to achieve  the same object the Dog Racing  (Local  Option)  Bill,1932 was introduced in November, 1932,  was read a second time,and has been referred to a Standing Committee.  41.  The first totalisator to be installed in this country on a grey-hound track was  set up at  Carntyne, Glasgow,  in the  autumn of1929.   The  totalisator at Stanley Park, Liverpool, was set up inMarch, 1930.   Most of the development in regard to the erection of totalisators on  greyhound tracks has taken place within the last18 months  or so.  42.  The introduction  of the totalisator gave a powerful impetusto the development of the greyhound racing industry since it offered a new and  lucrative source of profit to existing tracks and gave astrong incentive to  the creation of fresh tracks.   This is evidencedby the fact that some tracks lowered their prices  of admission andsome  granted free  admission, with  the  object  of increasing thevolume  of   betting  on  the  totalisator.    Many   undertakingsundoubtedly  depend for their existence upon the profits  derivedfrom the totalisator.  43.  Further, the  introduction  of a totalisator  by providing analternative  form  of betting,  facilitated the  imposition by  trackowners of  large levies  on bookmakers.   We were indeed told  inevidence  by  the National  Greyhound  Racing  Society that the managements of the tracks licensed by them  had  no concern withbookmakers who were regarded by  them as members of the public.The fact remains,  however,  that  in many  cases bookmakers  arerequired to pay special fees amounting in some cases to 10s. or  1 a night before they can ply their business on greyhound tracks.  Some-times these fees  are payable, in  whole or in part, for a bettingcard or other betting accessory.  There is often some obscurity  asto the identity of the bodies to whom these fees are  payable.  But
we see no reason to doubt that a substantial income from these feesultimately  accrues to the companies concerned.  The number of tracks  on which  totalisators were operating 0or about 10th December,  1932, was approximately 130.  In  some cases  the totalisators  are  worked by the  companiesowning  the  track,  and  in  others  under an agreement  by anoperating company.  44. The National Greyhound  Racing Society have instituted asystem  of  control  over  totalisators on affiliated tracks.  The  con-trol  is  exercised by  a &quot; Greyhound Racing Totalisator  control board &quot; which commenced to function on 1st October, 1931.   Nototalisator may be operated on a licensed course without a certificate of approval  from  this  Board.   Standing orders and  regulationshave been laid down governing such points as the deduction allow-able (10 per cent, and breakages), approval of the  type of totalisatoroperated, inspection and  examination of totalisator operations and accounts by  the Board&apos;s official inspectors, and the like, a firm ofchartered accountants being  appointed to act as the Board&apos;s in-spectors in this matter.  No betting is allowed on  the  totalisator with persons under 17years of age.  In this, and certain other respects, the Society havemodelled their control on that exercised by the Racecourse BettingControl Board.  The difference remains that totalisators  on grey-hound tracks are commercial concerns.  45. The National Greyhound Racing Society in evidence beforeus stated that they had done their utmost to provide  satisfactorycontrol over  the  totalisators on  affiliated tracks,  and that  they believed that control  to be  effective in  preventing  irregularitiesand fraud upon the public.  Nevertheless they had reached the con-clusion that  it was desirable that a statutory body should be setup for  the control of all betting operations on greyhound tracks ;and  that no  totalisator  or pari-mutuel should be legal except thoseapproved by  the  proposed statutory body or by the  racecourse betting Control Board.  46. On  unlicensed tracks no such system  of  control has  been instituted, although we were informed by the British  GreyhoundTracks Control Society  that  all the totalisators on their tracksare  required to  be under the control of independent charteredaccountants.  Some of the tracks within  the scope of this Societymake a deduction of 5 per cent, instead of the  usual 10  per  cent.The British  Greyhound Tracks Control Society claimed that if any measure of control of betting in greyhound tracks  were to be recom-mended,  they  should  receive comparable  recognition with  theNational Greyhound  Racing Society and Club.Horse racecourses for night-racing.   47.  There is a track,  equipped with a totalisator, near  Edinburgh.on which  dog racing takes place on certain  days in the week and
pony racing on others.   This track has not  been approved by theRacecourse Betting  Control  Board.0We heard  evidence from the Chairman of Northolt  Park Race-course  Limited, where  races are run under  the  rules of the PonyTurf Club.    This  racecourse  was approved by  the  racecourse betting Control Board in May, 1930, but the company is at presentoperating a  totalisator  independently  of  the Board.    We  were informed  that  a  proposal  was on  foot to introduce flood lightingand to have  frequent race meetings by night.  48. Accounts have appeared in the Press of proposals to promotetwo arenas for horse racing  by night, on the outskirts  of London;at Park Royal  and at Chadwell Heath.   We have  had  no evidence from the promoters of these two  enterprises, but we  understandthat they are outside the scope of the  recognised authorities forthe control  of  horse racing.   It was  stated in  the Press that  inthe latter case it was proposed to  install  a totalisator  and to havemeetings every week night.  The former  proposal  was stated to be part of a scheme for the formation of a night racing association (topromote horse  racing at night in  and around London.  49. The attempt to promote pony  racing or  horse  racing  onthe lines indicated above, is a recent development, which has not,up  to  the present,  gone very far.  We regard  this development,however, as  significant, since it shows  the type of  enterprise whichwould  be likely  to  be  promoted in increasing numbers if anyone who so  desired  could  operate  a  totalisator.  We think that  thetotalisator would tend  to  become the predominant feature in suchenterprises,  and that less and less interest would attach  to  the merits of the sport as an entertainment. Tote Clubs.   50. As stated  in paragraph 22, a  sports club  had operated a totalisator on  a  credit basis for the benefit of  its members since 1922.    After  the decisions  already referred to in favour of the legality of  the  totalisators  set up on greyhound tracks, various enterprises were established to exploit the operation of totalisators away from the course.   51.  The pioneer in this field, as well as the largest  undertaking, would  appear  to be Pool (Tote)  Clubs Limited.  This company, in  October,  1931, established a chain  of six  clubs in London which was later increased to 32.  Membership of this  chain of clubs costs Is. a year.  The total membership has  grown to  over 32,000, and every  member on production of his  card of membership has  the right of entry to every club in the chain.  It is claimed that &quot;  full club facilities  &quot;  are provided, but it will not be disputed that  the clubs  exist by virtue of the betting facilities afforded.  Betting is carried  on every afternoon during racing  hours,  on horse races, and in some  cases  also  during the evening on  greyhound races.
Until the recent decision  in the Leeds case,  betting  was on a ready money basis.   The  amount  of the money  staked  in  eachclub  on  each  horse  is  communicated  by  telephone  to  tiiheadquarters of  the organisation, and totalled in two pools.  Thedividend in each  pool is  ascertained  at  headquarters  and  com-municated  by telephone to the individual clubs.  The deductionmade is the usual  10 per cent, plus  breakages.  The minimumbet is 2s.  This particular organisation would seem  to  be carriedon in an orderly and businesslike manner.  52. Of recent months a  large number of tote clubs  have  beenestablished, as individual ventures,  or  as  part  of  more ambitiousschemes, in most  of  the large  centres  of population in Englandand  Scotland.  Approximately 284  tote  clubs were known to be in existence on10th December, 1932, and G6  more were  reported to be about to open.  The dates on  which these 284 clubs  were first opened is shownin the following  table.    In existence  before end of 1931    ...    ...     ...      9    Opened during first six months of 1932   ...     ...     16    Opened during July, 1932   ............     20    Opened during August, 1932 ............     16    Opened during September,  1932    ...    ...     ...     33    Opened during October, 1932      ...    ...     ...     42    Opened during November,  1932    .........     87    Opened during first 10 days of December, 1932    ...     61Total..................   284  53. These establishments cater for different classes of the  com-munity.  For example, we had evidence from one witness repre-senting a club which was  &quot; intended  for  those  members of thepublic who are usually to be found in ordinary social clubs of thehigher grade.&quot;  In this case the subscription was 5s. a year.  Theclub had existed for some years as a social  club, but the member-ship had increased definitely  since the  introduction of totalisatorbetting.  54. On the other hand  there are  clubs where the subscriptionis Id. a year,  and  where the formalities for  election (which it maybe remarked,  appear to  be extremely expeditious in regard to allthese  clubs)  are   reduced to  vanishing point.   We  quote  inAppendix III the  description  of a tote club at Paisley.  Many  of the tote clubs sell intoxicating liquor.  This is true of8 of the 32  clubs  belonging to Pool  (Tote)  Clubs Limited, and of103 out of 145 clubs  in the Metropolitan area.  55. The Chairman of Pool  (Tovc) Clubs  Limited in  evidence before us, gave it as his opinion that &quot; the creation of alternative or
additional facilities for betting cannot, and in fact, does not, increasethe amount available or the number  of bettors to any large extent.UL  simply means a  redistribution of the bets.&quot;  In  his  view oneeuect of tote clubs would be to &quot; remove street bookmakers almost wholly from the streets &quot; and  would  provide  &quot; better and fairerfacilities  to the ordinary  man who is not in a position to indulge in  credit  betting.&quot;   While he  regarded control of  tote  clubs  as desirable he did not regard legislative control as necessary; but  hewas  prepared to see  these clubs made  a source  of  revenue for theState.  56. A witness representing another tote club suggested that toteclubs should be allowed to continue  under licence  from the Race-course Betting  Control Board, such  licence to be  dependent uponthe  money  staked  in the  licensed clubs being passed  to thelotalisators on  race courses operated  by that Board.           GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS.  57. In  paragraphs 22-32 we  have drawn attention to  the legaldecisions in regard  to totalisator transactions.   It will be seen that so  far as  England  is concerned totalisator transactions in certaincircumstances  at any rate have been  regarded  as covered by theprovisions of the Betting Act,  1853.  In Scotland they  have not hitherto been so regarded.  These difficulties would never  have arisen but for the recent dis-covery that, in law,  transactions on  a totalisator were  not betswith the operator of  the totalisator and that there was an apparentgap  in the law against betting with persons resorting.  In our view  these transactions are  in substance  betting trans-actions and there is no justification for treating  them as exempt from any of the restrictions  or  prohibitions  which the State may find it necessary to impose upon betting transactions generally.  58. Before setting out  our  specific recommendations, it is neces-sary, therefore, to  indicate in  outline some of the  general con-siderations  which  in our view should  underlie  legislation  as  tobetting and  gambling, and  certain  considerations  which apply  inparticular to totalisator operations.  The general object at which the State should aim may be statedas being  to  prohibit or place restrictions  upon such facilities  forbetting and  gambling, and  such facilities only, as can  be shown to have serious social consequences  if  not  checked.  In effect thishas  been the main object of earlier legislation on this  subject.  59. In  this connection we would draw particular attention to thefact that earlier legislation  has imposed  limitations and restric-tions on betting where layer and backer resort together, because ofthe  inducements which may  be offered for excessive betting  or  forthe  spread of  the betting habit.  Existing legislation may require modification to meet  modern  conditions;  but we  recognise  the underlying principle.
  60. We  have been impressed  by the spread  of  the organisedfacilities for betting and gambling, and of the habit of betting andgambling.  The weight of  the evidence  shows that  serious socj&amp;lconsequences are ensuing.   The gambling instinct of the populationat large is being  increasingly exploited  by persons for their ownfinancial gain.  61. Regarded from this  point of view,  the totalisator appearsto us to be a grave  danger.   As a method of betting it is easilyunderstood, and its appeal  is  widespread.  Experience has shownthat totalisators,  provided  only  that they can  be  operated con-tinuously on several days a  week in large centres of the population,rapidly attract to  themselves a large volume of betting transactions which  prove  extremely profitable to the  promoters.  This  leads to a rapid increase in the opportunities for organised  betting.  62. This view  is  amply borne  out  by the  facts  set  out inparagraphs 33-56  of this report.   In our view there is an importantdistinction between  the  position of a company  which provides aracecourse or track  where  betting may take  place  among  thosewho attend,  and the position of a company which sets out  to pro-vide a racecourse  or track  with a betting  machine as an integral part of the enterprise, in expectation of deriving commercial profitsfrom the betting transactions.  In the latter case there is a strongpresumption that often  the  provision of  betting facilities is theobject  and the sport  merely the means thereto.  63. Another consideration is that the totalisator is liable to  fraudon the part of those operating it.  The use  of expensive mechanicaltotalisators with fool-proof  devices may minimise this  danger, but cannot remove it  altogether.  The operations have to be conductedat high speed and a large amount of money passes in a short  time.The calculation of the  total pool, of the deduction for the manage-ment,  and of the number of winning tickets, all afford opportunities -ties  for fraud.   The  fraud may be committed by the  management,or by servants of  a management which acts in good faith but doesnot  exercise a  sufficiently  stringent  supervision.    The types offraud to which totalisator  operations lend themselves  are  difficultto detect.  64. We recognise that many totalisators  are run with scrupuloushonesty and under strict supervision and  we do not suggest thatfrauds  are common ;  but it is clear  that  the  possibility of  fraudcould not  be overlooked  in any scheme  of a permanent characterfor permitting the operation of totalisators.  65. We therefore  reach  the conclusion  that,  if and  so far astotalisators where there is resorting might be allowed, it could onlybe under the strict and detailed control  of a Government Depart-ment or a statutory body.  The functions of this body would neces-sarily include determination of the places and the number of occa-sions on which totalisators might be operated.  Its functions would
also  include detailed  supervision of the working  of  the totalisator.In our view this conclusion is fundamental to any consideration ofvV question of  totalisators.  66. This is in conformity with  the  action taken  by Parliamentwhen passing the Racecourse Betting  Act, 1928. Further, in all,or virtually all, of Your Majesty&apos;s Dominions, and Colonies,  andin foreign countries,  the legislatures have enacted that totalisatorsshould only be operated under statutory control  or by licence,  andhave determined the destination, in whole or in part, of the profitsearned.  67. \Ye would add that in our view  a statutory body of the kindreferred to could only be  set up if it could first be  shown that on balance there were  some clear positive advantage to be  gainedin the public interest.  68. The general  considerations  which  we  have  set  forth  fall to be  applied  to totalisators  operated away from  racecourses ortracks (as for example at tote clubs),  and to  those  operated atracecourses  or tracks.Tote  Clubs.  69. We regard totalisator clubs, or  any similar development, asa grave social menace.  We  cannot accept the view referred to inparagraph  55 that these clubs  simply  result in  a redistribution otbets, and do not increase the extent  of betting.   The  weight ofthe evidence is  to the contrary.  While in  some areas these clubsmay  to some extent supplant the  business previously  transactedwith  street bookmakers, we  are  satisfied that, for  the most  part,they  afford  additional facilities for betting,  and serve  to induce the  betting habit in sections of  the community which  would not otherwise acquire the habit.   70.  Further,  tote clubs offer the type of facilities for continuousgambling which has for many years been recognised by  the legis-lature as  increasing appreciably  the  social  evils  resulting  fromgambling.  Having  made a  bet,  a  bettor will naturally  await theresult of the race, and having heard the result he wTill be tempted,if he  has  won, to stake  his winnings on the next race, or  if hehas lost, to try  to  recoup  his losses.  The organisation of  such facilities  on a  credit basis is calculated to heighten the mischiefrather than otherwise.Totalisators on  greyhound racing  tracks.   71. The  general  question of  betting  facilities   on  greyhound tracks, other than by means of the totalisator, is  a matter which we  must defer for our final  report.  But it  is necessary, at this stage, to refer  to the volume of  betting on greyhound tra-cks, and to the circumstances in which it  is carried on.   72. We  have already described the  increase in the  number of these tracks,  an  increase which  is still continuing  without any control.  The  facts  set out  in paragraphs 35-38 shown that owing to the situation of the tracks in  or near densely populated areas,
the frequency of the meetings and the succession of races at shortintervals,  the development of greyhound  racing  has resulted  inan enormous increase  in  the facilities for continuous betting of0character similar to that to which we refer in paragraph 70.  Theevidence shows that  the social consequences are serious.  We have indicated the  part which the  totalisator, as a source ofcommercial  profit  to the promoters of the tracks,  has  played  inthis development.  73. It has  bee*n contended that if  totalisator transactions are per-mitted on  horse racecourses, there is no  substantial reason why they should not be allowed on greyhound tracks.   We have referred in paragraph 45 to the suggestion  made by the National greyhound racing Society that  a statutory body,  similar  to, but separate from,  the  Racecourse  Betting  Control  Board,  should be  set  upto control all betting operations on  greyhound tracks.  We  think  that there are fundamental  differences between horseracing and greyhound  racing which cannot be disregarded.  74. In the first jjlace we would refer to the facts summarised inparagraph 72 as to the facilities for on the course betting at grey-hound  tracks.  These  facilities are  much greater in the aggregatethan those afforded at  horse racecourses.  75. Secondly, Parliament only  approved  the  operation  of thetotalisator on horse racecourses, subject to the funds derived there-from being devoted for &quot;  purposes conducive to the improvement ofbreeds of horses or the sport of horse racing.&quot; Horse racing is notonly a very old established institution in the  country, but it is closely connected  with the horse  breeding industry  which  is a nationalindustry of some importance.  In our view there is no object con-nected with  greyhound racing which would be a proper destinationfor funds earned by  totalisators under the supervision of a statutorybody set up  by Parliament.  We  have  considered the further question  whether a  statutorybody should  be set up to control  and operate totalisators on grey-hound tracks, either without profit, or with the provision that the resulting profit  should be devoted  to the State or to some objector objects quite unconnected  with greyhound  racing.  There  isno reason in the public interest why such a board should be  set up.and  in view  of the considerations set out in paragraph  72 we con-sider it definitely undesirable that such a step should be taken.  We would add that  if a supervisory board were to be granted forbetting on greyhound  tracks, it is difficult  to see on  what groundsit could be refused to  any other type of contest which lent itself  tobetting and  in connection  with which it was desired to establishtotalisators.Horse  Racecourses.   76. It may be  noted  that there is nothing in  the  racecourse betting Act, 1928, to prevent the Racecourse Betting Control Board
                              17from  authorising the operation  of  totalisators on  horse  or  ponynacks in  urban areas  by night  on several  days  per  week.   Wefonsider that the  operation of totalisators in such circumstances should not be allowed,  and we shall deal with this matter in our final report.                       RECOMMENDATION.  77. During the last two or more years, advantage has been taken of an uncertainty in  the law to carry on totalisator betting in  clubsand on greyhound tracks.    In our view totalisator betting in  these places should be brought to an end as soon as possible.  We are aware that some dislocation or loss may follow from the cessation of totalisator operations in tote clubs and on greyhoundtracks, but we cannot regard this as outweighing the considerationson which  our conclusions are  based.  78. Our recommendation, therefore, is  that the conduct in anyplace of totalisator betting  with  persons resorting thereto, whether on a  credit or  cash  basis,  should be declared illegal  in  Englandand Scotland, save as provided  by the Racecourse Betting Act,  1928.  Totalisator betting in other circumstances than those  referredto in this  paragraph, is a  matter which we reserve  for our final report...

                            APPENDIX  III.-9             Description  of a Totalisator  Club at Paisley.(Extracts  from case  stated for the opinion of the  High Court of Justiciary                             at Edinburgh.)  Tlio promises libelled consist of a basement lint at 28, High Street, Paisley.Tbo  basement  is 47 ft.  6  in. Jong by 32 ft.  7 in. to 36  ft.  11 in. broad,with two  passages to the North on  the East and  West sides measuring33 ft.  2 in.  by 11 ft. 6 in. and  27  ft. G in.  by  11  ft. 5 in.  respectively,and  the whole basement is 7 ft.  0 in. high, -with  a lavatory at the  SouthEast corner  and  a  Bar at  the South  West corner.  The entire  premises are under the street level and are entirely without  daylight.  The  said premises  wore  under  observation by the police for a period of four days  from  12th to 15th  of  July,  1932, inclusive.    Large  numbersof men frequented  the  premises,  mainly after 7.130 p.m., at which  hourdog-racing begins.  On 12th  July, between 8 p.m.  and 9.45 p.m., 395 people were  observed  to  come out  and  186 to   enter.  146  people came  outcontinuously  between 9.36  p.m.  and  9.50   p.m.   On 13th   July,  between7.10  p.m.  and  9.45  p.m., 393  people entered  and 44S  people came out.Between 9.37 p.m. and  9.15 p.m., 189 people camo  out continuously.  On14th July, ibetween 7.30  p.m. and 10 p.m., 502 people entered and  473 came out.   On  loth  July,  the night  of the raid,  between 7.20 p.m.  and 8 p.m.,305 people entered and  52 people came out.  The  premises were open from 10 a.m.  till 10 p.m. and members during these hours frequented the premises;  they were furnished with nine  forms,capable of seating 50 or 60  people, one small table and a totalisator. Thetotalisator was of the usual type.  It had six windows to the front, numbered1 to 6  inclusive.  On a  notice-board  was  posted the names and numbers ofthe dogs running in the next race.  The bets were Is. each.  Anyone desiringto bet  on a particular  dog  paid in  Is.  at the window with  the numbercorresponding to the number of the dog, and received in exchange a cardor ticket  giving  the number of  the dog and the nature of  the bet.   Aperson  could put on  more bets than one.  An apparatus over each windowshowed the number of bets on each dog,  and on each bet being put on thenumber was increased accordingly.  At the  time the police  officers visited the premises the totalisator was  in  operation at five of the windows,  andwas  being used for  betting  on  dog races at the Albion Greyhound RacingTrack,  Glasgow.  There  were at the time of the raid 175 bets on  the racethen about to be run.   The  result of each race was received by  telephonesituated outside, a messenger bringing in the results of the  races.  All themoney  staked  on each  race, less  10  per cent, retained  by  the tenant ormanager  of  the premises, was then  divided equally among  tho  holders oftickets  bearing the  number  of  the winning dog.   The winnings  were paid out at  a window at the  right-hand side of the totalisator, the front windowsbeing then open for bets on  the next  race.  On a  notice-hoard in the centre of the  front of the  totalisator  was displayed the  name of the  winning dogin the  previous  race and the sum payable to  each of the successful  ticket-holders.  No games of  any  kind  were being  played  at the time the policeentered the premises.  While it was  represented that the  premises were  used by a club called&quot; The  Paisley  Toto  Club &quot;, the rules of which  were produced  and borethat  the  club was for  the  purpose  of providing recreation  rooms  and  a convenient meeting-place for members  and generally to encourage social inter-course  and rational  recreation,  no furnishings such as are usual in a socialclub were found on  tho premises and there was no  provision for games  ofany kind.

Various,,newspapers (morning and evening)  were  provided for members, and boxingexhibitions given to the  members.  At tho timo  of the raid no newspaperswere found  in  the  Club.  In  the  bar, mineral waters, cakes and  cigaretteswere sold.  Tho  membership  subscription was Id.
