THE SITUATION IN INDIA.       MEMORANDUM BY THE  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.   I circulate for the consideration of my colleagues some papers in  regard  to the-political situation in India.  It  will be seen that this correspondence arose out of asuggestion which I made to the Viceroy that it might be opportune to allow Sir TejBahadur Sapru  and Mr.  Jayakar on their return to India to see Mr. Gandhi  andacquaint him with their  views as  to the upshot of the Round Table  Conference.I had gathered that they would press  to be allowed  to do  so,  and  I thought that  ifsuch a request were made and  it was clear that no negotiations  were intended weshould put ourselves in the wrong  if  we refused.  But Sir Tej  Bahadur Sapru  andMr. Jayakar seem, on mature consideration, not to have put this request forward ontheir return to India.   There can he no question, of course, of our suggesting to themthat they should go to  see  Mr. Gandhi, and this particular question is therefore  inthe background, at any  rate for the  present.   But these papers also raise  the  more general question  of our policy in regard  toMr. Gandhi and  the  civil disobedience prisoners.  Should we be  justified, either  inthe hope of getting Congress collaboration in the framing of the new Constitution andwider acceptance of it when it is finished, or for more general reasons, in adopting amore conciliatory policy towards them ?  The  replies of  the Governors  do not dealwith this problem, which, indeed, had not been  referred to  them, but I have includedtheir replies as they contain  some useful material.   On the other hand, the valuable and important note by Sir H. G. Haig, the Home  Member  of the Viceroy&apos;s Council,deals mainly with the broader question,  and it is this  to  which I invite the special attention of my colleagues.    Let me say at once that I agree  with a great deal  of this note.   There can  be noquestion of a negotiation as  to the terms  on which  the civil disobedience prisonerswould recover their liberty.   This has been tried once and it was worth trying, butwe cannot do it a second  time.   If the  Congress  calls  off  civil disobedience thenon-violent prisoners will be released  unconditionally and this is perfectly well known.The only other alternative is an act  of grace on our part.  Sir II. G. Haig is strongly opposed to an act of grace amounting  to a spectacular gaol delivery and I agree withhim on this.  I agree further that there are certain  individuals who could not  in any event be released at present.  I am  not sure, however, that  we have no alternative butto let the  policy  of  the last  twelve months take  its  course and that there is norelaxation  of the present regime which could be safely undertaken.  I  shall developmy views in detail when the subject is discussed in the Cabinet.     INDIA  OFFICE,                                                       S. H.             February  1933.                 Telegram from Viceroy, dated 25th December 1932,   195  C.   Private and  personal.  Your private and personal telegram dated 24thDecember,  3321.   1  am strongly  of  opinion  that decision  regarding Sapru  andJayakar being allowed to interview Gandhi should  be  deferred until they return toIndia and see me.   Interview  will undoubtedly be regarded in India as initiatingnegotiation, no matter what reasons are given, especially if formal announcement ismade by you.  Announcement two weeks before the interview takes place would leadto renewed agitation in the interval for Gandhi&apos;s release and consequent decrease inrecovery of confidence amongst  all tbe services, which  has been a most  valuableresult of our mutual policy.  Postponement of decision will enable me to consult mycolleagues  and  also Provincial  Governors,  to  which  I  attach  great  importance.     1CG2   60  2.33                                                       A    [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.!

Situation  is complicated  by Gandhi&apos;s  threatened  fast on  2nd  January,  which  if carried into effect, might result in his unconditional release.   Even if interview shouldsubsequently be allowed, I consider that there is nothing to be gained by advertisingit in advance.   I have consulted  Anderson and  Commander-in-Chief, who fully agree with views expressed above.       Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated 29th December 1932.   33-15.   Private   and  personal.   Your  private  and  personal telegram dated25th December, 195  0.  I am  soriy I  did not make  it plain in  my telegram of  the2-lth  December that  1  had no  intention of  making any announcement in advance of the  return of Sapru and  Jayalcar, nor did  1 mean to imply that permission should come from me rather than from you.   All  that I wanted was to  have your views to guide me in dealing  with  them if they raised the question.   In point of fact, they  didnot raise it directly.  They pressed, however, for release of Gandhi, without conditions-,and  also of civil disobedience prisoners  as  soon as possible, and in any case before publication of  White Paper.  They argued  that, without this,  prospect of all-roundco-operation in next stage of reforms would be seriously impaired.   1, of course, gave them no encouragement whatever in this regard, and story in Herald of to-day has nota shadow of  foundation.  I suspect F. W.  Wilson is behind it.   He  saw Sapru atVictoria and is no doubt embroidering  upon the fact that Sapru and Jayakar had justseen me.   I will  await your further communication on the question of  Sapru and  Jayakarbeing allowed to see  Gandhi.  I am alive to the clangers of  public  misunderstanding of what the interview would mean, but trust they could be  overcome as I attach real importance to Sapru and Jayakar  having the opportunity of  conveying to Gandhitheir impression of position resulting from last Round Table Conference.   It would be well if we  could  reach  agreement in time to allow a message  to reachSapru on arrival at  Bombay.   I believe Sapru intends to go up  to Delhi soon afterreturn.                 Telegram from Viceroy, dated 7th January 1933.   26 C.   Private and  personal.  Your private and personal  telegram dated 29thDecember, 33-15.  1 have  consulted Governors on  the suggestion  contained in jrourtelegram ol 2-ith December, that Sapru and  Jayakar  on return  should  be allowed tosee Gandhi and explain to  him the results of the Round Table  Conference and amsending you their replies by air mail.   They agree generally with the views expressedin my telegram of 25th December.  I am also  sending a  minute  record by my HomeMember  which deals generally with the policy to be followed  in regard to gandhi and  Congress.   Both  I and my Council are in full general agreement with ilaig&apos;views.   2. We recognise that chief object of such an interview would  be to show that weare not unreasonable, and that we are giving Gandhi and Congress  every opportunityfor co-operating in the new Constitution, hut we are of opinion that such an interviewcould not fail to have  very intrenching results, and would tend to destroy the favourable position which  we have  achieved partly by the\ consistent policy followed  during thelast year and partly  by  the success of the last Round Table Conference.  Our main reasons are as follows :        (a)  Gandhi, though at present immersed in his untouchability campaign,  has     shown no  sign  of  modifying his political views and made this fact clear in his     leiter to Saukey.  Nationalist papers have not accepted the  result of the Round     Table Conference and have made it clear that a geueral amnesty alone would  not     satisfy them, but that it must be accompanied by constitutional  proposals acceptable     to Congress.       (6)  If Sapru and Jayakar went to see Gandhi we see  not  the least  reason to     anticipate that  he  would or could change his attitude on the  basis of proposals     that bear little relation to Congress demands, and he is not in a position to move     by himself.  He would  be likely to adopt the same line as he did  in July 1930,     when Sapru and Jayakar intervened as mediators.  Then, as now, object was to
    secure a favourable atmosphere and co-operation of Gandhi and Congress.  Those    negotiations failed, for though Gandhi  at first appeared  not wholly unreasonable,    he protested his inability to decide anything without consulting the Nehrus and    others.  This was allowed and  his attitude at once stiffened and he supported    their  impossible  demands.   We see  no reason  to  anticipate any other result    now.   The refusal of a demand  to consult other Congress  leaders would expose    Government to  more criticism  than refusal to modify  their present policy by    allowing Gandhi an interview on political  matters with Sapru.  If Gandhi was    allowed to see other leaders, it would  tend to upset all  the work done  by those    who have  co-operated  during tho last two years  and to  damage  the results    achieved by the last Round Table Conference.      (c)  Congress is in a definitely  less favourable position than  in 1930 and has lost    its hold on the public.  If Congress recovers its  position, or even if  any action    such as proposed interview is taken which conveys the  impression that Govern-    ment  are trying  to  win over  Congress  to  co-operate,  it  will  have a  most    disheartening  effect on the more moderate elements, who, under present conditions,    will, it is hoped, be able to assert themselves at first election and  to give  new    constitution a fair start.  Already in  at  least two  provinces, United Provinces    and Bihar and Orissa, such parties are being formed but they are not j-et stable,    and, if Congress is restored to  credit, these newly  formed parties  would fail,    Congress would again become predominant and would  be  put back in a position    to neutralise  the safeguards so  elaborately  worked out at the Round Table    Conference, to dictate their  own  terms, and  wreck the  uew  constitution.   It is    true that they might not be able or willing to  adopt  any form of direct action or    to seek to  revive civil disobedience when Local  Governments have powers to    fight it, but they would adopt the more insidious methods used after the pact in    1931 and by this means re-establish a commanding position.   3. The main justification for the proposed interview is that  there  is a hope that ghandi, and, through him, Congress  generally, would change  their attitude on thebasis of the Round Table Conference proposals, but of this there appears to us not theleast probability.  If, on the other hand, we continue  our present policy  of pushingreforms and of refraining-  from anything in the nature of negotiations with Congressthere is every chance of the more moderate elements in Congress gradually dissociatingthemselves from extremists and making every  effort to secure a position under thenew Constitution.   They  would probably be strong but not overwhelmingly so, andmight tend to amalgamate with Liberals to form a party prepared to work Constitution^not to wreck it.   4. Sykes has suggested that Sapru and  Jayakar might be allowed to visit Gandhipurely in  their private capacity, but  should be told that they are  not entitled to bring back any demands or proposals from him or to publish anything  whatever about theirinterview.   We think that this  is a  position which, in practice, it  would be verydifficult to maintain.    5. I shall, of course, be glad to see  Sapru and  Jayakar on  their return and shallexplain fully our  position, and  1 trust that they  will recognise that it  is better tosecure general  support for achievement of Round Table Conference, and to try quietlyto convert those who are at  present  directing Congress from outside jails, than to repeat attempt of 1930 with similar results.  There is, hovvevei-, force in the view putforward by Hailey, who had not seen your  telegram of the 29th ultimo, that they donot desire reconciliation between Congress  and the Government so much as to gainfor Liberals credit of having put au  end to the policy of repression.    6. In  your telegram  of 29th December you explained that  Sapru and Jayakarpressed for unconditional release of Gandhi and all civil disobedience prisoners before publication of White Paper.  I feel very strongly there must be no encouragement tosuch ideas, that it would  put Congress in a position to reopen  all questions settled atthe last Round Table Conference;  and would destroy the results of  the admirablework you have been  able to achieve  in London.   We can justify our  position  before the public by reiterating point which we  have always made clear, that it is open to ghandi  and  other Congress leaders to take part in constitutional discussions byrepudiating and giving up civil disobedience.
                    Letter from Viceroy, dated 7th January 1933. My dear Hoare,       With reference to my private and personal telegram No. 26 0. of to-day&apos;s date, I  enclose  herewith copies of the replies  from Governors and also  of Ilaig&apos;s note regarding  the question of whether Sapru and Jayakar should be allowed to see Gandhi on their return to India in order to explain to  him  the  results of the Round Table Conference.                                                           Yours sincerely,    The Right Hon&apos;ble Sir Samuel Hoare, Bart.,                      WiiLTNonox              G.B.E., C.M.G., M.P.                              Note by Sir H. G-. Haig.    The Secretary of State  in his  final speech  at the Round  Table Conference has promised his full consideration to the words of  Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, that is, to his appeal to release Mr. Gandhi and other political prisoners.  He  has also  urged  in  a private and personal telegram that Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru aud  Mr.  Jayakar should  be allowed to sec Mr. Gandhi on their return  to India  and explain to him the results of the Round Table Conference.    2.  There are two phrases in the earlier  correspondence regarding  the suggested release of Mr. Gandhi  which are at the core of the present suggestions.  The first is &quot; co-operation with Congress in the hope of  getting the new constitution launched by agreement,&quot; and the second is &quot;to make use of the better atmosphere.&quot;  If, in fact, it  were necessary to secure the co-operation  of Congress in order that the constitution might be properly launched, or even  if it  were likely  that  by an agreement with Congress the new constitution would be launched in more favourable conditions, then I agree that it would be advisable to use the spirit of peace and  goodwill in which the Conference dispersed for the purpose  of securing  the desired  co-operation.  In my view, however, it is in no way necessary to secure the co-operation of the Congress  in order that the new constitution may be properh- launched, and, in fact, if Government reach  an agreement with the Congress I think conditions would be set up which might in certain Provinces wreck the constitution at the outset.   3.  With regard  to the  first of these propositions, that there  is no necessity  tosecure the co-operation of the Congress, my  view is that the credit of Congress has been severely shaken, and that if it is not restored by our  action the more  moderate elements in the country will stand a reasonable chance of asserting themselves at the first elections.  In two Provinces certainly, the United Provinces and Bihar and Orissa, a great deal of patient work has been carried out with a view to creating a moderate constitutional party which would be able to take otlice after the first elections.   The success of  such parties  is  not  yet  assured, aud depends  to a large  extent on thegeneral political conditions  of the next six months.  Anything that would restore the credit  of the  Congress would almost certainly destroy all  hope of such parties achieving any degree of success.   If, on the other hand, Congress are not helped outof their  present  difficulties it has always  seemed  to me likely that  a  right  wing Congress party will emerge  that will contest the elections and may coalesce with the liberals.   A party of  this  kind would probably be strong, but would not  be  over- whelming,  and,  if  successful at the  elections,  might  be expected  to work the constitution  reasonably.  On  the other hand the remaining extremist  Congress elements  would  not  be powerful  enough to be  a  serious  menace  to  the  now constitution through the weapons of direct  action  o,r obstruction.   I think there are clear signs of such a development already  beginning.   Congress is at a low ebb and despondency is spreading.   As always happens at  such  a time  there are  signs  of disintegration and divided counsels.  If the situation is left to work itself out, I have little doubt myself that by one method or another a large body of the more moderate Congress men will take advantage of the new constitution and will  make every effort to secure  power through  it.  My conclusion  therefore  is that for the purpose  of launching the new constitution it is not necessary to get a declaration of co-operation from the Congress.   4.  But, as I have said, I should  go further.   An agreement now with Congress, or a policy of premature  release of prisoners,  would, I  fear, put the Congress in aposition  of complete  dominance  in  many Provinces, and would enable  them  to neutralise  the safeguards  so  elaborately worked  out on paper  by His  Majesty&apos;s
* By fcho end of December this figure had fallen to 14,815.Government, and, in effect, either to dictate their own terms or wreck the constitution.If the opponents of  Congress are once thoroughly disheartened, as they will  be if government again saves the battered reputation of  Congress, they will never recover,and Congress will be established in unchallenged supremacy.   5. I have argued the case from the point of view of  the probable effect on  thefirst elections  rather  than on  the  basis of the probability  of a  revival of civildisobedience.   A  policy interpreted  as  weak might even  now  stimulate  civildisobedience again in  certain Provinces.   But it  is not  certain that Congress itself would wish to continue it in the face  of past failures and the powers that government now possess.  If Congress prestige  is  restored, I  should  imagine they would try tobuild up their  position by  the  methods  used successfully in  1931  after the Pactrather than by provocative defiance of the law.  Any idea, however, that it would bepossible to reach a &quot; gentleman&apos;s agreement&quot; with  the Congress I regard as fantastic.   0. If my reading of  the situation is approximately accurate, our policy should beto give  every chance to the moderate  Congress peojde to get out of civil disobedience,which in fact  they are  doing already, but not to  do anything  that would involve ageneral amnesty, the release  of the extremist leaders and  a great revival of Congresspower.   7. If that  is broadly our policy, then  the  question of the  release of Mr. Gandhiresolves itself  into this, whether  he  should  be given a  chance as  a supposedlymoderate person  primarily interested in untouchability, and whether if this is done it would be possible to  avoid before long a general release of all civil disobedienceprisoners.   Some weeks ago it  might have  been supposed that Mr.  Gandhi was prepared to play the part of the social reformer and let his  political side suffer eclipse.We  have had  the advantage, however, of a very frank repudiation of  that idea byMr.  Gandhi himself in the letter he  addressed to Lord Sankey.   Moreover, is itconceivable that Mr. Gandhi could accept release for himself and do nothing to securethe release  of his followers?   As long as civil disobedience is in existence, he cannotdivest himself of his character  as the leader of the movement, and if he failed tosecure  the  release of his followers, or in others words a general amnesty, would henot  be  forced  into  taking action intended to bring him  back into jail once more?Apart from this, it seems to  me that  it would be very difficult to resist the demandfor the  release of Mr. Gandhi&apos;s followers when Mr.  Gandhi himself had been released.I can remember the very scathing criticisms that  were aimed  at the Government ofIndia in 1030, when il. was alleged that  they were taking action against  the smallermen and leaving Mr. Gandhi rmtouched.   If  it is  safe  to release Mr. Gandhi, surelyit is safe to release the thousands of  lesser people  who have gone to jail in obedienceto his policy.   Therefore, I think we must contemplate that if Mr. Gandhi is releasedthe greater part of the 17,000* civil  disobedience prisoners now in jail would have to be released very soon, instead of  coming out of jail in a safe and steady trickle, asthey are doing at present.    8. There would  also be the question of what to do with Abdul Ghaffar Khan  andJawaharlal Nehru.   The Governor  of the North-West Frontier Province, when  thismatter was last  discussed,  anticipated that the release  of  Gandhi  would produce a very strong demand  for the release of Abdul  Ghaffar Khan, and the release of Abdul  Ghaffar Khan, in the opinion of the North-West Frontier Province Government,would be disastrous.  It would almost certainly mean a revival of the trouble in  that Province, which has almost completely died down.   Jawahar Lai is a fanatic.   There are threatening^ of  an attempt to revive a no-rent campaign in the  United Provinces.Jawarhar  Lai  Nehru  is  the author  of that policy and his release would obviously give it a deliuite stimulus.  My conclusion, therefore, would be, both in considerationof Mr. Gandhi&apos;s own  attitude and  probable  behaviour and  in consideration of  the effect of his release on the question of releasing other prisoners, that it would be very unwise to release Mr. Gandhi at present.    9. The  Secretary  of State&apos;s  definite  proposal  does not  involve release, though it Avill  generally be interpreted  in  that sense,   lie has revived  a suggestion  which ho has made  more than once within the last few  months and which the Government of India have  on every occasion resisted.  The  proposal is  that certain  moderate people should be allowed  to interview Mr. Gandhi with a view to persuading  him of the  futility  of  his  persistence  in his attitude.   Sir Tej  Bahadur  Sapru  and
Mr. Jayakar undoubtedly are  from our point of view more  dangerous  than anyhitherto suggested for this  role.   Sapru and Jayakar are the professional mediators,.and they  played precisely this part during the first civil disobedience movementin 1930, with results exceedingly damaging to the credit of Government.  As soon asthe first  crisis  of  that struggle was over  and it was  clear that Government weregetting on  top,  Sapru  and Jayakar appeared  in July  1930  with proposals  formediation.  They were allowed to interview Mr. Gandhi in jail with a view to seeing whether  he  was not prepared  to  call off  the  movement.   Mr. Gandhi  naturallyexplained that  he  could not act alone.   This led  to interviews with the Nehrusand various conclaves of prisoners.  After prolonged  peregrinations, during whicheveryone  waited anxiously for  the decision of the Congress leaders,  Sir Tej BahadurSapru and  Mr. Jayakar finally reported  to  the  Viceroy  the terms  of peace, whichwere  utterly absurd, but in the meantime a great deal of  mischief had been done.Again, at the  conclusion of the first  Round Table  Conference in  January 1931,when the civil  disobedience movement was clearly languishing, Sapru and Jayakarpersuaded the  Government by  exactly the arguments that are being used now,that if the  constitution was to be acceptable the co-operation of Congress must beobtained.  The result was  the Pact, from  which we  should have  learned  certainlessons.   I  am  afraid I anticipate  that if  we repeat  the methods  of  1930-31  wemust expect the  same  results.   Sapru and Jayakar  would  come  away from  the interview saying that Gandhi  was  quite prepared for an honourable peace  if onlyGovernment were prepared to  do this, that  and  the  other,  and  would  allowMr.  Gandhi  to interview his  friends  and  so on.  In other words,  unless  we  areprepared  to  enter into  negotiations, which we are all agreed is out of the question,it would  be, in my opinion, most unwise to allow Sapru and Jayakar to  interviewGandhi.   It  would,  moreover,  be a complete reversal of our  freqitently reiteratedpolicy.   We have resisted all demands for  political conversations, even such as relateto  the  Hindu-Mohammedan question.   If this  concession  is  given to Sapru  andJayakar,  it  would  be impossible to deny  it to others, and we  should  soon  findMr. Gandhi taking a prominent part in  unity conferences  and delivering his opinionson the new constitution.   There is hardly even much plausibility in the suggestion.Mr. Gandhi sees great numbers  of visitors every day.   He is in pretty close  contact with  the Congress  leaders, and  if he wants  to  understand the position and whatpeople think, he can do this without  the assistance of Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru  andMr. Jayakar.  There is, however, one explanation which I fear many might assign tothis permission, and that is that Sapru and  Jayakar  had come with  a message fromHis Majesty&apos;s Government.    10. Indeed, if Mr. Gandhi were to be released, I should prefer that he should be released  as  a pure  act of grace  not preceded L\v these embarrassing conversations.I have, however, already given my reasons above for  the view that his release at  thepresent stage would be unwise and would have far-reaching effects.    11. My geueral conclusion is that we should not now be afraid of our own policyjust as it appears to be succeeding.  We can, in my opinion, do  without  the goodwill of  Congress, and in fact  I  do  not believe for a moment that we shall ever have it,but we cannot afford to do without the confidence of those who have  supported us during the long struggle against the Congress.                                                                   11. G. HAIO.    28th December 1932.                                               \       Telegram from Governor of Madras to Viceroy, dated 29th December 1932.    Your telegram  of  the  28th instant,  204 C.   Have  not  been  able to  consult  colleagues,  but am personally in entire agreement with your telegram 195 0. to  the  Secretary of State.  Am holding Cabinet on  Saturday and will wire  you further then.       Telegram from Governor of Madras to Viceroy, dated 31st December 1932.   My telegram of the 29th instant.  Have mot Executive Council, who are unanimous-in agreement with your telegiam 195 0. to the Secretary of State.
         Letter from Governor  of the Punjab, dated 30th December 1932.My dear Lord Willingdon,       Please  refer to Your Excellency&apos;s telegram 204 C, dated 2Sth December.  entirely agree with Your Excellency in thinking that it would be a  grave mistake to announce now, in advance  of the return of the Round Table  Conference delegates,that Sapru  and Jayakar will be permitted to have an interview with Gandhi.  Sucha  step would  quite unduly and unnecessarily  enhance Gandhi&apos;s prestige  and importance and to that  extent would also  dishearten co-operators, loyalists and theServices by creating an impression  that he and his party are, in  the  view of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, the only elements in  India that count.   Such a  step would bring about quite the wrong tactical position both  from thepoint  of view of Government and  of delegates to the Round Table Conference, otherthan Sapru and Jayakar.  Surely  these delegates  should  be allowed some  adequatetime to explain to the interests and parts of India they represent what they considerthe Round  Table Conference discussions have achieved and to do such propaganda infavour of their own efforts and successes, as  may seem good to them.   If  this breathing space is allowed to  the delegates generally, who, after all, seemclearly entitled to it as co-operators and actual participators in the discussions, a fairfield may be prepared for reasoned criticism approval or disapproval of the resultsof the Round Table  Conference, but if instantly on arrival  Sapru and  Jayakar are permitted to see Gandhi, the latter in  all probability will at once manage to mobilisehis party&apos;s formidable propaganda machinery against accepting any of the RoundTable Conference results, and thus bias the atmosphere against anything  other RoundTable Conference delegates may have to make public in favour of its achievements.   From the  constitutional  point  of view  also, I think it would be only proper forSapru  and  Jayakar to approach Your  Excellency first and let you  know their views as regards  the situation created by the third Hound Table Conference and ask yourpermission  to visit Gandhi and relate their story to him.   I would not object to  their being permitted  eventually to see  Gandhi for thepurpose ; but I would only allow them to do so after  the other delegates had had areasonable  opportunity  to  lay their case  before their own  respective  publics  andpresses.  As persons who are co-operating with His Majesty&apos;s  Government in trying to frame  the  new  constitution they seem  to me clearly  to be  entitled to  this opportunity, while Gandhi as an unrepenting non-co-operator seems  hardly entitled tothe privilege of the earliest inside authentic information!                                                Yours sincerely,                                                        G.  F. DE MoNTMOKENCY.  Telegram from Governor of Bihar and Orissa to Viceroy, dated 31st December 1932.    15 P.S.  Your telegram of the  28th  ultimo,  204 C.  My opinion is that it  is undesirable to recede from the attitude taken in regard to Unity Conference, namely,that Gandhi has outlawed himself from any political discussion.   First, to allow Sapruand Jayakar interview on political  subjects  which was refused to  Unity Conferenceleaders  would   provoke legitimate criticism  of  previous  prohibition and  similarclaims from other side might  be difficult  to refuse.   Secondly, whatever  be form of announcement,  both  Congress and  general public  will  certainly  regard  Sapru asemissary from Government for negotiation.  Thirdly, if interview be allowed, possibleresult  would  be  either disclaimer by  Gandhi of any interest  in  Round   Tablediscussions and rebuff of Sapru and Government,  or alternatively he might pretendto be impressed  but would certainly profess his inability to  decide anything exceptafter  consultation  with  full  Congress Working  Committee.  If  consultation were refused,  he  puts  Government in  the wrong by their  refusal  to respond  to  hisconciliatory  gesture and so causing a stalemate;  while  if consultation  is allowed,we return to position which led to Gandhi-Irwin Pact.  Only advantage of allowinginterview would be courtesy to Sapru and Jajrakar and disadvantages I think outweighthis.  Incidentally, we  bring  Gandhi, now half forgotten, back  to prominence  andshake faith  of  officials  and  loyalists  in  assurance  that we will  have  no furthercompromise  with Congress.
        Telegram from Governor of Bombay to Viceroy, dated 1st January 1933.   187.  Your telegram of the 28th ult., 201 C.  I  am  entirely in agreement withviews  expressed  in  your telegram .195  C.  to  the  Secretary of State and think no&apos;decision should  be made until Sapru and Jayakar  have arrived  in India and have seen you.  This  course  will preclude any  previous  announcement,  which I agreewould  have  been most objectionable  especially  in  view of recent  attempts in congress to inspire  Press to  represent attitude  of Government  as weakening.  Atthe same time postponement of  decision will enable us to see in the meantime whatreactions follow publication of White Paper and  how Sapru and Jayakar define theirown attitude on return to India.   It is undesirable that they should  wait to take theircue  from Gandhi or do  anything which might in  any way create impression  that acceptance of policy of White Paper depends on approval of Gandhi  or Congress.   2. Assuming that other circumstances are favourable at the time we might find itdifficult to justify a refusal to let Sapru and Jayakar see Gandhi and do anything theycan  to  shake his attitude;  and whilst fully recognising the dangers and  ombarrass-ments which would be likely to result, we might be willing to face them in order tomeet criticism at home  and to retain support of Moderate opinion in  India, whichmight be alienated by refusal.   If we decided to do  so, we  could only make it as clear-as possible that they would  be permitted to visit Gandhi  at their own desire and intheir private capacity, and that they would not be entitled to bring back any demandsor proposals  from him  or to  publish  anything  whatever about  interview.  Thechief difficulty anticipated is  that Gandhi,  even  if inclined  to modify his attitude,which  is unlikely, would  not commit  himself without consulting other congress leaders  both inside  and out of jail,  aud might  demand facilities which,  if granted,would soon lead to regular Congress conferences  at Yeravda and by  suggesting that congress were in a position to negotiate with Government would undermine positionwe have so arduously succeeded in establishing.  It would  therefore need  to be made clear before interview that no such developments  could  be allowed  to arise, and thatinterview would relate to Gandhi&apos;s personal attitude only.   3. I  have  discussed  with Sir Ghulam  Husain  and Hudson,  who concur in theabove views.        Telegram from Governor  of Assam to Viceroy, dated 2nd January 1933.   S. 1. Your Excellency&apos;s telegram of 2Sth December, 204 C.  Sapru and Jayakarmay be sincere, but suggested announcement  will be used wholly for propaganda by congress.   It will look like  reopening  negotiations  with Gandhi  under the directauthority of Home Government.   It will unsettle our  genuine supporters here audput fresh heart into many wavering Congress followers.   Gandhi thrives on publicity and this will give it to  him gratuitously.   Aunounce-ment will win over no one.  Let Sapru apply for interview when he arrives in India.          Telegram from Governor, North-West Frontier Province, to  Viceroy,                             dated 31st December 1932.    745 L.   Private and personal.  Your telegram 204 C, 28th December.   I do not.feel that there is any consideration affecting this Province strong  enough to justifyme  in  advising Your Excellency  to refuse Sapru and  Jayakar  permission to seeGandhi.   Only  way in which we must be  affected  here is, I  think, the fact thatinterview would  no doubt tend to strengthen rumours that have  arisen once or twicehere in the last few months to the effect that a^ general amnesty  is imminent.  this argument, however,  applies  to other Provinces as  strong  as,  and  perhaps  more strongly than, to this Province.   We  are, I consider, now in a strong enough positionhere to discount effect of such rumours and  to meet any local reactions that might be caused.   Express Letter from Governor of the Central Provinces to His Excellency the Viceroy,                             dated 29th December 1932.  &apos;   No. P.S. C./258.   Your telegram No. 20-1 C, dated 28th December 1932.   I agree that the decision about the proposed  interview with  Gandhi should  be  made in the light of the situation prevailing when Sapru and Jayakar arrive, and after they have waited  on you.   Not knowing what has  happened at the Pound Table  Conference, nor yet what the attitude of Sapru and Jayakar is,  nor yet what  the situation will be in January  about Gandhi&apos;s fast, it  is  difficult  to give  any opinion on the merits.

    Telegram from Chief Commissioner, Delhi, to Viceroy,  dated 1st January 1933.   Your telegram of the 28th  December, 201 C.  I am  in complete agreement  withview outlined in His  Excellency&apos;s telegram 205 0. of same date to Secretary ofState.  In  my  opinion, if  an interview is  to  be allowed, regarding  advisability ofwhich  I entertain  doubts, it would be  quite  time enough  to  decide  a  fortnighthence when it has been heard what Sapru and Jayakar have to say ; then announcementof sanction should be made by His Excellency the Viceroy and not by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.   Furthermore, the reasons  why Sapru and Jayakar make  the requestand why Viceroy granted permission would have  to be  stated in clearest and mostunmistakable terms if  trust and confidence in servants and supporters of Governmentare to be retained as throughout past year.  By this I mean that Sapru and Jayakarshould be prepared in  some form or other to announce publicly their faith  in sincerity of Government, and their satisfaction with  results of Round  Table Conference.   in short they will  need to make it clear  both to  Government and  to nation that their desire is to convert Gandhi and not to negotiate or to concert plans with him.Telegram from Governor of the United Provinces  to Viceroy, dated 31st December 1932.   Your telegram  of  the  28th instant, 20-1 C.    I  agree entirely with attitude  you have expressed regarding undesirability of any announcement b\&apos; Secretary of Stateregarding grant of interview with Gandhi, which would be misinterpreted as an actionportending opening of negotiations leading up  to amnesty.   Secretary of State mustnot yield to  illusiou caused  by expression of  goodwill  at Round Table Conferencetowards his own attitude and that of British Delegation.   That goodwill may exist inLondon but has not so far reached India.   Nor must he misinterpret Sapru&apos;s attitude.Latter does not  desire reconciliation between Government and Congress  so  much asto gain for Liberals credit of having put an end to polic3r of  repression.  Then again,if any kind of negotiation is desirable, this is clearly not the  moment. If  we desireto bring Congress in to co-operate with constitutional changes now outlined, we must,in the first place, wait  until latter have taken more definite shape by the issue of a white Paper.  Even if Congress leaders accept as satisfactory the attitude  of BritishGovernment as shown by Secretary of State&apos;s speech, they might easily resile againwhen they had to face somewhat unwelcome  details which White Paper is bound to contain.   Secondly, the issue  does not lie with Gandhi himself, but  with  others.Large number of Congressmen now prefer to see Gandhi isolated from public activitybecause  they consider  his recent attacks on orthodoxy to  be  very damaging to them.I would  not approach  Gandhi himself  till I had ascertained  something about attitude which others are likely to adopt, and if Sapru is anxious to help to produce co-operationI would ask him to  get into touch first with those who are now actually directingCongress.            Letter  from Governor of  Bengal, dated  29th December 1932.My dear Willingdon,      Please  refer to your telegram of the 28th  instant, No. 204-6 C, asking my viewson the  issue raised in the  telegraphic  correspondence which  has recently passed between you and  the Secretary of State regarding interviews  for Sir Tej BahadtirSapru and Mr.  Jayakar with Mr. Gandhi.    I entirely agree, if I may say so, with the views expressed in your reply of the25th instant to the Secretary of State.   Nothing should be  done which could givecolour to the suggestion that these or any other gentlemen  who attended the RoundTable Conference   were returning to India in the position of Envoys Extraordinaiyfrom the Secretary of  State to a &quot; rival power.&quot;    Nor, I  think,  is  it  desirable that  the Secretary  of  State should  make  any announcement  on  the matter.  I would  prefer that the Conference delegates shouldbe allowed to return to India and to apply, if they so desired, on  their arrival, and toyourself or  to the Government  of  India, for  permission  to   discuss  things  withMr.  Gandhi.   It would then follow that  any permission accorded would proceed fromthe  Government of India and  this is, ia my opinion, the correct  position.   It is obviously in  the highest degree undesirable that Mr. Gandhi should be resurrected as-a rival authority to the Government of India or yourself, and if Congress co-operation before  the Joint Select Committee can only be obtained at the  expense of puttingMr.  Gandhi in  a position capable  of  being represented  as that  of a  plenipotentiaryfrom a rival authority, I think that co-operation would bo too dearly bought.                                                           Yours,  &amp;c,                                                               JOHN ANDERSON.
