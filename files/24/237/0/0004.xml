THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT  3 printed for the Cabinet.  January 1933.CONFIDENTIAL.Copy No.   49CP.  4 (33).CABINET.THE USE  OF AIRCRAFT IN IRAQ.     I CIRCULATE herewith a despatch from Sir Francis Humphrys on thissubject.  The despatch came  to be  written  because, with  the question of airdisarmament coming up  for  further examination at Geneva, I  felt that theCabinet would  like to have the  views of our Ambassador in Bagdad as to how the discharge of our responsibilities  in that area might be affected.  I ought tomake it plain that the actual  proposal which was communicated to Sir FrancisHumphrys for  his comments was that of the resolution of the 23rd July, viz. :&quot; Air attack against  the  civilian population  shall be absolutely prohibited.&quot;Some of the illustrations which he mentions in his despatch, e.g., the invasion ofIraq&apos;s frontiers by an aggressor or  the  attack on oil-fields  by Kurdish rebels,would not seem to me to involve the  problem  of bombing the civilian populationat all.  But it might be that the most hopeful way out of the difficulty is not to pursue the method of the resolution of the 23rd July, but to press,  following thelines  of  our White  Paper  of  the  17th  November,  for examination at  theConference  of  the principal Air Powers, of  &quot; the entire  abolition, by inter-national agreement, of military and naval machines and all bombing (apart fromthe use of such  machines as are necessary for  police purposes in outlying places),combined with  an effective international control  of  civil aviation.&quot;   I am not,however, attempting to argue the matter  here, but only to  inform the Cabinet ofthe circumstances in which Sir Francis  Humphrys  came  to write  his  veryimpressive despatch.Foreign Office, January 14. 1933.[E 6843/5666/93]        Sir /-&apos;. Humphrys to Sir John Simon. (Received December 28.)(No. 1157.   Secret.)Sir,                                           Bagdad, December  15, 1932.    I HAVE the honour to submit  the following observations in amplificationof  the  views  which  I  expressed  in   my  secret  telegram   No.   356  ofthe 29th November last:      2.  It  has been suggested that air attack against civilian population  shallbe absolutely  prohibited, and  that  it  shall  be  agreed as  between the  highcontracting parties at the Disarmament Conference that all bombardment from(Initialled)J. S.6701  [8099]B
the air shall be abolished, subject to agreement being reached with regard tothe measures to be adopted for the purpose of rendering the observance of this rule effective, and I have been invited to state my views as to the effect which anagreement on these lines will be likely to have on Anglo-Iraqi relations (especiallyin i regard  to  the  necessity,  or  otherwise, for  revising  the  1930 treaty)  and,generally, on the future of Iraq.     3.  The Anglo-Iraqi  Treaty, which was  signed on the 30th June, 1930, andwhich came into force on the admission of Iraq  to membership of  the Leagueof Nations on the 3rd October, 1932, is  essentially a  treaty of alliance.  It was felt  at the time, when the treaty was being negotiated, that the young State ofIraq, with a population of barely 3 millions, with land  frontiers extending to.1.600 miles, and an army of only 10,000 men, could not be expected to  standalone during  the first twenty-live  years of  its existence.  The Council of theLeague, in its session on the 4th September, 1931, adopted  a resolution confirmingthe report of  the Permanent Mandates  Commission,  that one of  the conditionswhich must be fulfilled before a mandated territory could be released from themandatory regime, was that  it must be capable  of maintaining its territorial integrity  and political independence.   The  view expressed by the  permanent mandates Commission last year was that Iraq would be  unable for  many years to fulfil this  condition without the assistance of a defensive alliance with  aGreat Power, and this opinion  will  be  endorsed by every unprejudiced person,cither inside or outside Iraq, who is acquainted with  the facts of the situation.In other words, without the British alliance  there is no  doubt that  Iraq wouldbe still under mandate.     4.  It has been recognised from the beginning in London that  a defensivealliance with Iraq would be dangerous, if  not an impracticable commitment,unless a skeleton British air force were maintained in the country  throughoutthe period of the alliance.  This attitude was fully explained by me at Genevaduring my  examination before  the  Permanent Mandates  Commission  inNovember  1931.   My evidence  on  that  occasion  contained  the following statement :          &quot; Owing  to the  remote  geographical  position of Iraq,  which  was     practically landlocked, the  retention of a skeleton British air force in the     country was  essential in order  to enable  His Majesty&apos;s Government to     discharge the obligations of their alliance.  Air reinforcements could not be     sent to Iraq in  case of need unless  there was some nucleus of a British air     force and aerodrome  organisation on the  spot to receive them.  Stores, spare     parts, repairing workshops. &amp;c, would  have to be  maintained and,  apart     from this, it would clearly be impossible for air reinforcements to set out     for Iraq  without the assurance that they could land at aerodromes  there in     safety.  Reinforcements could not reach Iraq by sea, that is  to  say, via     the Persian Gulf and Basrah, in time to be  effective.&quot;     5.  One of the objects which the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930 was designedto secure was the defence of Iraq from external aggression; the other principalobject was &quot; the permanent maintenance and protection  in  all circumstances ofthe  essential communications of His Britannic Majesty.&quot; During the course ofthe  negotiations for the treaty, which I conducted myself with King Feisal andhis Ministers, it became abundantly clear that the Iraqi Government would neverconsent to the location of Imperial land forces in Iraq,  except for  the purposeRoyal Air Force in an emergency.  So strong was the feeling on this point thatNuri  Pasha  informed me that the treaty would not  be  ratified  by  the IraqiParliament unless it was made clear that the word  &quot; forces &quot; used in article 5of the treaty referred exclusively to air forces.  Accordingly, I was instructed by  His Majesty&apos;s Government to write to the Iraqi Prime Minister  on the15th July, 1930, to the following effect :-         &quot; The forces which His Britannic Majesty is authorised to  maintain    in Iraq in accordance with the terms of article 5  of the treaty shall comprise    Royal Air Force units, together with  ancillary services.&quot;An exception was made in case of emergency, when the two high contractingparties  agreed that the  special Iraqi guards  were inadequate for the defenceof His Britannic Majesty s air bases in Iraq.of repelling an immediateprotecting  the
    6.  Although I  have not  had the  opportunity  of checking  the figures-accurately. I  understand that the present &quot;additional&quot; cost  of maintainingRoyal Air Force units in this country under the terms of the treaty,  includingthe cost&quot; of the Air Defence Force, will amount to about  360,000 a year, whereas the &quot;additional&quot; cost of maintaining  land forces in lieu of air forces wouldbe at least ten times greater, even if it were possible in the changed conditions to obtain Indian battalions from the Government of India.  I take it for granted that no British  Government  would be prepared  to incur  the  additional  cost involved by the substitution of land for air forces as the Imperial garrison inIraq in time of peace, even if the Iraqi  Government could be persuaded to agreeto such an arrangement.    7.  I now venture on to ground which is technically outside my province.I am not- aware of these scheme (presumably under consideration by the Committeeof Imperial Defence), which indicates the aid to be furnished by Great britain in the capacity of an ally, should Iraq  become engaged in war.   Presumablysuch a war would be brought about by an invasion of the country by Turkey,Persia or Saudiyah Arabia.   I  have always assumed that British  assistance inthe event  of a threat  of such an invasion  would be confined to air action in the mountain passes to the north or east, or in  the desert to the  south or  west.  In1924, when Turkish troops invaded Iraqi territory as far as Rawanduz,  theywere  successfully bombed out  of the country in a  comparatively short time andat very small cost, without any declaration of war.   Any other method of dealingwith  this incursion would have  entailed enormous expenditure and  a seriousaggravation of  the tension which then prevailed between Great  Britain and turkey.   It seems not unreasonable to hope that a Turkish or Persian advancemight be  held.up in  the early  stages by intensive bombing  operations by theRoyal Air Force, while the League machinery was  being set in motion at Genevafor putting an end to hostilities.  It  should  not be  difficult to reinforce theRoyal Air Force in this country from Egypt and Transjordan in order that air action of this nature might be rendered  effective;, and the land and  air forcesof Iraq would be trained  by  the  British military mission to co-operate to thebest  of  their  ability in the  operations.   The landing  of  British or indian divisions, however, to take part in the defence of Iraq,  seems  to me  to be outof the question, both on account of the enormous expense to the British Treasurywhich would be involved, and because they could  not arrive in  time to preventthe occupation by enemy forces of the principal strategic points.  I am  not awarewhat action could be taken in regions  outside  Iraq and its immediate bordersto check a Turkish invasion, but it is clear that the occupation of a vital strategicpoint like Mosul, in  the early days of the campaign, would produce a highly dangerous effect  on the internal stability of the whole country.  To sum up, I regard the employment of the Royal Air Force with the unfettered right to make full use of the weapon of aerial bombardment,  as  the only practicable  means wecan employ locally of repelling foreign  invasion; and I would add that, so longas the Royal Air Force remain in this country with unrestricted powers  of offence,the risk of an attack on Iraq by one  of her  neighbours may  be  dismissed asalmost negligible.    8.  On the other  hand, and  here I find myself once more trespassing outsidemy legitimate province, I feel that, if the Royal Air Force in this country wererestricted to reconnaissance work and  the  use  of  machine guns,  their effectivevalue in  protecting the  frontiers of Iraq  from invasion would be reduced tovanishing point.  I may perhaps  be forgiven  for pointing out that machine-gunning has to be undertaken at low- altitudes, which, while exposing the aircraft to the risk of heavy  casualties, cannot be  expected to produce the moral andmaterial  effect which would be necessary to check the  advance of determinedtroops.   The casualties which machine-gunning on a large scale vrould involvewould, in any case, add considerably to the need for reinforcements, which mightwell prove beyond our capacity to provide.   The intensive bombing of an invadingarmy  which was straggling  with a long  transport  train  through  a narrow-mountain pass might, however, be so destructive as to paralyse its advance.     9.  If I have correctly gauged the  effect which prohibition  of bombardmentfrom the  air would be likely to have on our ability to implement the obligations of our alliance, it follows that, should prohibition be accepted by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and made applicable to this country, we should  be faced with the       [8099]                                                     B 2
    alternative either of cancelling the alliance altogether, or arranging to implement    it in some other way, e.g., by the location of Imperial land forces in this country    in  time of peace.  The first alternative  appears to  me to  be a betrayal of our    trust and of the obligations which we assumed before  the League when  we    persuaded them  to agree to the termination of the mandate.  I have attempted    to show that the second alternative could not be successfully negotiated with the    Iraqi Government, even if we were  prepared to face the prohibitive recurring    cost which would be entailed.  King Feisal, and any Iraqi  Government that can    be  foreseen,  would bitterly oppose the location of Imperial land forces in Iraq    for the period of the treaty, as an occupation which would, in effect, transform    the country into a British protectorate, and, in my evidence before the  Permanent    Mandates Commission  at Geneva, I admitted that  there would be some  force    in  this argument (see p.  121  of  the  minutes  of the  21st  session of the    Permanent Mandates  Commission) &quot;If there had been any question  of main-    taining infantry battalions, for instance, the chairman&apos;s doubts might have been    much more difficult to dispel.&quot;        10.  I have refrained from alluding to a  third alternative, viz.. that  we    should  maintain an alliance in name in the knowledge that we had no means of    implementing our undertaking to come to the defence of Iraq, as I have assumed    that  such a  cynical  view of our obligations would never  find favour with His    Majesty&apos;s Government.        11.  I will now turn to the question of the effect which the prohibition of    aerial bombardment might be expected to have on the future of Iraq, with special    reference to the internal stability of the country.    I  leave aside the question    whether or not the Iraqi  Government would  be  invited to subscribe to a self-    denying ordinance in  regard to aerial bombing in dealing with their internal    troubles; and I may be permitted to  express the opinion that neither  Persia nor    Turkey would be prepared to consent  to such a restriction in the case of their own    nationals. Although it is true that under article 5 of  the 1930 Treaty, the respon-    sibility for the maintenance of internal order in Iraq rests Avith the King of Iraq    alone, there are (apart from the lives of about 1,000 British, and 3,000 British    Indian civilians) certain important British interests in this country, such as oil-    fields, pipe-lines, Imperial Airways,  the port  of  Basra and  railways, which, if    threatened with serious injury, and if Iraqi forces were unable to safeguard them    adequately without  assistance, might call for the protection of the  Royal Air-    Force.  For instance, if Iraqi troops were engaged in suppressing a revolt of the    tribes of the Middle Euphrates, it is possible that the  Kurds might be emboldened    to rebel on their own account,  and might threaten to cause damage to  the Iraq    Petroleum Company&apos;s immensely valuable oilfields and plant at Kirkuk.    The    mere presence of the Royal Air Force in a central base in this country would be a    powerful moral deterrent against sabotage of this kind, provided that its powers    of offence were unimpaired. But if  it should be known to the warlike tribes of    Iraq that the  claws of  the  Royal Air Force had been clipped  and their  teeth    extracted by the prohibition of aerial bombing, the moral effect of their presence    would immediately vanish.  Again the term &quot;civilian population&quot;  has a very    different meaning in Iraq from what it has in Europe.  When an Iraqi tribe&apos; is    on  the  warpath, the whole of its male population are potential fighters, as the    tribes are heavily armed.  Let us suppose that the intervention of the Royal Air    Force for the protection of the Kirkuk oilfields from the attacks of Kurdish rebels    was considered necessary.  The procedure would be as follows.  Aircraft would    be  despatched over  the area where  the  trouble was expected and would  drop    warning leaflets  and issue oral objurgations by an interpreter,  through a  loud-    speaker.   In the great majority of  cases these warnings would be sufficient to    deter the rebels from attacking British property.  If, however,  they  still niain-    tained a threatening attitude, bombs would be dropped in places where they would    produce the greatest moral effect, without the intention to cause casualties.  In no    case would a village be bombed without previous warning, which would enable the    inhabitants to evacuate it.  If this proved of no avail, intensive bombing designed    to interrupt the normal life of the tribesmen and to keep them out of their villages.    would  be resorted to.    This form of attack,  though it causes exceedingly fewv   casualties, has never yet failed to produce the desii-ed effect.  In the whole course    of the operations undertaken by the Royal Air Force during the last three years    against  the  tribes  of   the  Southern  Desert,  and  Sheikh   Mahmud   and
Sheikh Ahmad of Barzan in the north, I believe it is correct to say that less than half a dozen casualties among the non-combatant population in Iraq were causedby bombing, which means  that it is far the most humane as well as inexpensivemethod of punishment that can  be employed in these regions.    It is generally agreed that bombing of  rebel tribesmen in the East  produces more effect and farless resentment than ground operations against their villages.   The  reason forthis is obvious.   Ground troops, unless under  the strictest discipline, are prone toindulge in pillage and to outrage the modesty of the women, while bombing fromthe air is regarded almost as an act of God. to  which  there is no effective reply, butimmediate submission.    12.  I trust I  have said  enough to indicate  my conviction that whateverformula may be adopted at Geneva for the limitation of armaments, the impositionon the Royal Air Force of an unequivocal restriction on aerial bombing  in theIraq of to-day would strike at the roots of  the policy which has been followed by successive Governments  in Great Britain during the past few years.    I do notthink it is going too far  to say that the effectiveness of the Royal Air Force wouldbe completely paralysed thereby, and that it would  no longer be worth while forus to retain air forces in this country at all.  I have stated my opinion on formeroccasions that Iraq cannot be expected to stand on her own legs without a Britishalliance, or to maintain  her internal stability during the next few years withoutthe moral effect which is produced by the presence of British air forces, especiallyin the centre of the country.  I therefore enter an earnest appeal that it may befound possible to exclude Iraq from the application of a restriction which, in myopinion, would imperil  her security, both  from within and  from without, andwould place in jeopardy important British interests and the maintenance  of ourImperial communications in this country.    13.  I apologise for  the  discursiveness of this  despatch,  which has been written under difficult conditions.  I do not know whether the views expressedtherein on a highly technical subject will find favour elsewhere; such as  they are,they are my own and strongly held.                                               I have. &amp;c.                                                     F. H.  HUMPHRYS.
