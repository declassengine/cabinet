THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  January  1933.SECRET.                                                Copy No.    54CP.  9   (33).CABINET.      PROGRAMME  FOR THE DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE.    THE Cabinet of Thursday referred  the  Appendix  to  my  previous paper(CP.  3  (33)) to the Ministerial Committee which met to-day and as the resultof the Committee&apos;s discussion I was asked to draw up a revised paper, which is annexed.  It seems best to circulate it at once without first getting it checkedby the other Members of the Committee, so that all Members of the Cabinet mayhave time to read it before our meeting on Monday.    &apos;2.  A good  deal of the difficulty that was felt about the previous documentarose  from the fact that it was so phrased as not to make it quite clear whether itwas (i) a programme of work to be suggested to the Disarmament Conference as anew and  better  procedure, or (ii) a further  declaration of British  policy and proposals.  The new draft is so framed as to make it clear that its only functionis to serve as a programme of work. In order to put this beyond question, I should propose, if the Cabinet approves the programme, to say in  the course of proposingit to the Bureau, that this is not a fresh statement  of policy by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom, but a list of topics, and suggestions as to how they should be handled by the Disarmament Conference.  It  is a programmeof work and not a statement of what  His Majesty&apos;s Government can agree  to.1 would point out that, in submitting this programme as an agenda paper tothe Conference,  it has not  been thought necessary to  mention figures for  suchmatters as maximum weights of tanks, calibre of guns, weights  of aircraft andso forth, for the reason that our view on these matters has already been announced in earlier statements.  I would propose, in connection  with  the  Air, to mention the exception as to police bombing.    3.  The Five-Power Agreement signed on the 11th December approved theprinciple of &apos;&apos; The grant to Germany, and to the other Powers disarmed by treaty.of equality of rights  in a system which would provide security for all nations.&apos;&quot;Consequently it is absolutely necessary to include in the programme of work some reference to security  as well as  to equality of rights.  It is, of course, possiblethat the reference (in I (2)) will not satisfy the  French, though there is reasonto think  that the  present  French Government  realise  that  portions  of  their security plan, e.g.y for an international force and international  dumps of arms,must  be dropped.   But in order  to avoid the  possibility of  any inference being drawn that in making any proposals for a scheme of work  we were committing ourselves  in advance to the French  plan or any part of it, I propose to  stateexpressly in this connection that we are not committing  ourselves in advance tothese  proposals and reserve our judgment on  any conclusions which may emerge from  any of the proposed enquiries.                                                                    J. S.    Foreign. Office, January 20, 1933.6706  [8129]
APPENDIX.    The Bureau  proposes  to the  General  Commission that  the following programme of work should be adopted to facilitate progress at the DisarmamentConference :      The General Commission decides that  the future work of the conference should be conducted on the following lines, the direction of the work being placedin the hands of the Bureau :                                     I.    The aim  of the  Bureau should be  to organise without  delay  practicaldiscussion of the following topics, with the object of framing a Convention orConventions embodying them so far as they are ultimately approved :     (1) A solemn affirmation, to be made by all  Kuropean States, that they will          not in any circumstances attempt to  resolve any present or future          differences between them by resort to force.    (2) The immediate study by the continental European States with a view to          their mutual security of the possibility of reaching political arrange-          ments defining the conditions in  which each of them will be entitled          to the co-operation of the other contracting States.    (3) The application of the principle that the limitations on  the armaments          of Germany and the other disarmed States shall be contained in the          same Disarmament Convention as that which will define the limita-          tions on the armaments of others, so that the articles in Part V of the          Treaty of Versailles,  which at present limit  Germany&apos;s arms and          armed forces,  and the corresponding  provisions of the other  Peace          Treaties, would be replaced by the Disarmament Convention as far as          the disarmed States are concerned.    (4) The application of the principle that the newly-expressed limitations in          the case of Germany and the other disarmed States shall last for the          same period and be subject to the same methods of revision  as  those          of  all other countries; and the  embodiment  in the  Disarmament.          Conference of  an undertaking on  the part of the signatory States to          enter  upon  negotiations  in  due  course  before  the expiry of  this          Convention with a view to concluding a new Disarmament Convention          for the purpose of further adjustment of armaments.    (5) The embodiment  in  the  Convention,  as  regards  war  material, of the          principle  of qualitative equality, and the provision for the realisation          of such equality, if not immediately after its entry into force, then by          specified  stages.   The reduction  of  the armies  of  the continental          European  States to a uniform general type of organisation that of a          national short-service army with  limited effectives.                                    II.(A) Security.    The Political Commission should be instructed at once to study the methodsof giving effect to point (1) above.    A Committee of  the European continental  States should be immediatelyconstituted to examine point (2) above.(B) Disarmament.    (a) Effectives. The Bureau  shall at once undertake the following work :        (i) In accordance with the plan for the calculation of land forces contained          in the proposals of President Hoover, compute  the totals of personnel          of the &quot; police  component &quot; (the irreducible component) of the existing          land forces of each country, both metropolitan and overseas.  For this          purpose it shall instruct the Effectives Committee to make to it within             -  days  recommendations concerning the  ratios to be employed          in  this calculation.    If within  that time the Effectives Committee          has been unable to reach a unanimous recommendation, it must report
           fully to the Bureau the state of its discussions, and it will be for the           Bureau to take a definite decision.     (ii) Agree  upon the percentage by  which the &quot; defence component *&apos; (the           excess over the &quot; police component&quot;) of each State shall be reduced,           such  reduction to be effected by a certain date or dates to be  specified.    (iii) Determine the stages and methods by which European continental long-           service armies may be transformed into national short-service armies.           For the discussion of this point, the Bureau may require the Effectives           Committee to submit recommendations.    (b) Land War Material. The Bureau shall       (i) Fix the maximum  tonnage of tanks and their numbers for each State.     (ii) Decide as to the disposal of tanks exceeding that limit whether they           shall be scrapped, and. if so, the dates by which such scrapping must           have  been effected.    (iii) Fix for the future the maximum calibre of mobile land guns and decide           as to the treatment of existing mobile land guns exceeding that calibre.    (iv)  Decide  whether there should be  a limitation  of  the  numbers of  mobile           land  guns of allowed calibre.    (c) Air. The Bureau shall at once constitute a committee of representativesof the  principal  Air Powers to examine the possibility of the entire abolition ofmilitary and  naval  machines and  of bombing from  the air, combined withan effective international control of civil aviation.   As  a  preliminary  to  thedecision to be taken by the Committee of Air Powers, the  Bureau shall at once       (i) Fix the maximum unladen weight of military and naval aircraft.     (ii) Decide  as to the disposal  of machines exceeding that limit whether           they  shall be scrapped, and, if so. the dates by which scrapping must           have  been effected.    (iii) Fix the numbers of  machines not exceeding the unladen weight limit           which may be allowed to each  State.    (d) Naval  Forces. The  Bureau shall  fix  the  maximum   tonnage  and maximum calibre of gun for       (i) Capital ships.     (ii) Aircraft carriers (if these are allowed  to be retained or replaced).    (iii) Cruisers.    (iv)  Destroyers.     (v)  Submarines  (if these are allowed to be retained  or  replaced).    The Bureau shall request the five principal Naval Powers to meet togetherat once  to discuss the possibility  of  completing the Treaty of  London, thusregulating the naval situation as between  them until the end of 1936.    On receipt of a  report of the results  of this meeting  of the five Powers, the bureau shall add to  their number representatives of the other Naval Powers forthe purpose of agreeing on limitation figures for all signatories of the Convention.
