COPY IIP.  /^//                          CABINET.      CO!HvilTTEE ON THE TOTALISATOR OK  GREYHOUND  RACING TRACKS.                      SUPPLSLENTARY REPORT.     1,   Since the Committee issued their Report (CP.  1(33))  on the     20th January, 1933,  it has been brought to  their notice that     having regard to certain undecided points of lav/ and to the  appeals     which  are pending or may be anticipated,  it is possible that a     delay  amounting to  several months may ensue before the situation     with regard to tote  clubs will be clear,  and before it is  possible     to take effective action to bring about the complete suppression of     these  clubs.   There is the further risk that as a result  of an     adverse decision in  the Courts it may still be possible for  tote     clubs  to  carry on their activities by devices which the Courts     may decide are not contrary to the existing law.    The Committee     accordingly held a furtner meeting on the 24th  instant to  consider     whether the Cabinet  should be recommended to introduce legislation     to deal with  to to clubs.   The Committee took the opportunity of     reviewing the whole  question  of the use of  the  tote both in the     tote clubs and on greyhound tracks in the light  of the altered     situation.    The Committee think  that it may be  convenient to the     Cabinet to have the  following summary of the possible courses of     action together with a brief  statement  of  the arguments for  and     against each  course  and a list of the specific  questions on  which     Cabinet decisions are required.     2,   The problem may conveniently be considered  under two  heads:-     Tote Clubs.     3.   The Committee  are of opinion that  there will be no
support in any quarter  for the U3e of the tote in tote  $5cluhs and that strong pressure vail he brought to bearboth in Parliament and in the country for the completesuppression of these clubs.     The only question requiring a Cabinet decision is which of the following two courses would he more expedient for                                        to introducesecuring this object, viz :  either (i)/a Bill declaring, and,if necessary, extending the scope of the existing law so as toensure that there vail be no delay in putting an end to theseclubs throughout Great Britain, or (2) for tho Government to announce their intention in the most explicit terms to bring these clubs to an end, making it clear that if the existing law, as enforced by proceedings in the Courts, proves to be insufficient for this purpose, the Government will not hesi-tate immediately to introduce the necessary legislation. Ifcourse (2) is adopted, arrangements should be made to secure areconsideration of the law as laid down in the Strathern case with a view to the legal position in Scotland being broughtinto conformity with the position in England and \7ales.  the choice between these alternatives depends to  some extent onthe policy which the Government decide to adopt in regard tothe tote on greyhound tracks.The Tote on Greyhound Racecourses.4.   The effect of the recommendations made in G,P0 1(33) wasthat the Cabinet should decide  against the introduction oflegislation to legalise the use of the tote on these tracksand that in announcing their decision the Government shouldmake it clear that while the law as declared by  the Courtswould be enforced tho question of the use of  the tote andother questions relating to betting generally could not bedealt with piecemeal but must be reserved for consideration in the light of the final  recommendations of  the RoyalCommission.5,   The Committee have reviewed this recommendation in viewof the possibility of legislation being required todeal with tote clubs0
6.   There are only three possible courses which mightbe adopted in regard to the use of the tote on greyhoundtracks.     (A)  to decide, as already recommended by the          Committee in CP. 1(35), that there should          be no legislation to legalise the use of          the tcte and that the question whether there should          be such legislation in the future should be left          open for consideration until the final Report          of the Royal Commission is received.   Mean-          while the existing lav/ should be enforced by          prosecutions;     (B)  to accept the recommendation of the Royal          Commission that the use of the tote on          greyhound tracks should be brought to an          end as soon  as possible and to decide that          the Government are not prepared in any          circumstances to legalise the tote;     (0)  to introduce a Bill to legalise the tote          subject to control by some central authority          and probably under conditions to secure that          the tote will yield no profit to the          promoter.
7.As regards (A) the arguments for this course (i)  It avoids  any necessity for  legislation  on   this topic.   The main rejection to  the   Government  introducing a Bill  to deal  only   with tote  clubs is  that it might in fact be   found politically impracticable to  resist   the extension of such a Bill to the tote   on tracks.    On the other hand any  attempt   to extend  a  tote club Bill to  the tote  on   tracks could be resisted on the ground that   Parliament  ought not to deal piecemeal with   une aspect  of betting on these tracks,(ii)  Tjte clubs and the tote on tracks stand   on a different footing.  There is universal   condemnation of the former, whereas opinion   is sharply  divided about the latter,  and   many plausible arguments can be advanced   in its support.8.     The arguments against course (A) are :-     (i) It does not give effect to the Interim Report        of the Royal Commission.    (ii) The Government will be criticised for        failure to come to a final decision.   (iii) Enforcement of the law against the tote        on these tracks will in fact lead to their        virtual suppression, and the Government        might be open to an accusation of sharp        practice when, on the one hand they say        that they have an open mind, while on the        ether hand they are aware that executive        action, for which they are responsible,        will eventuallybring about the discontinuance        of the tote on these tracks.   (iv)  Delay in coming to a decision may result        in a situation in which it will be very        difficult for the Government to resist        a demand for the legalisationcf the tote.    (v)  Such a policy would in effect give a       monopoly to the bookmakers on these tracks.
9.    As regards (B),  the arguments for thiscourse are :-     (i)  It is in accordance with the        unanimous recommendation cf the        Royal Commission which made no        distinction &quot;between the tote in        clubs and on  tracks.    (ii)  It avoids any criticism of        procrastination on the part of        the Government.10.   The arguments against course (3)  are :     (i) It will be strongly opposed by        the vested interests who will        attack the Government for destroy-        ing the capital invested and for        causing additional unemployment.    (ii) It will be misrepresented as class        legislation aimed at the poor man&apos;s        recreation, while allowing the        tote to be used on horse racecourses   (iii) There is no such overwhelming        preponderance of opinion for the        suppression cf the tote on tracks        as to justify what will be regarded        in some quarters as an unwarranted        interference with the liberty of        the subject.    (iv)  It  suppresses  one  form  of betting        but  leaves  unaltered the  other  form        of betting  through  bookmakers.5.
      If this policy is adopted the same question arises as-arises in the case of tote clubs, namely, should a Bill forthis purpose be introduced immediately or should the questionof legislation he left over until it is seen whether proceedings in the Courts prove ineffective to secure the discontinuance of the tote on these tracks.11.  As regards C, the arguments for this course are :-       (i) It is illogical to refuse to legalise the           tote on tracks while no steps are taken           even tc restrict the volume of betting           through bookmakers.      (ii) The loss that will otherwise be incurred           by the proprietors of the tracks and of           the Tote Companies.     (iii) This form of betting has been practised           for several years by a large section of           the population in the belief that it was           not contrary to  the law.      On the other hand for the reasons set out on page 4of CP. 1 (33) the arguments against any form of legalisationof the tote on tracks seem  to the Committee to be so strongthat they are certainly not prepared to recommend theadoption of this course before the Final Report of  the RoyalCommission,, has been received and before the question ofbetting whether by totalisators or by bookmakers and othercognate questions can be considered as a whole.
12o   The  specific  questions on which decisions  of  the cabinet are  required are -     1 *   Toto Clubs.         (a)  Should  legislation be  introduced  immediately              declaring and,  if necessary,  extending the              scooe cf the existing  law so  as to ensure that              there will be no delay in putting an end  to              these clubs throughout Great  Britain?  or         (b)  Should  the Government  announce their intention              in the  most explicit terms to bring those clubs              to an endj making it clear that if the existing              law, as enforced by proceedings in the Courts              prove to be insufficient for  this purpose,  the              Government will not hesitate  immediately to              introduce the necessary legislation?              If course (b) is adopted, arrangements should              be made to secure a reconsideration of the law              as laid down in the Strathern case with a view              to the legal position in Scotland being brought              into conformity with the position in England              and  wales.     2*   Tote on Greyhound Racing Tracks.         (a)  Are  the Government prepared to introduce              legislation to  legalise the use of the Tote on              greyhound racing tracks in any circumstances?:              If not:-              Do the Government prefer:-              (i)   To decide now that in no circumstances will                   they legalise the use of the Tote?  If they                   decide in  favour of this course the further                   question arises -
                (a)  whether a Bill to abolish all forms of                     totalisator betting should be introduced,  or                (b)  whether the question of legislation should                     be deferred until it is seen whether it is                     possible without legislation, by enforcing                     the existing law to bring to an end the use                     of the Tote on tracks.           ors-           (ii) While enforcing the existing law as declared                by  the Courts, to decide that  the general                question of the use of the Tote on tracks and                other questions relating to betting must be                deferred until the Final Report of the Royal                Commission  is received.                Signed  on behalf of  the Committee -                                     JOHN GILMOUR.                                Chairman.tehall Gardens,  S.W.114th January,  1933.
