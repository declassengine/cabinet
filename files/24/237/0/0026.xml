TO  BE KEPT  UNDER LOCK AND  KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to     ensure the secrecy of this document.CRLTV                                                  Copy No.  ,34...(33).      &apos;  &apos;              NAVY ESTIMATES  FOR 1933.         MSKIPrandum &quot;by the gi rst Lord of toe Adr:iiraity.               I wish to remind lay  colleagues of a serious warning     which I gave to the Cabinet in CP.64  (32),  at the  time of the     crisis at Shanghai, in regard  to the Navy&apos;s deficiency in     material necessary for the performance of  its duty  in any     emergency.          2.   I drew attention to  the  fact that this deficiency     was due to the Defence Services having been subjected to the     principle of &quot;no great war for ten  years&quot;,  and I pointed out     that owing to this deficiency  it would he  impossible for us     to  retain our hold on Hong Kong  if  our position there were     challenged, whereas Singapore  and  Trincomali could  be reduced     before our Fleet could reach them.          3.   I spoke then particularly of the  Far East,  hut the     situation is also disturbing in other  parts of the  world,  and     the responsibility of the Admiralty has been gravely increased     by  a decision reached by the Cabinet on the 23rd March last,     whereby, in effect, the principle  of &quot;no great war  for ten years&apos;     was abandoned.          4.   The history of this  &quot;ten  years rule&quot; and  its     abandonment, is given in Appendix  I.          5.   In view of the abandonment of this rule,  the Admiralty     considered it necessary to take  stock  of the position in which     we  stand, in regard particularly to  the accumulation of the     essential stores and defensive equipment,  and the completion     cf  the defensive works and measures (chiefly for protection     against submarine attack) which  are necessary to enable the     Fleet to operate freely and exTuctively in  the event of war,                                                         &quot;L)\L *fc 0 0 u * *
&quot;but which, have either been entirely in suspense or proceeded with very slov/ly and intermittently, whilst the preparationof Navy Estimates has been subject to the  rule abovement ion ed.     6.   Owing to the severe pruning of the Navy Estimateafor nanj1&apos; years past, the necessary seaward defences arelacking at our Bases, and the stocks of stores for the Fleetare deficient.  In addition, the equipment for the auxiliaryvessels and largo number of small eruft, the need for whichis apt to be overlooked, but which form a  vital element inour defence measures, is seriously incomplete and, in certainessentials, non-existent.  As a result, the Navy  is definitelyunready to carry out its duties in the protection of theEmpire and its communications in the event of an  early warin the East,     7.   The stock of Oil Fuel, and - mere important still -the storage for containing it, which the Committee of ImperialDefence have decided that we should have available in  theevent of hostilities, have also  to be completed.  A note on thesubject of the Oil Fuel Reserve will be found in  Appendix II-,     8.   After very careful consideration, the Admiraltyreached the conclusion that to provide for all thoseessential measures and reserves would require a very large  bum0     9.   Even if unlimited funds were available, It would,of course, be impossible to overtake all arrears  in a single  -year, or indeed, for several years.  But the abandonment ofthe &quot;ten years rule&quot; inevitably increased  the responsibilityof the Admiralty, and they accordingly considered it to be their duty to ask for provision for making an immediate startin this direction.     10.  Appreciating, however, the importance of the Cabinetdirection that the Defence Departments&apos; proposals must haveregard to the serious financial situation  still existing,                                                      and * ..
3and also recognizing the difficulty of suddenly effectinga great acceleration in trie rate of making good the deficiencies in question, the Admiralty were prepared totake only a very small step in that direction in 1933, onthe understanding that the question of adopting a regularprogramme for remedying the whole of the deficiencies withinsome definite period should he considered before theEstimates for 1934 were prepared.     11.  I accordingly proposed to the Chancellor of theExchequer the following special provision in addition t o t henormal requirements of the year;-     Defensive Equipment       and Reserves ...   ...   ...    100,000     Oil Fuel Storage .   ...   ...    118,000     Flights for Fleet       Air Arm      . ........    146,000     Oil Fuel ...   .o.......    1005000                                     jS464.000     12.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer has found himselfunable to agree to the inclusion of any part of thisprovision.  As regards the Fleet Air Arm, he finds itdifficult to justify expenditure on additional flights &quot;inview of the Government commitments in other directions&quot;, whichI presume to mean the Government&apos;s proposals at Geneva, forthe general reduction of Air Armaments.  As regards theother items, he has informed me &quot;that though he sympathizeswith the difficulties of the Admiralty he would not bejustified in accepting an increase of expenditure in such aconnection this year.  His view remains that expressed inthe Treasury memorandum of the 11th March 1932, preparedfor the Committee of Imperial Defence (1087-B), vizt that financial and economic riskB are by far the most serious and urgent that the country has to face and that other risksmust be run until the country has had time and opportunityto recuperate and our financial situation to improve.
     13.  The very slow  and inadequate rate of progress which has &quot;been made in remedying  the deficiencies mentionedhas hitherto been covered by the  decision of the Cabinetthat the Estimates of the Defence Departments were to he prepared on the basis of the &quot;ten years rule&quot;.  That is tosay, the Admiralty have hitherto been cleared of their responsibility in the matter by a Cabinet decision basedon an estimate of the in t era at ion al  situation for which theAdmiralty has no responsibility.     14.  I need hardly say that I fully appreciate theChancellor&apos;s point of view.  But in  view of the abandonment of the &quot;ten years rule&quot; it is essential that I should bring to the notice of the Cabinet the unpreparedness of theNavy, which the Admiralty view with  the gravest concern.     15o  I hope that the Cabinet will feel able toauthorise a substantial part at least of the very smalladditional expenditure which I propose, so that we may atany rate start to make good our deficienciesc  If not, Ithink that my colleagues will agree  that the Admiralty areentitled to have an assurance from the Cabinet that they realise and take responsibility for  the continued unreadinessof the Navy.                         (Intld.;  B.S.M.ADMIRALTY, S.V. 1.     8th February 1933 .
I180           MB &quot;Tffft IBAILISLS&quot;          Except in 1932j when Departments worked toan emergency figure calculated on the basis of Command3952, the Estimates of the Defence Departments have for many years &quot;been based on Cabinet decisions as tothe assumptions to be cade in regard to the probability of ware2.        The first of these decisions was given in 1919,and was to the effect that the Estimates for the three fighting Services were to be built up on the assumptionthat no great war was to be anticipated within the noxtten years.30        This was superseded in 192G by a decision thatit should be assumed for the purposes of framing theEstimates of the Fighting Services that an any given datethere would be no major war for ten years, which latterand more stringent assumption has in practice been subjectto the interpretation proposed by the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee in paragraph 14 of 0*1.Do Paper 900 B. ofJuly 1928.4B        7/hilst the Admiralty&apos;s proposals for navy estimates from year to year have been prepared on the basesthus laid down, they have in practice been subject every year to severe pruning to meet the financial exigencies of the time.  As an instance of this, the accumulation ofthe Oil Fuel Reserve for the Navy, to which not only theAdmiralty but also the Committee of Imperial Defence have always attached the highest importance, has for several                                                 years...0
years been in a state, first of partial,  and later of complete suspense05.        The Committee of Imperial Defence in  theMinutes of its 255th Meeting, endorsed conclusion (a)in paragraph 40 of the Chiefs of Staff Annual lleviewfor 1932 (OoloD. paper No. 1032-B), viz., that  theassumption governing Ustimatos of the Defence departments in recent years should &quot;bo cancelledc6.        The Cabinet (19 (32), Conclusion 2, of the23rd March 1932) in effect accepted this  recommendationof the Committee of Imperial Defence, though they addedthat this must not he taken to justify the expandingexpenditure v/ithont regard to the very serious  financialand economic state that still obtains.
                                     AEEpmil JI           In 1919  the War Cabinet decided that aReserve of Oil Jniel  uould &quot;be provided for the Navy,equal  to 12 months Fleet consumption on a war basis,and  this Reserve and the necessary storage v/ere steadilyproceeded  with for several years, the construction of storage being kept well ahead of the accumulation of oile2.         In 1924  the Committee of Imperial Defence re-affirmed the basis of the Reserve, and decided that thetotal  Reserve should he completed by 1937, the yearlyaccumulation to he worked out between the Admiralty andthe  Treasury0  The average annual increase necessary toensure completion  by 1937 was, in fact, 330,000 tons ayear,  and  320,000  tons were actually provided for in 1925 a30         In 1926  arid 1927, however, the Admiralty proposals to add 330,000 tons were not accepted by the Cabinet, and only 100,000 tons  were added in each year, the Cabinet*responsibility for the consequent lag in the programme for completion of the  Reserve being placed on recordc4.       A  The admiralty s proposal to add 330,000 tons to the Reserve in  1928 was referred to the Naval ProgrammeSub-Committee of the Cabinet, which reported in favour ofmaintaining  the principle that some addition to the reserves should be  made each year, but recommended that the amountto he  added  in 1928 should bo 100,000 tons &quot;on the&quot;understanding that the Cabinet accept full responsibility&quot;for this  decision, and that tho  arrangement for the&quot;addition  of 100,000  tons to the  Oil Juel Reserve in 1923&quot;is  without  prejudice  to  the farther consideration of the                                                questions...
2&quot;questions before the Committee, and in particular to&quot;the amounts, if any, to bo added to the reserve in future&quot;years&quot;  Tho Cabinet approved this recommendation, subjectto the deletion of the words &quot;if any&quot; underlined in thepreceding sentences5o        In December 1928 the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the First Lord reported to the Cabinet that they had agreed that the addition to the Reserve in 1929 should bethe same 3s in 1923, visto, 100,000 tons, the First Lordadding that &quot;Bo far as I am concerned, this agreement has&quot;been reached on the understanding that the Cabinet, as last&quot;year, realise and take responsibility for the fact that the&quot;progress that is being oade in the completion of this vital&quot;Reserve is, for financial reasons, being retarded much&quot;beyond the limits which the Board of Admiralty think safe&quot;or which the strictest interpretation of the Cabinet ruling&quot;on the subject of the improbability of a major war can&quot;justify&quot;06C        In 1930 llr0 Snowden, as Chancellor of the Exchequer,only consented to the Hew Construction Programme of the year on condition that a reduction of  4,000,000 was effected onthe Navy Estimates, and indicated the omission of allprovision for adding to the Oil Fuel Reserve as one of the savings that should be made.7,        A Liemorondum by the Sea Lords, expressing theirstrong dissent from this decision, and their views as tothe vital importance of this Reserve, was forwarded by theFirst Lord to tho Prime Minister, and taken note of by theCabineto80        Similar action was taken in 1931 when the Chancellor                                                Of...o.*
of the Exchequer again refused to agree to any additionto the Reserve^9a        It will thus he seen that since 1924,  when tboCommittee of Imperial Defence re-affirmed the necessityfor the Reserve and decided that it should to completed by1937, provision lias only teen made in the Estimates  foradding 720-,000 tons to it.  In other words,  in a periodof 8 years only a little over 2, years&apos;  quota has teenprovided..
