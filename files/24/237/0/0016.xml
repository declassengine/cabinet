iCRETP.15(33)                                           Copy No                          CABINET.            HOUSING (FINANCIAL  PROVISIONS) BILL.            Memorandum by the Minister of Health.          Supporters of the Government are agitating for two additions to this Bill, (1) to make further provisionfor improving slums by reconditioning houses not bad enoughto pull down;  and (2) to encourage the provision or holding of small houses by public utility societies and similarbodies,     1.   Reconditioning.          On second reading Sir Austen Chamberlain, in a     speech that received much publicity, advocated     conferring on local authorities further powers to     enable them to purchase and recondition houses unfit     for human habitation, and that some subsidy should be     available  for the purpose.          Local authorities have now power to purchase     houses for reconditioning by agreement only,  and no     subsidy i*s available for the purpose  (except for rural     labourers&apos; cottages).     2.   Public Utility Societies.          A strong movement has developed both inside and     outside the House for further assistance for housing-     corporations on &quot;public utility&quot; lines, i.e,  with     limited profits.   There are many different forms of     the proposal, from the establishment of a big semi-     public housing corporation for the whole country, to     a mere extension of the limited guarantees under     Section 2 of the Bill to loans by local authorities     to associations of the sort.iIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVEPJHMENT.
          The Bill is in fact so limited, in its scope thatit is most improbable that amendments dealing with eithermatter can be brought into order.   Nevertheless,  theposition is not one in which it will, in my judgment, be wise to rely wholly on the rules of order to clear the front of the Bill.    There is a very considerable body of support for these views in the House:  and in the matter ofreconditioning it can make a strong case.          The passage of the bill and the cessation ofgeneral subsidies will introduce a new epoch in housing.The adaptation of our housing legislation to the conditionsof the new epoch will require attention.   In particular the most effective use of the money and machinery availablefor slum clearance should receive prompt reconsideration.          If my colleagues agree, I propose therefore toinform the House at an early opportunity in debate  that itis ray intention as soon as the 3ill is passed to set up a departmental committee to consider in particularreconditioning and the promotion of the building andownership of small houses by public utility societies, andany other improvements in our legislation for the promotion of house-building and the abolition of slums.          I shoMld propose to state expressly that the reference must be subject to the declared policy of theGovernment as to the cessation of the direct subsidies underthe Acts of 1923 and 1924, and that direct subsidies cannotbe replaced by indirect.          To this principle I should propose a minorexception, that the Committee should not be precluded fromconsidering the necessity of some sort of help from theExchequer for &quot;reconditioning&quot; in urban areas as well asrural.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer tolls me that hehas no objection to this exception.                           2.
          I have reason to suppose that the announcementof such a fresh inquiry, and an undertaking to givesympathetic consideration to any practical proposals towhich it may lead, will do much to satisfy the chiefadvocates of further legislation.   Apart from that, Ithink such a review &quot;of the situation will he very useful:and that it is indeed necessary.          The report of such a committee may, of course,produce a situation which will lead to some further legislation.   I see no likelihood of the legislation &quot;being very wide in scope.                        (Intld.) E.H.Y.27th January, 1933.
