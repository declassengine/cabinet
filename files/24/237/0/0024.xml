P. 23 3$7.                 Licensing of Manufacture of Arms.           On January 23rd, the Ministerial Committee      accepted certain conclusions on the subject of the      licensing of the manufacture of arms in this country      (Annex A).           Since the Committee met, my attention has been      drawn to the fact (of which neither I nor, I think, my      colleagues were aware) that the first of these con-      clusions was a reversal of the policy which had been      approved by the Cabinet as long ago as July 25th 1928      and which has since been^cpnsistently followed by      successive United Kingdom Delegations at Geneva.  This      policy is, in brief, that, in opposition to the French      and others who advocate a system of international      licences issued by the Disarmament Commission at Geneva,      we have advocated a system of national licences to be      issued to arms manufacturers by individual Governments      on their own responsibility.   This policy has been      supported at Geneva by all Governments (including the      United States Government) except those who are in favour      of international licences.   It was also announced in      Parliament in Decemberslast as that favoured by His      Majesty B Government provided that other countries      acted similarly.           If therefore we now declare ourselves against any      licensing system for manufacture, we shall not only      find ourselves isolated at Geneva as the-sole opponents      of any measure of licensing for the manufacture of      arms,  but we shall be compelled to announce in      Parliament that we have reversed our policy.   I should      view these prospects with great misgiving.                                                   The ...
     The principal argument put forward in the ministerial Committee against a national licensing system was that the number of manufacturers involved.was so large as to render the system vexatious andunworkable.   But the draft Convention (which in anycase is subject to amendment) only seeks to apply thesystem to factories producing- completed weapons orfinished essential parts easily recognisable ascomponents for such weapons.   The Committee at Genevais working on a list of arms and munitions which v/asdrawn up several years ago and which by common consentrequires amendment.   I am not clear that, even underthe list as it at present stands, the number of manufacturers who would be required to take outnational licences is as extensive as seems to be feared.But the list of articles is subject to revision;  andI am prepared to instruct the United Kingdom representa-tive on the Committee, in consultation with therepresentatives of the service departments at Geneva,to examine the list and see what proposals can be putforward for its simplification.   I am convincedthat the solution of our present difficulty lies on&apos;these lines rather than in the complete reversal of apolicy to which we have so consistently and so publiclycommitted ourselves, both here and in Geneva.

ANNEX.CONTUSION.     It was  agreed:&quot;  (I)   to instruct the United Kingdom representative  to       the Disarmament Conference that when the  question       of control of  manufacture of armaments came  up       for discussion and,  in particular,  the principle       of control by  a system of licences,  he       should oppose  any licencing system which  had as a       &quot;basis the idea of controlling and licencing  private       manufacturing  firms  on the grounds that the  members       of these firms were  so large that it was  quite       impracticable  to attempt to control them  by  this  method.(ii)  &apos;  that  he should be instructed, however, to       put forward a  proposal that the control of       manufacture of&quot; arms  could be more profitably       approached from the  angle of the control  of&quot;       exports, and should  add that we were prepared       to accept any  system of control of ex-oort of       arms which might be  found to be internationally       acceptable.iii).   that  if our representative desired additional       arguments to support his case, he might emphasise       the point that, at the present moment, with  the       exception of this country&quot;, all countries  export arms       freely, and in fact, are only too anxious to obtain       orders for arms in order to help unemployment  and       their armament industries, and that a far more       rigid system of control could, in our opinion, be       obtained by a  suitable system of export licencing       rather than attempting to adopt a system  of       licencing manufacture which would be extremely       complicated and, therefore, easy of evasion., Whitehall Gardens, S.7/.1.,      23rd January,  1933.
