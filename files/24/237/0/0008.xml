          THE IITDIAIv TART.?? B OARD1 S REPORT 017                     COTTOIT GOODS.         Hote hy the Secretary cf State for India.     The President of the Board of Trade has circulated tothe Cabinet a note, CP. 5 (33), cn this subject.  I have always contemplated that the matter should be discussed inthe Cabinet as soon as the views of the Government of india have been received.   In my opinion no discussion can usefullytake place in the Cabinet until then, as it is by no means tobe assumed that the Government of India will adopt therecommendations of the Tariff Board, and it is their viewsrather than the Tariff Board&apos;s recommendations that theCabinet will have to consider.   I have already asked theGovernment of India to let me have their views as scon aspossible.   My object in having a copy of the Tariff Board&apos;sReport communicated to the Board of Trade as soon as it hadbeen received was to facilitate subsequent consideration ofthe matter.      Meanwhile I should like my colleagues to know that thesubject is one which has been exercising me greatly and I amfully alive to the considerations which the President of theBoard of Trade has set forth.   Indeed I have already impressedthem upon the Viceroy in the course of private correspondence,and we can rely upon him to ensure that in the preliminary) document is the property of His Britannic Majesty1 s Government).

stage of formulating their views on the recommendationsof the Tariff Board the Government of India will take account of the very serious reactions which the adoptionof these recommendations would have, both economically and politically, in this country.
