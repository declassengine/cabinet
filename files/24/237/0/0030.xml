THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTTO BE  KEPT UNDER LOCK AND  KEY.        It is requested that special care may be taken to            ensure the secrecy of this dooument.                                 NO DISTRIBUTION.Decyoher.    Sir R. Lindsay  (Washington).                                 30th January,  1933,         D.   11.56 p,m.,  30th January,  1933.         R.    9.30 a.i7i. ,  31st January,  1933.Nos. 67 and 68.Secret.     1.   My conversation with Roosevelt  took  place  atWarm Springs on January  29th.   We  agreed that our discussions were tentative and that we were  ohviouslymaking no binding engagements.   He spoke throughout withremarkable frankness  and with obvious desire thateventual agreement shall be  achieved with His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment.   He said his own personal difficulties  wereimmense until he could have  a Cabinet to  help  him.He has about half of it  made up.    Of his Secretary  ofState and his Secretary  of the Treasury he had the oneend the other is not yet quite certain.    He expects to complete Cabinet by the middle of February  but itwould not be announced until just before  March 4th.     2.   His general scheme is as  described in my telegram No. 43 viz., a  comprehensive programme in whichdebts and other questions will automatically fall into their proper places.   He cannot contemplate piecemealaction and only by presenting Congress with  prospect ofcuring the world as well as  the domestic  situation can be  hope to ensure its support.  He  wishes to treat eachsubject on its merits..  He does not want  to  make any onecontingent on the other  though they must  be  treatedtogether and parallel to each other.  Hoover has urged him                                           that  if ...
if he separates the subJecto he v/111 lose bargaining power.   He rejects this view and does not wish to bargainone subject egainEt another.   3.   Time table he contemplates is as follows.   Hewants negotiations with His Majesty&apos;s Government to beginimmediately after March 4th and to be pressed forward with the utmost energy.   He particularly hopes thatthey will be finished and out of the way by April 10thas on that date or at any rate not later than April 20thspecial session of Congress must begin.   He means topresent to Congress without delay 5 or 6 great end importantmeasures, to force it tc confine itself to these, and touse utmost pressure to make it adjourn within 60 days.When Congress is out of the way he would v/ish the world economic Conference to be held.   4.   As to procedure for negotiation  with His Majesty!sGovernment he assures me positively that in spite of  every-thing he will be ready to do business by March 6th.   Hehopes that British &quot;number 2 man&quot; may be here then orimmediately after.   Some of staff might usefully arrive in preceding week.   He insists that discussions shallproceed entirely by private conversations with no generalmeetings, no speeches, and interference by the pressreduced to minimum.   He hopes that in 10 days or sosufficient progress will have been achieved for PrimeMinister to come out in person to finish matters off,and that he will stay in the White House.   5.   On the subject of debts he says there is a, legalend a moral side.    In the former he is not very muchintereLted.   He Xl willing to reduce them as far asconsiderations of  practical politics make it possible.                                                   He
He does not hold by standard of capacity to pay though hehad adhered to it in his statement of November 23rd,   Hebelieveo that a distinction can be made between paymentof interest and payment of principal and that he can makeout a case to congreso for foregoing former.   He takeBtotal debt as fundeds deducts total of payments already made which he regards as repayment of capital, and suggeststhat a new agreement be made for repayment of remainder.It would be spread over a period of years, but not he thinks Quite so long a period as 62 years.   He said atone moment that there would be no interest charge and atanother that there might have to te a nominal interestcharge representing cost of management,.   I did not askabout marketability but all the implication was that bondswould be non-marketable*   6.   To this scheme I said that so far as I could work it out it would not meet requirements of His Majesty*BGovernment;  that any scheme to be acceptable must notimperil Lausanne.   His answer was that conditions in thiscountry are really terrible, more so than in England(which is true), that Senator Robinson had just reportedto him that it would be quite impossible to get congress to agree to more than remission of interest and that if heand Hoover and an archangel from Heaven were all to beunited in asking it for more it would not avail.   He &quot;added that he had thought Chancellor of the Exchequersspeech at Leeds was &quot;rather crude&quot;.   I said I regarded it as very timely.   Expectations here were very exagger-ated and we were rapidly getting near to a head-on colli-sion.   Nobody here was stating the true situation ofopinion in England end it was high time it was stated.                                                       My

My own information from private friends in England was thatobligations of honour had worn very thin and that opinion was quite ready to refuse further payment altogether.   Hesaid he had heard  this already.   6a.   As regards tariffs he is most anxious that they shall be so handled as to increase international trade.He has a BchemG that is new to me which he calls &quot;TheInverted Quota&quot; by which on specified articles nothing morethan a revenue tariff shall be charged and a quantity ofarticles admitted to the country equal to a certain propor-tion (5, 6 or 7 per cent) of total amount manufactured.He also talked vaguely about mutual encouragement of tradeend he did not mention Ottawa at ellc   70   He says that silver must certainly be discussedbecause monetary policy of India halves the purchasingpower of the Par East.   He also mentioned stabilizationof currencies but very vaguely and I do not think he knowsmuch about it.   Indeed I should say that on all economicsubjects he is rather weak*   8.   He has a scheme for limiting production of wheatby international agreement between Canada, Australia^Argentine and United States.   This is a return to schemewhich was attempted about three years ago and failed owingto Anerican objections which will now be withdrawn.    Ofthis I understand you have been informed by Canadian HighCoirmissioner in London.   Hoosevelt hopes that negotiationsfor reaching agreement on this side will be carried proportionate Ottawa simultaneously with negotiations in Washingtonwith His Majesty!s Government and will have good effecton Congress.                                          9.
      He wants disarmament to be included in programme0Not.only is reduction of military expenses more than evernecessary almost everywhere to balance budgets but alsoCongress will never ceaoe rightly or wrongly to connectdebts and disarmament together,.   So far    land armamentsare concerned he is generally in favour of Hoover principleof strictest possible limitation of essentially offensiveweapons such as tanka and Ta.QQ.vy mobile guns.   He is alsoin favour of prohibiting totally use of aeroplanes for any military purposesu   They would exist solely for the pur^poses of commercao   I said I understood it was impossibleto distinguish properly aeroplanes for commercial purposesfrom those for military0   He caid that he believeddistinction could be made efficiently enough,  10o   As to naval disarmament he suggests  (1) Ad therewill be no military aeroplaneo there will be no need foraeroplane carriers thus providing a large Baving in tonnages,,(2) Similarly as fire of heaviest naval guns can only bedirected with the help of aeroplanesB these gunc will cease to have any utility and it will be possible to reducesize of battleships^   He seems only partially aware of difficulty he will have over this question with american naval staff,   (3) Though he cannot expect abolition of submarines he believes it may be possible to get agreement for a reduction of their size0  11.   He wants to contribute something towards politicalre-settlement and therefore towards security of Europe,,Though matter Is in no way an American interest and only slightly less so a British one, he mentioned the questionof Polish corridor which he understood was now at a                                                  poi&amp;t
point at which parties interested were (? prepared to)(? stop), talk and seek settlement.   What he contemplatedwas retrocession of corridor and grant to Poland cfcontinuous end uninterrupted independent railway corrmuni-cation with Gdynia-   I expressed liveliest alarm atthis suggestion and strongly deprecated it stating all the obvious things,   I am not convinced that he has gone into the question carefully and I think that we shall hearno more about it.  12.   This and other thingo led me to ask Roosevelt if he appreciated the importance of bringing the French governmentalong with us in everything.   Without this I said all thatwe could devise would fall into ruin sooner or later.   Heentirely agreed.   He said that the President was obsessedwith the idea that he must leave office with a &quot;cleanrecord&quot; and had wanted to present the French government witha dry formal protect against their &quot;default&quot;.   This Roose-velt had been able to stop.   His own idea was immediatelyafter March 4th to try to bring the French governmentforward perhapu by intimating to them verbally, butofficially that he hac never had exclusive ideao as to which governments he wao prepared to discuss with, and that herege.rded their failure to pay as a defer:ment  and not asa default.   He indicated however that they would be expect-ed to pay up December instalment.   He was quite aware thatclose contact would have to be kept with them in all other questions, and that this applied to other governments as                                                      well,
well, naming specially Italian and German.  13c   In regard to the Far East his view  is that thereis nothing to be done at present to step Japanese governmentand that the question can only be solved \y the ultimateinability of Japan to stand the strain any  longer.   his policy would be to avoid anything that would tend to relievethat strainc  14.
