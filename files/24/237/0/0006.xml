FIDENTIAL.A.O. 251.               BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL.-               STATE OF TRADE - DECEMBER, 1952.     Summary of Reports submitted by membera of the Board        of Trade Advisory Council&quot; (supplemented in some        cases with information&quot;from other sources).     Employment -  The total number of persons on the registers of Employment Exchanges in Great Britain at 19th December was2,723,287, a decrease of 76,519 as compared with 21st November.The main variations occurred in London, South Eastern andSouth western England (-16,062), North Western division ofEngland (-17,703) and North Eastern division (-32,759).  The-.,only district which showed an inorease was Scotland (-4-2,020).     Insured workers in employment at 19th.December numbered9,457,000, an Increase of 84,000 as compared with a monthearlier., hut a decrease of 148,000 as oompared with a year ago.The improvement in employment, as compared with the position amonth earlier, was mainly in the coal-mining, iron and steel,general engineering and ironfounding, cotton, jute andtailoring industries, In textile bleaching dyeing andfinishing, in the distributive trades, and in the hotel andboarding house service.   There was a further decline in building, and a slight falling off In the pottery, woollen and worsted, hosiery and boot and shoe industries.     Overseas Trade -  Imports in the month of Deoember, 1932,amounted to  60.6 million, a decrease of just under  1 million as compared with the previous month and of  16.4 as comparedwith December 1931.  Imports during the year 1932,  703.1 million, were  150.1 million less than in the year 1931.
    Exports in December of produce and manufactures of theUnited Kingdom amounted to  32.4 million, or  le4 million more than in the previous month and  368,000 more than inDecember 1931,  Exports in the year 1932,  365*1 million,showed a decrease of  25o5 million as compared with tho year1931.   Re-exports of inrported merchandise in the year 1932,amounted to  51 million, being  13 million les3 than in 1931.      The excess of imports over exports of merchandise forthe year 1932 was  287*1 million as oompared with an exoessof  406.8 in 1931.     Railway and Road Traffic.  -  During the five weeks and the 52 weeks ended 1st January, 1933, oompared with thecorresponding period last year, railway traffic reoeiptsdeclined by  709,000 (or 5.05 per cent.) and  13,697,000(or 8.75 per cent.) respectively.     The following statement shows the percentages for thevarious classes of txsaffio during the same periods -	5 weeks ended	52 weeks ended---------*	1st January,	1st January,	1933.	1933.Passenger train			- 3-14	- 6.30&quot; Goal, ooke and patent			+ 2.49	- 6*09Other freight train			-12*33	-13 o62All classes .....	- 5.05	- 8o75     NOT/ rogistrations&quot;of motor oyoles in November, 1932,compared with November, 1931, shaved an increase of 419(23.7^5) , and of other motor vehicles an increase of2,956 (19.7^).
      Coal-Mining -  During  the  115 weeks  ended December 24, the  average  weekly output was 4,524,000  tons, a decline of 3.1^ compared  with the  corresponding  period  of last year. The  average  number of persons employed weekly in the same period  was 776,C00^  58,000  less  than  in  the  corresponding period  of 1931.      The output  per person  per week was  5.57 tons, which was 0.22 tons and  0.59 tons higher  than in 1931  end 1913 respectively.      The exports of cool in December, 1932,  as compared with the  corresponding month of  the previous  year, show a decrease of 538,000 tons  and the coal sent for bunkering purposes an increase of  17,000 tons.      During  December, 1932, as compared  with 1931, there has been  a  noticeable  decline in the quantity of coal exported to Germany,  Prance and Italy, but an improvement in regard to Canada,  Denmark,  Norway, Sweden and Finland.   Despite imports of coal  from Germany and Polfmd  of 45,000 tons and 38,000  tons  respectively during the month of November,  1932, the  Irish Free State have imported from Great Britain 146,000 tons during  the same period, or  32,000 tons more than in the  preceding month.   During December, however, only107,000 tons of  coal  were exported from Great Britain,      The improved  condition of export trade on the NorthEast  Coast continues  nnd,  despite the restrictions imposed by European coal producing countries,  there is a morehoDeful outlook  than  there has been for a considerable  time a      Iron and steel  - Conditions in the iron and steel tr^de remain quiet.  The demand for pig  iratt has been fnirly steady  and has benefited to some extent by the absence  of continental competition.
      The production of pig ix-on in December,  1932,  showed a decrease of 46,000 tons compared with the corresponding month of 1931, and for the year 1932,  the  figure was  about 200,000 tons less than in 1951.    The  output  of steel ingots and castings in December, 1938,  was 5,000  tons more than in the same month of 1931, and for the year 1932, there  -was an increased output of 54,000 tons compared with 1931.     . There has been slightly more activity in the  export of steel sheets and tinplates.   A considerable  increase in the volume of enquiries generally from overseas markets has been experienced, but only a comparatively  small proportion has materialised in actual orders.      So far as Scotland and the North  East Coast are  concerned any pronounced improvement in the Iron and Steel Industry is dependent on a considerably greater activity  in shipbuilding of which there is little evidence at present,  although a few enquiries for new tonnage have been received.      In South Wales th;ere is a more hopeful feeling as most manufacturers have more orders on their booi:s than they have had for some time.      Shipping and Shipbuilding -  There has been a moderate improvement in freight rates, the index figure having advanced from 81.67 for November, to 84.15 for December,  the increase being probably due to  scarcity of tonnage owing  to the* indisposition of owners  to face long ballast  passages unfixed.- Chartering continued to be active for the -argentine and  a  fair amount of tonnage has been chartered by Australia, as well as slight improvements in the direction of South Africa and the East.   Outward business from this country continues unsatisfactory.  Shipbuilding shows a small improvement,  orders having been placed  for four large cargo ships and four small  coasting  vessels.   Sales of ships for breaking up and for running
purposes to foreign owners have been numerous.    Final figuresfor laid-up tonnage are not available, but from preliminaryreports it is expected that the quantity in this country will beyeduced by about 200,000 tons on 1st January as compared with1st October,     Machine Tools - There are some signs of improvement inthe home trade but the heavy industries &amp;re still depressed.In the export trade Russia is still the most importantmarket.   Exports in December fell to  167,317 as comparedwith the November figure of  296,558.   JSxports for the year1932, however, were  3.1 million as oompared with  2.2 million in 1931.     Electrical Industry - The production of electricity byauthorised undertakers in December, 1932, amounted to 1,266million units, an increase of 3,5$ as oompared with thecorresponding month in 1931,   For the whole year, theincrease was 7,1% as compared with 1931.     The percentage of productive oapaoity oacupied increasedslightly during the month, end is estimated at over 50;$oThe indices (1920   100) of orders received in December for heavy-&quot;plant were, home 67, corupored with 54 in November and46 in December, 1931;  export 69 (as for November), comperedwith 114 in December, 1931B     During the year, the industry has suffered severely owingto the world depression and to the gradual cessation of ordersby the Central Electricity Board for the !igrid,:.   The valueof the orders placed in 1932 amounted to  8., 3 50*000 comperedwith  3,600,000 in 1931.   The total amount sanctioned by theBoard for the conversion of equipment to the eLand^rd frequencyalso fell heavily, being  2,450,000 in 1932 compared with 3,800,000 in 1931.
     Motor Industry - There is little or no change in thehome trade, although there is growing evidence of an increasing demand for motor cars for domestic use.   Thedemand for the heavier type of commercial vehicles remains at a low level.   The export of the smaller type of private cars continues to expand.     Cotton - In December, the cotton industry experiencedthe best month since the beginning of the year, the improvementbeing due largely to the settlement of the disputes in the spinning and weaving sections of the industry.   There hasbeen a slight fall in the number of operatives whollyunemployed and the number of short time workers is now only about one half of the total wholly unemployed.   Raw cottondelivered to spinners during the five woeks ended December 30amounted to 248,000 bales, compared with 264,000 in thecorresponding period of 1931.   Exports of piece goods forDecember were 196 million square yards compared with 159million for the previous month and 150 million in December,1931.   The competition sf Japanese piece goods continues toincrease.   The total cotton piece goods exported fromGroat Britain during the first ten months of 1931 and 1932were 1,441 million and 1,843 million square yards respectively,while th-j Japanese exports for the same periods were 1,222millions and 1,619 millions.     ;v7ool - Machinery activity in the woollen and worstedindustry has decreased during the month of December.   Th^prices obtainable for yarns in this country are out ofharmony with those ruling for wool and business in yarns is somewhat disappointing,   The., output of hosiery is still oneof  the brightest features, and the export of tops continuesto  be very satisfactory.
     Other Industries - The. building industry is- -still in avery depressed condition, and there is a further slight increase in the unemployment figures, which have now reached592,330.   House-building is now being largely held up untilthe present Housing Bill has become law.     The conditions in the chemical industry continue fairly satisfactory and sales during December have been markedlybetter, particularly in regard to heavy chemicals.   Theglass industry continues to improve.     The market for coal tar products has distinctly improved in particular, naphthalene is showing particular signs of activity.   There was a slight improvement at the beginningof December in the market for pharmaceutical chemicals.     Owing to the setting up of manufacture in this country,phenacetin, hydro-quinonc and resorcin have been removed fromthe list of chemicals exempted from duty under the Safeguard-ing of Industries Act.   Conditions in the soap, oils andkindred industries tended to improve slightly.     There has been a considerable increase in the number oftyres (other than those used on commercial vehicles) drawnby motor car manufacturers.   The demand for cycle tyres(other than replacements) has shown considerable improvement17*. the last few months, but there has been a decline in thedemand for motor cycle tyres.   The general outlook, however,indicates an improvement over 1932.     The Wheat Situation - Taking into account the carryingover at July 31, 1932, of 131 million bushels, the total supplies of wheat in Canada at the beginning of 1932-33amounted to 562 million bushels.   The total supplies available for export and carry over in the crop year 1932-33amounted to 432 million bushels or about 113 million bushelBmore than the corresponding figure for 1931-32.   At the end
of November the quanity of wheat available for export and carry over amounted to 311 million bushels compared with237 million bushels on the same date in 1931.     The exports of Australian wheat for the month ofDecember amounted to nearly 7 million bushels, or 1 million bushels more than for the corresponding month of 1931.     The United States of America have sufficient carry overeven if there was no winter wheat crop at all.   Theypersist in holding their supplies, and whilst the Farm Boardsay they will not sell,  it is reported that the new Presidentwill dissolve the Board when he takes over the Presidency inMarch.     Russia is not offering much and appears liXely to be practically out of the wheat market this season.     During the year 1932 the total imports of wheat intothe United Kingdom amounted to 105.6 million cwts. comparedwith 119.4 million cwts. for the year 1931.     Retail Trade - The money value of sales in Novemberdecreased by 1.9% as compared with the corresponding month of1931.   This is the smallest decrease which has been registered for 20 months.     In the non-food departments the sales increased by 4.3?Sin London (West), 4.2$ in London (Suburban) and      in theSouth of England.   These results compare with a fall of 4.65ain the North of England and 7.4$ in Scotland.     Taking departmental stores only, trade in November forGreat Britain shoved a small increase of 0.9% as comparedwith the corresponding month of 1931, while in the UnitedStates and Germany there were decreases of 20% and 9.3?srespectively.   Tho corresponding figures for the month ofOctober were decreases of 3.6 , 21% and 17.3$ respectively,-8-
     In London and the South of England generally, Christmastrade appears to have been more satisfactory than could havebeen anticipated and in some cases reached 1930 levels.     When the final results ara available it is likely thatthe money value of sales for London and the South will showa small increase, but as regards the Northern districtsthere may be a decrease in the neighbourhood of 6-8/-,     The value of the trade of the Co-operative wholesale society for the 4 weeks ended 3rd December as compared withthe corresponding period of last year showed a slight increase of 0.7 ,     Finance;- (a) London.  The payment of the War Debt instament on December 15th was partly responsible for a generalrestriction in financial business and it is unlikely that anynoticeable improvement will take place until after thepayment in February next of the final instalment of 40;^ onConversion 3fj loan.     Sterling exchange has been very firm since the middle ofthe month, and it is believed that there has been a largeinflow of foreign funds.     The decision of the South African Government to abandon the gold standard has had a good effect on sterling exchanges and may prove to be a change of major importance.   It may,for example, be expected to ease the burden on South Africanexporters and ultimately bring profit to British traders whohave been materially affected by the lessened-&quot; purchasingpower of the South African agriculturalists,               (b) France. At present there is no sign of any improvement In the aoonomic or political position of France.     The fall of the Herriot Ministry, following the refusal cjthe Chamber to vote the payment of the December  instalment  ofthe American debt, has  caused a distinct flight of capital fro:
 France, and has &quot;been partly responsible Tor a reversaJ. of ^the-* trend of the exchange.           (c) Germany,   Since the advent of the new Schleicher Government there has been a slight improvement in trade and a reduction in unemployment.   Increasing confidence in the German economic position combined with German buying are regarded as being mainly responsible for a very big rise in the price of German fixed interest bearing securities.      It is estimated by the Institute for Market Research that Germany&apos;s capital repayments abroad during 1933 will amount to only RM.200 to 300 millions, as against RM.500 to 600* miliions- for 1932.           (d) United States.   Although the wave of despair of the early summer has been largely dissipated there are no^ indications of any expansion above the normal in trade and industry in the near future.   There are, however,  a number.of disturbing points to record.   Steel operations have fallen to 14?5 of capacity.   Nine railroads have fallen into receiver- ship.   The proposed legislation designed to assist agriculture does not inspire confidence and it is estimated that there are $11,000 millions principal amount of farm mortgages          t outstanding.      The decision to submit Canadian wheat shipped to England via American ports to customs duties has caused much ill- feeling and made the Americans realise one way in which the Ottawa Agreements are affecting them.           (e) General.   Developments during the past month do not point to any material easing of the international financial situation.   The budgetary position of many countries is presenting difficulties and there are no evident; movements which may lead to the removal of the dislocation and uncertainty which exist in the foreign exohange marKet.   So far as this country is concerned, there has been no further deterioration of the trade position and reports from various                            -10-
trading  centres  speak of some increase of activity and of amore confident feeling with regard to the future.     Canadian Trade.   The volume&apos; of &quot;business,-- af-te-r&quot;seasonal-,.adjustment, was at about the same level as in the precedingmonth.     The index figure for the manufacturing industries showedonly a minor change.   Operations of the primary iron and steelindustry were more active,, the production of pig iron andsteel showing an increase on that of tho previous- month..  The.production of gold in the .fjjrs-t^jtexL months of 1932-was2,524,899 ounces (valued at about $52,194,000) compared with ,213,895 ounces ($45,765,000) in the same period of 1931.Imports of raw cotton amounting to 15,400,000 lbs. were greater than in any previous month of the year indicating atendency towards preparation  for increased operation intextile plants.     Imports, generally, showed an appreciable gain, being$37,769,000 in November compared with $37,095,000 in theprevious month, but exports showed a rather marxed declinebeing $46,621,000 compared with $57,160,000.   For the firsteleven months of 1932, imports and exports were valued at$424,000,000 and $459,000,000 respectively, compared with$588,000,000 and $563,000,000 for the corresponding period in1931.   Wholesale prices continued to fall, the index figure for November being 64.8 compared with 65.0 in October, and prices generally are now only slightly above the general levelof 1913.     Australian t-rade -  For the period July to November, 1932,trade (in Australian currency) was as..follows:-  Imports, 33,126,000 and  exports  39,581,000 compared with  23,197,000and  38,763,000, respectively, for the corresponding period in1931.                           -11-
     Vheat exports for the month of December,  1952?  amountedto 0,946,200 bushels,  compared with 5,975,835  for thecorresponding month in 1931.   Exports of flour,  however,showed a heavy decline, being 38,469 tons as compared with52,432 tons.   The exports of butter and eggs  continue toshow a considerable increase.     Indian trade - During the month of November the values of both imports and exports were greater than  in the previous month, but as compared with November, 1931,  exports  werenearly 1-f crores less while imports were nearly 2rj croresgreater.   During the period January-October,  1932,  imports and exports of private merchandise amounted  to 123 crores  and127 crores respectively,  the figures for the correspondingperiod of 1931 being 127 and 154.   Exports  of gold  werelarger than in any month since March, 1932.    The wholesaleprice index which had remained steady at 91  since August fellslightly to 90.   The prices of Indian commodities remained ata very low level, and so long as this continues there is little hope of any expansion in Indian imports.     (A Crore = 10,000,000 Rupees).     South American Trade -  In Argentina considerable damage has been done to linseed and other crops by  locusts, which are said to have destroyed all chance of a cereal  export season.     Exchange restrictions continue to create  difficulties for British companies in most countries.  The politicalsituation in Argentine, Brazil and Chile appears to  havesettled down but the financial position of the latter countryis difficult,.-, and efforts are being made to develop new industries.-12-
