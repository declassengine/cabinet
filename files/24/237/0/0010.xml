The  Bureau proposes  to  the  General  Commission  that  the  following programme of work  should be adopted to facilitate progress at the DisarmamentConference :     The  General Commission  decides that the future  work of the conference should be conducted  on the following lines,  the direction of the work being placedin the hands of the Bureau :                                     I.    The  aim  of the Bureau  should be  to organise  without  delay practicaldiscussion of  the following topics, with the object of framing a Convention orConventions embodying them so far as they are ultimately approved :     (1) A solemn affirmation, to be  made by all European States, that they will          not in any circumstances attempt  to resolve any  present  or future          differences between them  by resort to force.    (2) The immediate study by the continental European States with a view to          their  mutual security of  the possibility of reaching political arrange-          ments defining the conditions in which  each of them will  be entitled          to the co-operation of the other contracting States.    (3) The application of the principle that the limitations  on the armaments          of Germany and the other disarmed States shall be contained in the          same  Disarmament  Convention as that  which will define the limita-          tions  on the armaments of others, so that the articles in Part V of the          Treaty of Versailles,  which at present limit Germany&apos;s arms and          armed forces, and the corresponding provisions of the other Peace          Treaties, would be replaced by the Disarmament Convention as far as          the disarmed States are concerned.    (4) The application of the principle that the newly-expressed limitations in          the case of Germany and the other disarmed States shall last for the          same  period and be subject to the same methods of revision as  those          of  all other  countries;  and the embodiment in  the  Disarmament.          Conference of an undertaking on the part of the signatory States to          enter  upon negotiations  in  due course before  the  expiry  of  this          Convention with a view to concluding a new Disarmament Convention          for the purpose of further adjustment of armaments.    (5) The embodiment in the  Convention, as regards war material, of the          principle of qualitative equality, and the provision  for the  realisation          of such equality, if not immediately after its entry into force, then by          specified  stages.  The reduction of the armies of  the continental          European  States  to a  uniform general type of organisation would          have  to be considered  in this  connection.      6706   [8129]
