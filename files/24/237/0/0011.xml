this document IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT74TO BE KEPT UNDER  LOCK AND KEY.10(53).It is requested that special care may be taken to     ensure the secrecy of this document.COPY NOCABINET.,UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE COMMITTEE.MEMORANDUM BY THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER.1.   The Committee was constituted to  consider future  ofUnemployment Insurance and of assistance for  the unemployedoutside insurance and to frame recommendations.2.   They have had before them the Report  of  the RoyalCommissicn but for various reasons they do not consider theRoyal Commission&apos;s proposals with regard to unemployment assistance outside insurance oatisfactory.3.   Early in their proceedings they considered a memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer on  the  lines already broadlydiscussed in Cabinet but here a difference of opinion  manifesteditself in the Committee on certain important  questions ofprinciple and until they have ascertained  the views  of theCabinet on these questions of principle they  do not  feel  thatthey can usefully carry their discussions  further.4.   The proposals of the Chancellor of the Exchequer  involvethe setting up of a Statutory Commission t-o administer relief and they contemplate the transference  &quot;to that Commission  of theduties n*w falling on the Public Assistance Committees, asregards tLnmiciliary relief (except medical attention and treatment) and the duties -of the Ministry  ef  Labour  with  respectto transitional payments.   Under this plan there would be  a sharp distinction between those entitled te UnemploymentInsurance benefit and those not so entitled.   There would  beno $separation between the various classes  of  persons not entitled to benefit, all of whom would obtain relief on a needsbasis at the public expense through the medium of the  statutory commission subject to the same conditions.
5.   Although it is believed by the advocates of this planthat in fact there would be a saving of money in consequenceof the elimination of waste, that ir not the main groundadduced in its favour.6.   The argument for the plan may be put  briefly as follows.The Government recognise that under the conditions of to-days new situation has arisen.   We have to deal with a state of thing in which we must expect that a large number of men andwomen will remain without regular employment for.a very long period, some perhaps for life.  In these circumstancesprovision is required for giving to these people opportunities for education, training, voluntary occupation and recreation.7.   It is not possible to deal with such a situation bylocal effort.  Unequal treatment with consequent discontenthas been a feature of the last year&apos;s experience, finances oflocal authorities in the depressed areas are suffering fromthe strain put upon them and the political pressure upon local representatives which has been evoked and which wasvery marked at the last municipal elections threatens theefficiency of local government as a whole and renders it  moredifficult than ever to enlist the services of the mostcompetent administrators in voluntary public service.8.   The advocates of the Statutory Commission believe thatthe removal of the day to day administration of relief fromparty politics would be widely welcomed by the more thoughtfulmembers of all classes, and that the new angle of approach would be recognised as a more humane method and one more  in keeping with present day conceptions of the duty of thecommunity towards its less fortunate members than the old.9,   The Minister of Labour, on the other hand, takes theview that these proposals raise most serious constitutionalo
and political issues, in that they involve the withdrawal ofParliamentary and Ministerial control from the expenditure ofat least fifty or sixty million pounds a year, and in respectof a service concerned with the livelihood of not less than5,0005000 people whose needs are to be relieved by anindependent Commission and its staff of officials.    Membersof the House of Commons will be deprived of the right to callin question, by the normal constitutional methods,  thetreatment of their constituents by the Commission.    In theMinister of Labour&apos;s view,  this would be sitting on the safetyvalve and might provoke a dangerous explosion.   He holds thatministerial responsibility is the price of parliamentary government, and that if that is abandoned it will be a directencouragement to unconstitutional methods.   He is reluctant to acquiesce in the destruction of the machinery of PublicAssistance through Local Authorities which we reformed and re-established only three years ago.  He believes that the totalcost of the scheme owing to the attraction of large numbers ofnew claimants will be greatly increased unless the Commissionenforce a general standard more severe than public opinion islikely to accept, and that an inevitable result of the scheme will be that the total number of registered unemployed will beincreased by several hundreds of thousands.   He points outalso from his own experience that the suggested provision oftraining, voluntary occupation, etc., by the statutory commission, if made out of public money and developed on any considerable scale,,  will lead to friction and controversywith Trade Unions, and may easily create a situation in whichthe Government would be forced to intervene.10.  It is not proposed here to state the answers to these objections though answers will be made when the matter is discussed.  The statements in the preceding paragraphs show
the nature of the matter in dispute cn which the Cabinet  is asked to express its opinion.11.  Before any decision is given however it is essentialthat the Cabinet should have before it the possible alternative solutions if the Statutory Commission is rejected the Cabinet is not now asked to pronounce upon any of these alternatives but their presentation is necessary if thewhole subject is to be viewed in proper perspective.12.  Tiie proposal favoured by the Minister of Labour isthat the Public Assistance Committees should be retained  asthe machinery for assessing the needs of the unemployed whoare not in receipt of Insurance 3enefit, subject to general directions laid down by statute or by seme central authority;and he suggests that the directions, in so far as they arenot statutory, should be made on the advice of a strongStatutory Commission.   He leaves open the question of thescope of the scheme, i.e. whether it should include the wholeof the able-bodied, or those within the industrial field, or                                ionly the present transitional class, and he suggests thatthis question should be further examined before a decision is arrived at.13.  It is difficult to comment on this proposal while the vital question of the scope of the scheme is left open.It would however appear to be practically a continuance of present arrangements which were admittedly of a stop-gapnature and involve increasing difficulties which parliament and the country will expect to see removed.   Moreover, ifthe scope is restricted to those within the industrial field and a special code of rules for assessing relief is applied,as the establishment of an Advisory commission appears to imply, the proposal involves a reversal of the view adopted
   by the  Cabinet when  the  Transitional Payments  (Determination   of Needs)  Act  was  framed that it would be impracticable to   distinguish between  one  class of applicants for relief and   another, according as  the cost was met by the Exchequer or   local authoritieso   140  As an alternative to this proposal the Minister considers   that it would  be possible for relief to be administered by   local committees appointed by him and working under his   instructions.   This  proposal would leave the Public   Assistance Committees  still dealing with poor law cases.   15.  The minister  of Health has offered one other alternative,   which he would prefer  if the Statutory Commission were   rejected.   This would hand over the whole administration of   outdoor relief including what is now known as transitional   payment to the Public Assistance Committees who would in that   case have  to receive a further contribution from the Exchequer   to meet the additional cost imposed upon them,   16.  It remains to state that the position of  the Secretary   of State for Scotland  is somewhat different from that of the   English Ministers.  The  law in Scotland is different from that   in England and the practice also differs in many respects.   Accordingly the Secretary of State has made proposals intended   to meet the special  circumstances of Scotland but when  the   Cabinet has decided  the  question of principle  raised in the   preceding  paragraphs it  is  thought that it may be easier   for the Committee  to come to a  conclusion as to the best   method  of  dealing  with the  Scottish problem.                                  (Intld,) N.C,ury Chambers, S.&quot;,7.1.,   January 23rd,  1933.
