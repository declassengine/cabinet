THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT I 0 9            TO BE KEPT  UNDER LOCK  AND  KEY.            It is requested that special care may be taken to                ensure the  secrecy of this dooument.                                                    COPY 110.                     OA  BINE T.            UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE COMMITTEE.                     SECOND  REPORT.  1.     At their Meeting on the  25th  January last (Cabinet  5 (33) Conclusion  1) ,  the  Cabinet  had before them  our First Report in  the form  of a most  secret Memorandum  &quot;by the Chancellor  of the Exchequer (paper CP.  10(33))0  This Report  outlined the scheme for  the  setting up of a  Statutory Commission to administer relief, and the trans-  ference to  that Commission of the  duties  now falling on the  Minister  of  Health and the Local Authorities in regard  to public assistance (other than by   way  of medical  attention and treatment)s  and the  duties  of the Minister  of Labour in respect of transitional payments,    Tlie Report  also set out the objections which had been raised by the  Minister  of  Labour to  these proposals,  and indicated that  until the views of the Cabinet  had been ascertained on  the questions of principle,, the Committee did not feel  that they could usefully carry their discussions on matters  of detail further,  2.     The  discussion  at the  Meeting of the Cabinet above  referred  to was mainly concerned with the question of Ministerial  responsibilitys and  the Committee  were  invited to address  themselves  once more to this  problem in the light of the  Cabinet discussion^  and to submit  a  Second Report on the  subject containing inter alia information on five specific  points set out in  the  Cabinet Conclusion.  3.     In accordance with  this  re quest,  we have carefully  re-examined  the problem of Ministerial  responsibility in                                  -1-secret.
connection with the scheme for the Statutory Commission,and have had before us certain further  proposals which, inoar opinion, should meet the constitutional and political objections -which have been raised to the scheme.4.       The scheme for a Statutory Commission as drawnup provided -     (a) for ministerial responsibility in regard to supply,     since there would be approval and presentation to     Parliament by a Minister of an annual estimate for a     block grant to the Commission (with the ordinary     machinery of appropriation and audit).   This would     establish the same responsibility that there is at     present for the State contribution to public     assistance made in common with other locally administered     services through the block grant to Local Authorities     provided under the Local Government Act, 1929.     (b)  for ministerial responsibility in regard to     administration, to the extent that a Minister     (l) would answer questions in Parliament and have     power to obtain the necessary information from the     Commission, and (2) would lay the annual report of     the Commission before Farliament and deal with it     in any resulting debate.   It was also proposed that     the Report should be considered by a Select Committee     of which the Minister would naturally he a member.5.        These provisions established Ministerial responsih-ility in the matter of supply.   They did not, however,  establishit fully in the matter of the direct control of administration.In our view, provision for that purpose can most properly and effectively oe made in relation to authority to make  theregulations on whish the policy,  principles and general character of the administration of the Commission must  depend.
6tJ     \7S propose that the Commissioners should heunder an obligation to make regulations for the guidanceof their officials defining -     (a) the circumstances in which assistance may         he given, otherwise than in an institution the per-         iod for which;, the basis on which and the         conditions under which, it may be thus given?     (b) the cases in which such assistance is to         he given in kind or in money or partly in         one and partly in the other?     (c) the nature and amount of the work or         instruction which an applicant may be         required to perform or receive as a         condition of receiving assistance?   and     (d) the regulations for the preservation          of order which will govern institutions          under the control of the ComuiissionerSo7.     We propose that all regulations made by theCommissioners must be submitted to the  Llinister tobe either approved, disapproved, or amended by him,and that in addition, all the regulations mustbe laid on the Table of both Houses of Parliament.                          \8.     In cases where the regulations are approved bythe Minister they would be subject to the ordinaryprocedure of confirmation, unless annulled by resolution of either House within a prescribed period.90     In cases where the regulations are either dis-                           3.
approved or amended by the Minister3 an  affirmative resolution of both Houses would be required to securethat a regulation is made and for the form in whichit is made.   In such cases we contemplate that theregulations as originally submitted by the Commission,,together with the regulations as drawn up or amended by the Minister should be laid before Parliament.10o     In actual practice the Commission will nodoubt consult the Minister in advance before makingRegulations.     Vfhere the Commission and the Ministeragree on the subject matter of the Regulationsy nodifficulty arises and the Regulations will be laidbefore Parliament and will become operativein the absence of the passage within the prescribed period of an adverse Resolution    Where the Commissionand the Minister disagree on matters of minor importance?the differences will no doubt be found capable of adjustment after consultation,, and it will only be in very exceptional cases9 where the differences are of grave and fundamental importances that Parliament willhave to decide by affirmative Resolution procedurebetween the &quot;views of the Commission on the one hand andon the other hand of the Ministers or rather of the cabinets for the Minister would no doubt in such circumstances have obtained Cabinet approval for his policy.11.     A decision of Parliament against Ministers? andin favour of the Commissions would carry with it theusual constitutional consequences?   if  the decision was against the Commissions the Ministerial proposals would be corns&apos; operative.
12,   We turn now to the specific questions on whichthe Cabinet asked us for further information:(l)  What v/ill he the size of the Statutory     Commission?       We suggest that the Statutory Commission mightconsist of not less than three members, and not morethan five   It would not, of course, be necessary atthe outset to appoint the full number of Commissioners,     (2)  &quot;&quot;ill the Government or the Statutory          Commission decide, within the limits          of the Statute, such questions as the          scale of relief and the conditions of          relief (e,g. Means Test)?     (5)  In the event of a change in Unemployment          (e.g. a substantial rise or fall in the          figures), will the Government or the          Statutory Commission initiate any          consequential changes in policy or          administration?       We contemplate that such matters will he dealtwith by means of Regulations to be issued by theStatutory Commission.  Ministerial responsibility forthe Commission&apos;s Regulations will, in our opinion, be satisfactorily secured by our new proposals outlined above.(4)   Is the Government or the Statutory     Commission to work out the methods for     re-conditioning the unemployed       hearing in mind that, while everything     possible should be done in this respect,     safeguards must be provided against two     dangers, viz: - (i) such over-expenditure     as to break down our industrial system;     and (ii) making unemployment too popular?       We contemplate that it will be for the statutory commission to work out methods for re-conditioning theunemployed who have fallen out of Insurance,  though this
                                                             loowould not exclude the possibility if it were found desirableof leaving certain activities of this kind in the charge ofthe Ministry of Labour.   Safeguards against dangers of thekind referred to would, under our new proposals, he providedby Regulations to he issued by the Commission.     (5)  Will there be Local Commissions under          the Statutory Commission?     The answer is in the affirmative, if by &quot;LocalCommissions&quot; is meant the official representatives  responsible to the Statutory Commission, through whom it is proposed thatthe Commission should act in various parts of the country,  Inthe original scheme prepared by the Chancellor of the Exchequerthese representatives are called &quot;Assistant Commissioners&quot;.     There will be no question of local representatives(whether nominated by Local Authorities or otherwise)taking decisions as to scales of relief, etc: or exercisingany administrative functions.     It is, however, contemplated that the AssistantCommissioners will he assisted by Local Advisory Committees.It will be natural for these Committees to advise AssistantCommissioners regarding conditions in their locality, e.g.the course to be adopted in classes of cases of special difficulty referred to them.   It has also been suggestedthat bodies of this kind might act as arbitrators on questions arising between the. Local Authorities and theCommission.  It is also contemplated that suitable appellatetribunals should he set up  to deal with appropriate questions affecting the interests of  individuals.
