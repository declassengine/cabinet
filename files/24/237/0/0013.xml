(THIS DOCUMENT  13 THE PROPERTY  OB  HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY 15 GOVERNMENT).                                           COPY NO.SECRET.CP. 12( 33)                    CABINET                       INDIA.          Appreciation of the Political Situation     by the Government of India, dated 22nd January,     1933.          Circulated for the information of the     Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
     Confidential Appreciation of the Political     Situation in India dated 22nd January 1933,     issued on the authority of the Secretary of                State far India.          During the last month there has been littlematerial change in the political situation.   It  is yettoo early to estimate the reactions on public opinion in India of the decisions of the Hound Table Conference;views hitherto expressed in the press have been  onstereotyped lines, and pro-Congress newspapers haveeontinued to denounce the result as wholly unsatisfactory and illusory.  The more moderate view appears to be  thatjudgment should be suspended until the views of  HisMajesty&apos;s Government are made clear by the publicationof a White Paper.  This involves the disadvantage that,if there is any considerable delay, the spirit  ofhopefulness induced by the Conference may tend toevaporate.          One indirect result of the Conference  has  beena renewed demand for the release of Gandhi and otherCongress leaders and, in fact, for a general amnesty sothat a favourable atmosphere may be created for theintroduction of the new constitution.  The Liberals  whoput forward this demand are no doubt inspired by a desireto stand well with the one organised political party inthe country and to earn the credit for putting an end tothe &quot;repressive&quot; policy of the Government.  The demandassumes that the Congress leaders released from restraintwill show themselves more reasonable than they are at                                               present...
present or than they were when last released.   There  is,however, nothing either in the past experience or inthe present facts to suggest that Congress as  an organised body is prepared to co-operate to make the  newconstitution a success, and it would appear more probablethat, if Government relaxed their present policy,Congress would at once assume a dominating position which they would use for wrecking, not working theconstitution.  On the other hand, if Congress  is notrestored to any such position, the more moderateelements, which in some provinces are combining to formconstitutional parties, will have a reasonable chance ofasserting themselves at the first election, and if theyare returned to power, may be expected to work theconstitution reasonably.  There are also signs ofdivided counsels in the Congress camp and it is probablethat, by degrees, the more, moderate Congress elementswill split off from the extremists ana make every effort to gain power under the new constitution.   *      Meanwhile civil disobedience activitiescontinue to be negligible and efforts to reviveenthusiasm meet with little or no  success.  In  spite ofthis, the Congress Dictator, Kajendra Prasad, who haswithin the last few days been convicted  and sentenced toa term of imprisonment, has been reminding his  followersthat &quot;though removal of untouchability and attainment ofunity among  all communities in India  are  important and urgent items in the Congress programme,  they  are  not theonly items and cannot imply the  suspension  of  all theother activities of Congress and particularly  of the                                                  civil..
civil disobedience movement&quot;.          In striking contrast to this appeal is  thestatement recently issued by Gandhi  in reply to thosewho have consulted him on the question whether theyshould prosecute civil disobedience  or take  an active part in the movement against untalienability.  His reply, which is characteristically ambiguous, seems intendedto convey the impression that while  he is in jail he must no longer be regarded as the leader of  civildisobedience, responsible lor continuing it  or callingit off, ana that, if leaders outside choose  to concentrate on work of social reform, he will have noobjection.  He even hints that this  might be the  wiserpolicy.  Such a statement cannot fail tc be  embarrassing to other leaders who are anxious to  keep up  the  dwindlingspirit of their followers and it is  significant  that  theCongress press have so far paid no attention to  this statement,  They doubtless regard it as damaging  to theircause and trust it will soon lapse into oblivion.          The opposition to the campaign to  secure forthe untouchable classes the right ox entry to temples isgradually becoming stronger and Government have beenconfronted with a difficult problem as to the action whichthey should take in regard to bills of which notice hasbeen given both in Madras Legislative Council and theAssembly; the orthodox party contend  that the billsprofoundly affect their religious beliefs and customs andthat if sanction is given by the Governor-General to their introduction and discussion, Government will be abandoning the position of non-interference to which they are pledged                                                    in....
in all religious matters.  On the other hand,  if no opportunity is given even of discussing these  proposals in a constitutional manner,  the Congress,  who  are taking up this question largely for political purposes, willbe presented with an excuse for organising direct actionagainst custodians and trustees of temples,  which maylead to serious disturbances.   Those not fully acquainted with Indian conditions will also charge Government withopposing an attempt to remedy an admitted evil, thoughsuch a criticism overlooks the point that the  improvementof the position of the depressed classes is primarily a social and economic problem and may, in fact,  be littleadvanced by spectacular activities connected with templeentry.   It is possible that the effect of bringing thismatter into the forefront of the political stage may beto make conservative orthodox section of Hindusrecognise that they must fight their own battles andthat under the new constitution they must cease to relysolely on the protection afforded by the BritishGovernment.  Discussions of a question of this kind which rouses strong feeling, may have the indirectresult of bringing home to a large section of thepopulation the implications of a democratic constitution.The Congress party may also find their political influence decreased by the split which they have  caused in the ranks of Hindus who form the bulk of their party.Meantime, Mr.Gandhi, who had threatened a fast  on thissubject, to start on 2nd January, has found occasion to postpone it.          The situation in Burma is still uncertain; thedecision of the Legislative Council was purely  negative;                                                    it. . .
it opposed the separation of Burma on the  constitutionoutlined by the Prime Minister.   It opposed alsounconditional and permanent federation of  Burma with india.  In effect, therefore, the responsibility for  adecision has been passed back to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.  In districts,  the position is obscure;some reports of further preparations for rebellion havebeen found groundless but in some districts there appears to be a good deal of political activity and thesituation is being carefully watched by Local Government.          On 15th January judgment was delivered in theMeerut case and 27 out of 30 accused have  been convicted of the offence of waging war against the King.Attention in the press is focussed on the  long duration of the case which started in June, 1929,  while theNationalist press comments on the severity of the sentences.  The importance of the case thus tends to  be overlooked.  The Sessions Judge has found that theCommunist International in Russia aims at  bringing about a revolution or revolutions for the  overthrowingof existing governments by means of armed risings andthe establishment of Soviet Republics in their places;,that India was selected as a suitable field for their operations as being one of the most likely places forthe next step forward for world revolution;  that themethods included incitement  of antagonism betweencapital and labour and the creation and development of organisations superficially  for the benefit of  their members, but in reality worked for the purpose  of promoting the communist programme; and that accusedtook part  in this conspiracy, which aims  at depriving                                                  the...
the King of the sovereignty of British India.   It is satisfactory that, by this decision, a conspiracyfraught with gravest dangers to the well-being of india has been stopped at an early stage.  It is even moreimportant that it has been held that these activities which might be regarded by some as harmless or evenbeneficial have been revealed by the trial in  theirtrue light as an attempt to overthrow by revolutionarymethods the Government established by law in India.
