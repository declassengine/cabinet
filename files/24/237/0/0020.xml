THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT To the Rt. Hon.  Neville Chamberlain,       Chancellor  of the Exchequer.    1.   BY Minute dated 12th May, 1932, we were appointed to be a Committee with the following terms of reference :        &quot;To enquire into the present position of Co-operative Societies   in relation to the Income Tax and  to report whether any  modifi-    eation of that  position is desirable  and,  if so, what alterations of    the law are required for the purpose.&quot;   2.   We have taken evidence in writing from the Board of Inland Revenue, from  representatives  of the Co-operative  Societies,  from trading organisations and from  organisations representative of the interests of taxpayers generally, and we have also examined witnesses orally  upon  the written evidence.  A list  of the bodies from which evidence has been taken is given in the Appendix to this Report.   3.   Some of the witnesses suggested that, if the  method of the Income  Tax  should  not be  thought suitable  for the purpose  of obtaining from the Co-operative Societies their appropriate contributions- tion towards the  revenue of the State, our  terms  of  reference  were wide  enough to  empower  us  to consider  the  application  to  the Societies of  forms of taxation other than  the Income Tax,  such as a tax on turnover.  We decided, however, that the terms of reference did not admit of  such  an  interpretation and we  have limited  our inquiry accordingly.   4.   The  position  of Co-operative  Societies  in relation  to  the Income Tax  has  previously been the  subject of  public inquiry and was considered by the Departmental Committee on Income Tax (the Ritchie Committee)  which reported in 1905 (Cmd.  2575),  and by the Royal  Commission  on the Income Tax  which  reported  in  1920 (Cmd.  615).   The Departmental Committee, whose original terms of reference had been extended to embrace an  inquiry as to  &apos;&apos;  whether Co-operative  Societies  enjoy under   the  present  law any undue exemption  from liability to Income Tax,&quot; reported that no case had been made out for an alteration of the law.   The Royal Commission, however,  found that,  &quot;notwithstanding  the decision of  the 1905 Committee,  dissatisfaction with  the measure of exemption extended to Co-operative Societies continued to find expression in  the Press and occasionally in Parliament&apos;&apos;;  the Co-operative  movement had grown  rapidly and it  was &apos;&apos; evident that this dissatisfaction  (chiefly on the part of private traders) has been accentuated by the high rate of Income Tax now in force.&quot;  The Royal Commission took evidence afresh  and made recommendations which, briefly, were to  the effect that &quot;a society   should  be  treated  exactly as  a limited  liability company trading  in similar  circumstances  and under similar condi- tions,&quot; but  there was a  substantial body of opinion on the Commis- sion  which   did  not  agree  with  the  recommendations.   Therecommendations  of  the Royal Commission  did not  pass  into law; the  growth of the  Co-operative movement has continued; and, upon the  evidence  we have received, the trader to-day feels strongly  that the  Income Tax position is unfair.   5.  Co-operative  Societies  are liable   to  Income  Tax  under Schedule A in respect of land.and buildings owned by them, whether in their own occupation or let  to tenants,  and  under Schedule  B in respect of land  in their own occupation.  The  question of  exemp-tion arises  in relation to Schedules C and  D, which  between themcover  trading profits and income from Government  Stocks,   deben- tures,  mortgages,  bank  deposits, shares  or  loanB in  other Societies and stocks and shares in limited liability companies, &amp;c.CONFIDENTIAL.REPORT.
    6.   A Society which is registered as an Industrial and ProvidentSociety (and we understand that practically all Co-operative Societiesare so  registered)  is specifically exempted  from Income Tax underSchedules C and D by Section 89 (4) of the Income Tax Act, 1918,unless it sells to non-members and the number of its shares is limited by its rules or practice.  Apart from this specific exemption, accordingto one  view of the Income Tax law as  interpreted by  the Courts, aSociety would still  not be liable to  Income Tax in respect of a surplusarising from transactions with its own members.  The Board of InlandRevenue have stated that  they are advised that, &quot; in the light of thedecisions of the Courts in regard to mutual trading, the surplus arisingfrom transactions by a Co-operative Society with its own  members can-not be regarded as a profit for Income Tax purposes.&quot;  On the otherhand,  it has been urged  that this conclusion is not to be inferred fromthe decisions  in  question.   The arguments  on either side have beenvery fully stated to us and  it is clear that the point is by  no means free from doubt and could be settled finally only by a Court of law.    7.   One typical feature of Co-operative trading is the &quot; dividend &quot;or &quot;divi.&quot;  (in order to  avoid  confusion with dividends on shares weshall refer to it as &quot; divi.&quot;), and it will be convenient to consider thissubject before dealing with other aspects  of the problem.    We  will consider it primarily in  relation to Societies engaged in retail trade.Members,  on  making purchases from the  Society,  receive tickets orvouchers stating the amounts of their purchases.  At the end of eachquarter or  half-year the  Society  prepares  an account showing theresults of its operations for the  period and out of any surplus available,and sometimes  also  out of reserves  carried  forward from  previousaccounts,  distributes a &quot; divi.&quot;  to each purchaser proportionate to theamount of his purchases, as shown by his tickets or vouchers. Non-members also usually receive a &quot; divi.&quot; on their purchases, commonlyat half the rate of that paid to members.    8.   The Board of Inland Revenue stated in their  evidence that&apos;&apos; the  &apos; dividend&apos; on purchases is not taxed as  income in the hands ofthe recipient, the distribution being regarded as, in effect, a reductionin the  price of the goods purchased corresponding to a trade discount,which would be allowed as a trading expense in dealing with the  liability to tax of a company selling the  goods.&quot;    9.   It has been contended  by some of  the traders&apos; witnesses whogave evidence before us that the &quot;divi.&quot;  is not in  the nature of a discount or a rebate on the purchase price,  because the rate of  &quot; divi.&quot;is not determined, and the &quot; divi.&quot; is  not paid, until after the surplusfor  the  relevant period has been ascertained, whereas a trade  discountis fixed at the time of purchase.   To our  mind the point of  time atwhich the &quot; divi.&quot; is determined and paid is no more than incidental tothe  particular mode of operation of the Societies and does not affect theessential nature of the allowance ; and we agree with the view expressedby the  Royal Commission on the Income Tax in paragraph 551  of theirReport  that the transaction of purchase and sale is  not to be regardedas really completed until the Society has paid the &apos;* divi.&quot;    10.  A further consideration which has been put before us is thatthe  &quot; divi.&quot; is. calculated by reference to the whole of the surplus  andnot  by reference to the surplus  on the particular article or articles pur-chased by the  recipient of th^ &quot; divi.&quot;  A  &quot; divi.&quot; may be allowed inrespect of a purchase that has-been  made at, or even below, cost price,the  source of the payment being a surplus on articles bought above cost price by other purchasers  or even surpluses accumulated before the purchaser became a member.   It cannot be denied that a  purchasermay in such circumstances receive an allowance which is in no sense a return  of his own money, but we do not think that this has any  bearingupon the question whether the  &quot;divi.&quot;  corresponds to  a discount orrebate.  An ordinary trader may allow a discount on articles which hesells at, or below,  cost price, but it would not be suggested  on that account either that the discount should be disallowed as a  trade expensein computing  his trading profits for Income Tax purposes or that itshould be treated as income in the hands of the purchaser.    11.  &quot; Divi.&quot; on  purchases  is also paid by the wholesale societies and is  essentially the same as  that paid by the retail Societies.   In
the case of certain other Societies which are engaged in selling the produce of their members, &quot;divi.&quot; takes the form of a bonus on theamount purchased from  the member.  Here again we are of opinionthat the  time  factor is only incidental and  that  the  bonus  is in essence an increase  in  the price  originally paid to  the member  forhis produce.   12.  Our conclusion  is therefore that, in relation to the Societypaying it,  &quot;divi.&quot; is a  trade expense:  in  relation  to the  recipient.it is a reduction of the  cost to him of the goods purchased from theSociety, or an  increase  in the price obtained  by him for  the goodssold to the Society,  as the case may be. It follows that, if the costor sale price of  the goods enters into a  trading  account of the recipient, the amount to be brought in  for  Income Tax purposes isthe  cost price  as reduced, or the  sale  price as increased, bv the&quot;divi.&quot;   18.  The present position in relation  to the  Income  Tax  isusefully illustrated by  the following broad comparison, set out inthe evidence of the  Board of Inland Revenue, between the liability of a Society and that of an ordinary trading company : 	Society.

The Board of Inland Revenue go on to point out that, &quot;sofar as the income is distributed as dividends or interest on shares,interest on loans, &amp;c, it is in both cases fully taxed by reference tothe personal liabilities of  the individual investors.&quot;  The companydeducts  tax  from  the dividends  or interest  and  an  appropriaterepa3&apos;ment is made by the Inland Revenue to the individual investorif he  is entitled to relief by reference to his personal circumstances,while the Society normally distributes in full without  deduction of tax and the individual  investor  is  charged by  direct assessment.After stating that the &quot; divi.&quot; is regarded  as a reduction in the priceof the goods purchased,  the Board further observe that &quot;it is onlyin respect of the undistribided  income that there is any  effectivedifference between the  Society  and  the  company.   The  companybears tax at the full standard rate on the  whole of its income whichremains undistributed.   The  Societies pay  tax  under  Schedules Aand B only,  and the tax so borne by them is, over the whole field,far less than tax on  their undistributed  income  (including  undis-tributed surplus  from mutual trading) at  the standard rate.&quot;    15.   The sums  paid out by  Societies as  dividends or interest onshares and interest on loans  and  deposits are  taxable by  referenceto the personal Income  Tax liability of the investor.   There  is noquestion as to  that.  Our problem is to determine whether and, if
BO, to what extent the undistributed income or surplus of  Societiesshould be taxed.    16.   The undistributed income  or  surplus of Societies may  be derived from any or all of the following sources :    ; (a) trading with members;    (b) trading with non-members;    (c) investments falling under  Schedules C and  D of the Incomeid)  property or the occupation of land falling under Schedules  AThe problem  centres  in  (a).  It is  contended by  the Co-operativeinterests that this source,  in the case  of  a Co-operative  Society,cannot, of  its very nature,  yield a proper subject  for  the charge of income Tax.   This contention has  no application  as regards  (b),(c)  and (d),  for  it is admitted  that  the trading  of Societies with non-members  is  ordinary commercial  trading, and income arisingfrom (c) and  (d) can assume no special character because it happensto be received by a  Co-operative Society,  although in  fact incomearising  from  (c)  is exempted  from Income Tax  by Section 89  (4)of the Income Tax Act.  1918, whereas  income arising  from (d) is liable to tax.    17.  As regards trading with members, it is contended  that  the societies are  associations of  citizens  formed  to  carry  on  tradingamongst themselves in order to effect the most economical spendingof their incomes.  &quot; It has  always  been clearly recognised,&quot;  say  theParliamentary  Committee  of  the  Co-operative  Congress  in  their evidence, &quot;that the surpluses created by this mutual  association donot and cannot constitute a taxable profit.&quot;    18.  Certain decisions of the  Courts are quoted in support of  this contention.  As we have stated  in paragraph 6 of this  Report,  theinterpretation of these decisions is not  free  from doubt.  We  aregrateful to the witnesses who have analysed them  for  our  benefit,for it was  necessary  that we should inform our minds as to  the bearing on our subject of any principles that have hitherto prevailed.But the interpretation of the existing Income Tax  law, even if itwere not a matter of  dispute, could  not  decide the  question for  us,because we are required, if we think fit. to recommend alterations of the law.    19.  The basic idea  of  the view that &quot;mutual&quot;  trading,  or atany rate some forms  of  &quot;mutual&quot;  trading,  cannot give  rise to ataxable  profit is  that  a  man cannot make  a profit out of himself.The owner of an article  cannot  make a taxable  profit by selling itto himself  at a higher price than he paid for  it.  Again,  approachingsomewhat  more closely to the position of a Co-operative Society, ifa number  of persons combine to purchase in bulk an article whichthey all require, each contributing to a common fund for  the purpose,and the article is found  to cost  less than had been anticipated  andthe excess  contributions  are  returned pro  rata to  the contributors.a contributor cannot be said to have received a taxable  profit in  theform of the excess of his contribution over the actual cost of his shareof the article bought.    20.  Co-operative Societies may  have originated in  associationsapproximating to a simple combination of this type, but the position ofis registered under the Industrial and Provident  Societies  Act is anincorporated body, and it is clear from judgments of the  Courts, sincethe Royal Commission reported in 1920,  that an incorporated body isa legal entity  apart from its members.   The existence of this entityseems to us to be a matter which cannot be ignored in considering whether  there is  true  mutuality of trading,  or  not.   If any real&quot; mutuality &quot;  existed we should expect to find a situation in  which thecontributor (in this case the member qua purchaser) retained as con-tributor an individual interest in his excess contributions.  We do not -find thaJt.:  A contributor cannot point to  any part of the  undistributed *surplus  on trade with  members  as representing his contribution  andclaim a  right  to dispose of that part of the surplus.  &quot;And even if the tax;and B.A Society which
alienation of the particular contribution from the particular contributorcould be disregarded, and it were argued that the undistributed surplusis at  least  at  the disposal of the members as a body, the purchaseracting as one of the body of members still cannot exercise over any partof the undistributed surplus a greater degree of control than attaches tothe vote to which as a member he is entitled.   He may be outvoted byother members, and in any case, if the general  rule is, as we imder-stand, that each member has one vote, his  voting  power bears norelation whatever to the amount of his contribution.    21.  We are unable to see any reasonable  ground for holding thatthe undistributed surplus derived from  the trading of a  Society withits members should be exempted from Income  Tax by reference to thenature of the source from which it arises.  We agree with the view ofthe Royal Commission on the Income Tax in  paragraph 556 of theirReport that a true trading profit does result from the trading of the societies both  with members and with non-members.    22.  As we  have  remarked  in  paragraph 16, the nature of the source has no bearing on the question  of the exemption from tax  ofother component parts of the undistributed income or surplus.   Theonly  other  consideration in  regard to  which exemption,  or partialexemption, could be suggested is the status of the members of Societies,who may be mainly below the Income Tax limit or liable only at the reduced rate.  We are again faced with the fact that a separate legalentity the  Society is interposed between the income or surplus&apos; andthe members, and in our opinion the existence of that entity cannot, aswe have already stated, be ignored,  any  more than the existence of anentity separate from the shareholders in the case of an  incorporatedcompany.   Income Tax at the full rate has to be paid on  the undistri-bnted profits of a company irrespective  of the  individual liabilities  ofthe shareholders, and there must  be  many  companies in  which aconsiderable body of the shareholders are not individually liable  atthat rate.   28.  We feel that we should deal specifically with one argumentused  by the traders.   They contended that  the operations of the societies were causing a gradual elimination of the small trader, and thereby driving out of the Income  Tax  field persons who were liableto pay such tax.  To this the reply of the Co-operative interests was,inter  alia, that the elimination of the small trader was due as much(if not more) to the increasing number of multiple shops and depart -mental stores.   With this reply we agree and our recommendation&apos;;have not been  influenced by this argument of the traders.   24.  We wish  also  to make it  plain that we have  regarded asirrelevant to our inquiry any representations  as to the economic,social or political value  or activities  of  the Co-operative movement.   25.  Having regard to the evidence  we have received and to the considerations we have set out, we recommend  :     (a) that  Co-operative Societies  should be  charged to  Income  Tax          in respect of  all trading, whether  with members or with          non-members, the charge being computed (subject to our          recommendation in paragraph 26) in accordance with the          ordinary  provisions as to  allowable  expenses,  wear  and          tear,  &amp;c,  applicable under the Income Tax  Acts in the          case of corporate bodies carrying on trade;    (b) that  the &quot; divi.&quot; should be treated as a trade expense;  and   (c) that  the statutory exemption granted by Section 89 (4) of the          Income Tax Act,  1918,  should be  withdrawn.   26.  We have not overlooked the fact that if, under the general provisions of the Income Tax Acts  which would be  applicable if therecommendations in  the preceding  paragraph were followed,  taxwere  deducted  at the source by the  Societies from interest paid,  acertain degree of hardship to the  recipients would be entailed,  andthe Revenue would be put to the expense of dealing with  a verylarge  number  of repayment claims.  The Board of  Inland Revenueobserve in  their evidence, however,  that this  difficulty could &apos;* be completely  met by a  provision. that Co-operative Societies-(unlikecompanies)  should  make  their  distributions of  interest  without
(&apos;)deduction of Income Tax, the recipients being  directly  chargeablein accordance with their individual liabilities,&quot; and we recommendthat such provision should be made.   The Societies should then be relieved from tax equivalent to that which they would otherwise havebeen entitled to deduct and retain.   27.  We are informed by the Board of Inland Revenue that theyestimate that on the basis  which we recommend  the Societies wouldhave paid for the  year 1931-82, by reference  to the trading resultsof 1980, about  1,000,000 more Income Tax  than  they in fact paid for that year,  and that for the year  1982-88, by reference  to  the trading results of  1981, the corresponding figure  might be  in  the region of  1,200,000.   In arriving at these figures  &quot; divi.&quot; has been allowed as a  trade expense of the Societies,  and  any estimates of probable future yield would require to take  into account the possi-bility of Societies deciding to increase the rate of &quot; divi.&quot;   28.  In order to carry out our  recommendations legislation wouldbe necessary to withdraw from Co-operative  Societies  the exemptiongranted by  Section  89 (4)  of the Income Tax  Act,  1918, and, inview of the doubt  referred to in  paragraph  6 of this Report as toliability  under general Income  Tax  law in  respect of  a Society&apos;stransactions with its own members,  it would  be  advisable to imposesuch  liability  by  specific  enactment.   Legislation  would also  benecessary to give  effect to the recommendation  contained  in para-graph  26 of this Report.    29. In  conclusion, we desire to  express our gratitude  to  ourSecretary, Mr. C.  H. Wakely, for  his invaluable  assistance.  He  hashad no  easy task,  but has been unsparing in his work  for  theCommittee, and we are glad to put on record our great appreciation of his services.                          W.
