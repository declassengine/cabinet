his  document  is  the  property  of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s GovernmentECBET .:.P.  21  (33)cabinet copy NoCHILDREN AND YOUNG PERSONS (CONSOLIDATION)  BILL.    Memorandum by the Home Secretary.          This Bill was placed first among the Consolidation Billsincluded in the classified list of Bills proposed for thepresent Session which was before the Cabinet on the 12th october last (Cabinet Conclusions 52(32),  Conclusion 6).          The object of the Bill is to consolidate the children and Young Persons Act of last Session with the unrepealedprovisions of the Children Act, 1908, and other enactmentsdealing with the protection of young people.   The Act passedlast Session made a large number of detailed amendments in theexisting enactments, and unless a consolidation Bill is passed into law before the amending Act of 1932 is brought intooperation considerable inconvenience and confusion will be experienced by all concerned with the administration of theseenactments.   While the amending Act was under considerationby Parliament last Session, the Government spokesman statedthat a consolidation Bill would be introduced at the earliest opportunity;  and as the amending Act is to be brought intooperation on the 1st April next it is important that the consolidation Bill should now be introduced without delay.          The Bill is purely consolidation, and raises of courseno questions of policj&apos;-.   It is a Bill which might suitablybe introduced in the House of Lords.   The Bill will be ready for introduction in the course of the next few days, and Ishould be glad to have the authority of the Cabinet to introduceit in the Lords as soon as it is ready.J .GiOm OFFICE:      6th February,  1933
