Committee on the Total!sator on                Greyhound Racing Tracks..             Memorandum hy the Home secretary.      In accordance with the request made by the Cabinet at their meeting on the 26th instant  (Cabinet Conclusions 4(33) Conclusion 1),  I circulate, for consideration by the Cabinet, alternative draft statements in the form of replies to Parliamentary Questions.      Both drafts, which have been prepared with the assistance of the  Secretary of State for ;-ar, are based on the assumption that, as regards tote clubs, every step will be taken to secure their suppression and that, if necessary, legislation to extend the scope of the existing law will be introduced if it is found that the  existing law is inadequate for this purpose.      As regards the use of the totalisator on greyhound racing tracks, Draft &quot;A&apos;f proceeds on the basis that the Government will not  come to v final decision as to the legislation, if any, which may  be necessary to deal with the use of the tote  on  these tracks until they have had an opportunity of studying the final recommendations of the Royal Commission with regard to other forms of betting.  Draft &quot;3&quot; is based on the assumption  that the Government decide to announce a decision to give effect, by legislation if necessary, to the  interim recommendations of the Royal Commission with a view to bringing to an  immediate end the use  of  the  totalisator on greyhound tracks.   I  also circulate an alternative draft &quot;C&quot; prepared in the Home Office  on  the same basis as Draft &quot;/.&quot;,  but explaining at greater  length  the reasons for  postponing a final decision with  regard to  the use of  the totalisator on greyhound  tracks  and stating definitely that, whatever policy may  ultimately be adopted by  the Government when they have made a comprehensive review of the  whole problem in
the light of the  finfl  recommend ftions of the Royel Commission,there can be no question of giving  legal sanction to thecommercial exploitation of the  totalisator on these tracks,J. G.lOME OFFICE:   30th Jenufry,  1933.
               DRAFT   &quot;A&quot; .     Draft Question and Answer on the assumption that theGovernment propose to announce their decision to suppresstote clubs but will not come to a final decision as to theirattitude with regard to the use of the totalisator ongreyhound racecourses pending the final Report of the RoyalCommission.QUESTION;        To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department   whether the Government have considered the recommendations of   the interim Report of the Royal Commission on Lotteries  and   Betting, and what decision has been reached with regard  to the   use of  the totalisator (a) in clubs and (b) on greyhound racing   tracks.AKSHER?        Yes, sir.   As regards the use of the totalisator in tote   clubs the Government accept the recommendations of  the Royal   Commission who were impressed by the spread of the  organised   facilities for betting and gambling and of the habit  of  betting   and gambling.    They clearly state that the use of  totalisators   for transactions, which In their view are  in substance betting   transactions,  whether in clubs or on greyhound tracks, leads  to   an enormous growth of facilities for continuous betting  and to   an inoreasing  exploitation of the gambling instinct of the   population at  large by persons for their own financial gain.   Regarded from this point of view, the totalisator appears to   the Commission to be a grave social danger, and their unanimous   recommendation is that totalisator betting both in  clubs and   on greyhound tracks should be brought to an end as  soon  as   possible.        The Government are advised that the use of the tote in   olubs is illegal under the existing law as interpreted by the
Courts, and they propose to put into force the lav; with a vie?/to the suppression of these clubs.   Should changes in the methodsof conducting betting operations through the totalisator in theseclubs be adopted, and should it be found that the existing law is inadequate to deal with them, the Government will introduce any legislation which may be &amp; und necessary to effect the completesuppression of these clubs.     As regards the use of the totalisator on greyhound racingtracks, the Government are advised that this also is contrary tothe existing lav/, and the Government propose that the law asinterpreted by the Courts should be enforced.   The government recognise that, as pointed out by the Royal Commission, thefacilities afforded by the totes are only one form of the bettingfacilities provided on these tracks and that the Royal commission will be dealing in their final Report with the general question ofbetting facilities on these tracks.   The Government do not proposeto come to a final decision as to the legislation, if any; whichmay be necessary to deal with the use of the tote on greyhoundtracks until they have had an opportunity of studying the finalrecommendations of the Royal Commission with regard to other forms of betting.   When those recommendations are received theGovernment will be in a position to review the matter in all its aspects.
DRAFT  &quot;B&quot;     Draft Question and. Answer on the assumption that theGovernment propose to announce their intention to c;ive effect,by legislation if necessary, to the recommendations of theRoyal Commission in respect of the use of totalisatorc both intote clubs and on greyhound racing tracks with a view to bringing to an immediate end the use of the tote in these places oQUSSTIQJ ; To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department    whether the Government have considered the recommendations    of the interim Report of the Royal Commission on Lotteries    and Betting, and what conclusions they have reached with    regard to the use of totalisators in tote clubs and on    greyhound racing tracks.ANSWER:        Yes, Sir.  The Government have carefully studied    this Report and accept the recommendations of the Royal    Commission who ware impressed by the spread of the    organised facilities for betting and gambling and of the    habit  of betting and gambling.  They clearly state that    the use of totalisators for transactions, which in .their    view are in substance betting transactions, whether in    clubs  or on greyhound tracks, leads to an enormous growth    of facilities for continuous betting and to an increasing    exploitation of the gambling instinct of the population    at large by persons for their own financial gain.    Regarded from this point of view, the totalisator appears    to the Commission to be a grave social danger and their    unanimous recommendation is that totalisator betting both    in clubs and on greyhound tracks should be brought to an    end as soon as possible.
     The Government are advised that the use of thetotalisator in tote clubs and on greyhound racing treoksis illegal under the existing law as interpreted by thedecisions of the Courts, and the Government propose thatthe law should be enforced.  Should changes in the methodsof conducting betting operations through totalisators beadepted, and should it be found that the existing law is inadequate to deal with them, the Government will introduceany legislation which may be necessary to bring to an end the use of the totalisator in these places.
                   DRAFT   &quot;G&quot; .     Draft Question and Answer on the assumption that theGovernment propose to announce their decision to suppress toteclubs hut will not come to a final decision as to theirattitude with regard to the use of the totalisator on greyhoundracecourses pending the final Report of the Royal Commission.QUESTION:        To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department   whether the Government have considered the recommendations of   the interim Report of the Royal Commission on Lotteries and   Betting, and what decision has been reached with regard to the   use of the totalisator (a) in clubs and (b) on greyhound racing   tracks.ANSWER:        Yes, sir.   The Government have given careful consideration   to these matters in the light of the recommendations made in   the interim Report of the Royal Commission on Lotteries and   Betting.        The Royal Commission were impressed by the spread of the   organised facilities for  betting and gambling and of the habit   of betting and gambling.    They clearly state that the use of -totalisators for transactions, which in their view are in substance   betting transactions, whether in clubs or on greyhound tracks,   leads to ah enormous increase in the facilities for continuous   betting and to an increasing exploitation of the gambling   instinct of the population at large by persons for their own   financial gain.   Regarded from this point of vie1.;, the   totalisator appears to the Commission to be a grave social danger,   and their unanimous recommendation is that totalisator betting   both in clubs and on greyhound tracks should be brought to an end   as soon as possible.   The Commission reserve for their final   Report the general question of betting facilities on greyhound
                            -2-                           120tracks other than by means of the totalisator together with thequestion of totalisator hotting otherwise than in tote clubsand on greyhound tracks.     In the Government&apos;s&quot;view the greatest importance attaches to the considered and unqualified conclusions reached by theCommission on the evidence submitted&apos;to them, and unless itcould bo shown that weighty considerations of public policy ledto some other conclusion the Government feel that there wouldbe no justification for failing to give effect to the recom-mendations of so impartial and independent a body.     As regards tote clubs , the Government fully accept the viewof the Royal Commission tnat the social mischiefs resulting fromthese clubs, whether conducted on a cash or credit basis, arcclear and undisputed, and the case for their immediatesuppression appears to have been fully established.   TheGovernment are advised that the activities of these clubs as atpresent conducted are illegal under the existing lav.- as inter-preted by the Courts and it will be the duty of tho authorities responsible for enforcing the law to take steps at once to bring these activities to an end,   Should changes in the methods of conducting betting operations in these clubs be adopted, andshould it be found that the existing law is inadequate to dealwith thecij the Government will introduce legislation extendingin necessary the scope of the law so as to make impossible thecontinuance of these clubs.     As regards the use of the totalisator on greyhound racingtracks, the question at issue is complicated by the fact thatthe facilities afforded by the totalisator are only one formof the betting facilities provided on these tracks.   Tho RoyalCommission has expressly reserved its findings on the general question of betting facilities on greyhound tracks apart fromthe uso of totalisators, and the Government have decided thatit will not be expedient to attempt to deal comprehensively withthe problems connected with these tracks until they have had an
1 ?1X W Xopportunity of studying the conclusions and recommendations which will shortly be submitted by the Royal Commission on other aspects of the problem.   It should however be clearly under-stood that whatever policy may ultimately be adopted when thiscomprehensive review takes place, there can be no question ofgiving legal sanction to the commercial exploitation of thetotalisator.   !Nor pending the receipt and consideration of theRoyal Commission^ final Report,  can there be any question of introducing any legislation whatever on tne subject.   In themeantime the existing lav; as declared by the Courts must been forced.
