THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  February 1933.SECRET.                                                Copy No. 39CP.  16 (33).CABINET.POLICY  IN PALESTINE.           Memorandum by the Secretary  of State far the  Colonies.     1.  IT has become necessary to take decisions on certain important questions relating to land policy  in Palestine.  The problem with which we have to deal may be stated quite simply.   The Jews have for years been buying land in Palestine for  agricultural colonisation.   This is part of the fundamental policy of Zionism, and is likely to continue so long as funds are available, and land can be obtained.  The Jews pay market prices to Arab landowners,  and in many cases generous compensation to tenants and other occupants, who are  displaced from the land purchased.     2.  In former years when one Arab  sold land to another,  the landowner changed,  but  the  tenants remained,  and those  who  laboured on the land for regular or seasonal wage still continued to  earn that wage.  To some extent this practice was.  and  is, maintained by such organisations as the Palestine Jewish Colonisation Association. But  the Zionist Policy is different.  When the Jewish National Fund purchase land, not only the  landlord is changed, but the  tenants and all the wage-earning labourer class are compelled to move; for the  Zionist policy is  not  only to acquire ownership, but  also to ensure  that all  the  work required on the land shall be carried out by Jews only.  The right of the Zionists- to take such action cannot be questioned, but it obviously creates a new situation for the Arab cultivator.     3.  The  result is the  growth of a body of  &quot; landless&quot;  Arabs,  who may be divided into three classes:          (a) Tenants.         (b) Small owner-occupiers.         (c) Labourers.  * In a more highly-developed country, one  might expect such persons to  be partly absorbed into  other occupations, and the  remainder dealt with by the Poor Law Authorities, but conditions in  Palestine are  peculiar.  The  fellah is  usually heavily in debt, improvident and unfitted for urban life.  Political exploitation, which  is active in Palestine, tends to  create in the &quot; landless &quot; class a feeling of disaffection and unrest.   Sir Arthur Wauchope is definitely of opinion that this constitutes a potential danger, which should be arrested without delay, if  serious consequences are to be averted.    4.  The attention of the late  Government was drawn  to this problem by the Report of the Shaw Commission on the distmdoances of  1929 (Cmd. 3530,March 1930), and by the report of Sir John Hope Simpson (Cmd. 3686, October 1930).  In the  Statement of Policy of October 1930 (Cmd. 3692)  and in the PrimeMinisters  letter of the  13th February,  1931, to Dr. Weizmann,  His Majestys Government accepted responsibility for the resettlement of such Arabs as could be shown  to have been displaced from the lands which  they occupied,  in conse- quence of those lands passing into Jewish hands, if they had not obtained otherholdings or other satisfactory occupation (paragraph 9 of the  Prime Ministersletter).  They also  accepted generally Sir  John Hope  Simpson&apos;s proposal for       [8152]               &apos;       &apos;                                b
making further land  available for Arabs (including Arabs already &quot;landless&quot;)and Jews, by means of a comprehensive development scheme; and they contem-plated that, in connection  with this development scheme, which would  involvea  guaranteed  loan of  2-J- million, the Government of  Palestine should takelegislative powers to control dispositions of land which would be sufficiently wideto protect  Arab  cultivators for the future.  In the  meantime, full power wasreserved (paragraph 12 of the Prime Ministers letter) to take all steps necessaryto protect the tenancy and occupancy rights, including the rights of squatters,throughout Palestine.    5.  In August, 1931, Mr. Lewis French was appointed Director of Develop-ment  for the purpose of     (a) Preparing a  register of &quot; landless&quot;  Arabs;    (b) Drawing up a scheme for the resettlement of those Arabs; and    (c) Investigating the methods  to be adopted to give effect to the policy of           land settlement adumbrated in the White Paper of 1930, and. in the           Prime Ministers letter.                 ,    6.  Mr. French presented a report to  the High Commissioner in December1931,  and  a supplementary  report  in  April  last.  These reports  have been communicated in confidence to the Jewish Agency and the  Arab Executive, whoseobservations upon them are at present awaited by the High  Commissioner.  Ithas been publicly announced in Palestine, with my concurrence, that no decisions will be taken upon the French reports until His Majesty&apos;s Government havereceived and considered the  High  Commissioner^ recommendations,  togetherwith the observations  of the Jewish Agency,  and the Arab Executive.    7.  A summary of Mr. French&apos;s proposals is appended (Appendix II). Thereports contain     (a) Estimates  of- the  cost  of  resettling  an Arab  family  on   &quot; dry &quot;           (unirrigated) land  for extensive  cultivation, and on irrigated land           for citrus  cultivation, respectively; based on the assumption that the           Government of  Palestine will undertake the necessary works  of land           improvement, and  will equip the  settlers and  maintain them during           the early years.  Mr. French estimates that the cost would be  500 per           family for &apos;&apos; dry &apos;&apos; farming, and  650  to  800 for citrus growing.    (b) A  general survey  of  the  land resources of the  Territory, and  of the           possibility of making further land available for intensive cultivation,           by means of irrigation, drainage,  &amp;c.    (c) Proposals for the enactment of somewhat drastic legislation, designed to           provide security  of  tenure for the  Arab   cultivator;  viz.,  an           &quot;Occupancy Tenants&apos;  Ordinance,&quot; which would  confer an  &quot; occu-           pancy right&apos;&apos; on existing and future tenants, thus preventing their          eviction,  and  a  Homestead Protection  Ordinance, which  would          prevent the owner-occupier or the &quot;occupancy tenant&quot; who wished          to dispose  of his land or  &apos;&apos; occupancy tenancy &apos;&apos; from parting with a          minimum  &quot;homestead area.&quot;    8.  Mr. French has now resigned, and his place has been taken by his deputy,who was formerly a member of the Palestine Administrative Service.  There is reason to believe that  Mr. French&apos;s reports will be received with hostility  by bothArabs and  Jews, and  that  any proposals based upon them will be the subject of acute  controversy.                   ^    9.  Apart  from  this,  it  is necessary  to take  into account the  change of conditions since the policy of the late Government was formulated in 1930.  Thispolicy contemplated a development scheme, to  be financed out of a guaranteedloan  of  2^  million,  and   Parliament  was  informed  (see Appendix  I,paragraph  11)  that, during the first years of the development scheme, it wouldbe necessary to provide from British Votes  such annual amounts  as  might berequired to meet the interest and sinking fund charges upon  the loan.  Thoughthe financial and economic condition of Palestine shows signs of improvement,world economic conditions  remain uncertain,  and financial stringency at home isstill acute.  For  these reasons, I consider  that there is ample justification for postponing the initiation of any large scheme of development in Palestine, andthat we should  now  reconsider our commitments in the light of the changed
conditions, and determine how far we must go towards meeting them, and how itis to be done.    10.  If the proposal for a development scheme is shelved, we are left with two urgent problems, which call for immediate action :      (a) What  should  be done  as  regards Arabs  who  have already become           &quot;landless&quot;?    (b) How can  the process of displacement be stopped?As regards (a),  the pledges given by His Majesty&apos;s Government were very definite.The claims of &apos;&apos; landless &quot; Arabs are actually being accepted for registration atthe  present time,  and any  indication that His  Majesty&apos;s  Government do not intend to carry out their undertaking to resettle them would have a  deplorablepolitical effect,  which would be exploited to the  full by the increasingly  activeArab  Nationalist Party, and by the Communists.  The register  of &quot;landless&quot;Arabs is nearly complete, and it is estimated that the total may amount to some800 or  900  families.   This figure takes no account  of owner-occupiers,  or of arab   villagers  who  have  hitherto worked  as  labourers  for Arab  land-owners, but who  will find their means  of  livelihood vanish when both the ownership of the  land  and the work on  it becomes  Jewish in  place of  Arab.Sir  Arthur Wauchope holds, and I  agree with him, that wre are only  pledged todeal with &quot;landless&quot; Arabs, in the sense of  those who have  lost  their landthrough Jewish  action, i.e.,  tenants.  For financial reasons, if on no  other grounds, the Palestine  Government cannot undertake,  in addition, to settle onthe  land, at a cost of perhaps  500 each, those Arab owner-occupiers, who havevoluntarily sold their land, or Arab villagers, who have lost, not land-holdingsbut their employment upon the land as a result of Jewish land purchases.   It is,however, necessary that the existence of the labourer class  (estimated at some3.000  families)  should be recognised.    11.  I wash to inform the High  Commissioner that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment  concur with his views as to  the  limitation of the register to displacedtenants; and I propose to ask him  to submit  his  own recommendations for providing land  for the 800 or 900 families who are likely to be registered, with due regard to  economy.   It  may  be found unnecessary to provide for  this -settlement on such a costly scale as is suggested in Mr. Frenches reports.  Forexample, it is hoped that the Wadi Hawareth Arabs, whose settlement  constitutes the  most urgent problem, will be settled at a cost of  about  250  per  family; inthis case the land is obtainable at an  exceptionally low price,  and  the  Arabsalready possess tents, agricultural implements and ploughing animals, items forwhich Mr.  French allowed  110 to  120.    12.  I am afraid we must recognise that even this limited plan of re-settle-ment  will probably involve a guaranteed loan.  This being the case it would, inmy opinion, be  desirable to provide facilities by  means of the same loan for the financing of certain  urgent public works in Palestine.  The provisional list ofthese  works, of which  the  greater part are revenue-producing, or  will  effectsavings in  annual expenditure, include the provision of married quarters forthe  infantry garrison, an oil berth  for  the Iraq  Petroleum Company at HaifaHarbour, town  water supplies and improvements  of the  telegraph and telephonesystems.    I  should like to have  approval  in principle for  such a loan,  which, inconsultation  with the  Treasury,  I  should  endeavour to  keep  within  suchlimits  as  would  be  likely  to obviate any call  on  the Exchequer   under theguarantee.    13. I  have not overlooked the  fact that the Prime Ministers  letter  and dr.  Shiels&apos; speech contemplated that, if funds were available, some  assistance would be given  to Jewish settlement, and that this was confirmed  by Sir arthur wauchope  in  statements  which he  made, with my  approval,  to  the  ArabExecutive  and the Jewish Agency on the 27th January, 1932 (see Appendix I,paragraphs  6, 8-10).   These undertakings were, however, expressly  dependentupon  the initiation of a development scheme; and if, for the reasons given inparagraph  9, the development scheme is postponed,  we are,  I consider, free to confine action to the re-settlement of  &quot;landless&quot; Arabs.      &apos;[8152]                                                      n 2
    14.  At the same time it will probably be found necessary on economic andpolitical grounds  to provide on the Palestine Estimates  for  a  government contribution to the  Jewish Agricultural Research  Station.    It will  be noted(Appendix II, paragraph 6) that Mr. Prench&apos;s reports contain  a recommendationof this nature.    For  the   same  reasons  the  High  Comissioner  urges  strongly  thatthe guaranteed loan should include provision for a  capital grant of  10,000 or 20,000 to a definitely Jewish institution (agricultural or educational).  Further,the High Commissioner desires to include provision  for the capital cost, roughlyestimated at  60,000, of a Technical School, which he regards as one of Palestine&apos;s most urgent needs.  This school  would be open to both Arabs and Jews, and itis understood that probably it would be used mainly by Arabs, but it would also beof benefit to the Jews.  I should be glad to receive approval in principle for theseproposals.    15.  With regard to (6), in view of the high cost of resettlement, it is obviousthat, for financial  reasons, quite apart from the question of policy and the preser-vation of order in Palestine, the  process of displacement should be brought to anend as soon  as  possible.   I have  discussed   the  question  fully  with sir Arthur Wauchope and I  am satisfied that there is no half-way house betweenleaving things as they are and so aggravating the evil, and  some form of legis-lation  to control  land transactions.   I am also  convinced that,  in  view of theopposition  of the  Jews to  legislation of this  nature, any new enactment shouldnot transgress any of our commitments to the Jews and should  involve as littleinterference as possible with the economic life of the country.    16.  Reference  has been made  in paragraph  7  above  to the  restrictivelegislation proposed by  Mr. French.   Sir Arthur  Wauchope considers,  and I agree with him, that these ordinances go too far.   We agree that  the  right ofa tenant to a holding sufficient for the subsistence of his family must be assured,but, in conformity with the proposal not to register owner-occupiers as &quot; landless &quot;Arabs,  we consider  that the right of  the owner-occupier to  sell  his land should remain unrestricted, at any rate  for the present.    17.  It has already been noted that in paragraph 12 of the Prime Minister^letter full power was reserved (pending the establishment of temporary centralisedcontrol of land transfers  in connection  with the  development  scheme)  to take all steps necessary to protect tenancy and occupancy rights,  including the rightsof squatters, throughout Palestine.  In accordance with this policy, a temporaryOrdinance with a life of 12 months was enacted on the 28th  May,  1931, whichamended the Protection of  Cultivators  Ordinance, 1929,  in  several importantparticulars.  The life of the amending Ordinance was extended for a further12 months on the 28th May, 1932.    18. The present Protection of Cultivators legislation provides as follows :      (1) No tenant of two  years&apos; standing, who has paid his rent and cultivated           his  holding properly  and not been declared bankrupt, may be evicted           without at least one  yea,r&apos;s notice, compensation  for  disturbance and           for improvements and (if he is of more  than five years&apos; standing and           goes without an  eviction order) the equivalent of  one year&apos;s average           rent.   Any dispute regarding the amount of compensation has to be           decided by a Board consisting of  a District Officer,  one representative           of the landlord and  one representative  of the tenant.   The Board&apos;s           decisions require confirmation^ by the District Commissioner.     (2) Unless there has  been  failure to pay rent or to cultivate properly, or           unless the tenant has been  declared bankrupt, the court will not grant           an  eviction order unless  the  High  Commissioner is satisfied that           &apos;&apos; equivalent provision has been secured  towards  the livelihood of the           tenant.&quot;    (The Ordinance does  not specify  what this &quot; equivalent           provision &quot; must be.)     (3) The tenanfs rent cannot be  raised  except  with the consent of a Board           constituted as above.     (4) Tenants who have not paid their rent and have not cultivated their land           properly may be evicted at 15 days&apos;  notice unless  they apply for the           matter to be referred to a  Board constituted as above.
    19.  Sir Arthur. Wauchope tells me that, since the amending Ordinance came into force, few, if any, tenants have been turned off their lands.  No case has been referred  to the High Commissioner under (2) above, and, therefore, no evictionorders can have been made except after default in regard to payment of rent, orproper cultivation, or after bankruptcy.  At the same time the Ordinance does not provide complete security, since it merely impedes, but does not prevent, eviction,and allows of compensation in other forms than land in the case of eviction.    20.  The  most important  parts of  the existing legislation expire in May,1933,  and some legislation will, therefore, be necessary in any case within the nextfew  months.   Sir  Arthur  Wauchope&apos;s  proposal  is that  the  Protection  ofCultivators  legislation should be made  permanent, and that  the  opportunity should be  taken to  simplify  it and redraft  it.   The legislation  would  be&quot;permanent&quot; in the sense that the  time-limit  would be  removed, but the ordinance would be subject  to review in the event of the establishment of thecentralized land control contemplated in the Prime  Ministers letter.    21.  The  revised Ordinance  would contain the following provisions :-     (1) A tenant who has paid his rent and not neglected his holding grossly may          not be evicted  unless the High  Commissioner  is  satisfied that  an          equivalent provision has been made for him in  land up to the minimum           required  for subsistence of himself and his  family,  and  unless he is          given at least one year&apos;s  notice, compensation for disturbance and for         -  improvements and,  if of more than 5  years&apos;  standing,  the equivalent          of  one year&apos;s average  rent.    (2) A tenanfs rent not to  be  raised except with  the  consent  of a Board          constituted as at  present.    (3) A tenant who has not paid his rent not to be evicted without at least one          year&apos;s notice and compensation for improvements, and even then not           to  be evicted  from  the  minimum area required for  subsistence          provided he cultivates it fairly.   *(4) Any question as to what  is a sufficient subsistence area for  any particular           tenant to be settled by a Board constituted as at present, and liable           to review, say, every 5 years.    (5) A Board to decide, as at present, all questions regarding  the amount of           compensation due.    (6) A tenant to be allowed  to  sell or mortgage his tenancy interest in the           &quot; subsistence area.&quot;    (7) The following clause, taken from  Mr.  French&apos;s Occupancy  Tenant&apos;s           Ordinance:                &quot; Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in  this Ordinance, the           District  Commissioner  may, on  the application  of  the landlord,           authorise  the resumption by  him  of a holding or part thereof, upon           being  satisfied (1) that such resumption is required for some reason-           able and sufficient purpose having relation to the good  of the holding           or  of the  adjoining  lands,  including development by drainage or           irrigation  or by  closer  settlement or colonization  or disposal for          building  purposes;  and (2) that the &apos; occupancy tenant&apos;  will retain           sufficient land in the district or elsewhere for the maintenance of him-           self and his family, or that the purpose for which the resumption of the          holding is sought comprises the provision for  the &apos; occupancy tenant  &apos;          of  developed land sufficient for the maintenance of himself and his           family, together  with adequate  subsistence  for them pending the           development of such lands.&quot;    22.  Sir Arthur Wauchope is definitely of opinion that no  legislation should at present be  passed preventing  the  owner-occupier from disposing  of his land.He considers that it would be difficult to justify such an interference with theright of  landowners to dispose of their property, and that the inclusion of the   *  Note. Sir Arthur Wauchope. proposed to lay it down that the  minimum area to be reservedshould be  such as to provide the tenant with subsistence by his existing methods of cultivation.I would prefer that the Ordinance should leave the determination of the &quot;  subsistence area &quot; ineach case  to the  Board, in order to allow of a reduction of this area hi cases where the landlordmay be prepared to irrigate the land and to provide for the tenanfs subsistence  in  the meantime.
owner-occupier in the proposed  legislation would be likely to strengthen theopposition to anything which it may be decided to do for the tenant.   He doesnot anticipate, at any rate during the next few years,  a serious problem arisingfrom the conversion of owner-occupiers into &quot; landless &quot; Arabs.    23.  I am in agreement with the High Commissioners views on the subjectof preventive  legislation, and  I  should like to  authorise him to prepare and.subject to my approval, to pass a draft Ordinance embodying the provisions whichhe suggests.    24.  It remains to  consider whether the line of action proposed in  thismemorandum affords any substantial ground for  complaint on the part  of theJews.  It is true (see Appendix I, paragraph 3)  that His Majesty&apos;? Governmenthave stated that they regard a development scheme as the most effectual means offurthering the establishment of a National Home for the Jews.   But it can fairly be contended that the  change which has  taken place in  financial and economicconditions since that  statement was  made would  afford  ample justification for postponing the development scheme, and with  it&apos; any expenditure on Jewishsettlement.   As  regards the  resettlement  of  displaced  Arabs, this  is  an obligation of His Majesty&apos;s  Government  which  has already been recognised bythe Jews.  The Jewish Agency have had an opportunity of examining the case ofeach applicant for  inclusion in the register of  &quot; landless &quot;  Arabs before finaldecision, and the Prime Ministers letter and the published  instructions  to theDirector of Development contemplate the resettlement of these Arabs on comple-tion of the register, irrespective of  the initiation of any wider scheme of landsettlement.    If preventive legislation is confined as proposed above to a strengthening ofthe Protection of Cultivators Ordinance, it can be justified as falling within the reservation already quoted from paragraph 12 of the Prime Ministers letter, andthe Jews will have  no  grounds for claiming that any such legislation should be dependant on the initiation of a development scheme.    25.  I ask the  Cabinet to approve     (a) that there shall be no new development scheme  at present  (paragraph 9);    (b) that  the register of &quot; landless &quot;  Arabs  shall be limited to ex-tenants          (paragraphs 10-11);    (c) that the High Commissioner shall be instructed to prepare and submit          plans for re-settling &quot; landless &quot; Arabs registered in accordance with          this definition (paragraph 11);    (d) that the cost of re-settlement of &apos;&apos;  landless &apos;&apos; Arabs and of certain urgent          public works shall be met out of a guaranteed loan (paragraph 12);    (e) that the High Commissioner shall be authorised to meet Jewish demands          for  some equivalent  treatment by  granting a  contribution  from          Palestine Government funds to Jewish research, and by including in           the  guaranteed  loan  provision  for  a  contribution  of   10,000 or           20,000  to  a Jewish agricultural or  educational institution and for           the cost, estimated at  60,000, of a Technical School (paragraph 14);    (/) that the Protection of Cultivators Ordinance shall be amended on the          lines set out above (paragraph 21);    (g) that  no restriction shall be placed on owner-occupiers in disposing of          their land  (paragraphs 16 and 22).    26.  If  this line  of  action meets  with approval, I  will discuss with sir Arthur Wauchope the steps to be  taken to  give publicity,  here and inPalestine, to the decisions of His Majesty&apos;s Government.    27.  Appended to this memorandum  are :              Appendix  I. A statement of the commitments of His Majesty&apos;s                 Government.             Appendix II. A  summary  of   the   proposals   contained  in                 Mr. Frenclvs reports.                                                                 P. C.-L.    Colonial Office, Downing Street,         February 1, 1933.
APPENDIX  I.                Commitments of His Majesty&apos;s Government.    I.   &quot; LEGISLATION is to be introduced with the object of controlling the disposition of agricultural lands in such a manner as to prevent the dispossessionof the  indigenous  agricultural population.  These  temporary measures  will besuperseded in any  case  by such  permanent enactments as may be decided uponwhen  future policy  is  determined  in the light of  Sir John  Hope Simpson&apos;sReport.&quot;    (Paragraph  5  of  Statement  with regard to  British  Policy  inPalestine, May  1930, Cmd. 3582.)    2.   &quot; .... It is, however, an error to imagine that the Palestine Govern-ment is in possession of  large areas of vacant land which could be made availablefor Jewish settlement.   The extent of unoccupied areas of  Government  laiid  is negligible.  The Government claims considerable areas which are, in fact, occupiedand cultivated by Arabs.  Even were the title of the Government to these areasadmitted, and it is in  many cases disputed, it would  not  be possible to make these   areas  available   for   Jewish  settlement,   in   view  of  their   actualoccupation by  Arab cultivators and  of the  importance of making availableadditional  land on which to place the Arab cultivators who are now landless.&quot;(Paragraph 15  of  Statement of Policy by His Majesty&apos;s Government,  October1930,  Cmd. 3692).    3.   &quot; We may proceed to the contention that the Mandate has been  reinter-preted in a manner  highly prejudicial to Jewish  interests  in the vital  mattersof land settlement and immigration.  It has been said that the policy of theWhite Paper would place  an embargo upon immigration,  and would suspend,if not, indeed, terminate, the close settlement of the Jews on the land, which is a primary purpose of the  Mandate.  In support of this contention particular stresshas been laid upon the passage referring to  State  lands in the White Paper,which  says that &apos; it would not be possible to make these  areas available forJewish settlement  in view  of their actual occupation  by Arab  cultivators, andof the importance of making available  additional land on  which to place theArab cultivators who are now landless.&apos;    &quot;  The language of this passage needs to  be read in the light of the policy as a whole. It is desirable to make it clear that the landless Arabs, to whom itwas intended to refer in the passage quoted, were such Arabs as can be shown to have been displaced from the lands which they occupied in consequence of the lands passing into Jewish hands, and who have not obtained other holdings onwhich  they can establish themselves or  other equally satisfactory occupation.The number of  such displaced Arabs must be a matter for careful enquiry. It isto landless Arabs within  this  category that  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government feelthemselves under  an obligation to facilitate  their settlement upon  the land.The recognition of this obligation in no way  detracts from  the larger purposesof development, which His Majesty&apos;s  Government regards as the most effectualmeans of  furthering the establishment  of a  National Home  for the  Jews.&quot;(Paragraphs 8 and  9  of letter from the  Prime Minister  to  Dr. Weizmann,February 13, 1931.)    4   &quot;  It is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to institute an  enquiry as soon as possible to  ascertain, inter alia, what State and other lands are,  orproperly can be made, available for close settlement by Jews under reference tothe obligation imposed  upon the Mandatory by Article  6 of  the Mandate. this enquiry  will be comprehensive in  its scope,  and will include the whole landresources of Palestine.   In  the conduct  of  the enquiry, provision will be madefor all interests, whether Jewish or Arab, making such  representations as itmay be desired to put forward.&quot;  (Paragraph 10 of Prime Ministers letter.)     5.   &quot;In giving effect to the policy of land settlement  as  contemplated  in article 11 of the Mandate, it is necessary if disorganisation is to be avoided, and if the policy is to have a chance to succeed, that there should exist some centralised control of transactions  relating to the acquisition  and transfer of land during
such interim period as may reasonably  be  necessary to place the development scheme upon a sure foundation.   The power contemplated is regulative and notprohibitory, although it does involve a power to prevent transactions which are inconsistent with the tenor of the scheme. But the exercise of the power will belimited  and in no respect  arbitrary.    In every case  it will  be  conditioned by considerations as to how best to give effect to the purposes of the Mandate.  Anycontrol contemplated will be fenced with due safeguards to secure as little inter -ference  as possible with the free transfer of laud.  The centralised control willtake effect as from  such a date  only as the  authority charged with the duty ofcarrying out the policy of  land  development shall begin to operate.  The  HighCommissioner will, pending  the establishment of such  centralised control, have full powers to take all steps necessary to protect the tenancy and occupancy rights,including the rights of squatters, throughout Palestine.&quot;    &quot; Further, the statement of policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government did not imply a prohibition of acquisition of  additional land by Jews.   It contains no such-prohibition, nor is  any such intended.    What  it does contemplate  is such temporary control of land disposition and transfers as may be necessary not toimpair the harmony and effectiveness of the scheme of land settlement to be under-taken.  His Majesty&apos;s Government feel bound to point out that they alone of theGovernments which have  been  responsible  for the administration of Palestinesince the acceptance of  the Mandate have declared their definite  intention to initiate  an active  policy  of development  which it  is believed  will result  insubstantial and lasting benefit to both Jews and Arabs.&quot;  (Paragraphs 12 and 13of Prime Ministers letter.)     6.   &quot; . . .  . the proper  application of the absorptive capacity principle.That principle is vital to any scheme of development, the primary purpose of whichmust be the settlement both of Jews and of displaced Arabs upon the land.&quot;(Paragraph 15 of Prime Ministers letter.)     7.   Lord Passfield&apos;s despatch to the High Commissioner for Palestine, datedthe 26th June, 1931, regarding the development scheme, lays upon the Director ofDevelopment the duty, inter alia, to prepare  a  register of displaced Arabs as defined in the Prime Minister&apos;s letter and to draw up  a scheme  of re-settlement for registered displaced Arabs.  The despatch goes on to say that when the scheme has been approved by the High Commissioner, re-settlement will be carried out as quickly as possible.   (See  paragraph 5, iii  (6), of the  despatch.)     This despatch was  published at the time and has been reproduced in theAnnual Report on Palestine for 1931.     8.   &quot; The scheme is intended  in the first  place to provide for those &apos; land-less &apos; Arabs who can be  shown to have been dispossessed as a result of laudpassing into Jewish hands, and any balance will be  available  for both Jewishand  Arab  settlement.&quot;    (Dr.  Shiels&apos; speech in House of  Commons  on the 17th November, 1930.)     9.   &quot; While it is not  possible for him  at this stage to say anything definite about the provision of funds for development purposes, he could tell them  that the object which His Majesty&apos;s  Government had in view was to take early action, if financial circumstances  permit, to  put into operation a scheme of development. limited in its  scope, providing  first for the re-settlement of Arabs  ....  and second  for some assistance  to Jewish  settlement in  Palestine.&quot;  (Report of Sir Arthur Wauchope&apos;s  speech to Arab Executive and Jewish Agency on  the 27th January,  1932.)     10.  &quot; His Excellency said that the direct  deduction from  the instructions he had  received was that if a loan was sanctioned then a portion, though what portion he  did  not know, of the funds would be devoted for the benefit of Jewish settlement.&quot;     &quot; Flis Excellency said he imagined  that the first duty of the Development Commission would be to  re-settle a number of displaced&apos;Arabs;  but  that did not mean that a portion of the funds should not be spent simultaneously on objects that would be for the benefit  of Jewish  interests.&quot;  (Report of Sir  Arthur Wauchope&apos;s  statement  to  Chairman  of   Jewish Agency  Executive  on  the 27th January,  1932.)
    11.  &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government have come to the conclusion that to achieve the object  in view itis necessary to provide for  an expenditure not exceeding 2,500,000, a  large part of which would be  devoted to works of a productivecharacter  .... namely, irrigation, drainage and other schemes;  . .  .&apos;  -.  In viewof the present financial situation in Palestine, the only way in which a sum ofthis magnitude can be provided is by means of a loan under the guarantee of HisMajesty&apos;s  Government.  During the first years of the development scheme it willbe necessary  to provide  from  British Votes  such annual amounts  as  may berequired   to  meet the  interest and  sinking fund charges  upon  the loan.&quot;(Dr. Shiels in  the House of Commons on  the 17th November, 1930.)APPENDIX  II.     PALESTINE DEVELOPMENT.Summary of Mr. French&apos;s Proposals.1.  Landless A arabs.             Claims received        ...       ...       ...    3,700             Claims examined by 1st April    ...       ...    1,367           *Claims finally accepted...       ...       ...       72           *Claims provisionally accepted   ...       ...       80             Claims rejected        ...       ...       ...      648    As regards the total number of claims which will be eventually accepted,Mr.  French  cannot  give  a  closer estimate  than  between  1,000  and  2,000.(N.B.-The latest estimate is 800 to 900 families.)2. Proposals  for settlement of Arabs.    (a) Not  more  than 100  or  200 families can be settled within the nexteighteen months on  such limited areas of &quot; dry &quot; lands (for cereal farming) as arelikely to be available.  Estimated cost   500 per family.    (b) Any  further settlement must be on irrigated lands for intensive farming(i.e., citrus),  and might cost as much as  800 per family.  This must be a verygradual process, depending not only on the results of enquiries into the questionof available  land,  but on  examination of the  important question  of  marketprospects  for Palestine citrus  fruits.3. Facilities of Jewish Colonisation.    The only possible areas are         (a) The coastal plain;        (b) Beisan;        (c) Huleh;  and        (d) A portion of the Jordan Valley.    The Beersheba  district would also  have possibilities, if boring investigationsnow in progress result in the  discovery of adequate artesian supplies of water.    (a)  The coastal plain is being actively developed for citrus fruit growing,and present  progress is as rapid as circumstances warrant,  having regard to market  possibilities.   &quot; The dangers  to Palestine of a collapse in  the  citrusindustry must be foreseen.....If the bottom falls out of the citrus growing-industry, there is no evidence  that it  can be replaced by any other reasonablyprofitable product.&quot;    (b), (c), (d) If these areas  should be found technically capable of irrigation,and if then capable of  producing  economic crops, they would allow, of resettle-Government  of landless  Arabs  and colonization  by  immigrant  Jews  by  gradualdevelopment over a series of years;  but the crucial question of markets wouldhave . to  be  considered.   &quot;There  would  be no  justification  for  incurringconsiderable expense in opening up new areas so long  as it remains in  doubt               * These claims nil emanate from Wadi  Hawareth Arabs.      [8152]                                                         c
whether foreign markets will be able to absorb all the fruit that is being and is capable of  being  produced  in  the  coastal  plain,  where  water  is  readilyobtainable.&quot;4. Hydrographic Survey.    A hydrographic survey of the whole country was recommended in the first report, and, as part of this survey, it is proposed that preliminary surveys ofthe Beisan, Huleh and Jordan Valley areas should be undertaken as a first step.Cost of hydrographic survey,  8,000.5. Immediate^ aid to Jewish organisations in work  of colonization.    The  Jewish Agency considers  that assistance  for consolidation  of  coloniesalready founded would not be an appropriate method of applying developmentfunds.  Mr.  French agrees that  the intrusion of Government into the  internal economy of colonies existing or in progress of establishment would be undesirablefrom  every aspect.    As an alternative the Jewish Agency have submitted proposals for a JewishAgricultural and Settlement Bank.   Mr. French analyses this proposal and showsthat such  a bank would have to charge a higher rate of interest than  the settlerscould pay, and that the result would be an annual loss to the Government.   Anannual charge  of   60,000 for 40 years would be  imposed upon the Palestinetaxpayers.  &quot;Palestine is  predominantly  agricultural,  and  to impose  extrataxation  on  agriculturists  generally, in  order to  provide uneconomic credit facilities  for a limited number, would be manifestly  unfair.&quot;    (Mr.  French considers that  the only  purpose  for which  the Governmentwould be  justified in providing long-term credits for Jewish agriculture, wouldbe the improvement of holdings for  the purpose of securing a larger net return from  land.  He does not think that there is any need at present for the provisionof such facilities.)6. Government  contribution towards cost  of Jewish  Agricultural Research        Station.    Mr.  French  proposes that  the  Government  should contribute  a  sum  of 32,365 towards the upkeep of this station, spreading over a period of five years.This  would enable  the Jewish Agency to expand the Station, especially on the demonstration side.  The services of this institution would, of course, be availablefor both Jews and Arabs.7. Land registration.     With a view to preventing additions to the &quot;claims of &quot; landless&quot; Arabs infuture, Mr. French most strongly  recommends the enactment  of  legislation tocontrol dispositions of land, and he appends to his Report rough drafts of  twoordinances,  viz., the &quot;Homesteads  Protection Ordinance&quot; and the &quot;OccupancyTenants Ordinance.&quot;   He remarks &quot; Resettlement will be a  very costly operation  .... and the burden which it will impose  upon the taxpayers of Palestinecan, I submit, be justified only by a simultaneous attempt to prevent a recreationof the problem.&quot;8. Water supplies.     Mr.  French renews the recommendation made in the First Report  that theGovernment should re-assert its right to the ownership of all water, and the useof all water running to waste.       \                          Minor Recommendations.1. Survey Staff.     Should the work of settlement catch up the work of survey, it may be necessary to provide additional survey staff at a cost of  12,000 spread over eight  years.2. Partition of mesha&apos;a lands.     Mr. French suggests the appointment of a small special  staff to supervise andaccelerate this work.  Cost,  7,500,  spread over 3 years.
o                                     113. Village Registrars.         \   ,    The First Report contains a recommendation for the appointment of a staffof village registrars who will keep records of land ownership and tenancy rights,and transference of such rights.  Cost,  20,000 per annum when staff is complete.4. Livestock Industry.    It is recommended  that the Government should carry  out  certain experi-ments in animal feeding and breeding in  the interests of the livestock industry.Cost uncertain.5. Arab Co-operative Societies.    Immediate steps should be taken to promote the formation  of co-operative societies among Arab orange-growers.    (N.B.) A Registrar of Co-operative  Societies has now been appointed.)6. Expenses of land registration, partition, &amp;c.    A small Committee should be appointed to examine the scales of fees  inconnection with land transactions, which are at present so heavy as to discouragepartition and  registration.
