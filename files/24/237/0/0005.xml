Note by the President of the, .Board of Trade.             The Secretary of State for India has been good enough to        let me have a copy of the Indian Tariff Board&apos;s Report on Cotton        Goods.  This Report has been examined in the Board of Trade  and        I circulate herewith a memorandum which has been prepared on it.             I confess that I find it difficult to conceive of proposals        which, if they became known, would arouse greater and more        justifiable hostility in Lancashire.   Apart from Lancashire&apos;s        well-known dislike of specific duties as such,  the increase  in        the actual duties charged on a large  part of our exports  and the        withdrawal of the difference between  the duties on British and        foreign goods are calculated to affect Lancashire&apos;s trade most        seriously at a time when there are some signs of recovery from        the deepest trough  of the depression,   I feel  sure, too, that        the imposition of any such duties would much increase the        criticism of our Trade Agreement with India and that we should        be strongly pressed to denounce it.   Indeed, we should have  good        grounds for claiming that the putting into force of the Tariff        Board&apos;s recommendations would bo inconsistent with the under-        taking contained in Article 11 of the Trade Agreement with India.             It is evident that Lancashire has already got some wind of        the proposals and I attach as an Appendix a memorandum submitted        by the Manchester Chamber of Commerce.   Similar representations        have also been received from representative trade bodies in        Lancashire.                                               W.R;Board of Trade,   18th January, 193^.

The Report of the Indian Tariff Board on protection forthe cotton textile industry in India has now been presented-and a copy has been made available in confidence for theBoard of Trade by courtesy of the India office   2. The history of the duties on cotton piece goods inIndia and of the development of protection is briefly asfollows.   Before the war the rate of import duty was only$ ad val. , but ov/ing to revenue needs the rate, along withthat on other articles, rose to     and then to 11% ad val. (1921).The protective effect of the import duties was et one timelessened &quot;by the existence of an excise duty of Z-^i ad val. onpiece goods of native manufacture.   This duty first imposed in 1896 was abandoned in 1925.   3. The Indian Tariff Board and the system of &quot;discriminating&quot;protection date from 1925.   The guiding principles lt-id downby the Indian Piscal Commission and embodied in the resolutionunder which the Tariff Board was constituted, may &quot;be stated asfollows:-   (l) No industry should be protected unless -      (a) India has natural advantages for its practice.      (b) Without protection the industry will not develop           as rapidly as the notional interests require,      ( c) The industry is likely in the end to be ahle to           stand alone without protection.   (2) Protective duties must be adequate for their purpose        but not more than adequate, and must not be placed  so        high as to shelter inefficiency.   (3) Protective duties are applied only to those products        of an industry which are  actually made in India or        may  compete with those made in India.   4. The  question of protection for the  cotton  textile industry  was first referred  to the Tariff Board in  1926.    Tho
*That is, cotton piece goods,  piece goods made wholly  or  partly  of artificial silk, end cotton twist ami yarn.    This  memorandum in the interests  of simplicity has been confined  to the first named as the most important.Board recommended on increase from li? to 15&quot;i ad val,  in theduties on cotton piece goods in order to provide funds for abounty on the production of fine jams.    This proposal wasnot accepted.,   5. In 1930 the duties on all cotton piece goods were raised from lljS  to 15,1 ad val, and a further 5^- was imposed forprotective purposes on goods not of United Kingdom manufacture.It was also prescribed that the duty on &quot;plain grey&quot; goods of whatever origin should not be less than 3  annas per lb.   Itis important to note that, in this case as in that of other&quot;differential&quot; duties imposed by India before the ottawa conference, the differential in favour of the United kingdom was introduced not for the benefit of the United Kingdom but inthe interests of India,   It would have been inconsistent withthe second of the principles referred to in paragraph 3 above to levy unnecessarily high protective duties on United kingdom goods.   6. In 1931 the deterioration in the revenue positionnecessitated further increases in the customs tariff, andthe duties were raised to 25&amp; ed valorem on United kingdom goods and 31-^ji ad valorem on other goods, with a minimumspecific duty of 4f- annas per lb. on &quot;plain greys&quot; of whateverorigin.   7. In April 1938 the question of protection for the cottonindustry was again referred to the Tariff Board.   The board were asked, inter alia, &quot;whether the same rate of protection isrequired against the competition of goods manufactured in theUnited Kingdom as against that of goods manufactured elsewhere&quot;.They were also asked what rates of duty were recommended on thegoods covered by the reference,* &quot;according as they aremanufactured in the United Kingdom and elsewhere&quot;.
   8. In July 1932 the increase in Japanese competitiondue to the depreciation of the yon led the Government  to ask the Tariff Board to make an immediate inquiry into thismatter.   The Board recommended either an &quot;exchange dumpingduty&apos;1 or an increase in the ad valorem duty to  5055.    TheGovernment of India adopted the latter proposal,  and also raised the minimum specific duty on foreign &quot;plain greys&quot;to 5^ annns per lb.   The present duties are thus:-  2i$ adval. (with a minimum of 4;f annas per lbc on &quot;plain grey&quot;goods) on United Kingdom cotton piece goods;  50;&apos;^ ad vul0(with o minimum of 5^ annas on &quot;plain grey&quot; goods) on  othercotton piece goods.   9, The following table taken from the Re-port of theTariff Board shows the progress mnde by  the Indian and japanese industries in the Indian market fit the expenseof the United Kingdom between 1926-7 end 1931-2.r.Imports into India from UnitedKin gdom,J apen.Elsewhereo   Indlnn(Production.Totallupply.!711  ......18 ..____19......0......1......2......1,4671,5431,4561,248  523  383Mi].lions of y.irds.244	77	2,259323	107	2,357357	124	1,893562	109	2,419321	46	2,561340	53	2,9901.4,0474,3303,8304,3383,4513,766     In 1913 the United Kingdom exported 3,057 million yards of cotton piece goods to India.
   10. The following are the protective duties which the IndianTariff Board have now recommended.  These duties are to heapplied equally to all cotton piece poods, irrespective of origin.         &quot;Plain grey.............. 5 annas per 1&apos;oc         &quot;Bordered&quot; grey.......... 5^   &quot;   &quot;   &quot;         White &quot;bleached........... 6    &quot;   &quot;   &quot;         Printed, dyed and          v/oven coloured.......... 6g   &quot;   &quot;   &quot;   11. It is difficult to compare the incidence of specific andad valorem duties.  The Indian Tariff Board themselves considerthat the proposed duties will be equivalent to about 35??S                                                       oad valorem on United Kingdom goods of mediiim counts (25s, to4?s.) , 25/a on goods between 40s. and 50s. and less on stillfiner goods.   No estimate is given of the incidence on thecoarser counts, as the Indian mills already hold the hulk ofthe trade.  No precise estimate is given of the ad valoremequivalent in the case of Japanese goods, hut it is consideredby the Tariff Board to be higher that on United Kingdom goods.   12. It may well he that the ad valorem equivalent of theproposed duties is higher in the case of Japanese than, in thecase of United Kingdom goods, hut this does not mean that theexisting differential in cur favour has been retained even inpart.  Such an inference could only he drawn if United Kingdomand Japanese goods competed equally over the whole range.  Ifthe keenest competition is between the cheaper United kingdom goods and the more expensive Japanese goods (the dearer UnitedKingdom goods and the cheaper Japanese goods being lesscompetitive), comparisons based on the average value* ofBritish and Japanese goods break down.  -Further, cl^e^TraisdKingdom cloths appear on the whole toJbe^JaeatuTer, yard for yard,than corre8pondiaig^jr3p^ese--Tn^ths, it would seem that, yardfoff-TTardT^tho^in^       of tho propoood dutioo on Un-Jted-40Bgdom
ffood-a would-^be heavier than upon--Japanese  This aspect of thematter requires further examination;  at the moment it is only possible to say that in form, and at least partly in fact, theproposals involve the loss of the advantage which we now enjoyover  Ja^an.   13. As regards our position in relation to the Indianindustry, the figures given in paragraph 11 suggest that thenew proposals may at least involve some reduction In theexisting duties on the finest goods.  The Tariff Board,however, make it clear that their proposals do not exclude the levy of appropriate revenue duties, and as the general levelof the existing revenue tariff is 25$, it seems likely that thenew proposals, if accepted, would only become effective incases where they involve higher duties than at present.   14. The recommendations of the Board are arrived at by comparing the &quot;fair selling prices&quot; of the Indian mills, basedlargely on existing costs, with prices realised by the Indianmills less the existing duties on imported goods.  There is no serious attempt to answer the question whether the same rate ofprotection is required against United Kingdom goods as agataBtforeign, or to assess that difference.  There is, however, thesignificant admission that &quot;if it were possible for us to fix the duties with reference to the competition solely of british goods or solely&apos;of Japanese goods, the rates would probably be higher in the latter case and lower in the former than the ratesestimated &apos; by us. &quot;   They also give a table showing the valuesper lb. of comparable Japanese and British cloths, in which the values of the latter greatly exceed those of the former.   15. It is difficult to see any justification in existingcircumstances for the Board&apos;s present proposals.  It is only avery few months ago that the Board presented an emergencyReport as a result of which the duties on foreign (Japanese)goods were raised to 50% ad valorem, while those on United
                                                           .9 0,Kingdom goods were left at 2b% ad valorem.   They thus acceptedthe depreciation of the yen as justifying a wider differentialin our favour than had ever before been in force.   The facts are the same to-day, and yet ths same Board puts forward proposals which will certainly be represented, and reasonablyso, as depriving Lancashire of the whole of the differential.Nor it is easy to see how an increase can be justified in theexisting level of protection which the Indian industry enjoysagainst the United Kingdom.     16. During the Ottawa negotiations the Indian Delegationdeclined to consider the grant of preference as such inconnection with protective duties.   They laid considerablestress, however, upon the implications of the terms ofreference to the Tariff Board quoted in paragraph 6 above,pointing out that &quot;the policy of Discriminating Protectionis not only consistent with the adoption of a system ofdifferential duties, but even if strictly applied, requiresits adoption in the interests of the consumer.&quot;   (See theMemorandum handed in by the Indian Delegation, 6th July, 193S,circulated as O.C. (31) 88.).   They further gave anundertaking on behalf of the Government of India that &quot;thedifference between any protective duties which they invitethe Legislature to impose on United Kingdom and foreign goodsrespectively will not be less than any difference in theamount of protection required as determined on theconsideration of the report of the Tariff Board&quot;.   this undertaking remained secret and was not included in theAgreement.   The Agreement, however, contained the following(Article 11):- &quot;The Government of India will consider, inthe light of the findings of the Tariff Board, the protective duties to be imposed on goods of cotton and artificial silkaccording as they are made in the United Kingdom or elsewhere.&quot;                               -7-
        17. The Report which the Indian Delegation presented to     the Government of India after the Conference admits quite     frankly that the system of differential duties,  as a logical     consequence of the principles of Discriminating  Protection,     played a most important part in the negotiations,  particularly     in relation to the cotton industry.   Further, the     Government of India specifically undertook to consider the     question of protection for the cotton industry on a differential     basis.   This undertaking is not affected &quot;by the findings  of     the Tariff Board,        18. Another espect of the policy of Discriminating     Protection which w*.s stressed by the Indian Delegation was     the principle of according protection only to industries which     are likely in the end to stand alone without protection.   It     was felt that this principle was more austere than that     inserted in other Agreements, namely, that United Kingdom     industry should be allowed full opportunity of reasonable     competition on the basis of the relative cost of economical and     efficient production.   It was doubtless largely on account of     the insistence of the Indian Delegation on the moderation  of     their protective system, and particularly this principle,  that     no general undertakings as to the principles of protection were     sought as part of the Agreement with Indie.   It is therefore     somewhat disturbing  to find the Tariff Board arguing that  &quot;the     fact  that within a definite and measurable period of time  we     cannot predict that  the industry will be able to dispense  with     protection is not a  reason for rejecting its claim&quot;.   In view     of the importance which the United Kingdom Delegation were led     to attach to the principles of Discriminating protection,  the     United Kingdom Government should be on strong ground in asking     the Government of India to apply those principles  strictly to     this  most importent  case.oard of Trade,  17th  January, 1933.
                APPENDIX.    THE INDIAN BUDGET - 1935. AND THE    TARIFF TREATMENT 01 COTTON GOODS.A memorandum by the Manchester Chamber ofCommerce for submission to the Secretaryof State for India, and the President of           the Board of Trade.   1.  The Chamber is deeply concerned lest the Government ofIndia in introducing the next Budget in March,  1933,  should submit proposals in regard to the tariff treatment of cotton goods of United Kingdom origin which would have the effect ofmaintaining or, worse still, increasing the present obstacles to the Lancashire export trade.   The Indian Tariff Board isknown to have handed in a Report on the subject to theGovernment of India and an impression apparently exists inIndia that the report makes two recommendations v/hich from every point of view would be of the utmost gravity.   It isalleged that the Tariff Board may have recommended thesubstitution of specific duties for the present mainly ad valoremduties and it is further suggested that the specific dutiesproposed may represent an increase in the tariff barrier againstLancashire goods.   The Chamber most earnestly desires HisMajesty&apos;s Government in London to make the strongest repre-sentations to the Viceroy and his Council in favour of easiertreatment of Lancashire&apos;s exports to the Indian market, againstthe adoption of the Tariff Board.&apos;s proposals if they are infact adverse to the trade in United Kingdom cotton goods, and against the publication of the Tariff Board Report either now or at any time in the future.   2.  It is perhaps unnecessary to remind His majesty&apos;s government of the supreme importance of the Lancashire exporttrade to the economic well-being of this country.   The presentdisastrous state of trade and employment in Lancashire is due
-10-entirely to losses in the export markets, and in no othermarket have the losses &quot;been so grave as in India.    If theprospects of even the most modest recovery of trade with india are to be shattered by the imposition of further handicaps,  thenational problem presented by the condition of affairs inLancashire will be accentuated to a point at which it will bewell-nigh impossible to conceive any remedy.   The Chambertherefore respectfully submits that from a purely national pointof view a case exists which justifies His Majesty&apos;s Ministers instraining to the uttermost their legal and extra legal powers toavoid any further blow against the Lancashire trade and tosecure, if possible, an amelioration in its favour.   Facts and figures regarding the trade and employment position inLancashire could be readily supplied in support of thissubmission.   3.  It is no part of the function of the Chamber to intervene in political matters, but the influence of politics and political considerations cannot be altogether overlooked.   The Chambertherefore feels it is entitled respectfully to draw the attentionof His Majesty&apos;s Ministers to the fact that a powerful agitationis in process of being fostered and encouraged in Lancashirewhich bids fair to have consequences of a Kind quiteunprecedented in the experience of individual members of theBoard of the Chamber.  A mood of desperation is growing amongstmanufacturers and merchants in face of the competition they are meeting, mainly from Japan, in almost all their markets and ofthe persistent contraction in their export trade to India whichis the consequence of the excessive protection now afforded tothe Indian Mills.    A large and influential group of people areorganising themselves throughout the county rind have theintention of creating a public opinion to which Members ofParliament will have no choice to do otherwise than conform.
The objectives of this agitation will be to secure tradeconcessions or failing these to assuage their feelings ofdespair by attempts to wreck the new Indian legislation whichthe Government has in view.   An adverse Indian Budget inMarch next would add fuel to the flames of this agitation,  andwhilst the Chamber is the first to recognise that His Majesty&apos;ministers cannot, and should not, subordinate great imperial and National interests to a merely sectional agitation,  it  is nevertheless felt that the political consequences may be tooimportant to be entirely neglected.   The point the Chamberparticularly wishes to emphasise is that the feeling alreadydiscernible is something more intense and far-reaching than has ever before been the case in Lancashire.   4.  In common with all other responsible persons the Chamberis profoundly anxious to witness satisfactory progress in  deal-ing with the problem of the political future of India.  TheChamber considers that the present Government have handled thesituation in India in a way v/hich reflects the greatest credit on all concerned.   As regards the forthcoming Government  ofIndia Bill the Chamber is prepared to wish the measure everysuccess providing as is no  doubt the case, that it will embodyadequate safeguards for British trade and traders.     It seems to the Chamber clear that there are the highestreasons of policy for avoiding a great agitation in the countryand in Parliament on the occasion of the Iiidian Budget in march next.   The passage of the Government of India Bill may be accompanied by inevitable difficulties but  these would bemagnified a hundredfold if between now and  the introduction ofthe Bill a powerful agitation arose  in connection with theIndian Budget.   From the point  of view of  the Government ofIndia, equally with the Government in London, there would consequently  seem to be every  reason for  avoiding aprovocative Budp-et.
   5.  As to the report of the Indian Tariff Board,  the Chamberhas no precise knowledge.   It is recalled that all  such  enquiriesin the past have resulted in reports denying any just need  forfurther protection of the Indian Hills against Lancashire.The present high duties on Lancashire goods have been raisedmainly on the pica of revenue considerations.   circumstances in general have not materially altered within the period  sincethe last Tariff Board enquiry and there is no greater justifi-cation to-day for duties against Lancashire than at  any time  inthe past.   Protectionist sentiment has developed in India  andthe use of the political . weapon by the Indian millowners hasbeen permitted to exercise too great an influence.     If the Tariff Board Report is not unfavourable  toLancashire the present submission is unnecessary.   But theChamber is bound to proceed on the assumption that it may be  so,especially in view of the prevalence of rumours to that effect.     The Chamber recognises that if the Tariff Board Report ismade public the political difficulties in the way of Budgetaryaction contrary to its recommendations are liKely to be over-whelming,   An agitation in this country would then be  anunavoidable consequence, and the complications in connection withthe Government of India 3ill foreshadowed above would be  in-escapable.   The Chamber therefore stresses the desirability of with-holding publication of the report.   6.  In  the Chamber&apos;s view the Secretary of State and theGovernment of India have every reason not only for declining to institute  any increase in the. cotton duties against Lancashirebut also for reducing them.   The  revenue from cotton importduties is  an indispensable element in the Indian national accounts.   The law of diminishing returns has already begun to operate  owing to the high level of the duties and the  Chambersubmits  that until alternative sources of revenue are  available the  interests of India can only be served by a reasonable
 scale  of  tariffs on United Kingdom cotton goods.   7.  There is a further reason based entirely on consideration for the Indian point of view which leads to the Eame conclusion. The institution of specific duties in India would make it necessary to extend the Customs administration in order to deal with all  the technicalities involved in the assessment of textile imports on a specific basis *   The reports made in the past by Indian Customs experts, especially Mr. Hardy,  amply confirm this contention, and the Chamber maintains that there could  be no more inappropriate moment than the present at which to incur all the administrative problems to which such a change of policy would lead.     The Lancashire trade may frankly confess that, it  has its own selfish reasons for opposing the introduction of specific duties in India.   Apart altogether from the added difficulty of handling importations,  which will be very considerable, a system of specific duties would open the door to piecemeal progress by the Indian Millowners in their effort towards an ever-growing protective barrier.   If the trade was split up into a largenumber of technical groups for Customs purposes, and if theIndian Millowners could press for higher rates of duty on one group at a time, it would be much more difficult for theGovernment to resist that pressure or for the opposition elements to combat it.     It seems to the Chamber that such a state of affairs wouldbe an  extremely undesirable situation to create at the time when a new basis of Government is fore-shadowed.    The new  federal government will have difficulties enough without being faced with a constant problem of this sort.   The political and economic power of the Indian Millowners is such that it would be theheight of unwisdom to confer this advantage on them with the certainty that they would employ it to the full during the initiatory period of the new form of Government.
   8.  The Chamber feels that a long view consideration of theGovernment&apos;s &quot;Ottawa Policy&quot; also strongly supports  theirpresent submission.   In its representations prior to  Ottawa  theChamber expressed a genuine conviction that economic co-operationbetween India and the United Kingdom might well be fostered tothe ultimate advantage of both countries.   The prospects offostering such a policy will entirely disappear if the mostimportant element in Britain&apos;s trade with India is shattered  byan undue subserviance to the extremes of nationalisticprotection.    A policy of moderation would allow of  a  full development  of all the implications of the Ottawa policy,  andthat policy is too valuable a potentiality in the history ofthis country and the Empire to be jeopardised for purelysectional reasons and on the basis of arguments founded on acondition of affairs which may be subject to further change atan early date.   9.  It was the Chamber&apos;s desire to submit representations, ofwhich the foregoing are a summary, by word of mouth.    In an interview it would have been possible to convey more adequatelythe sentiments which actuate the Chamber.   Primarily,  theChamber seeks to perform its legitimate function of representingthe interests of the Lancashire trade, which is admittedly a vital national asset and the present condition of which iscritical beyond description.   It also has very much at heart thelarger considerations of Imperial policy.   His Majesty&apos;ministers and their Advisors will do the Chamber the justice  to acknowledge that throughout the post-war years it has  endeavoured to act in all Indian questions with due regard for theGovernment&apos;s perpetual difficulties and it has successfullyexercised a moderating influence in Lancashire.   On this occasion&apos;  the Chamber feels a profound conviction that thecourse of action it suggests is desirable in a  degree which  itis impossible to ovcr-emphasiBe.   Should the worst happen, in                                 *
                                                             h 7the forthcoming Indian Budget,  the Officers of the Chamberfear that the views of their constituents will be  such thatthe Chamber itself would no longer be able to  pursue  the policyof restraint which has been the basis for its  past actions andit seemed to the Chamber only proper to inform His Majesty&apos;ministers in advance of the situation which is likely to arise.
