THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  January 1933.SECRET.                                                Copy No.  45CP.  11 (33).CABINET.SCHEME  FOR  THE LICENSING OF  GOODS  VEHICLES.               MEMORANDUM  BY THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT.    1.   BY Cabinet 55 (32), Conclusion 7 (a) and (6). I was asked to prepare, afterconsultation with certain Departments, a draft Bill  to  regulate the transportof goods by road on the lines recommended by the Conference on Rail and road transport presided over by Sir Arthur Salter.    The Conference made certain proposals for  increased taxation of the heaviergoods vehicles, which  are being separately  considered  and would  require,  if adopted with  or  without modification, to be embodied  in legislation  entirelydistinct from that  dealing with a licensing scheme.    Preliminary drafts of the scheme have been circulated to the Treasury, theHome Office, the Scottish Office, the Board of Trade and the Ministries of Health,Labour  and Agriculture.  The points raised by these  Departments have been substantially covered in the revised draft which forms Appendix  I of this rnemo-randum.  A copy has been sent to the draughtsman  for his consideration, but, inview of the early meeting of Parliament and the pressure which will undoubtedly be exerted for  some immediate declaration of policy,  I think it would be advisableif the  Cabinet would  take the scope and  nature of  the  scheme  into  their consideration in advance of the preparation of the actual Bill.  It should, in fact,be no more difficult to follow the proposals in  their present shape than if theyhad assumed  their final legal form.    2.  The immediate occasion of the Rail and Road Conference was the serious position into  which the  main line  railways have fallen under the stress of conditions  of  competition which are widely regarded as inequitable.  It is ofcourse recognised  that &quot;this is  not the only cause of their difficulties and that trade depression probably is at least  as powerful a factor in the decline of theirtraffics.    3.  But the general  case  for licensing  goods  vehicles rests, as the  RoyalCommission on Transport pointed  out. on  a  much  wider basis and  may be examined under three  heads :      (a) The  safety  and  convenience  of  the  public,  and economy in  public           expenditure, both national and local.    (6) The stability and development of  the road haulage industry  itself under           healthier  conditions.    (c)  Justice to the  Main Line Railway Companies.    It may be noted in passing that many foreign countries and several british dominions  have recently introduced, or contemplate introducing as  a matter  of urgency, measures drastically  restricting  unregulated competition between road and rail transport, although it is too early to judge how far particular schemesof licensing or regulation have been  successful  in achieving their objects.    In these  circumstances it  is not surprising that the Royal  Commission on transport  found  in  favour of extending the licensing system,  which they had
 previously recommended for public passenger transport, to road  hauliers and that the Rail and Road Conference arrived at a similar conclusion  and extended it to all goods vehicles operating by road. (a) Public Safety and Convenience.    4.   The toll of road accidents continues to be a matter of the gravest concern and, while too much  must  not  be expected  from the removal of any individual cause of accident, there can be no doubt that the careless and illegal driving and over-loading of goods vehicles accounts for a by  no  means negligible number of deaths  and injuries.    5.   When the Road Traffic Act, 1930. was  passed  and a  revised schedule of speed limits was imposed by Parliament in the light of present-day conditions, it was assumed that it would be possible through ordinary police means to secure the effective  enforcement of the law.   It is, however, a matter of common knowledge that on many roads heavy motor vehicles  are habitually driven, by day and at night, at  speeds  greatly in excess of those  prescribed in the existing schedule.  The  mobile police have  done  something towards  securing a better observance of the new speed limits, but police action has not been  and probably cannot  be fully effective  in securing adequate enforcement  of  the  law unless a greater amount of police time and effort is  devoted to this  purpose  than  is practicable in view of the other heavy demands made  upon the police force for the detection  and repression of crime.    Moreover, even when the police are able to take  proceedings, convictions are not always easy to secure from the local benches.  In many cases the  fines imposed are insufficient to deter offenders from continuing to take the risk  of conviction in view of the substantial, though unfair, advantages to  be  gained  by continued breach of the law7.  If it is  difficult for the police to enforce speed limits, it  isstill more difficult for them  to check the illegal overloading of vehicles or, except in the most extreme and obvious cases, to prevent the use of vehicles which maybe dangerous or an  annoyance to  the  public at  large  through the noise andvibration which they cause.    6.  It may be added that the examiners of passenger vehicles not infrequently report cases of vehicles which they  have refused  to license being converted intogoods vehicles without any  material alteration to increase their safety.  Such vehicles, when used for the carriage of goods, may infringe the existing regulations in regard to  Construction and Use.  but it is clearly  impossible for  the police to examine each vehicle  and while,  in an extreme case,  a  man may  be fined for operating an  unsatisfactory vehicle, there is no  power to compel him to put  it right.    7.  When one passes to  other offences against the law, such as breach of the provisions of Section  19 of the Road Traffic Act, 1930, which restricts on grounds of  public  safety  the hours of drivers  of  motor  vehicles, it  becomes  almost impossible for the police to carry out a statutory scheme  of regulation which, while directed to the public safety, involves intervention in the sphere of  conditions of employment.   In practice the police are only able to take  action in cases where it can be shown that a serious accident has been due to excessive fatigue on the part of the driver.    Still  greater difficulties  arise in  connection  with   the  enforcement ofSection  93 of the Act, wrhich at present applies only to  the operators of public service  vehicles,  and, indeed, it may be  said that  the  administration  of this section, which requires the  observance of  fair wages and conditions of employ- ment, is outside the scope of police control altogether.    8.  These considerations point  to the necessity of  a  licensing scheme as the only satisfactory and  efficacious means of enforcing  the decisions of Parliament in matters of this kind.   It is useless, and worse than useless, to load the statute book with regulative provisions without providing the machinery whereby they can be effectively enforced.  Backed up by continuance of  police  action or support in those cases where,  as at present,  the police can properly intervene, &quot;spot&quot; inspections by a small number of special traffic examiners should suffice to secure observance of the law.  The  examiner would  be  used to bring or support proceedings in the Courts, but the licensing authority  would also have power to revoke or suspend a  licence where they are satisfied that the conditions of the licence  are not being observed.
     9.  The physical condition of the vehicles is not only an important element in the causation of accidents and in annoyance arising from noise or vibration, hut may cause excessive road damage which adds to highway costs.     10.   There is a further consideration to which attention may be drawn, and that is the desirability of imposing upon  the transport  industry itself the cost of its proper regulation, rather than throwing expense upon  the&apos; general taxpayer and the local  ratepayer. (b) Stability and Development of the Road Haulage  Industry.     11.   The  Royal Commission on Transport  (paragraph 331 of  their Final Report) stated &quot; .... we find the goods branch of the road transport industry is in a condition which lacks all unity.....&quot;     In the past it has been easy for a man with little capital or  experience to obtain a goods vehicle on easy terms (under a hire purchase agreement) often second-hand, and use it at rates which may appear to him to be economical largely because of failure to provide for depreciation, or because he can rely on under- paid labour.  The industry  has always suffered  from cut-throat competition in rates within itself.     The Royal Commission dealt with  this aspect of the matter as follows (paragraph 342) :             .  . . the  wages  and general  conditions  of  service in  the industry     leave much to be desired.  Although wre have no doubt that there are many     firms to whom this criticism is not applicable, we cannot but feel that there     are others whose profits, if there be any, represent  to a considerable extent     the difference, expressed in terms of money, between the wages paid and the     conditions obtaining, and the wages which should be paid and the conditions     which should obtain, if proper standards were  maintained.  Improvements     in these directions will go far to weed out the less desirable operators and to     place the  industry on a sounder basis by removing the element of uneconomic     operation which undoubtedly exists.&quot;     They recommended  the extension of  Section 93 of the Road  Traffic  Act, which applies  the Fair Wages  Clause to the drivers of passenger vehicles, to include persons employed in connection with the licensed vehicles of road hauliers.     The Royal Commission further  pointed out  that, so long  as the  road transport  industry  contained within itself operators who cut rates and main- tained low  standards for  their workers,  the position  of the  more  responsible operators  was  made  difficult and uncertain, and they made in their Report (paragraph 332) the important point, which has to be borne in mind in connection with future policy, that&apos;the internal organisation of the industry &quot; is an essential precedent to any attempt at general co-ordination with other forms of transport.&quot;     12.  Even the critics of the Salter Conference^  Report have not objected to the proposal to impose by statute upon road hauliers an obligation to pay fair wages  and observe fair conditions of  service for  persons employed.  From the point of view of the employers in the industry, protection against the quotation of uneconomic rates by casual or piratical operators would no doubt also be widelydesired. (c) Justice to the Main Line Railway Companies.    13.  In the Report of the Salter Conference (paragraph 35) the position is summarised in the statement that the railway representatives do not  ask  that either by taxation of commercial motor transport beyond its fair share of the costof the roads they use as their permanent way     &quot;or  by restrictive regulation  not required  in  the public interest,  traffic    should be forced back to the railways which  they  are  not able to carry so    conveniently or on so low a basis of real cost.  They  do not ask that any class    of service which  may have  been   rendered  obsolete or comparatively    uneconomical by the  new  form  of   transport   now  available  should  be    artificially maintained.&quot;    14. The present scheme has been drawn up with due regard to these soundconsiderations.  It is, however, necessary to be on guard against the suggestion,which certain propagandists are  assiduous to spread, that the whole problem can
 be easily solved by repealing, the mass of statutory requirements imposed by the Railway Regulation and Traffic Acts of last century by a stroke of the pen.  This aspect of  the  problem is  further  dealt  with  in paragraphs 33-35  of this Memorandum.     If in addition to an equitable adjustment  of taxation, effective measures were taken to ensure that the carriage of goods by  road was conducted  (a) in properly maintained vehicles  which inflicted no  unreasonable damage upon the roads and were operated in respect of their speeds and loading according to law, and (6) by labour remunerated at rates and employed under conditions applied by the better operators,  the railway companies&apos; case would be met in part, but only in part.     15.   Thus,  while  the Salter Conference  and  the  Royal  Commission are agreed in recommending that road hauliers should be licensed conditionally upon the maintenance of their vehicles in a proper state of fitness and the observance of fair  wages and conditions for  their employees, the  former go a good deal further;  first, in recommending that the licensing  system should be applied not only  to those carrying the goods of others  for  hire or reward, but also  to those using road vehicles  for the purpose  of their own  business; and, secondly, in proposing, as a condition  of the licences granted to hauliers (but not ancillary users), that the licensing authority should have regard to any excess in  existing transport facilities that may make the grant of a licence for the full number of vehicles asked for against  the  public interest (paragraph 107).     16.   Immediately on  the publication of the Report,  1 invited representative Associations to send me their observations.  In  considering the scheme, regard must be had to  the criticisms upon it, and  in Appendix  II will be found a very- brief summary of observations received from a large number of Associations in so far as they are relevant  to the regulation (as apart from the taxation) of goods vehicles. Draft Scheme.     17.   The draft scheme set out in Appendix I indicates the scope and nature of the  legislative  provisions  required  to give  effect  in  principle   to  the recommendations contained in  the Salter Report.     18.   It will be noted  (paragraph I (ii)) that it is proposed to exclude from the scope of the scheme certain  agricultural vehicles, i.e., vehicles registered in the name of a person engaged in agriculture and used solely for the haulage or conveyance  of the produce of, or of articles required for the purposes of, the agricultural land he occupies,  with an extension  to cover  the co-operative use of such  vehicles.  Such vehicles are operated  under  different  conditions from commercial vehicles;  at certain seasons of the year it is admittedly difficult for farmers to  observe the statutory hours of  labour;  and  their use of the public roads is limited.    In paragraph I  certain other exemptions are proposed and  power  is taken to exempt by  regulation any particular class of vehicle.   All exempted vehicles. however, will  be liable to examination on the grounds of physical fitness.    19.  The Licensing Authority. It is  no  doubt generally expected in the interests of simplicity and economy\ and as foreshadowed in the report of the Royal Commission, that the  existing machinery set up by the Road Traffic Act, 1930, for licensing passenger  vehicles will  be  adapted to cover goods  vehicles and that the creation of an  entirely new machinery will  be avoided.    The scheme therefore  provides (paragraph II) that the  licensing authority shall be the Chairman of the Traffic Commissioners in each area set up under the 1930  Act.   By the beginning of  1934, which is the earliest  date at  which this scheme could  come  into operation, the  duties of the Traffic Commissioners with regard to  public service  vehicles should have  become sufficiently  stabilised  to enable  them  to  undertake,  without  much difficulty,  the licensing  of  goods vehicles.    The question has been  considered whether the  Chairman should sit with other persons, e.g.,  the two Commissioners selected  from panels nominated  by  local-authorities, who  sit in connection with the  licensing of. public  service  vehicles.
On various grounds the proposal is not regarded as a good one: local authorityrepresentatives would  not he especially qualified and, in  view of their  direct interest in reducing heavy traffic and so saving highway expenditure, they mightbe held to be biassed against road traffic.   Local authorities are not the guardiansof industry  in the same way as they are the guardians  of the interests  of the travelling public, and  they have had no jurisdiction in this respect in the past,whereas they had long  been licensing authorities for passenger vehicles.    If representatives of transport were added, it would  lie necessary to include representatives of both  road and rail transport, and it  is thought  that these interests,  like representatives of trade and industry,  would more  appropriatelyexpress their views by  memoranda in  support of  or objection  to  particularapplications.  The difficulty  of obtaining the services of well-qualified persons of judicial mind in an honorary capacity would no doubt be great.  The chairmen of the existing Traffic Commissioners are entirely impartial,  they  have,  or can easily gain,  a pretty shrewd idea of the needs of their areas and, sitting alone.would no doubt reach quite as sound a conclusion as would be reached by a largerbody.  Any  objection  that might,  be made to  the exercise of jurisdiction by a.single Commissioner would  be  mitigated,  if not removed, by the constitutionproposed  for the Appeal Tribunal.    20.  Appeal Tribunal. There are reasons for not automatically applying themachinery prescribed  by the Road  Traffic Act,  whereby appeals regarding thegrant, of passenger vehicle licences lie to the Minister of Transport.  Appeals onsuch matters before the  passing of that Act lay to  the Minister, and the juris-diction over a wide range of matters connected with the fares, stages and services provided by trams and omnibuses rested  with  public  departments.  In  this casea  new type  of jurisdiction is required  and it may appropriately  carry  a new machinery and an appellate tribunal of independent authority (paragraph XVII).A specially constituted Tribunal is proposed for Scotland.    21.   The Salter Conference recommended in paragraph 111 (D) and (F) thatthe licensing machinery  should  be such as to avoid delay and legal  expense;  thescheme therefoi-e provides in paragraphs IV (5) and V  (6) that, if objection ismade regarding a  carrier&apos;s licence, written memoranda  of objections shall be furnished and the decision  whether to hear oral evidence or sit in public is leftto the discretion of the licensing authority.    22.   Carriers&apos;  Licences. It is proposed (paragraph III) that all licences for goods vehicles shall be subject to the holder fulfilling the following conditions I-     (a) maintaining the vehicle in  a proper state of fitness;  it will  be possible           for use of a particular  vehicle to be suspended  until  it  has  been           properly repaired;     (b) keeping proper records of journeys, &amp;c;     (c) observing the speed and weight limits;     (d) further, a  Public Carrier&apos;s Licence shall be subject to the payment of           reasonable  wages and observance of proper conditions of service for           drivers  or  statutory attendants of vehicles employed by the  holder;           and a Limited Carrier&apos;s Licence shall be subject to the payment of           such wages and observance of such conditions  by the holder only in           respect of drivers and attendants engaged in the conveyance of goods           for others for hire or reward.     The  Report of the Royal  Commission recommended  that the Fair  WagesClause be applied  to  road  hauliers.  The  Salter Conference went further, and recommended that  reasonable wages and proper conditions of service should be observed  by  all  operators  of  goods vehicles.  It.   no doubt  appeared  to  theConference  to be reasonable to require all operators to  be subject to  such  a requirement.   From the point of view of the railways and public carriers  proper.it might appear  unfair that persons  using  vehicles  for  the conveyance  oftheir own goods should  be  allowed  to compete with them  without being  subjectto the same statutory  regulation  of wages  and  conditions  of service as is applicable to the public carrier; on grounds of public safety, moreover, it wouldbe desirable to take all possible steps to ensure that drivers of goods vehicles,
      which are capable of high speeds and of inflicting serious injury  to person and      property, should be responsible persons and reasonably remunerated.          The question, however, has been fully explored with the Ministry of Labour,      who  feel that  serious and  far-reaching  effects  on collective  arrangements in      industry as a whole would result if. in the case  of persons whose use of motor      vehicles formed an  ancillary part of some other business or industry, it were      proposed to give to those employees engaged in one particular occupation motor      driving the  statutory  protection   of  the  Fair  Wages  Clause, when  other      employees in  the same industry had not similar  protection.   A decision of an      outside tribunal in the case of one occupation in a business or industry might      also affect the balance of conditions in the business or industry as a  whole.          Accordingly, it is proposed to limit the scope of the Fair Wages Clause to the      employees of public carriers and the employees of limited carriers engaged in the      conveyance of the goods of  others for hire or  reward.   Such employees can be      regarded as forming an industrial unit of their own, and a protection afforded to      them would not have repercussions on industry generally.          Such a limitation, which would be in accord  with the expressed views of the      Conference of  National Organisations  interested in Road  Transport,  would      greatly simplify the whole scheme and remove much opposition.          It can be left to the Trade Unions and Employers&apos; Organisations to suggest      amendments, which would be carefully considered,  for limiting or extending the      scope of the application of the principle of the Fair Wages  Clause, if they can      show such a course to be both practicable and desirable.          23.  Ancillary  Users. The  man  who carries his own goods  in his owm      vehicles does so presumably because it is either cheaper or more convenient to him      to do so than to send them by rail, and it is proposed to keep the requirements      imposed on these &quot; ancillary users &quot; at a minimum.  The scheme  attached is. in      its application  to them,  a system of special registration,  not carrying any onus      of proving public convenience or necessity, and their licences would  be issued as      -of course and for periods of three years.          24.  Hauliers. Two classes of  road transporters remain :  One. the general      haulier or carrier, whose whole livelihood depends on carrying the goods of others;      the other, the man who uses his vehicles partly for carrying his own goods and      partly  for carrying the goods of others.   The latter is the most difficult to deal      with; he takes  an outward load of his own goods and debits himself as a manu-      facturer or trader with  practically the whole cost of that transport, as he may      have to make  the return journey  empty.  When he  has delivered his  load,      however, he is apt in many cases to cast round for a return load, and is prepared      to accept one at almost any price, as the revenue is so much extra money.  In this      way he cuts rates against both the regular haulier or carrier and the railways.          The regular haulier or carrier, on the other hand, has over a period to equate      his rates to his  costs.   He performs a service, however, which is often, especially      in the case of long-distance traffic, in direct competition with the railways.          25.  LTnder common or co-ordinated management of road and rail transport,      there would no  doubt be suitably graded scales of rates and charges to reflect the      greater convenience of one or other  means  of transport.  The Salter Conference.      however,  recommended that the question of any control over rates should be left      for further consideration, as it obviously requires further investigation and very      cautious handling.  But they recommended that  the quantum of  road transport      should, as part  of their immediate proposals, be adjusted so as not to produce any      uneconomic excess of the transport facilities available, no doubt hoping that this      would  have the effect of preserving to the railways the volume of traffic they now      carry and a fair proportion of what may be anticipated when trade revives.           The main  problem  in a  scheme of licensing  is  how to give effect to this      proposal.   Some foreign countries  have  attempted  a &quot; routing system.&quot; In      undeveloped  countries  with  few   roads  and  relatively  isolated  centres ofv     population, this may be feasible.  In Great Britain conditions are  quite different,      and  it is the  essence  of road transport  to carry anything at any time  from      anywhere to  anywhere;  a routing system  would therefore be unduly restrictive      in its operation, almost impossible in present circumstances to administer, and is      not advocated in any quarter.  An  alternative  might be a limitation of the  types
of commodities to be carried by road, but as a basis of licensing this is also thought to be impracticable.  Powers, however, could be taken (see paragraph XX of thescheme) to prevent the carriage by road over certain  distances of certain goods which are now borne by rail or canal or coastwise shipping.    26.  The  scheme attached is put forward for consideration  as devised tosecure fairer conditions of competition without unduly hampering the developingindustry of road transport.   It provides for  three types of licences :     (a) A  public- carriers licence for the regular  haulier or carrier which will           allow  him to  carry  goods for others  for hire  or reward without           restriction of route or area.  He must apply for a licence in  each area           in which he has a base or centre of operation.  As a general rule a           haulier or carrier more or less limits his activities to a  radius around           that base, and it is. proposed to give other persons providing  transport           facilities for the goods of others in that area, except limited carriers           (see below),  a  right  to object to  his  application.  The Licensing           Authority will take into consideration the traffic needs  of the  district           to be served by the applicant,  and will be able to judge the  merits of           the application in the light of any objections received (paragraph IV).    (b) A limited carrier&apos;s licence for the dual  user which will allow him to carry           his own goods  without restriction, and the goods of others subject to           such  restrictions  as  the licensing  authority  may  see  fit .to  impose.           Other persons providing  transport facilities for others,  including           public carriers, are to be entitled to object to his application.   It is           felt to be sound that the public carrier  should have the first claim to           carry the goods of others by road (paragraph V).    (c)  A private carrier&apos;s licence for the ancillary user which  will entitle him           to  carry  his own goods only,  and which shall be granted without           question (paragraph  VI).  If strong opposition is  felt to the proposal           to  put the  ancillary user under  obligation  to have  each individual           vehicle operated by him specified on the licence, it would be possible           for him to be  merely  registered as a private carrier without the           necessity for notifying changes of vehicles;  the licensing authority&apos;s           control, however, would be considerably weakened thereby.    The scheme makes provision for the necessary latitude to hire vehicles to meetspecial circumstances, and to provide a margin for expansion of business, and tobring trailers under control (paragraphs VII and VIII).    It will be noted that, whereas the Salter Conference recommended only twotypes of licence one  for hauliers, the  other  for ancillary users the schemeprovides for three  types by  introducing the limited  carrier&apos;s licence.   This isconsidered to be the most satisfactory means of overcoming the  difficulty felt  tothe proposal of  the  Conference to allow the ancillary  user to act as  a haulierwithin an arbitrary radius of 10 miles (paragraph  111 E.); such a radius would operate unevenly between rural and urban areas, for in the latter an ancillaryuser could still conduct a very profitable haulage business, while in the  country the radius might be quite inadequate for the legitimate purposes of the  licenseeand the convenience of the rural population.    27.  Way-Bill. Paragraph  XIII   makes provision   for   the  carryingof  a  way-bill  or  time  sheet.   There has  been   much  objection  on thepart of  the road  transport interests to the keeping of  *&apos; useless  records,&quot;largely  no doubt   because   it   is  realised  that  the  journey  record  willprovide  a visible  record  of  infringements  of weights  and  drivers&apos;  hours,and is  an effective  means  of  enforcement.   It  is  not,  however,  proposedto  require that  more  information shall be entered  in the  record  than  manyfirms now require  their drivers  to keep on a  daily  way-bill; moreover,  it  isproposed that  the  licensing  authority  shall  have  wide  power  to  exemptindividuals from filling up details of what may be inappropriate or unreasonablyburdensome in view of the nature of their particular business.  Sir William KaysCommittee on Local Expenditure (paragraphs 125-6) endorsed the proposal fora way-bill or time sheet as a means of checking overloading.    28.  Paragraph XIX (a) embodies  the  recommendation  (paragraph  120 ofthe Salter Report) that the Minister should take power to exclude certain vehicles
     from certain classes of roads.  Paragraph XIX (6) is designed to meet the wishes     of local authorities by giving them power to restrict the use of roads within their     areas, subject to confirmation by the Minister of Transport.         29.   Paragraph XX is designed to give effect to paragraph 124 of the Report     to empower the  Minister to prohibit the carriage of certain goods by road for     more than  certain distances.   The powers proposed to be  taken  in  the latter     paragraph  are far-reaching and  may give  rise to opposition,  and require  most     careful consideration in principle and from the point of view of administration.         30.   Both  the  Royal  Commission  and  the Salter  Conference  attached     importance to  an advisory  body to give assistance to the Minister on transport     matters  in the  widest  aspects.  Paragraph  XXII provides  for  a Transport     Advisory Council of 25 members, upon which all transport interests can find     representation.   Its  functions  will be  purely advisory and the  Minister  will     not  necessarily be obliged to  accept a  majority report.   Provision  would be     made for the Council  to work through sub-committees to which  the  Minister     could appoint  additional  members with  special knowledge of the matters to     be considered.  In order to avoid overlap of function and administrative expense,                                     sory Committee established under the Ministrv     of Transport Act, 1919. would be abolished.         31.   The scheme in its present form does not propose the  institution of     driving tests for  the drivers of motor vehicles.  There may, however, be pressure     from the Trade Unions and from  the strong &quot;pedestrian&quot;&apos; element in the House     of Lords  and  from other quarters for some system of driving tests.  To impose     such tests on drivers of all  goods vehicles would involve  considerable initial     expense :  it would, however,  be possible to provide  that all persons who after     a  certain  date-say,  the 1st January, 1934 wish to drive heavy motor  vehicles     (i.e.. vehicles over 2i tons in weight unladen)  should first have passed a driving     test.     The Railway Companies.         32.   It will  be necessary to give consideration to the possibility of relieving     the railway companies of some of the statutory restrictions under which  they     now conduct their business.  The  Salter Conference recommend that they should     be relieved of the obligation  to publish their  road rates imposed by their  Acts     of 1928 pending such time as a similar obligation may be imposed on road  hauliers     generally.   This  is a small matter (paragraph XXI).         33.  How  far it would be necessary  or possible  to  relieve  the  railway     companies of any of their obligations in respect of not granting undue preferences     is a much more serious question, as is the further question how far, if at all, they     should be relieved of  the obligation to publish  their railway rates and make their     books open for inspection at any station by any trader.         As mentioned in  paragraph 14,  some of the  trading bodies who  have     commented upon the  Salter Report suggest that the proper way of dealing  with     the position is to relieve the railway companies of these requirements rather  than     impose restrictions on road transport ;\but they make no specific suggestions and.     as the Report itself points  out,  the&apos;&apos; existing enactments  have  been  thought     necessary in the public interest and, quite apart from the statutory requirement,     it is not practicable  for large public utilities to discriminate in  the  treatment     of their customers or to conduct their business on lines of secrecy.   On the other     hand, there can be no doubt that the road hauliers&apos; freedom from control in these     respects  gives  them  a great competitive advantage.   I have invited  concrete     recommendations  from  important trading  bodies, such as  the Federation of     British Industries, on these points.v        34.   For the reasons given in the earlier part of this memorandum I should     nob consider any  action which it may be possible to take in relieving the railway     companies from  present restrictions as a substitute for the establishment  of a     scheme of licensing  goods vehicles, but rather as a complementary  measure for     bringing  about a sounder economic position.   The licensing scheme, as I  have     pointed out, would in  itself probably  afford  a basis for further  correlation of     function between road  and rail.
    35.  A subject which will, I think, in any case require legislative treatment is the recent decision that the railway companies are not legally entitled to chargeflat rates for all traffics of a particular firm over a wide area.    36.  In conclusion, attention should perhaps be called to the views expressedby the Salter Conference to the effect that their recommendations (including those&apos;in favour of  increased taxation) will not solve the difficulties  which the railwaycompanies are now experiencing.    The Conference point out (paragraph 29) that they only offer an alleviationof one of the causes of loss of railway revenue by  dealing  with any  existingunfairness in the incidence of highway costs and inadequacy of the regulations toprotect the public and other users of the road against undesirable forms of road traffic.  In paragraph  30 they point out that this will not necessarily     &quot;result  in a situation  that is of  the maximum  economic advantage to the    community as a whole.  This would only be the case on the assumption that    we can properly isolate  particular industries without regard to the essential    solidarity of industry and railway services as  a  whole  and to the  inter-    dependence of  their fortunes.   The correction of the incidence of highway    costs may mean that each class of road transport  is in future paying its own    real economic cost. But the withdrawal from  the railways of all classes of    traffic  which finds road transport economical,  even on this corrected basis.    may still create a  situation on the railways which must react seriously upon    other industries.   Railway transport caters for all industries; and its tariffs    have been built up on the principle of charging less than a proportionate cost    of service to certain traffics, and more to others.   The limitation of charges    in the first case has been possible because the railways were also carrying the    other class of traffic.   Even when we have corrected the incidence of highway    costs therefore the broad question remains, whether it is possible to retain in    permanent equilibrium  two systems,  the economic  cost of service being the    guiding principle of charge for one set of industries, and &apos; what the traffic-    will bear &apos; for the other.  It must be recognised  that some industries whose    goods  are now carried  by the railways on the latter principle, and  whole    communities dependent upon them, would be most seriously  affected if they    were charged the full proportionate cost of service.....&quot;Summary of  Points requiring Decision.    37.  The main issues  of policy and the principal points likely to give rise tocontroversy on which I desire at this stage an indication of my colleagues&apos; views are as follows  (the references  in  Arabic figures are to the paragraphs of theforegoing memorandum and in Roman figures are  to the paragraphs of thescheme in Appendix I) :     1.  Should there  be  a special  licensing system for goods vehicles to securethe observance of certain minimum requirements-fitness of vehicles, observance of speed and weight limits, and reasonable wages  and conditions of service fordrivers engaged in the definite  industry  of  the transport of  goods by  road?(paragraphs 4-11  and 22, and I and III).    If so-    (a) Should  the  licensing  authorities be the  Chairmen  of  the  traffic commissioners sitting alone, with  appeals to  a special Tribunal constituted asproposed? (paragraphs 19-20 and II and XVII).    (b) Should the carriers&apos; licences be divided into three classes  as  proposed(viz.,  Public  Carriers&apos;, Limited  Carriers&apos; and  Private  Carriers&apos;  Licences) ?(paragraphs 23-26  and IV-VI).    (c)  Should  the scheme provide that,  after the expiration  of  the initiallicensing period, the licensing authority should be  directed  to  have regard toobjections  by others providing transport facilities on the grounds of excess of facilities in the case of an application for a Public Carrier&apos;s Licence, and to similar objections to an application by a Limited Carrier so  far as it relates tothe carriage  of goods  for others? (paragraphs 24-26 and IV-V).    2. (a) Should power be taken to exclude by Order certain classes of vehiclesfrom certain classes of roads? (e.g., vehicles of more than a specified weight might
be prohibited from traversing unclassified  roads in a defined area except for thepurpose of delivering or collecting  goods  from premises thereon).     (b) Should the powers of local authorities be increased so as to enable themto make Orders (subject to confirmation by the Minister of Transport) restricting the use of roads within their areas?  (paragraphs 28 and XIX).     3.  Should power be taken to prohibit by Order the carriage of certain classesof goods by road  for more than certain distances? (paragraphs  29 and XX).     4.  Should the Railway Companies be relieved of their obligation to publishtheir road rates?  (paragraphs 32 and XXI).     5.  Should a Transport Advisory Council be established with the compositionproposed and take the place of the  existing statutory Roads  Advisory Council?(paragraphs  30 and XXII).     6.  Should a system of driving tests be established for the drivers of all orcertain goods vehicles e.(j., heavy Motor Cars? (paragraph 31).                                                                  P.  J. P     Ministry of Transport,              January 26, 1933.
APPENDIX  1.                   Draft  Scheme fok the Licensing  of Goods Vehicles.     I.  NO  person shall carry goods or burden  on a  public  road  in a  mechanically-propelled vehicle constructed or  adapted for the conveyance  of goods or burden or in a trailer drawn by a  mechanically-propelled vehicle,  unless he has  first  secured from the Licensing  Authority a public carrier&apos;s licence, or  a limited carrier&apos;s licence or a private carrier&apos;s  licence,  as the case may be, on which  that vehicle- shall  be  specified, or in the ease of  a trailer  on which authority to use a trailer shall be given; provided that a carrier&apos;s licence shall not be required  in respect of the conveyance  of goods or burden by      (i) A tramcar,  a  trolley  vehicle, a  public  service  vehicle  or a hackney carriage,  when           used as  such.     (ii) A vehicle  registered in the  name  of a person engaged in agriculture  and used  solely           for the haulage or conveyance of the produce of, or of articles required for the purposes           of, the  agricultural  land which  he  occupies.   (The scope of this  provision  should           correspond with  that of the  amendment made by  the Finance  Act, 1027, in para-           graph 5 of  the  Second  Schedule to the  Finance Act,  1020,  extended to  cover the           co-operative  use of a vehicle by a number of neighbouring farmers;  opportunity should           then be taken in the Finance  Bill  to extend correspondingly the  reduced rates of           taxation now applicable  to vehicles used iu agriculture.)     (iii) A trailer drawn by a passenger-carrying vehicle with seats for less than eight persons.     (iv) Government vehicles.     (v; A vehicle  for  the  time being  used exclusively by a  local  or police authority for road           cleansing and  watering, sanitary or  police  purposes.     (vi) A vehicle  used for fire brigade  or ambulance purposes.    (vii) A vehicle  or trailer of any class which the  Minister may by regulation exempt.    II.  The Licensing Authority for each area mentioned in the  Third  Schedule to the road traffic Act (as may  from time to time be varied) shall be tho Chairman of the Traffic Commissioners for the time  being. Carriers&apos; Licences.    HI.   The Licensing Authority  shall have power to  issue carriers&quot; licences valid  for a period not exceeding in the case of a public carrier&apos;s licence two years, in the case of a limited earner&apos;s licence one year, and in the case of a private  carrier&apos;s licence three years,  which shall specify the. vehicles to be covered by the  licence.    A licence shall be subject to the holder     (a) Maintaining each vehicle  specified  on the licence in a  condition fit for  service.           (1) The  issue of  a carrier&apos;s licence shall be subject to a declaration from the applicant    that each vehicle is in a condition fit for service and fulfils  the requirements of the Construc-   . ,tion and Use Regulations for the time being in force,  and will during  the currency of the    licence be  so maintained.           (2) Certifying  Officers  and  vehicle  examiners  shall  be  appointed   with powers of    inspection  of all goods vehicles (including exempted  vehicles) similar  to those given in T S. 60 (3) of the Road Traffic Act, 1930.           (3) If a  Certifying Officer or vehicle examiner finds that owing to any defects a vehicle    is or  is  likely  to become unfit for service he may serve  on the driver in the prescribed    form  a notice of suspension of the licence  in respect of that particular vehicle  which shall    be operative either immediately,  or, if he. is satisfied  that  the defects can  be remedied in a    short  time and do  not involve any immediate risk to  public safety, within  any period up to    10 days.  A copy of the notice of suspension shall be  sent  to the  owner of  the vehicle.           In the case  of an exempted vehicle, the Certifying Officer or  vehicle examiner may    serve a notico  on the driver  of such vehicle  that specified defects shall  be remedied to his    satisfaction before  it is again used for the carriage of goods.           (4) As soon  as the notice of suspension becomes operative the Certifying Officer or    vehicle examiner may remove the plate from  the vehicle.           (5) The noticeof suspension shall cease to be operative and the plate shall be returned,    or the notice of  suspension shall  not  become operative, when  the operator has satisfied a    vehicle examiner that the defects have been remedied.           (G) The  vehicle examiner shall  act under the direction  of the Certifying Officer  and    tho Minister may issue directions to the Certifying Officer as to the manner in which  they    are to carry  out their duties.           (7) An operator who is  aggrieved by a notice of suspension  may appeal to tho Certifying    Officer and from him to the  Minister,  but  in the meantime the  notice of suspension shall    remain in force until the suspension is removed  by  a  vehicle examiner or Certifying Officer,    or by the Minister.  Provided that if the Certifying Officer considers that  the Construction    and Use  Regulations for the time being in force are complied with in respect  of the vehicle    the suspension  shall  be removed.    (b) Keeping records of hours worked by drivers, loads carried, &amp;c, in the manner prescribed          by the Minister of Transport (see paragraph XIII below).    (c) Observing the maximum limits of speed  and weight prescribed  for each type of  vehicle.    (d) Observing the hours of labour, &amp;o., laid down in S.  10 of the Road Traffic Act.
     (e) Further, a Public Carrier&apos;s Licence shall be. subject to  the  payment of  reasonable wages           and  observance  of  proper conditions of service for drivers  or  statutory  attendants           of vehicles employed by the holder;  and a Limited  Carriers  Licence shall bo subject           to the payment  of  such  wages  and the observance  of such conditions  by the holder           in respect of drivers  and attendants engaged in the conveyance of goods for others           for hire or reward.   (The Fair Wages Clause (cf. S. 93 of the  Road Traffic Act, 1930),           should form  the  basis of this part of the scheme.)     If the Licensing Authority is  satisfied  that a  holder  of a  carrier&apos;?  licence has contravenedany of  these requirements,  or has wrongfully  used his licence, he  may revoke or suspend thelicence  [in reference to all or any of the vehicles specified thereon] subject to  the qualificationsof S. 74 of the Bond Traffic Act, which limit  the  exercise of the power to cases where  breach of conditions has been wilful  or  frequent, or dangerous to  the  public, [and in  deciding whether to revoke or  to  suspend, and  in determining a period  of  suspension, shall have  regard  to theeffect on any contracts  entered into by  the holder].   -Appeals against  revocation or suspension should go to the  same tribunal as appeals againstrefusals to grant carriers&apos; licences  (see  paragraph  XVII below).     Tower will  be necessary to express  the licences to expire at different times, so as to  spreadtlie  work of  renewal  over the  year  (cf. S. 80 of the Road Traffic Act).     It should be made  clear  that  a  earrier&apos;s  licence  can at any  time during its currency  be modified or  varied by the  withdrawal  of  vehicles, or the addition or  substitution of vehiclesother than those originally specified (cf. paragraph  IV  (o) and  V (6)).Public Carriers  Licences (two years&apos; validity).     IV. (1)  A public carrier&apos;s licence  shall entitle the  holder to  use the  vehicles specified  onthe  licence for the carriage of goods  or burden for others for  hire  or reward,  and for  no other purpose, save for the carriage of goods required  for  the purposes  of his  business  as  a  publiccarrier.     (2) The  applicant for such licence shall supply to the Licensing Authority  in writing  and ina prescribed  form particulars of      (a) The  facilities he proposes to provide,  including the limits within which his  vehicles are           normally  used.     (b) The  number  and type of vehicles  he proposes to use  (including trailers).He  shall make  a separate  application for  a public carrier&apos;s  licence in  respect of each  base orcentre from  which he proposes to operate  his  vehicle or vehicles to the Licensing Authority in whose area that  base or centre is located;  provided that it shall be competent  for the licensing authority to  amalgamate any  two  or more applications in respect  of  two or more bases within his own  area.     (3) The  Licensing  Authority in  the exercise  of  his  discretion whether to grant  a  publiccarriers  licence shall have regard to      (a) The  number  and type of vehicles  proposed to be operated  under the licence (including           trailers).     (b) Any objections  made by persons,  other than persons  holding limited  carriers&apos; licences,           providing  facilities  whether by  road or  by alternative means of transport (including           railways,  canals  or coastwise shipping)  for the carriage  of goods for others for hire           or reward in  the same  districts or areas,  on  the ground  of an excess of transport           facilities,  either  generally  or in respect of  any particular class of vehicles  in the           districts which the  applicant  proposes  to serve.     (c) The  past conduct of the applicant  as a public carrier (cf.  S. 67 (2) of the Road Traffic           Act).     In the exercise of Iris discretion it shall be competent for  the  Licensing Authority  either torefuse a public carrier&apos;s licence or to grant one  for  vehicles of a number and type different  fromthat contained in the application.     (4) The  Licensing Authority shall have power to issue interim licences pending  completionof any necessary inquiries, and also short-term licences to  coyer seasonal or special business.     (5) The  Licensing Authority shall give public notice of any application for  a public carrier&apos;slicence  and,  in. his  discretion, of  any  application  to increase the number of  vehicles to  be specified on  such licence (including  trailers), vmd  of  any proposal  to substitute  one vehicle  by-another of a  different tonnage or type.  If objection  is made,  written  memoranda  of  objectionshall be furnished, and in the discretion of the Licensing Authority  oral  evidence may be heard,and  he may  sit in public.   When oral evidence is  heard, the applicant  and objectors shall  havethe  right of  being present.     (0) In the case  of an applicant  who owned and operated  vehicles for  the  carriage of goodsor burden for others for hire or reward  at  an&quot;  time during the year immediately preceding theintroduction  of this Bill,  the Licensing Authority shall in the first licensing period  grant a publicearrier&apos;s licence  for  an  equivalent tonnage of vehicles without  question, though  full particulars-as required in (2) above  shall he supplied.Limited  Carriers&apos; Licences  (one year&apos;s validity).     V. (1)  A limited carrior&apos;s licence  shall entitle the  holder to  use the vehicles  specified  onthe  licence both  for the carriage  of goods or burden otherwise than  for hire, or  reward, and  also,subject to  such conditions as the Licensing Authority may see  fit to impose, for the carriage ofgoods or burden for  others  for lure  or reward,        &apos; &quot; ,                           ...     (2) Same as IV  (2).                           .         &apos; &apos;            .&apos;.,  ,              &apos;  ;
     (3) Tlio Licensing Authority  in  the exercise of his discretion whether to grant  a limited-carrier&apos;s licence shall have regard  to      (a) The extent to which the applicant intends to provide  facilities  tor the carriage of  goods           for others for hire or reward.     \h) The number and  type of  vehicles proposed  to be operated under  the  licence  (including           trailers).     (c) Any objections  made  by  other persons  providing facilities,  whether by road  or  by           alternative means of transport, for the carriage of goods for others for hire or reward in           the  same districts or areas,  on the ground of an excess of transport  facilities, either           generally  or in  respect of any  particular class of  vehicles in the districts which  the           applicant proposes to serve.     (d) Tho past  conduct  of  the  applicant as  a limited carrier  (c/.  S.  67 (2) of  the  Road           Traffic Act).

(4) Same as IV  (4).     (5) The Licensing Authority shall have  power at  any time to waive  or  modify any  conditions imposed by him  under sub-paragraph (3) above.     (6) Same as IV  (5).     (7) In the case of an  applicant who owned and  operated vehicles  partly for  the carringe ofgcxxls or burden  for others  for hire or reward and partly for his own purposes at any time duringthe year immediately preceding the introduction  of this Bill, the Licensing Authority shall in thefirst year grant  a  limited  carrier&apos;s licence for an equivalent  tonnage of vehicles,  and  shall  notattach any condition (other than those required  by paragraph  III  to  be attached  to all carriers&apos;licences) which would entail any  substantial interference with the  business conducted by  himduring that year, though  full particulars as required  in (2) above shall be furnished.Private Carriers&apos; Licences (three years&apos; validhVy).     VI. (1) A private carrier*s licence shall entitle the holder to use the vehicles specified on thelicence only      (a)  For the carriage of goods or burden  otherwise  than for hire or reward iu connection with           his trade or business, and     (b) For  the  carriage  in connection with his trade  or business of goods or burden  which he           manufactures or repairs, or in which  he deals.

                                      . APPENDIX II.A  Uric) Summary of the Views Expressed  on the  Recommendations contained in Part III of the               Saltcr Report by  various  classes of Representative Associations.     1.  Associations representative  of  Local Authorities. On  the  whole  neutral;  some  urge the  exclusion of local  authorities&apos;  vehicles from  the  scope of the scheme; some press for  an extended  use of  powers to exclude specified types of  vehicles from certain roads.   (The Reportof the Committee on Local Expenditure (paragraph 126) endorsed  the recommendation regardingthe way-bill.)     2.  The Railway Com panics&apos;  Association say  that the conclusions contained in the report were a compromise  to secure unanimity, and  while the Railway Companies themselves would inmany directions have gone beyond the agreed  recommendations,  they wish to make no comment.except to  urge  that  the Minister  will   take  the earliest  possible  steps to  implement  therecommendations as  a whole.     3. . The Interests representative of the transport of goods by road are  on the whole opposedto a licensing system.  They contend that the fitness of vehicles can already be  dealt with underthe Road  Traffic  Act, 1030, and the hours  of drivers are already sufficiently covered by Section 10of that Act.  Some, however,  including the  Conference  of National Organisation interested inRoad Transport,  are prepared  for an extension of  Section 03 of the Road  Traffic Act, which atpresent, applies the Fair Wages Clauses to public  service  vehicle employees,  to  cover the driversof vehicles  of those who hold themselves  out to  carry the goods  of others  for hire or reward:there is fairly general condemnation of the proposal to extend  the Fair Wages Clause  to cover the drivers  of employers  whose use of motor vehicles forms  an ancillary  part of  some other business or  industry.     To establish a  licensing system to secure  these  objects, and to  regulate  the  quantum oftransport  available would, it  is alleged      (1) Be  complex and bureaucratic.     (2) Hamper trade  and industry.     (3) Be  difficult  or impossible to work,  for no licensing authority could ascertain whether          there  is an excess of existing transport facilities suitable to meet the public require-          ments, or whether there is  any congestion  or overloading of the  roads.    The  National  Road  Transport Employers&apos;  Federation,  however,  approve of  a  modifiedlicensing system, which would  be  little more  than registration.  The Road  Haulage  Association.while opposed to the restrictive features of the proposals in the  Report of the Salter Conference,appear to favour a  modified licensing system.     -1.  Trade Unions  preface  their remarks  by suggesting there  will be  no real solution untilall  forms  of transport  are nationally  controlled.   The Railway Unions  and the Transport  andGeneral Workers&apos; Union support a system of licensing  particularly to secure  wages and conditionsof service.     5.  Commercial Interests  are  almost unanimously opposed to a licensing system on thegrounds that it would add to transport costs.o
