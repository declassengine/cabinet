THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  January 1933.CONFIDENTIAL.                                       Copy No.CP.  3 (33).                                CABINET.THE DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE.    1.  THE Bureau of the Disarmament Conference  is to  resume its sittingson Monday, the 23rd January, and the Ceneral Commission is due to meet againa week later.  We have just surmounted the  crisis created by the absence ofGermany  and,  thanks to  the British  lead at  the  Five-Power Conference  lastmonth,  the  German Delegation will be at  Geneva ready  to  take part whenbusiness begins.  There is a fatal temptation  when the crisis is  passed, after theexpenditure of great effort, to regard the improved situation as itself amountingto progress and to imagine that the effort can be relaxed.  In fact, we have onlyaverted disaster;  everything remains to be done; all that has happened is thatwe  are  back where we were in July.  Unless a new direction and an  effectivelead can be given to the Disarmament Conference now, the impetus which it hasreceived from the  return of Germany will  quickly  die away just as happenedafter  the  opening discussions, after the Hoover  proposals,  and after the JulyResolution.  A full-dress debate is followed by the distribution  of various topicsto various committees which are attended by delegates of diminishing importance and responsibility.  Most of these, not having authority to deviate from the pathof rigid instructions, spend their time in elaborating every imaginable technicalobjection  to each proposal which  they are not expressly authorised  to accept.Each  subject becomes overgrown with the tangled difficulties, and every organ ofthe Conference becomes choked.  Unless some new and  more  effective procedure is rapidly set on foot, I anticipate a repetition of these painful phenomena till the Conference reaches a complete standstill, which will convince everybody thatit is  doomed.  A  new programme firmly promoted and boldly pursued  is theonly hope.    2.  But  there is a  new  feature in the situation which adds materially tothe danger of a failure.  Germany has been brought back to the Conference onthe basis of equality of rights, and this concession to German  feeling has been widely  approved   by  world  opinion.   If  all  this results  in  a  reduction  ofarmaments by international agreement on a basis satisfactory to Germany, welland good.  But if  it does not, and if on the contrary the Conference now breaksdown, we  may be sure that Germany will claim that she  is morally entitled torearm;  nobody will be able to prevent ner  doing so; in such circumstances herneighbours will certainly not disarm, and are likely to arm further;  a new racein armaments will be set up with consequences, both to  the peace of Europe andto British expenditure,  which are alarming  to contemplate.   Consequently, inthis situation, it is now  more than  ever  important  to this country that  theDisarmament Conference should reach a satisfactory  conclusion.   Even  though we  iaay entertain grave doubts as to the possibility of achieving success, we are bound to cultivate  optimism and to make the  best effort we can.  Moreover, it isonly by doing our utmost to give the  right lead ourselves that we can escape theverdict, undeserved as it may be, that  it is  our  own shortcomings which have caused the Disarmament Conference  to fail.    3.  In an effort to provide such  a lead, I asked Mr. Cadogan to prepare adraft  &quot;Programme of Work &quot; for the Conference which, if adopted, would takethe place  of  the exceedingly complicated and detailed agenda  which had beensupposed to govern our procedure hitherto.  This is printed  as an  appendix to      6697   [8091]                                                  i3
this paper and I should be glad if I might have general authority, in case of need,to put forward suggestions on these lines as to procedure.    But I have seen mr. Henderson and learnt from him that he is contemplating the putting forward in outline of a new Convention which he hopes will be approved as a basis of work by the Conference.  His draft contains some fourteen articles, the titles of whichcover the ground.   Article 1 deals with the topic of &quot; Security &quot; and article 2with &quot; Equality of Rights.&quot;  The Henderson draft contains many blanks, but itis manifest that if discussion begins promptly on the subject matter of articles 1and 2 we shall get to the heart of the matter pretty soon, with what consequencesI will not venture to predict.                                                    (Initialled)       J. S.    Foreign Office,          January 12, 1933.
APPENDIX.     THE following programme  of  work has  been, for convenience, drawn upin the form of a resolution to be adopted by the General Commission :       The General  Commission decides that the future work  of  the  Conferenceshall be conducted on the following lines, the direction of the work being placedin the hands of the Bureau                                        I.     The aim of the Bureau should be to submit to the General Commission  aConvention  or  Conventions giving effect to the following principles :      (1) All European  States should join in a  solemn  affirmation that they willnot  in any  circumstances  attempt to  resolve  any present or future differences between them by resort to force.     (2) There  shall immediately be  undertaken  a  study  by  the  continentalEuropean States of  the possibility of reaching political  arrangements defining the  conditions in which each of  the States  forming part  of  this Europeanorganisation will be entitled to the co-operation of the other contracting  States.     (3) The limitations on the armaments of  Germany and the  other disarmedStates shall be contained  in the same Disarmament Convention  as  that whichwill define the limitations on the armaments  of others, so that the articles inPart V of the  Treaty  of Versailles which at present limit Germany&apos;s arms and armed forces, and the corresponding provisions  of the other Peace  Treaties, wouldbe replaced by the Disarmament Convention as far as the disarmed States  areconcerned.     (4) The newly-expressed limitations in the case of Germany and the otherdisarmed States would  last for the same period and be subject to the same methodsof revision as those of all  other countries.     The Convention shall  contain an  undertaking on  the part of the SignatoryStates to enter upon   negotiations in  due  course before the  expiry  of thisConvention  with a view to concluding a new  Disarmament Convention for  thepurpose of further adjustment of armaments.     (5) The Convention shall embody, as regards war material, the principle ofqualitative equality, and shall provide for the realisation of such equality, ifnot immediately after  its entry into force, then by specified stages.     As regards the organisation of military forces,  the armies of the continentalEuropean States shall  be reduced to a uniform general type that of a nationalshort-service army with  limited  effectives.                                    II.A. Security.    The Political Commission shall be  instructed at once to study the methodsof giving effect to point (1) above.    A  Committee  of the European continental States shall  be immediatelyconstituted to examine point  (2) above.B. Disarmament,    (a)  Effectives. The Bureau shall at once undertake the following work :       (i) In accordance with the plan for the calculation of land forces contained          in the proposals of President Hoover, compute the totals of personnel          of the &quot; police component&quot; (the irreducible component) of the existing-          land  forces of each  country, both metropolitan and  overseas.  For          this purpose it shall instruct the Effectives Committee to  make to it          within   days recommendations  concerning the ratios  to be employed          in  this calculation.  If within  that time the  Effectives  Committee          has been  unable  to reach a  unanimous recommendation, it must          report fully to  the Bureau the  state  of  its discussions, and it  will          be for the  Bureau  to take a definite decision.      [8091]                                                      B 2
                            Notes on the foregoing draft Resolution.I (2).          It will be noted that in Part I above, no mention is made of the Consultative      v  Pact perhaps the most important feature of the French Plan.  The omission is         due to the warning given us by Mr. Davis that to discuss this now might only put         matters back.  The French would understand this well enough, and might consent         to begin work on other matters, reserving this question  for  a  more propitious         moment, which may occur some time this year.     (ii)  Agree upon the percentage  by which the  &quot;defence component&quot;  (the          excess over the &quot; police component&quot;) of each State shall be reduced,          such reduction to be effected by a certain date or dates to be specified.    (iii)  Determine the stages and methods by which European continental long-          service armies may be transformed into national short-service armies.          For the discussion of this point, the Bureau may require the Effectives          Committee  to submit recommendations.    (b) Land war material. The Bureau shall       (i)  Fix the maximum  tonnage for tanks to be retained with  the armies           this limit not in any case to exceed 16 tons.     (ii)  Decide as to the disposal of tanks exceeding  that limit whether  they          shall be scrapped, and, if so, the  dates by which such scrapping must          have been effected.    (iii)  Fix the numbers of tanks, not exceeding the tonnage limit,  to be allowed          to each army.    (iv)  Fix the maximum calibre of  mobile land guns such calibre not in  any          case to exceed 4 - 5 inches.     (v)  Decide as to the disposal of  mobile land guns  exceeding that calibre           whether they shall be scrapped,  and, if so, the dates by which such          scrapping must have been effected.    (vi)  Decide whether there shall  be a limitation of the  numbers of mobile          land guns of allowed calibre.    (c) A it. The Bureau shall at once constitute a committee of representativesof the  principal Air Powers to examine the  possibility of the entire abolition ofmilitary  and naval machines  and of  bombing from the air, combined with an effective international control of civil aviation.  As a preliminary to the decisionto be taken by the Committee of Air Powers, the Bureau shall at once       (i)  Fix the maximum unladen weight of military and naval aircraft^this          limit not  in any case to exceed 3 tons.     (ii)  Decide as to the disposal of machines exceeding that limit whether          they shall be scrapped, and, if so, the dates  by which scrapping must          have been effected.    (iii)  Fix the numbers of machines not  exceeding the unladen  weight limit          which may be allowed to each State.    (d) IS!aval Forces. The Bureau shall fix the maximum tonnage and maximumcalibre of gun for       (i)  Capital ships.     (ii)  Aircraft carriers (if these are allowed to be retained or replaced).    (iii)  Cruisers.    (iv)  Destroyers.     (v)  Submarines  (if  these are allowed to be retained or replaced).    The  Bureau shall request the five principal Naval Powers to meet together atonce to discuss the possibility of completing the Treaty of London, thus regulating the naval situation as between them until the end of 1936, or, alternatively, toagree upon  limitation figures  for  a  longer term  covering  the period  of  theDisarmament  Convention.            .    On receipt of a report of the results of  this meeting of the  five Powers, the bureau shall add to their number representatives of the other Naval Powers forthe purpose  of agreeing  on  limitation figures  for   all Signatories  of  theConvention.
o     These limits would probably for the moment have to correspond more or less  II (&amp;)to existing figures,  but the  Bureau  might  propose  progressive  percentage  (Hi).reductions.  If these reductions were sufficiently important and were to be realisedwithin  measurable time, Germany and  the  other  disarmed  States  might  berestrained from constructing tanks.     It would be necessary that Germany should be represented on the Committee  H (c).of principal Air Powers.  She has not, of course, a  military or naval air force,but her civil aviation is developed to such a point that she would be more directly affected, perhaps, than any other  State by proposals  for  the control  of civilaviation.  Moreover, this is a proposal  which she has consistently opposed, andit would be necessary to induce her consent to it.  She would  therefore have to beincluded in the Committee  on  the ground of her very large direct interest in  thequestion.     Mention has been made in the Resolution  of the  possibility of abolishingbombing from the air, and  no  reservation has been made as was done in  the caseof the proposals of the 17th November, allowing for bombing for police purposes in outlying places.  It seems no more necessary at this stage for us  in a documentof this kind to insert such  a reservation than it would be to make allowance  forthe demand which is to be expected from the French for the consideration of their proposal for an  international  air force.  Any conditions that  we may wish to demand to safeguard our rights in this respect would have to be made in  theCommittee of Air Powers itself.     With regard to the numerical limitation of military and naval aircraft  the  n (C)process we have in mind is to bring the principal air Powers down to  our level  (iij).and  then to make an all-round cut of 33Jj per cent.  It is not very easy to wordsuch a provision  so as to make it acceptable.  Mr. Norman Davis  in  his short-term draft convention had one good idea; he took as basis for calculating the  cutexisting machines under a  certain age, i.e., the figure for each country would betaken to be the number of machines which it at present possesses under that age,minus 33  per cent.   He explained that our Air Force, though weaker in numbers,was  probably more up to date than most others.   I believe this is certainly  thecase as regards the French Air Force.  The French never scrap anything (cf. theirancient vessels),  but they should not be allowed to claim bloated  figures on  thestrength of that.  I  do not know whether a  rule of this kind could be applied soas to bring us near parity in existing figures with the other principal air Powers.     Of course we should meet  with considerable difficulties from the French overa programme  like the foregoing.   It does  not  keep to their plan.  The chiefdifference is that in their  plan they do not contemplate the disappearance  orapparently the reduction of war material.  But we should find great difficulty in accepting their &quot; ear-marking &quot; or  &quot; stocking &quot;  provisions.    If we press themfirmly, we might induce them to abandon some of their material.   There  are signs [e.g., recent articles by M. Leon Blum)  that some Frenchmen at least realise that  their defence works will only really be effective if heavy material and military aircraft cannot be brought against them.  The French have everything to gainand  nothing to lose by the abolition of such weapons so far as the  defence  ofFrance is concerned.   And unless they abandon them the Germans will have them.    As regards effectives, again, the French annual contingent will, in 1934 and1935, owing to the decline in births during the later  war years, be reduced by, Ithink,  something over 25 per  cent.   Consequently, their standing  army will  bereduced by  the  same proportion, unless they increase  the  period of militaryservice, which they are hardly likely to do.   Would  it not be better for them tomake a virtue  of  necessity by agreeing now to a reduction ?    If any programme on the  above lines were adopted it would be necessary  forus to be prepared with delegates who could attend the Political Commission,  theCommittee of Air Powers and  the Five-Power Naval  Discussions.                                            (Signed)      A. CADOGAN.    January 12,  1933.
