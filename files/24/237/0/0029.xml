MEMORANDA  for instructions  TO  HIS  MAJESTY&apos;S  AMBASSADOR   AT               WASHINGTON. FEBRUARY 1933.          (As approved by the Cabinet on February 13, 1933.)  I.  General. II.  Settlement of the War Debt to the  United States of America.         Memorandum by the Treasury.III.  Economic Problems. Memorandum  by the Treasury,  covering  a        Statement of Economic Policy for Sir R. Lindsay&apos;s use.    1.   HIS Majesty&apos;s Government by their message of the 24th January have said that they are happy to accept the invitation of Mr. Roosevelt indicating that he would like to receive &quot; a representative or representatives of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment at Washington as soon as possible after the 4th March.&quot;  We know from Sir Ronald1 Lindsay&apos;s full account of his conversation with Mr. Rooseveltat Warm Springs on the 29th January, that he then expressed the hope that theBritish  &quot; Number 2 man  &quot; might be ready to do business with  him  there by the6th March and that &apos;&apos; in ten days or so sufficient progress will have been achievedfor the Prime Minister to  come out in person and finish matters off.&quot;  It is obvioustherefore that one of the  first matters on which Mr. Roosevelt  will  expect to beinformed by Sir Ronald Lindsay when they meet on the 20th February is whetherthis programme, as regards both time-table and personnel, is  approved.   other documents are being prepared by way of instructions to the Ambassador as tothe language and arguments he should employ  on war  debts and various othertopics  which have been  mentioned  to him by Mr.  Roosevelt.  The  present memorandum is limited  to suggestions as to   how the proposals  in point ofprocedure should be handled.    2.   Sir  Ronald Lindsay has three tasks to perform, as  the result of his visit to London, when he sees Mr.  Roosevelt :-    First, it will be his duty to convey to the President-Elect the warm satisfac-tion of  His  Majesty&apos;s Government at the comprehensiveness of Mr. Roosevelfsprogramme.   In addition  to settling the debt question, Mr. Roosevelt contemplatesthe active co-operation of the United States with us in seeking solutions for a1.  GENERAL.[8203]1!
wide range of current world  problems and His  Majesty&apos;s Government entirelyshare his views as to their essential  interdependence.  As the Report  of  theCommission  of  Experts  prepared for  the World  Monetary  and  EconomicConference declares (page 7 of the Draft Annotated Agenda) :  &quot; It is essentialthat the problem of inter-Governmental indebtedness should be settled and that settlement  should relieve the world of  further anxiety concerning the disturbing-effects of such payments upon financial, economic and currency stability.   until there is such a  settlement, or the  definite prospect of such a settlement, thesedebts will remain an insuperable barrier to economic and financial reconstruction.&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government  agree with  Mr.  Roosevelt  that a comprehensivetreatment of a wide range of problems is necessary if real progress is to be made and real solutions reached.  And they look  forward with lively satisfaction tothe prospects of Anglo-American co-operation  for the good,  not only of the  twocountries, but  of the whole world.    Secondly,  as regards the  specific  problem  of debts, the  Ambassador  should speak with complete candour  as to the clear impressions which he has derivedfrom his visit to England of the attitude,  not only of His Majesty&apos;s Government,but of British  public opinion as a whole on the debt question.  The elaboratematerial as to this will of course be in his hands  in another memorandum. Thisreally involves  not only  disabusing Mr. roosevelt&apos;s mind of his first idea thatthe debt problem can be solved on the lines he  has  indicated, but also  settingbefore him the essential  limitations which govern the  possibility of a settlement.by  agreement.   In this connection, he will of course emphasise  that, without seeking in any  way to treat  the  United States  as  a partner in the LausanneAgreements,  it  is   none  the  less   an  essential  of  British   policy,  notin  the  interests of  the United   Kingdom  alone,  but  in   the  interestsof  world   recovery  as  a   whole,    that  the  arrangement  reached  with america on debts should  not conflict with or put in jeopardy the LausanneAgreements. Lausanne  is  the European contribution  to world recovery, and, asthe Preparatory Commission  of Experts  to the World Conference indicated intheir report (page 6)  the Lausanne Agreement is in the nature of an armistice,which cannot  be sacrificed and  must  become the basis of permanent European peace.   The Ambassador should make it entirely clear that no amount of argumentor  pressure could alter  this fundamental condition.   And he should point out.that this is not merely  the declared policy of  His Majesty&apos;s Government, fromwhich they could not  depart, but it would be entirely impossible to persuade theBritish House of Commons notwithstanding the Governments majority to endorseany other course.  No doubt Mr. Roosevelt at present is not completely familiar with the Lausanne settlement and it  will be necessary to  point out  to  him inexplicit terms that inasmuch as the maximum possible German payment amountsto only  715 million dollars the total European payment to America would haveto be reached  in relation to this limitation upon the source  from which  Europecan draw.     Thirdly,  after  the  above  two   topics have been  sufficiently  developed.Sir Ronald Lindsay should tell  Mr. Roosevelt that the British Cabinet desire toput these matters most frankly before him for his confidential information  and consideration, since the  utility of the  proposed visit of a British representative and the character of the  representative  chosen  are necessarily affected  by theprospects which these considerations  permit to emerge.  Being  in the heartiestand most sympathetic agreement with the PVesident-Elect in his  conception ofthe work which the United States and Britain must undertake hand in hand for world recovery, we agree to embrace every practical opportunity of preparing totake part.   At the same time, since the part of the problem which  is represented by debt settlement is envisaged by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the  way aboveindicated,  and since this necessarily involves some reconsideration of the possible basis of useful discussion, His Majesty&apos;s Government are bouud, after explainingfrankly their own position, to enquire  of Mr. Roosevelt how far he  considers  thatthis affects his suggested programme.  Sir Ronald Lindsay, if lie is able to see Mr. Roosevelt on the  20th February and following days, will be able to communi-cate Mr. roosevelt&apos;s reactions in time  for a decision to be taken by  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, say, in the early days of  March, as  to the best way in which to  take-advantage of  the opportunity of a personal exchange  of views at Washington.
    3.  It may be assumed that in the course of the conversation between  the ambassador and Mr. Roosevelt the latter  will be anxious for any indications asto the provisional intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government as to time-table andselection of a representative if Mr. Roosevelt continues to encourage the projectedvisit.  As to this, the Ambassador will make it quite plain that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have not reached a decision and will not do so until they learn ofMr. roosevelt&apos;s reaction.  Before deciding to send over a Cabinet representative.His Majesty&apos;s Government would naturally require to be satisfied  oil certain points.  They see the  advantages of sending  over a  Cabinet representative,provided that (a) there is a real prospect of the ensuing conversations justifyingthe use of an envoy of this degree of authority, and  (b) they could be  adequatelysecured  against the set-back which might result if the Mission  was regarded orrepresented as ending in failure because  it did not  end in agreement.   NeitherMr. Roosevelt nor His Majesty&apos;s Government must be let down over the excursion.Consequently, it must be made clear from the start that such a visit is for thepurpose of exchanging views and preparing the ground.   If a British  Ministervisited America, it would be for  the purpose of establishing direct contact withthe President-elect, and of having a preliminary discussion with him;  indeed, itis obvious  that a ten days&apos; visit  could not possibly furnish the  time  for  final agreement over matters covering so wide a field.    4.  As long as the President gains a clear  impression that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, though sympathetic, has reached no decision,  not even a provisionalone, to send a Ministerial  spokesman,  it would be legitimate and useful to leadMr. Roosevelt to consider, in general  terms, what might possibly be the course and trend of discussion if, in the light of the new information as  to His Majesty&apos;governments attitude, he still  encourages  the  idea that a Cabinet  minister should go over.  In this connection the Ambassador should say that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are disposed to think that the relation  of these debt discussions tothe World Economic Conference will require very close attention.  It is for  this very reason that they share Mr. roosevelt&apos;s idea that  any preliminary exchange of views should cover a  wide range  of subjects.  His  majesty&apos;s Government  havealready made it clear  (in  their acceptance  of the 24th January) that  decisions&quot; on matters which constitute the subject of the World Economic Conference andwhich affect other States cannot be reached before discussions take place at that conference.&quot;  But they at the same time  indicated  that they would be  &quot; glad totake the opportunity of exchanging views with Mr.  Roosevelt on these and othermatters in which the two Governments are so closely interested.&quot;  If, therefore,the exchange of views on the debt problem, while clarifying and narrowing the issues, does not provide as promptly as could be wished the materials for an agreed solution of the European debt question, it may  turn out  that  further work onthis subject has to be undertaken side by side with, though not necessarily as partof,, the  meetings of the World  Economic  Conference.   This  may lead to the mention  of a moratorium, but we should  prefer  such mention  to  come fromMr. Roosevelt rather than it should be suggested to  him at this  stage.    5.  What follows in this paragraph is intended for  Sir Ronald Lindsay&apos;&amp;guidance  and  confidential information,  but  not   for  communication to   Mr.Roosevelt,  save so far as Mr. roosevelt&apos;s own comments  appear to make someguarded reference necessary. It is to be remembered that the place of meeting ofthe World Economic  Conference has  been definitely  fixed,  ever  since   last december,  as being London, and that the British Prime Minister was last monthunanimously nominated to be its President (the  proposal  of the organising committee was made by France and seconded by the United States).   Elaboratepreparations are already in course of being made for the reception in London ofthe very large number of representatives and experts involved.   It is,  however,conceivable that Mr. Roosevelt may feel that the prospect of a  transfer of  debtdiscussions to London  would  have disadvantages   from the  point of view of prestige and American  psychology.  If he hints that the coincidence of debt  andeconomic discussions rather suggests to him the possibility of the transfer of theWorld Economic Conference to America, Sir R. Lindsay should know  that in theview  of His Majesty&apos;s Government the presidency of the British Prime  Minister,which has been arranged by the  League of Nations, could not be disturbed  andHis Majesty&apos;s  Government would be  most unwilling to countenance the with-drawal of British leadership at the World Economic  Conference.  It is, of course;.
possible that though the Conference begins in London with an immense assemblageof States,  it will not dispose of all  its varied programme  in one continuoussession.   If  there  is an   interval  between  its  first  and second  sessions,further discussion of debt settlement,  possibly in some  other locality, mightnevertheless proceed during that interval.  We apprehend that the climate of washington would  in &quot;any  case  be quite unsuitable for such a Conference inmidsummer,  and the pressure to hold  the World Economic Conference as early as  is  practicable comes  from  many  quarters.   Indeed,  if it  were  delayedindefinitely we might expect sharp criticisms from independent members of theHouse of Commons and from newspaper comment, but Sir Ronald Lindsay shouldnot reject modifications of the programme of the World Economic Conference asimpossible if the  President-Elect seems to  be thinking  along these lines.  the ambassador will, of course,  exercise great caution in encouraging any changes inthe arrangements for the World Conference, and the matter would have to be left open for report to London when Mr. Roosevelt&apos;s mature reflections on the subject had become available.     6.  His  Majesty&apos;s Government feel  that  in view of the complication of thematters to be discussed at the World  Economic Conference, and the importance-of letting  their treatment follow the  course  which at the time gives the best prospect for co-operation, it will be very  necessary that the inaugural declarationof the incoming President should  not  limit the freedom of action  which heeventually intends to claim  and to exercise.   We feel sure that this is also Mi-.Roosevelt&apos;s view, and we hope that the Ambassador will take advantage of any opportunity that may oiler for bringing this  point to Mr. Roosevelt&apos;s notice.  Anyfurther information which  he may care to request so  that  he may  frame his address with the results he desires will, of course, be most readily forthcoming.     7.  His Majesty&apos;s Government have  succeeded in preventing any informationwhatever  reaching the press as  to the contents of  Mr.  Roosevelt&apos;s previousconversation with the Ambassador, and  the whole matter has been kept withinthe strictest and smallest circle of confidants.  His Majesty&apos;s  Government would propose to follow the same course about the impending interview between the ambassador and  Mr. Roosevelt,  and  are convinced that the best  prospect of useful negotiation will be secured  if nothing is announced from either  Govern-ment until the results of these February  consultations have matured in a definiteArrangement as to the date  and nature of the proposed visit.           February 10, 1933.    II. SETTLEMENT OF THE WAR DEBT TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.                       Memorandum  by the  Treasury.    1.  There are two conditions which require to be fulfilled by any settlement which may be reached with regard to the War Debt to the United  States ofAmerica, viz. :     (a) that  the settlement shall not be such as to involve a reopening  of the           Lausanne Agreement; and    (6) that any future payments by the United Kingdom shall not be more than           can be covered by our receipts from our own debtors.The Lausanne Settlement.    2.  Throughout the  post-war period the question of Reparations has  been a constant menace to European peace and stability.  The settlement of 1921 broke down and led to the occupation of the Ruhr and to the collapse of the mark.  the dawes Plan  which followed was maintained for five years but then had to&apos; bereplaced by the Young Plan, which in turn broke down, and only as the result of
Kxohiinge ink&apos; taken throughout, $3&apos;40 ^ ,t&apos;l. the Hoover moratorium was an immediate crisis averted.  On each occasion the liabilities of Germany have been scaled down, but none of these settlements were final.  Only after prolonged and difficult negotiations was it possible at Lausanne to reach an  agreement accepted by all the different  Governments concerned as reasonable.     But the Lausanne Agreement represents far more than the settlement of the Reparation question.  It represents also a great political effort to obliterate the animosities engendered by the  war and  to  restore an  atmosphere  of peaceful co-operation in Europe. As stated in the Declaration embodied in the Agreement, the signatory Powers had &quot; the firm intention of helping to create a new order, permitting the establishment and development of confidence between the nations in a mutual spirit of reconciliation, collaboration and justice.&quot;  If this settlement were not to be  ratified, the political  reactions,  both  in Germany and between Germany and the rest of Europe, could not be foreseen.     On  the  economic side Lausanne  was equally  important.    The Financial Crisis of 1931 led to the collapse of credit and confidence and sapped commercial enterprise and initiative.  As soon as the Lausanne Agreement was signed, there was a marked, though short-lived, revival of confidence which led  to  an upward trend of both commodity prices  and security prices.  His Majesty&apos;s Government believe that the final  ratification of the Lausanne Agreement will  lead to a real and permanent revival of confidence  : on  the  other hand,  if the  reparations question were to be reopened, confidence  throughout the  world would be further undermined  and the fall in prices  and economic distress of the world Would he accentuated.     The financial effect of the Lausanne Agreement was to provide  that all the Creditor Powers of Germany should receive 5 per cent. Bonds for 3 milliards of Reichsmarks (equivalent to 715  million dollars,  or  210  million at present rates of exchange*), such Bonds not to be marketed for three years, and thereafter only if and when German credit was so completely restored  as to enable  them to be issued at close on par.  Thus the maximum German payment represents an annual charge for 50 years of, say, 39 million dollars ( 11-i-  million), of which  the British share would  under existing Agreements be about one-fifth, less than   2i million per annum. British claims on Europe.     3.  The p re-Lausanne claims of Great Britain  in respect of allied debts and reparations amounted nominally to  48 million sterling a year. viz.. Allied debts  18 million payable in sterling  and German reparations under the Young Plan  21 million payable in gold (equivalent to, say.   30  million sterling at  present rates of exchange).   The British claims on their European Allies were based on the  debtors&apos;  credit alone,  and  this was  made  clear  throughout  the war  debt negotiations  with them.  But under the Young Plan the  payments to  be made to Great Britain by her debtors^ were  to be  recovered by the latter as part of their-own reparation receipts from  Germany.    The European debtor Powers  will almost certainly maintain that they can only reduce their claims on Germany, as proposed  at  Lausanne, if His  Majesty&apos;s Government do  not claim  additional payments from them on their own credit.  If, therefore, His Majesty&apos;s Govern- ment try to  recover  their war  debt claims from France and Italy, these latter Powers will either appeal to the Lausanne settlement and refuse to pay anything more than they  receive under that settlement, or they will refuse to ratify  the Lausanne settlement and claim from Germany whatever is asked from them either by the United Kingdom or by the United States  of America.  In the latter event they are not likely to make effective payments unless  they succeed in obtaining the necessary sums  from  Germany.   But nothing  is  more  certain  than that  the Lausanne settlement  represents the maximum sum that can be obtained  from Germany.     4   The  only solution consistent with  the  Lausanne Agreement would there- fore be that  the United States  of  America should  accept from the whole of its European Debtors sums equivalent to the eventual  proceeds of  the Lausanne Bondb, viz.,  not exceeding  715 million  dollars capital, or  fifty annuities of39 million dollars.
Effect of Reducing Interest Charges to &quot; Italian Terms.&quot;     5.  It has  been suggested that the President-Elect may be prepared to contemplate a reduction of future payments by the United Kingdom government by reducing  interest charges, both past and  future,  to a nominal figure, or bywaiving them altogether.     As an example of reduction of interest to a more or less nominal figure, theapplication of &quot; Italian  terms &quot; to the British debt might be considered.     The Italian debt to the United States  of America was settled  on termsproviding for no interest to be charged until  1930, and thereafter interest to becharged at rates rising from  one-eighth of 1  per cent, for the years 1930-40 to2 per cent, for the years 1980-87.     These rates are equivalent to an average interest rate of 0-4 per cent.,  andif future payments by the United Kingdom to the United States of America werescaled down  to  this basis  we should, if a flat  annuity.were fixed, have to  pay(at the present rate of exchange)  28 million a year for fifty years.  Alternatively.a rising scale of annuities calculated on Italian terms would  involve paymentsrising from  9f million in 1934 to  14f million in 1944,  21^ million in 1954. 29  million in 1964,   38  million in 1974, and  50 million in 1984.     There is clearly no possibility of settling on this basis, without wrecking the lausanne Agreement.     Nor could an acceptable  basis be found  by making the offer retrospective.If we were granted  &quot; Italian terms &quot; from the outset and were given credit forthe excess payments already made, we should still have to pay on a  scale rising from  7  million  in 1934&apos; to  10f million  in 1944,  I5f  million  in 1954. 27f million in 1974 and  37f million in 1987, or alternatively a flat fifty-yearannuity of  18 million a year.Effect of Waiving all Interest Charges.     6.  The  effect of waiving all interest charges, past and future, would be asfollows :      The aggregate capital of  the European War Debts due to the United Statesof America by  the  Creditor Powers of Germany as funded was about 11,000million dollars.  This, however, included a considerable amount of interest whichwas  funded, and if all interest is excluded from  the date of the original advances,the total would be reduced to 9,810  million dollars.   As against this total, thepayments already made under  the  Funding  Agreements (mainly for  interest)amount to 1,720 million dollars.   If all these payments are treated as repayments of capital, the amount now outstanding is 8.090 million dollars.   To repay  this in fifty years without interest requires fifty annuities of 162 million. dollars ascompared with  the maximum of 39 million dollars a year that is equivalent towhat Germany may be required to pay under the Lausanne Agreement.  Thuseven  if all interest,  past and  future, were to be waived the debtors  of america would still remain liable  for payments to the United States of America equivalentto 4J times the maximum amount which could be received by them under the lausanne Agreement.     7  Even therefore  if all interest, both  before  and  after  funding, were entirely eliminated, the  &quot; all-round &quot; settlement could only be obtained  if theburden on Germany were  increased over fourfold and made definite instead ofcontingent.  This is clearly impossible.Further Possible Reductions.     8.  It will  therefore be necessary not only  to eliminate all interest, whether before or after funding,  but also to secure a further substantial reduction of theclaims of the United States of America if those claims are to be brought down toa figure which can be reconciled with the Lausanne settlement.     9.  One argument which might  be used is  that the British debt obligationsshould be. further scaled down in proportion to the depreciation of  sterling, whichhas  greatly affected  the  burden of the British debt.   But  this argument wouldnot apply to the Continental Powers, whose position also has to be considered ifa general  settlement is to be reached.
    10.  An alternative  procedure  would he  to  reduce the  capital  debt  in proportion to the  fall in  world prices.  It is well known that the bulk of thewar debts were incurred  in the purchase of commodities  at the inflated  price-levels  ruling  towards  the  end  of  the  War.   Prices  have  since  fallen  by approximately one-half; thus repayment at the original price  involves doubling the liability in  terms of present-day value of goods.    In this event, of course, the repayments already made, as well as the originalcapital debt,  would have to be adjusted in accordance with the price level  at the relevant dates.   This has been done in the calculations which follow :-     Settlement on the basis of (1) No interest; find (2) Allowance for the                               fall  in prices.    In the case of the United  Kingdom-             Million       Million                                                   dollars.        dollars.        The Capita 1 Debt of  ...       ...       ...    4,277             is scaled down to ...       ...       ...      ...          1,972        The repayments  of    ...       ...       ...    1.447           ...             are scaled down  to...       ...       ...      ...          1.067                 Leaving a net. debt of     ...      ...           905In the other cases (added together)     The Capital  Debts of  ...       ...       ...    5,533        are scaled down to...       ...       ...                  2 840    The repayments of    ...       ...               273        are scaled down to...       ...       ...                   ig2                     Leaving a net debt of      ...      ...          2.658    Assuming that repayment without  interest  is spread over fifty years, the annuities due by each Power would be                Million                                                      dollars.             The United Kingdom      ...              .18  ( 5-i million)             France   ...      ...       ...      ...       29             Italy     ...      ...       ...      ...       18             Belgium and Minor Powers...      ...        6                                                        71    11.  Even this figure is very considerably more than the maximum receivablefrom Germany viz. :  39 million  dollars and some further adjustment would still be required.  How  such an adjustment could be obtained is a  matter forfurther discussion, but at least, in view of the disproportionate amounts already paid by Great Britain, as  compared  with the other debtors, it is clear that  hbfurther burden  should  be imposed  on  this country in connection therewith.    12.  Assuming  that some acceptable scheme could be  evolved, the  most satisfactory plan would be for Great  Britain to forego  future  receipts from europe and be absolved from future payments to the United States of America,and to leave the United  States of America to settle with France, Italy, &amp;c,  onthe basis of the payments to be made by Germany under the Lausanne Agreement.    Such an arrangement would not of course mean that, over the wdiole period.the British receipts from  reparations  and allied war debts  have covered thepayments made in respect of the British War Debt to America.  On the contrary,before  the  Hoover Moratorium, the aggregate  British payments had amountedto  326 million, against aggregate  receipts from reparations (including deliveries in kind, &amp;c),  and  allied war debts  of  192 million,  leaving  a  deficit  oi 134 million.  If interest at 5 per  cent,  is added to both sides of the account, the deficit  would be about  200 million;  and this deficit has since  been increased bythe payment of  30 million sterling  made on the 15th December, 1932.  Thus,the United Kingdom borrowed from the United States  850 million;  she herselflent to the  Allies  1,600 million, and had large claims on Germany for repara-
tions.  She has, in fact, paid on her debt to the United States all that she hasreceived from reparations and War Loans together (viz.,  192 million), and overand above that a further  164 million capital,  excluding  interest.     13.   Alternatively, revised  settlements might be made between the UnitedStates of  America and each of  its debtors within the limits of their  respectiveshares of  the Lausanne payments, each debtor  power being responsible for its share of the total payments to be made.     (Such payments to the United States of America  would,  of course,  be conditional on equivalent payments being forthcoming from Germany.)     14.   The fact is that the United States of America and the United  kingdom are co-creditors of a bankrupt world, and a settlement has  to be reached betweenthem on the basis of what can be recovered from their joint  debtors.  If theUnited States Government are  not  prepared to  reach  a settlement  with HisMajesty&apos;s Government  on this basis, His Majesty&apos;s  Government will be  facedwith tne  choice  between two  alternatives: either  to maintain  the  LausanneAgreement in Europe and suspend payments to America  pending the negotiation of a general settlement on the basis of that Agreement, or to make the paymentsrequired by the United States of America, but  at the same time  to recover any payments thus made from their debtors in Europe, with incalculable consequenceson European financial and political stability.  It will be quite impossible for HisMajesty&apos;s Government to contemplate a continuance of payments by them to theUnited States without recovery  from their own debtors in Europe;  and  it isequally impossible for  them to contemplate a breakdown of the  Lausanne settle-ment.  In  these circumstances, if an impasse is  to  be  avoided,  they  can  onlysuggest that the United States Government should agree  to a moratorium of war debt payments pending a  general discussion with all  the signatories of the lausanne Agreement as to the best means of arriving at a settlement of the wholequestion,  which  would  satisfy the requirements of the  United States withoutundermining the efforts at reconstruction made by the European Powers.                         III. ECONOMIC PROBLEMS.  Memorandum by the Treasury covering a Statement of Economic Policy for                            Sir R. Lindsay&apos;s use.    15.  It has been suggested that the United States President  may  find itdifficult to present a debt settlement to Congress unless, in appearance at least,it is accompanied by concessions on the part of Great Britain.  We have as yet no clear idea what concessions may be proposed,  and  in  all probability  theAmerican ideas are still in a very fluid  state.  Vague references have been madeto concessions on disarmament, but it seems almost certain that  as discussionsdevelop the tendency will be to concentrate on     (a) The return of Great Britain and other countries to the gold standard;    lb) Commercial concessions by  Great Britain to the United States;    (C) Measures,  especially by the  Government of India, to increase the price of           silver.    16.  The   restoration  of an  international  monetary  standard  (afterappropriate conditions have been fulfilled), the freeing of international commerceby moderating tariffs and by abolishing quota and exchange restrictions, and thespecial position of silver were all discussed at the recent meeting at Geneva of thePreparatory Committee for the World Conference.   Some progress was made inlaying down principles which were acceptable to the United  States experts aswell as to ourselves, and  on many points the  views of the United States andBritish experts were more closely in accord than those of other countries.   But itshould be borne in mind that tHe United States experts were not  Governmentalrepresentatives.    17.  The  recommendations of the Preparatory  Committee can only be implemented as a result of real co-operation by all the principal countries of theworld.  Agreement between the United States, Great  Britain and France is, in
 any case,  indispensable.  Nevertheless,  a  preliminary survey of the agenda  in consultation with the United States Government is exactly what we  should have wished for in ordinary circumstances.  We should also desire similar consulta- tions with the French and some other Governments before the Conference meets.     18.   But  the whole  position is  complicated  by  the dispute on war debts. Whereas we most heartily desire to  co-operate with  the United States Govern- ment on the questions arising out of  the Agenda,  the whole position  is distorted if such consultation is represented as meaning concessions, to our detriment and to the advantage of the United States, intended as a quid,  pro quo to a reduction of war debts.     19.   In our opinion, what we should aim at is an  agreed programme of co-operation between us and  the United States with  a view to saving our two countries and the world at large from disaster.     20.   The draft statement of British Policy on economic problems contained in paragraphs 24  to 38  below has  been  prepared with  a view to indicating what could  be said  to the United States Government.  If  it is  read closely it will be apparent  how little there is  which could  plausibly be  represented as a quid pro quo for debt reduction.  A  very early  return of Great Britain to the gold standard is much the more  important object in the eyes of the United States, though they have  long since abandoned any hope that we shall return at the old par.  We also envisage a return to the gold  standard, but the essential difference between our viewpoint and that of the United States is that  they regard the return of Great Britain to gold as a first step to world recovery  from which all  other results are to  flow, whereas we envisage our return to  gold as the culmination of a long process of reform and reconstruction in world conditions.     21.  It  would be injudicious on our part  to introduce  the  question  of temporary stabilisation of sterling, though no doubt the Americans may raise it. While we could indicate our strong desire to limit fluctuations in exchange due to purely speculative  influences, it  is certain that we should not satisfy them on this  point either.     22.  As regards  Anglo-American tariff discussions, our exports of domestic products to the United States in 1932 were only  15  million and it is obviously a question of asking  for concessions from  them rather than making  concessions ourselves.    23.  As regards silver which is much more a matter for the Indian Govern- ment than for ourselves, certain promises of co-operation might possibly be made; but in reality the demand of the United States silver producers is that the Indian and other Governments shall be prohibited from selling surplus silver in order that  silver producers  may increase their own production.  It is certain that theIndian Government could not be expected  to entertain  so one-sided an arrange-ment (see paragraph 35).  STATEMENT OF  BRITISH POLICY ON  ECONOMIC PROBLEMS.    24.  His  Majesty&apos;s Government  warmly welcome  the suggestion of  thePresident-Elect that concurrently with the discussion of War Debts there shouldbe a discussion of World Economic problems in which the two Governments aremutually interested.   It is a matter of vital moment to the peoples of the UnitedKingdom, as it is to the people of the United States of  America, to  counteract the present world depression, to relieve the constant pressure of  unemployment,.to restore the level of prices and to revive prosperity.  It becomes more and moreclear that the operation of normal economic forces cannot be relied upon to bring this about in any reasonable period and that  positive action by Governments is called for to expedite it.  But in fact the efforts made by each Government up tothe present time have been singularly ineffective and there is growing impatienceon  the part of the  ordinary man  and woman in all countries at the apparentinability of their Government to master the blind forces which seem to be working;
relentlessly to a general breakdown of the financial, economic and social structure of society.  The fact is that the  depression cannot be effectively  remedied byisolated  action on the part of individual Governments : it is essentially inter-national in its character and requires for its solution  international action on avery broad front.  It will therefore be necessary to secure concerted measures onthe part of all the principal countries of the world and the  World Monetary andEconomic Conference offers an opportunity for devising such measures.  But itwould greatly help  towards success in that Conference  if the attitude of HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the United States President were similar towards the objectives to be promoted at the Conference, and His Majesty&apos;s Government fortheir part  will gladly enter into an exchange of views to this end.     25.  The Report and Agenda for the World Conference, recently elaboratedby the Preparatory Commission of experts  appointed by  the League of Nations.affords a useful basis for this discussion.  The Report of the  Commission, acceptedunanimously by eminent experts of seventeen different countries, including all theprincipal countries of  Europe, the United States  of  America, the Argentine,China and India, as well as by representatives of the Bank for  international settlements and other international institutions, sets out in a clear and conciseform the actual position and  the programme which the Governments have to face.followed by  an annotated  agenda summarising the  detailed issues involved.Taking this programme  as  the basis. His Majesty&apos;s Government propose  toindicate  the general lines on  which they would  envisage co-operation between theUnited States of America  and the United Kingdom in promoting a solution of theworld economic problems.Rise in the Level of Prices.    26.  It is accepted in all  quarters that an increase  in the general  level of world  prices-and, more particularly,  in  the prices of farm commodities -is highly desirable.   His Majesty&apos;s Government are in entire agreement with thisview and have repeatedly declared that it is one of the main objects of their policy to secure a rise in wholesale prices, especially in the wholesale prices of foodstuffs and raw materials, not  only  in Great Britain but throughout the world.  Whilethe export trade of Great  Britain is mainly in manfactured goods, His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment are convinced that no real prosperity can be secured by the manu-facturing interests until the  primary producers in all countries are  once more  ina position to recommence normal purchases.    A vivid sketch of the existing price situation is given in the introduction  tothe Report of the Preparatory  Commission.   Wholesale  commodity  prices  ingeneral have  fallen  by over one-third  since October 1929,  while  raw material prices  have dropped by from 50 to  60 per cent, since that  date.   The remedial measures which appeared to the Preparatory Commission to  deserve considerationare mentioned on page 8  of the  Agenda,  while a fuller  analysis  is given on pages 18 to 20.    27.  Monetary action is, in the view of  His Majesty&apos;s Government, necessaryto secure a rise in prices.  It is a question  whether monetary action is sufficientby itself to raise  prices without long delay, which the condition  of the worldhardly permits, but that does not alter the fact that monetary action is necessaryto create the  conditions in which  a prica rise can take place.  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment  believe that  many valuable &apos; results  have  been achieved  by themeasm*es taken both in the United States of America  and in London to ensurethe provision of cheap and abundant short-term money, but on the other hand, theyare convinced that well co-ordinated action between the  leading Central Banksis likely  to have more effect  in improving world conditions than isolated effortsby particular countries.  His Majesty&apos;s Government would be happy  to co-operate in any measures which the United States  Government might think  well designedto secure this object.    28.  Monetary action,  however, operates only  to increase the supply of credit, and simultaneous action is  required to increase the demand.   Monetaryaction would require to  be supplemented therefore by action to restore the purchasing power of debtor countries, to promote international trade and  in somecases to regulate production.   All these interconnected problems are dealt with  inthe Agenda  and  must receive  detailed consideration  at the World  Economic
Conference.  The concerted action of many countries is required for success, but,as  already  indicated,  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  are  of  opinion that  a preliminary survey by the two Governments would be most helpful.Stabilisation of Currencies.    29.  Among the  difficulties confronting  international  trade a  prominentplace must be assigned to currency disorganisation.  The  world crisis whichcommenced in the Autumn of 1929 has now lasted for more than three years.For the first two years of that period practically the whole world remained on thegold standard.  But the continued disastrous  fall in prices  and the steady and rapid diminution in trade made currency breakdown inevitable. With the inter-national economic system in course of rapid destruction it was impossible that aninternational currency system should survive.  Very  few countries  now retainfree gold standard currency systems. A large number have  remained nominallyattached to gold, but only by imposing restrictions which are  destructive of tradeand financial intercourse between nations.  Other countries have abandoned thegold standard.    30.  A general return to  an  international monetary  standard would  be welcomed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, but  they fear that this will not  be apractical possibility until some  degree  of health has been restored to the inter-national economic system.   The experience  of the first two years of the crisisindicated   the  defective conditions under  which  the  international  monetarystandard then worked, while the struggle of so many countries to remain attachedto that standard by the adoption of deflationary measures and by placing growingrestrictions on trade  was  a powerful  factor  in accelerating the  collapse.   Ageneral return to the gold standard, so long as that is only possible by deflationarymeasures or by imposing fresh restrictions on trade could but do harm.    On the other hand, provided that a  reasonable degree of equilibrium betweenprices and costs can be restored  and the defects which have shown themselves iii the working  of  the  Gold Standard  are  removed by  suitable  international co--operation, His Majesty&apos;s Government, as at present advised, see no reason whythe way should not be open to  the re-establishment of an international system.Exchange Controls.    31.  The Exchange controls recently imposed by  many countries and the clearing and compensation agreements to which they have given rise, have proved.a most serious obstacle to international trade.   His Majesty&apos;s Government would gladly co-operate with the  Government  of the  United  States in pressing for theabolition of all such measures.   It must be recognised, however, that many of thecountries which have adopted these controls will plead their inability to remove.&quot;them, unless they are  first  assured  against a collapse of their currencies by theprqyjsion of additional foreign exchange reserves or by the readjustment of theirexternal commercial debts.   The United Kingdom and the  United . States  ofAmerica have in the  past been  the largest  international capital markets, andthey have  common  interests in  securing that  these  difficulties are wisely dealtWith.   Owing to the collapse  of confidence,  it  is hardly to be  expected that the flow of international  capital  can be resumed in the near future through  theordinary market channels, and it may be  necessary to contemplate special measures(such  as have been set on  foot  in  the  United States  for  internal purposes)  tofacilitate  the  revival of international credit.   Any such action  would largely depend  on  the possibility of securing co-opex-ation between Central Banks, witha view  to putting into circulation  resources which  are at present immobilised.and the precise method by which this could  best be done would require careful investigation by the  financial authorities of  the principal  creditor  countries.His Majesty&apos;s Government would willingly associate themselves with the UnitedStates Government in furthering such  an investigation,  as  it appears to themthat a  restoration  of world  prices must depend  in a  large measure on  thepossibility  of restoring the purchasing power of the  debtor countries, whether in Europe or overseas.Relaxation of Trade Barriers.    ,32.  The Preparatory Commission points out that one of  the most significantfeatures of the present crisis. is the fair which has taken place not only&apos;in the,&apos;
value but in the quantum ot  international trade.  Apart from exchange controls,the principal reason for this  fall seems to be the growing network of quantitative restrictions on international trade  in the  form of prohibitions and quotas on imports which have recently been imposed.    These restrictions on imports have proved a far  greater obstacle  to  inter-national trade than  any tariffs, and His  Majesty&apos;s  Government would gladlyco-operate with the United States Government in pressing for a general agreementwith a view to their relaxation and their abolition  as soon as possible, particularly as regards manufactures.  As regards farm products, and particularly meat anddairy products, exceptional  measures may  be required to cope with the presentglut,  and the possibility  of  relaxation will depend largely on the possibility of ensuring a better regulation  of production (see paragraph 36 below).Tariffs.    33.   His Majesty *s  Government would also favour a general agreement forthe reduction of tariffs and for the maintenance of a more moderate tariff policyin the future.  They have in the past supported the most unconditional  interpre-tation of the most-favoured-nation  clause,  and their existing treaty obligationsrender it difficult for them to accept proposals which  might conflict with most-favoured-nation rights.   They would, however, be ready to consider co-operationwith  the United  States with  a  view  to  securing  (a)  a general  Gentleman&apos;s agreement under which  no country  would  increase its actual tariffs above theirexisting level pending the outcome of  the  Conference, and (b)  an  arrangement for the gradual reduction of high protective tariffs to a more moderate level.  Asregards any tariff truce, it must be remembered that the British tariff represents acomparatively  low measure  of protection and it  would not be  possible for  HisMajesty&apos;s Government  to tie their  hands for an indefinite period by  adoptingan  arrangement which stereotypes the  existing position.  As regards reductionof tariffs, it must be  borne in mind that the national  budgets of many  countriesdepend on high revenue  duties on spirits, tobacco  and other  luxuries.A riglo-A merican Tariff Discussions.    34.   As regards direct American trade with  this country, it is obvious fromthe figures that His Majesty&apos;s Government are  not in  a position to  offer  anysubstantial advantages over and above those which America  already enjoys.  Forthe year 1931  British imports from the United States of America amounted to 104 million, while the exports of British domestic products to the United states were   18 million;  for  the year  1932 British  imports from America were 84 million, and domestic exports  only  15  million.   There  is, therefore,  an enormous excess of United  States exports to this country over British exportsto the United  States.  As it  is essential to restore equilibrium in the balance ofpayments if sterling is  to be stabilised, the United Kingdom can obviously not afford to buy larger quantities of United States  goods unless the United Statesoffer  greatly increased   outlets  for the manufactures  of  this country.    HisMajesty&apos;s Government will,  however, gladly enter into discussions, if  and whenthe United. States so desire,  with a  view to concluding a tariff agreement on thebasis of reciprocity.Silver.     35.   As  regards silver,  the Preparatory ^Commission  point out  that such schemes as  bimetallism, &amp;c, are  impossible  of  adoption,  and His  Majesty\sGovernment assume  that the United States concur in this view.  The Expertsalso agreed  that what is required  is not  a rise  in the price of silver as such(which would  involve great  economic difficulties  for the silver-using countries,particularly China), but a rise in  the general  level of commodity  prices whichwould bring up the value of silver at the same time.  The criticism levelled againstthe Indian Government  in connection with silver is largely due to misapprehen-sion.   The Government  of India has made no radical alteration in its currencysystem during the last  forty years, but  it has been greatly embarrassed by thesurplus  silver flowing  into  its reserves following upon  the  fall in  commodity prices.  It would not be possible for the Government of India to agree to restrictsales of silver from these reserves while there was no similar restriction on salesby the silver producers.   It  may be pointed out that in fact, on  balance, over thelast few years the Government of India has increased, not  decreased,  the  stocksof  silver held in it^ reserves. The most that could be said on this subject is that
the Government of India have expressed their readiness to discuss an arrange-ment with the silver producers with a view to some general regulation of sales of silver.Regulation of Production.     3b\  While the regulation of production has many critics,  it appears to 11 i  ;Majesty&apos;s Government that some measure of this kind may be justified and helpful in the case of certain primary materials, especially where large stocks are over-hanging the market.  Regulation schemes  are  already in existence  for sugar and tin, and His  Majesty&apos;s Government are proposing to call a Conference inorder to secure an agreement for the regulation of&apos; production in the meat trade.They are also contemplating further agreements  in respect of  dairy produce.     As regards wheat. His Majesty&apos;s Government are not directly interested, asthe United Kingdom is an importing country, but they agree that the EconomicConference should consider the possibility of&apos;an international agreement betweenthe  main producing countries for a restriction of acreage in  those countriescoupled with a reduction in the excessive tariffs  on  wheat now imposed in someof the more important consuming countries.     37.  In this connection His Majesty&apos;s  Government would like to point outthe particular interest which they have  in seeking to  put the  shipping industry on  a more economic basis.  At the present  time  the subsidies  to shipping givenby many countries has led to the construction and the working  of a much greatertonnage than is required by existing international trade, so that in many countriesshipping has become a burden on the national economy, instead of a contributionto  its prosperity.  They will welcome  the co-operation  of the  United StatesGovernment in securing a remedy for this situation.     38.  His Majesty&apos;s  Government have here outlined the objectives which theywould aim at securing by the Woiid Economic Conference, and they trust thatthe Government of the  United States will find it possible to support similarobjectives.  But it is essential to stress throughout that any hope of arriving atbetter conditions  is dependent on a satisfactory settlement of the War Debtsquestion having been reached, or at least assured.   The existence  of these debtsconstitutes, as the Preparatory Commission have said, an insuperable barrier to continue and financial  reconstruction, and there is no  prospect  of  the world economic Conference making progress if this barrier  cannot be removed.    39.  The above review of the situation shows that a settlement both of war debts  and  of  the other economic  problems necessarily  entails  international co--operation, not only between the United States and the United Kingdom,  butbetween  all the principal  countries of the world.   The difficulties  of making progress on any one problem are very great, but the Governments would not beforgiven by their peoples if they failed to make the most resolute efforts to arriveat solutions in the common interest.  His Majesty&apos;s Government would greatlyprefer a settlement to be reached of War Debts  in the first instance, as this is aquestion which is under the immediate control of certain Governments, and they believe that  its settlement would  very greatly  promote progress on  the  widereconomic questions.  But if a settlement  satisfactory to both Governments is atpresent unattainable, His  Majesty&apos;s  Government would be prepared  to discussall the factors of the present world crisis, including war debts, concurrently.   Inthat event they would, if  necessary, suggest that the discussion  of  war debtsshould be postponed until  the World Economic Conference&quot;ence is held, and that itshould be carried on concurrently with that Conference.   In  the view of HisMajesty&apos;s Government it would be essential  if the Conference is  to achieve any measure of success that it should be free from the menace of a possible reopening of Reparations, and, in  the absence  of prior agreement as to  debts,  they trust that the Government of  the United States of America would be able to arrangefor the  suspension of all  War Debt payments until the  deliberations of  theConference were concluded.February 10, 1933.
