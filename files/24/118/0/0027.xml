This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.SECBET,CP. 2426.THE CABINET.RESTRICTION OP GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS TO FIRMSON THE KING&apos;S ROLL.MEMOKAN DUM BY THE SECBETABY OF STATE FOB WAB.With reference to the memorandum on this subject by the Minister of Labour_3(CP. 2265), I circulate a note by the Surveyor-General of Supply. 6en25w. s. c.The War Office,Uh January, 1921.I have every sympathy with the desire of the Minister of Labour that all employers should be induced to take their share in discharging the national obligation of providing employment for disabled ex-service men. There are, however, certain practical difficulties in the way of his proposal to restrict Government contracts to firms on the King&apos;sBoLIn particular, the proposal would unduly restrict the field of Government contracts and the area of competition ; there are certain industries, trades and services which are quite unsuitable for the employment of disabled men, whilst some supplies must be obtained from abroad and the proposal could not be applied in such cases. There are, moreover, whole industries which have not accepted the King&apos;s Boll scheme, and upon which the War Office are dependent for supplies. It is very doubtful whether the threat to withhold future Government contracts from such firms would cause them to modify their attitude.I think it should be an instruction to Government Contracts Departments that they should as far as may be reasonably practicable endeavour to place contracts with firms on the Kings Boll, but I do not think that the instruction should go beyond this.J. Stevenson.(B21/54)   100  1/21   HAS, Ltd.  8888wo
