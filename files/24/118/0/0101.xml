Later a crowd of about 3,000 assembled ou road between Munshiganj and Rai &apos; Bareli, addressed by Deputy Commissioner and others, and persuaded to go back along road. On reaching other side of bridge, numbers largely augmented by fresh crowds,^and crowd numbering between 7,000 to 10,000 men become unmanageable. Refused to retire, and police and officers subjected to volleys of stones and kankar, attacks also made with lathies. Became necessary to use fire-arms. Had firing not been resorted to, large mob would have entered city with disastrous results. Crowds included number of pesis and other criminal characters. Independent newspaper Allahabad has attempted to make capital out of occurrences at Pai Bareli, describing them as Rai Bareli tragedy.   A full report is expected from the United Provinces.Section 3.-The Commissioners, Lncknow and Fyzabad, have been ordered to make proposals for dealing with local difficulties, and a special officer lias been put on duty under Board of Revenue to work at proposals for revision of Oudli Rent Act.Section 4.

Full report promised by Local Government.Section 5. Punjab. Lull in political agitation continues, but rural classes being gradually inoculated and Panchayats being established in many places to dispose of petty cases without resort to courts. Sikh political activities give some cause for anxiety.   Kirpau question becoming serious.Section 0. No unseemly demonstrations to disturb harmony provincial Durbar and inauguration new councils on Stli. Ceremonies most successful. Selection Ministers well received, and of late less talk of rendering reforms nugatory.

movement extended to Orissa, formerly unaffected, Utkal (Jnion Conference adopted non-co-operation, but this reported to be due to preponderance of Singlibhuin dele-gates and decision may be challenged. Bihar and Orissa students also adopted non-co-operation, and noisy demonstration by students at Cuttack, at meeting to congratulate. Lord Sinha and Madliusunan Das on their appointments. Bihar Students&apos;Conference (delegates attending, 157) resolved (1) Association should deal with political matters affecting students&apos; community provided that only students over 10 years of age participate; (2) should call on. students of Bihar and Orissa above 16 to withdraw immediately from Government schools; (3) delegates should take steps next clay to withdraw from such institutions. Interview with, delegates only actually agreed to, and unlikely many students will withdraw.Section 8. Assam. Assam association in recent conference defined object as attainment Swaraj by all legitimate means, but no resolution about non-co-operation, and President, Avhile supporting movement generally, did net advocate a withdrawal boys from schools. One person elected to Local Council announced intention resigning seat, but has not yet done so.Section 9. Central Provinces. Intensive propaganda prior to, during and after Congress has familiarised masses in towns and some large]- villages with idea of non-co-operation, and political situation deteriorating. Mohamedans aroused to consider-able state of excitement. A few incidents of defiant attitude towards authority of Government servants. Wave of excitement passing through schools and colleges, but position has not turned out as badly as anticipated. Number of students who have left small, but numerous waverers, and attendance at some institutions poor. Every effort being made to counteract non-co-operation propaganda by heads of various institutions, and improvement hoped lor if students not continuously subjected to mischievous influence. Three national schools established. With the departure of Gandhi and the Ali brothers the Maliratta Brahmins, under the leadership of Dr. Munje, are raising their heads, and said to be contemplating counter movement against educational boycott. Apart from educational unrest and suspension of practice by six lawyers, manifestations of non-co-operation not so far very serious; only one resignation of elected Member of Council. Social boycott, however, though repudiated by Gandhi, encouraged by Ali brothers, being practised, facilities for burial being-refused elected Mohamedan member of Local Council who recently died. This is Clearly (? word omitted) anxiety about situation.Section 10.- Delhi. Week comparatively quiet. Congress Committee advertised in Press plans for marring success Duke&apos;s visit, namely, Hartal on day of inauguration Council State and Legislative Assembly, and on evening of fireworks at fort.Section 11. Understood that merchants and shopkeepers resent interference, and desire to witness tamasha likely to prevail, as proclamation parade, 1st January, witnessed by large appreciative crowd. Local national court (? handed) over to * Congress Committee. Institutions of. suits in ordinary, law courts not so far affected. In business outlook no improvement. Congress Resolution justifying repudiation of contracts owing to depreciation of rupee accepted at meeting of piece goods merchants.Burma. University and school boycott main political feature. Senate made considerable concession in regard to university regulations and Local Government has agreed to conference for discussing measures connected with improvement of Anglo-vernacular education. Concessions had no effect. 5,000 students and schoolboys engage in boycott, national schools to be established in Rangoon and elsewhere. Indications of Burma Extremists endeavouring to get into closer touch with Indian Extremists.   Social boycott of Moderates may also be tried.Bombay. Mahratta National School at last opened with about a dozen scholars. Gandhi informed deputation of non-co-operating students that their rule in political scheme&quot; would receive special attention at Provincial Conference at Ahmedabad. One-rupee, five-rupee, and ten-rupee Khilafat receipts are believed to be ready for issue. Congress resolution being explained at public meetings, but only one meeting of any importance. Umballa Trades Association, as protest against depreciation in exchange, decided to order no more goods from abroad until August next, and to refuse to pay for goods ordered and received till rupee is again 2s.Section .12. Associations of depressed classes Bombay have written to Wedgwood and Spoor complaining of social ostracism to which untouchables subjected, and pointing out that non-co-operation movement openly aiming at
odestruction of constituted authority, and withdrawal of: British augurs ill for these classes.Section. 13. General. As result of renewed activities of non-co-operation after Nagpur Congress, situation has undoubtedly worsened in many parts of the country. Most dangerous manifestations of movement are attempts to get at rural masses, as in United Provinces ; and some reason to apprehend that efforts will also be made to capture labour organisations, with view to bring about extensive strikes at favourable moment. At the same time, sporadic disturbances more likely than co-ordinated and simultaneous movement, and that lack of funds is hampering non-co-operationers is indicated by appeals of Gandhi for self-denial by people. We are about to address Local Governments on whole question, but are not at present disposed to think that radical change in policy hitherto pursued will be necessary, though developments may occur at any moment which would necessitate this.
