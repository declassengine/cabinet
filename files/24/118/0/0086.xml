This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.SECRET. 9CP. 2484THE CABINET.RUSSIAN REFUGEES AT BASRAH.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I desire to invite the attention of my colleagues to the following note regarding     121 the support from Army votes of Russian refugees at Basrah.   I am strongly of opinion Transport that the War Office should no longer be responsible for this expenditure, and I cannot    1779 undertake to find room for charges of this sort, which have no connection with Army affairs, within the reduced total that will be available for the War Office in the coming financial year.W. S. C.The War Office,25th January, 1921.There are 545 Russian subjects (including women and children) interned at Basrah. They came to Enzeli in April this year to escape the Bolsheviks and were interned by us.These refugees are being supported by the British Government, and, in accordance with a Treasury ruling, the charge falls upon Army Votes. It is reported that the present monthly cost is 4,300/., and that up to date some 33,000/. has been spent.On 3rd September the Foreign Office suggested that the Crimea appeared to be the only spot to which these refugees could be sent, and with this suggestion the War Office agreed. In view of General Wrangel&apos;s collapse, however, the War Office on 2nd December asked the Foreign Office to try to arrange some other destination for these refugees, and suggested Serbia. To this suggestion the Foreign Office have now replied that they do not feel justified in approaching the Serbian Government, and they are unable to suggest any other destination.The commitment of the War Office, accordingly, in respect of these Russian refugees, appears as if it may be indefinitely prolonged unless these charges can be transferred to the suggested new department for the Middle East. In any case, as the ultimate disposal of these refugees will necessarily depend on diplomatic arrangements, the War Office should not be burdened with a financial commitment during the interim period which they can do nothing to shorten or terminate.(Bi&apos;l/55)   100  1/21   HAS, Ltd.   8860wo
