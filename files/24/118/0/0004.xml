(P 3&apos;5) Frowi Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 770931,December 1920.(Received 6 pan.)Clear the line.1502 S. Afghanistan. Your telegram of 19th December, 41.52. . Your general attitude towards possible concessions coincides with our own. It was, of course, never contemplated that Dobbs should initiate discussion of any concessions whatever. We were simply facing fact that it will be impossible to avoid at Kabul questions on which Afghans showed insistence at Mussoorie. Dobbs may be relied upon to bargain throughout as best he can, and to make all possible capital out of concessions reluctantly wrung from us.We understand you to give us latitude to deal with Torkham accordingly.We should be glad of similar latitude as regards Afghan envoy in London. Afghans are so set (? on this omitted) that it will not, we hope, be difficult to attach to it as conditions: -(I) right to maintain British envoy at Kabul; (2) restriction of Afghan envoy in London to dealings with India Office in view of lndia&apos;s special relations with Afghanistan ; and (3) maintenance of direct dealings between Viceroy and Amir on most matters. We agree that (2) can hardly be expected to remain final -arrangement.Dobbs has been instructed to bear your concluding remarks in mind. But course of recent Afghan politics renders it almost inconceivable that present Afghan G-overn-* ment will invite or submit to formal restoration of British control of their foreign relations under guise of a regular defensive alliance with Great Britain with&apos; clear-cut definition of our vast military obligation for defence of Afghanistan.Ignorance of public opinion in England as to immensely important strategical and political position of Afghanistan in present circumstances of Asia is unfortunate, but should hardly be permitted to deflect our policy. We suggest remedy for uiipreparedness of public opinion to recognise the importance of securing friendly relations with Afghanistan lies in adequate instruction of that opinion anterior to, and .at time of publication of treaty, if treaty is secured.
