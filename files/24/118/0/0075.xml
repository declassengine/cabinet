cs,y&amp; Jcy^JL^rJt 373. THIS DOCU 1MT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS britannic i/IAJFSTY1 S government^^WT -FUSIHESS PREMISES AND THE geddrs.-IT RESTRICTION ACT. FFIxORArIDU.1 RY TITE AJ MI STIR OFJIJWVL Ttt.L.fi.58.The Report of the Select Committee on Business OPremises is a very unsatisfactory document.        They were appointed, &quot;to inquire into the Position of Leaseholders &quot;and Tenants of Business premises and to advise v/hether &quot;any and, if so, what alterations in the Law are required to &quot;remove obstacles to the development of their businesses &quot;arising out of conditions affecting tenure, undue restrictions &quot;on improvements, and unreasonable increases in rents&quot;, and.  . I think that the intention of the Government in moving for the appointment of the Select Committee was to obtain a Report which might form the basis of permanent legislation in regard to the relations of Landlords and Tenants.   Instead of this, the Select Committee have recommended a scheme of a temporary character to expire at the same time as the Increase of Rent Act, 1920, and have suggested that in the meantime a small committee of experts should be appointed to consider the whole state of the present law with a view to permanent legislation.Section 13 of the Rent Restriction Act 1920 which makes that Act applicable to Business Premises will expire in England and Wales on the 24th of June of this year, and in Scotland on the 28th of May. The following questions arise (1) Are the Government to adopt the temporary scheme suggested by the Select Committee and to introduce legislation to give effect to it, or if not, what (if any) action is to be taken in view of the early expiry of section 13 of the Rent Restriction -ct?
374(2 i Assuming that legislation is inevitable, whichMinister and v/hich Departnont is to be responsible for it?(3) What, if any, action is to be taken in regard tothe suggested appointment of a conn ittee of experts?With &quot;regard to the first of these questions -(a) The Select Committee reported that they were &quot;strongly of opinion that legislation   on the &quot;lines suggested should be passed with the &quot;least possible delay, so as to ensure that there &quot;will be no hiatus clue to the lapse of the In-&quot;crease of Rent, etc., Act, 1920, as it affects &quot;business premises; and. they would draw attention &quot;to tho fact that the provisions of the Act expire &quot;one month earlier in Scotland than in the rest &quot;of the United Kingdom&quot;.(b) If any action is to be taken, the simplest plan might be merely to continue section 13 until June 1923 when the rest of the Rent Restriction Act expires, but this proposal would certainly excite hostility. in both Houses of Parliament, and it would be contrary to the recommendation of the Select Committee (see paragraphs -6 - 13 of their Report) .(c) The only practicable alternatives seem to be&apos;.either(i) to adopt the Committee&apos;s recommendation, or(ii) to submit proposals of a more permanent character.As to Ministerial responsibility for legislation affecting Business Premises, it is quite clear that whatever Department
375I is to be responsible it should not be the Ministry of Healthwhich has no concern with such matters and possesses no expertise on the subject.   Probably the Bill should be entrusted to the Law Officers. (3) For similar reasons the Minister of Health cannot beresponsible for advising as to the appointment of, or for appointing the suggested committee of experts.I have brought this question to the notice of the Cabinet in view of its urgency and. of the risk of its being overlooked, not because I admit any Departmental responsibility in regard to it.C.

377REPORT.The Select Committee appointed to inquire into the Position of Leaseholders and Tenants of Business Premises and to advise whether any and, if so, what alterations in the Law are required to remove obstacles to the development of their businesses arising out of conditions effecting tenure, undue restrictions on improvements, and unreasonable increases in rents; have agreed to the following Report: 1. Your Committee were appointed on 22nd June last and have since then hold 21 sittings and examined 32 witnesses.2. Your Committee decided at the outset, that, in view of tho wide scope of their inquiry, it would bo impossible for them, except in very exceptional cases, to take evidence on the details of individual cases, whether of landlord or tenant, and thai it would be necessary for them to confine themselves to representative witnesses who could speak for considerable bodies. Evidence has accordingly been taken from representatives of Various associations of tenants of business premises in England, Scotland and Ireland, and from various associations who may bo taken to represent tho interests of the owners of property. Some evidence has also been taken of an official character, and some from persons who have to deal with business premises, on behalf both of owner and of tenants.3. In addition to tho evidence which has been hoard by your Committee, a large number of letters have been addressed to them by individuals and business firms. Your Committee, for tho reason given above, have boon unable to scrutinise these in detail.&apos;It is not possible to form a sound judgment on any individual case, unless all the circumstances arc known. A demand for an increase in rent, which may appear prima facie harsh and unconscionable, may be found reasonable when the date of the original lease is known, or when the present conditions of the locality are investigated. And, equally, a claim of a tenant, which may seem at first sight frivolous or unreasonable, may be justified by the particular circumstances of his business or of the district in which it is situated.4. Your Committee are satisfied upon the evidence that,(i) in a substantial number of cases, tenants have been compelled to submit to what appears to be an unconscionable increase in rent in order to retain possession of their business premises; and(ii) in a number of cases they have been dispossessed of business premises without being given any option to retain them on fair terms.5. In both types of cases tho landlords have taken full advantage of the present abnormal demand for business premises; and in the second type of case their action has sometimes caused peculiar hardship, owing to a consequent loss of goodwill. It is also conceivable that an entire cessation of business might result from tho possible non-oxistence of alternative accommo-dation in the business area. On the other hand, the great majority of landlords do not appear to have acted harshly towards tenants. The grievances above referred to are confined to comparatively small districts, mainly, in fact to the central quarters of large towns; and in many instances property owners are doing little more than recoup themselves for previous lean years. On the whole, owners of business premises cannot be said to exact an excessive return on tho capital invested by them in such property, These considerations ought to be borne in mind in deciding the nature of the legislation to be recommended, although your Committee believe that at present the grievances of business tenants are too general and too often combined with loss and displacement of business to exclude all idea of Government action.The Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1920.6. This Act, as applied to exclusively business premises, was intended to afford temporary protection, ponding more considered legislation, to the smaller businesses, whose existence might bo threatened during the ensuing twelve months.7. In many cases it has no doubt fulfilled its object, but its operation so far as business premises are concerned has not been wholly satisfactory. The amount of rent paid, in the case of a dwelling-house, may be taken as a rough and ready measure of the financial position of an individual, but it is often a misleading standard in respect of business premises. The rent paid for a City office affords no measure of tho need for protection of tho firm occupying the office, nor of the value ot the Q. 3628. business transacted in it; and a multiple-shop firm occupying a small branch in a suburb is in a Q- 4229. very different position from the small shopkeeper who may have sunk all his resources in the shop next door.8. The Act has not been long enough in operation for any judgment to be formed on the cases q 42c)o f that have come before the courts, but from the letters received and the evidence before the Committee, it would appear that in many directions it has produced unexpected effects and sometimes led to injustice.  In some cases, it seems, mon of small means, exrsoldiers and others,0.206-(a).
ivREPORT FROM the whole invested their resources in acquiring promises of which they cannot now get possession1 Q. 2838. in others, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5 of tho Act, important schemes of reconstruction are stated to havo been held up because possession could not bo obtained of small parts of the premises involved. Again, where a property is subdivided, the tenant of the wholo may be outside the protection of the Act, and his rent may bo raised to any extent, while his sub-tenants are protected by the Act, Lcttings at inclusive rents under leases have brought upon landlords very heavy additional burdens in the abnormal increase of local rates and other outgoings which under the Acts cannot be recovered until tho tenancies have terminated.i). Further, as has been pointed out by numerous witnesses, there is no adequate reason, cither in logic or equity, why a business tenant paying  x in rent should receive special protection, while one paying J&amp;e + l is unprotected. And, moreover, in many cases, especially in tho provinces, the lessor of a property may be, so far as his financial resources are concerned, in more need of protection than his tenant.10. An anomaly arises from the fact that promises used partly for business purposes, and partly as a dwelling-house, come under the provisions applicable to dwelling-houses, and not under those applicable to business premises, although in many cases the use of the premises for dwelling-house purposes maybe merely incidental to their use as business premises.Noibury. n- Cases of peculiar tenancies have been brought to the attention of the Committee arisingout of the circumstances of individual trades, such as that of the Master Packers&apos; Association of Manchester, where rent alone is not tho true measure of the return which a landlord may fairly expect to receive from his tenant, and where protection based merely on rental value may be found to operate unfairly.12. Tho adoption of a percentage scale, whether suitable or not in the case of small residential houses, which aro usually lot on short tenancies, could only load to more serious anomalies in the cases of valuable business premises, frequently lot on long leases, whore the old rents often bear no proportion to the rental value.13. For these and other reasons your Committee, while realising that the main object of the Increase of Kent, &amp;c, Act, viz., the protection of tenants from dispossession and excessive rents, has been satisfactorily attained, are convinced that a mere extension or amendment of that Act will not solve the difficulties that have been brought to their notice, and they do not recommend that the operation of the Act in relation to exclusively business promises should bo prolonged.-General Effect of Evidence.tecBoyton 14. Witnesses of great experience in dealing with property have impressed upon the CommitsLang. the importance of avoiding any provisions which may discourage the investment of capital in theHunt.        erection and reconstruction of premises.   Tho character of the problem varies in different towns and districts.   In the City of London it appears to bo generally agreed that, while there is at present Q. G74seq.   great pressure on the existing accommodation, and very high competitive rents are being offered, Q. 2975,      such a condition is not likely to be permanent, and that sufficient additional accommodation will, in course of time, become available by the erection of now buildings on sites not now fully utilised, and by the tendency of some classes of businesses to seek accommodation in less central areas where Q. 3G03      premises can be obtained at lower rentals.   The actual ground in the City is of course now almost completely occupied; and your Committee are satisfied that future needs can only bo met within that area by schemes of rebuilding and reconstruction, involving largo capital expenditure.   In the Q. 1112.      central areas of the great provincial towns, the problem and its solution aro probably the same as in the City, but in the&apos; small provincial towns and in suburban districts, whether metropolitan or provincial, the need for additional accommodation, especially for shops, can only be met by ordinary building development.   In the majority of cases the ordinary small trader does not want to invest his capital in land and buildings, but prefers w rent his premises, and to use his capital in his business. The accommodation, therefore, must be provided by someone else, either the developing owner or the builder, who naturally looks for a reasonable return on his capital and a reasonable security for it.15. It is, perhaps, imperfectly realised by the public at large to what an extent building Q. 3582 seq. operations of all kinds are dependent upon borrowed money, and how many buildings aro hold as security for the money that has been advanced for their construction and equipment.Q. 2852-3 1 6. Any proposed legislation, therefore, which tends to discourage the bond fide investor is toq! 3606. be approached with caution; and more especially at the present time, when there aro large arrears Q. 4347 seq  0f building to be made up and other forms of investment offer many competitive attractions.q 834 174 The evidence before your Committee of those who claim to speak for the tenants has been ofq! 1092. two distinct tendencies,   Some witnesses (especially those dealing with conditions in the City ofQ. 1286. London) have urged that the main need is for some temporary protection until conditions shall have?gg, had time to settle down.  Other witnesses, on the contrary, state that they attach little or no value1895*. to temporary provisions, but desire a permanent alteration of the law.Conclusions.18. In deciding as to whether legislation should be of a temporary or permanent character, and as to what precise form it should take, Your Committee consider that as a general principle a Q 3491      minimum, of State restriction is to be desired.   There is no question that building operations have
SELECT COMMITTEE ON BUSINESS PREMISES.Vbeen deterred by the Rent Restriction Acts, and such must bo tho effect of every measure which Q, 2838. operates to deprive an owner of reaping the full economic benefits accruing from his property.     Q- &apos;1290-19. The cause of the present discontent is to some extent tho dasiro of speculators to exploit the present abnormal value of property, but fundamentally, it is simply the prevailing excess of Q. 188G.demand over supply.   It has been stated in evidence that relatively few business premises were Q- 414G-constructed between 1910 and 1914, and an insufficient number have been built since 1914, while q, 3533. the demand, which languished during the War, grew rapidly after tho Armistice.20. Consequently the true remedy for existing grievances lies in increasing supply (a) by building now business premises on any available sites in business areas;(b) by reconstruction on larger lines, providing increased accommodation ;(e) by developing new sites upon areas adjacent to business districts but now occupied by decayed or undeveloped semi-residential areas.21. These processes would inevitably restore the balance between demand and supply, and arc essential to the future well-being of tho country.   The real problem is how to meet the present difficulties without deterring builders and owners from embarking on tho tasks of building and reconstruction, and without deterring capitalists from financing such operations.   It is clear that f: there will be no builders and no mortgagees if the State places too drastic restrictions upon tho &apos; rights of owners to claim economic rents and to dispossess tenants upon the expiration of their tenancies.   This is to-day the cardinal objection to giving large statutory rights of compensation ; for disturbance or improvements, and to establishing tenants&apos; fixity of tenure.&apos; 22. For these reasons your Committee are of opinion that their recommendations hereafter &apos; set forth are well grounded, inasmuch as they give business tenants a considerable measure of relief particularly in respect of having &quot;time to turn round&quot; without destroying all inducements to : landlords and prospective landlords to increase the supply of premises.   If your Committeo&apos;srecommendations are accepted, there will be little danger of tenants being dispossessed without p any chance of finding other accommodation, or of being subjected to extortionate demands for I rent. At the same time landlords will enjoy much more freedom and be more equitably treated 1 than under the provisions of the Increase of Ptent, etc., Act, 1920, which was originally drafted to ; cover dwelling-houses only, and is therefore inevitably unsatisfactory in its application to business ; premises.   Some of the witnesses who gave evidence before the Committee on behalf of property owners have substantially accepted the main principle of the recommendations. (See Questions I and Answers, 3816, 3817, 3818, 3909, 3910, 3911.)23. The scheme suggested below is of a temporary character because(i) the ratio between supply and demand will become in due time more normal;(ii) it would seem desirable that temporary legislation of the kind contemplated should expire at the same time as the Increase of Rent, etc., Act, 1920, so that the law of landlord and tenant can be reviewed as one whole question, instead of being dealt with piecemeal.24. With this revision in view, your Committee suggest that it is expedient to appoint at some date before the expiry of the Increase of Rent, etc., Act, 1920, and of any Statute founded on these recommendations, a small committee of experts to consider the whole question and to go more deeply into its many technical bearings. Your Committee were faced with the alternative either of considering some remedy for the present emergencies, or of entering upon an inquiry into the whole state of the present law. The latter course would have entailed prolonged consideration by experts of the legal complexities bearing upon existing contracts, mortgages, etc., which would be involved in any far-reaching alterations in the permanent law. The conclusion of such an inquiry could not have been reached in time to afford relief to the pressing difficulties revealed in numerous cases.25. The suggested period of two years is not intended to represent a hard and fast time limit. The question should be open to review if no legislation founded on the recommendations of the Committee of experts above referred to has been passed at the termination of that period, and provided that the conditions now prevailing then remain substantially unchanged.Recommendations.26. Your Committee recommend that, within a period of two years and a half, that is until the 24th June, 1923, failing mutual agreement, a tenant be empowered at some reasonable time before the expiration of his tenancy to apply to the Tribunal hereinafter mentioned for the prolongation of his tenancy for a period terminating not later than the expiry of the Increase of Rent, etc, Act, 1920, and the Tribunal shall have jurisdiction to grant such application upon such terms as shall appear just to the Tribunal.The Tribunal in deciding (a) whether to grant the application, and (b) what terms are just, will have regard to all the circumstances of the case, and in particular to (i) the length and character of the tenancy or occupation(ii) the then rental value of the premises in the market;(iii) whether the landlord wishes to terminate the tenancy in order to enter personally into possession;
vi REPORT FROM THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON BUSINESS PREMISES.(iv) the fact of notice to quit having been given in pursuance of any bond fide scheme of reconstruction or development, whether public or private;(v) the date on which the tenant has received his notice to quit;(vi) any improvements made by the tenant which have substantially increased the permanent value of the reversion and which have not been made by him in discharge of any contractual liability, such improvements not to be regarded as a reason for increasing the rent;(vii) any claim by the tenant that the goodwill of his business has added to the letting value of the premises;(viii) the existence or otherwise of alternative accommodation equally suitable in all respects;(ix) whether tho landlord has or has not previously consented or offered to renew the tenancy at a fair rental.27. The Tribunal, upon tho hearing of any such application, to have power, having regard to the same considerations (as an alternative method of relief), save where the property is required by the landlord in order to carry out an improvement scheme desirable in the public interest, to award to an applicant in respect of his not being granted a temporary prolongation of his tenancy as contemplated under the provisions of the preceding paragraph such compensation as shall be considered by them just and reasonable. The compensation will be measured by the increase in the rental value of the premises caused by reason of any matters referred to in the preceding paragraph in respect of the period for which the tenancy might have been extended.28. Your Committee suggest that questions in dispute should where possible be settled by arbitration, failing*which the Tribunal might consist either of the County Court Judge or of one of a panel of arbitrators to be appointed by him after conferring with airy local branches of the Law Society and Surveyors&apos; Institute. Your Committee attach much importance to the keeping of the costs of any dispute as low as possible.29. Contracting-out should be made illegal, and clauses in existing contracts of tenancy which have the effect of depriving a tenant of the benefit or protection of any Act of Parliament founded on your Committee&apos;s recommendations should be rendered inoperative.30. One of the points of reference to your Committee related to the1 question ot undue restrictions on improvements. Having regard to the temporary nature of their recommenda-tiorts, your Committee do not think it necessary to make any suggestions on this subject.31. Your Committee do not propose that their recommendations should apply to premises referred to in Sub-section (2) of Section 13 of the Increase of Rent, etc., Act, 1920.32. The question of premises ined partly for business purposes and partly for dwelling-house purposes, will need careful consideration in view of the provisions of the Increase of Rent, etc., Act, on this point and of legal decisions thereon.33. Your Committee recommend that buildings erected after or in course of erection on the 2nd April, 1919, should be exempted from the operation of any Act founded upon this Report.34. While it is not practicable to re-open cases that have already been disposed ot, your Committee are of opinion that any action taken by lessors or landlords to increase rents or obtain possession of premises after the date of the publication of this Report should be open to revision by the Tribunal.35. Your Committee are strongly of opinion that legislation on the lines suggested should be passed with the least possible delay, so as to ensure that there will he no hiatus due to the iapse of the Increase of Rent, etc., Act, 1920, as it affects business premises; and they would draw attention to the fact that the provisions of the Act expire one month earlier in Scotland than in the rest of the United Kingdom. In the application of these recommendations to Scotland, the 28th May should be substituted for the 24th June, and the Sheriff for the County Court Judge.i-printed under the authority of HIS MAJESTY&apos;S STATIONERY OFFICE By Wyman &amp; Sons, Limited, Fetter Lane, London, E.C. 4.
