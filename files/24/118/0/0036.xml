Unemployment is still increasing in the shipbuilding and engineering industries, and the position in the former is said to be becoming serious in the north of England. Short time and unemployment are still on the increase in Yorkshire in the woollen and worsted industries and the wholesale clothing trade. Further discharges are expected from the iron and steel industries early in 1921. Slackness is reported among transport workers, and no improvement is expected until the spring. In the cotton industry, the adoption of short time on a large scale has prevented unemployment becoming so serious as was at one time anticipated. The^e
I d U3 &apos;   ;is no change to report in the boot and shoe trade.  Unemployment is increasing in the Welsh tinplate industry, and a considerable number of workpeople are on short f ) time.II.
