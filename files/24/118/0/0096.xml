JBLI5 DCOUKKlCT 13 the gHOggggY Qi&apos;&apos; HIS BRITAMIO MAJESTY^ QOYIilRBMT..Rates of Wages on Road Work etc.. provided far the unemployed.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.PET,1.   When the Arterial Road Soheme for providing work for the unemployed was being considered,the question of the rates of wages to be paid oame up and it was originally decided that during a probationary period the rates should be 75^ of the normal rates. This deoision was subsequently revoked.As a condition of grants for Arterial Roads Looal Authorities-have until quite recently been required to insert tho pair Wages Glauses in any contract entered into in oonneotion with the grant, and similarly local authorities asking the Ministry of Transport what wages they should pay themselves havo been told that they should observe the Fair Wtgos Clauses.   I had understood that within tho lest few days the Ministry of Transport have omitted the condition as to the pair Wages Clauses in the oaso of now grants, and have adopted the policy of informing enquirers that the matter is one for settlement between employers and employed, but tho attached letter from the joint committee of Civil Engineering and public Works Contractors auggesta that&quot;in-struotions&quot;aro being given.2.   In addition to the arterial road soheme special State assistanoo towards the provision of worli for the unemployed i3 given through the Unomploymont Grants Committee, xnresidod over by Lord St. Davids, whioh har a sum of  fc,0O0.O0O at its disposal and may make grants to Local Authorities up to 60$ of tho wages bill.   The committee lays down no conditions as to the rates of wages to oo&apos; paid.3.   It is difficult to arrive at an;/ decision as to the appro-oriate rate.   In oertain districts and towns the rates paid oy local authorities or public contractors carrying out worl: on roads approximate to the looal rates for labourers in the Building Crade, v/hich are at present unduly inflated; in other oases thy rate is 2d per hour below.  ..........    y-:yrr-r?tmwxmi
the Building *&apos;rad.e rate, while many districts ado,)t the principle of paying to the men en road work the rufces paid to the ordinary employees of tho Authority.Bo far aa is known no authority (except in the oase below) has yet fixed for work on arterial roads or other work specially provided lor tho unemployed a &quot;reliof works&quot; rate lower than the rate paid to their own road men, though in a number of oases the weekly earnings of the men employed havo been reduced by a system of short-time working, instituted to spread the work over as many men as possible,The ratos paid on theso works will be closely scrutinised, and the possibility of Ion.? oontinuod relief involves serious financial considernation.    The question, however, whether tho full rate ought to be paid has recently been raised in -two ways;-(a) By a letter from for. A.J. Hobson, president of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce, of whioh a oopy is attached, ihis letter suggests that a maintenance wage only should be paid, and that only pt:rt of this should be paid in cash.(b) By a letter from the joint Committee of Civil Engineering and publje porks Contractors suggesting that the rates of wages on these works should be at least S3^c)v lese than the reoognised rates for the same olass of work.(c) JBy the action of the Kent County Council in fixing the wages to be paid to mon employed on air.arterial road in Dartford at a figure (l/2d) e^ual to the hourly rate of their permanent road men; this hourly rate is of oourso loss than that whioh would have to be paid by a con-tractor on similar work to mon liable to lose time through wet weather and is substantially lose than the rate (1/lld) oleimed as tho trade union rate for the work.I  think that   the Government should not take   the initiative in determining the rate of wages,   nor-should they gi/e instructions, one way or the other, but should   leave it entirely   to the   Local  Authority to take  the course  whioh/it
520it thinks best in the oiroumstanoes.   The Government grant would not therefore be in any way conditional on the payment of any partioular rate of wages.   I think also that everything possible would be done to encourage arrangements for short-time working on relief works.  This would not only spread the work over a larger number of men, but would also oounteraot the danger of relatively high weekly earnings on &quot;relief work&quot; aa oompared with ordinary work.6.  A speoial question arises with regard to the rights of an unemployed man in receipt of out-of-work donation or unemployment benefit if he declines to undertake work on artorial roads etc.   Tho rule laid down in the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, with regard to unemployment benefit is that a man is not disqualified for senefit &quot;by reason only that he has declined -(b) an offer of employment in the district where ho was last ordinarily employed at a rate of wage lower, or on conditions less favourable, than those whioh he habitually obtained in hla usual employment in that district, or would,have obtained had he continued to be so employed; or(o) an offer of employment in any other distriot at a rate of wage lower, or on conditions! less favourable, than those generally observed in that district by agreement between assoolations of employers and of -   employees, or, falling any suoh agreement, than those generally recognised in that district by good employers&quot;. This rile, whioh is statutory as regards unemployment benefit, has been applied administratively under the Out-*of-Work Donation Scheme.The substantial offoot of this rule would be that if a specially low rate were fixed for arterial roads, etc, and this
work wore declined for this reason by one of the unemployed, ha would nevertheless bo entitled to romain on donation or benefit.   This would necessarily be so as regards benefit where the rule is statutory and, in praotioe, the rule oould not be altered for donation.   Any question of doubt as to whether tho rate iB or is not too low would be tested by an appeal to a Oourt of Referees, with a further appeal, if neoessary, to the Umpire.6,   I should add that the task of seleoting men for work on arterial roads eto., has been placed in the hands of the Looal Employment Committees attaohed to the Employment Exchanges, whioh consist largely of Trade union members.   Protests will oertainly be received from a number of those Committees if the rates of wages are in fact fixed below what the Trade Union regards as the standard rates, and probably some of the Committees will deolino to have anything to do with the selection cf the men in such circumstance.0., and might even resign altogether.    Tnis would be unfortunate but I do not think it oan bo helped.?.   The rates paid on these schemes are bound to re-act upon the rates whioh the Government might be oalled upon to pay if a policy of oentral relief became necessary, and for these reasons I have thought it desirable to bring the matter before the Cabinet. 1 should like a decision as to the polioy to bo adopted and as to the replies to be sent to the Aseooiated Chambers of Commerce and the Civil Tingineering and public works Contractors.(Signed) T,J.

522COPY,14. Queen Aune*s Gate.Westminster, S.W.1.5th January, 1921.Rt.Hoo. T. J. Man samara, HJ)., M.P.,Minister of Labour,Montagu House, Whitehall, S.W.1.Sir,With reference to the Relief Works whioh are now &quot;being started in varj.ous parts of the courtry and more ospeoially in respect to the Grants that are &quot;being ms.de in aid of Read Con-reconstruotion, I shall be glad to be informed on the following points:It has oome to my notice as Chairman of the Finance Committee of the City of Sheffield that a Grant Of  60,000 has been&apos;*made for the making of a road in that City to provide work for the unemployed.   Apparently this Grant is not accompanied by any directions as to the rate of wages which it Is thought wise that we should pay.   The Town Clerk takes the view that it would be the wish of the Government that Trade Union rates of wages should be paid and oonsiders that the lowest rate for unskilled labour is ls.6d. per hour and that those employed on Relief Works might properly be given a 40-hours week which would result in a weekly wage of.  3 per man,I would draw your attention to the fact that this rate of remuneration is for a short week&apos;s work only and that the men would probably regard this work as a mere qualifying oondition for the receipt of money, and we could not therefore expect from them much more than a somewhat slaok perfoimanoe of work.If this view as to the wages we are expected to pay is correct, I should like to point out to you that this wage will be regarded by all the Trade Unions as the fixing of a Standard Minimum Wage and all other workers will be regarded as superior in character to the lewsst grade of unskilled labour and will expect higher remuneration proportionately.I anticipate a fall in the cost of living whioh will be progressive and, I think, fairly rapid during the next few months and such a fixed wage will therefore become automatically more attractive as time goes on and will, I think, have t.fc.3 affect of gathering the unemployed from other districts where Rcliaf Works have not been started, and thereby aggravate the over-crowding in large cities, whioh is already a grave evil.It also seems to me that for Relief &quot;forks a mainten-ance wage should be given of which only a part should be in cash and the remainder in credits for food and for simple articles of clothing for the wives and children of men having dependents.
mMinister of Labour. 2 5. 1. 1921.l*y view and that of my Couooil is that the Trade depression will be seveitj and of long continuance aad it is therefore desirable that oare and forethought should be exercised in the planning of relief wages and that provision should be made for the rate of wages to be adjusted from time to time in accord-aooe with the oost of living.I shall be glad to know if this Association can be of any assistance to you in making suggestions for the organis-ation of the distribution of relief.&quot;I shall be extremely obliged if I can have an answer to this letter before Thursday next, the 13th instant, when there is a Quarterly Meeting of this Association at whioh any necessary arrangements could be made.I have the honour to be, Sir, lour obedient Servant,(Signed) Albert J. Hohson.President.P.3. I am venturing to send a oopy of this letter to Sir Robert Home as the whole Industrial question would appear to be involved and thus brings the matter within his sphere of action.
524COPY.JOIN? COMhlTT^ OF CIVIL &amp; PUBLIC WORKS CONTRACTORS.40, Broadway,Westminster, S*W.l.  7th January, 1921.The Minister of Labour, The Minister of Health. (Che iiinieter of Transport.Dear Sirs,Rates on Relief Works.My Committee have had under their serious consideration the effect of the employment of large bodies of men on works of construction for the purpose of giving relief of unemployment, with special regard to the rates of pay and conditions applicable to suoh work, and I am instructed to inform you that in their opinion a clear distinction in tho rates paid to men employed upon relief work and those employed on ordinary constructional work should be made.It was reported by the representative of the Corporation of Walsall at a meeting of Contractors and representatives of Local Authorities held in Birmingham on the 25th inst., under the auspices of this Committee, that the Ministry of Transport had givon instructions-tlDns to his Corporation that on the Road relief work just undertaken by his Council, the men should be paid the full Trade Union rates. The Local Authorities present at the meeting oxpressed the opinion that it was most undesirable that men employed upon relief work should be paid any higher rates than those whioh were applicable to the lowest paid class of labour in the district, and, in the view of my Committee, the rates on Relief work should be at least l&amp;jZfo less than the reoognisod rates of wages for tho same olass of work when oarried out under contract, which was the practice of some Local Authorities previous to the war when executing work for reliof cf unemployment.The effect of paying the samo, or approximately the same, wage on reliof work as on contract work is, in the opinion of my Committee, against all sound economic principles as, generally speaking, the olasB of man employed may be wholly unable to efficiently oarry out the work required of him and for this reason the wages paid should be for the purpose only of preventing distress,  moreover, equal wages on both classes of work may very likely have the offoot of attracting men employed on contract work on to relief work, whore tho skill and energy required is not so great.Yours faithfully,(Signed) S,J, Rimmer,Secretary.
