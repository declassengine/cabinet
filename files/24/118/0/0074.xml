MEMORANDUM ON THE EXECUTION BY GERMANY OF THE MILITARY ARTICLES OF THE PEACE TREATY OF VERSAILLES.I. The vital Military Articles of the Treaty.The military articles of the Treaty were framed to provide exhaustively both for the immediate disarmament of Germany and for the limitation of the strength and power of expansion of the German Army in the future.The vital basis for ensuring the removal of any actual German military menace for a considerable period can, however, be summarized briefly as follows: (a.) The surrender and destruction of all war material in Germany in excess ofthe quantity allowed by the Treaty, (b.) The abolition of the laws constituting universal military service in Germany,and the establishment of a system of voluntary enlistment for thejutureGerman Army.(c.) The reduction of the German armed forces to the establishments laid down in the Treaty.In addition, the decisions of the Boulogne and Spa Conferences (June and July, 1920) provided for : .(1.) The disarmament of the civil population in Germany.(2.) The dissolution of all unauthorized military forces in Germany.(3.) The reduction in the armament of the German police and the demilitarizationof the police forces. (4.) The prohibition of the export of war material.These decisions were generally covered by the various clauses of the Treaty, but their importance has greatly increased since the Treaty was framed.The progress made by the German Governmenc in the execution of the vital military articles of the Treaty is shown in Part II. below.A note on the execution of each separate military article of the Treaty is given in Appendix A.II. Progress in the execution of the vital Military Articles ofthe Treaty.(a.) The surrender and destruction of War Material in Germany in excess of the quantities allowed by the Treaty (Articles 168, 169, 170).1. General. At the outset, considerable difficulties were experienced by the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control in effecting the surrender and destruction of war material, owing to the obstructive attitude of many of the officers and minor officials; the disorder resulting from the Kapp &quot;Putsch&quot; in March, 1920, caused further delay, the work of the Commission being, in fact, entirely stopped for several weeks.Subsequent to the Spa Conference, and with an increase in the technical means of destruction, very great progress has been made in the work of the Commission.(1.) The most important factor in making impossible any fresh aggression by Germany has been the destruction of the very large number of guns existing at the time when Control first commenced. Up to the present, 30,532 guns have been surrendered, of which 28,587 have been destroyed. In addition, 6,000 guns in various stages of construction have been destroyed at Krupps and other factories. Only 1,945 guns remain to be destroyed, of those which have been surrendered; at the present rate of destruction (average 450 each fortnight) these will all have been destroyed by the 15th March.

(a) 2 above, are considered satisfactory.In general, little progress has, however, been made in the surrender of arms by the Einwohnerwehren throughout Germany.The question of the disarmament of, the Einwohnerwehr is fully discussed below under sub-heading II (c).(8877) &apos; . A in addition, there are possibly about 700 guns remaining to be surrendered by the lieichsheer, and from the armament of the fortresses of Kdnigsberg, Kiistrin and Boyen. The question of the armament of these fortresses is still under discussion with the German Government.The surrender and destruction of guns can lie considered most satisfactory.(2.) The totals surrendered in Minenwerfer (10,230), loaded shell (32,807,736 rounds and 33,154 tons) and small-arm ammunition (409,290,500 rounds), and the progress in destruction of this material, are quite satisfactory.(3.) The number of machine guns surrendered (64,149) is less satisfactory, and a large number of machine guns must still be in the hands of unauthorized forces and of the civil population; 9,133, however, are reported to have been either handed into the German Government or seized by the German police, since the institution of the special measures for the disarmament of the civil population. In addition 8,404 machine guns have been notified to the German Government by the various unauthorized forces and by factories.The destruction o  surrendered machine guns (53,224) is satisfactory. (4.) The number of rifles surrendered (2,790,116) is still far below what it should be.v In their Note of 2nd January the German Government stated, however, that up to 30th November, 1920, 1,373,730 rifles, carbines and pistols had either been surrendered by the civil population, or seized by the German police, since the law passed in August, 1920, for the disarmament of the civil population. These arms had been rendered useless, and were being broken up.In addition, 801,653 small arms had been notified to the German Government by the various unauthorized forces [Einwohnerwehr, Selbstschutz, &amp;c.) and by factories.    &apos;This question is fully dealt with below, in its relation to the disarmament of the civil population and of the unauthorized local forces.
4. Disarmament of the Civil Population. In accordance with the Spa Protocol, the German Government, in August, passed a law making it obligatory for the civil population to hand in all arms in their possession. Premiums were paid for all arms handed in by the 21st October, and immunity from punishment for arms held illegally was guaranteed up to the 1st November. Severe penalties were threatened to all, who retained arms in their possession subsequent to the 1st November.The results of the surrender of arms by the civil population and the seizures by the German police are given in sub-paragraphs II. (a) 1 (3) and (4) above.The German Government in its Note of the 2nd January states that all these weapons, with the exception of perhaps 500 rifles, have now been rendered useless, and handed over to the lieichs-TreuJmnd Gesellschaft (Federal Trustee Company) for breaking up.Although these figures are extremely satisfactory, it is certain that a large number of arms have nut been handed in. The surrenders in the danger centres of the industrial districts, and in Bavaria, East Prussia, *and the country districts generally, are believed to have been negligible. ,It remains to be seen what further steps the German Government can now take to carry out further forcible searches for arms on a large scale;It is considered that the German Government have so far done everything possible to ensure the surrender of arms by the civil population. If the results as reported above are correct, it shows a most praiseworthy effort on the part of the German Government to fulfil their Spa undertaking, in which they have spared neither trouble nor expense.5. The Export of War Material. The export of war material is forbidden by Article 170 of the Treaty.There have been numerous reports of attempted smuggling of arms from Germany, and at the Boulogne Conference, Germany was called on to pass the necessary laws to forbid the export of war material in accordance with Article 170.On the 22nd December, the German Government promulgated a law, which had received the assent of the Reichstag and the Reichsrat, prohibiting the import and export of war material in Germany.Meanwhile, the German police have in certain cases taken action to prevent the export of war material.(i. Manufacture of war material. Article 168 prohibits the manufacture of war material, except in factories authorized by the Allies.The manufacture of war material lias been restricted by the Commission of Control to the minimum necessary for the replacement of stocks for the 100,000 army.Up to the present 3,251 German munition factories have been inspected ; 2,652 have been given a free certificate by the Commission.This progress is considered satisfactory.(b.) The abolition of the laws constituting universal military service in Germany, and the establishment of a system of voluntary enlistment for the future German Army (Articles 173 and 174).1. In August, 1920, the Reichstag passed a law abolishing the obligation of compulsory service in the Reich.The Commission of Control objected to certain legal technicalities in this law, and amendments are to be included in the new German Wehrgesetz (Defence Law), which is being laid before the Reichstag shortly, and which will repeal all previous laws relating to compulsory service. The Wehrgesetz has been studied by the Commission of Control, and certain modifications in the text are to be made.Meanwhile, in actual fact, compulsory service has ceased to exist in Germany, and the Reichsheer consists entirely of voluntarily enlisted men.This is considered satisfactory.2. The law abolishing compulsory service, mentioned above, contained a clause to the effect that all men in the new 100,000 Reichsheer (Federal Army) are to be enlisted for 12 years&apos; service.The Germans are now enlisting men in the Reichsheer for 12 years&apos; service with the Colours.In accord with the Commission of Control, non-commissioned officers and men enlisting for 12 years in the 100,000 Army are being permitted to count the time spent in the old army, and in the transitional lieichsicehr, as part of their service with the Colours.This is considered satisfactory.
(c.) The reduction of the German armed forces to the establishments laid down in the Peace Treaty (Articles 15!), 160, 162, 103, 177).I. Ihichswehr.   By the decision of the Spa Conference, the time limit for the reduction of the Reichswehr was extended as follows : To 150,000 by 1st October, 1920. To 100,000 by 1st January, 1921.The Commission of Control report that the reduction to 150,000 was correctly carried out.The German Government state that the Regular Army [Reichsheer) was reduced to 100,000 (the Treaty establishment) by the 1st January, 1921. This reduction has not yet been definitely checked by the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control, but it is considered that the reduction of the Reichsheer has been carried out in all essentials.The 100,000 Reichsheer is still in possession of large surplus stocks of equipment, which the German Government wish to retain for training purposes, and as reserve stocks. The Commission of Control have demanded that this material should be surrendered.The reduction of the German Regular Army is satisfactory.2. Police and Gendarmerie, (1.) The Treaty hud down that the strength of the German Police and Gendarmerie, was not to exceed the 1913 establishments, with an allowance for (he increase in population.(2.) The Boulogne Conference permitted the German Government to increase the Police and Gendarmerie up to the following maximum establishments : Civil Police.........      ...   150,000Gendarmerie       ...      ...      ...    17,000These establishments are to include police forces in. the Neutral Zone and in the occupied territory.(3.) The &quot;Boulogne Conference stipulated that the German Police must be demilitarized, the Sicherheitxpolizei disbanded, and the armament of the police reduced to that sanctioned by the Commission of Control.(4.) On the 4th October the Prussian Government issued a Decree for the dissolution of the Sicherlieitspolizei, and for the transformation and reorganization of the Prussian police force.The Commission of Control have subsequently received copies of the Decrees for 15 other German States. In its Note of the 3rd January, regarding the Police, the German Government states that the SicherheitspoUzei in Mecklenburg Schwerin and in Bremen have actually been disbanded, although Decrees have not yet been received by the Commission of Control.In the remaining small states no force of Sicherheitspolizei &apos;has ever existed. *   Orders for the transformation and reorganization of the Sicherheitspolizei have, therefore, been issued throughout Germany.The reorganization of the. Police is proceeding slowly, but steadily, and is the subject of discussion between the German Government and the Commission of Control.The great majority of the Sicherheitspolizei are being incorporated in the new State Police.ifSchutzpolizei), increased in accordance with the Boulogne decision.Both the disarmament and the orders issued by the State Governments for the reorganization of the Police, may be considered generally satisfactory, but a full report has not yet been received from the Commission of Control.3, Unauthorized forces (Article 177). (1.) There are still numerous illegal armed organizations in Germany; the steps taken by the Federal Government to disarm and disband such organizations have so far.had little effect.(2.) In April, in response to the demand of the Commission of Control, the Federal Government issued a decree dissolving the Reichszenlrale dar Einwohnerwehr (Federal Headquarters of the Civic Guards) and requested the various States to disband this force. The Einwokneriveh&apos;en were subsequently officially disbanded in Prussia, (excepting the province of East Prussia), Saxony, and some of the smaller States, but little progress was made in recovering the arms issued to the various units.In its Note of the 2nd January, the German Government, states, however, that the majority of the weapons reported by the Selbslschutz organizations, except in Bavaria and East Prussia, have already been handed over, and that the surrender of these weapons will be completed by the end of January.This statement has not yet been commented on by the Commission of Control.
The German Federal Government lias made considerable efforts to carry out the dissolution of the Einwohnerwehren, but points out that this is really a question for the individual States, and that the Federal Government is, in fact, powerless with the small military forces at its disposal to compel the States to dissolve; the EinwohnerwehrenIn Bavaria, Wurttemberg and East Prussia, on the other hand, no attempt has been made by the authorities to disband the Einwohnerwehr-\ the State Governments have, on the contrary, made every effort to support this organization.A Press report of the 10th January states that the inhabitants of Bremen, by a majority of 98,715 to 74,015 votes, have refused to disband their local -Einwohnerwehr, owing to the present unsettled conditions.(3.) In Bavaria, the Einwohnerwehr has become a national question. The force is believed to be about 300,000 strong ; 50,000 men, apparently all armed, were present at the Munich rifle meeting in September, when the Bavarian Premier, v. Kahr, and Dr. Escherich proclaimed to enthusiastic meetings, that under no circumstances would the Einwohnerwehr be disbanded.The Bavarian Eimvohnerwehr contains all the law-abiding and best elements in the Bavarian population ; the country is still obsessed with a fear and hatred of Bolshevism, due to the Soviet regime in Munich in April, 1919, and the general public feels that a disbandment of this force would moan a certain return to the previous state of lawlessness and disorder. The Bavarian Government is, at present, certainly not in a position to disband the Eimvohnerwe.hr forthwith, even if it were desirous of so doing. The Bavarian Government is dependent on the Einwohnerwehr, and could not exist in opposition to it.Further factors operating against the disarmament of the Eimvohnerwehr in Bavaria are the Separatist and Monarchist tendencies, which find some support in the Einivohnerivehr.(4.) Conditions in Wiirttemberg are generally similar to those obtaining in Bavaria, the mentality of the people resembling that of the Bavarians; the population is not industrial, and is generally law-abiding.5. During the summer a large number of branches of a society known as the Orgesch appeared in Prussia and the other Northern and Central States. [Ch&apos;gesch^ Organization Escherich, is an anti-Bolshevik society, avowedly formed Avith the objects of supporting law and order, the rights of property and the Constitutional Government, and combating any attempt at a Bight or Left Putsch. Its organizer is Dr. Escherich, the creator of the Bavarian Eimvohnerwehr?)The Orgesch was declared illegal by the Prussian and Saxon authorities, but the Society has been trying to obtain a legal reversion of this decision, and Dr. Escherich addressed a strongly Avorded open manifesto of protest to the Federal President. The Prussian Minister of Justice has declared that the Orgesch Society does not contravene the decrees forbidding illegal armed organizations, in accordance with the Treaty, and is therefore within the law. The members of this Society, mostly members &apos;of the former Zeitfreiwiltigen and Einwohnerwehren, are certainly to a large extent in the possession of arms.Note. Confusion is liable to arise in press reports between the Einwohnerwehr and the district branches of the Orgesch. In States such as Bavaria and Wurttemberg and in East&apos;Prussia, where the Einwolinenvehr has not been officially disbanded, the Orgesch Society is merely a patriotic organization of citizens, most of whose members probably belong to the Einwohnerwehr. In Prussia and the other States in which the Einwohnerwehr has been officially dissolved, the Orgesch has more ambitious aims ; the Society proposes to take over all members of the former Einwohnerwehr, and to provide for a service of law and order such as the local Einwohnerwehren formerly provided.(6.) Recently a number of so-called self-protection organizations (Selbstschutz organizations) have also been formed in North German towns. These are merely the Einwohnerwehr under a different title, and are certainly in possession of arms.(7.) In East Prussia, the unauthorized local forces are also strong, and are supported by the bulk of the population of the province. The isolated situation of the province, and the fear of fresh Bolshevik aggression against Poland in the spring, make the population very nervous and opposed to the dissolution of the local Einwohnerwehr, especially in vieAv of the small garrison of regular troops allotted to East Prussia.(8.) The peasants in the country districts, and to a lesser extent the Spartacist elements in the industrial districts, have so far shown little or no sign of handing
in their arms; it is certain that the organizations of both these classes are in possession of arms to a considerable extent.(9.) From the above, it is obvious that, as regards the disbandment of unauthorized local forces and armed organizations, the situation, is far from satisfactory.This can hardly be ascribed as in any way due to the German Federal Government. Germany is still suffering from the shock of the revolution, and the frequent armed risings in 1919, and the spring of 1920.The opposing parties are filled with hatred and suspicion, and both Reactionaries and the Spartacists are afraid to hand in their arms, for fear of being left defenceless in face of their enemies.The Einwohnerwehr, and the Orgesch and Sclbstschutz organizations are mainly composed of those elements in the population, whose chief wish is to preserve law and order.(10.) These unauthorized formations present no immediate militaiy danger to the Allies; the only danger is that in the future they may form the,basis for a gradual rebuilding of a National Army in Germany. The danger of unauthorized formations has been consistently emphasized by the General Staff, who, mindful of the events of 1800-13, have been and are still anxious to prevent the establishment of any system, that may eventually result in the re-establishment of a National Army in Germany. It must not be forgotten that, like the French and other Continental nations, the Germans are accustomed to universal compulsory military service, and have long regarded it as an advantage, and indeed as a necessity.(11.) Improved food conditions and the supply of raw materials should remove the danger of outbreaks from the Spartacists and the unemployed.The gradual strengthening of the constitutional, government in Germany should make any chance of an armed coup detat by the extremists of either side certain of failure, and, therefore, unlikely.Without any such gradual improvement in the general situation, it is considered that no action by the Allies will be really effective in completely disarming the civil population, and bringing about the actual dissolution of the unauthorized protective forces. Re-imposition of the blockade would almost certainly bring about a general Communist rising, and possibly the disappearance of any form of settled government in Germany. Military action, such as the occupation of the Ruhr, would probably lead to a coup d&apos;etat by the reactionaries, and civil war and anarchy in Germany.III. General Summary.(a.) The following conclusions can be drawn from the foregoing statement: 1. The surrender and destruction of arms in Germany, with the exception of those held by the Einwohnerwehr and other armed organizations [Le., rifles and, to a certain extent, machine guns) are proceeding satisfactorily and are nearing completion as regards the main items (guns, machine guns and rifles).2. The German Army has been reduced to the Treaty Establishment; the force is voluntarily enlisted, and Germany has been deprived of the power of building up a large potential reserve by means of a short service army.3. Germany has ceased to be a military danger to the Allies for a considerable period of time.Her power of preparing a National Army, capable of tremendous expansion at the outbreak of war, has been removed ; the guns essential for the armament of such a National Army have been destroyed. 4. The German Government has, m the main, carried out the military clauses of the Treaty, as far as lay in its power, and has worked loyally with the Commission of Control, in spite of obstruction by subordinate military authorities.General Bingham reports that he considers the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control can be reduced by about 50 per cent, at th- end of March, 1921.5. The only real violation of the military clauses of the Treaty is the failure to disband and disarm the Orgesch, and the Bavarian, Wurttemberg, and East - Prussian Einwohnerwehren.As regards this question, it is considered that the German Government is not strong enough to carry out the immediate disbandment and disarma-
General Staff,War Office,15th January, 1921.merit of these organizations, the regular armed forces having already been reduced, in accordance with the terms of the Treaty and of the Spa Conference.6. In general, therefore, the execution by the German Government of the military clauses of the Treaty has been satisfactory, and the main object of these clauses has been attained, -Le., the removal of the menace of German aggression, at all events for a, considerable period.(b.) General review of the present situation. Expert military opinion has always regarded the effective disarmament of Germany, and the destruction of all surplus war material, as the main essential in rendering Germany incapable of further aggressive action against the Allies, rather than the reduction of the German standing Army. For years to come Germany will have millions of trained men at her disposal, but can-not form an Army of these, unless she possesses the necessary war material.The figures given above (paragraph II. (a) 2), which only deal with the most important types of arms and ammunition, and do not include war stores and equipment, show what an enormous task the Armaments Sub-Commission of the Military Corn-mission of Control have had to carry out. During the last six months the destruction of guns and war material of every description has made considerable progress, and, although much remains to be done, the work has undoubtedly proceeded sufficiently far to render Germany incapable of waging an offensive campaign against the Allies for some time to come. In general, the German Government lias shown good faith in its methods of dealing with this extremely important matter, and the surrender and destruction of arms, ammunition and all kinds of Avar material, have been speeded up in a satisfactory way since the Spa Conference last July.With regard to the reduction of the Regular Army to 100,000 men, the abolition of universal compulsorv military service and demilitarisation of the police force, certain points remain to be enforced by the Commission of Control.There remains the question of the Einwohnerwehren, Orgesch and similar unauthorized formations. In view of the Bolshevik menace on Germany&apos;s eastern frontier, and the Communist agitation in the country, especially in North Germany, it is not unnatural that the loyal and law-abiding majority of the German people should desire to guarantee their security by banding themselves together in local defensive organizations, in order to make up for the weakness of the Regular Armv, and to meet the real danger of anarchy and Bolshevism. Nor is it unnatural that the. anxiety to maintain such armaments, and to give them adequate arms, e.g., the proportion of rifles and machine guns, should be strongest in East Prussia, which is nearest to Soviet Russia, and in Bavaria, which lias experienced some &quot;of the horrors of Bolshevism. Although these organizations present no immediate danger, and although their present &quot;object may be the preservation of law and order in Germany, there is no doubt as to the absolute necessity for their ultimate suppression If allowed to continue indefinitely they may become a real military danger by forming the basis of a national army, and by constituting an aid to possible future mobilization. The statutes of these societies are indeed well adapted to maintain the spirit of military discipline throughout the country, and it is of supreme importance to prevent Germany from repeating Prussia&apos;s tactics of 1806-1813.It is, therefore, imperative to fix a time limit for the disarmament, disbandment, and total abolition of all unauthorized military or semi-military forces or societies in Germany. The Paris Conference is faced with the necessity of ensuring the above, while, at the same time, enabling the German Federal Government to safeguard the interests of the law-abiding population in Germany during an exceptionally difficult

Article 42.-No Fortifications to be Maintained or Constructed West of a Line drawn 50 kilometres to the East of the Rhine.This is being complied with.2. Article 43.-No Troops allowed in the Neutral Zone. Permanent Works for Mobilization forbidden there.1. The German troops evacuated the Neutral Zone by 1st October, 1920, in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Council at Spa.2. Permanent works for mobilization are not beinff maintained in the Neutral Zone. %3. Articles 159, 160, 163 (as modified by the Spa Conference, July, 1920).-Demobilization and reduction to 150,000 by 1st October, 1920, and to 100,000 (7 Infantry and 3 Cavalry Divisions) by 1st January, 1921.Article 1j9 1. The German military forces have been progressively demobilized, and no units or formations of the old army, of any military value, exist.2. The Commission of Control demanded that the suppression of all De-mobilization Staffs should be completed by 1st January, 1921. The German Government issued a Decree on 8th November, 1920, ordering the suppression of all Demobilization Staffs by 31st December, 1920, but formed supplementary Zweigstellen,. with a small clerical staff, in their place. The Commission of Control has protested against the formation of these offices.Articles 160 and 163. 1. The German Army (Reichsheer) has been reduced to 100,000 by 1st January, 1921.2. The 100,000 Army is, in general, being organized in accordance with the Treaty, as regards command, staffs and units; the organization shows a slight divergency in certain details from the Treaty organization. The attention of the German Govern-ment lias been drawn to this fact by the Commission of Control, and the question is still being discussed.3. The Great General Staff has been dissolved; certain sections, such as the topographical and historical sections, have been transferred to Civil Ministries.4. The question of the military personnel in the War Ministry and the Administra-tions is at present under discussion between the German Government and the Commis-sion of Control. A number of administrative services have been transferred to Civil Ministries, e.g., &quot; Q.&quot; services to the Ministry of Finance; Medical services to the Ministry of Labour ; former recruiting offices to a civil department dealing with pensions and claims of discharged soldiers.4. Article 161. Administrative Services (civil personnel) to be reduced in each class to one-tenth of Establishment of Budget of 1913. (An increase in the number of officials was sanctioned at Spa.)A control of the civilian personnel is difficult, owing to the transfer of certain services to civil departments.   [See paragraph 4, under Article 160.)The Commission of Control is engaged in investigating the question of civilian personnel.5. Article 162.-Number of employes or officials of German States, such as Customs Officers, Forest Guards and Coastguards, not to exceed strength of 1913, and not to be assembled for military training. The number of police only to be increased in proportion to increase of population.(Germany was allowed 150,000 police, plus 17,000 &quot; Gendarmerie,&quot; by the Boulogne Conference, June, 1920.)1. The German Police Force and the Gendarmerie are being satisfactorily, but slowly, reorganized, in accordance with the decisions of the Boulogne Conference, and(8877) B
tho stipulations of the Commission of Control. But the Police in the Neutral Zone are still armed with heavy and light machine guns in excess of the numbers permitted. The German Government, has been informed that the armament of the Police in the Neutral Zone must conform to that of the Police in the rest of Germany,For full details, see Part II.,1 subheading (c), paragraph 2, of the foregoing Memorandum.2. Germany has no special Coastguards, such duties being performed by Customs officers.   The latter and the Forest Guards have no military organization.6. Article 164.-Armament allowed to Germany until admitted as a member of the League of Nations for 100,000 Army.1. The German armament is being reduced in proportion to the reduction of the Reichsheer and Sicherheitspolizei.2, The final inspection by the Commission of Control could not be carried out until after 1st January, 1921, when the Army was finally reduced to the 100,000 establishment.7. Article 165.-Maximum number of Guns, Machine Guns, Trench Mortars, Rifles, and amount of Ammunition allowed during the period of the reduction of the Army to 100,000.See Articles 164, 167 and 169.8. Article 166. Maximum stocks of Ammunition authorized.See Article 164.9. Article 167. Limitation of Armament and Munitions in Fortresses which Germany is allowed to retain.1. The German Government desired to retain a large stock of guns, machine guns, Minenwerfer, rifles and war material, including mobile armament, in the 14 fortresses on the southern and eastern frontiers of Germany.2. The Commission of Control decided that: (a.) Guns can only be allowed which are actually in position or for which genuine positions actually exist.General Bingham considers that this decision should be modified in the case of Konigsberg, owing to its isolated position in East Prussia, and would allow about 150 guns for this fortress. A similar view was expressed by Marshal Foch at the Spa Conference. The German Government has appealed to the Conference of Ambassadors, and has asked to be allowed to retain 390 guns for Konigsberg, 168 guns for Kiistrin, and 20 guns for Boyen.(6.) No stocks of surplus rifles, machine guns and Minenwerfer may. be retained in the fortresses.3. The surrender and destruction of surplus armament in fortresses is proceeding satisfactorily.10. Article 168.-Control and closing down of Factories.1. The German Government has been informed that two factories for guns, two, for machine guns, and two for rifles may be kept; the Germans have also been informed of the capacity for output, to which these factories are to be restricted.2. The following table shows the situation as regards German munition factories : 1Total number of factories known to the Commission of Control.	Factories inspected.	Factories given a free certificate.6,318	3,251	2,652This Article is being executed satisfactorily.
11. Article 169.-Surrender of War Material.The surrender and destruction of war material is proceeding satisfactorily, with the exception of the question of arms in the possession of the civil population.
