In the shipbuilding industry, the cancellation of orders is seriously affecting employment among skilled workmen,
although ship-repair work has been more brisk, especially in the Welsh ports. There are no signs of improvement in the cotton trade, and further curtailment of produc-tion in the Egyptian section is expected. It is reported that the decrease in prices has resulted in a loss of  18,000,000 on the cotton now warehoused in Liverpool. Workers in the gold and silver trades in Sheffield are expecting to be put on short time. The tinplate industry in South Wales is in a serious position, and acute depression marks the motor engineering and metal trades generally. Short time continues in the woollen, lace, hosiery, and boot and shoe industries. The position in the latter is becoming worse, and firm?, who expected to resume business after Christmas have not been able to do so, A number of the smaller firms are entirely without orders&quot;, and have closed down indefinitely. In the building industry a large number of painters are unemployed.II. EMERGENCY WORK.The Prime Minister made a statement in the House of Commons on the 19th October on the proposals of the Government to provide against unemployment. He outlined schemes for employing a large number of fit ex-Service men in connection with the Housing Programme, on which negotiations with the trade unions were proceeding; and schemes for anticipating a four years&apos; programme for Arterial Roads in London and in the provinces; whilst at the same time pressing forward with the Ministry of Transports programme of road classification and maintenance grants.A further statement was made by the Minister of Labour on the 21st December, indicating that the further proposals of the Government included: a final endeavour to secure an agreement with the building trades for the admission of ex-Service men; a rapid extension of road construction schemes; the distribution by the Unemploy-ment Grants Committee, under the Chairmanship of Yiscount St. Davids, of a sum of  3,000,000 for the purpose of assisting local authorities on relief schemes other than house building and road work; and the amendment of the Unemployment Insurance Act (1920) in order to enable benefit to be paid to workpeople who had been unemployed since the Act came into operation and could not therefore qualify for benefit.ROAD WORK PROGRAMME.
