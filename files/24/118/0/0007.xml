1/Telegram from High Commissioner, Mesopotamia; to Secretary of State for India,dated 2Qth December 1920.123 S. Your telegram of 22nd December, 4210. With reference to first sentence, please see third clause of my telegram of the 26th October last, 12987. There is perhaps some misunderstanding.I have always understood it to be the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government that we should not impose a ruler, but should prefer to leave the choice to the will of the people. You will remember that, when -Faisaks candidature was discussed in Cabinet Council last August, the Prime Minister and Lord Curzon, on return from meeting with French representatives at Lympne, stated that their tentative enquiries had been met with such a storm of opposition, that they had had to agree to abandon the idea for the present, but had made the reservation that, in the event of their subsequently receiving a strong demand for Faisal from the people of Mesopotamia, they must retain full discretion to revive proposal (or words to that effect).Since my arrival in Mesopotamia, both 1 and members of my stall have frequently been sounded as to what predilections of His Majesty&apos;s Government were in the matter of future ruler; and under my instructions the attitude has consistently been main-tained, that both this question and. the choice of precise form of Government, were problems for the people themselves to decide. By the same analogy 1 have definitely stated here that this was one of the questions upon which, the (? contemplated) Congress was being convened to express their view.From our own point of view this was the only attitude which could properly be maintained, unless and until we had made up our own minds that we wanted to push a particular candidate.As regards the people of this country, I am doubtful if the Congress will ever reach a result on the question of the ruler, and believe that majority would prefer to have the question decided for them, or at any rate that we should give them a lead; also that a great majority are in favour of an outsider rather than an inhabitant of Irak, and among outsiders a Sherif for choice.If the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government makes it desirable to expedite a decision, I think it can be done without waiting for the elections, and if so, the sooner the better. I should, of course, like to be consulted further before any other steps were taken, but if, for example, die way is now clear for Faisal, I think, primd facie, that the best way to give him an opening would be to inspire a Reuter to the effect that the French had now withdrawn their opposition to Faisaks candidature, and that, if the people of Irak wanted him, His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to accept him.   He would then be able formally to offer himself.The placation of Mesopotamian candidates needs a little strategy, but I will submit my views on that point if occasion arises. Meanwhile, I merely give you an indication of my views in case situation should develop quickly.Telegram from High Commissioner, Mesopotamia, to Secretary of State for India,dated 20th December 1920..15339 Almis. British Chamber of Commerce are to-day. telegraphing following resolutions to Secretary of Associated Chambers. London, for action and support:  &quot; The British Chamber of Commerce, Baghdad, respectfully begs to direct (? again) the attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Chambers resolution, dated 27th duly 1920. Chamber has since noticed with the deepest concern the clamour which has arisen in the Home Press for the immediate evacuation of the wdiole or the greater portion of Mesopotamia,- and reading in ReuteFs telegrams just received that this clamour has found an echo in Parliament, wishes once more to represent and emphasise its views on the certain results of hasty evacuation. No one with, experience in Mesopotamia can for a moment doubt that the results would be massacres, destruction of property, and general anarchy, extending not only over the whole region evacuated, but also over adjacent countries, one of the consequences being the loss to Great Britain of a flourishing and growing traide.

Chamber strongly contests the idea that the solution of the problem is to be found in the retention of the province of -Basra.   This would be splitting the country into two, and the Basra province could only then be held as fortified area, an area without any natural defences or boundaries, the inhabitants of which would be speedily infected by the anarchy reigning in the country evacuated.   The Chamber fails to understand by what right Great Britain, having evaded her responsibility in the northern territory could forcibly retain the province of Basra.   Chamber of Commerce points out that the British Forces by their occupation of Mesopotamia destroyed the only form of Government the country had known for centuries, and that evacuation at the present time will leave it without any Government worthy of the name.   Thus the final result of British intervention in Mesopotamia would be its complete ruin, for which the responsibility will rest on Great Britain.   The Chamber fully recognises the urgent need of lightening the burden on the British taxpayer, and believes that this can be attained with safety and honour along the lines as at present contemplated . and inaugurated by His Majesty&apos;s Government.   The Chamber, however, ventures to express opinion that large economies could be effected immediately by drastic reductions in Military Department, which appears to be out of all proportion to the requirements even of the present combatant Army Departments, whose activities are not confined to military needs.   The Chamber respectfully prays His Majesty&apos;s Government to hold steadfastly to the policy of establishing a stable Arab government thus fulfilling the solemn pledges repeatedly given to the people of the country.
