This Pocvnie.it is the Pioperty of ^^I^f^^l &apos;ui. western:u,Nc Malays Government, 53Circulated by the Secretary of State for India. RET.gram from Secretary of Stale for India to Sir Percy Cox, No. 4387,dated 31st December 1920.The suggestion in your telegram No. (R.) 124 S., of 27th December, that Shereef Faisal should become King at once is under consideration. Cabinet would like to have further details as to how far his candidature would be acceptable to the various elements of population, both Arab and non-Arab, including inhabitants of Baghdad and other cities. Would he he likely to be elected bv notables? We understand, that if he were so elected and supported by British Government, you would expect to be able to reduce total Army of Occupation to one division and one brigade within 12 months of election.Telegram from Secretary of State for India to High Commissioner, Mesopotamia,dated 1st January 1921.3. Secret. My secret telegram of 31st December, 4387. Please reply before Tuesday, if possible.Telegram from High Commissioner, Mesopotamia, to Secretary of State for India,dated 2nd January 1921.148 S. 2nd January. Your telegrams 4387 and 3. Before I can reply to your quest ions 1 should like to be clear (? on my own) position, as your telegrams to me, and War Office telegram to General Officers Commanding, do not altogether coincide.My telegram No. 124 S. of 27th December was despatched under the impression that I was dealing with a War Office proposal to withdraw to the Basrah Vilayat. On the 30th December, however, War Office telegram No. 87319 of 3rd December was communicated to me, and from that I learnt that I had been dealing with provisional decision of Cabinet taken previous to 23rd December to withdraw to a position at Basrah as early as possible.On the above premises my considered opinion is that, if we are going to undertake mandate, it is essential that we should continue to hold what we do now, and that with reasonable good fortune we could hope to do with one division for Mosul and Baghdad Vilayats and one brigade for Basrah Vilayat commencing from one year (? subsequent to) election or establishment of Faisal or one of his brothers as ruler. I am of opinion that, if we cannot hold Baghdad and Mosul Vilayats, we must refuse mandate altogether, and that in the latter case we should hold only the port of Basrah under full British administration, with so much of the surrounding territory as is necessary for protection of the port and oilfields.I can now deal with the project for bringing in Faisal.Local considerations connected with present provisional Government and coming National Congress make it extremely undesirable that I should queer the pitch by consulting notables of various elements of the population at this stage. His Majesty&apos;s Government must therefore accept or reject my personal opinion on the subject, and the initiative as regards Faisal must come from your side.As regards the coming election, the outlook is as follows. The two most prominent and probably the two only candidates from inside Irak, would be Sayyid Talib, whom the best elements do not want, and the Naqib who, in speaking with me has always disclaimed any ambitions for himself, but who might be inclined to accept the role in the interests of his family. It is unlikely that either of these would get a majority, and the probable choice is so much in the air, that our friends believe that, if the Congress assembles without any inkling of our own wishes being made known, it will either fail to record a vote in favour of anyone, or more probably will succumb to the influence of the extremists, and will vote for &quot; No Mandate.&quot;Consequently our friends are confidentially urging upon us to give some indication of our wishes. I have (? hitherto) persevered in the reply that we want people to decide for themselves, and I still (? think that we) here should maintain that attitude, 3057 100 1/21
because in present circumstances were we to let it appear that we should not support Naqib or Sayyid Talib, if either of them can get a majority, we should turn them both against us, and the present (? useful) temporary Government would collapse. His Majesty&apos;s Government need first to decide definitely in principle whether, on the basis of my suggestion, they will accept the mandate or not. If decision is in the affirmative, mandate should be published at once, and that having been done Faisal (or his brother, as the case may be) should proceed to Paris or Switzerland, and send following telegrams to Mesopotamia. Firstly, identical telegrams to Jaafar Pasha and Nuri Saud telling them the opposition to his (? candidature) for Mesopotamia has been withdrawn, and that they should now inform his adherents that he oilers himself for throne of Irak under British mandate.Secondly, to the Naqib, announcing his candidature and adding that, if elected, he hopes the Naqib would support him and become his first President of Council or Prime Minister.Thirdly, to Sayyid Talib, adding that, if elected, he would ask Talib to become his first Minister of Interior, and ask for TatiJVs support.Talib and Naqib would then come to me and ask if FaisaTs candidature had our support. I should reply that, when he was first proposed some months ago, His Majesty&apos;s Government had decided that, if the people of Irak wanted him and the French Government did not oppose it, we should, primd facie, (?be ready to) accept him, and that no doubt the position is the same still.My belief, and that of those of my stall on whose judgment I rely, is that such an announcement of fait accompli would be a welcome relief to majority of people of Mesopotamia, and that it would have support of moderate element among Nationalists,, while it would take the wind out of the sails of the young extremists, who want to get rid of mandate altogether.After (? announcement of) Faisal&apos;s candidature, we should soon learn whether public opinion in his favour was so general as to make it unnecessary to wait for elections, or whether we should allow elections to take their course, and allow Faisal to canvass for himself like others.Subject to seeing first effect of his announcement, I think primd facie that he might then come here at once, and. work in his own interests, but that would be decided later if and when project develops.
