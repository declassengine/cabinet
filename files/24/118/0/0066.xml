TURKISH SUBJECTS ACCUSES OF BREACHES v Of &quot;flf^. &quot;LAf 3 &apos; OF &quot;V/AH.Mcmor andua fry the Attorn*y Oorieral and Soiloitor general *1.       By Articles 226 and 227 of the1 Treaty of Sevres with Turkey it is provided :**Article 226*The Turkish Government recognises the right of the Allied Powers to &quot;bring before military tribunals persons accused of having committed acts in violation of tho laws and - customs of war,   Such persons aha11, if found guilty, be sentenced to punishments laid down by law,     This provision will apply notwithstanding any proceedings or prosecution before a tribunal in Turlrey or in the territory of her allies.The Turkish Government shall hand over to the Allied Powers or to such one of them as shall so request all persons accused of having committed an aot in violation of tho laws and customs of war, who are specified either by name or by the rank, office or employment which they held under the Turkish authorities,Artiale 227.&apos;Persons guilty of criminal aats against the nationals of one of the Allied Powers shall be brought before the military tribunals of that Power.Persons guilty of criminal acts against the nationals of more than one of the Allied Powers shall be brought before military tribunals composed of members of the military tribunals of the Powers concerned aIn every case the accused shall be entitled to nwno his own counsel.&apos;
2,   There are at tho present time detained at Halts 8 Turks whose detention is maintained because they are alleged to &quot;be guilty of violations of the Laws of War in their treatment of British Prisoners. They are2679, Tewfilc Mehmet, 2707. ?&quot;&quot;azlum Bey.2680. Ahmet Tewfik Bey.      271O. Hakki Ibrahim Bey, 2694. Djerml Bey.     , 2732. Suleiman ffuraan Pasha.2700. Ahmed Djevad Bey.      274^. Tahir Bey.3.   There is some doubt as to the identity of 2679* Tewfik Mehmet.   But subject to this doubt in this one case, all the cases have been considered by the Attorney General&apos;s Committee of Enquiry into the Breaches of the Laws of War, and recommended for prosecution.The evidence on which the charges are based is summarized at pp. 19? - 235 -of the Committee&apos;a Last Report.4.    It will be seen from these pages that the charges are for  roes end continued ill-treatment of the prisoners. In the case of Mazlurn Bey (see p,195 of above Report) the charges are based,upon brutal conduct, and attested by very numerous witnesses.5*   The Treaty of Sevres has not yet been ratified, and hence Articles 226, 227 are not legally in force.   But lapse of time is interfering, and must seriously interfere with the. possibility of. establishing the oases against these 8 detained.Turks.   The witnesses are now scattered and may be difficult to trace.  . In.any event .having&apos;regard to the number of them, from which a selection must be made, it is in our opinion undesirable that the matter should be allowed to drift;   and that no- action/.preliminary or
otherwise, should &quot;be token at the present nime.     It ia clear today that it will take considerable time and labour to prepare the evidence for trial.6.   According to our information, the &quot;criminal acts&quot; with which &quot;the accused are charge d were committed against the nationals of only one of the Allied Powers, namely Gret.t Britain.   Therefore under Article 227, the accused ought to he brought before a British Military tribunal.7*   We put ch.1.3 memorandum forward in order that:-(a) It may be ascertained through the proper channel that Article 22? applies and that no other Allied Power deailrcs to join in composing a Joint Mill-tar y Tribunal to try the accused.(b) Steps may be taken to establish the requisite Military Tribunal so that it can begin its work as sooh as ever tho Treaty is put in force *(c) Authority may be given to us to have the evidence, and witnesses, prepared for the trials as soon as ever they can be opened^ and to incur the expense necessary to carry the above steps into effect.(Initialled)   G. H. (Initialled) E. V.* P.l8th January, 1921.
