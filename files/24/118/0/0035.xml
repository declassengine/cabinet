PART I-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.The industrial situation remains very quiet, largely, no doubt, in consequence of the very serious unemployment position. The strike of the shipyard joiners against the proposed reduction of their wages continues, and is now beginning to affect other workers employed in the shipbuilding industry. Arising out of the strike of miners in the Khondda coalfield, which was temporarily settled on the 27tli December, the executive of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation met the chairman of the Ocean Coal Co. on the 3rd January, and it was agreed that the eleven men whose dismissal led to the strike should be found employment at other pits owned by the company. It has also been announced that the advance in wages payable to colliery workers under the terms of settlement of the recent coal strike/15 will be increased for the period, from the 3rd to the 31st January, to 3s. Gel. per shift to persons of 18 years and over, Is. del. per shift to persons between 16 and 17 years, and Is. 3^(1. per shift to persons under 16 years.Public attention remains concentrated on the serious unemployment position. At the special conference of the Labour Party held at the Central Hall, Westminster, on the 29th December, to consider the situation, a resolution was passed endorsing the principle that either work or maintenance should be provided for the unemployed. The Government have also, during the week, put forward proposals for the general adoption of short-time working as a means of alleviating the present distress. The Minister has written to all Joint Industrial Councils, Trade Boards and Interim Industrial Eecon-struction Committees, to employers&apos; organisations and to trade unions, urging the desirability of dividing the existing volume of work to the widest possible extent among the whole body of the wage-earning classes. The Governments intention is not only that the work should be spread for a longer time over the existing number of employees, but also that employment should be given to some of those who have already been dis-charged; and it is suggested that the Governments proposals should be carried out by co-operation between trade unions and. employers. These proposals have, however, been very severely criticised by many trade union leaders, on the ground that they make no provision that the means of the workpeople shall not fall below subsistence level, and also that a serious reduction in the real wages of the workers is likely to ensue. The proposals of the Government for the absorption of unemployed ex-Servicemen into the building-industry were considered on the 29th and 30th December by representatives of the building-trade unions ; and the Minister was informed that the proposals had been referred to the separate unions for consideration, but that it is improbable that a decision would be arrived at before the end of the month. Unemployment in the cotton industry is receiving -the attention of the Cotton Reconstruction Board, formerly the Cotton Control Board, who are considering the question of devoting a portion of the Board&apos;s funds to relieving cases of distress amongst employees in the cotton industry. In this connection, it is also worthy of note that, in consequence of the heavy drain upon the funds of the Heywoocl, Castleton, Norden and District Weavers, Winders and Reelers&apos; Association, owing to the present unemployment, the association have been compelled to reduce their benefits by half.The report of the Labour Commission of Inquiry on the conditions obtaining in Ireland has been issued during the week, and was considered at the special conference of the Labour Party referred to above. It is proposed that a national campaign shall shortly be opened by the party on this question. The controversy as regards the position of the building guilds who have recently entered into building contracts with various local authorities has been forced into prominence during the week by the resignation by Mr. Stephen Easten, president of the National Federation of Building Trades Employers, of his position as Honorary Director of Housing Production under the Ministry of Health.
General Situation-continued.The tendency of the trade unions to consolidate their forces, by amalgamation, is strikingly illustrated by the coming into existence on the 1st January of the five new unions referred to below.Miss Mary Macarthur, general secretary of the National Federation of Women-Workers and of the Women&apos;s Trade Union League, died in London on the 1st January.The Unemployment Position.The number of H.M. Forces and merchant seamen out-of-work donation policies lodged in Great Britain on the 24th December was 227,807, comprising 227,368 for men and 439 for women. In addition, there were 7,044 policies lodged by short-time workers, 7,027 for men and 17 for women. On the 17th December there were 223,394 policies lodged, 222,930 by men and &apos;458 by women. On the same date there were 5,458 policies lodged by short-time workers, 5,412 for men and 40 by women.On the 24th December, in Great Britain, 324,417 unemployment books, 183,008 for males and 141,409 for females, remained lodged under the Unemployment Insurance Act. Compared with the previous week, when there were 162,795 lodged by males and 122,398 by females, the increase is 39,224. In addition, there were 262,037 policies lodged by short-time workers, 92,539 by males and 169,498 by females, an increase on the previous week of 89,277.The total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 24th December was 662,604. A full analysis of the unemployment position will be found on p. 32.FEATURES OF THE WEEK.General Topics.Relief of Unemployment. The unemployment question was dealt with at a special conference of the Labour Party, held at the Central Hall, Westminster, on the 29th December. A resolution in favour of the principle that work or maintenance should be provided for the unemployed was proposed by Mr. Tom Shaw, M.P., seconded by Mr. Ben Turner and supported by Mr. Robert Williams, and after some discussion was adopted.At a meeting of the Cabinet held on the 31st December proposals emanating from Sir Allan Smith, M.P., chairman of the Managing Committee of the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations, were discussed. The gist of these proposals is that by the adoption of a system of short time the amount of work available should be dis-tributed amongst a greater number of men, and that each industry should be responsible for its own unemployed. It is also reported that a committee composed of employers and employed, is to be set up to investigate these proposals, and a report will be issued very shortly. The Government are also considering the application of these proposals to the Royal Dockyards and other naval establishments.The proposals have roused a good deal of criticism, mostly unfavourable, from employers and workers. The employers hold the view that the scheme can be regarded merely as a palliative, and can only ease the situation where employers have work in hand, but cannot in any way affect the root causes of unemployment. The trade union leaders are more definitely opposed to the scheme, and are of the opinion that it will be impossible to put it into operation to any considerable extent, in view of the amount of short time already being worked in various industries, and also that a reduction of hours and the consequent reduction of wages would lead to a general lowering of the standard of subsistence of the workers. Among the general labour unions also there is objection to the suggestion that each industry should carry its own unemployed. At a meeting of the executive council of the National Federation of General Workers, on the 30th December, a resolution was passed calling on the Government to put into operation the proposals of the Labour Party for the adoption and financing of schemes of work for the relief of the unemployed, or, alternatively, the maintenance of the unemployed and their dependants. A second resolution was also passed, declaring against the suggestion that each separate industry, or branch of industry, should be responsible for its own unemployed, as it was held that insurance, to be effective, must be on the lines of collective risks in respect to industries generally. Otherwise restriction will be placed on the mobility of labour.(b 16822T) C 2
A letter advocating the adoption of the scheme has been issued by the Minister of Labour to all Joint Industrial Councils, Trade Boards, and Interim Industrial Reconstruc-tion Committees, to employers&apos; organisations and to trade unions, pointing out the desir-ability of sharing the existing volume of work among the whole body of the wage-earning classes, and urging co-operation between trade unions and employers in the several trades.The Unemployment Grants Committee, who have  3,000,000 at their disposal, have already approved of a number of schemes, and have granted  27,000, which, with the contributions of the local authorities concerned, is estimated to be sufficient to employ, either on whole-time or half-time, approximately 2,000 men.*Building Guilds.-Statements with regard to the Building Guilds have been recently issued by the National Federation of Building Trades Employers, and by Mr. Stephen Easten, president of the Federation, who lately resigned his position as Honorary Director of Housing Production under the Ministry of Health. Mr. Easten charges the Government with waste, and states, with regard to his resignation, that the official adoption of &quot; the ill-advised, blundering and wasteful scheme of guild subsidies was the last straw.&quot; As his opposition, and that of the Federation, is based, ostensibly, not on hostility to the principle embodied in the guild movement, but on the belief that the trade unions, organised in guilds, are being admitted into the ranks of the employers upon specially favourable terms, the actual terms sanctioned by the Ministry of Health for Guild contracts should perhaps be considered.The clauses in the Form of Contract which relate to the remuneration of the guilds, the chief point dealt with by their critics, provide that all expenses, other than head office expenses, properly incurred by the guilds, shall be repaid to them plus an amount equal to 6 per cent, of these expenses to cover the cost of head office and other charges, and further, a sum of  40 in respect of each house erected under the agreement, provided that in calculating the percentage, no account shall be taken of any additional expenses due to any rise in the cost of materials which may have taken place after the date of tender, and that, if such expenses exceed the estimated cost, the percentage shall be calculated on the estimated and not upon the actual cost.The contract guarantees 5 per cent, profit on each undertaking ; and it may be noted here that, under the constitution of the guilds, any surplus funds must be applied to the improvement of the service and may not on any account be distributed in the form of dividends. The additional  40 per house is destined to provide a fund for continuous pay, without deduction, for time lost, either through wet weather, sickness, or reasonable holidays ; specific arrangement being made that if any scheme of payment for &quot; wet time &quot; is applied to the industry as a whole, the  40 extra remuneration to the guild shall be correspondingly reduced. In this connection, it may be remembered that definite proposals for a guaranteed week have been before the Joint Industrial Council for the Building Industry for some time, and that their rejection has been due entirely to the opposition of the employers, who now complain that they are prohibited by their form of contract from paying their operatives either more or less than the standard trade union rates, while the guilds are relieved from this obligation, and are even assisted to offer better pay than the employers.In the light of the foregoing, the charges brought against the guilds and the replies made in their defence may be summed up as follows : It is maintained that the guilds receive 6 per cent, on account of overhead charges, while the employers only receive ll per cent. To this it is replied that the comparison is misleading, because the employers&apos; contracts provide for the charging of plant separately, while the guilds carry this liability within their 6 per cent.It is alleged that the grant of  40 per house is equivalent to a Government subsidy, and urged in reply that this grant is conditional upon a general adoption of the principle of the guaranteed week, the employers being charged with the responsibility for the failure to introduce it hitherto.The employers consider that guild undertakings, as governed by the existing terms of contract, make for wasteful methods. There is no incentive to save, and no penalty if the estimated cost of the undertaking is exceeded. The guilds reply that all the actual experience is contrary to this, such statistics as are obtainable pointing in the opposite* In this connection it should he pointed out that the sums granted by the committee must not exceed 30 per cent, of the wages bill of additional unemployed men taken on for work on these schemes, and not 30 per cent, of the estimated cost of approved schemes, as erroneously stated in last week&apos;s issue of this Report.
* See this Report, Vol. I, No. 7, 13th March, p. 212.f See this Report, Vol. II, No. 17, 23rd October, p. 482.direction. Moreover, there is no incentive to waste, since the 6 per cent, is calculated on the estimated cost where this is exceeded, and otherwise on the actual cost. It is further maintained that the aim of the guilds is the improvement of the industry and the conditions of those working in it, and that they are not, in respect of ultimate conditions, comparable to undertakings run for private profit.The Ministry of Health have issued a statement in reply to Mr. Fasten, in which they remind the public that the &quot; guild system is an experiment which is being tried on a strictly limited scale, as a means of securing an increased output and reasonable costs, which in many cases have not been secured through building contractors.&quot; It is not possible therefore at present entirely to approve or condemn it.Cotton Control Board. The Court of Chancery have now approved a deed which constitutes a trust to use and apply the surplus funds, amounting to about  1,500,000, standing in the name of this Board.* The original object of the Board was to regulate the industry so as to secure the minimum dislocation from shortage and irregularity of supplies of raw material arising out of the war. Under the Raw Cotton Order, 1917, and the Cotton Restriction of Output Order 1918, only a certain percentage of the spindles and looms of each firm could be worked. Where this number was exceeded under licence from the Board, a levy for each additional spindle or loom worked was imposed. Out of the fund thus accumulated, the operatives who were partially or wholly unemployed were paid an allowance, and the  1,500,000 referred to above represents the unexpended balance of the fund.Under the Trust Deed, the balance may now be applied to the following purposes : Granting war disablement pensions to operatives or former operatives ;Assisting the relatives or dependants of operatives who lost their lives in the war, or have beenfatally injured during their employment in the cotton industry ; Assisting in the education of the children and relatives of cotton operatives ; Making grants for scientific or educational research in the cotton trade ; Developing Empire cotton, and investigating textile trading conditions in foreign countries ; Dealing with unemployment in the cotton industry.Eight trustees have been appointed. The representatives of the employers are Mr. J. S. Addison, of the Calico Printers&apos; Association; Sir E. Tootal Broadhurst; Mr. F. A. Hargreaves, chairman of the Cotton Spinners and Manufacturers&apos; Association; and Mr. R. H. Jackson, of Messrs. Hoyle &amp; Jackson, Olclham. The Operatives&apos; representatives are Mr. &apos;J. Crinion, J.P., president of the Amalgamated Association of Card and Blowing Room Operatives; Mr. J. Cross, J.P., general secretary of the Amalgamated Weavers&apos; Association; Mr. Edward Duxbury, general secretary of the General Union of Associations of Loom Overlookers; and Mr. Edward Judson, J.P., president of the Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners and Twiners.It is reported that the trustees do not intend to dissipate the capital sum, but all grants will be made from interest. It will be observed that grants may be made from the fund, inter alia, for the relief of unemployment in the cotton industry, and, at a meeting of the Board in Manchester on the 29th December, a sub-committee was appointed to consider the state of unemployment in the industry. A report will be presented to a full meeting of the Board at an early date, when it is expected that con-sideration will be given to the question of devoting a portion of the Board&apos;s funds to relieving cases of distress arising out of the present serious unemployment.The Board will in future be known as the Cotton Reconstruction Board, and Mr. J. S. Addison has been elected chairman in succession to the late Sir A. Herbert Dixon.Board of Education ; Salaries of Elementary School Teachers.-With reference to the report issued by the Standing Joint Committee on the scales of salaries for teachers in public elementary schools,f it now appears that there is some doubt as1 to whether the recommendations of this report are to be adopted. On the 24th December, the President of the Board of Education sent to Viscount Burnham, the chairman of the Joint Com-mittee, a letter in which he states that in view of &quot; the grave anxiety as to the financial position of the country,&quot; and &quot;as it will not be possible to estimate for some time to come, even, provisionally, the cost to all the local authorities, in the aggregate, of the adoption of standard scales, nor the cost to the Exchequer,&quot; he finds it impossible to sanction the increased expenditure which would be incurred by the adoption of the
Committee&apos;s proposals, without some further consideration by the Board. He also states that it would be impossible, without further consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to recognise, for the calculation of increased salaries, expenditure incurred by local authorities, as from a date so early as the 1st April, 1921, and that no decision can be given until it is possible to form an idea of the financial effect of the adoption of the recommendations. The President also takes exception to the &quot; bewildering variety of local scales,&quot; and expresses the hope that, on further consideration, there may be a reduc-tion to a reasonable number of standard scales, which would facilitate administration and would aid the consolidation of the teaching service.This letter has given rise to severe criticisms from various teachers&apos; associations, among which that of Mr. F. W. Golclstone, Assistant Secretary of the National Union of Teachers, may be noted. He thinks that there is no question that the money will be found for the payment of the scale suggested for salaries of secondary school teachers, and fears that resentment will be roused amongst teachers in elementary schools by what will be regarded as &quot; preferential treatment.&quot;Labour and Ireland. At a special conference of the Labour Party held on the 29th December in the Central Hall, Westminster, the report of the Labour Joint Commission of Inquiry was considered. The report deals with the Commission&apos;s investigations into the present regime in Ireland, and the alleged complicity of the Government in reprisals ; and also contains an account of the efforts made by Mr. Henderson and Mr. Adamson to establish a truce as a first step to securing peace with Ireland.Resolutions were passed by the conference demanding an immediate judicial inquiry into the question of reprisals, challenging the Government to disprove the statements of the Labour Commission by such an inquiry, and outlining the Labour Party&apos;s policy with regard to Ireland, which has been approved by the Irish Labour Party and Trades Union Congress. It was announced that a great national campaign is to be organised by the Labour Party to advocate their policy &quot; of an early and honourable settlement of the Irish question,&quot; and to demand the immediate cessation of all acts of violence. The campaign will be inaugurated by a meeting to be held on the 17th January in the Free Trade Hall, Manchester, and will be followed by meetings in all parts of the country. Following the decision of the Irish raihvaymen, on the 21st December, work has been generally resumed on the Irish railways. The boilermakers of two of the railway com-panies, who have been on strike for some months, have not, however, yet returned to work, and a complete resumption will not be possible until this dispute is settled.Control of Industry.Raikvays. The executive committee of the National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers have issued a report on the proposals of the Minister of Transport for the future organisation of the transport undertakings in Great Britain and their relation to the State, as outlined in the White Paper Cmd. 787.* Part of the report is devoted to considerations connected with labour, and is, therefore, worth mention.The federation are of opinion that, in the best interest of the community, the railways should, as soon as possible, revert to the pre-war system of ownership and management, subject only to such Parliamentary control as existed before the war. As regards manage-ment, they are strongly in favour of advisory committees and conciliation boards, on which there should be labour representation, for the consideration and settlement of wages and conditions of employment, but they are strongly opposed to the scheme, suggested by the Ministry of Transport, of appointing workers on the board of management of the railways. &quot; They regard it as a fundamental basis of all commercial concerns that those who provide the capital and take the risks should elect the management. They believe that any other course would seriously affect the possibility of obtaining the necessary capital for clevlop-ment, and would lead to unsatisfactory management.&quot;On the question of wages and working conditions, the federation agree that the provision of satisfactory permanent machinery &quot; is advisable to prevent, as far as possible, friction between employers and employed and stoppage of work,&quot; but that this machinery must not be such as will prevent the operation of economic laws, by using the monopoly of the railway companies to secure for railway workers exceptional wages or unreasonable conditions. Moreover, they believe that on many railways the present system &quot; results in enormous increase of cost by reason of the payment of wages, and the maintenance of conditions, far beyond what is reasonable or necessary.&quot;
Finally, with regard to the future powers of the State in relation to railways, Parlia-mentary control&quot; should be limited to dealing with such matters as are necessary to prevent unfair use of the practical monopoly which is conferred upon them by the special privileges granted to them by Parliament, so as to prevent those privileges being used to the detriment of national interests.&quot;Industrial and Other Organisations.National Federation of Building Trades Operatives. The Emergency Committee of this body met in London on the 29th December, to discuss the Governments proposals for the absorption of unemployed ex-Service men in the building industry, and to draft a statement on the situation for the full meeting of the executives of the affiliated unions which was held at the Kingsway Hall on the following day. The proceedings of both meetings were private, but upon the termination of the meeting of the executives, a letter was sent to the Minister of Labour. This letter regretted that the Government proposals contain no guarantee against unemployment, and that only those sections of the industry which are to be diluted will be entitled to &quot; wet time &quot; allowance. It also stated that the proposals had been referred to the separate unions of the Federation for consideration; and they would communicate their views to the central body at the earliest possible date, when a further meeting of the executives would be held and a policy declared. The Minister replied to this communication with a request for a definite decision by the 14th January at the latest, but the Federation state that, although they will do their utmost to expedite matters, it is probable that a decision will not be arrived at before the end of the month.National Federation of Law Clerks. As a result of the meeting, held on the 25th November; of the Law Society and delegates from the associated Provincial Law Societies to consider the proposals put forward by the Federation of Law Clerks for the grading of clerics and the fixing of minimum scales of salary for the various grades, the Council of the Law Society have passed a resolution recommending Provincial Law Societies to form Joint Councils, when requested to do so by a representative body of clerks in their districts, but stating that, in the opinion of the Council, the duty of a Joint Council should be, for the present, to aim at remedying hardship in individual cases, without attempting to lay down rules of general application. As this resolution implies the rejection of the programme of the Federation, the London Law Clerks&apos; Union have withdrawn from the London Joint Council, and it is expected that the Provincial Law Clerks&apos; Association will take similar action in the case of the Provincial J oint Councils. The secretary of the National Federa-tion of Law Clerks has written to the Minister setting forth the history of the negotiations leading up to the present deadlock.Trade Union Topics.Trade Union Amalgamations. The following new unions, most of which have already been referred to at greater length in previous issues, came into existence on the 1st January : The Amalgamated Union of Allied Building Trade Workers, being an amalgamation of the Operative Bricklayers&apos; Society, the Manchester Unity of Operative Bricklayers Trade, Accident, Sick and Burial Society, and the Operative Society of Stonemasons, Quarrymen and Allied Trades of England and Wales.*The National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers, an amalgamation of the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative and Commercial Employees and Allied Workers and the National Warehouse and General Workers&apos; Union.The Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers, an amalgamation of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners and the General Union of Operative Carpenters and Joiners.The National Union of Printing, Bookbinding, Machine Biding and Paper Workers, an amalgama-tion of the National Union of Printing and Paper Workers, and the National Union of Bookbinders and Machine Rulers.The National Woolsorlcrs&apos; Society, an amalgamation of the National Union of Woolsorters and the Bradford Woolsorters&apos; Society.There is strong evidence that thetendency towards amalgamation will operate in 1921 as strongly as in the past year. Much prominence has recently been given to the move-ment for the amalgamation of 19 of the unions affiliated to the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, which is now being pressed forward very vigorously, and the amalgamation* Owing to difficulties in connection with the registration of the new rules, the formal ratification of this amalgamation may be delayed for a few mouths.
NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Building Trades Ojjeratives (Scotland). In October last the Building Trades of Scotland Operatives&apos; Wages and Conditions of Service Board made a claim for an advance of 4c . an hour in the rates of wages paid to craftsmen and labourers throughout Scotland, with effect from the 1st December, 1920. This demand was considered by the Scottish National Building Trades Federation (Employers), and the Scottish Building Contractors&apos; Associa-tion. Representatives of these organisations discussed the question in London with the National Federation of Building Trades Employers. They also met representatives of the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation to consider the relation of the demand to the rates paid to joiners engaged on shipbuilding. Several unavailing joint conferences have been held, the employers&apos; associations maintaining the attitude that further advances in building trade rates of wages in Scotland cannot be justified on the ground of increased cost of living, and would render the building industry economically unsound. At the last joint conference which was held at Glasgow on the 20th December, it was decided that repre-sentatives of both employers and operatives should consult further with their respective organisations. In connection with the co-operation noted in this paragraph between the Scottish building trades employers and the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation, the building trades employers undertook not to employ any of the shipyard joiners at present on strike.* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 22, 27th November, p. 605, and No. 23, 4th December, p. 631. f - See this Report.. Vol. II, No. 25, 18th December, 1920, p. 680.of the Workers&apos; Union, the Municipal Employees&apos; Association, the National Amalgamated Union of Labour, the National Union of General Workers and the National Federation of Women Workers in one large union is now being discussed.Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain. Further attacks on the constitution of this Federation, and on that of the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association, were made at a conference called by the &quot; Doncaster Workers&apos; Committee,&quot; which consists of miners holding advanced views, held at Mexborough on the 1st January. The conference declared that both these unions were &quot; obsolete,&quot; and a resolution was passed calling upon the Yorkshire miners to work, in conjunction with the Scottish and Welsh miners * in revising the rules of the organisation, and transforming it into an industrial union &quot; based entirely on the class struggle.&quot; A manifesto was drawn up, and a scheme for the establishment of a National Union of Mine Workers, built on the principle of shop stewards&apos; committees, was discussed. Communal ownership of mines and all other industries, with full and complete control by the workers, was laid down as a policy ; and a resolution was passed urging affiliation with the Third (Moscow) International.In view, however, of the recent delegate meeting of the council of the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association^ when a resolution demanding the resignation of Messrs. H. Smith, Potts and Roebuck, was defeated by 2,667 votes to 46, it would not appear that the resolutions passed at this Conference represent the views of more than a small minority of the Yorkshire miners.International Relations of Labour.International Labour Office. The sixth session of the Governing Body of the Inter-national Labour Office will be held on the 11th January, 1921. The agenda consists of the following items : (1) Approval of the minutes of the fifth session; (2) the Report of the Director; (3) the 1921 Budget; (4) preparation of the 1921 Conference; (5) action required by the decisions of the Joint Maritime Commission; (6) the Report of the Com-mittee on Standing Orders, regarding the reform of the composition of the Governing Body ; (7) scrutiny of the appointments made under Article 412 (Commissions of Inquiry); (8) the Report of the Commission on Unemployment; (9) proposals put forward by Mr. Oudegeest as to the relations between the International Labour Organisation and the League of Nations, and as to the Standing Orders of the Conference (Committee of Selection); (10) date of the next session.
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.Strikes and Lock-Outs.RaUway Shopmen (Great Northern Railway Company). It is reported that the executive of the National Union of Railwaymen have decided to give support to the strike of the members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union employed in the running sheds and workshops on the Great Northern Railway, and have instructed their members not to perform &quot; blackleg &quot; work. It is understood that the Negotiating Committee of General Managers have this dispute in hand.Settlements and Agreements.Coal Miners (National). In accordance with the terms of the agreement under which the coal strike was settled* the unconditional advances of wages by 26&apos;. a shift to persons, 18 years of age and over, Is. to persons of 16 and 17, and Qd. to persons under 16, terminated on the 1st January, and the miners&apos; wages for the four weeks from the 3rd January have now to be adjusted on the basis of output, for the five weeks test period ending the 18th December. The total output for this period was 26,075,800 tons, giving a weekly average of 5,215,160 tons, which, alter making allowance for annual holidays, is regarded as equivalent to a yearly rate of 260,758,000 tons. This entitles colliery workers to advances in wages over pre-strike rates, for the period from the 3rd to the 31st January, of 3s. Qd. per shift to persons of 18 years and over, Is. 9d. to those of 16 and 17 years, and Is. 3%d. to those under 16 years of age. Adult miners will therefore obtain through January an addition of Is. Gd. a day to present earnings.Coal Miners (South Wales). The negotiations between the executive of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation and the Ocean Coal Co. resulted in a settlement on the 3rd January, the company undertaking to provide the discharged men with employment at certain other pits. With a view to obviating similar disputes, the meeting of the South Wales Coal Conciliation Board, on the 3rd January, decided to appoint a joint committee to investigate individual cases affected by the closing of working places declared to be unprofitable.Colliery Enginemen (Scotland). A special delegate meeting of the Scottish Collieiy Engine and Boilermen&apos;s Association, held in Glasgow on the 27th December, decided to accept the offer of the Scottish coalowners of an increase of Is. Sd. a shift to winding enginemen as from the 1st December.Coopers (Scottish Fish Curing Trade). In connection with this dispute, noted last week, a new agreement has now been arrived at, renewing the terms of the old agreement of the 26th December, 1919, but withdrawing the advances granted last July.Gold, Silver and Allied Trades (National). In consequence of the depressed state of the trade, the National Union of Gold, Silver and Allied Trades have accepted the proposals of the Manufacturing Silversmiths&apos; Association for a reduction in minimum rates of wages. The agreement provides that time-workers shall receive 2s. Id. an hour as against 2s. 5d. under the old agreement, while the cost-of-living index number remains between 125 and 185 per cent, above the pre-war figure. Piece-workers are to receive 130 per cent, over the 1914 figures as compared with 142 per cent, under the old agreement. If the cost-of-living index number shows a fall below 125 per cent, or a rise above 185 per cent., time-rates are to fall or rise Id. per hour respectively.-[Other disputes, negotiations, and settlements are referred to in the Industrial Relations Department section of the Report, pages 28 to 31.]D(B 16822T)
PART II-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DEPARTMENT.ENGINEERING, SHIPBUILDING AND ALLIED TRADES.Iron and Steel Wire Manufacturing. The Joint Industrial Council met in Manchester on the 16th December. The question was raised of forming two separate panels within the Council, for dealing with skilled workers and ancillary workers. The proposal found favour with both sides, but a decision was postponed to the next meeting.It was decided to refer the questions of extra pay for night work, and overtime, to District Committees for investigation and report. Although the District Committees have been decided upon, none have yet been set up. Steps are to be taken, however, to form the committees as soon as possible.The meeting discussed schemes for contracting out of the Unemployment Insurance Act. The chairman complained that employers&apos; associations were in a difficult position, as they had no definite idea as to the exact policy of the Ministry of Labour on the question of contracting out. The Council decided to request the department to draw up a model scheme, and submit it to all industries, so that each industry could make the necessary modifications to suit its own peculiarities. The final scheme for each industry then could be submitted to the department for sanction. The action of the department in demanding that only complete schemes should be submitted was very severely criticised by both sides. It was pointed out that the official memorandum on the subject, U.I.A.2, gave practically no information. An employer stated that he had received an explanation of the scheme which the hosiery trade had produced. He suggested that if the Ministry were to accept some scheme on these lines and circulate it to all industries, much good might result.Laminated Spring Trade : Dissatisfaction with Industrial Court Award. At a recent mass meeting of members of the Associated Blacksmiths and Ironworkers&apos; Society engaged in the laminated spring making industry, it was resolved not to accept the decision of the Industrial Court in Award No. 569 on the first item of the terms of reference, namely, that &quot; the printed spring smiths&apos; price list for heavy laminated springs is not a true record of the agreement come to in conference with reference to thick end hoops.&quot;At the hearing before the Court, it was stated on behalf of the union that the representatives attending the conference had no authority to bind the union to the price for any particular item, and that each item agreed at the conference required the approval of the spring smiths and strikers concerned. On the price list, as settled in conference, being submitted by the union representatives, the men disapproved the item &quot; thick end hoops (engine) &quot; so far as it contained the words &quot; of varying thickness.&quot; Subsequently the list, so amended, was submitted by the union to the secretary of the employers&apos; com-mittee for signature. He signed it under a misapprehension as to the effect of the amend-ment, but had no authority from the employers to sign the list as amended. The Court, therefore, found that the printed price list was not a true record, owing&quot; to the omission of these words, and that no final settlement of the price list was reached at the conference.The Chief Conciliation Officer, Sheffield, reports that the parties expected that the Court would fix rates for thick end hoops in the event of a decision that the list was not a true record of the agreement. The matter has been discussed between representatives of the Laminated Spring Manufacturers&apos; Association and the Associated Blacksmiths and Ironworkers&apos; Society, and a conference has been arranged at which it is expected that agreement will be reached as to the rates in question.FOOD AND DRINK.Scottish BaJcers.-Tke Scottish Union of Bakers and Confectioners issued instructions to all branches to accept an advance of 7s. Qd. per week, and to cease work on the 25th December only in the event of this advance being refused by the employers. Settlements on this basis have been effected in the majority of localities.  In other districts the
(b 16822.t)operatives have agreed to accept a 5s. advance. The advances are conditional in some cases on the increase in the cost of living remaining above the figure reached on the 1st, June. Strikes have occurred at Hawick, Dumfries, Fraserburgh, Kirriemuir, Girvan and Stranraer. At Banchory a settlement has been reached but no increase has been granted. At Ayr the individual employers are negotiating separately and in some cases the operatives are continuing to work on their old rates.Fishing Industry (Grimsby). The union representatives were seen by the Chief Labour Adviser on the 24th December, when he promised to ask the owners to meet him at an early date. A meeting with the trawler owners was accordingly arranged for the 3rd January.Canal Boatmen, (Weaver). The Chemical Employers&apos; Federation have reported a difficulty which the Salt Union, Ltd., have with their boatmen, members of the Weaver Watermen&apos;s Association. It appears that, owing to intense depression in the salt trade, it has been found necessary to work short time. The firm gave instructions to tie up 25 per cent, of their fleet for two weeks at a time, in order that the watermen might share equally in the work. These instructions were apparently given without consulting the men or their representatives, and they have replied by refusing to work overtime. Owing to the difficulties of the Liverpool tides it is impossible to carry on without a certain amount of night work.A joint conference, under the chairmanship of the Chief Conciliation Officer, was held on the 23rd December, when a resolution was adopted by both sides that the men&apos;s repre-sentatives recommend their association to withdraw the overtime embargo on condition that the employers re-open the wages negotiations immediately, and that the firm re-employ all men in full at the earliest possible moment. A meeting of the men on the 27th December accepted the recommendation, and the overtime embargo has been withdrawn.TEXTILES.Dyers and Bleachers (Lancashire and Yorkshire). Following on the conference between representatives of the employers and operatives in the dyeing and bleaching industry and Sir David Shackleton* a joint meeting of the executive committees of the eleven trade unions concerned was held on the 24th December. The suggested proposals were discussed, and it was decided to proceed with arbitration upon the lines suggested by Sir David Shackleton.  The court of arbitration is now being arranged.IRON AND STEEL.Bricklayers and Bricklayers&apos;  labourers in Iron and Steel Works (North-East Coast).  On a claim for an advance of 4d. per hour, with retrospective effect as from the 13th November, the Industrial Court, taking into account the weekly earnings and other con-siderations, decided that the claim had not been established.   (Award No. 580.)PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND PUBLIC UTILITY SERVICES.County Council Employees (London). A claim was made for an increase to men employed under the Main Drainage, Highways, Fire Brigade, and Asylums Committees. The Court awarded to able-bodied men, aged 18 years and over, not in receipt of the 12^ per cent, bonus on earnings, an advance of 4s. 6d. a week, payable at the rate of Qd. a day or shift, and to able-bodied men, aged 21 years and over, in receipt of the 12^ per cent, bonus, an advance of 4s. a week, payable at the rate of Sd. a day or shift.  (Award No. 582.)Electricity Supply. A special meeting of the District Council for the East Coast Area was held on the.29th December. At a meeting on the 16th December the employers&apos; representatives had agreed to consult their constituent undertakings as to whether they would agree to the proposal of the trade union side that the schedule of basic rates and conditions should be referred for arbitration. The two sides of the Council had previously failed to agree upon this schedule, which had then been referred to and endorsed by the National Council, and afterwards rejected by the employers&apos; representatives on the District Council. The trade unions concerned had meanwhile circulated a communication to the undertakings in the area, to the effect that, the employers having failed to accept the schedule approved by the National Council, their original and larger claim must now be pressed, namely, for a schedule which should be 3s. per week higher all round than that
adopted by the Home Counties District Council on the 1st May. It was agreed on the 29th December that this claim be referred to the Industrial Court for arbitration, the consent of the undertakings concerned having been given, with the exceptions of Peter-borough, King&apos;s Lynn and Cambridge, which were in favour of arbitration upon the schedule endorsed by the National Council. It was decided that deputations from the Council should visit these three undertakings, with a view to securing their acceptance of the proposal to go to arbitration upon the larger trade union claim. It was further agreed that the proceedings of the meeting be reported to the National Council, for formal endorsement, before arbitration.Following on the conference of representatives of the Hackney,Hornsey,Finchley and Ilford undertakings and of the Electrical Power Engineers&apos; Association, held on the 20th December, at which the association agreed to suspend further any action with respect to these under-takings for ten days to enable the respective councils to agree to adopt the schedule and conditions recommended by the National Joint Board, subject to any anomalies and difficulties of interpretation being referred for adjustment to the District Joint Board which is to be set up for the Greater London Area, the Hackney, Hornsey and Finchley Councils have adopted resolutions whioh are considered to be satisfactory by the association. The resolution adopted by the Ilford Council was regarded as unsatisfactory, and the association threatened to withdraw their members on the 31st December ; but, following upon conferences between Sir David Shackleton and the parties separately on the 31st December, the association agreed to a further suspension of their notices, and the repre-sentatives of the council undertook that the unsatisfactory resolution should be considered by the special committee appointed by the council.GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.Admiralty. A special meeting of the Industrial Council was held on the 29th and 30th December, to consider a Cabinet decision that short time should be worked in the Royal Dockyards and Admiralty industrial establishments.An Admiralty statement was submitted, proposing a reduction of 10 hours a week, the money thus saved being used for the purpose of stopping further discharges and of absorbing a proportion of the unemployed. The trade union side refused to accept any responsibility for the short-time proposals, on the ground that the decision of the Cabinet had been reached without previous consultation with the Council. As a result of the attitude of the trade union side, the Minister of Labour visited the Council, when the trade union side put forward the following counter-proposals : Extension of re-payment services in Royal Dockyards and Naval Establishments to provide employment without further burdening the taxpayer.The Government to bear 50 per cent, of the cost of the wages reduction occasioned by the short time.Dr. Macnamara enumerated the Governments measures for alleviating the problem of unemployment, pointed out that short time was already in operation in many important industries, and said that he could not accept the counter-proposals. He relied upon the goodwill of the workers in the dockyards to come to the assistance of the unemployed.The trade union side subsequently decided that they would put the onus of accepting or rejecting the proposed short time on the yard committees, and, for the purpose of ascertaining the opinion of the yards, asked for the adjournment of the Council to the 11th January. The Admiralty replied that, as the principle of short time was a Cabinet decision, an adjournment could not be granted to consider whether or not it should be introduced, and it was proposed therefore to issue a warning notice on the 3rd January that it would come into operation on the 17th January. The Admiralty would be pre-pared, however, to grant the adjournment in order that the trade union side might have the opportunity of consulting the yard committees as to the best methods of applying the principle.The trade union side then announced that under these circumstances the unions had decided to withdraw from the Council and from all the joint machinery set up in connection with Government industrial establishments, including the Trade Joint Councils, as a protest against the imposition of a Cabinet decision, on a question of working conditions, without previous consultation with the Council, or the use of any other form of negotiation. This, it was claimed, was contrary to the ordinary practice of industrial negotiation, and to the principle of &quot; Whitleyism,&quot; to which it was understood the Government were committed.
GENERAL DEPARTMENT.TRADE BOARDS.PROCEEDINGS.Conference of Metal Trade Boards. Representatives nominated from the Stamped or Pressed Metal Wares Trade Board (Great Britain), the Button-Making Trade Board (Great Britain), the Pin, Hook and Eye, and Snap Fastener Trade Board (Great Britain), and the Coffin Furniture and Cerement-Making Trade Board (Great Britain) met to consider whether these Boards should be fused into one Board, but no agreement was reached.Chain Trade Board (Great Britain).-Th.Q Board resolved to continue after the 31st March, 1921, the present rates in operation, subject to slight variation in the general mini-mum piece-rates. It was decided to point out the need for general inspection in the women&apos;s section of the trade and in the common section of the men&apos;s work.Fur Trade Board (Great Britain). The Administrative Committee agreed to inform the Minister that in cases where the committee had granted permits of exemption for short periods, there had always been special reasons for doing so.In view of the attitude of the trade union side the Admiralty finally decided, on their own responsibility, to adjourn the Council until the 11th January, and to take no action on the short-time proposals in the meanwhile.Women Employees (Royal Naval Dockyards and Admiralty Establishments). The Industrial Court considered that the claim for a flat rate of 52s. a week to the women concerned was not advisable, as they comprise workers of varying degrees of skill, at several rates of pay, performing work of a widely different nature, and with duties which vary considerably. An advance is awarded of 3s. a week to women time-workers, of 18 years and over, and an equivalent increase to piece-workers, irrespective of age. (Award No. 585.)MISCELLANEOUS TRADES.Co-operative Workers. With reference to the claim made by the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative and Commercial Employees and Allied Workers against the Southern District of the Co-operative Union, Ltd., the Chief Conciliation Officer has arranged to be present at a meeting of the Board of the Co-operative Union oh the 6th January, and expects that he may be able to arrange for a further joint conference between the parties. It is thought that the withdrawal of labour will be postponed.Temporary Postmen (Glasgow). About 400 Glasgow temporary postmen threatened to strike on the 18th December for a minimum weekly wage of  4. The local Deputy Postmaster-General, after consultation with the Chief Conciliation Officer, met the men again, and they decided to continue at work. It is understood that the settlement gives the men a flat rate of Is. %d. per hour for a 48-hour week, making 72s., which, with the addition of extras, such as overtime, will easily bring the wage up to the minimum demanded.GENERAL.a Restoration of Pre-War Practices ; Question of Time Limit. The boilermakers&apos; society brought an action, under the Restoration of Pre-War Practices Act, against Messrs. Ramage and Ferguson, Ltd., Leith, to compel the firm to employ journeymen instead of apprentices on oxy-acetylene welding. The case was heard by the Edinburgh Local Munitions Tribunal on the 5th November, when the tribunal dismissed the action. The chairman expressed the opinion that an action for the restoration of a practice, brought after the 15th October, must fail, but one brought solely for the purpose of the imposition of a penalty might hold good.   There has been no appeal.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Industrial Relations will be found also on pages 20 to 27, 31 and 32.]
FIXING AND VARIATION OF MINIMUM RATES OF WAGES.Linen and Cotton Handkerchief and Household Goods and Linen Piece Goods Trade Board (I.reland).-The Board have issued a Notice of Proposal, dated the 1st January, to fix general minimum time-rates for male workers, and overtime rates for male and female workers.The general minimum time-rates per hour proposed for male workers employed in the lapping and other sections of the trade, excluding workers on Swiss embroidery, are Is. Id. for lappers who have served 5 years&apos; apprenticeship ; Is. 1\d. for measurers and sample makers who have served 5 years&apos; apprenticeship ; and Is. tyd. for other workers, 21 years of age and over, with lower rates for younger workers. For male workers on Swiss embroidery machines, the rates are from Is. id. to Is. Qd. per hour. The above rates are not to apply, during their period of training, to workers who are employed under a training scheme laid down by the Ministry for the Swiss embroidery branch of the trade.The overtime rates proposed for male and female time-workers are, for overtime on any day other than Sunday and customary or statutory holidays, time-and-a-half; for all time worked on Sunday and customary or statutory holidays, double-time ; for all hours worked in any week in excess of 47, time-and-a-half, except in so far as higher rates are payable.The overtime rates proposed for male and female piece-workers, to correspond with the rates of time-and-a-half, and double-time proposed for time-workers, are one quarter and the whole, respectively of the appropriate general minimum time-rate in the case of male workers, or of the appropriate piece-work basis time-rate in the case of female workers, in addition to piece-rates which would yield, in the circumstances of the case, to an ordinary worker, not less than the appropriate general minimum time-rate in the case of male workers, or the appropriate piece-work basis time-rate in the case of female workers.For the purpose of these overtime rates the Board have declared the normal number of hours of work to be 47 in any week ; 8  on any week-day other than Saturday ; and i\ on Saturday.Tobacco Trade Board (Ireland). The Board have issued a Notice of Proposal, dated the 1st January, to vary the general minimum time-rates and overtime rates for male and female workers. &amp;The general minimum time-rates proposed, for a week of 47 hours, are 55s. 6d. for male and 34s. for female workers, 21 years of age and upwards, with lower rates for younger workers.The overtime rates as varied are calculated on the above minimum rates, for hours worked in excess of the declared normal number of hours of work, in the same manner as the overtime rates at present in operation.EMPLOYMENT AND INSURANCE DEPARTMENT.EMPLOYMENT EXCHANGES.The Unemployment Position.The following table shows the work of the Exchanges in respect of registrations, vacancies, and placings during the week ending the 24th December: Registrations  On live register at beginning of weekFresh applications.........On live register at end of week   ...Vacancies  Carried forward at beginning of weekFresh notifications.........Carried forward at end of week   ...Placings...............Men.

Employment and Insurance Department-continued.Metis Employment.General Outlook. Reports indicate that unemployment is rapidly increasing and that in consequence of the prolonged stoppage for holidays, considerable apprehension is felt as to the immediate future.Local Reports. The Divisional Controller of the North-Western Division reports that it is difficult to describe adequately the serious extent of unemployment and short-time working which now exists, and the enormous task which the staff in this division are called upon to face in. dealing with the mass of claims to insurance benefit. The unemployment position can only be described as deplorable and, unfortunately, none of the districts appear to hold out any hopes of an early revival. The impression prevalent is that there is little hope of any real improvement for two or three months yet, and that a revival is largely -dependent on a recovery in the general financial position. This statement, which mainly reflects the position in the cotton industry, may also be said to describe accurately the position in regard to the wool, lace, hosiery, boot and shoe, and motor industries.The outlook in the iron and steel and tinplate trades is also distinctly unfavourable. Sheffield report that, while there has not been a large number of men on the register during the week, it is expected that, owing to slackness in trade, short-time working will be largely resorted to after the holidays. In the South Wales district, large numbers of employees in the tinplate works have already been dismissed for an indefinite period, and there are approximately 15,000 workpeople under notice to terminate their engagements. In the London area, unemployment in the engineering, furniture, leather, clothing, transport and motor trades is still acute, and there is no prospect of any improvement in the immediate future.It is reported from the Clyde that employment in the skilled sections of shipbuilding is fairly good, and that one of the largest firms in the Govan district have intimated during the week that they have a large amount of work on hand. little change is reported from Tyneside, and the increase in registrations in this district is largely due to the fact that most firms have closed down for 10 days during the holiday period. The position on the Wear is stated to be steadily growing worse, and the immediate prospects are indicative of a slump. General slackness is reported on Tees-side, although at Hartlepool the position has to some extent improved, as the result of better deliveries of material. On the Mersey, Garston report that the ship-repairing industry is very steady, but is slow in absorbing the skilled labour which has been idle since the shipwrights&apos; dispute. At Birkenhead and Bootle, repair work at the dry docks consists of small jobs of a more or less casual nature, and contracts for repairs and refitting are being diverted from both these places to the Continent. In the South Wales district the ship-repairing industry at Bute Docks, Barry, Newport and Swansea has slightly improved.Labour Reductions. In addition to discharges reported above Messrs. Kynoch, Ltd., Kynochstown, Grays, are reported to be closing down entirely, early in the New Year. At Braintree, Messrs. Lake, Elliott and Co., manufacturers of motor accessories, have dis-charged some 50 unskilled workers. Messrs. Clement-Talbot, Ltd., North Kensington, have discharged 350 men owing to slackness of trade, and heavy dismissals by Messrs. Vickers, Ltd., Crayford, are reported.In the Flint area two lead-mining firms have closed down indefinitely, and, at Gorseinon 850 workpeople are affected by the closing down of the Bryngwyn sheet mills. The Margam Copper Works, Port Talbot, have suspended operations for an indefinite period, and 250 workers have been thrown out of employment. Discharges affecting some 4,000 workpeople are reported from Llanelly owing to the closing down of tinplate and steel works.Shortage of Labour. Skilled operatives in the building trade are still in demand both in London and the provinces. Other types of labour for which there is a scarcity are iron and steel moulders, chemical plumbers, wagon repairers and coach builders.Transport. At all the South Wales ports, the position in regard to transport workers is fairly good and shows a slight improvement over the previous week; but at Hull the daily surplus of transport labour is still abnormal, although the prospects for coal trimmers appear to be brighter, as the embargo on exportation of coal is expected to be removed shortly. At Grimsby, work on the goods side of the docks is still very quiet, and apparently little improvement can be looked for before the spring, when it is expected that the timber trade will show a revival.
Employment and Insurance Department-continued.Women&apos;s Employment.General Situation. Reports received are somewhat incomplete owing to the holidays, but do not reveal much change in the situation. In the great industrial centres under-employment and unemployment continue to increase, and generally extended Christmas holidays are taking place.Local Reports. The Yorkshire and East Midlands Division again emphasise the grow-ing depression in the textile and other staple industries, as well as the ancillary and distri-butive trades. The General Union of Textile Workers state that in the Bradford district alone some 35,000 of their members are on short time. In the wholesale clothing trade the depression is acute ; of the 6,816 women on the Leeds live register over 5,000 are skilled machinists. Two clothing factories at Castleford have closed down entirely, and there is little hope of any revival before the early spring. In Hebden Bridge practically every mill is on short time. The position in the lace trade is thought to be worse than in any other . staple industry; the majority of the operatives are suspended, and those on short time are only working one or two clays a week. In Long Eaton distress is reported, and few manufacturers are optimistic even about a trade revival in the spring. In the hosiery, leather and making up trades unemployment is on the increase.From the South Midlands and Eastern Division, depressing reports continue to be received in regard to the clothing, hosiery, corset, boot and shoe, and food trades. The live registers for the division show an increase of 1,421 during the week ending the 23rd December. The largest increases are shown at Leicester and Norwich, with 1,095 and 199, respectively.Increasing unemployment in the engineering and rubber industries is reported by the West Midlands Divisions. The live register at Coventry is 2,100 ; 20 firms are on short time, including many engaged in engineering and motor work, and the Dunlop Rubber Co., Ltd. At Burslem it is stated that a number of pottery manufacturers are closing down for two or three weeks, and the Longton Exchange state that employment in the industry has fallen off to some extent. Kidderminster report that the carpet trade remains good, but that owing to cancellation of orders, a slump is. expected in the New Year.Serious unemployment continues to be reported from London. At Bermondsey, jam workers, tin box makers, leather workers and tailoresses are unemployed. The live register is 1,883. Messrs. Peek, Frean &amp; Co., Ltd., biscuit manufacturers, are considerng closing for three days each week. This will affect some 3,000 workers, the majority women and girls. Shoreditch report a live register of 1,466. Woolwich state that applicants cease to register after benefit is exhausted, and this is no doubt very generally the case.The South-Western Division report increased depression in the clothing industries, Eastville (Bristol) report 700 women confectionery workers on short time with Messrs. H. S. Packer &amp; Co., Ltd., and 400 current claims from employees of other firms, including Messrs. W. D. &amp; H. O. Wills, Ltd., tobacco manufacturers, and various corset manu-facturers. At Yeovil all glove factories are closing for a week, and it is feared trade in this industry will be bad in the New Year.From Scotland increasing short time and extended Christmas holidays are reported in the staple industries. At Dunfermline four linen firms are commencing short time affecting approximately 15,000 workers. The Glasgow Exchanges report high live registers. The Aberdeen Exchange report 1,900 women claiming unemployment insurance, of whom 1,300 are on short time. At Dundee most firms in the jute industry are taking extended holidays until the 10th or 11th January.Reports from the remaining divisions are not yet to hand.Domestic Service. In contrast with the serious industrial depression, domestic service still presents enormous unsatisfied demands for resident workers. For the four weeks ending the 10th December, the average weekly number registered for resident hotel domestic work was 809 ; the average number of live vacancies, 1,145 ; and of placings, 182. For private resident domestics the corresponding numbers were 2,584, 13,116 and 476. For non-resident domestics, the figures were 7,747,1,428 and 798 ; and for charwomen, 11,783, 1,145 and 1,423.These figures clearly illustrate the discrepancy between supply and demand, the over-whelming demand being for resident private domestics, while a very large proportion of the supply is for daily domestic work. The greater number of these applicants are char-women, who for the most part are married, and are of limited availability and training. Many on the register for residential service are also untrained, elderly, or with children.
Employment and Insurance Department-continued.Difficulty is frequently experienced in persuading employers to accept inexperienced workers.Seasonal Service. Reports from the divisions, in regard to the work undertaken during the year in connection with the supply of seasonal domestic workers to holiday resorts,* are now complete. A total of approximately 4,000 vacancies were filled, a satis-factory result which was felt to be due to the preliminary preparation and organisation which took place in connection with this work.The arrangements in Scotland included a special section attached to the Glasgow Exchange for this purpose, and the Exchange was empowered by a large number of employers to engage staff direct throughout the season on their behalf. This arrangement was a great advantage to employers in outlying areas. In the Inverness area, close co-operation was established with the Branch Offices, resulting in the placing of 456 applicants from this area alone. In the North-Western Division a special section in connection with seasonal work was set up at the Liverpool Exchange. Throughout the division dead and reference registers were searched for suitable applicants, with good results.The view is generally expressed that very few private domestics were drawn into this work, although at the end of the season there appears to have been some movement from seasonal into private work.OUT-OF-WORK DONATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFIT.Out-of-Work Donation. Returns by the Finance Department, according to informa-tion received at the Claims and Record Office, Kew, for the week ending the 23rd December, show 193,412 payments to policy holders, involving an amount of  180,937 9s. 9d.Unemployment Insurance. The number of payments of unemployment insurance benefit during the week ending the 17th December, was 206,808, involving an amount of  118,404 19s. Id.National Scheme.Up to and including the 29th December, 23,448 certificates have been issued to employers under the scheme. The undertakings given by these employers cover 258,239 disabled ex-service men.The Divisional Controller for Wales reports that, despite general depression in trade throughout the division, the live register shows a slight reduction. Fresh registrations indicate that a number of men are now being discharged from hospitals. The Divisional Controller for Scotland reports that the number of disabled men placed in employment during the last month was the lowest on record. Widespread unemployment makes it a matter of extreme difficulty to find work for the disabled men, and there is little or no prospect of an early improvement.[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment and Insurance Department will also be found on pages 20 to 23, 28, 30, 38 and 39.]APPOINTMENTS AND CIVIL LIABILITIES DEPARTMENT.APPOINTMENTS.Statistics. During the week ending the 24th December the Appointments Depart-ment placed 513 candidates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 47,433. Of these, 6,459 have been placed through the agency of the departments Interviewing Boards. Applications were registered from 562 ex-Service men and 19 civilians.  The number of candidates available for appoint-DISCHARGED AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.APPOINTMENTS AND TRAINING.(b 16822t)E
TRAINING DEPARTMENT.INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men.Statistics. On the 28th December, 24,932 men were in training, as against 25,065 on the 21st December and 24.860 on the 30th November. The number of men placed in training during the week was 133. There were 16,304 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 21st December and the 30th November being 16,186 and 16,751, respectively. The number of men whose training had been completed since the, 1st August, 1919, was 22,998, the totals for the 21st December and the 30th November being 22,732 and 21,516, respectively.With very few exceptions the reports generally indicate that, mainly owing to industrial depression, the training scheme is passing through a period of exceptional difficulty, and it is not unsatisfactory to find that the statistics generally show that there has as yet been very little serious loss of ground.ments on the 24th December was 10,474 ex-Service men and 1,382 civilians. At the same date 1,152 &quot; live &quot; vacancies were,at the disposal of the department, 620 having been registered during the week.Reports from Directorates. The Director at Manchester reports that, in view of the state of trade, the record of placings in appointments is not unsatisfactory, but a con-siderable proportion of the situations filled are of a temporary nature. It is impossible to speak yet of any improvement in trade, but hopes of a revival in the cotton industry have been stimulated by the official estimate of the American crop.BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.Maintenance and Training Grants Scheme. During the week ending the 24th Decem-ber the Appointments Department received 25 applications for training under this scheme, of which 13 were for training of the type provided by the department. Deducting can-cellations and withdrawals, 28,243 applications for training of this type have been received in all, and 49,907 for the types provided by other Government departments. The Interviewing Boards have dealt to date with 27,627 applications, of which 23,165 have been recommended. The Grants Committee dealing with applications so recom-mended, have received 22,043 applications and sanctioned grants in 18,211 cases.Business Training Scheme. During the week ending the 24th December the Appointments Department received 124 applications for training under this scheme, bringing the total number of applications to 1,382, of which 220 have since been cancelled. Grants have been sanctioned in 171 cases. At the same date, 269 &quot; live &quot; training vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 49 having been registered during the week.Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant. The Appointments Depart-ment have dealt with a total of 966 cases, in 452 of which the training sanctioned is provided by the Appointments Department and in the remainder by other Government Departments. Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed their training in 247 cases, and abandoned training in 45 ; 144 are still in training and 16 are awaiting training.Reports from Directorates. The Controller of the Appointments and Training Branch Ireland, reports that cases under the Maintenance and Training Grants Scheme now coming up for review indicate the satisfactory results of this scheme. In many cases the salary has now reached a figure sufficient to warrant a discontinuance of the grant. In one recent case the firm have stated that no grant will be necessary after another six months, as they then intend to employ the trainee in a managerial capacity at  500 per annum.The Business Training Scheme has been most carefully considered by the Selective Committees both in Dublin and Belfast and, while heartily endorsing the principles of the scheme and promising it their full support, both committees have come to the conclusion that the scheme, as it stands, is not altogether suited to conditions in Ireland, and have put forward suggestions as to its amendment.
(b 16822T)* G.I.F. Memorandum No. 7a.Man placed in training during the last four months of the year numbered 7,926. Since September, when the monthly total stood at 2,406, there has been a rather marked decline ; 1,554 placings only were recorded for December. In the four months preceding September just under 9,000 men were placed in training, including over 3,000 during the month of June.Elementary Teachers. In connection with the development of schemes for training colleges for elementary school teachers, the Divisional Director for Scotland has been informed that men from his area may be accepted for training at English centres, but that the establishment of a centre of this class in Scotland is not at present contemplated.Organisation of Training. A memorandum^ has been published giving suggestions as to the organisation of training in Government Instructional Factories.Government Instructional Factories. A visit was paid recently to the Walker-on-Tyne Factory by the divisional committee of the building trade, who were very favourably impressed by the quality of the bricklaying work on four houses which are being built on the Walker estate. The divisional committee of the tailoring trade also visited the factory, and appeared to be well satisfied with the system under which the men are now working.Good progress is reported by the manager of the Camden Town Factory. All the men in training here are engaged on productive work, and the contracts include 500 boot and shoe kit boxes, and 250 sets of end vice iron work, both on order from headquarters.Training at the new Blackheath Factory was started just before Christmas with a cabinet making class of 12 men.The Forbesiield Road Factory, Aberdeen, report the loss in a storm of the motor boat used for the instruction of men in marine motor mechanics and driving. The crew were rescued by the trawler which was being towed at the time. The manager is very anxious that sanction for the supply of a new boat should be forthcoming.According to the latest complete return, made up to end of October, men in the building trades were by far the largest group in the factories, forming 30 per cent, of the total. On this date there were over 2,000 men training in various branches of the industry, half of whom were carpenters and joiners and over one-fifth bricklayers. There were nearly 1,000 men in training for tailoring and a like number in the furniture trades, in-cluding over 400 cabinet makers and nearly 200 upholsterers. Other large groups were the men training for mechanical engineering and vehicle building, the number in either case being about 600. In the vehicle building section numbers are rapidly increasing, but for some time past there has been a tendency among the engineers rather in the direction of a falling off than an advance in numbers.Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.Statistics. Up to the 29th December agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 45,145 apprentices under the 41 schemes approved. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 43,194 apprentices employed by 17,222 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties is now 15,688.Wages. Some engineering apprentices in the South-Western area are still reported as not receiving the required rates of wages under the scheme. The matter has been taken up with local headquarters by the district secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, who has promised to co-operate, and interview the firms concerned. It is possible that the underpayment may be limited in some cases to the amount of the State grant. Delays in clearing up outstanding payments to apprentices are also reported in the lace industry of the West of England. .Period of Renewed Training. The Goulds Foundries, Ltd., Cardiff, urge that, before returning to their pre-war employers to complete their apprenticeship, apprentices should be given one year&apos;s preliminary training, to enable them to recover their lost knowledge, at some instructional factory under the State.Abdications. A survey of &quot; unmated &quot; apprentices on the registers of Employment Exchanges on the 15th December indicates a great reduction in the number of those who cannot find employers under the scheme, compared with the previous survey in June. The total had dropped from 1,753 to 378, and there has been some further reduction since. There is reason to believe, however, that the numbers may be considerably in excess of
the figures returned, but after all allowance is made, the reduction is undoudtedly large. As the more eligible apprentices, however, are most readily dealt with, the remainder are likely to contain a high proportion of difficult cases.&quot; Unmated &quot; apprentices are now most numerous in the South-Western area, owing to the opposition of many, and especially the smaller, employers in the extreme South-West. The total, which stands at 105, has been reduced by little more than one-half, and less in proportion in any other area. The most remarkable decrease is in Scotland, where the numbers have declined from 622 to 54. The smallest figures are shown by the West Midlands area with 9 ; the South Midlands and Eastern area with 11 ; and the Northern area with 10.Acceptance or Non-Acceptance. The scheme is reported to have, worked smoothly throughout in the Newport (Mon.) area, the employers having rendered every assistance to make it a success.A final and satisfactory settlement is now reported in the plumbing trade at Edinburgh. Though the controversy has been long-continued, and the result a heavy blow to the employers, it has apparently left no ill-feeling in their minds towards the department, while the assistance that has been given in completing applications and preparing claims for State grant is fully recognised.Non-Observance of Conditions. The long-continued refusal of Messrs. John Lewis &amp; Co., Aberdeen, engineers, to treat their apprentices in accordance with the scheme still continues. When all other means had failed, the apprentices, 17 in number, decided to bring the matter before the Local Employment Committee, and steps were taken to constitute a trade panel to hear their case. The other local employers in the industry, however, have refused to serve upon the panel, being unwilling to sit in judgment on a fellow member of their association. It is now expected that the matter will be taken by the operatives direct to the Sheriffs Court.Progress of Training. Local headquarters for the London and South-Eastern area again report the results of inspections of training to be satisfactory. They mention in particular, that a number of apprentice printers, whose training under the scheme has recently been concluded, have been retained as journeymen by their employers. Such retention can generally be regarded as satisfactory evidence of progress.Institutional Training. In the West Midlands, the general trade depression is increasingly leading to the suspension of apprentices under the scheme, though every effort is being made by local headquarters to induce employers to retain them as long as possible, or to arrange for institutional training. Most employers are doing their best to retain the men, but local headquarters fear that a prolonged depression must lead to serious inter-ruption in their renewed apprenticeship. In the South-Western area, also, suspensions of apprentices under the scheme are numerous, and many of. the men are applying for institutional training.Numerous applications for institutional training continue to be received in the London and South-Eastern area. Some of these are probably due, as elsewhere, to depression in trade. These applications are not confined to men resident in the area ; some of them have been made from as far afield as Newcastle-on-Tyne or Elgin. Nevertheless, local headquarters report that, in nearly all instances, they have been able to provide the training needed. In the South-Western area, applications for training have been received in bootmaking, cycle fitting, plumbing and wheelwrighting, but with the exception of the first, no facilities exist in the area.The proposed class for painters&apos; apprentices at Aberdeen has fallen through as a result of lack of energy on the part of the operatives, who had strongly urged its formation, and apparently of lack of favour, if not actual opposition, on the part of. employers. At Edinburgh, both employers and operatives in the plumbing trade are pressing strongly for a whole-time course for the apprentices. It remains to be seen, however, whether a sufficient number of applicants will in fact be forthcoming.GENERAL TRAINING.Apprenticeship : Building.-ln the West Midlands, delays in considering the national scheme have been caused by the recently terminated strike at Rugby, and m some cases it is not immediately practicable to arrange joint conferences. Both sides, have, however, been approached in a number of districts. The employers so far seem more conversant with the1 scheme than the operatives.  The latter, however, when once certain initial
398.1.2Lsuspicions are removed, show signs of taking the matter up enthusiastically. Bedford already has a local scheme which is very similar to the national scheme; at Sheffield, employers, workpeople and the local education authorities now favour the holding of a joint conference; and at Bromley the employers have appointed a sub-committee to consider the scheme, and, if necessary, to arrange a joint meeting with the operatives. At Ipswich, the employers seem ready to adopt the scheme, but with a lower scale of wages. They are opposed, however, to compulsory continued education. The Bury St. Edmunds Master Builders&apos; Association are not affiliated to the national federation, but their chairman strongly advocates the proper organisation of apprenticeship and technical training.Apprenticeship : Farriery and Blacksmithing In Wales, some very high-class work is reported to be carried out in some of the blacksmiths&apos; shops. On the other hand, practically no provision is made for technical training in the industry; and great com-plaint is sometimes made that it is neglected in this respect. Local headquarters, however, point out that this state of affairs is unavoidable. With the trade so scattered, and so few boys entering it, it is practically impossible to organise classes in country districts, and even in towns like Cardiff, Newport and Swansea, there appear not to be sufficient to form a class. The South Wales district secretary of the Master Farriers&apos; Association favours making attendance at technical classes compulsory, along with an examination to be passed in the fifth year of apprenticeship ; but local headquarters consider that under present conditions classes are not necessary.Apprenticeship: Furniture. In the West Midlands, the inquiry into this industry has revealed that the conditions of training and recruitment are often chaotic, but that, even so, not a few excellent craftsmen are turned out; and there appears to exist in the industry a pride of craftsmanship such as is not apparent in many others.Supply of Apprentices: Ironmoulding. There is still considerable evidence of the reluctance of boys to enter this industry, and of the difficulty of retaining those who do. The causes at work are much the same as those previously reported, the attractions of more highly paid unskilled labour, ignorance of the prospects offered by the industry, the heavy and unpleasant nature of the work, the long period of apprenticeship, and, in some cases, objection to a binding indenture. Apart from other remedies, an attempt is suggested to divert into ironmoulding the surplus of lads who wish to become fitters and turners, but cannot do so. At the same time, the reports show the shortage to be neither so universal nor so serious as it was a year ago. This is specially so in Wales, where, for instance, a Newport foundry, unable to secure apprentices in February, had obtained as many as they could employ by November. Little difficulty in securing apprentices is also reported from the Mansfield district, notwithstanding the competition of the coal mines.Supply of Apprentices: Other Industries. In the tailoring trade at Rochdale the shortage appears to be serious and one leading employer urges that the department take the matter up immediately. In Scotland, with the decrease in sailing vessels, the sail-making trade has declined greatly, but the supply of apprentices seems still inadequate. This is due to difficulty not in securing, but in retaining boys, who usually leave it after a time for trades offering better prospects.
