The Office vdll hence-forth be for six years instead of during pleasure; and it will more resemble that of a Governor General of a Dominion, then that of a Minister of the United Kingdom.   I would ask for authority to prepare th; necessary instruments, irrespective of tho question of the continuance in office of the present holder.2.   OFFICES Or CHI2? 3SCRS1V.RY AI.D 0?. LORD CHi-IICBLLOR OF IRELAND,On the new appointment of the lord Lieutenant tho office of Chief Secretary will disappear; and a decision is sought regarding tho office which is to tafco its place.As regards tho Lord Chancellor, tho radical change in the character of this Office also will render a now
form of appointment necessary.   For tho future In tenure ond functions the Office is to bo judicial only and to be divested of its politioal and executive character.

i Q10APPENDIX TO C,P,j3444^Memorradur. on the practicabi 1 ity of holding El actions J for the&apos; ParliAinent ^f N or th ern Ireland i  J2-^*iL0;1 e for&apos; the Parlianont-of Southern Ireland,1. The Parliament of Northern Ireland could be  summonedand the elections in Northern Ireland could be held before a Parliament is summoned and elections are held in Southern Ireland; but the first summoning and mooting of a Parliament is only one of a series of steps towards bringing the Act into complete operation; when one step has been taken other steps must follow successively at comparatively short, intervals; and for several of the steps following upon the first meeting of the Parliament of ono part of Ireland it is .essential that there should be in existence in the other part of. Ireland either a Parliament with a responsible executive or the legislative assembly and executive committee which are to operate in their place under the suspensory clause (svr/.2)E2. When the Parliament first meets it will not he able to-legislate effectively or at all until an executive has bean set up to administer its government, and carry out its legislation^ and neither the Parliament nor the executive can operate. \mti\ funds are available to defray the expenses of their operations...^ These rands must be drawn from the local Exchequer (ss,2G &amp; 21 (2), and although the local Exchequer can be financed&apos;by means of advances from the Imperial Exchequer on account of its. portion of the residuary share of reserved taxes under regulations of the Joint Exchequer Board (s*24 (2)); this is only a temporary expedient; further,, even when funds have reached the local Exchequer they cannot be withdrawn from.it without the authority of an appropriation act of the Parliament (s-,20)    except during&apos;.-a-period of three. months- from the first
meeting of tho Parliamentv   During that period the Joint Exchequer Board may authorise tho Lord Lieutenant to make payments out of the loci Exchequer in orde^ to provide for bringing the Act into operation (s,34 (3)).     It is thus apparent that even those temporary- emergency-&apos; provisions cannot take effect until the- Joint Exchequer Board- has&quot;-bo--in established, md, -seeing that the- Joint Exchequer-Board is -to- include a member appointed by the.Treasury of -Southern Ireland and a .member appointed by the Treasury of Northern Ireland, it cannot bp established until a &quot;Treasury&quot; has &quot;been set up in each part of Ireland,;Further, the functions of each existing department now .administering Irish services must be transferred to ,the Govern-ments of. Southern and Northern Ireland simultaneously, and the clvi 1 servants employed in the department must be. transferred en bloc to the two new Governments\    The whole -scheme of the Act is inconsistent with one part of Ireland remaining under the United Kingdom Government and departments of that Govern-me-nt, whilst the .other part is under.a separate Government of its own and departments of., such GovernmentsFurther, the allocation of existing civil servants between South and North and -the..determination of their rights and claims fall to the Civil Service Committee, one of whose members is to be appointed by the Government .cf Southern Ireland snd one by the Government of Northern Ireland (ss*56, 58, and 59),   The two Governments must tbufl be in existence before either Government can take over the functions find officers of any existing department,,
It would appear to follow from the foregoing that, a date cannot safely be fixed for the holding of the elections for the - Northern Parliament until Government is satisfied upon two points&apos;First, that it will be possible to hold elections in Southern Ireland very shortly after the date so fixed, and, secondly, that all the preparations for setting in notion the new system of government, both in North and South, have been completed or are so far advanced as to ensure that the essential machinery of government can bo started in North and South within a&apos; brief period,These preparations Involve the determination by the Cabinet of a number of preliminary questions cf great importance and a vast amount of legal and departmental work, viz:t.     Office ,of Lord. Lieutenant.      A new appointment to this office (Whether tho present holder is to continue in office 0&apos;-&apos; not) will have to bo made.     In the future the -office is to be&apos; held for a term of six years Instead of during pleasure, and Roman Catholics will be eligible (s.37).     Apart altogether from tenure, the character of the office is entirely changed by the Act,     So far as respects matters within the province of either of the new Parliaments and Governments, it will resemble that of the Governor General of a Dominion or, rather, of two Dominions combined.     So far as respects all Irish matters not within the province of either Parliament and Government (e,g. all the excluded matters enumerated In section 4, Supreme Courts, and the other reserved matters enu-merated in section 9, including police) it :vill
resemble that of on officer of the United Kingdom Government, to answer for whom there must be a responsible Linistor at. Westminster,Further^ tho question of ...iving or withholding His !*ajesty!s assent to Bills Imposes a greater responsibility on the Lord Lieutenant than is imposed upon a Governor General of any Dominion, seeing that on account of the express exclusion of many subjects from the powers of the Irish Parliaments questions of ultra vires aro more likely to arise, and owing to the presence of Irish representatives In both Houses of the United Kingdom Parliament the propriety of giving or withholding His MajestyTs assent to Irish Bills and the acts of the Lord Lieutenant generally are more likely to be debated in the United Kingdom Par IIament.It is therefore a matter for consideration whether the Lord Lieutenant&apos;s position should be defined cither in the new letters patent or In instructions to he given by Ris Majesty, similar to those given to a Governor General,     At any rate, the form of the letters patent now used Is obsolete and likely to mislead.Office of Chief Secretary.      Tho Chief. Secretary I Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,, and, whatever decision may be taken as to the Minister to be responsible in future for Irish matters, it is obvious that the present, title cannot be retained.     In tho future the title &quot;Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant would be more appropriate to the Prime Ministers -of Southern, and Northern Ireland than to a minister of the United Kingdom Government who will be the authority for conveying to the Lord Lieutenant the instructions of
that Government,     &quot;Secretary for Ireland&quot; cr &quot;Secretary of State for Irclend&quot; might be a suitable designation. Unless tho new Minister is a Secretary of State, the of&apos;?ice would be a now&apos;office of profit, and tho holder would be disqualified for sitting in Pan&apos;1 lament without an express enactment to the contrary.Lord Chancellor, of Ireland.^      A new appointment will also be necessary to this office,  as tho office is to bo divested of Its political and executive character and Is to be held for life instead of during pleasure (s,44). As r consequence of this change the custody of the Great Seal of Ireland is to pass from the Lord Chancellor to the Lord Lieutenant, together with the officers in charge thereof, 1,0,, the clerk of the Grown and Hanaper, who is concerned with the issue and returns of writs of election (a,44 &amp; Seventh Schedule   Part 111,3),Joint Exchequer Board,t      For the purposes of tho financial provisions of the Act tho early establishment of the Joint Exchequer Board is essential..,     Of Its fivo members, two are to be appointed by the Treasury, and the chairman is to be appointed by His Lajosty (s,32),-These appointments require consideration,-The Civil Service Committee,,     Of the&apos; seven members, ono is to be appointed by the Treasury   one by a Secretary of State, and one by the Lord.Chief Justice of EnglandP     These appointments will have to be made before civil servants can be allocated between North and South (s.56).Lor6^ chief Justice^of Northern Ireland,. -   The appointment to this office will have to be made at least one month before the abolition of the present Supreme Court (Seventh Schedule, Part 111,1),
In the work mentioned at VIII above the co-operation and assistance cf the Treasury and Revenue Departments, as well as the Irish departments; will be essential.VII. adaptation of Statutes^    The careful examina-tion of every Act of Parliament affecting Ireland, whether paseed before or after the Union, and the noting of every provision which requires to be adapted to the new conditions, the consideration and determination of what adaptations can and ought to be made (some formal, others involving Important constitutional or political questions and affecting seriously individuals or large interests), and the preparation of Orders in Council embodying the adaptations which will have to be laid before both Houses (ssc 61, 69 k 70).VIII. - Preliminary financial and administrative arrange-ments*     Preliminary financial arrangements on the part of the Treasury and Revenue departments arrangements as to the apportionment of department-al funds and other property between North and South, arrangements with respect to transfer of staff and accommodation for the new departments, and for the establishment and accommodation of the new Supreme Courts. It is submitted that the preliminary work indicated at VII. above should be distributed amongst the several Departments, both in Ireland and England, administering Irish services, so far as respect the statutes affecting the respective depart-merits, and that they should act In accordance with general instructions Issued on Cabinet authority, and under the supervision of Parliamentary Counsel and other qualified personswho should submit any important questions for the decision of the law officers or the Cabinet.
5. &quot;Before an Election is hold for cither part of Irelandtho following instruments will have to &quot;bo prepared and embodied in an Ordor in CouncilAn adaptation of tho existing election laws, that is to say, the laws relating to tho issue and execution of writs,the taking of tho noli, the method of voting and countingquestioning of&quot;elections, corrupt and illegal practices * the votes, tho/oath, qualification anc disqualification ofmefaborB* and tho vacating of Boats (a, 15 (2)),Those laws, as thoy stand, are applicable to olootions for tho United &apos; in gel om House of Commons, to existing constituencies and to existing courts.,     They will have to bo altered so as to be applicable to olootiens for the Irish Houses of Commons, to tho now Irish constituencies and to tho how Irish courts, and tho Order must contain regulations pro-scribing the method of voting and the duties of returning officers under the proportional representation system, which is to bo followed at these elections and also at the elections to tho Northern Senate and certain elections to the southern Senate (s, 14 (3) $our th S c he du 1 o 4).&quot;revision will also have to be made by Order in Council with respect to the election of senators, including the issue of writs, tho modes of sorvioc, and the returns to bo made to tho writs (Fourth .3cnodule 1) 8In tho case of the jouthorn Senate tho arrangements will bo somewhat difficult, as thoy will involve the appointment of returning officers and the prescribing of rules for the registration of electors and the holding of elections for such . strange electorates an &quot;the archbishops and bishops of tho Roman Catholic Church holding sees situated wholly or partly in
Southern Ireland;   &apos;the peers who are taxpayers or ratepayers in respect of property in and have residences In Southern Ireland&quot;; &quot;the members of His Majesty1s Privy Council In Ireland who are taxpayers or ratepayers in respect of property In and have residences In Southern Ireland&quot;, and the members of the Southern county councils voting together in four different groups.When these preparations are completed and the new appoint ments of the Lord Lieutenant and Lord Chancellor have been made (if it Is agreed that this is necessary) and an appointed day has been fixed for the purposes of elections and the first meeting of the parliaments, the procedure would be on the following lines:-The Lord Lieutenant will issue a proclamation under the Great Seal of Ireland, in His Majesty&apos;s name, summoning the Parliament to meet at a place and time specified, not less than twenty clear day8 after the date of the proclamation.Simultaneously with the proclamation writs of election would be issued to the several returning officers *     The date of election to the House of Commons would be the eighth day after the date of the proclamation, and the date of the poll would be the ninth day after the day of election (Representa-tlon of the People Act, 1918/ 8. 21 (3) and Second Schedule).The election of Senators would, In the case of the Southern Senate, be held as soon as possible after the proclama tlon, and presumably writs would be sent to the ex offlcio senators and possibly to the nominated senators also, the Lord Lieutenant having, in the case of the Southern Senate, nomlna-ted seventeen representatives of commerce, labour, and the scientific and learned professions.
In the case of the northern Senate there will he two senators only - the Lord Mayor of Belfast and the Mayor of Lone&quot;.onoerry - on the day of&apos; the first meeting of the Northern   Parliaments    Writs will presumably be sent to them, and the northern House of Commons will proceed without delay to elect the twenty.*four remaining members of the northern Senate.For the general lines of procedure on the first meeting of the Parliament see Erskine May, 12th Edition, cap 7, page 1396
