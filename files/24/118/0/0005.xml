^ uConversion of Demand Obligations of the British Government held bj? the United btates Treasury into Long Term Bonds0Instructions to Treasury representative,iU**   n................&apos;i.....m&apos;&quot;.........iM.li,     iXi ..    .....   .1,     m,i.rA*     ^neral.     The 11 funding&quot; of the british call obligations to the United utates of ^merica Government was last discussed in September 1919, between Mr. Blackett and Mr. Kathbone.   The British Treasury liepresontative then received instructions, a cop;/ of which is_    annexe&amp;*In the last two paragraphs of part A of those instructions, the Chancellor of the Exchequer sets out his views on the desirability of cancelling or reducing Inter-Allied . IndebtaLb.ess. Intimations of these views have been given to the United btates Government on two occasions.(1) To President Wilson in Paris in the summer of 1919,(2) Through the Embassy at Washington in the spring of 1920,In each case the reply has been definitely unfavourable; and the Cabinet have decided that it is no longer consonant with either the dignity or the good faith of the British Government to defer further the question of funding British debt to America in the hope of a &apos; solution which vould link funding of demand obligations with the treatment of Inter-Allied Debt.The
The general attitude of the Treasury Representa-tive should therefore he that, Trhile the British opinion cf the desirability of a general cancellation or other similar measure remains unchanged,   his present instructions are that Great Britain desires to fufil -Trhatever obliga-tions she has given to tha United States of America without seeking again to raise the above question in con-neat ion therewith.      Nevertheless the fulfilment of Britain&apos;s obligations should not take a form which may render a future reconsideration of the whole question of Inter-Allied Debt impracticable.It follows that there shall be no stipulation as to the treatment which Great Britain is to give her Allies or as to the financial or commercial policy of this country in Europe or generally.     But it may be stated that Great Britain has every intention of giving her Allies at least as favourable terms as regards redemption of Wai Debt as America gives to Great Britain.The principles involved in^conversion.Assuming that at present the question of Inter-Allied Debt is laid aside, the British Government1s object is to give such a form to their obligations held by the United States Treasury as will lessen the loan which nowimpedes a general financial recovery, and in particular ; impedes international trade.     They conceive it particularly desirable so to apportion the iimas of re-payment that, while the intereeto of the United States of. America shall be fully safeguarded, the United Kingdom whall not experience a sudden strain.upon oither its foreign exchange or upon ltd internal resources.
The matter of the Juo:.ij; Jorn^Bonds. In order to carry out the above principles, the British Government consider it desirable that the Long Term Bonds into which their Certificates of Debt are convert-ible should provide as follows(1)   That no interest on the British debt shall be charged for three years from May 1919*(2)   if this is possible, that such interest shall not be added to the interest bearing capital of the debt, but shall be collected gradually, r&amp;without compound interest, in a period of years subsequent to Hovember 1921.(5)   that the Bonds shall bear fixed dates of maturity and shall bear as low a rate of interest as possible; and that the dates of maturity shall be the latest permissible under the terms of the several Acts of Congress under which advances were made by the United. States of America Treasury.(4)   His Majestyrs Government would not propose to attach any specific sinking fund to the Bonds though they would in fact contemplate repayment of a portion of the Bonds, in favourable circumstances before maturity. If the United States Government press for a specific sinking fund such sinking fund should (a) not operate until any postponed interest has been paid up, - or say until 1928.     (b) should not exceed a maximum of 1% per annum of the amount of the Bond.Such a sinking fund (if agreed) would be a minimum: there should be an option (see under E (3)) to Great Britain to repay larger amounts, if desired (query within a maximum to be agreed),.;.,(5)   that the Bonds shall remain in the possession of the United States Treasury during the whole of their existence.m      O     -The/
B. Th.ejfojm, of the ^ondeuin view of the fact that, under American lav, the whole o:&apos; the contract is required to &quot;be on the face of the Bonds, the Treasury Representative should not press for any understanding or undertaking which cannot be so expressed; nor should h3   seek to include provisions which would involve application by the United States Treasury to congress for further powers. F. Minor Points.Three small points remain -(1) Subro;j;ated gecuriticg.   Every effort should be made to secure the release of the at securities (whose retention involves a heavy charge on the British taxpayer) at a very early sta r,e in the negotiations.(2) Protection of the Dollar. The United States Treasury will probably wish to be able to call u..on the British Government to purchase dollars (and to repay either deferred interest or capital therewith) in the event of the Hew York exchange rate risin/; to above $4.86. This should be limited in amount, and mace conditional upon ^)   British option to repay, which should be given within such limits and safeguards as the United states Treasury may reasonably require *
INSTRUCTIONS OP SEPTEMBER 1919 aInterest payments upon demand obligations of the British Government held by the United States Treasury, and question of their conversion into long-term bonds *Instruction to British Treasury Representative.81! IU Wr W* M OS M W* W  W,1 Wl- iKt *M*A. General statement of the British Treasury&apos;s attitude.The existence of an external debt of some  .800,000,000 due by the British Government to the United States Government is largely if not entirely due to the necessity under which the British Government was placed during the mr not less after than before the entry of the United States of America as a belligerent, of making large advances to the Allied Governments to a total exceeding  1,600,000,000*Similarly the poorer of the British Treasury to pay interest and eventually to repay principal to the United States Treasury depends largely, if not entirely upon the arrangements made for payment of Interest and repayment of principal by. the other Allied Governments upon their obligations held by the British Treasury.,    Until therefore the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;-Is in possession of the views of the Secretary of the United States Treasury in regard to the payment of Interest.and repayment of principal by the Allied Governments (Including the British Govern-laent) in respect of their obligations in the hands of the United States Treasury, he finds some difficulty in making any definite proposals either&apos;as to the terms to be offered by him to theAllied
Allied Governments in respect of - their, debts to the British Treasury&apos; or as to the way in which the British Government^ debt to the United States Government is to be dealt -fith.The Chancellor of the Exchequer is, however, pre-pared to say at once that, whatever proposals the United States Government is willing to make for dealing with the obligationskhich it holds of the British and other Allied Governments, he is ready to recommend to the House of Commons equally favourable treatment for the obligations of the Allied Governments held by the British Treasury.For his part,-he is so seriously concerned at the political and diplomatic dangers which may arise, after the lapse of a few years, from the existence of a large body of debts due by one Allied or Associated Government to another that he would be glad, as part of a general arrangement between Government for dealing with Inter-Allied indebtedness, to recommend to the House of Commons that the whole of the sum advanced by the British Government to Allied or Associated Governments in connection with the prosecution of the war should be treated as part of the final war expenditure of the British Government.Similarly, if some less drastic solution of the oroblem is favoured, orovided it formed oart of some such general arrangement between Governments / the Chancellor of the Exchequer is ready to recommend to the House of Commons a complete or partial waiver of interest, or a reduction of the orincipal of Allied Government obligations held by the British Government, or&apos;the conversion of the whole or a part of such obligations into German Indemnity Bonds, &amp;&apos;c, &amp;c., to such extent as might be agreed upon by the Governments concerned*B-
B. General lin? to be taken by the British Treasury Representative.

If the United States Treasury itself puts forward proposals for dealing with the principal and interest of the Allied Government obligations which it holds, the British Treasury Representative will be guided in his  consideration of them by the above general statement of the British position, and his aim will be to secure the most favourable terms possible, using as a lover the declared readiness of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make equal concessions in respect of the obligations of Allied Governments hold by the British Treasury.

If, however, the United States Treasury desires to receive proposals from the British and other Governments on the matter, the British Treasury Representative will reply by a statement of the general position of the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the above lines. Whether such a statement should be made in writing or verbally only will be a matter for consideration in the light of the circumstances cf the moment. In thin and in all matters the British Treasury Representative will act under the general directions of the British Ambassador at Washington. ? Payment of Interest on British Government obligations held by the United States Treasury.

It is generally understood that the United States Treasury does not desire to collect interest this autumn and is prepared to postpone the date of the first payment of interest for not less than one and not mere than three years. It is doubtful, however, whether the official United States Treasury has as yet advanced beyond the idea of merely postponing interest subject to subsequent payment of arrears plus interest on such arrears.

The
Tho British Treasury&quot;Repr^esentatlvo should aim at securing,(1) postponement of date of collection of first intones f*.r at least three years;(2) if possible complete waiver of interest during such interval,(3)   in any case the dropping of any thought of charging interest upon delayed paymenoso&apos; (The difficulty as regards (2) and (3) is that under the relevant Statutes the United States Treasury is bound to charge interest at a rato n^t less than the cost to it of raising the money used in purchasing Foreign Government obligations).It is believed that the United States Treasury proposes to charge Interest at the rate of 5^.   Before finally agreeing to such rate the British Treasury Representative should endeavour to secure some evidence in support cf the claim of the United States treasury that the rate is justified, by the cost to the United States Treasury of raising the money D. Form cf the Definitive BoncL-Thile there will be advantages in having ^iir^demand obligations converted into long-term obligations., the Chancellor of the Exchequer would have preferred, for many reasons, that Inter-Allied indebtedness should remain for the present In the form of ItOtU^ without definite dates of maturity.   It is understood, however, that the United S+ates Treasury feels unable for Parliamentary reasons to arrange for postponement of interest this year unless it does so in connection with conversion of demand obligations into definite bonds, in accordance with the powers conferred upon the Secretary of tho Treasury by the relevant Liberty Loan Acts.The Chancellor of the Exchequer proposes therefore to
to agree to conversion of demand obligations into definite bonds with fixed maturity dates, provided that such conversion can be effected without prejudice to the discussion at some moro oonveniont moment of somo comprehensive plan for dealing with Inter-Allied indebtedness as a whole.The constitutional law and practice of the United States of America make it impossible for tho United States Government to enter into binding undertakings oxcept in accordance vgith previously obtained statutory powers.   It follows that all tho agreements which it is desired to enter into in this connection must ho included in the text of the bond itself,     (The only alternative would be some sort of Treaty involving ratification by the Senate).Tho following are tho most important provisions which the British Treasury Representative will endeavour to havo included in the definite bond:-(a)   maturity dates of 15 June, 1947 for advances made to the British Government under tho First Liberty loan  Act (about $1,100,000,000) and 15 October 1938 for the balance (about $3,100,000,000).These are tho maximum periods undor tho relevant Acts of Congress.(b) exclusion of any provision for a compulsory sinking fund or earlier repayment, but the debtor to havo option of osrlier repayment.(c) the bonds to be payable ia dollars only without any option.to the holder to be paid in sterling whether at the par of exchange or any other rate, provision for protecting-the dollar against Its gaing to &amp; serious discount being .made in the form of an undertaking by the British Treasury to purchase dollars, if and when it goes to a discount, in sufficient amounts to restore parity.(d) exclusion if possible of any power to tho United States Treasury to sell British Government bonds held by It to its nationals.HiAS
As a last concession this power raid.it he granted, if the date at which it la first oxercisable is postponed for  t least ten yearsuBut it is possible that a solution of anticipated difficulty in this mattor may be reaohod by giving a bond which Vvhile ostensibly saleable to United States nationals is so entiroly unsuitable for the purpose that the power cannot in fact bo exercised,Subrogated Securities^ The British Treasury Representative v/ill do his best in connection with the conversion into definitive bonds to secure the release from subrogation ox tho British Treasury owned and deposited securities now held under subrogation to the Unitod States Treasury*3?*    obligation .with representatives of l?rench and other Allied Treasuries,while it is desirable that at least tho Ireneh Treasury should bo generally avvare of the British Treasuryrs negotiations with the United States Treasury in these matters, it is important that the British Treasury should insist on its position as a fellow-creditor with the United States Treasury rather than as a fellow-debtor with the French Treasury.
