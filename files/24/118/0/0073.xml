REPORT OF TELEPHONE RATES COMMITTEE, 1920.To The Postmaster-General :1. In compliance with your Minute of the 7th May 1919, we submit the following Report.During the course of our inquiry, the costs, both of labour and plant, have steadily risen. In the last 12 months the average cost of telephone plant has increased from 147 per cent, to 170 per cent, above pre-war prices, and during the same period the Post office staff have been granted considerable additions to wages, of which 1,750,0001. is estimated to be chargeable against the Telephone Service.The continued rise in costs lias necessitated frequent revisions of the estimated expenditure of the service and of the rates proposed to be charged. The tariff which we now recommend is based upon the costs, both for labour and plant, obtaining at the present date, allowance being made in respect of that portion of the plant which was provided in more favourable conditions.HISTORY OF BRITISH TARIFFS.2. The telephone was invented and introduced into this Country in 187G. In 1880 it was held by the Courts that a telephone is a telegraph within the meaning of the Telegraph Acts, and it was established by this decision that communications by telephone between two independent persons required the licence of the Postmaster-General. Licences, expiring on December 31st, 1911, were granted to a number of companies, but The National Telephone Company, which, acquired the original telephone patents, succeeded in either buying up or extinguishing its rivals and secured a virtual monopoly. The master patents expired in 1890 and 1891 and effective competition then became possible.3. As the telephone system developed and different towns were connected by what are known as trunk wires, its importance as a national system of communication became increasingly evident, and in 1892 an Act was passed authorising the Post-master-General to purchase and to extend the trunk wire system of The National Telephone Company. An agreement was concluded with the Company in 1896 under which about 29,000 miles of wire were purchased for a sum of 459,11 il. Thenceforth the operations of The National Telephone Company were restricted to local exchange areas, which were specially delimited at the time of the transfer of the trunk system or subsequently.4. About 1896 a number of municipalities evinced a desire to manage their own local telephone service, and in 1899, on the recommendation of a Select Com-mittee of the House of Commons, the Postmaster-General offered to grant, telephone licences to municipalities and announced that the Post Office would establish a local exchange system in London. In addition to the States of Guernsey, thirteen municipalities received licences, and municipal systems were actually established in Brighton, Glasgow, Hull, Portsmouth, Swansea, and Tunbridge Wells. After a short trial all except Hull sold out either to the Post Office or to The National Telephone Company.5. In 1901 the Post Office and The National Telephone Company agreed to charge the same rates in London and to give free intercommunication between the two systems and settled the terms for the ultimate purchase of the Company&apos;s London system when its licence expired at the end of 1911.The first Post Office Exchange in London (Central Exchange) was opened on the 1st March 1902.In 1905 the Postmaster-General and the Company signed an agreement fixing the conditions of purchase of the whole of the Company &apos;s undertaking in 1911, and on the 1st -January 1912 the whole telephone service of the United Kingdom passed into the hands of the State, with the exception of the local system at Portsmouth, which was transferred on the 1st October 191.3, and of the local systems which still remain the properties of the municipality of Hull and of the States of Guernsey.
6. The following table shows the number of telephone stations (exchange and private wire), including the Post Office, Municipal and National Telephone Coinpany&apos;s systems, in the United Kingdom at various dates : -Date. No. of Stations.31st December 1890 ..... 45,00031st December 1895 ..... 99,00031st December 1900 ----- 210,00031st December 1905 ..... 438,00031st December 1910 ..... 663,00031st December 1915 -        -                 -        - 818,00031st December 1919..... 911,000The term &quot; stations &quot; includes all subscribers&apos; instruments whether connected with exchange lines, extension lines, or private wires, and consequently the number of stations is greater than the number of subscribers or exchange lines.7. In the early years of the telephone service the annual charge, both in Great Britain and in the United States, was a flat rate, based on the distance from the subscribers premises to the exchange, but covering in every case an unlimited use of the exchange service. Later on it began to be realised that an unlimited service rate, which was necessarily high, was not adapted to the requirements of new subscribers and tended to check the development of the service. The cost of manufacturing telephone apparatus, wire and cable was at this time falling, and working costs were becoming more and more dependent on the number of calls. It was therefore felt that a lower rate, fixed with reference to the individual^ user, would be financially justified and would bring the telephone within the reach of a larger section of the public. These considerations led to the introduction in the provinces both by the Post Office and by The National Telephone Company in 1900 of the &quot;message rate,&quot; consisting of a relatively small annual charge plus a charge for each effective call originated by the subscriber. The annual charge was originally fixed at 3L, but that was found to be too low, and the Post Office adopted in 1907 a provincial rate of bl., covering 500 calls, which is still in force in what are known as &quot;Tariff A &quot; areas, and The National Telephone Company fixed a rate of 6/L, also covering 500 calls, in the areas, now known as &quot; Tariff B&quot; areas, where the Company&apos;s service predominated.8. In London the agreement of 1901 between the Post Office and The National Telephone Company provided for an unlimited service at 111. per annum (14L for the second and additional lines) and a message rate service at 61. 10s. per annum for exchanges within the County of London and 51. 10s. for exchanges in the outer London area, including 11. 10s. for calls. The charge for calls was fixed at Id. each with an additional Id. for calls (a) between an exchange within the County of London and an exchange in the outer London area; (6) between an exchange in the outer London area and any other exchange in the London area.9. In 1907 unlimited service rates were withdrawn in the provinces, on both the Post Office and the Company&apos;s systems, except for lines to private residences, but the existing subscribers were allowed to continue at their old rates, and a considerable number of such agreements are still extant.In 1915 the current rate for the unlimited service in London was raised from 17Z. to 20L for the first line and from 1U. to 17L for additional lines, and the provincial obsolete unlimited rate was similarly increased from 101. to 12L for the first line and from. SI. 10s. to I0L for additional lines.10. The telephone areas set up during the life of The National Telephone Company were retained after the transfer for the purpose of distinguishing between the trunk and local systems and the charges proper to each. As a rule the trunk fee is calculated upon the distance between the trunk centres of the areas between which the communication takes place. The scale of charges for a conversation of three minutes or less was fixed in 1896 at 3d. for distances not exceeding 25 miles, Qd. up to 50 miles, 9d. up to 75 miles, and Is. up to 100 miles, with an extra Qd, for each additional 40 miles or fraction thereof.In 1915 these rates were increased by a uniform addition of one-third.11. In addition to the regular tariffs already mentioned, there were in existence up to 1915 many obsolete rates, established by The National Telephone Company or a 12418 a a
by municipalities for purposes of competition. In some instances the Company had offered exceptionally low rates to force the sale of rival undertakings. In Glasgow there was an unlimited service rate of 5L 5s. offered by the Corporation and a residential rate of hi. covering 1,500 calls offered by the Company. A considerable number of old subscribers in Glasgow retained the benefit of these obsolete rates, while a new subscriber was charged the ordinary tariff &quot;A&quot; of hi., covering 500 calls. Similarly in London a number of subscribers were allowed to retain obsolete flat rates of 101. and 12L, while the &quot;current tariff for unlimited service was 171., and in the provinces unlimited rates of 11. 10s. were still in existence.12. In 1915-10 the whole of the obsolete rates, with the exception of the provincial flat rate, were swept away, the agreements being terminated by notice, and the principal tariffs now current may be summarised as follows :-London: - 20L for the first line; 111. for each additional line.- (jl. 10s. in the County of London; hi. 10s. in outer London, including in each case 11. 10s. for calls.Calls Id. each, with an additional Id. for calls between an exchange in the County of London and an exchange in outer London, and for calls between an exchange in outer London and any other exchange in the London area.Unlimited service rateMessage rate -Provinces: Unlimited service rate :  Private residences only -Business premises -Measured rates:  Tariff &quot;A.&quot; hi., covering 500 calls.Additional Calls: 8Z.121. for the first line and 101. additional line (restricted to made before 1907.)^ .

In 1913, the form of the Post Office telephone accounts was remodelled on the recommendations of a departmental committee in order to place the accounts on a commercial basis.   The system then adopted, provides (a) that the telephone undertaking should be debited with the value of services rendered to it by other Government departments, and should take credit for the value of telephone services rendered to other Government departments;(6) that plant and depreciation accounts should be set up and that, instead of the actual expenditure on renewals of plant, an annual sum should be charged against revenue representing depreciation, calculated on the estimated effective life of the several classes of plant;(c) that, instead of the actual pensions paid during the year, revenue should be charged annually in respect of pension liability with a sum equal to the

It will be seen that prior to the war the telephone service, taken as a whole, showed a fair margin of profit, which the rates then existing would have been sufficient to maintain, if conditions had remained unchanged and the system had developed on normal lines. But from 1914-15 onwards the effect of the war upon the finance of the service became more pronounced each year. By 1918-19 the war bonus granted to the staff had reached 1,200,0001., and the charge for the civil pay of men released for military service had risen to 364,O00L On the income side of the account, the revenue from the public, which should have shown a progressive expansion as the result of the large expenditure on development between 1913 and 1915, remained stationary, and would in fact have decreased if it had not been for the additional charges imposed in 1915-16. On the other hand the stagnation was masked by the credits derived from the extensive use of the telephone system by Government departments during the war. These credits rose from 65,0001. in 1913-14 to approximately 1,400,0001. in 1918-19.16. It is clear that the results of the five years ending March 1919 are of little or no value as a guide to the financial position of the telephone service in future. During a large part of the year 1919-20 the effect of the abnormal conditions was still felt. But 1920-2.1 will practically represent a normal year, and the estimated revenue and expenditure, compiled on a commercial basis and analysed under the principal headings, is shown in the following table.   For purposes of comparison thea4contribution estimated to be required on a sinking fund basis to provide for the eventual superannuation of the stall;(d) that interest should be charged against the undertaking on outstandingcapital expenditure, and credit should be taken for interest on sub-prescriptions paid in advance ;(e) that the undertaking should be charged with an annual rental in respect of sites and buildings belonging to the Post Office used for telephone purposes.These accounts are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and are published annually as a Parliamentary paper.1.4. The following is a summary of the accounts since 1912-13 :

It will be seen that the most important increases fall under the heads of administrative and operating expenses, engineering salaries and wages, depreciation, and pension liability.Administrative and operating expenses have risen by about 3,200,000?., and engineering salaries and wages by about 2,500,000Z. Of the total additional charge under these heads of 5,700,0001, 4,210,000?. or 74 per cent, is due to the war bonus and the remaining 26 per cent, is attributable partly to certain increases on the pre-war rates of wages and partly to normal development. The following table shows the gradual growth of wages and war bonus from 1913-14 to the current year: Financial Year.Salaries, Wages, &amp;c.War Bonus.Total.1913-14 -1914-15 -1915-16 -1916-17 -1917-18 -1918-19 -1919-20 (estimated) 1920-21 2,472,091 2,736,689 2,633,951 2,576,678 2,574,703 2,572,175 3,410,000 3,965,000 132,203 234,049 556,065 1,198,118 2,610,000 4,210,000 2,472,091 2,736,689 2,766,154 2,810,727 3,130,768 3,770,293 6,020,000 8,175,000In addition there are indirect charges for war bonus arising from Capital expenditure.18. Depreciation. The proper treatment of depreciation, in view of the enhanced cost of plant under present conditions, is a question of considerable difficulty. So long, as prices are relatively stable, the Depreciation Fund holds sufficient assets to provide for the cost of replacing each item of plant on the expiration of its normal life. But at present, the cost of renewal is nearly three times the original cost of the plant replaced, and the question arises whether the excess cost of renewals, i.e., the difference between the pre-war and the present cost, can properly continue to be charged to depreciation and, if so, whether any additional contribution should be made from revenue to strengthen the depreciation fund. The same problem neces-sarily confronts many other commercial undertakings, employing a large amount of permanent plant, and we understand various methods of meeting it have been adopted.
19. It is held in some quarters that the inflated values of the present day, when accompanied by increased earning capacity, justify the introduction of fresh capital and that the excess cost of renewals should be treated as capital expenditure. This policy has, we believe, been followed by the telephone companies of America. It has hitherto been the Post Office practice to make a charge to capital account in respect of renewals, only if the working capacity of the new plant is greater than that of the plant replaced, and the capital charge is then limited to such portion of the cost as is attributable to the increased capacity. To charge to capital any part of the cost of substituting plant of equal capacity would be a new departure, which we think could only be justified if it were certain that present values would be permanently maintained. In the event of a continued fall in prices, the capital expended might be considerably in excess of the value of the assets representing it. Under this method the excess cost of renewals would be met from Telephone Capital instead of from the annual Vote. We understand, moreover, that the Treasury would be opposed to applying to Parliament for borrowing powers to meet the cost of renewals as distinct from the cost of extending the system.20. Alternatively the plant might be revalued, depreciation being assessed on the current value and the annual contribution from Revenue to the Depreciation Account being proportionately increased. But we consider that until prices have stabilised themselves a valuation is impracticable and would probably be obsolete before it was completed. Moreover this, or any other method, by which Depreciation would be chargeable on the current value of the pre-war plant, appears to us to ignore the important fact that the present generation of telephone subscribers is entitled to the benefit of the lower capital cost of the pre-war plant, which at present comprises the bulk of the telephone system. It is understood that, for the purpose of Income Tax and Excess Profits Duty, the Board of Inland Revenue would not allow a private undertaking to charge Depreciation on the basis of the current value of pre-war plant.21. In view of the complexity of the problem, we thought it expedient to consult Sir William Peat, who has on previous occasions advised the Department on the framing of the commercial accounts and on questions arising upon them, and he has again given us the advantage of his opinion.Sir William. Peat points out that the Depreciation Account set up by a commercial undertaking is intended to provide a fund to replace the original cost of plant at the expiration of its normal life, or, in other words, to preserve the capital intact. Assuming the estimates of the average life of the plant to be accurate, its original cost will have been accumulated in the Depreciation Fund by the time it comes to be renewed and, if the cost of renewal is two or three times the pre-war cost, provided the contribution to the Depreciation Fund is then proportionately increased, its cost will again have been replaced when the life of the renewed plant expires. Sir William Peat therefore recommends that as plant is renewed the annual contribution to the Depreciation Fund in respect of that plant should be raised to correspond with the cost of renewal, but that the contribution on the remaining old plant should -continue to be assessed at the original&apos; rate until that plant in its turn comes to be renewed. It is true that, if prices were to remain permanently at their present level, there would be an increasing drain upon the Depreciation Fund, but having regard to the uncertainty as to the future course of prices, Sir William does not consider it necessary, or indeed fair to the present generation of subscribers, to raise the annual credit to the Depreciation Fund on the whole of the plant, whether ripe for renewal or not, to the level of current costs. On the assumption that prices will ultimately fall, as is generally anticipated, this procedure would lead to an unnecessary inflation of the Depreciation Fund and would throw an undue burden upon present telephone users for the benefit of their successors. If at the end of 5 years, owing to the continuance of high prices, the Depreciation Fund is being unduly depleted, the question may have to be reconsidered and it may then be found that costs are sufficiently stable to justify charging part of the cost of renewals to Capital account.22. We recommend that Sir William Peat&apos;s advice be followed; but inasmuch as the probability of prices falling as far as the pre-war level appears to be remote, we think it reasonable that current Revenue should provide some additional contribution to the cost of future renewals, and we propose that, in addition to the increased allowance for Depreciation corresponding with the replacement of plant at current prices, a special contribution should be made from Revenue to the Depreciation Fund of 200,000L per annum, which for the next 5 years would be equivalent to an
average addition of about 10 per cent, to the Depreciation charge. On this basis it is estimated that the. total charge against the Revenue Account for depreciation, which was 1,471,3201 in 1913-14, will be 2,310,000*. in 1920-21, and will increase by about 325,0001. in each of the following years.23. Pension Liahility.-hi 1913, as the result of an actuarial investigation, the annual contribution from Revenue in respect of Pension Liability was fixed at certain percentages, varying with different grades, of the salaries and wages of the staff employed in the Telephone Service, the hypothetical pension fund being assumed to accumulate at 3 per cent, interest. Since that date the rate of Civil Service pensions has been increased on several occasions concurrently with the War Bonus, and the Treasury have recently agreed that 75 per cent, of the bonus current at the date of retirement shall be included in the pay upon which the pension is calculated. The average rate of bonus for pensionable officers is estimated to be now approxi-mately 113 per cent, of salary, and the average increase in pension will therefore be about 85 per cent. But it is provided that the rate of bonus shall be periodically adjusted to meet increases or decreases in the cost of living, and it follows that the increase in pension will similarly fluctuate. Apart from the question of interest, which is discussed below, we think it is clear that the charge upon Revenue should at present be raised by 85 per cent, to provide for the increased benefits.24. But there would still be a large capital deficiency on the hypothetical pension fund, because the assumed contributions in the past have been insufficient to meet the scale of benefits as now increased. If the fund had to be placed on a solvent basis, it would be necessary to strengthen it by an additional annual contribution from Revenue, either in the form of a terminable annuity or otherwise.The question then arises how far the analogy between the national Telephone Service and a private undertaking can properly be carried. It should be noted that if the rates charged to the public were raised in order to make good the capital deficit in the hypothetical pension fund, the additional revenue so obtained would not be accumulated, but would be paid into the Exchequer and would relieve the taxpayer of the present clay. The object of the commercial accounts is to reflect the financial position of the Telephone Service for the year, and for this purpose it is reasonable that the revenue should be debited, not merely with the actual cost of pensions paid during the year, but with an appropriate charge in respect of the pensions which will eventually mature. But it does not appear to us necessary or expedient that the account should either carry the burden of a past deficiency or be relieved on account of a past surplus. If an attempt were made to preserve the continuity from year to year, which is necessarily maintained in the case of a private undertaking, the Telephone Revenue would tend to grow more and more out of relation to the actual expenditure incurred during the year. Under present conditions the objections to increasing the contribution to the hypothetical pension fund appear to us to be strengthened from the fact that the pension benefits will fluctuate with the cost of living, and it is impossible to forecast what the scale of benefits will be when the prospective pensions, in respect of which the contribution is made, mature for payment. It might happen that, if the cost of living continues to rise the contribution in respect of arrears would have to be increased, while if the cost of living ultimately falls, a valuation of the pension fund might disclose a large surplus which would in theory justify a reduction of rates.It should be noted that a surplus or deficit upon the Telephone Service is not carried forward or capitalised, but is in effect an asset to, or a charge upon, the Exchequer for the year as the case may be.25. A further question arises as to the rate of interest at which the pension fund should be assumed to accumulate. In 1913 the Actuary was instructed to assume a rate of 3 per cent., and in 1918 the Public Accounts Committee, after some discussion of the question, recommended that a 3 per cent, rate should be continued for the present. We think some allowance must be made for the depreciation of the securities, in which the fund would have been invested, and that it would not be reasonable to assume the average rate which first-class securities would yield. But having regard to the fact that the average rate obtainable has for some years exceeded the 3 per cent, allowed, and will probably remain for a considerable period at a very much higher level, it would be reasonable to assume an average rate of 4  per cent, instead of 3 per cent. We understand that the Treasury concur generally
NO REDUCTION IN COST AS DEVELOPMENT PROCEEDS.27. It may be well to anticipate the common criticism that the unit costs of the telephone service may be expected to fall as the system extends, and that the present high prices should be met by stimulating the development of the service instead of by raising the tariff, which will tend to restrict it.Experience, however, shows that there is no net reduction in costs as develop-ment proceeds. Administrative, accounting, and other overhead charges do not, of course, increase in the same ratio as the number of telephones or calls, and further standardisation and mass production may effect some reduction in the cost of particular items of apparatus. It is also true that as the number of lines in an area increases, the unit cost of the line plant tends to fall, since it becomes economical, to replace overhead wires by underground cables carrying large numbers of circuits, with relatively small annual charges for depreciation and maintenance ; and the larger the number of subscribers to be served, the greater becomes the capacity of the cable system which can profitably be laid, and the smaller the average cost per wire in the area.28. But the savings under these heads are neutralised by the increased complexity and cost of the exchange plant and of the operating arrangements which are required to give a large number of subscribers inter-communication with each other. The equipment of a small exchange, which can be worked by one or two operators, is relatively simple and cheap. At a large exchange, the subscribers&apos; lines have to be distributed among many operators, and although each operator has only to answer the calls originated by subscribers in her own group, she must be provided with means, by what is known as &quot; multiple &quot; equipment, to establish connection with any line in the exchange. Thus the cost per line for multiple exchanges of different capacities, each equipped for the average calling rate, would work out in a single-exchange area approximately as follows : For 200 subscribers - - 7&apos; 0 per line.1,000      ,, - - - io-o5,000       ,, - - - 11-2     ,,10,000 - - - 12-329. Again, a populous area requires not one but several large exchanges, between which intercommunication must be provided by means of an elaborate system of junction wires which expands in an increasing ratio as the number of exchanges grows. London, for example, with 150,000 subscribers&apos; lines and. 81 exchanges, requires some 17,000 junction circuits with over .150,000 miles of double wire, while Manchester, with 20,000 subscribers&apos; lines and 23 exchanges, has about 1,850 junction circuits with 8,000 miles of double wire.   Additional switchboards of special typein these proposals, and that on this basis the contribution from revenue in respect of pension liability, which was approximately 400,0007,. in 1913-14, is estimated to amount to 740,000/, in 1920-21.26. The increases under these and other headings will convert the pre-war surplus of between 200,000&apos;/. and 300,000/. into- an estimated deficiency of 3,980,000/. in 1920-21. And, for reasons which we shall explain in greater detail later on, the gradual introduction into the system of an increasing proportion of plant purchased at present prices, whether in the form of renewals or extensions, will tend to swell this deficit year by year so long as costs remain at their existing level.The problem before us is therefore to construct a tariff which, will not only Held the additional Revenue immediately required, but will, either automatically or with simple adjustment, produce an increasing Revenue per unit to meet the rising cost per unit which must be Anticipated in the next few years. The annual expenditure upon the Telephone Service depends so largely upon the prevailing cost of labour and material that under present conditions it is extremely difficult to make a reliable forecast of the future. We have thought it advisable to assume that prices will be maintained substantially at their present level during the next five years, but the rates proposed will be capable of easy modification by a percentage increase or decrease, in the event of any material change taking place.
are required for junction working, and this increases the cost per line for exchanges in a large local area to the following average ligures :  For 200 subscribers        -        -        -    8&apos;0 per line. 1,000      ,, -        -       -  13 25,000      ,, -        -       -  14-610,000      ,, -        -       -  17-0Additional operators have to be provided to serve the junction circuits and, further, the time required to deal with a junction call (and hence the operating cost) is greater than when the call can be completed on the home exchange.Whereas an operator at a large self-contained exchange of modern type could handle the calls from about 147 subscribers&apos; lines, it is necessary, with the same daily number of calls per subscriber, to provide an operator for every 72 lines in a large multi-exchange area, which necessarily has a high proportion of junction traffic.30. Speaking generally the economies in plant construction which accompany development in a&apos;ny area are neutralised by the expenditure which results from the increased complication of the plant and operating methods required to furnish intercommunication. The advantage therefore which the individual subscriber must look for, from the development of the system, lies not in a prospective reduction of his subscription, but in the increase in the number of persons with whom his telephone gives communication.PRINCIPLES OF TELEPHONE TARIFFS.General Remarks.31. Telephone tariffs may be framed on one or other of two broad principles. The total sum which it is necessary to raise may be collected from the several classes of subscribers either (a) in proportion to what the service will hear from the standpoint of subscribers&apos; willingness to pay, or (b) in proportion to the costs involved in giving to each class of subscriber the service required.Up to the present time tariffs both in this and other countries have been based mainly on the former of these principles. Tariffs so framed inevitably lead to certain classes of subscribers being overcharged in order to allow an unremunerative rate to be quoted to other classes whose connection with the system is regarded as desirable. This has resulted in practice in the overcharge of the small user and the undercharge of the large user, partly because the connection of the bigger firms, particularly in the early days of telephone development, seemed desirable as an inducement to others to subscribe to the service.There have been two methods of offering reduced tariffs to large users: (1) the flat rate, i.e., a fixed annual charge covering an unlimited number of local calls, and (2) the measured service rate, i.e., a fixed annual charge for the installation and the sale of local calls in &quot; blocks &quot; at a price decreasing as the number increases.Flat Rates.32. There are at present about 31,000 lines in London and 90,000 in the Provinces rented at &quot; unlimited service&quot; rates. The principle of an unlimited rate would be defensible only if the cost of the service were independent of the number of calls made. But this is not the case. The cost of operating a given number of calls concentrated upon a busy line is no less, and owing to the number of &quot; engaged &quot; calls is usually more, than the cost of operating the same number of calls distributed among a group of small users.&quot; The number of operators depends not upon the number of lines to which each operator has to attend, but upon the number of calls to be handled. Similarly, the extent of the junction line system for obtaining inter-communication between different exchanges and of a large portion of the exchange plant is determined by the volume of traffic^ Increased traffic means increased costs both for plant and operators, but under the flat rate system it yields no additional revenue.33. The telephone subscriber, as a rule, adopts the flat rate only when he finds it cheaper than the message rate, and it follows, if the message rate is fixed at the average cost of a call, that the flat rate subscriber will be contributing less than his share of the cost of the service and that the deficiency must be made good at
tho cost of the small user. Since speaking generally the large users were the first to adopt the telephone service, subsequent development must lie mainly with the smaller users, and these are the very persons whom the flat rate discourages.34. The flat rate system is also a serious obstacle to efficiency, since it offers a direct inducement to the subscriber to overload his line in preference to incurring trie expense of an additional circuit. As the use of a line increases the number of &quot; engaged &quot; calls increases in a rapidly growing ratio. And engaged calls not only cause inconvenience to the public, but impose additional and unnecessary expenditure in operating them. Detailed records taken over a large part of the telephone system have shown that a number of subscribers with only one line are making calls at the rate of over 10,000 a year, whereas the maximum capacity of a line, if its efficiency for inward as well as outward calls is to be unimpaired, is not more than 5,000 outward calls arid an equal number of inward calls a year.Again, under the flat rate system the use of subscribers&apos; telephones by non-subscribers is prohibited. Under the measured or message rate, on the contrary, it is to the interest of the subscribers, the public and the administration alike to encourage the fullest use of the service by all up to the capacity of the lines.35. We are therefore of opinion that the flat rate is wrong in principle, is inequitable as between the large and the small user, and is prejudicial to the efficiency and development of the telephone service. The defects of the system have been recognised abroad, and in America it is being superseded. We recommend that the flat rate should now be entirely abolished in the United Kingdom.Measured Service Rates.36. The measured rate provides cheaper service for the small user while preserving in part the preference enjoyed by the large user under the flat rate. This rate modifies but does not eliminate the fundamental injustices of the flat rate. The sale of calls under a measured tariff is merely prior payment for a number of separate transactions to be completed singly on demand at some future time, and consequently can be compared with the sale of a large number of postage stamps or stamped telegraph forms in one transaction, which does not justify a reduction in the price per stamp or per telegram.As the measured rate, like the flat rate, differentiates unfairly in favour of the large user we recommend that it should also be abolished.Message Rates.(A fixed annual charge for the installation and a uniform charge for each effective local call.)37. The message rate represents the only strictly equitable basis of charging for telephone service. It has the advantage of placing the small and large user on precisely the same footing, inasmuch as each will pay for his service a sum represen-ting the overall cost of providing it.The large user may claim some rebate on the ground that, even though his calls cost the same to operate as those of the small user, yet there is a saving in that one account only has to be kept and rendered, and one sum collected, in respect of his service. This is admitted, but the difference involved is so small that the cost of departure from the uniform rates would more than counterbalance any rebate which could be made.We consider that the telephone tariff should be framed on the general principle that the charges payable by each subscriber should correspond as nearly as possible with the cost of supplying him with the service. The basis of cost ensures the equitable distribution of the expenses of the service, and gives a firm ground on which to resist the claims of particular interests for preferential treatment. But a rigid adherence to this principle without regard to the maximum charges which the various classes of subscribers may be able to bear, might frustrate the object of increasing rates, viz., to obtain additional revenue. We recognise that in some-instances a departure from the strict basis of cost may be justifiable and necessary.For the general tariff we recommend that the message rate system should be adopted. The charge of a uniform fee per call, instead of a scale diminishing as the number of calls purchased increases, represents a departure from the common practice in this country and abroad, but we know of no reason why the preference hitherto allowed to the large user, who in general is more able to bear additional charges, should be continued.   We believe it is not generally appreciated that a
very considerable proportion of the subscribers to the Telephone Service arepersons whose use of the system is extremely small. Detailed records taken in 1913showed that some 36 per cent, of the subscribers in London and 34 per cent, in the Provinces make less than 500 calls per annum.Lines to Private Residences.38. A specially low tariff for residential lines is sometimes advocated, principally with the object of attracting a class of small users who might be deterred by the ordinary charge. The fact that residential traffic is usually spread more evenly over the day than commercial calls tends to reduce operating costs and admits of some saving in switching plant, but on the other hand the average distance of private residences from the exchange is greater than that of business premises, and the line costs are consequently higher. It cannot be maintained that the provision of an installation for a private residence is cheaper than for a business house, and it follows that if the former is supplied below cost price, the deficiency must be made good at the expense of the business subscriber. As the number of residence lines is considerable, an appreciable addition would have to be made to the charge for business lines.We think on the whole that it would be mistaken policy to offer to residential subscribers a preferential rate which is not warranted by the cost of supplying the service, but the recommendation which we have made elsewhere (paragraph 60) in favour of discontinuing the minimum charge for calls, whether made or not, will give relief to the smallest users.BASIS OF TARIFF SUGGESTED.39. The construction of a &quot; message rate &quot; tariff, based on the actual cost of furnishing local telephone service, involves the division of the total expenses into two main portions ; first, the expenses involved in providing the equipment for the individual subscriber, which should be covered by the annual rental charge for his installation, and second, operating and other expenses dependent on the volume of traffic, which should be covered by the local message fees.In the case of the trunk line system, the cost of the whole of the plant as well as the cost of operating must be recouped by the message charges.40. In order to obtain reliable data for the purpose of fixing the tariff, a careful study has been made of the detailed elements of plant, operating, accounting and administrative costs, under both pre-war and present conditions. The increases observed are commensurate with those generally experienced in industrial costs since the war; the following statement shows the percentages by which the present cost, in situ, of the main items of telephone plant, exceeds the pre-war average cost: Local System.--	Proportions of total cost of plant.

Although the cost of extending the system has increased by a very heavy percentage, it is not necessary that the rates charged to the public should be raised in the same proportion at the present time. Telephone subscribers have a right to benefit from the fact that a large amount of plant, installed at a lower cost, is still in existence, and that the rates of interest paid on a considerable proportion of the outstanding capital are lower than those now ruling. Year by year the processes of extension and renewal will introduce into the system an increasing proportion of high-priced plant and of capital bearing high rates of interest, and, failing a notable fall in the level of prime costs, the elfectiye expenses of the service will continue to demand an increasing revenue per unit to meet them.44. A comprehensive revision of the Telephone Tariff is necessarily a laborious and expensive undertaking. It is therefore important that the new Tariff should be so framed as to have a reasonable prospect of remaining undisturbed for the next five years, or as an alternative should be capable of ready adjustment to meet the increased costs.We have therefore kept in view the estimated costs in 1924 in assessing the new rates. We recognise that the future course of wages and plant costs must be a matter of speculation, but we hope that by 1925 prices will have been stabilised at a much lower level. There may, however, be other factors tending in the opposite direction and it appears to us improbable that before that date the costs of the service will have, fallen sufficiently to warrant a downward revision of the Tariff.41. The high rale of increase in the case of local line plant, as compared with trunk line plant, is mainly due to the fact that the adoption, in recent years, of less costly methods of constructing underground plant has made it economical to place much smaller groups of wires underground. In the local exchange system the use of aerial cables, and the erection of pole lines carrying large numbers of wires, has therefore, to a great extent, been abandoned, and the local overhead routes now being constructed usually carry a much smaller number of wires, with a resulting increase in the cost of overhead plant per circuit mile. The network of underground cables has simultaneously been extended into more sparsely telephoned areas than formerly and the result, in this case also, has been an increase in the average cost per circuit mile. This policy, although advantageous in respect of annual charges, has brought about a rise in the average prime costs of both classes of circuits. Its effect upon the average cost of local underground construction in association with that of minor causes, such as pre-war increases in labour rates and in the cost of such important materials as copper and lead represented, in 19.14, an advance of about 09 per cent, beyond the cost per unit of the then existing plant. Present costs are about 120 per cent, above those of 1914, making, as quoted above, an overall advance of 272 per cent, over the average cost of local underground plant in situ.The trunk system, on the other hand, has not been subject to the same conditions. The needs of traffic have, in general, called for cables of the maximum practicable capacity as well as for the continued use of the overhead circuits, while advances in technical construction have introduced economies which have to some extent masked the increases in prime cost experienced since the war.It will be seen that the cost of exchange equipment has also increased, to a very serious extent. This class of plant in urban areas is obtained in the form of complete exchange installations furnished by contractors. The sum of the lowest tenders for exchanges ordered during the first four months of the present year is 199,3501. The estimated pre-war cost of the same plant is 71,900/. The increase in price therefore averages 177 per cent., as quoted, above.42. The annual charges on the plant as a whole have risen as below : 
45. It is estimated that for tho five years 1920 to 1924, inclusive, the value of new plant built into the telephone system will be approximately as below : 	Local System.

On the values thus obtained the annual charges for interest and depreciation, upon which the proposed rates are based, have been assessed.46. The results, representing the actual cost of providing the service, are as follows: Local System.--	London.	Provinces.Annual Installation Costs.

It will be noticed that while the annual installation cost in the Provinces is rather higher than in London, the cost of a local message is rather more than a farthing lower in the Provinces than in London. There is, however, a decided practical advantage in. the adoption of a uniform message fee throughout the entire system. Such uniformity enables the tariff for short trunk circuits to be so graded that it will at all points represent an exact multiple of the fee for a local call. This is an important consideration, since it makes it possible to secure marked economy in the recording of calls-especially short distance calls-by the

The shape of the present London area is irregular and irrational (vide map, Appendix V.); in some directions it extends over 20 miles from the City and in others less than 12 miles. It includes Reigate on the south and Tilbury on the east and several essentially rural districts.50. We recommend that in future the London telephone area should comprise exchanges within a circle of 10 miles radius, having Oxford Circus for its centre. This area contains the populous districts and a large proportion of the suburban exchanges within the present London area, but as a result of this proposal Provincial rates become applicable to over 6,000 subscribers at present-paying London rates.Subscribers within the new London area will pay the higher annual subscription recommended in paragraphs 47 and 48, but, on the other hand, they will obtain certain advantages in the distance covered by the local call fee which are explained in the following paragraphs. Inclusion or exclusion from the new London area will not affect the service given to individual subscribers in the outlying portions of the present area. They will still be able to obtain communication with inner London without the intervention of the Trunk Exchange, and the service will be operated in the same manner as at present.BASIS OP MEASUREMENT FOR TRUNK AND LOCAL CALLS.51. Telephone calls are at present divided into three classes:-(1) Trunk calls, i.e., calls between exchanges situated in different &quot;trunk areas.&quot; The trunk areas (554 in number) were not fixed on any scientific principle, but originated, as we have already explained, in theo 12148 badoption of electrical registration. Conditions are already such that appreciable reduction in the cost of providing the service can be effected in this way, and there is good reason to believe that the point will assume greater importance with future developments in the technical mechanism of telephony. For example, it would not otherwise be possible to develop a full automatic exchange system beyond the area covered by the local unit fee, and it is felt to be wrong in principle that the message charges should be so framed as to impede such developments. We therefore recem-mend that a uniform message fee of 1-kl. be charged in London and in. the Provinces, and that the slight resulting overcharge to the provincial subscriber be made good by a compensating reduction in his annual Installation Rental. We consider that the cost of allowing the extended areas of intercommunication1 at unit fee, proposed for London and the four next large cities (see paras. 54, 55, and 56), may also be appropriately met by adjustments of the Installation Rental.48. The charges which we recommend are  (a) for an exclusive exchange line: 
fact that the operations of the telephone companies were restricted to specified areas, the lines connecting them being controlled by the Post Office. The trunk fee, which is payable in addition to the local fee, is calculated upon the distance between the trunk centres of the two trunk areas concerned, and at present is id. for each 25 miles up to 100 miles, with an extra Sd. for each additional 40 miles or fraction thereof, subject to certain exceptions in the case of calls between neighbouring exchanges in adjacent areas.(2) Junction calls, i.e., calls between exchanges situated in the same trunk area. Calls between exchanges within two miles of each other are usually treated as local calls. For longer distances a junction fee, usually Id up to 8 miles and 2d. up to 10 miles, is charged in addition to the local fee.(3) Local calls, i.e., calls to a subscriber on the same exchange or upon one of several neighbouring exchanges grouped for this purpose.52. This system produces numerous anomalies. The exchanges are not grouped on any uniform or equitable principle, and junction fees are often chargeable for distances which do not exceed those covered in other cases by local fees. Again, some of the trunk lines are shorter than the longer junction circuits, but the fees charged for their use are considerably greater than the appropriate junction fee. The practice of basing the trunk charge upon the distance between the two trunk centres concerned, instead of between the two local exchanges, results in the charge being in some instances greater and in others less than the fee warranted by the actual distance, eg., the fee (4c/.) for a call between Aylesbury and London (37 miles) is calculated on the distance between Chesham and London (25 miles), while the fee (Sd.) between Hastings and Ashford (23 miles) is calculated on the distance between Hastings and Canterbury (34 miles).53. To put an end to these conditions, we recommend that the distinction between trunk and junction calls should be abolished and that all charges for calls should be based on distance. The local fee should cover communication with any exchange within a radius of five miles of the originating exchange and the trunk and junction charges should be merged in a uniform mileage scale, advancing by defined steps and so graduated that the charge for any distance is a multiple of the local fee. For reasons already explained, this is an important consideration.54. London requires special consideration. A large number of exchanges are situated in the central area, and if the five-mile radius, measured from each exchange, were strictly applied, a large proportion of the traffic between one London exchange and another would be charged for as trunk calls. At present communication between all the exchanges in the County of London is obtainable for the local fee; the operators have to remember only what exchanges in the London telephone area are outside the County boundary and the necessary record is made mechanically by depressing a key once or twice as the case may be. If the trunk tariff were applied without modification the operator would have to remember what exchanges were within 5 miles, within 1\ miles, and over 7f miles, respectively, from the particular exchange at which she happened to be working at the moment and she would have to make out a ticket for each call beyond the 1\ miles radius. Frequent reference would be necessary to a list of exchanges, and this, combined with the making out of tickets for all calls beyond the 1\ miles radius, would reduce the speed of operating so that more operators would be needed. The transfer of operators for short periods from one exchange to another would be impracticable; accounting costs would be increased and errors in charging would be frequent.55. In order to minimise these difficulties we propose that, for the purpose of calculating the fees for calls (a) between any two London exchanges and (b) between London exchanges and exchanges not more than. 30 miles from the centre of London, the area enclosed in a circle of 5 miles radius from Oxford Circus should be treated as a single point. The effect of this proposal, coupled with the provision that all exchanges will have a local fee radius of 5 miles, will be that (a) all exchanges within 5 miles of the centre will have intercommunication at the local fee with all exchanges within 10 miles of the centre ;(?)) all exchanges more than 5 miles and not more than 10 miles from the centre will have intercommunication at the local fee with all exchanges within a 5 mile radius and with all exchanges within 5 miles of the centre ;
348(c), calls between exchanges, both of which arc more than 5 miles, but not more than 10 miles from the centre, will be charged either on the direct distance between the exchanges, or on the sum of the distances to the nearest points on the 5 miles circle, whichever is the less. (In many cases the local fee will cover these calls);(d) calls in both directions between London exchanges (le., exchanges within the 10 mile circle) and exchanges not more than 30 miles from the centre will be charged either on the direct distance between the exchanges, or on the sum of the distances to the nearest points on the 5-miles circle, whichever is the less.56. The same conditions obtain, though in a less marked degree, in Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool, and Manchester, and we recommend that the area within a circle of two miles radius from a central point in each of these cities should similarly be treated as a point for calculating the fees on local and short distance trunk calls. The , local fee will therefore cover calls between any exchange in the central area and any exchange within seven miles of the centre.57. In order to obviate differences of charge for long distance calls to or from exchanges within 5 miles of the centre in London and to or from exchanges within 2 miles of the centre in the other four large cities, we recommend that, for the purpose of fixing the trunk fee, the distance be measured from the central point in all cases where it exceeds 30 miles.SEPARATE LOCAL AND TRUNK ACCOUNTS.58. Separate commercial accounts of the trunk and local exchange services are at present compiled and published annually. If the system described in the preceding paragraphs is adopted, the separate trunk account must be either considerably modified or altogether abandoned. There is at present a definite, though often illogical, line of demarcation between trunk calls on the one hand and local and junction calls on the other. If the distinction between trunk and junction calls is abolished and the fee is determined solely by distance, it would be necessary to fix some arbitrary limit., such as 20 miles, beyond which a call would be classified as a trunk call for the purpose of the account. It would be impracticable to separate the revenue and expenditure properly assignable to calls over shorter distances, which are usually worked by means of the same plant and the same staff, and are recorded by the same meters as local calls. Even as regards the long distance calls, the tendency of modern organisation is to amalgamate the trunk and local exchanges and to utilise the same plant and the same staff for all purposes. If separate accounts were maintained they would have to be based to an increasing extent on estimates and apportionments and would become more and more liable to error.The practical value claimed for the separate trunk account consists mainly in the check which it affords upon the sufficiency or otherwise of the charges, taken as a whole, which are made for the use of the trunk service. But an account which covers all calls from 20 miles up to 600 miles is of little use as a guide to the appropriate fees for calls of varying distances, and we are of opinion that the separate account is not worth the labour and expense incurred in preparing it.59. We recommend, therefore, that the trunk account should be discontinued, but that a detailed examination should be made from time to time of the revenue and expenditure proper to a number of representative long distance circuits of various lengths. We believe that a system of costings on these lines will afford a far more valuable index of the suitability of the charges than the present trunk account.MINIMUM USER.60. Under the tariffs in force, both in this country and abroad, the measured or message rate subscriber is usually required to pay, either in addition to or as part of his annual rental, for a minimum number of calls, even if they are not actually used. For example, in London the annual subscription includes 30s. for 360 calls and the Provincial &quot; B &quot; tariff of 6Z. covers 500 calls.The minimum charge for calls has been justified on the ground that each sub-scriber entails some operating expense for what may be termed &quot; readiness to serve,&quot; however few maybe the calls which he originates. But, as we have already explained, the number of operators is determined by the number of calls and not by the number of lines, and we think the additional operating costs, if any, in respect of subscribers whose calls in fact fall below the minimum may be regarded as negligible.  If theb 2
principle which we have recommended elsewhere, that the annual rental should cover all costs properly chargeable to the subscriber^ installation, be approved, we consider that the minimum charge for calls might safely be abandoned. This course would simplify accounting, would conform to the principle that calls should be charged strictly in accordance with the number made, and would foster development by reducing to a minimum the charge to the small user.MAXIMUM LIMIT OF USER PER LINE.61. Service records show that on the average about 16 per cent, of the originated calls do not mature owing to the called subscribers line being engaged. The cost of operating an &quot;engaged&quot; call is higher than that of an effective call because the operator has to make on the average two or more attempts to complete it. Even if no allowance is made for such extra time, the annual cost of handling &quot;engaged&quot; calls .  (160 millions) exceeds 1,000,0002.It is unnecessary to emphasise the importance of reducing the number of ineffective calls, in the interests of subscribers generally as well as of the economy and efficiency of the Telephone service. In the past, attempts to check the overloading of lines have been made by imposing a limit on the number of originated calls per&apos;line which, could be made for the ordinary fee and charging a considerably higher fee for any calls in excess of that limit. But this remedy does not meet the case where the originated calls are few and the incoming traffic heavy, as for example at railway enquiry offices and theatre box offices, because the renter does not become subject to the penal charge on excess outgoing calls, and he has little inducement from the point of view of self-interest to incur the expense of additional lines.62. The following statement gives statistics of the calls on a number of lines which were known to be overloaded, and the traffic on each has been especially recorded for two periods taken at random. The percentage of &quot; engaged &quot; calls is necessarily subject to wide variations owing to the traffic being in. some instances more concentrated in point of time than in. others, but the results as a whole are significant as showing the waste of time, both to operators and subscribers, caused by overloaded lines and the beneficial results of renting additional circuits: July or September, 1919 Record.

63. Wc recommend that the present system of charging a higher fee for excess calls be abolished and in lieu thereof that the Postmaster-General should take power in the agreements with Telephone subscribers to refuse service to any subscriber who declines to rent a sufficient number of circuits 10 receive at least four-fifths of his incoming calls on demand, that is, to a subscriber on whose lines the number of &quot;engaged &quot; calls exceeds 25 per cent, of the number of effective incoming calls.In order to enforce this condition when it is noticed by the operator that a large number of &quot;engaged&quot; reports are being received in respect of any subscriber, a record of all calls to that subscriber will be taken at a special position where the number of effective and ineffective calls will be registered separately over a period of not less than one week (i.e., 5^ working days).SUBSIDIARY SERVICES.Auxiliary Lines.64. The proposal in the preceding paragraph will afford much needed relief in the case of those lines which are seriously overloaded, but the number of engaged calls may still be inconveniently high on many lines, even though*the proportion does not reach the maximum limit of 25 per cent, which we consider would justify the Post Office in insisting upon the provision of an additional line. It is desirable in the interests of subscribers generally, and of the service itself, to keep the proportion of engaged calls as far as possible below this maximum, and in order to induce a subscriber whose line is busy, though not necessarily loaded to the limit of its capacity, to provide additional facilities, we recommend that auxiliary lines, i.e., second and subsequent lines which can be used as alternative channels for incoming calls, should be supplied at a rental less by 11. per annum than the amount paid for the original circuit. It is calculated that this reduction will be made good by the saving in the cost of operating ineffective calls.Extra Mileage Charges.65. At present the normal subscription covers the provision of the installation within one mile of the nearest exchange in the Provinces and within two miles in London. Beyond these distances an &quot;extra mileage&quot; charge is made of 11. 5s. per annum in the Provinces and 11. 15s. in London for each quarter of a mile of circuit or part thereof measured radially from the boundary of the free area up to three miles from the exchange and by route distance for any portion of the circuit extending beyond the three-mile radius. In addition a charge of 7s. Qd. per annum is made for each 220 yards of new pole work required.66. We recommend that the radius covered by the ordinary rental should remain unchanged, and that the special pole-charge should be merged in a uniform extra-mileage rate, which should be calculated radially from the boundary of the free area. The average cost of providing a subscriber^ line is found to be 101. per mile, reckoned on radial distance and the extra-mileage charge should therefore be 11. 5s. per furlong or part thereof. The rental payable by each subscriber will then be determined solely by distance and will not depend upon whether an existing pole line happens to be available, or, if available, upon the particular route which may be most conveniently followed.The rates recommended are already being applied to new subscribers&apos; lines.Party Lines.67. There is at present no party line tariff in London. In the Provinces a two-party line business telephone service is supplied for 51.12s. per annum, covering 500 local calls, and a residence service for 51. per annum, covering 400 calls. There is also a four-party line provincial residence rate of 41. per annum, covering 300 calls. These services have never been popular, since the difference between the rentals of a party-line and an exclusive line is generally considered too small to offset the disadvantages of having to share the use of a line with another subscriber. Primd facie it might appear that the provision of a two-party line service should approximately halve the cost per station, and that proportionate further economy should result from increasing the number of stations per line. In actual fact this is not the case. There is no saving in the subscriber^ station itself, and the small amount of apparatus saved at the exchange is counterbalanced by the additional cost of special arrangements for selectively calling the individual subscribers on the line.   The total wire mileage isa 12448 b 3
on the average considerably greater than that of an exclusive circuit, since the subscribers&apos; premises are not generally adjoining and aro seldom on the same straight line of route. The cost of operating calls from party lines exceeds, by some 20 per cent., that incurred in operating exclusive lines, and a further loss of revenue arises from the fact that removals and recoveries of subscribers&apos; installations introduce appreciable periods when one subscriber only is actually served by a two-party line.08. The cumulative effect of these factors is that the total rental which should be payable by each two-party line subscriber within one mile of tho exchange is only 11. 10s. per annum less than that payable for an exclusive line, and, in view of the disadvantages and inconvenience involved, we do not consider it advisable to offer a tariff based on this difference. Beyond a one-mile radius, however, where extra mileage rates are payable, the factor of lino cost rises sufficiently to make the economy of sharing a line in some measure compensate for the inconvenience introduced, and it is therefore proposed to offer a two-party line tariff&apos; to subscribers so situated. The annual rental will therefore be 6Z., plus extra mileage at the rate of 12s. GtZ. per furlong per annum (i.e. half the normal rate) for each subscriber in respect of that portion of the line used in common by both subscribers. Extra mileage used exclusively by one subscriber will be charged at the normal rate of 11. 5s. per furlong.The four-party line involves still greater inconvenience than the two-party line, both to the subscriber and to the Post Office, while line saving is further discounted by additional complications in apparatus and operating. This service has been very little used, and it is not proposed to continue it.Rural Party (Farmers&apos;) Lines.69. A form of party line service which we consider worthy of retention and development is the system of long multi-station lines established in rural areas where the cost of installing systems in accordance with the general standard would be prohibitive. Such rural lines, often referred to as &quot; Farmers&apos; lines,&quot; fulfil a useful function in linking up outlying dwellings and farms with the nearest market towns and with centres whence medical aid can be summoned in emergency, and where the rural subscribers can get into touch with the telegraph system. These rural party lines must, however, be regarded as essentially local in their range of communication, and not as forming part of the national system by which the urban and industrial portions of the country are telephonically united. The grade of transmission efficiency which can be economically furnished on such lines is only sufficient to provide com-munication with neighbouring large towns, and with a limited portion of the general trunk system.The apparatus employed is comparatively simple, and involves the use of code calls which can be recognised by the particular subscriber wanted. It is proposed to continue the existing limit of twelve subscribers per line and to charge a rental of il. when there are three or more subscribers to the mile and il. 10s. when less than three, to include unlimited service.These rates are insufficient to cover a full share of the general expenses of the telephone system, but the national importance of telephone service to agricultural communities is considered to warrant the concession involved.Extension Instruments.70. The present charge for extensions varies from II. to 21. 12s. per annum per instrument and depends upon the number rented and upon whether facilities for intercommunication between the several extensions are supplied. The cost of providing and maintaining an instrument, exclusive of the line circuit, is 1/. 6s. per annum, and is not affected by the number of instruments rented by any one subscriber. To this must be added the cost of the internal wiring, which is not considerable, and in some cases the cost of a switchboard or other intercommunicating apparatus, which amounts to about 18s. per annum per line connected.We recommend that the charge for a simple extension should be 11. 10s. per annum, and if facilities for intercommunication are included 21. 5s. per annum. Internal wiring up to a maximum length of 110 yards would be included in both cases.71. For extension instruments situated in a building other than that in which the main instrument is located, an extra mileage charge of 11. 5s. per furlong with a minimum of 21. 10s. should apply up to half a mile. Beyond that distance special difficulties of transmission are met with, requiring special types of apparatus to overcome them, and the rental in these cases should be based on cosfc^
Private Branch Exchanges.72. The needs of the large telephone user, who requires public exchange service from a number of points on his premises as well as intercommunication between those points, are met by the private branch exchange. The minimum amount of apparatus supplied at the private branch exchange tariff is two circuits to the public exchange, together with a switchboard and two extension instruments. The annual sub-scription for this installation is 23Z. in the London telephone area and 17Z. 4s. in Provincial areas, covering in each case 3,000 originated local calls. Additional extensions are charged for at the current rate, and additional calls over and above the original 3,000 are purchased in &quot; blocks &quot; in accordance with the appropriate measured rate tariff.We recommend that the line should be charged for at the ordinary rate and that the rental for each extension instrument connected with a private branch exchange should be the rate of 21. 5s. per annum proposed in the preceding paragraph, which will cover the cost of providing and maintaining a switchboard of the standard type. If a subscriber requires special apparatus or an abnormal number of operators&apos; positions, an extra charge, dependent on the additional cost, should be made.73. The arguments in favour of a reduced charge for each exchange circuit after the first (see paragraph 64) apply equally to private branch exchange lines, and we recommend that a reduction of 11. per annum be made in the rental for second and subsequent exchange circuits.The annual rental of the first line to a private branch exchange will therefore be 8Z. 10s. in London, SI. in the large cities, and 11. 10s. in the Provinces, and the rental for the second and subsequent lines, 11. 10s. in London, 11. in the large cities, add 61. 10s. in the Provinces.   Calls will be paid for at the ordinary rate.Private Telephone Wires.74. The tariffs for private wires have in the past varied considerably. Separate rates were in force for circuits (a) up to-25 miles in length, (b) between 25 and 50 miles, and (c) over 50 miles, and these again differed according to (a) whether the circuits consisted of single or double wire and (6) the nature of the route, i.e., underground, over-house or along road, rail or canal. Again, the charges varied as between London and the Provinces and in some cases were fixed by radial measurement and in others by route distance. The charges, excluding apparatus, ranged from a minimum of 51. per mile for circuits along roads in the&apos; Provinces to 12Z. per mile for circuits in underground cables. We propose that the opportunity should now be taken to introduce a single tariff for private telephone wires to embrace all classes of circuit.From an examination of the cost of providing private wires we have come to the conclusion, that the following rentals will cover the expenses of the line plant whether overhead or underground circuit be provided : Circuits up to 50 miles radial measurement, 11. 15s. a furlong per annum, witha minimum of 31. 10s. Circuits up to 100 miles radial measurement, 11. 17s. M. a furlong per annum. Circuits over 100 miles radial measurement, 21. a furlong per annum.Underground circuits would be provided only where spare wires in existing cables were available. The higher charge per mile for the longer lines is due to the necessity of using heavier wire as the length of the circuit increases.The present charge for telephone instruments connected with private wires varies from 15s. to 21.   We recommend that the rental in future shall be 21.Tie Lines.75. Circuits connecting two private branch exchanges are called &apos;: tie lines.&quot; Communication with the public exchange system by means of tie lines is not permitted, and they are essentially private wires.The present charge for tie lines, including the switchboard terminations, is 41 per annum in London and 21. Ils. per annum in the Provinces for the first quarter of a mile of external wire, and 11. 15s. per annum in London and 11. 5s. per annum in the Provinces for each additional quarter of a mile or part thereof.The annual cost of a circuit used as a tie line is as much as the cost of a private wire, and we therefore recommend that the private wire tariff of 31. 10s. per annum for the first quarter of a mile and 1Z. 15s. per furlong thereafter be applied to tie lines, and that an additional charge of 1Z. per annum be made for internal wiring and switchboard termination at each end.13 4
Public Call Offices.76. The expense of providing and maintaining a public call office is necessarily much greater than that of an ordinary subscribers circuit. The initial cost is higher owing to the provision of silence cabinets and coin collecting boxes ; repairs are heavier owing to rough handling; operating costs are more than double because the telephonist after completing the required connection has to check the insertion of each coin in the money box; painting, cleaning and renovating cabinets, renewal of directories, collecting money from the coin boxes, and in certain cases payment of call office attendants and commission, involve additional charges which are not incurred in maintaining an ordinary line.77. The call office fee was raised in 1915 from 2d. to 3d. in London and from Id. to 2d. in the Provinces. It is calculated that in order to cover the cost of the service under present conditions the fee would have to be not less than hd.The increase imposed in 1915 caused an immediate drop in the number of calls of 30 per cent, in London and 50 per cent, in the Provinces. It is clear that a still heavier reduction must be expected if the fee were raised to hd. People who find the call office a convenience would only resort to it in case of necessity and would often not have the necessary number of pennies available. Allowing for the fall in traffic, the total revenue at the rate of hd. a call would probably not exceed the revenue yielded by the present fees and a large proportion of the plant would be comparatively idle. Moreover, owing to the longer time occupied in inserting and counting the coins, the operating costs would rise still further.78. The public call office fulfils an important function in familiarising the public with the advantages of the telephone service and brings it within reach of a large section of the community who either cannot afford or have not sufficient use for an exclusive line. There are objections to any departure from the general principle that the tariff for each class of service should cover the cost of providing it, but we think that in this instance tho arguments against a substantial increase, and in particular the uncertainty whether any additional revenue would be derived from it, are conclusive. We recommend, however, that the fee should be uniform in London and the Provinces, and we propose that it should be fixed at 3d. for a local call.79. It may be mentioned that, if a single coin of suitable value and size, e.g., a nickel piece, were current, the cost of operating a call office circuit would be no higher than that of operating an ordinary subscribers line. The coin boxes could be so constructed that the operators attention would only be called after the coin had been inserted, and she would be saved the time occupied in waiting for and counting the coins. The expense of clearing the boxes would also be reduced, and it is estimated that with a M. fee the service could be carried on without loss.Charges  or Trunk Calls at Night.80. The present arrangements are that the charge for a six minutes&apos; call between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. is the same as that for a period of three minutes during the day, and that for a three minutes call half the usual day charge is made except that  (1) no reduction is made when the day charge is less than Is.; (2) a reduction of one-third only is made when the day charge is Is. We recommend that similar reductions for night calls shall be made as regards the new trunk charges proposed.Jersey and the Isle of Man.81. The tariffs rat present in force in Jersey are considerably lower than the ordinary provincial tariffs, and include unlimited service for 6L 10s. and a message rate of 11. 10s. for line rental plus Id. per call.In the Isle of Man the provincial measured &quot; A &quot; tariff is the current rate, but more than half the subscribers have unlimited service for sums varying from hi. to 10LAn investigation of the costs of the systems in these islands shows that plant, operating and office costs are as high as the average costs for the rest of the Provinces. WTe therefore recommend that the charges for service in these islands should be the same as elsewhere.Continuous Service.82. It is the general rule to give continuous telephone service throughout the twenty-four hours and on Sunday, except in the case of small exchanges where the cost
351of attendance at night and on Sunday would be excessive. A special charge of 10s, or 11. is made at small exchanges in areas in which the lower minimum rental (Tariff k) is in force. As the same tariff will apply in future to all subscribers in the Provinces, we recommend this special charge should be abolished. There is, however, increasing difficulty in arranging for continuous attendance when new exchanges are proposed in rural districts for the benefit of a few subscribers; and we think it reasonable to impose a special charge in such cases, if the cost is considerably in excess of the standard rates.Minor Charges.83. There are a number of minor charges for the use of such apparatus as &quot;Coin Collecting Boxes,&quot; &quot;Plugs and Sockets,&quot; &quot;Buzzers,&quot; &amp;c, which will have to be adjusted to meet current costs.Abolition of Surcharge.84. A uniform surcharge of 41. on new telephone installations is at present made pending the introduction of a revised telephone tariff.We recommend that with the introduction of the telephone tariffs herein defined this surcharge be abolished.SUBSCRIBERS&apos; ACCOUNTS.85. Up to the present it has been the general rule to require prepayment of tele-phono charges. The rental is paid annually in advance by all subscribers. In the case of Measured and Message rate subscribers it covers only a limited number of calls, and each subscriber is required to purchase a fresh &quot; block of calls &quot; as soon as those in hand are nearing exhaustion. Accounts are rendered monthly in arrear for trunk and junction calls and for telegrams dictated over subscribers&apos; circuits; but any subscriber who makes more than occasional use of these facilities is required to deposit a sum equal to the average amount of his monthly account, and to increase the deposit if his user increases.For a long time past it has been recognised that this system is unsatisfactory both to the public and to the Post Office. In addition to the annual account for rental and the monthly account for trunk charges, the subscriber receives frequent demands for the purchase of additional calls or for increased deposits; although he has a substantial balance to the credit of his local fee account, he may be asked to make an additional payment for trunk calls aid vice versa and may be temporarily deprived of the service if he omits to comply. From the point of view of the Post Office the system is complicated and expensive ; it involves keeping a continual watch upon the debits raised against each subscriber, besides the issue of a large number of separate accounts and the receipt, acknowledgment, and bringing to account of numerous small remittances. &apos;We believe also that the necessity of paying the whole of the annual rental in advance imposes a considerable burden upon the smaller users and that a system, by which the charge would be spread more evenly ovet the year, would be generally welcomed.86. We therefore asked a sub-committee of officers experienced in telephone accounting to examine the possibility of substituting a single account for all services, to be rendered at quarterly intervals. They reported that such a system would be practicable and economical provided the charge for local calls is uniform for all subscribers. Under the proposals submitted in paragraph 37 this condition will be fulfilled, and we recommend the adoption of the following scheme.The accounts of all subscribers will be made up on 1st January, 1st April, 1st July, and 1st October, and the majority will be sent out in the third week of the month. Each account will include one quarters installation rental (21.2s. Qd. in London, 21. in the four large cities, and 1Z. 17s. Qd. elsewhere in the Provinces) in advance, and all fees incurred during the preceding quarter for local and trunk calls, and for telegrams. As this will involve giving credit for all charges except the installation rental, it is proposed to require from each subscriber a deposit to the extent of two-thirds of his average quarterly account for calls, with a minimum of 11. 10s.87. Many large users of the trunk and telegraph services will probably prefer monthly accounts and monthly payments for these services in order that they may be in a better position to check the charges, and also to obtain the advantage of a reduced deposit. Any departure from the regular system occasions some additional expense, but we think that monthly accounts for these charges should be allowed on payment of a fee of 4s. a year, the deposit being reduced so as to include two-thirds of the average charges for a month instead of a quarter in respect of trunk calls and telegrams.
New subscribers will be required on the completion of their installation to pay the minimum deposit of 11. 10s., together with proportionate rental up to the next quarter day. The deposit will be increased if necessary when the amount of the first account for a complete quarter is known.With a quarterly system, prompt settlement of accounts may reasonably be expected, and we recommend that payment within seven days should be asked for, that on the fourteenth day a reminder should be sent threatening disconnection in default of payment, and that on the fifth day after the date of the reminder the service should be withdrawn if the account is still outstanding.88. The adoption of the system described in the preceding paragraphs will remove the annoyance caused by the receipt of telephone accounts at frequent and irregular intervals, and the relief afforded by quarterly payments will, we are convinced, be an important factor in retaining existing subscribers or attracting new subscribers, who might otherwise be deterred by the increased charges. The number of first accounts (i.e., excluding reminders) will be reduced from about 5,000,000 to 2,000,000 per annum, accounting will be simplified and it is estimated that an annual saving of 40,0001. per annum in clerical staff will be secured.89. On the other hand, the average balance of advance payments in the hands of the Post Office will be very much smaller, with the result that the interest upon that balance for which the telephone service obtains credit will be reduced and there will also be a considerable deficiency of Revenue paid into the Exchequer in the transition year. The loss of interest will be recurrent, and is estimated at 132,0001. per annum after allowing for the increased deposits for trunk and local fees (900,000/.) which will be required. This loss of interest will in part be set off by the saving in clerical and accounting costs, and allowance has been made for a net loss of 100,000/. in our estimates of the future cost of the service.90. The deficiency of Revenue in the transition year, which is estimated at 3,500,000/. on the basis of the existing rates, less 900,000/. for additional deposits, arises from the fact that in that year, instead of a full year&apos;s rental, the subscriber will pay only one, two or three quarters according to the incidence of his previous rental date. We recognise that this deficiency, even though non-recurrent, is a serious factor, but if the system of payment is to be placed on a simple and intelligible basis, the first essential is that the accounting periods for all classes of telephone service should be the same. The only alternative to reducing the proportion of rental paid in advance would be to increase the deposits for local and trunk fees to cover a full year, which we think may for obvious reasons be dismissed t as impracticable. WTe believe that a reform on the lines which we propose will sooner or later be inevitable, and in view of die economy in accounting and adminis-trative expenses, we hope the temporary shortage of Revenue may not be regarded as an insuperable obstacle to the i-new system. We desire to point out that the imposition of increased rates is an opportune moment to bring in the change of system, both from the point of view of the public and of the administrative work involved.APPLICATION OF THE REVISED TARIFF.91. At the present time subscribers&apos; agreements run from the date on which the service was first given, known as the &quot; due date,&quot; and rental for the whole installation and for the minimum number of calls or ordinary user is payable annually in advance on that date. When an addition or alteration is made after the due date, propor-tionate rental is collected up to the next due date. In anticipation of the revision of-tariff, agreements of obsolete form requiring more than three months&apos; notice are being replaced by fresh agreements, and by 1st July 1920 all existing agreements which have run a year will be terminable by three months&apos; notice, ending at the due date or three, six or nine months therefrom. All new agreements signed after 21st June 1920 will be terminable at the end of three, six or nine months.92. As a preliminary to the introduction of a revised tariff, it will be necessary to terminate over half a million existing agreements, and the notices will be despatched during a period of three months in the order of the due dates of the agreements. For example, if the new tariff is approved early in August, the despatch of notices could begin with the subscribers wdiose due dates are 1st September, 1st December, 1st March and 1st June, and could end about the middle of November with those whose due dates are 30th November, 28th February, 31st May and 31st August. i In that event the new tarilf would be introduced on the 1st of December 1920, beginning with the subscribers whose due dates are the 1st of December, 1st of March,
35295. We estimate that the financial effect of the tariff recommended in this Report will be as follows: Financial Year.	Expenditure.	Itcvenue.	Balance. Surplus (4-) or Deficit (-).1921-22       ...... 1922-23       -     -1923-24       -      -     -      -1924-25	  15,200,000 . 16,700,000 18,400,000 20,200,000	  16,000,000 17,300,000 18,600,000 19,700,000	  -\- 800.000 -\- 600,000 + 200,000 - 500,000This estimate has been based on the following hypotheses :  (a) that the new tariff will be introduced towards the end of 1920-21 and will be fully operative by the 1st April 1921; (b) in normal times the rate of development of the Telephone service is nearly 10 per cent, per annum.   In view of the considerable. arrears to be made good arising from the suspension of construction works during the war, a higher rate of development might be anticipated if the present tariff were maintained, but to allow for the check which the higher charges will probably cause we have assumed an increase of 5 per cent, per annum in the number of lines from 1920-21 onwards; (c) the higher message fee and the abolition of the flat rate will restrict the number of calls, especially in the first two years, and we have therefore assumed the following reductions in the calling rates : 			Year.	Flat Rate Subscribers.	Limited Rate Subscribers.	Trunk Calls.1921-22 1922-23 1923-24	Per Cent. 25 15 5	Per Cent. 10 5     -	. Per Cent. 5/1st of Juno and 1st of September, and it would apply universally by the 28tli of February 11)21, with, the exception of a small number of subscribers connected after the 29th of February 1920, whose agreements must run for a complete year from the due date.Under the system of quarterly accounts described in paragraphs 85-90 the installa-tion rental will be payable quarterly in advance, and trunk and local fees quarterly in arrear, on the 1st January, 1st April, 1st July and 1st October. The first accounts under the new system would therefore be made up on the 1st January 1921, in the case of subscribers whose agreements terminated during December 1920, ix., roughly one-third of the whole, and on the 1st April 1921 in the case of all other subscribers, except those connected after the 31st March 1920.93. The first quarterly account sent to each subscriber will include one quarters installation rental in advance, a proportionate rental for any broken period between the date of termination of the agreement and the first day of the ensuing quarter, and all local and trunk fees incurred up to the date of the account. It will also include the deposit referred to in paragraph 86, credit being given for any deposit already held. Credit will be given for any unexpired portion of rental (including the minimum payment for fees) paid under the old agreement. A. record, will he made of the calls made by each subscriber up to the date of the termination of his agreement, and where calls, purchased in excess of the minimum, are unused on that date, credit will be given in the first quarterly account.94. The new scale of trunk fees can be introduced in advance of the date fixed for the introduction of the exchange line tariff, and can be applied at once to all calls which are known at present as &quot; trunk calls,&quot; i.e., calls from one area to another. The subscribers&apos; agreements specify the fees for what are now known as &quot; junction calls,&quot; calls within an area for which a charge is made in addition to the ordinary local message fees, and as regards these the new scale can only be applied to each subscriber when his old agreement terminates.FINANCIAL SUMMARY.
rTELEPHONE CHARGES IN THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES IN EUROPE AND IN THELARGER CITIES IN AMERICA.96. New telephone charges have been introduced in all the principal countries of Europe since 1914. For reasons which can easily be appreciated, they have without exception represented substantial increases ; in some cases rates have been raised by more than one hundred per cent. In many countries two revisions have occurred within the last five years; in others, in addition to an increased rate, a substantial installation charge has been levied for the first time, or the existing installation charge has been increased. In others, again, a surcharge has been made, sometimes as a preliminary and sometimes as an annual charge.97. The present rates in Europe and America are set out in some detail in Appendix III., and a table is given in Appendix IV. showing the cost at certain rates of user in some of the largest cities.98. It is always difficult to institute accurate comparisons between the telephone charges of one country and another. Apart altogether from economic considerations, such as the value of money and the cost of labour and material in different States, the charges themselves are not easily comparable, being based on no common unit and graded in different methods and by widely varying degrees. Even a simple flat rate does not always afford a basis of comparison between two countries, for one may require an installation charge or the provision of the apparatus by the su bscriber, and the other neither. With measured rates, again, the initial charges may cover such widely disparate numbers of calls as to render comparison profitless. The distance from the exchange beyond which a charge is made for additional mileage also varies considerably; but for the sake of brevity extra mileage charges have been omitted from the tables in the appendix.Two important considerations have to be taken into account in comparing rates, namely, the period during which the service is available and the number of persons with whom the subscriber can communicate without any charge beyond the fee for a local call. Continuous day and night service is practically universal in Great Britain and in the system of the Bell Companies of America, and its advantages are justly prized and jealously maintained in these countries, although it involves an expenditure out of proportion to the number of calls made at night and on Sunday. But in Europe continuous service is confined to a few of the larger towns, generally those in which a chief telegraph office would be open night and day, and elsewhere the service is available only from 8 o&apos;clock in the morning to 8 or 9 at night.99. In considering trunk telephone rates, it is to be remembered that in several European countries where these rates are low, special &quot; urgent&quot; rates are in force. In some countries at least the pressure on the trunk lines gives the non-urgent call little chance of reasonably early transmission, and the urgent rate tends to become the normal rate ; in other words, the rate for trunk calls may in practice be three times as high as would appear from the ordinary table of charges.SUMMARY OP RECOMMENDATIONS.100. The following is a summary of our principal conclusions and recom-mendations: (1) At the outbreak of the war the Telephone Service, after providing for interest on capital, showed a fair margin of profit, which, under normal conditions, the rates then charged would have been sufficient to maintain.(d) it is assumed lor the purpose of this Report that prices will remain at their present level.It will he seen that as time goes on and the proportion of post-war plant increases, expenditure will rise at a more rapid rate than revenue, and the initial surplus will consequently he converted into a growing deficit. We hope that this process may be counteracted by a gradual reduction in prices, but if this reduction does not materialise or is not sufficiently rapid, we recommend that a percentage addition be made to the account of each subscriber, sufficient to keep the service on a remunerative basis, and power to make this addition should be included in new agreements with subscribers.
(2) Between 1913-14 and 1920-21 the expenditure, on the basis of the Commercial Accounts, has risen from slightly under 6,000,000?. to 13,700,000?. Of this increase, salaries and wages account for 5,700,000?., of which 4,210,000?., or 74 per cent, is due to War Bonus. Depreciation is higher by 840,000?., the charge for Pension liability by 340,000?., and Interest by 330,000?. In the same period the Revenue has risen from 6,200,000?. to 9,700,000?., and there is therefore an estimated deficit of nearly 4,000,000?.(3) As the system is gradually extended and renewed with plant purchased at current prices, the expenditure per unit will tend to rise year by year, and will require a growing revenue to meet it.(4) In order to distribute the cost of the Telephone Service equitably among those who use it, the rates should, as far as possible, be fixed in propor-tion to the cost of giving each class of subscriber the service required.(5) The Flat or Unlimited Service rate gives an undue preference to the large as against the small user, encourages the overloading of lines and in other ways tends to restrict the development of the system. It should therefore be abolished. The &quot; Measured Rate,&quot; under which the charge per call is reduced as the number of calls used increases, is also open to the objections of undue preference, though in a less degree.(6) The Message rate, i.e., a fixed annual charge for the installation and a uniform charge for each effective local call, is the most equitable and at the same time the most convenient method of charge, and should be adopted as the basis of the general tariff.(7) The cost of supplying the Telephone Service to private residences and to business premises is the same and the same rates should therefore apply.(8) An investigation of the cost of providing the service in 1924 on the hypothesis that the, present level of prices is maintained, gives an installation cost&apos;of 7&apos;5?. in London and 8&apos;23?. in. the Provinces and message costs of 1 &apos;65d. in London and 1 &apos;38ci in the Provinces.(9) It is important that the message fee should be uniform throughout the country and a charge of l\d. per call is recommended. The annual installation rental should be 8?, 10s. in London, 8?. in Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester, and 7?. 10s. elsewhere. The London rates should apply to subscribers connected with exchanges within 10 miles of Oxford Circus. The lower charges in the Provinces and the great cities are justified by the fact that the radius covered by the local fee in London is greater and, as regards the Provinces, the message costs are somewhat lower than the actual fee proposed while in London they are slightly higher.(10) The local fee should cover communication with any exchange within 5 miles of the originating exchange. For calls in excess of this distance, the junction and trunk fees should be merged in a uniform mileage scale.(11) To meet the special position of London, the area within a 5 mile radius from Oxford Circus should be treated as a single point for the purpose of cal-circulating the fees for calls (a) between two London exchanges and (b) between London exchanges and exchanges not more than 30 miles from the centre of London. Similarly in Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester, the area within a 2 mile radius from the centre should be treated as a point for this purpose.(12) With a view to reducing the number of &quot; engaged &quot; calls due to overloaded lines, the Postmaster-General should take power to refuse service to any subscriber on whose lines the number of &quot;engaged&quot; calls exceeds 25 per cent, of the number of effective incoming calls, if he refuses to rent an additional circuit. ,(13) In order to encourage the renting of relief circuits, the charge for an auxiliary line should be 1?. per annum less than the charge for the original circuit.(14) The minimum charge at present imposed for calls, whether made or not should be discontinued.
(15) The public Call Office fee should be 3d. both in London and the Provinces. This charge will not in itself be remunerative, but it is improbable that any higher charge would yield additional revenue; any further increase in the number of pennies required for a single call would cause incon-venience to the public as well as operating difficulties.(16) In view of the higher charges, we recommend that subscribers should he given the facility of settling their accounts quarterly in future instead of being required to pay annually in advance as at present.(17) It is estimated that on the foregoing basis the telephone accounts will show a surplus of 800,0007, in 1921-22, of 600,0001. in 1922-23, of 200,0007. in 1923-24 and a deficit of 500,0007. in 1924-25.101. We desire to record our obligations to the Secretaries to the Committee. Owing to Mr. Crawford&apos;s absence on sick leave during a considerable part of the enquiry, the burden of the secretarial work has fallen mainly on Mr. Weston, whose ability and intimate knowledge of the Telephone Service have been invaluable to us.G.

REPORT.The Select Committee appointed to examine the Present Charges made to the Public for the use of the Telephone Service and to report in what respects those Charges require Revision in order to place tho Service on a Remunerative Basis : Have agreed to the following Retort.1. In 1919 the Postmaster-General appointed a Departmental Committee &quot;to consider and report what alterations in the existing telephone tariffs arc expedient, with special reference to the necessity of placing the Telephone Service on a remunerative basis.&quot; The Report of that Committee, dated June 30th, 1920, formed tho basis of the present inquiry, and was printed as a Command Paper (804).2. The limitations imposed on your Committee by the restricted Terms ol Reference precluded inquiry into tho efficiency of tho Telephone Service, except in so far as economy is the result of efficiency; but the users&apos; point of view was put before them by such large and representative bodies as the Association of British Chambers of Commerce, the Federation of British Industries, the London Chamber of Commerce, and others much of the evidence being of a critical charactsr.3. The following is a brief history of the Telephone Service from 1880, when it was held by the Courts that a telephone is a telegraph Avithin the meaning of the Telegraph Acts and that telephone communication required the licence of the Postmaster General. Licences expiring on December 31st, 1911, were granted to various Companies, but the National Telephone Company, which acquired the original telephone patents, succeeded in buying up or extinguishing its rivals, and secured a virtual monopoly. The master patents expired in 1890 and 1891, and effective competition then became possible. In 1890, under an Act passed four years previously, the Post Office purchased the Trunk Wire system of the National Telephone Company, the operations of that Company being thenceforward restricted to local exchange areas. In 1899 the Postmaster-General granted telephone licences to the States of Guernsey and to thirteen municipalities, and announced that the Post Office woliIcI establish a local exchange system in London. Municipal systems were actually established at Brighton, ,Glasgow, Hull, Portsmouth, Swansea, and Tunbridge Wells; but after a short trial all these, except Hull, sold out either to the Post Office or the National Telephone Company.In 1901 the Post Office and the Company agreed to charge the same rates in London and to give free inter-communication between the&apos; tAvo systems, and settled the terms for the ultimate purchase of the Company&apos;s London&apos;system when its licence expired at the end ol 1911.The first Post Office exchange in London (Central Exchange) was opened on March 1st, 1902. In 1905 the Postmaster-General and the Company signed an agreement fixing the conditions of purchase of the whole of the Company&apos;s undertaking in 1911, and on January 1st, 1912, the whole Telephone Service of the United Kingdom passed into the hands of tlu State, with the exception of tha local system at Portsmouth which was transferred on October 1st, 1913, and of the local systems which still remain the property of the municipality of Hull and of the States of Guernsey,The following figures shew the position of the National Telephone Company at the time of the transfer in 1911: The Issued Capital consisted ol: 15,000 Six Per Cent. 1st Pref. Shares of  10 each 15,000 Six Per Cent. 2nd Pref. Shares of  10 each    -250,000 Five Per Cent, 3rd Pref.

Debenture Stock.....10,683,780The Dividend on the Deferred Stock varied from time to time. During the five years ending December, 1911, the Company paid 6 per cent, on the Deferred Stock. Prior to 1907, the rate was 51 per cent., 5 per cent., 4  per cent., etc.The Company&apos;s original claim for its plant, property and assets amounted to nearly  21,000,000, but was subsequently amended to  18,350,000. The amount ultimately awarded by the Arbitrators-the Railway and Canal Commission-was  12,515,264. This sum was subsequently reduced by arrangement between the two parties to settle Appeals and Counter-Appeals on the question of Costs, etc., to  12,470,264.The award included sums for goodwill in respect of the Private Wire business and various overhead charges not usually charged to Capital Account in ordinary commercial practice, whilst depreciation was allowed for, to a large extent, on the basis of the physical life rather than the effective life of the plant.0.208 A 2 150,000 150,000 1,250,000 2,225,000 3,725,000 1,531,464 1,652,316

In 1913 the form of the Post Office telephone accounts was remodelled on the recommendations of a departmental committee in order to place the accounts on a commercial basis.  The system then adopted provides (a) that the telephone undertaking should be debited with the value ot services rendered to it by other Government departments, and should take credit for the value of telephone services rendered to other Government departments;(b) that plant and depreciation accounts should be set up, and that, instead of the actual expenditure on renewals of plant, an annual sum should be charged against revenue representing depreciation, calculated on the estimated effective life of the several classes of plant;(c) that, instead of the actual pensions paid during the year, revenue should be chargedannually in respect of pension liability with a sum equal to the contribution estimated to be required on a sinking fund basis to provide lor the eventual superannuation of the staff;(d) that interest should be charged against the undertaking on outstanding capital expenditure, and credit should be taken for interest on subscriptions paid in advance;(e) that the undertaking should be charged with an annual rental in respect of sites and buildingsbelonging to the Post Office used for telephone purposes.These accounts are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and are published annually as a Parliamentary paper.* Note.-The Post Office adopted in 1907 a provincial rate of  5, covering 500 calls, which is still in force in what are known as &quot; Tariff A &quot; areas, and The National Telephone Company fixed a rate of  6, also covering 500 calls, in the areas, now known as &quot; Tariff B&quot; areas, where the Company&apos;s service predominated.

It will be seen that prior to the war the telephone service, taken as a whole, showed a fair margin of profit; which the rates then existing would have been sufficient to maintain if conditions had remained unchanged and the system had developed on normal lines. But from 1914-15 onwards the effect of the war upon the finance of the service became more pronounced each year. By 1918-19 the war bonus granted to the staff had reached  1,200,000, and the charge for the civil pay of men released for military service had risen to  364,000. On the income side of the account, the revenue from the public, which should have shown a progressive expansion as the result of the large expenditure on development between 1913 and 1915, remained stationary, and would, in fact, have decreased if it had not been for the additional charges imposed in 19.15-16. On the other hand, the stagnation was masked by the credit&quot;- derived from the extensive use of the telephone system by Government departments during the war. These credits rose from  65,000 in 1913-14 to approximately  1,400,000 in 1918-19.8. It is clear that the results of the five years ending March, 1919, are of little or no value as a guide to the financial position of the telephone service in future. During a large part of the year 1919-20 the effect of the abnormal conditions was still felt. But 1920-21 will practically represent a normal year, and the estimated revenue and expenditure, compiled on a commercial basis and analysed under the principal headings, is shown in the following table. For purposes of comparison the corresponding figures for 1913-14, the last complete year before the war, have been added: Expenditure.			1 Revenue.			1913-14.	1920-21 (estimated).		1913-14.	1920-21 (estimated)Administrative and Operating Expenses  -Maintenance of System :-Salaries and Wages -Materials  -Wayleaves, Rates on Wires and other expenses Rent, Rates, Maintenance and Repair of Buildings  -Miscellaneous      -Interest .....

viREPORT FROM THE9. It will be seen that the most important increases fall under the heads of administrative and operating expenses, engineering salaries and Avages, depreciation and pension liability.Administrative and operating expenses have risen by about  3,200,000, and engineering salaries and wages by about  2,500,000. Of the total additional charge under these heads of  5,700,000,  4,210,000, or 74 per cent., is clue to the Avar bonus and tho remaining 26 per cent, is attributable partly to certain increases on the pre-war rates of wages and partly to normal development. The following table shows the gradual groAvth of Avages and Avar bonus from 1913-14 to the current year: Financial Year.	Salaries, &quot;Wages, &amp;c.	War Bonus.	Total.	 	 	 1913-14      -     -     -     -     -	2,472,091	 	2,472,0911914-15	2,736,689	- 	2,736,6891915-16      -     -     -	2,633,951	132,203	2,766,1541916-17      .....	2.576,678	234,049	2,810,7271917 18      .....	2,574,703	556,065	3,130,7681918-19      ---	2,572,175	1,198,118	3,770,2931919-20 (estimated)   -	3,410,000	2,610,000	6,020,0001920-21      ,,          ...	3,965,000	4,210,000	8,175,000In addition there are indirect charges for Avar bonus arising from Capital expenditure.10. Thus the pre-war surplus of between  200,000 and  300,000 will be converted into an estimated deficit of  3,980,000 in 1920/21, and the gradual introduction of an increasing proportion of plant purchased at present prices will tend to SAvell this deficit year by year, so long as costs remain at their existing level.It should be noted that a surplus or deficit upon the Telephone Service is not carried fonvard or capitalised, but is in effect an asset to, or a charge upon, the Exchequer for the year, as the case may be.11. The Post Office authorities contend that the economies in plant construction Avhich accompany development in any area are neutralised by the expenditure Avhich results from increased -complication of the plant and operating methods required to furnish inter-communication; and that, therefore, the advantage Avhich development will bring to an individual subscriber lies not in a reduction of his subscription, but in the increase in the number of persons Avith whom he can communicate. This argument is elaborated in the Departmental Committees Report, and Avas the subject of close examination by your Committee.12. There are three alternative methods of charging: 1. The flat rate, i.e., a fixed annual charge covering installation and an unlimited number of local calls.2. The measured service rate, i.e., a fixed annual charge for the installation and the sale of local calls in &quot; blocks,&quot; at a price decreasing as the number increases.3. The message rate, i.e., a fixed annual charge for the installation and a uniform charge for each effective local call.The principle of basing tariffs on the cost ot services rendered Avas advocated by the Post Office witnesses, Avho urged that the acceptance of that principle Avould involve the abolition of the flat rate and the measured service rate.Flat Bate.13. With regard to the flat rate, it Avas stated that, inasmuch as the number of operators depends not on the number of lines to be attended to, but on the number of calls to be handled, and the volume of traffic determines the extent of the junction line system and of a large portion of the exchange plant, increased traffic for a line means increased cost without corresponding additional revenue. Other objections Avere that the large users of the flat-rate system benefit at the expense of the small users, and that the tendency of flat-rate subscribers to overload their lines is a serious obstacle to efficiency. In this connection records show that a number of subscribers Avith only one line are making calls at the rate of over 10,000 a year, whereas the maximum capacity of a line, if its efficiency is to be unimpaired, is not more than 5,000 outAvard calls and an equal number of inAvard calls a year.Measured Service Rate.14. The Post Office consider that this rate, by differentiating in favour of the larger users, is open.to the same objections, though in a modified form.Message Rate.15. This rate, in the opinion of the Department, represents the only strictly equitable basis of charges for telephone service. No preferential treatment is given, and large and small users are placed on the same footing. The principle adopted is that the annual rental should cover the cost of the subscribers equipment, and the message fee should pay the operating expenses. In the case of the Trunk Line system the Avholc cost must be recouped by the message charges

In framing the suggested tariffs the Department have assumed that prices will remain substantially at the present level, i.e., May, 1920.The suggested tariffs are: (a) for an exclusive exchange line: ----	London.

At present a special charge of Is. Qd. is made.For a similar reason they propose that the minimum charge for a call to or from the Isle of Wight shall be 6d.ft is estimated that if these tariffs are sanctioned and are in full operation by April 1st, 1921, the financial effect will be as follows: Financial Year.

Surplus (4-) or Deficit (-).1921-22 -                              ... 1922-23 .....-1923-24 -            - .&apos; -1924-25 ------	  15,200,000 16,7C0,000 18,400,000 20,200,000	  16,000,000 17,300,000 18,600,000 19,700,000	  4- 800,000 -t 600,000 * 200,000 - 500,00019. It is further suggested that the existing distinction between Trunk and Junction calls should be abolished and that all charges for calls should be based on distance. The local fee should cover communication with any exchange within a radius of five miles from the originating exchange, and the Trunk and Junction charges should be merged in a uniform mileage scale, and so graduated that the charge for any distance is a multiple of the local fee.London Area.20. The recommendation in the Departmental Committee&apos;s Keport regarding the London area is that the London telephone area should comprise exchanges within a circle of 10 miles radius, having Oxford Circus for its centre. In view of the strong objections taken to this proposal, both by witnesses from portions of the area proposed to be excluded and by the London Chamber of Commerce, your Committee wish to draw attention to the following passages in the Depart-mental Report.: &quot; Inclusion or exclusion from the new London area will not affect the service given to &quot; individual subscribers in the outlying portions of the present area. They will still be able &quot; to obtain communication with inner London without the intervention of the Trunk &quot; Exchange, and the service will be operated in the same manner as at present.&quot; We propose that, for the purpose of calculating the fees for calls (a) between any two &quot;London exchanges and (b) between London exchanges and exchanges not more than 30 &quot; miles from the centre of London, the area enclosed in a circle of 5 miles radius from Oxford
SELECT COMMITTEE OX TELEPHONE CHARGES,ix&quot; Circus should bo treated as a single point, Tho effect of this proposal, coupled with the &quot; provision that all exchanges will havo a local fee radius of 5 miles, will be that &quot; (a) all exchanges within 5 miles of the centre will havo intercommunication at the local&quot; fee with all exchanges within 10 miles of the centre; &quot; (b) all exchanges more than 5 miles and not more than 10 miles from the centre will &quot; have intercommunication at the local fee with all exchanges within a 5-mile &quot; radius and with all exchanges within 5 miles of the centre; &apos;: (c) calls between exchanges both of which are more than 5 miles but not more than 10 &quot; miles from the centre, will be charged either on the direct distance between the &quot; exchanges, or on the sum of the distances to the nearest points on the 5-miles &quot; circle, whichever is the less.   (In many cases the local fee will cover these calls) &quot; (d) calls in both directions between London exchanges (i.e., exchanges within tho &quot; 10-mile circle) and exchanges not more than 30 miles from the centre will bo &quot; charged either on the direct distance between the exchanges, or on tho sum of &quot; the distances to the nearest points on the 5-mile circle, Avhichever is the less.&quot; In order to obviate differences of charge for long distance calls to or from exchanges within 5 miles of the centre in London, the Post Office recommend that, for the purpose of fixing the trunk-fee, the distance be measured from the central point (Oxford Circus) in all cases where it exceeds 30 miles.CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.21. Although the question of efficiency is not strictly relevant to tho Terms of Reference, which only authorised inquiiy into charges, your Committee consider themselves entitled to comment on the criticisms levelled at the administration of the telephone service, which was more than once referred to as being inefficient and unbusinesslike. Your Committee consider, from the evidence which came before them, that in many instances there is undoubted ground for complaint. Considerable sections of the public are convinced that Government ownership of itself produces a sort of inertia fatal to any service which is dependent for its success on initiative and enterprise, but in the case of the Telephone service it should be remembered that the Department has scarcely had a fair chance, seeing that war broke out two and a half years after the transfer, and that since 1914 circumstances have, to say the least of it, been unfavourable to development. The telephone systems in America are often quoted to the disparagement of the service in this country, but it must be remembered that Avar conditions affected America for a much shorter period of time and with far less intensity than this country.22. Your Committee note with satisfaction that so long ago as 1913 the telephone accounts were placed on a commercial basis (Par. 5). They are of opinion that additional revenue should be looked for from judicious development rather than from such heavy increase in charges as may tend to hinder that development. Development admittedly depends to a large extent on small users, among whom the service might, by canvassing and advertisement, be made more popular than it is at present. In this connection the existence of honorary Telephone Advisory Committees set up by the Post Office in 1913 is too little known to the public. There are fifty-one such Committees in the larger towns, and their functions are to assist the administration of the local service by discussion with local telephone officers, by representing the views of subscribers and the public, and by submitting suggestions and criticisms to the Department. Your Committee recommend that similar Advisory Committees should be set up in all suitable areas in the country, and that subscribers should be invited to make complaints to them instead of direct to the Post Office. They would thus, by an extension of their activities, form a real link between the subscriber and the Department.Research.23. Your Committee regard research as essential to a service involving so much technical work, and recommend a considerable extension of the Research Department, the expenditure on which is at present comparatively small. Inventive genius should be more liberally encouraged, both inside and outside the staff.RATES. Flat Rate.24. On the question of the flat rate, the views of the Post Office have been summarised in Paragraph 13. The evidence of users showed some diversity of opinion, and among the sugges-tions were: (1) Retention of the unlimited flat rate.(2) A limited flat rate.(3) Flat rate for small users and small places and for resident subscribers in all but thelargest cities, and its abolition for large users. (4) Total abolition.In the opinion of your Committee one of the most difficult problems which had to be considered was the practicability of adhering to the flat or unlimited service rate, With regard to this rate your Committee, while they are quite aware that large subscribers must receive full consideration, are of opinion that there can be no reason why the State should supply them Avith services considerably under cost price. After careful consideration of the very full evidence given on this matter, your Committee have come to the conclusion that no adjustment of the flat rate would meet the case, and they recommend its discontinuance.Measured Service Rate. Your Committee recommend the discontinuance of the measured service rate. 0.208.
xREPORT FROM Til EMessage Rate.Your Committee find themselves in agreement with the Post Office in recommending the message rate as the only equitable system of payment for service rendered, and they are mainly influenced by the following considerations: (1) The fact that as regards business houses the telephone is essential to the conduct of their business should not bo regarded as a reason for allowing them to continue on the flat rate system.(2) Under the message rate system there will be an inducement to check unnecessary use of the telephone.(3) The present temptation to overload a line would be less obvious.The additional annual cost of accounting, operating, etc., involved by tho change from flat rate to message rate is estimated by the Department to be  34,000, but on the other hand, an additional revenue of approximately  1,200,000 is anticipated.Public, Call Offices.25. The message fee Avas raised in 1915 from 2d. in London to 3d., and from Id. in the provinces to 2d., and this increase Avas followed by ah immediate drop in the number of calls of 30 per cent, in London and 50 per cent, in the provinces. It is the vieAV of the Post Office that though tho present charges are unremunerative, any addition to the number of pennies over three Avould fail to yield additional revenue, besides causing inconvenience to the public, and greater difficulties of operation; and your Committee assent to this vieAv. They approve, hoAvcver, of the proposal made by the Post Office, that a uniform charge of 3d. for a local call bo made both in London and the Provinces.Chech on Calls.26. Some of the evidence showed that the absence of an automatic check on the registration of calls creates a suspicion in the minds of many message-rate subscribers that they are over-charged. It is perhaps natural, though scarcely logical, that allegations of mathematical inaccuracy on the part of operators do not extend to undercharging. Some of the witnesses urged that it ought to be possible to devise some form of meter or instrument Avhich Avould check calls at the subscriber^ end, and your Committee are glad to learn from the Secretary to the Post Office that experiments are being conducted avith that object in vieAv. There are obviously many obstacles to be overcome, such as the necessity for distinguishing between effective and ineffective calls, but it is most desirable that with a universal message rate subscribers should have some protection. The abolition of the flat rate will probably lead to an increase of disputes as to the number of calls charged to the subscriber. It is therefore of additional importance that a subscribers check shoidd be introduced at the earliest possible date.Your Committee understand that the Post Office propose adopting, when practicable, automatic exchanges; Avhen this is carried out there should be feAver complaints in reference to charges for calls not used.The automatic system is already in operation in the folloAving towns: Accrington, Blackburn ChepstOAv, Darlington, Dudley, Epsom, Grimsby, Hereford, Leeds, NeAvport (Mon.), Paisley, Portsmouth and Stockport.Subscribers Accounts.27. The Department recommend, and your Committee approve, that, in lieu of the present annual payment, a quarterly system of accounts be adopted for rentals and calls, and that the present system of monthly accounts for trunk calls and telegrams should be continued at the option of subscribers, on payment of a fee of 4s. per annum. In vieAv of the abolition of the unlimited sendee rate, your Committee consider that an opportunity should be given to subscribers to check their accounts at more frequent intervals than three months, and that, on payment of a fee of ten shillings per annum, a monthly report of calls (excluding trunk calls and telegrams) should be furnished. The present minimum charge for 360 calls in London and 500 in the Provinces, Avhether used or not, should be abolished and payment only made for calls used.London Area.28. Your Committee regard the Departments proposal, set out in Paragraph 20 of this Report, as a reasonable solution of a difficult problem. The evidence on this question shoAved that there is some misapprehension as to the effects of the proposal, and reference to the passages quoted in the same paragraph should remove some, at any rate, of the objections advanced. One of the points raised Avas the desirability of including the Port of London in the London Telephone Area, but your Committee, Avhile recognising its importance, have come to the conclusion that no exception can be made Avithout injustice to other portions of the area proposed to be excluded.They recommend that the London Telephone Directory should be available to all subscribers outside the iicav London area, but Avithin 15 miles of Oxford Circus, at net cost price (giving credit for advertisements); and that subscribers in the London Telephone Area (Avho will continue to receive that Directory gratis) should be permitted to purchase any of the Directories supplied subscribers outside that area, but Avithin 15 miles of Oxford Circus, at net cost price.Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester.29. Your Committee recommend the adoption of the same principle as that proposed in regard to London, with the folloAving modification: In these cities the area Avithin a circle of two miles radius from the centre should be treated as a point for calculating the fees on local calls, and
SELECT COMMITTEE ON TELEPHONE CHARGES.xitrunk calls between exchanges in tho central area and exchanges not more than 30 miles from the centre of that area. The local fee will, therefore, cover calls between any exchange in the central area and any exchange within seven miles of tho centre.For the purpose of fixing the trunk fee on calls over 30 miles from the contre, the distance should be measured from that point (as in the case of London from Oxford Circus).Minor Recommcndqt ions.30. Your Committee recommend the continuance of the rural party (Farmer) lines referred to in Paragraph 69 of the Departmental Committees Report, although this advantage does not seem to be properly appreciated by those in whose special interest it was introduced. This concession should be more widely brought to the notice of those in agricultural communities on account of its manifest importance to tho national interests.The proposed new tariff for private telephone wires (Paragraph 74) appears to your Committee unnecessarily high, and your Committee would suggest some modification in this respect wherever possible without undue interference with (ho necessity for uniformity in the scale of charges.Your Committee are of the opinion that the charges suggested in Paragraphs 80 to 83 of the Departmental Committee&apos;s Report are reasonable in the circumstances, but would recommend that in the case of imposing a special charge for continuous service, or of even abolishing it in some districts, special consideration should be shown lor such exceptional cases as doctors, chemists, fire brigade service, police, &amp;c. and any other national service.Your Committee recommend that the present charges for removals, which are 80 per cent, higher than before the war, should not bo increased.Among other suggestions of the Post Office with which your Committee concur are the following: (a) The Postmaster-General should take power to refuse service to any subscriber on whose line the number of&quot; engaged &quot; calls exceeds 25 per cent, of the number of effective incoming calls, if he refuses to rent an additional circuit, and in order to encourage the renting of additional circuits the charge for these should be  1 less than the charge for the original circuit. Great waste of time and money is caused by &quot; engaged&quot; calls, and the annual cost ot handling such calls is stated to be  1,000,000. Your Committee - would emphasise the necessity for very careful records being made in such cases.(b) The surcharge of  4 on new installations should be abolished.Tariffs.31. In Paragraph 18 of this Report the tariffs proposed by the Post Office are set out, together with the estimated financial effect of those tariffs. The estimates on which the Departmental Committee based their Report were framed in May, 1920, since which the war bonus has risen by about 20 per cent. Jt is stated by the Department that the recent fall in the price of certain materials will only represent a very small set-off to the increase in wages, and that the estimated balance of  800,000 for the first year (Paragraph 18) has been absorbed. In face of the facts and figures put before your Committee by the Post Office, they consider the proposed tariffs justifiable and recommend their adoption. But they further recommend that, following the usual commercial custom, a rebate should be allowed to subscribers using 2,000 or more calls a year.32. It is the view of your Committee that development on commercial lines, combined with economy and increased efficiency, may produce more favourable financial results than those fore-shadowed by the Department, quite apart from a fall in prices. Should this anticipation be realised and the accounts in any year show a substantial surplus, your Committee recommend that a proportion of such surplus be returned to subscribers by way of a reduction in installation rentals.33. It should be understood that your Committee&apos;s recommendations are based on the existing financial situation of the Telephone Service, which is still governed by abnormal conditions arising out of the War.They consider it desirable that the question of charges should be reconsidered within the next five years by a Parliamentary Committee.34. In the course of their inquiry your Committee had occasion to ask the officials of the Post Office for much detailed information other than that which appears in the Departmental Committee&apos;s Report and in the evidence.They desire to express their appreciation of the assistance they have received, in this and other respects, from Sir Evelyn Murray, k.ob., and his staff.Printed under the authority of HIS MAJESTVS STATIONERY OFFICE By Wyman &amp; Sons, Limited, Fetter Lane, London, E.O. 4.
