f* DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNTC MAJESTY*S OOVERNMENT)&apos;.IjlFIDSNTIAL.p. 2483.C A B I N E T.injEMPLOYJTOT GRAjjTS COhbilTTKr;.REVISION OF CONDITIONS OF GRANTS TO LOCALAUTHORITIES.COPY OF LETTER FROM THE CHAIR iAII OF THE(Reference Conference of Ministers, January 24th 1921,Conclusion l,   )*20, Carlton House Terrace, London, S.T7.1.20th January, 1921*Dear Prime Minister,Wo have now heard that the Government have given us power to deal with roads which are not within the Ministry of Transportfs scheme for construction or maintenance grantst     The concession is, however, limited by an indication from the Treasury that as a general rule we should only make grants in cases where the expenditure on labour will not be less than 50 per cent of the total expenditure *The Ministry of Transport tell us that e xcept in cases of new roads or of road work in which there is a great deal of excavation to be done, the labour cost will very seldom approximate to 50 per cent of the work.     The ordinary road work to be done now in towns and industrial areas is the replacing of wood blocks;   in such cases the normal cost of labour would be between 20 and 30 per cent of the total cost.     It is obvious, therefore, that the powers now granted to us will only Increase to a very limited extent our capacity for promoting employment.We have possibly delayed too long in asking for further powers, but thought it right to do our very best with the powers given us before coming to the Cabinet again. We were appointed on the 20th December.     The position now is that the total grants we have promised to cover work up to the 30th April, 1921, only amount to  72,760;    the number of men for whom our schemes are estimated to provide work amount to 4350 (approximately) including 740 on part t ime *It appears clear that so far as the Cabinet may be relying upon us to get our three millions ( 3.000,000) out quickly for the relief of unemployment, we have not been a success..     My Committee think therefore that the time has come when w e should again submit the position to the Government.     The Government will no doubt remember that the 30 per cent we are empowered &quot;to give is in most cases far from being 30 per cent of the cost of the whole workc I Taking as a whole the schemes which we assist, we are prob-ably granting frnly something like 15 per cent of the cost up to the 30th April, or even less.     It follows that before our three millions can be expended Local Authorities would have to get together something approximating to eighteen or twenty millions from other sources to meet our grants *
The recommendation we would make to the Cabinet is that our advances, to vmxls the cost of Labour should no longer be limited to JO &quot;per Cwnt, but should be extended to at least 60 oer cent at once,Yours sincerely, (Si-ned)   ST. DAVIDS.Ht. Hon. D, Lloyd George, M.P.
