Serial No.172MINISTRY OP FOOD.DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON WHOLESALE FOOD MARKETS,3rd   Report s Supplementary    Note,In view of the delay that has occurred In the publication, of the above report, we find It necessary to record certain changes which have since taken place In the situationsOur fintungs on this subject were based on evidence taken intjie latter part of 1919 and the eovjjear months of 1920, and ire B3&amp;rnow able to record the fact that such deivinij*rjcies as then-existed have since, to a large extent, been  rumo/iie^ Preeh evidence taken by us In February, 1921, when tqiwo^ + h-Ives of the London Pish Trades Association, on behalf of the London wholesale merchants, and of the National Pish Trades Association^pn behalf of the retailers, shows that great Improvement has taken place in the train services; and that there is now very little gr^ind for complaint either as regards the adequacy of J^he services or the punctual running and arrival in London of the trains from the various ports. * Both witnesses pointed out that difficulties which still remain are due to abnormal seasonal catches, but they agreed that the railway companies are providing all reasonable facilities within their powers to meet such exceptional traffic.   It is important to note in this connection that the railway companies are now being called upon to deal with quantities of fish considerably in excess of those normally handled *by them in the period preceding August, 1914.T?e are glad also to report a substantial diminution in the quantity of fish condemned.   Fish is now being received in the market in much better condition than was the&apos; case 12 months ago, despite the large increase In the volume of traffic.  Witnesses agree that rail-borne fisk is being delivered to the market in sufficient time fcr its normal requirements.The new mezzanine floor referred to In Paragraph 26 of our report has now been completed with the exception of a few fittings, the construction of which is well advanced. This floor provides 68 additional stands, all of which are larger than those on the ground floor of the market.  These stands are all let and will be used either -for over flow business or for public sale.   They have provided opportunities for the admission to the market of several new stand holders.A new electric/Is being substituted for the old one and an equipment of suitable trucks has been provided for transport ing fish in bulk to and frort the floor J   It is anticipated that this will greatly facilitate the prompt unloading of vans. Mechanical ventilation of the new florr has also been provided, and arrangements have been made to restrict to tenants of stands and shops to the exact limits of the areas allowed to them in order that the various avenues of the market    shall, be maintained at their full widtlu(i)   Railway Transport.(2) Alterations at Billingsgateift
