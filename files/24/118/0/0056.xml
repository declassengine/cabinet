W.The War Office,l&amp;th January, 1921.MEMORANDUM.I. Remarks on the Colonial Office &quot; Summary of the Present Position.&quot;The &quot;Summary of the Present Position&quot; in Section II. of the Colonial Office Memorandum is generally concurred in, subject to the following remarks on (c) and (d): (c.) P*ay and allowances of the Kings African Rifles.The memorandum correctly states that proposals for deciding the ultimate incidence of this pay, &amp;c, as from 1st June, 1916, were formulated, but it omits to state that they were actually agreed to between the Colonial Office and the War Office, at a time when the i\mg&apos;s African Rifles had reached practically their maximum strength of 22 battalions, as against a peace-time strength of three battalions. Only some few points of detail remained to be settled with the Governor of the East African Protectorate to render the agreement operative ; and the statement that &quot; the proposals were not accepted by the Protectorate Governments and the question is now one for settlement,&quot; thus hardly conveys the position.It should also be mentioned that these charges include the pay of a considerable number of Imperial personnel specially retained in the country after 1st April, 1919, at &apos; the request of the Governor of the East African Protectorate.(d.) Pay, Sc., of the so-called &quot; Common Organizations.&quot;In the later stages of the war the pay and allowances of even units of a purely Protectorate character, employed for Protectorate purposes, came to be borne by the Common Charges Accounts. Not only did the Treasury and War Office (as stated in the Colonial Office Memorandum) lay down that the Uganda and East Africa Protectorates should eventually be called upon to bear a larger proportion of the expenditure upon these &quot; Common Organizations&quot; than of the &quot;Common Charges&quot; generally, but the Colonial Office itself accepted this principle.Some remarks upon the use for civil purposes of roads and railways of which the maintenance and operation are charged in these Common Charges Accounts are made below.(B21/E8)   1U0  1/21  HAS, Ltd.   887lwo
II. Amounts for Adjudication. (a.) East African Common Charges Account   ...   27,500,000/. (approximately). (b.) Nyasaland Common Charges Account      ...    5,250,000/. ( ).Total Common Charges   ...   32,750,000/.The War Office had intended to propose, as a basis of settlement, the principle of division roughly in proportion to the strengths of Imperial and local forces engaged (as suggested in the last paragraph of the Chancellor of the Exchequers Memorandum) subject to special adjustments&apos; in respect of the items referred to under (d) above. Complete figures for strengths are not available, but their proportions would be roughly per cent.Imperial Government..       ...      ...      ...      ...      90East Africa Protectorate and Uganda       ...      ...        7&quot;5Nyasaland     ......      .........      ...       2&apos;5On this basis, which probably gives the Protectorates the advantage of the doubt, their share would be -fo of 32,750,000/. ^ 3,275,000/.viz., 800,000/. chargeable to Nyasaland and 2,475,000/. to be divided between East Africa (Kenya Colony) and Uganda.The special claim in respect of&quot; Common Organizations,&quot; referred to above, would be additional to these amounts.(c.) King&apos;s African Eijies Joint Account, 3,000,000/. (approximately).From June, 1916, onwards, all expenditure on pay and allowances of the King&apos;s African &apos;Rifles battalions was charged to a joint account which existed between the War Office and the Protectorates concerned (East Africa, Uganda and Nyasaland). The principle of settlement alluded to at Section I. (c) above, which the Colonial Office accepted, was that the Protectorates should bear the cost of the ordinary establishment of the King&apos;s African Rifles, with reserves and recruits to replace wastage on that establishment, while the East African Protectorate should also bear the cost of the 5th Piegiment, King&apos;s African Rifles, which was required solely for Protectorate purposes.   This gives the following apportionments, on the best figures available :  War Office....................   2,490,000East Africa and Uganda..............      390,000Nyasaland............      .........     120,000III. Information Bearing on the Capacity of the Protectorates toContribute.Major-General Koe, the Salvage Commissioner sent to East Africa in 1918, lays stress in his reports on certain effects of the war in a manner calculated to qualify (so far as British East Africa is concerned) the statement in the Colonial Office memorandum that &quot; the trade of the Protectorates has been paralyzed and their powers of production and development have been gravely interfered with.&quot; Of British East Africa he says : &quot; The future policy of the country was not in jeopardy, and during the-war it had prospered exceedingly by its production of such articles as sisal and flax, which were urgently required at home in connection with the manufacture of war material.&quot; An extensive area was devoted to the production of these commodities even during the war, as the war operations took place almost entirely in German East Africa, and very considerable development ensued on the termination of hostilities. In his report General Koe states that &quot; the value of the country from an economic point of view became recognized by the Home Government (so soon as the danger from enemy attack had subsided), and steps were taken to withdraw settlers from the forces and to urge the importance of the cultivation of their estates with a view to the obtaining of the maximum possible output of those commodities which were essential for the production of war material at home.&quot;It appears that new roads were made, existing ones were repaired, and large tracts of country were opened up by the construction of new railway lines, originally for purely military purposes, such as the Voi, Usambara and Central Railways, but maintained for as long as two years after they had ceased to be of any military value, solely in civil interests, without any contribution by the Civil Government towards the cost of working.
9 aV. Summary.On the above basis the amounts now due from the several local Governments would be as follows : Description.	East Africa (Kenya) and Uganda.	Nyasaland.1 Common Charges generally .. King&apos;s African Rifles Railway charges	f 2,475,000 390,000 200,000	  800,000 120,000Total...	8,0(?5,000	920,000besides the extra claim in respect of &quot; Common Organizations &quot; referred to at Sections I (d) and II (a) above, and the fair value of any railway taken over.In addition, the Protectorates should hear their due share of the pension charges arising out of the campaign year by year as they accrue, in accordance with the original intention. The simplicity of the arrangement suggested in the Colonial Office Memorandum is one-sided.A further impetus to local prosperity was brought about by the large sales of surplus stores which took place on the conclusion of hostilities.A special reduction of 10 per cent, on the agreed price of all articles purchased from the Salvage Commission was approved by the Treasury (at the instance of the Colonial Office) in the case of East Africa and Uganda, of course at the expense of the Imperial Exchequer.The principle of Zanzibar&apos;s contribution to the cost of the local campaign suggested by the Colonial Office would involve a very considerable refund from Imperial funds, as the pre-war military budget of the Protectorate only provided for about one half-company of the King&apos;s African Rifles. There is nothing to justify this in the financial position of the Protectorate.As regards Nyasaland, General Koe remarks that &quot; several new roads had been constructed, and others, though belonging to the Civil Government, had been kept in repair by the Military Authorities.&quot; As the country relies entirely upon roads as a means of communication, the value of this boon is obvious, but no charge has so far been made against the Civil Government. Nyasaland also profited from important purchases of local produce for war purposes and from sales of surplus stores on a large scale.IV. Railways.In addition to the benefits above referred to, accruing to the Protectorates in consequence of railways being operated at the expense of &quot;Common Charges&quot; solely in the interests of the Civil Government, large revenue was secured from war traffic, by railways normally operated on civil funds, especially the Uganda Railway. This is a State railway belonging to the East Africa Protectorate (Kenya Colony), and its charges for transport within East Africa and the capital expenditure on rolling stock and other railway material procured on the order of the General Officer Commanding must make up a very formidable item in the Common Charges Account. In a detailed report on war-time railway charges in East Africa, Captain Tew, a railway expert sent out towards the end of 1918 by the War Office, states that &quot;the Uganda Railway were allowed to charge as they pleased (during the war), and they have not considered any charge, however remotely connected with the war, too small to recover, as it was understood a reckoning would be made on the excess profits earned.&quot;A review of the accounts of the railway during the war shows, as compared with the 1913-14 accounts, a net increased receipt per year of 44,000?., and, taking into consideration the fact that &quot; working expenses have not increased in the same ratio as gross earnings,&quot; and that &quot;the relief to these working expenses as obtained through charging &apos; Common Charges&apos; with every possible description of charge,&quot; Captain Tew arrives at a figure of some 45,00()Z. which, he considers, should be refunded to &quot; Common Charges &quot; by the Uganda Railway for each year of war; say, 200,000?., in all. Further, if any lines built from military funds during the war are retained as working lines by the Civil Governments, credit should be given for lines and equipment at their fair commercial value.
