The S.S. &quot;Dnieper&quot; (Vfrangel1 s forces) recently arrived at Rotterdam from the Black Sea.   The Italian &quot;Banco di Roma&quot; has put in a claim for the value of the cargo and the Soviet Government is claiming the ship, on the basis that all Wrangel&apos;s former ships are now the property of the Soviet Government.The following instructions for entry into the Port of Novorossisk have been circulated by the Soviet Government:-1*    The port of Novorossisk is tho second port in the Bladi: Sea open to foreign vossSls.2.

But with the cost price to-day ranging from 4 to 5 ,,000 marks, the indemnity to be paid to shipping companies would fall short by about 30$.NETHERLANDS.Commander S. L. \7harton has been accredited as Naval Attache at The Hague and. at Warsaw.

PART II.    GENERAL INTEILIGENOE.AFGHANISTAN.The Amir is reported, to &quot;be finding&quot; Jemal Pasha1 s activities embarrassing&apos; now that the British Mission has arrived.     He has consistently refused to adopt Jemal&apos;s help and offer of financial assistance :to assist the frontier tribes and Indian Seditionists against the British,    The Amir has given orders that all Anti-British agitation is to cease and/has taken steps to prevent the Kabul populace from having any intercourse witb Indian   and other seditionists. On the other hand the Bolshevik and Turkish parties in Kabul are said to be increasing their influences.PERSIA.The present situation in Persia is extremely unsettled.    After the Shah&apos;s efforts to leave the country, as mentioned in previous reports., he was approached by representatives of all parties on the subject, and, finding that their devotion to the throne was still pronounced, he abandoned the   idea of flight and resolved to remain and do what he could for his country.    He is now endeavouring to raise a strong Cabinet with Nationalist representatives.RUSSIA.Georgia.    The Georgians have received a note from the looal Soviet Representative containing several demands, Of which chief are1.   Release of Bolshevik agitators arrested in Georgia. 2.   Release of Bolshevik goods reoently seized byGeorgian Govt. 3.   Dismissal of Georgian Commissioner at Batoum forordering the lowering of Bolshevik flags hoisted on ships and on shore.The Georgian Govt. have decided to refuse all demands, which may lead to rupture of diplomatic relations.    The Govt. has further decided to mobilise its forces as, although they do not anticipate that the refusal of the Soviet demands will lead to an immediate attack by the   Bolsheviks, they are convinced that at some later and more-opportune moment the Bolsheviks will attack Georgia.AUSTRIA.The strike of postal and telegraph employees is over, but the general state of unrest continues.ITALY.The Governments of Great Britain, Franco, America and Japan have made urgent representations to the Italian Govern-merit regarding Italian transactions in arms with the Anfu Party in China, and have invited the Italian Government to adhere to&apos; the existing embargo upon such transactions.
HQARABIA.It is report eel tb^t considerable fighting has taken place recently between the Idrissi^s foroes and those of the Iniarric    The Qubra tribe and the Idrissi have expelled the Imamio troops from territory previously  occupied by them.It appears evident that the Izzet Mission is being held prisoner at Angora.GREECE.Tbe Greek Army appears to have recovered from the political crisis occasioned by the fall of Venizelos. It may now be taken as approximately of the same strength and fighting value as before the crisis, but a loss of efficiency in the high command may be expected.The operations in the Brusa area having; been, according to the Greek General Staff, completely successful, the Greek troops have now been withdrawn to their original line.    Esk.1shehr, which was announced to be the original objective, was never occupied, and consequently the Turkish Nationalist press is Jubilant at what it construes to be a Nationalist victory.Greek Headquarters estimate that the total strength of the Turkish We stern tony, including irregulars, is under 15,000.The Greek Government estimate that the campaign in Asia ?-*inor is costing about  3,000,000 per month.    They oan carry on for another three or four months without assistance.FRANCE,M. Briand, the New French Prime Minister, in his speech announcing the new Cabinet!s policy, said that the essentials were the disarmament of Germany and the execution of the Treaty of Versailles;   payment to $ranee by Germany of her Just dues;   no relations with the Government of Soviet Russia, but no more anti-Bolshevist adventures so long as Lenin1a Government keeps within its own boundaries; and that the closest alliance between France and Great  Britain 13 the very basis of their foreign policy.AIBANTA.Vrlords, President of Albania, is reported to have sent a representative to   Athens to arrange directly with Greece the question of the boundaries of N.&quot; Epirus-and Goritaa, at the suggestion, it is said, of Italy.
SPAIN,In consequence of a Royal decree authorising the creation of 100 new officials ranking as Heads of Departments of Ministry of Finance, all officials of that department have gone on strike *    The Minister of finance has tendered his resignation in consequence.SYRIA,Trouble has undoubtedly brov en out again in cilicia and the unsatisfactory state of affairs, combined with the great expense of maintaining troops there, may possibly lead to an early withdrawal by the French.
