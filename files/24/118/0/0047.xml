CABINS T.SUUVEY 0? 2KB STATS OS1 IR3LOD FOR $SEJE 2BDED JANUAKY 10th, 1921,(Circulated to the Cabinet by tho Chief Secretary for&quot; Ireland).I submit for the information of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 10th instant.GENERAL vTATS OF THE COUNTRY,Statistics of Outrages.The Peace discussions of the past week which have occurred so largo a share of public attention have had no perceptible effect in staying the course of political crime in Ireland, &quot;She forces of the Crown are now almost invariably successful, and tho attacks by Sinn Seiners aro rarely pushed home.     89 Outrages-of various kinds were reported, a slight increase cm tl^r^TtnX&apos; of the previous week.     A new feature of tjiese jkawxeuu activities ha- been the number of raids upon tho offices&quot; of rate collectors. Twenty-two such raids were reported during the week, and sums of money amounting to a total of  85962.6c5. wore seized.12 Attacks upon parties or individual members of the Crown Forces were re orted and resulted in a total of 22 casualties (2.Police killed and 19 Police and 1 soldier wounded).One of the two fatal Police casualties was that of a District Inapoctor who was shot dead on the 7th Instant&apos; at Ballinaleo, Granard District., while on patrol.      The other case was that of a Constable who died from wounds received in an ambush &quot;at Parnoll Bridge, Cork, on the 4th instant.        Six other policomon of a total party of eight were also wounded, on this occasion by a bomb thrown by the attackers.
An encounter on a considerable scale with revel forces took place the 4th instant near the village of Meelin, Newmarket District, Co. Cork, where a party of military and police in two motor lorries were ambushed by a boy of about 200 volunteers armed with rifles, revolvers and two machine guns. The soliders and police took cover and returned the fire. A brisk engagement followed, but a short time after a number of soldiers succeeded in breaking through in one of the lorries and reached Newmarket without accident.

Reinforcements were quickly on the scene and the anbushers dispersed. No police or military casualties were sustained in these engagements, but a number of the raiders are believed to have been wounded. Four houses in Meelin from which the attackers were seen to fire were destroyed by order of the Military Governor.

Two attacks on occupied barracks were made during the week (Tramers. Co. Waterford and Kilbrittan, Bancon District. Co. Cork). The attack on Tramere Barrack, on the 7th instant lasted an hour and a half, but was beaten off after the arrival of police and military reinforcements from Waterford. The relief party was ambushed on its way to Tramore, but succeeded in driving off its assailants, three of whom were killed. One soldier belonging to the relief party was seriously wounded, and one constable of the defending garrison was wounded but not dangerously. No casualties were sustained in the defence of Kilbrittan Barracks. The attack in this case was repelled without difficulty.

Raids upon mails fell from 43 to 29 and raids for arms from 15 to 3.

In view of the repeated interferences with the transport of mails it has now been decided to make drastic curtailments of the mail services which had been the object of most  
frequent attack, ? in accordance with this decision, the earning of which was given to tho public by an official announcement issued a few weeks ago, the following five mail ? services have been suspended as from the 10th insta?t.

Sligo - Ballyshannon

Ballymote - Aclare

Fintown - Dungloe

Thurlee - Nenagh

Thurlee - Kilcommon.

In order to minimiso the incovenience unavoidably caused to innocent persons arrangements will be made for the occasional conveyance of correspondence in bulk to the districts affected.

Arrests for outrages and political offences numbered 76 for the week.

Trials of Civilians by Court Martial.

Twenty-six trials of civilians by Court Martial took place during the week, and resulted in twenty-two convictions and four acquittal?. Sentences of ?nal sorvitude were inflicted in two cases, for periods of three years and five years respectively. In the former case in which the lighter sentence was imposed a number of flat-nosed cartridges were discovered in a Search of the prisoner&apos;s residence. The latter case was that of a man who was arrested in the public streets with a revolver in his possession loaded in six chambers. Imprisonment with hard labour for periods ranging from one month to two years was imposed in fourteen cases, the option of a fine of £5. being allowed in one case in place of a month&apos;s imprisonment. A fine of £5. or in default imprisonment without hard labour for fourteen days was imposed in another case. In three of the reamining four cases the sentence was remitted by the Confirming Officer, and in the fourth the accused was bound over in his own recognizances of £50. to be of good 
behaviour for a years Internment Orders,107 Orders let internment were made during the wee/ .     The total number of inwrmdnt orders to date is 1298.
