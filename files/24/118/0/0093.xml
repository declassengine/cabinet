CABINET.MM pw mm.     m ** ** * *Committee .. ?; lome AffairsMKRCHAI:DISE jjARXS BILL,andum by the President of the Bortrd of Trade.I submit herewith for the consideration of my colleagues a draft of a Bill to give effect to the unanimous recommendations of a Committee appointed by.my predecessor in October 1919, to consider Inter alia whether any extension or amendment of the Merchandise harks Act is required in respect of the provisions relating to indications of origin,Many of the proposals contained In this foeasure are of a samewhat technical character into which it is not necessary for me to go in detail, but I would direct special attention to the following proposals which are embodied therein:..1. Compulsory Indications of Origin.   The existing Merchandise Marks Act, although it provides in a certain limited class of cases that goods on importation into tho United Kingdom shall bear an indi-cation&quot;&apos;of origin, does not enforce this requirement generally.   The Committee on whose recommendations this Bill has been drafted did not advise the ^enforcement of any such general requirement, but they pro-posed that the- Board of Trade should have power, after enquiry, to make an Order requiring such an indication where they were satisfied that it was in the public interests   Tho first Section of the present Bill has been drafted to give effect to this recommendation.   Tne Committee in particular draw attention to two classes of cases in which such an indication might be desirable, -(a) oases in which foreign goods without bearing marks which are false within tho meaning of the Merchandise Harks Act, deliberately imitate British goods in their form or get up,(b) cases in which foreign goods are manufactured, produced or sold in circumstances constituting unfair competition.I am satisfied that there are trades in the United Kingdom
469which will he in a position to demonstrate, that i$ is in the public interest to require indications of origin on these or other grounds.2.     Tho Bill, in pursuance of the CommitteeTs recommendations, authorises the making of Orders prohibiting the use of par-tioular British emblems or devices (for example the Union Jack, the Shamrock, and so on) on goods or wrappers without some sufficient indication of the foreign origin of the goods, on the ground that they are likely to deceive the purchaser as to the origin of goods,3.    Under the existing Merchandise Marks lot, prooedure must be of a criminal oharacter and be taken in a Court of Summary Jurisdiction.-     The Bill proposes to give any person aggrieved the right to the alternative of taking proceedings in the High Court for the recovery of damages or for an injunction, the object being to enable a judgment to be secured which will definitely lay down the law as to descriptions which in future cases are to be regarded as false.?4.     It was recommended in addition by the Merchandise Marks Committee that local authorities should be authorised either to prosecute under the Act (as the Board of Trade is already empowered to do) or, where the description applied to goods is alleged tc be a false indication that the goods were produced in a particular district, to proceed alternatively for an injunction in the High Court;   but I do not propose to incor-porate these recommendations in the Bill, in view of the necessity for economy in public expenditure-    For the same reason I have not] adopted the Committee:s recommendation that British representatives! abroad should be empowered to take proceedings in foreign
470courts for the suppression of false indications of British origin and that the expenses of such proceedings should be borne, in suitable cases, by the Exchequer.5o     The existing law prevents the application to-goods of false trade descriptions or the sale of goods to which false trade descriptions are applied.   , It is proposed to bring within the sphere of the Merchandise Marks legislation, not merely an application to goods of such descriptions, but also an indirect mis-description of goods whether oral or contained in any advertisement, catalogue, or other document, or in any trade name or style.     It will, no doubt, prove difficult in particular cases to prove oral mis-description of goods but it would seem desirable that where such can be proved, the ordinary Merchandise Marks law should prov/de the same remedy as in cases in which there is a written or printed mis-description.In view of the absolute unanimity of the Committee which considered these questions and in view also of the growing demand that manufacturers in this country should be protected from the unfair competition of foreign goods, especially foreign goods masquerading as British, I have every reason to hope thai* the proposals in this Bill will not encounter any veffy serious opposition.Whilst it is not proposed at this stage to repeal the existing Act and replace It by another, I am myself disposed think that when the present bill has become law it might be desirable to pass a consolidating measure embodying the whole existing legislation dealing with Merchandise&apos;Marks.I have promised legislation early next Session, and in my-opinion this Bill should be introduced at the same time as the Safeguarding of Industries Bill, as the   enforcement of marks of
471origin in oertain oases will operate in some degree as a safeguards     However,.in procedure, priority should he given to the latter.R. S. H.27. 1. 21.
