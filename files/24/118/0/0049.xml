This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.217SECRET.OP. 2447.THE CABINET.EFFECT OF THE WAR PENSIONS ACT, 1920, UPON OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS IN IRELAND AND ELSEWHERE.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.The application of the War Pensions Act, 1920, to officers and men serving in__7Ir. *.and and other areas where hostilities may be in progress at the official end of the Gen. No. war, may produce highly anomalous results.   I circulate for the consideration of the    8820 Cabinet a memorandum explaining the situation.w. s. c.The Wab Office,13th January, 1921.At the present time officers and soldiers who have been injured and the dependants of those who have been killed, are still continuing to receive disability benefits on the scale brought in by the Ministry of Pensions for the great war. Thirty days after the official end of the war, the administration of all grants for new cases of disability will, under the War Pensions Act, 1920, be transferred to the service departments. The scale of benefits for post-war disability has been under the consideration of Mr. Baldwin&apos;s Committee and will be less favourable than the special scale introduced for the war. Thus a casualty arising 29 days after the date of the official end of the war will be more liberally dealt with than a precisely similar casualty arising 31 days after it. If the date arrives during a continuing state of hostilities in any part of the world, including Ireland, it will not be possible, in the opinion of the War Office, suddenly to lower the scale of benefits. It is therefore considered that any casualties arising during the continuance of such&apos; hostilities should give rise to grants at the rates laid down for the great war.The same principle would presumably apply to Naval and Air Force personnel so far as the element of continuity exists in their case.The War Office wrote officially to the Treasury on 20th September last, proposing that this should be done, without fresh legislation, by the use of the &quot;Dispensing Warrant,&quot; under which rates of pension, &amp;c, other than those laid down by the Royal Warrant for Pay, &amp;c., of the Army, may be granted in special circumstances with Treasury approval. It is understood that the Treasury now desires the matter to be laid before the Cabinet.The question, in its application to Ireland, has recently been raised in the House of Commons and consideration has been promised. (Answer to Captain Loseby, 23rd November, 1920, Official Report, column 198.)(021/(33)   100  1/21   lT&amp;S,Ltd  8882wo
