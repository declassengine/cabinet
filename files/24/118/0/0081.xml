P. 2179. &quot;  8THE CABINET.CONCENTRATION OP GOVERNMENT LAND VALUATION.JOINT MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR ANDTHE MINISTER OF MUNITIONS.With reference to the final conclusions of Cabinet 75 (20), of 22ml December, p N which differ from those reached at the end of the discussion, relating to the concentration of valuation work for Government Departments in the. Inland Revenue Department, X circulate a memorandum by Sir Howard Frank, Chairman of the Disposals Board and Director-General of Lands, which illustrates some of the practical difficulties which may be anticipated unless this revised decision is modified.If the Chancellors suggestions are accepted, the Secretary of State for War and the Minister of Munitions cannot fairly be expected to accept responsibility for carrying on the work, nor for the very heavy financial loss to the country which must; result if the right men are not retained to see it through.W. S. C. 1.Tee War Office,2 ith January, 1921.I. Conclusion 1 (a) of Cabinet 75 (20), as circulated in its draft form, was as follows : &quot; That the duties now assigned to the Inland Revenue Valuation Department should remain undisturbed.&quot;This, I understand, represented the sense of the Cabinefs conclusions. 2. The conclusion as subsequently circulated in its final form was altered as follows : -&quot; (a.) That all valuation work for the Government (except that connected with certain war transactions) should be concentrated in one department, and that that department should be the Inland Revenue Department, as reeom-mendecl by, &amp;c.(b.) That the Inland Revenue should not be responsible for purchase and sale or management of lands, &amp;c.&quot;3. The suggestion contained in the altered decision that, in the case of sales and purchases, one department should be responsible for making the valuations and another for conducting the negotiations, is one that no business man versed in lands transactions would favour. The position of the negotiating department would be an impossible one, if it had to negotiate on the basis of a valuation made by a department which was not in any way responsible (or carrying out the transactions.4. Under such conditions there would be no possibility of securing really capable surveyors of high standing for any department to which, as the result of the inquiry referred to in 1 (c) of the final conclusions referred to, it may be decided to entrust the purchase, sale and management of lands on behalf of the Government, and the attempt to concentrate this work in one department on these lines would be bound to fail.5. The following propositions would, I think, be accepted without hesitation by any person of wide practical experience in land transactions :-(i.) No surveyor of high standing can be expected to negotiate satisfactorily onthe basis of figures for which he is not responsible, (ii.) Valuations of real property for practical purposes can only be made by surveyors engaged in the actual practice of their profession.(B21/52)   100   j/21   H&amp;S,Ltd.  88Slwo
To this I would add another proposition which seems to me to be entitled to equally ready acceptance.(iii.) Valuations intended to be used for revenue purposes would command, as well as deserve, more confidence if ninde by a department responsible for the purchase, sale and management of lauds than if made by a department merely responsible for the collection of revenue.G. There can be no doubt that the distrust with which the valuations made by the Inland Revenue Valuation Office were regaided was due largely to the fact that they were for the most part made by men who were out of touch with the practical side of their profession outside valuations, and were acting under a department which was only interested in land from the point of view of taxation.7. If the Chancellor of the Exchequer considers that the advantages of having valuations for revenue purposes made by the Inland Revenue Department outweighs the disadvantages, and the Cabinet accepts that view, I do not wish to say more on this point, except that the subject was brought before the Cabinet at short notice ; neither the Secretary of State for War nor the Minister of Munitions was able to be present and there was not sufficient time for a reply to the Chancellors Memorandum (CP. 2223) to be put in; had the Ministers present seen this reply, which was in draft, it is possible that the conclusions might have been modified.8. For the reasons I have already given I am convinced that the acceptance of the Chancellors suggestion would necessarily result in the failure of any attempt to concentrate in one department the responsibility for the purchase, sale and management of lands on behalf of the Government.That such concentration is desirable on general grounds I am convinced, and in their previous Memorandum the Secretary of State for War and the Minister of Munitions (CP. 2128) have pointed out that it was also essential for the purpose of satisfactorily completing the enormous mass of complicated transactions for which the Lands Directorate is at present responsible. The Chancellor of the Exchequer admits in paragraph 5 of his Memorandum (CP. 2223) that this work could not be carried out by the Inland Revenue Valuation Department. The Secretary of State for War and the Minister of Munitions have explained that they cannot retain the staff necessary to carry it to completion in existing circumstances.H. Fra^k.
