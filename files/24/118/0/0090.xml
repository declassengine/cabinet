(P 558) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 10622ith January 1921.(Received 5 p.in.)Priority A.11 IS.   Secret.   Afghanistan.   Following from Dobbs, 21st January :-7 First official sitting took place yesterday morning. Tarsi opened proceedings by stating that Afghanistan agreed generally to principles of Mussoorie aide-memoire, but wished various modifications. He. suggested that we should start by attempt to draw up draft treaty which could be then discussed in detail, and asked whether I would prefer to furnish draft or whether Afghans should do so. I said that I preferred latter. Afghans then, produced one by one first five clauses of proposed draft treaty with two draft schedules referred to in certain clauses. Whole of sitting was devoted to verbal elucidation of ambiguous phrases in various clauses in answer to questions put by me, I said that 1 would not comment on any part of draft until whole scope of proposals had been communicated and meaning made clear. They promise to produce remaining six clauses at next sitting, 22nd January. When that has been done I will telegraph synopsis. First Afghan clause is affirmation of independence. Second affirms right of; each party to have Legation capitals, London and Kabul. Third, with schedule, deals with consulates, and contains minute details, some very curious, regarding restriction on Ministers and Consuls and their status. Fourth gives Afghanistan right import without hindrance aims, military material, machinery, manufacture (of) thereof, and telegraph material and the like, to any extent to which she may be able to purchase from any part of the world. Fifth, with schedule, deals with commercial matters and trade agents generally on lines of our aide-memoire, but adds trade agent, Parachinar. Tarsi warned me that six clauses not yet (? communicated) contain exceedingly debatable matters, and it seems likely that we are in for lengthy discussion.   Amir did not attend Conference.&quot;
