Committee on Irish Affairs my survey for the week ended the 17th instantsGMBRAL STATE OF THE COtTOBY. Statistics of outrages..;      The total number of serious outrages reported for the week ended the 15th instant was 57, a considerablyflower figure than that for the previous week (103).   The decrease was mainly due to a falling off in the number of raids on mails, and to the Gestation 6f raids upon the offices of rate collectors, a new form of oinn Fein activity noted in my last week&apos;s report.   From a comparison of the weekly figures on the attached schedule with totals in the first and last columns it will be seen that attacks&apos; on property no longer play a very prominent part in the campaign of lawlessness but I regret to state that no improvement is yet noticeable in the figures of the casualties inflicted week by week upon the Crown forces.Police casualties for the past week numbered ,1.3.. .(3 killed and 19 wounded).Two of the fatal casualties were sustained in an ambush of a police lorry near limerick on the 13th instant, and the third oase was that Of a member of the Ulster special
Constabulary who was killed in an ambush near Cullyhanna, Bessbrooic District, (Co, Armagh) on the same date,   a civilian postman who was conveying mails under &quot;escort of -the police&apos; patrol was, also killed on the latter occasion.iive attacks on occupied R.I.C. barracks vere made during the week.   The attack &apos;w&amp;s unsuccessful in every case and resulted in no   o&amp;staltiGS to the defending garrisons or damage to the barracks.   These results afford gratifying evidence of the improved efficiency of the Koyal Irish Constabulary as a fighting force.On tho 11th instant Hook lover Lighthouse, (fiew Boss District, Co. -:.&apos;exford) mas raided by a party of armed men who took away an electric battery, 220 feet-of electric cable and a galvanometer.I am glad to mention a very satisfactory military operation in the Martial Law. area, the news of whioh has just c*me to hand.    It appears that a detachment of theBissex .Regiment surprised a p-arty of Volunteers yesterday in the act of preparing an ambush near Timoleague (Go. Cork) and after an exchange of shots in which no casualties vere inflicted ou either side, succeeded in surrounding and capturing twenty-five of the raiders.   ilhla reverse- should have a ver, -salutary effect in checking the activities of tho republican Volunteers in the 7/est Cork district whioh has boon one tt the most disturbed parts of the county.oeveral important seizures of rebel arms and ammunition were affected In the Jiartial Lav, ..roa during: the week. The seizures included a Lewis Gun v:ith 4 fully charged magazines, 1,GOO rounds of rifle and revolver ammunition, and a quantity of bombs, gelignite and other explosives.*** ***
Fifty-one arrests for outrages and political offences were effected during the week ended the 15th instant.

Trials of Civilians by Court Martial.

Seventy-five trials of civilians by Court Martial took place during the week, and sixty-one convictions were obtained. Sentence of ten years penal servitude was imposed in three cases, for the offence of Kidnapping a Great Northern Railway signalman of the 29th October last, in connection with the recent Railway Dispute. It was provided that each of the prisoners was armed with a revolver when committing the offence. Seven was imposed in two cases, and three years penal servitude years penal servitude /in one case, for the possession of arms and ammunition. Imprisonment with hard labour was imposed in thirty-three cases and without hard labour in twelve cases. Fines in amounts ranging from 10/- to £20 were imposed in nine cases and in one case the ? was bound over in his own recognizances of £50 with two sureties of £25 each to be of good behaviour for six months. In fourteen cases the accused was acquitted, and in one case of conviction the sentence was remitted by the confirming Officer.

Orders for Interment.

One hundred and thirty Orders for internment were made during the week, brining the total number of persons now interned to 1,429. An advisory Committee has been set as under Regulation 14? of the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act, composed of Mr. Justice Ross. His Honour Judge Doyle. K.C., Recorded of Galway, and Mr. W. Sullivan, Resident Magistrate. This Committee hears all applications from internees who may consider themselves wrongly suspected and interned.

STATE OF THE POLICE FORCES.

0 90 0 fj b1-st v,&apos;(?ek.        The net lncr^ese in the strength of the Auxiliary Division is 54.      rl?he following,ars the usual particulars of wastage end recruitment.

RAILWAY SITUATION.

The re-instatement of the suspended employees on the Great Northern Railway is still delayed by the men&apos;s  refusal to comply with the Company&apos;s requirement that an individual application must be made by every man who desires to he taken back.  About five hundred men are affected and I understand that the National Union of Railwaymen are supporting them in their refusal to make application, and that the matter is at present under consideration by the Executive of the Union.

The strike of boilermakers in Dublin which is holding up the re-instatement of a number of men on the Midland Great Western system still continues, but it is hoped that a settlement may he reached as tho result of a conference, between the parties concerned which will probably take place within a few days.

JURISDICTION Of KING&apos;S BENCH IN COURT MARTIAL CASES.

An important legal question affecting the powers of Courts Martial has been raised on an application to the King&apos;s Bench Division of the High Court to quash the proceedings in the case of Jospeh Murphy who was tried by Court Martial and convicted of tho murder of a soldier in Cork, and is now lying under sentence of death in Cork Prison. It is alleged on the prisoner&apos;s behalf that the Court Martial wrongly refused permission to his Counsel to cross-examine a witness on a material point, and the further question arises whether the High Court have jurisdiction to over-rule the decision of the Court Martial.  The case has been adjourned for hearing before the Lord Chief Justice, and three other judges of the High Court on Monday next when the Attorney-General will appear on behalf of the Crown.
