Any plan calculated to postpone the stabilisation of,the Foreign Exchanges seems to me to be open to grave objection.The main cau ;r of unemployment in this country is not the volume of foreign imports, whioh,. i s far less than it was before the war, but the lack of foreign orders.   To what is this lack of foreign orders due ?   Plainly -to the impoverish-ment of the foreign customer.   And how is the foreign customer to be enriched ?   ITo less plainly by the sale at a profit of his goons abroad.   The more gooes he can sell abroad, the more easily will he be able to obtain the foreign credits necessary to finance his purchases from us.   or, in other wares, the cure for the disease of the Mark is not the exclusion *b  those imports which are favourably.affected by the disease - for this course in truth only postpones the recovery - but tief encourage ment of imports from, and the provision of sterling credits to, those countries whirH were once large customers for our gooes ane are anxious to become; large customers for our goods again.&apos;.If this argument be correct, is it not clear that the recovery of our great staple industries which.are starving for foreign orders will be retarded by the measures which the president of the &quot;Board of Trade proposes to take in order to help the far less important industries which are now suffering
by the competition of goods aided by a premium arising out of the state of the exchanges ?   The argument is quite clearly     f Understood by working people engaged in the trades which used to do business with Germany.   They know why the Germans cannot buy their goods and they know al30 that the sooner and more profitably the Germans can sell other goods here, the sooner and more profitably they will be able to se 3d their go go. s to the Germans.   The workers in the boot trade, who used to sell their boots to Germany, know that every order giver: by an Englishman for German brushes is a potential.order given by a German for $newish boots, and consequently that every measure taken to prevent the less of employment in. the brush industry is a measure to perpetuate the loss of employ-ment in the boot industry;It is common ground that the key industries are to be. protected through infancy and if the protection is to be adequate, the effects of the depreciated   Hark must clearly be taken into account, but when&apos; the goods enumerated in the First Schedule of the Bill have been duly shielded an. the field of German- competition in our markets has been correspondingly redueec, what chances of recovery do we leave to Germany under a plan which threatens ^the remainder of her sailing power in Great Britain ?   For these reasons I trust.that such duties as may be thought necessary to counterbalance the premium arising out of the collapsed exchanges in ex-enemy countries, should. be confined to the- key industries enumerated in the First Schedule of the Bill and should not be indefinitely : , extended as is now-proposed.The restoration of the purchasing pov/er of Central Europe being admittedly the radical cure for British unemploy-ment, the real ^safeguarding cf Industries&quot; will not be effected&apos;by any Bill which v/e can pass through parliament. The&apos;Indispensable measures to that end are, I think, generally acknowledged to be - first, the fixing of the.-German. . Indemnity.- on a moderate baeia, and secondly, -the, stabilisation of the Austrian Exchange under pome scheme designed to balance
revenue and expenditure in Austria a .d to prevent the further issue of paper in that country.   To curtail the power of Germany to pay her debts in the only commodities which she is now in a position to send us is one of those measures which, like the Rent&apos; Restriction Acts, while giving immediate and partial relief in the long run aggravate the evil which they are. designed to cure.(Sgd.) &quot;H.A.L.
