Lec* 1920) Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty *I am confident that the scheme suggested by the Prime Minister is not only the right one but the only one which will succeed.If ex-Service men can get 3 to 5, or I will go as far as 10, acres of land they would be able      In conjunction with other employment to make a starty hut 30 to 50 acres is neither one thing nor the other, and there are already proofs in my own county of approaching failuresIn addition, notice must, be taken of the gact that in many of our parishes all the land is under cultivation and is being well farmed and therefore land for the small holdings can only be obtained by the surrender of land by the large farmers - in other words by giving up their farms.   This they are very unwilling to do and their landlords decline to evict thenuIf the smaller system were adopted I am quite satisfied that if conferences were held in every parish a good many demands of 5 to 5 acres could be met by mutual arrangement but when It comes to 30 or 50 it is impossible unless you evict farmers who are doing their duty$ cultivating their land well and see no reason why they should bo turned out, at what would be an undoubted heavy loss to themselves.(Initialled)   W. H* L.1*1.21.
