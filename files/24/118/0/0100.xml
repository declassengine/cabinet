CP,   2493n.J5Vcmi Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, i.loo27/ii January 1021.(Received 3.30 pan.)Clear the line.129 S.   Secret.   Afghanistan,   following (to in Dobbs, elated 25th January : &quot;Second purl; ol! ninth clause contains mutual undertaking to cause no trouble in territories ol: either after rearrangement under clause 8. Tenth clause provides Britain shall promise to amend Turkish Treaty so as to assure well-being ol Turkey, freedom of liedjaz, Syria and Mesopotamia. Eleventh cancels all previous treaties. Draft was ludicrously vague aud most of sitting was taken up elucidating its meaning, while 1 again refused to express my opinion. In support of clause 8, Afghans produced a petition signed by certain Afridi, Mohmand, and Wazir Maliks, well known as Afghan pensioners. On conclusion, 1 pointed out that British Government had sent Mission to Kabul, relying on Amir&apos;s statement that he accepted principle of aide-memoire with minor exceptions. Afghan draft Articles (? differed omitted) so fundamentally from memoirethai, when reported, its effect might be my immediate recall, I asked, therefore, for time for consideration., date of next Conference being fixed by me. Tarsi consented to * latter, but begged me not to take so serious (? a) view, as the draft was mere paper scheme put forward for discussion. My next move will be to tackle Afghans (? personalty) on seventh, eighth and tenth clause, taking up eighth lirst. if they persist iu tiieir demand (V it will be) useless to prolong the negotiations.

Afghans are, however, in close daily consultation with Jamal, and situation is doubtful.&quot;Following sent to Dobbs (? 27t.li -January):.....-&quot; Your telegram of the 2oth January, K:M. 19 C, first and second- parts. Line you have taken is entirely approved. If you think it would strengthen your hands, you are authorised to inform Tarsi and the Amir as follows :--&quot;It was not without much difficulty that Government of India succeeded in securing authority from His Majesty s Government to send a mission to Kabul. They only succeeded because they were able to point to Amir&apos;s pledge regarding acceptance of basis of aide-memoire (? and) memoranda, and again to Tarsi&apos;s pledge regarding Waziristan, that memoranda had solved all questions, and that difficulties which might cause delay would not arise. Indeed, without such pledges, Government of India would not have countenanced mission at all. It now appears that -Afghanistan proposes to scrap these pledges&quot;. Your reports of draft treaty put forward by Tarsi are, of course, being communicated to His Majesty&apos;s Government, and Government of India are now considering- whole matter. Your further reports will be awaited, but you must be prepared in meanwhile for receipt of orders of instant recall. Indeed, if pledges of Amir and Foreign Minister are so lightly (? regarded), Government of India begin to doubt whether it would be worth while entering into any treaty at all.&quot; Actual wording may be altered at your discretion.&quot;(Tit.Its
