Five definite applications have been refused because the Ministry cf Labour wore unable to certify prospective serious unemployment,,     Other prospective applicants have been told not to apply because it was ascertained that the Ministry of Labour would, not certify. The total of tho Grants which the Committee have hitherto approved is  35,37.5. ..  The work so aidod is oxpectod to employ 2,400 men for 13 weeks including 740 working half-time. No definite applications havo yet been received from either Scotland, or Ireland,The Forks aided are usually sewerage works, the laying out of Cemeteries and Recreation Grounds, the painting of Public Buildings, and similar minor worksoApart from the slowness of Local Authorities to move, thereasons why so few and so small applications have been made tothe Committee appear to be -(1)    The inadequacy of the contribution which the Committee are empowered to mako to the cost of work,(2).    The poverty of tho Local -Authorities., many of theareas in which unemployment is most rife being already rated very high,.(3)    The difficulty of raising money for further works &apos; in view of the demands for roads and housing,(4)    The limitation.of the Committee 1s powers in regard tb the Schemes which they are able to aid.
On this point there can he little doubt that if the Committee had power to aid roads other than those which are in fact being aided by the Ministry of Transport, many Local Authorities would submit applicationso   Although it is stated, in the Committee!s circulars to Local Authorities; that they have no power to aid Roads, nevertheless frequent enquiries are received on the point, and in some cases even definite applications include requests for assistance in the Improvement of roads other than arterial and Class One main roads.   Two instances may be quoted which have occurred within the last few days0     The Borough of Poplar submitted a scheme of work of which the total cost was estimated to be  30,7-46*   The main item in this scheme was picking and- rolling macadamised roads at an estimated cost of  16;250.,     The Leeds Corporation, who sent a deputation to the Committee yesterday, submitted three definite schemes: one for walks in Cemeteries and Parks; one for painting Public Buildings\ and one for reconstruct ing seven miles of roads, the last being estimated to cost. 101,000 and to employ 120 men for six months.   In both the Leeds and. the Poplar cases the Committee had of course no alternative but to say that the Road schemes were outside their terms of reference-, -Again.; it is&apos; understood from the Ministry of Transport that they have some 30 road schemes which could be put at once before the Committee if the Committee had any power to deal with thorn.     Such schemes would, of course only be approved if they covered areas where serious unemployment is. certified to exist *It appears so probable as to be almost certain that unless the limitations imposed on the Committee are removed in -some direction, the sum placed at tho Committee.1 s disposal will ha^c no soeertyeffect . .
promoting or^l^yment.    One ;way of easing the situatirn would&apos; seem to ho to empower the Committee&apos; to deal with roads other than those which the Ministry of Transport are in fact able to aid on the grounds -(a) that there is reason to think that&apos;a large number of sohemes would he iramodiately available *.(b) that it is work whioh can be soon put in hand, employs a oonsidorablo amount o$: labour.The Committee vould of course work in the closest collaboration with the Ministry of Transport so as to ensure that grants are not mado from two sources for the same work and that only suoh Road&apos; work is aided by the Committee as the Ministry of Transport, being the technical department concerned, would approve&apos;,&apos;unemployment Grants Committee,. 20, Carlton House Terrace,sJanuary 12th,. 1921.
