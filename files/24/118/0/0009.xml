L 1.7    N. nuinent is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1921.tflALL.SECRET.PROPOSED MODIFICATIONS OF LORD MILNER&apos;S REPORT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN my remarks on Lord Milner&apos;s Report on Egypt at the recent Cabinet, I said that I was prepared to advise the acceptance of the following principles underlying Lord Milner&apos;s proposals : (a.) The substitution of a treaty of alliance for the existing Protectorate.(6.) The recognition, within certain defined limits, of the independence of Egypt.On the other hand, I felt serious apprehensions and was prepared to suggest definite modifications in respect of certain points which I specified in the discussion. They were the following :  1. The management of foreign affairs, over which there appeared to me to beestablished an insufficient British supervision. 2. The position of the High Commissioner, which appeared to me to be, so to speak, suspended in the air. 3. The future location of the British forces, a portion of which it seemed to me(concurring therein with Lord Allen by) imperative to keep for a term ofyears, at any rate, in the neighbourhood of Cairo and Alexandria. 4. The ambiguous position of the suggested Financial and Judicial Advisers. 5. The desirability of establishing some contact with and control over the Ministryof the Interior.6. The necessity for providing that no foreigners shall in future be appointed to the Egyptian army, police or civil service without the consent of Great Britain, a point about which Lord Milner thought that no difficulty would be raised.7. The desirability of guaranteeing as far as possible the stability of the constitutional monarchy and the succession to the Throne in Egypt.8. There was also the point, raised by the Prime Minister, viz., the advisability of providing in some way for the association of the Egypt of the future with the fabric of the British Empire.I have sought to secure these points, not by a draft treaty, which would at present be premature, but by the suggestion of a series of textual amendments of or additions to the Memorandum printed on pages 24-26 of Lord Milner&apos;s Report, and containing the bases of the policy recommended by him and his colleagues.My alterations or additions are printed in italics.Modifications in the Milner Memorandum. 4(i). Last sentence to read as follows :  /Egypt will undertake not to adopt in relation to foreign countries an attitude which is inconsistent with the alliance or will create difficulties - for Great Britain, and will also undertake not to enter into any agreement with a foreign Power which is prejudicial to British interests.In furtherance of this undertaking Egypt ivill at all times frankly and fully consult the British representative in Egypt on all questions relating to foreign affairs, and will not enter into any agreement with a foreign Power without such consultation. Great Britain on her side will frankly and fully consult the Egyptian Government in regard to foreign affairs in any way affecting the interests of Egypt[5272]
2and will also, through her representatives abroad, support and further the interests of Egypt and will collaborate with the Egyptian representatives to this end.(The above addition, while rendered palatable to the Egyptian Government by the reciprocal form in which it is couched, is intended to prevent a foreign policy, clandestine, or inimical to British interests, being pursued at Cairo by the Egyptian Foreign Office or the foreign representatives there, behind the back or over the head of the High Commissioner.)Add the following new paragraph: 4 (ii). As a temporary measure and until the new regime set up by the treaty is firmly established, Great Britain shall also enjoy the right of using the existing military establishments in the neighbourhood of Cairo and Alexandria for the maintenance of troops, and shall also bt entitled to maintain a guard for the protection of the Abu Zaabal wireless telegraphy station in Qalioubia.No rights similar to those conferred on Great Britain by these provisions shall be conferred on any foreign Power.(The first of these two clauses will enable British military contingents, in accordance with the strongly-expressed opinions of Lord Allenby and General Congreve, to be maintained, say for a period of five or three years, either in the Kasr-el-Nil Barracks in Cairo, or perhaps preferably in the Abbassia Barracks near the Heliopolis Aerodrome a few miles outside, also in the Mustafa Pasha Barracks near Alexandria and in the neighbourhood of the Aboukir Aerodrome.The second clause is intended to prevent Consular Guards from being placed by any foreign Power for the protection of their representatives or nationals in Cairo or elsewhere.)4 (Ha). Add the following paragraph : The use at all times of one or more aerodromes, as may be arranged, shall be secured to British aircraft. Great Britain shall also enjoy the use of the A bu Zaabal wireless telegraphy station in Qalioubia).(This paragraph is intended to provide for the use of the above stations which are vital to our aerial and wireless communications, in times of peace as well as in times of war.)4 (iii) to read as follows: Egypt will appoint, in consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Government, a Financial Adviser, to whom shall be entrusted in due course the powers at present exercised by the Commissioners of the Debt. He shall be kept fully informed on all matters connected with the Department, and shall enjoy the right of access to the Minister.4 (iv) to read as follows: Egypt will appoint, in consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Government, an official in the Ministry of the Interior and an official in the Ministry of Justice. Each of these officials shall be kept fully informed on all matters connected with his Department, and shall enjoy the right of access to the Minister. They shall be responsible respectively under the Minister for the conduct of matters relating to the maintenance of order, and to the administration of the law as affecting foreigners.(I have eliminated from the Milner Report the disputed passage about the liberty of the Egyptian Government to consult the Financial Adviser which they might perhaps have declined to exercise and have sought by the new words to provide for his being fully acquainted with all that passes in the Department, and having access at all times to the Minister.I suggest similar provisions for the two officials in the Ministries of the Interior and Justice, but I do not call them Advisers. They may or may not be Under-Secretaries of State,   I further assign a definite sphere of responsibility to each.Incidentally and this in my view is most important the existence and powers of these three officials will enable the High Commissioner to be kept in sufficiently close contact with what is passing in the Egyptian administration.)4 (viii). New article.Egypt will undertake not to appoint any foreign officers or officials to any of the public services without the previous concurrence of the British Representative.
6. Add the following paragraph : The constitutional Head of the State and the succession to the Throne, being already determined, will not be affected by the new Organic Statute, and will lie outside the scope of the legislature to be set up thereunder.1.1. New article :-The relations between Great Britain and Egypt established by the treaty referred to in article 3 will, from the moment when such treaty comes into force, supersede the Protectorate declared by Great Britain on the 18th December, 1914. Great Britain will communicate the terms of the treaty to foreign Powers, and will support an application by Egypt for admission to the League of Nations.It will be seen that I have not provided specifically in any of the above amendments for the implied incorporation of Egypt in the British Empire. I would propose in the explanatory despatch to Lord Allenby to invite him to place before the Egyptian Government the earnest desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government, while fully maintaining the independence of Egypt, to see her Prime Minister take part in any future meetings of the Imperial Conference.Finally as to procedure. It is, I think, clear that the Milner Report must be published ; but it is also clear that if it were to be published now, or alone, any attempt to modify or amend it, if such be decided upon by His Majesty&apos;s Government, would be rendered well-nigh impossible, while it would become the irreducible minimum for which the Egyptian Nationalists would contend. I suggest therefore, as the best procedure in the circumstances, that after deciding whether or not and to what extent to accept my amendments, a despatch should be sent to Lord Allenby enclosing-Lord Milner&apos;s Report, setting out the objections of His Majesty&apos;s Government to some of the articles, and stating our views as to the further points for which provision must be made ; the despatch might terminate with a copy of the Memorandum or &quot;Basis of an Understanding &quot; containing the modifications which we think necessary. The despatch would conclude with an invitation to the Egyptian Government to send the promised delegation to England to draw up the proposed treaty in the early spring. The despatch, with its enclosures could then be published simultaneously in England and Egypt. But in the meantime we could telegraph to Lord Allenby the modifications on which we are disposed to insist, and obtain his opinion upon them before finally incorporating them in our draft.CURZON OF KEDLESTON.January 1, 1921.*
