Circulated by the Secretary of State for India. For reference only.SECRET.I circulate, with reference to my Memorandum on Indian Military Expenditure (CP. 2362), the following extracts from telegrams and correspondence.X? ... E. S. M.\ - 3.nd January 1921.Papers relating to the Size, Composition, and Organisation of the Armyin India.Extract horn Letter No. il/. 23000 of the 21lh June 1919 from the india Office to the War Office.Sir,In continuation of the correspondence ending with my letter of 31st January,,\T v c - i coo i a/i i loio ^o. 2918/19, I am directed to forward for 1 No. 1, Special, of 22nd March 1911), rr &apos;.      c ,    .        r.&apos;  1     &apos; the consideration of the Army Council a copy ofa Despatch1 received from the Government of India on the subject of the Army to bemaintained in India after the war.Mr. Montagu   .   :   .   .   would be glad to receive the views of the ArmyCouncil on the estimate made by the Government of India of the size of the force tobe maintained from Indian revenues for the immediate protection of India, viz. (a) a field army of four squadrons of aeroplanes, six cavalry brigades, six divisions, three frontier brigades and necessary army troops, and(b) troops required for the maintenance of internal security.He would also like to be favoured with the views of the Army Council as to the adequacy for the purpose of providing the proposed field army, of the total number of units detailed in Appendix I. to the Despatch, especially as regards artillery and technical units, and as to the proposal that the reserve of the field army should be differently constituted from, and less well equipped than, the striking portion of the field army.For the reason stated above, Mr. Montagu does not propose at present to discuss para. 4 of the Government of InchVs Despatch. He desires at this stage merely to remark that, owing to causes not fully known to them at the time the Despatch was written,, the cost of the forces to be maintained at India&apos;s expense is likely considerably to exceed 26,500,000Z.Letter No. 0164/4262 (M.0. 3) of the 1st July 19.19 from the War Office to the India Office.Sir,In reply to your letter M. 23000 of 24th June, I am commanded by the Army Council to state that in their opinion the present situation on the North-West Frontier of India is very typical of that which the forces required for the immediate protection of India should be designed to meet.I am, therefore, to suggest that the Government of India should be asked to wire whether, as a result of their experience of the requirements of the present situation, including the possibility of an advance to Kabul and Kandahar, they still adhere to the opinion expressed in their Despatch No. 1 Special, dated 22nd March 1919, as to the strength of the field army required by India for her own needs.A further reply to your letter of 24th June will be sent in a few days.Telegram No. 2629 of btli, July 1919 from Secretary of State for Indiato Viceroy, Army Department.Your Despatch of the 22nd March, No. 1, Special, of 1919.Present situation on frontier is typical one which forces required for immediate protection of India are designed to meet. As a result of present experiences, including possibility of advance to Kandahar and Kabul, do you adhere to your estimate of army required by India for her own needs ?   Telegraph reply.Copy of Telegram No. 11365 of 21st August 1919 from Viceroy, Army Department,to Secretary of State for India.Your telegram of the 5th ultimo, No. 2629.1. We agree that in respect of number and quality of the enemy&apos;s forces and the degree of resistance encountered, the present campaign may be regarded as typical. To that extent, therefore, it may be held to represent conditions foreshadowed in our 3009-2     100  12.20 A
Despatch 1, Special, dated 22ml March. In respect of our forces, however, the situation is, in our opinion, far from being typical. Hostilities were forced upon us when the resources of India hud been depleted by a long war. Demobilisation was in progress and large numbers of men on leave. Internal disturbances necessitated the temporary redistribution of troops and hampered the working of our railways. Moreover, the conditions envisaged in para. 7 of Despatch have still to be fulfilled. TJie degree of mobility is low. Units are weak and in (corrupt group) eases of weariness. The forces engaged are not yet equipped up to standard demanded for modern war. There are deficiencies in equipment such as aeroplanes, mechanical transport and machine guns. The proportion of artillery is small and in some cases the equipment is obsolete. Road and rail communication on the North-West Frontier are undeveloped and will remain so until we are able to complete the improvements contemplated when our original estimate was framed.2. The chief lessons to be derived from the recent operations are : (a) It must be recognised that India is exposed to the sudden aggression of theAfghan army as opposed to belief previously held that some notice of Afghan unfriendjiness*would usually be afforded.(b) The Frontier Militia have, with few exceptions, proved unreliable and dangerous, and have therefore been of little assistance as a covering force behind which our field army could concentrate. This has compelled our field army to fight during process of concentration, thus disturbing pre-arranged plan.(c) Hot weather campaigning has demonstrated low limit at which divisionaldaily requirements were calculated. Modern soldier assumes as necessities comforts which were formally classed as luxuries ; to satisfy these conditions an increased scale of maintenance transport is demanded.(d) The great effect of modern howitzers, aircraft and machine guns in frontierwarfare.   The maintenance of these equipments entails more transport.(e) Necessity for providing mechanical transport on a scale sufficient to satisfy(c) and (d).(/) Present shoriage of mechanical transport drivers, both British and Indian, also the difficulty of keeping British drivers lit for continuous work. These are disabilities which should tend to diminish in course of time (? as omitted) the use of mechanical transport in India becomes more general.(g) The dependence of modern armies upon civil resources and large areas from which these resources have to be drawn, which makes machinery of mobilisation increasingly difficult.o. These lessons emphasise the desiderata postulated in paras. 7 and .12 of our Special Despatch and demand: (a) Immediate readiness on the part of striking force; (6) ample supply of mechanical and animal transport; (c) redistribution of our regular troops so as to provide efficient covering forces and thus protect the concentration of our field army from disturbance; (d) extension of our broad gauge rail and road system to maintain our covering troops and to enable the rapid concen-tration of the field forces and their maintenance when concentrated.5. Subject to completion of the desiderata mentioned in para. 3 above, Commandor-in-Chief adheres to the estimate given in No. 1, Special, Despatch, which he considers sufficient for the capture of Jalalabad and the maintenance of an active defence elsewhere. He again desires to emphasise the great advantage of a move on Jalalabad, which can only be achieved by acceptance of standard of preparations which was postulated in that estimate. Pending attainment of that standard estimate may be temporarily exceeded, in order to compensate for the lack of mobility. We are in agreement with commander-in-Ohief.0. As regards possibility of an advance on. Kandahar and Kabul, we offer following remarks : (a) Capacity for an immediate advance on Kandahar and Kabul was outside our previous estimate; (b) time is the determining factor of the problem. We do not consider it-would be legitimate on either financial or general grounds to maintain permanently as part of our peace organisation the complete establishments and equipments necessary to ensure an advance on Kandahar and Kabul being undertaken immediately war is declared. Even the present operations, handicapped as we have been, have not established necessity for this ; (c) in any case it is clear that the maintenance of the standard of preparation requisite to follow up the advance to Jalalabad by a prompt advance on Kabul and simultaneously to
advance on. Kandahar, other than by railway extensions, is one beyond our present financial capacity. Moreover, such a standard should not be necessary if you can guarantee us reinforcements of aircraft, transport and equipment, &amp;c, within six weeks or two months. We recognise that the homo source of reinforcements hay failed us on present occasion, but it would be unreasonable to reckon on a recurrence of the abnormal circumstances prevailing in England at the present time. (I)) If we can be guaranteed reinforcements required we will be prepared to consider question of maintaining nucleus of cadres efficient to develop force required for advance on Kabul and Kandahar within time stated, provided that this will not entail an aggregate military expenditure in excess of limit indicated in para. 14 of our Despatch No. I, Special. We will let you know in due course whether this condition can be fulfilled.Letter No. M. 26910/19 of the 30th August 1919 from India Office to War Office. Sir.In reply to your letter1 of the 1st July, No. 0104/4262 (M.O. 3), and in. ,T * , i        .        ,fliri   continuation- of my letter dated 6th August,1 No..1136a,&apos;dated 21st August 1919   x.   ,f .-,f.)OA T     &apos;   r    ,  i .    P        -,    &amp;    &apos;from the Government of India. N?- M- -0io9&apos; 1 am Erected to forward a Copyof the reply received from the Government of India to the enquiry contained in your letter quoted above.The question of the strength and equipment of the Army which it is necessary for the Government of India to maintain for the defence of India will doubtless receive further close examination, both from the Military advisers of His Majesty&apos;s Government and from the Committee presided over by Lord Esheiyand Mr. Montagu does not propose to comment upon it at present. But inasmuch as it has now come under consideration as part of a wider question,-viz., that of the maintenance in India of troops for other than Indian purposes, he thinks it fair to inform the Army Council that, as at present advised, he cannot contemplate the imposition on Indian revenues of any charge in excess of that necessary for the maintenance of an army for the local defence of India and for that purpose only.Extract from Despatch No. 72 of 20th November 1919, from the Secretary of State forIndia to the Government of India.My Lord,I also request that Your Excellences Government will consider and let-me have your views on the question whether further economy in British personnel cannot be secured by an extended use of modern contrivances, and by the reduction to a minimum of garrisons destined to a sedentary role.&amp; 6 * &amp;Letter No. 0164/4262 (M.O. 2) of the 18th February 1920 from war Office to India Office.Sir,I am commanded by the Army Council to refer to para. 8 of Despatch No. I, special, dated 22nd March from the Government of India, and particularly to the words &quot; maintain an army sufficient to ... . undertake if necessary punitive operations against Afghanistan.&quot;The Council would like to be informed as to the extent of the &quot; punitive opera-tions&quot; contemplated, in arriving at the estimate of the force required for lndia-s defence as given in para. 7 of the Despatch.2. If, as the Council imagine, India merely contemplated (a) The occupation of Jalalabad.(b) A limited offensive from Quetta.(c) The defence of her North-West Frontier from the Swat to the Zhob.The Council wish to point out that these measures alone offer no certainty of ensuring the defence of India in the event of a hostile Afghanistan.3. The Secretary of State is aware that in the recent operations the Government of India did not consider that the occupation of Jalalabad would necessarily end the Avar, and that they foresaw the possibility of having to occupy Kabul in order to obtain the submission of Afghanistan.3009-2 A 2
4. The Council therefore most strongly urge that il&apos; the Government of India in. estimating their requirements have merely considered the limited offensive of an advance to Jalalabad, they should be asked to reconsider their decision and resubmit the estimate of the field army that they will require for an advance on Kabul and Kandahar, for the defence of India cannot in the opinion of the Army Council be considered to lie effectively secured by preparations which do not provide for the occupation of these two places.Extract from Telegram No 788 of 1st March 1020 from Secretary of State for Indiato Viceroy, Army Department.. . . . War Office had expressed opinion that defence of India cannot be effectively secured by preparations which do not provide for occupation of Kabul and Kandahar. They ask that you should reconsider field army recommended in your Despatch No. 1, Special of 22nd March accordingly.I suggest Esher Committee should be informed of this when considering limits of scope of army for which India is to be responsible, and I should be glad to have your own views.Extract from Telegram No. 3707 of VMh March 1920 from Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India.3707. . . . Unless and until the British units allotted for the garrison of India, have been brought up to the establishment; our artillery has been fully equipped ; the Signal personnel demanded has reached India ; our complement of machine-gun units has arrived ; our administrative services have been completed in British personnel; our Mechanical Transport is in an efficient state both in regard to personnel, vehicles, and workshops, and all units have had time to become acclimatised and trained, we do not consider we should be justified in undertaking operations involving an advance to Kabul, and in any case we should be averse to undertaking these operations before the autumn at the earliest.2. Moreover we should find the greatest difficulty in obtaining sufficient animal transport for such an operation from existing resources, and would probably have to purchase from outside India.3. To permit of such an advance we calculate we shall require following units and formations additional to all units already despatched or under orders to embark from England this trooping season :  (A) R.A.F. four squadrons, namely, one Scout, two Corps reconnaissance, one bombing.(B) Two complete Infantry Divisions. We might be able to provide Indian Infantry for these Divisions if the situation in Waziristan has stabilised, and if the forces overseas are reduced to permanent post-war basis.At present we could not find the requisite battalions.(C) Army and Lines of Communication troops : one Corps Signal Company, two-Motor Air-line Sections, three Cable Sections, two Cavalry Brigade Signal Troops, seven R.F.A. Brigade Signal Sections.Medical: one Casualty Clearing Station and one Sanitary Section for each Division.Four Mobile Laboratories, namely, two Bacteriological and Hygiene, with technical personnel.General hospitals complete on scale to provide accommodation at 10 per cent, of total strength of formations and units being sent, out.Officer personnel of Medical establishments should include Surgical, Bacterio-logical, Ophthalmic, Sanitary and X-Ray specialists, with reserves of same.Transport: 42 Mechanical Transport Companies with 3-ton lorries, and due proportion of workshops.   Nine Motor Ambulance Convoys.4. For a simultaneous advance to Kandahar we should require, in addition to troops mentioned in para. 3, R.A.F. one bombing squadron, two British Cavalry Regiments, one R.FI.A. Battery and Ammunition Column, two Machine Gun Squadrons, and two Cavalry Brigade Signal Troops for additional Cavalry Brigades to be formed in India, one complete British Infantry Division, with the same proviso about Indian Infantry as in para. 3.
5. Above all, we require skilled tradesmen J&apos;or signal service, such as telegraph and wireless operators, wireless litters, ami motor cyclists and artificers lor mechanical transport service, as none of these classes are obtainable in India.(). In view of present backward slate of our communications, and having regard to increased, maintenance of modern armies, advance to Kabul would have to be undertaken in two phases: first, which would include a limited advance into hostile territory with a view of separating Afghans from our tribesmen and consolidation of communications, including construction of railways; length of time required for this operation is difficult; to estimate, but we anticipate having to construct railway in Khyber, and to improve railway facilities in Baluchistan.7. Tlx1 above representation of our requirements in the contingency ([noted by the War Office can only be taken as a partial enumeration of what we should need. We have not pointed out the large number of additional officers which would be wanted for a variety of purposes, the stock of our resources in engineer stores, mechanical transport, medical and other war equipment, &amp;c. Moreover, other points must be considered, namely : (a) The bulk of British officers are sadly in need of rest and change. Their juniors are inexperienced, unfamiliar with Indian conditions and ignorant of language, (b) The rank and file of the Indian Army similarly require furlough and rest. Discharges on a very large scale will be claimed on official termination of war, and recruits to replace them will be difficult to get and will take time to train, (c) Recruitment prospects, in respect of which it is practically certain that we should have to offer a very large bonus to secure numbers we should want, having in view the general prosperity of agricultural classes, condition of war weariness prevailing, and possible lukewarinness of Mohammedans owing to Khalifat question,Nepal insists on reduced Gurkha recruitment, and we now no longer enlist trans-frontier Pathans.8. These facts should serve to demonstrate that the present is not a propitious time for embarking on a forward military policy as advocated by War Office, and we are disposed to think that the latter were not wholly familiar with present Indian conditions when they formulated, the policy put forward in para. (5 (a) quoted in their telegram dated 28th January.Although, therefore, we have given some indication of our military requirements in accordance with directions in above-quoted War Office telegram, we desire to add that for the military reasons given in this telegram and on consideration of general policy and finance, we cannot contemplate an advance on Kabul except in the case of -definite Afghan&apos;aggression on India, and in these circumstances we should propose to operate at our own. convenience and at our own time.Telegram from Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,dated 3rd September 1920.11581. 3rd September. Recent demands received by us for reinforcements for Mesopotamia on a large scale have forced us to consider whole question regarding supply of overseas garrisons from Indian Army.It would appear that His Majesty&apos;s Government is counting on India to provide a cpiota of the permanent garrisons of the mandatory territories in addition to certain colonial garrisons, including Aden, the Gulf ports and consular escorts in East Persia. We have received no direct intimation that IIis Majesty&apos;s Government desires us to undertake this liability ; but have received an estimate which shows that, on present figures, this force will include, among other details, four cavalry regiments, one -cavalry troop, 10 Sappers and Miners companies, 39h Infantry and. Pioneer battalions, one Signal troop and four Signal companies. It is possible this estimate is not final. We invite attention to the fact that we have not been consulted as to probable political effect in India of accepting an engagement of this magnitude. It appears :advisable to us, however, to warn you at once of our views on this aspect of the question.We have evidence to show that the great bulk of. educated opinion in India is opposed to our undertaking extensive obligations in regard to overseas garrisons, and the subject has already attracted considerable attention in the Press and on the platform. The Turkish Peace Terms are universally unpopular, not only among Mohamedans, but among Hindus. Further, moderate opinion, including many Europeans, considers India is being exploited in being asked to provide for service outside India an unreasonably large proportion of troops now employed for Imperial
purposes, since it is clear that no similar demand has been made on the Dominions,., and that all British troops were demobilised as quickly as possible, with the inevitable result that, in case of trouble, the increased demands must be met from India and not. from home.Attention is drawn to the fact that India is an original member of the League of Nations, but it is Great Britain and not India which has received a mandate for the new territories, and the troops employed are largely Indian. The general feeling above referred to naturally reinforces the movement among advanced Mohamedans on grounds peculiar to themselves against the despatch of troops to Mesopotamia and Palestine, while it is of course seized upon by extremist agitators, who are glad of any opportunity to embarrass us. We apprehend that this will react seriously on the general political situation, and effect morale of the army, and we do not think it will be possible to maintain position that India is to provide troops from the Indian Army for this purpose for any length of time. Again, it is difficult to convince India at large that charges for such troops are not borne by Indian revenues, and this adds to our difficulties in gaining acceptance for greatly increased charges for military expenditure which forms part of our recent budget arrangements. Nor, indeed, are we ourselves able to contest the argument that obligation for maintaining overseas troops leads to considerable additional expenditure, since, apart from temporary difficulties as to demobilisation caused by knowledge that additional demands may be made on us at any moment, it is obvious not only that there are many items which we cannot definitely allocate, such as increased staff and inspection of (corrupt. group) and accommodation, but the knowledge that considerable portion of the Indian Army may be called upon to spend long periods on overseas service will affect general rates of pay at which we can recruit the Indian Army.We do not wish to represent that we have so far encountered any difficulty as regards reinforcements recently despatched to Mesopotamia, though we are aware that many regiments which have been serving overseas are feeling the strain due to lack of furlough, and the dangers of political and religious influence affecting the army are considerable. Our main apprehensions are, however, for the future, and we look with grave concern on what we hold to be the inevitable consequences, political and otherwise (corrupt group), which will commit ourselves to supply overseas garrisons for a prolonged period.It must be realised that there are certain inherited traditions connected with peace service in the Indian Army which have become to be regarded as a right, such as the grant of liberal leave and furlough for harvesting, for the purposes of marriage, or for other domestic reasons. Such considerations are incompatible with prolonged service overseas.Again, although the men themselves may raise no objection to overseas service, the women-folk are put to great inconvenience and frequently to hardship, through the absence of their men-kind, and consequently growing discontented, a state of things of which the agitator is not slow to take advantage, but one which we are practically powerless to remedy, and we trust you will impress on Cabinet Council the importance of recognising these factors.In our special Despatch No. 2, we stated definitely that Government of India could not accept an obligation to supply permanent overseas garrisons to mandatory territories, and we now desire definitely to emphasise that position, and ask that His Majesty&apos;s Government should take our views on the subject into consideration. His Majesty&apos;s Government can rely on our doing our best to endeavour to enlist men in India on their behalf for local forces maintained in Mesopotamia or elsewhere, but we do not consider the Indian Army should be required to provide large overseas forces, and we shall be glad to receive some definite statement of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in this matter.In the present condition of affairs, particularly in Mesopotamia, we shall, of course, make every effort to do our best to meet emergent demands for reinforcements as they arise, though we recognise the danger of this course, but we look to His Majesty&apos;s Government to return Indian units to us as speedily as the situation permits. As regards reinforcements now being sent, we propose, with your concurrence, to make a public announcement that, owing to the spread of serious disorder in Mesopo-tamia, Government have been compelled to declare that a state of war exists in that area, and intends to use all resources at its disposal to put an end to this state, and to protect British and Indian subjects on service in tho country. This will constitute service in Mesopotamia as active, and give us the requisite power to deal with any inconvenient incidents which arise.
