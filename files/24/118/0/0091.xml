SITUATION IF IRELAND ?0R THE ?!EEK ENDING22nd JANUARY, 1921.(Circulate! to trip Cabinet by thot S,of g.t for War) 1* GEKPRA.L SITUATION;The increased activity of the Irish Republican Army reported last week has been continued and has been intensified particularly in the Martial Law Area and in Dublin.   In the 6th Division Area % numerous attacks have been made on police Barracks, all of which have been completely unsuccessful and several ambushes have been attempted, of which only four havo been in any degree successful from the rebel point of view.Hostility has again been mainly directed against the police but there has been an increase in the number of attacks on the Military forces. *in ;ci?blin hardly a day has passed without an attempt to attack some party of either troops or police *   Details of these attacks are given in para. 2, of this report. *As an offset to this hostile activity and in confirmation of the view expressed last week that, from the Military point of view, the situation is becoming: more   favourable, the Crown forces have achieved some considerable successes, and of 19 attacks, cn police barraoks not one has been successful and no casualties have been suffered by the defenders.Several ambushes have been surprised ana some of those concerned have been captured, in some cases fully armed.In County Cork searches have again resulted in the dis-cevery of dumps of arms, ammunition    and equipment.in Dublin repeated attacks by bomb and revolver fire have resulted in practically no casualties to the Crown forces, while-there is no doubt that considerable losses have been inflicted on the rebels, in one case a woman who was seen to be firing at a military lorry with a revolver was wounded.The increased activity on the part of the rebels and the not yet apparent inclination on the part of the so-called well&quot; disposed portion   of the population to assist in the restoration cf law and order, makes it appear evident that before long further steps will be inevitable to safeguard the lives of the Crown forces.   Already the G.O.C. 6th Division has found it necessary to apply further punitive measures in Cork and at other places where ambushes have taken place.   The curfew in Cork city is now operative on Saturdays and Sundays from 1700 lira, tc 0300 hrsThe question of the extension of Martial Law to Dublin City and County has been carefully considered and may at a very early date become necessary in order to prevent the constant attacks which are now occurring on the troops and police.1 have requested the chief seoretary to let me have his vievs on this question as&apos; I consider it essential that as soon as I think it necessary that Martial i,av; should be imposed, it should be done without any delay.   A warning notice has been .published that if attacks on Metor vehicles continue prominent members of the I.R.A. will be carried in each vehicle conveying such Crown Forces as a hostage.
It is intended to try for high treason fivo men recently captured while actually engaged in an ambush end with arms In thoir possession.     It is hoped that if a conviction is obtained this may havo a deterrent effect on the activities of the Irish Republican Amy.As a result of outrages in previous weeks, curfow orders have also boon issued in Counties Longford and Rja common, and fairs and markets have boon prohibited in two villages in the latter County.&apos;?u operations.Dublin 16th r 17th January^    On the ,night of January 15/16 an area&quot;bounded byInTTMvcr Liffey on the South, by Worth King Stroct on the North, and by Capcl.Street and Church Street on the East and V/ost (an area about 1,000* by 800x) was surrounded by a Pardon of troops and isolated.    Barbed wire entanglements wore erected at all the approaches and   all ingress and ogress wore prevented.On tho morning, of Sunday January 16th.;. a systematic search was commenced from the North side of.tho area by fresh troops, behind whom, as they progressed In bounds, the cordon troops took up now positions, gradually reducing the isolated area.Tho search was discontinued at dusk on January 16th. and resumed on the following morsdng.    Arrangements were mado fcr passing workoro. out of tho area and they wcro provided with passes for re-admission.During tho afternoon the search was completed and the troops were withdrawn.Although the main object of the search (tho capture of some of the extremist loaders) was not achieved, one important arrest Was effected, and experience was gained which will be valuable in case a similar operation should bo again under-taken.    The lessons to be learnt have been discussed at Brigade Conferences.CLEAR ISLAND?
