This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s GovernmentSECRET.CP. 2411.1 oTHE CABINET.THE GOVERNMENT FACTORIES AT WALTHAM ABBEY AND GRETNA, THE EXPLOSIVES TRADE AND THE ARMY CORDITE POSITION.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.When by the Cabinet decision of 23rd March, 1920 (Cabinet 16 (20) (1)) the     70 responsibility for the administration of Government Factories for the manufacture of Gen. No. munitions was transferred from the Ministry of Munitions to the War Office, 1 :  4722 instituted a searching investigation into the needs of the Army in the light of the experience of the war with due regard to the accumulated reserves at present in our possession.The case of the smaller factories did not present many difficulties and most of these are in course of being &quot;thrown up&quot; for disposal where it is not clearly in the national interest that they should be retained.The question of the supply of cordite for the land forces is a problem of considerable complexity and I asked a Committee of the Army Council composed of the Surveyor-General of Supply, the Finance Member, the Quartermaster-General, the Master-General of the Ordnance, the Secretary and the Secretary for Finance to explore the position.The basis of their calculations was the maintenance of a force of 20 divisions, as this estimate of requirements, was accepted by the Finance Committee (8th October, 1919) as the governing factor in determining the reserves of stores to be retained.I circulate herewith a copy of the Council Committees report, the conclusions of which I endorse, and would ask for an early discussion by my colleagues.The question of the supply of cordite for naval services has been raised by the First Lord of the Admiralty in his memorandum of 7th November, 1920 (F.C. 51), with which was circulated a copy of the Moulton Committee&apos;s report.w. s. c.5th January, 1921.(1321/49)   100   1/21   HAS, Ltd  8854wo
THE GOVERNMENT FACTORIES AT WALTHAM ABBEY AND GRETNA, THE EXPLOSIVES TRADE AND THE ARMY CORDITE POSITION.REPORT BY THE COMMITTEE OF THE ARMY COUNCIL ON THEFUTURE OF NATIONAL FACTORIES.The Committee of the Army Council have considered the reports of two Committees one, under the chairmanship of  Sir Edward Pearson, on the future of Gretna and Waltham Abbey, and a later Committee, under the chairmanship of Lord Moulton, on cordite generally and the position of the trade, as explained by the Explosives Trade Company, Ltd. They have also examined experts on cordite, whilst the Surveyor-General of Supply has interviewed representatives of the trade. Various estimates of the relative cost of maintaining Gretna and Waltham and of producing cordite have also been investigated.The present position of the cordite factories, so far as the War Office is concerned, was summarized by the Surveyor-General of Supply as follows :-Two cordite factories were handed over by the Ministry of Munitions on 1st June, last, viz., Gretna and Waltham Abbey, representing a capacity of 650 and 250 tons of cordite a week, respectively, at the end of 12 months. The expenditure at present being incurred on these factories is at the rate of approximately 400,000/. per annum. Although a certain proportion of this expenditure is recoverable in respect of wagon repair work at Gretna and the handling of surplus stores, the greater proportion is a dead weight charge. Duplicate staffs are at present being maintained at these two factories.The Master-General of the Ordnance explained to the Committee that in order to replenish the present reserve stock of cordite (viz., about 9,000 tons) in about 12 years,* the peace time requirements of Army cordite will be 15 tons a week for the next 5 years, rising then to 40 tons, and after a further 7 years to 75 tons a week. The Master-General of the Ordnance also indicated that the requirements of the General Staff for operations involving 12 divisions would be 143 tons a week, and for operations involving 20 divisions 700 tons, rising to 1,000 tons a week at the end of a year.The Pearson and Moulton Committees both favoured and recommended the retention of Gretna and the disposal of Waltham Abbey. This conclusion, however, requires to be reviewed in the light of estimates prepared for the Committee, showing that on a pure maintenance basis it would cost less to retain Waltham than Gretna and that, even on a productive basis, Gretna would be only slightly cheaper than Waltham. Further, these two Committees did not take into consideration the labour problems involved in closing down an old established factory like Waltham, nor the difficulty of transferring pre-war workers and their families to Gretna.As regards the Trade, their position is that, whereas trade capacity before the war was 125 tons a week, towards the employment of which Government orders were received each year, they now have a capacity amounting to at least 350 tons a week which is idle as the plant cannot be utilized for the manufacture of commercial explosives. The Trade is, therefore, faced with the maintenance for ,an indefinite period of idle cordite plant bringing in no revenue, and with no prospect of Government orders for some years.Importance is also attached by the Master-General of the Ordnance to the retention of capacity for rifle N.C.T. powder, this being now considered a better propellant than cordite for rifles and machine guns. There exists at Irvine plant suitable for this purpose which could be moved to Gretna without much expense.In reviewing possible solutions of the problem presented to them, the Committee had to reject any idea of a return to pre-war conditions. Actual orders during the next few years will be so small that it is not a practical proposition to revert during that period to the pre-war practice of dividing the orders between a Government factory and the Trade.    The experience of the war demonstrated the importance of a large* The estimated life of cordite at home is 15 years; the bulk of existing stocks is not less than 3 years old.  The life of cordite abroad varies from G to 10 years according to the climate.(8834)
2output of cordite, and the Master-General of the Ordnance, after full discussion with the General Staff, stated definitely that it was essential that capacity should be retained which would be capable of producing a minimum of at least 100 tons a week in three months rising to 1,000 tons a week in one year. These figures are calculated on the requirements of a force of 20 divisions, which is the approved basis governing the policy for the retention of stores, vide War Cabinet (Finance Committee) paper, &quot;Surplus Stores,&quot; of 25th September, 1919 (F.C. 4),* and-Cabinet (Finance Com-mittee) paper, &quot;Stores Surplus to Army Requirements,&quot; of 1st December, 1920 (CP. 2208). The Committee have accepted this statement of requirements, and have endeavoured to ascertain the most economical means of maintaining such capacity in this country as a reserve for war. It should also be realized that cordite is not of commercial value, and that special capacity, for its production must therefore, be reserved. Further, it appears unwise, for reasons of safety, that reliance should be placed wholly on one factory.The following are the proposals considered by the Committee : (1.) The Government to retain Waltham Abbey and Gretna, and leave it entirely to the Trade to decide whether to maintain any trade capacity without Government orders or assistance.   (Capacity, 900 tons.)This would involve the entire exclusion of the Explosives Trade with the loss of its manufacturing experience and technical research work; moreover the minimum requirements of the Army, as outlined above, might not be fully met.(2.) The Government to retain Gretna for experimental work and peace production, close down and dispose of Waltham Abbey, arid enter into an arrange-ment with the Trade for maintaining a certain trade capacity to be available in an emergency.   (Capacity, 1,000 tons.)This would give an adequate output, but would involve considerable expense in the retention by the Government of Gretna, and a difficulty in limiting expenditure there. Labour problems would also arise in connection with closing down an old establishment like Waltham Abbey in the neighbourhood of London with the attendant difficulty of transferring workers and their families to Gretna, and the cost of moving the manufacture of gunpowder elsewhere.(3.) The Government to retain Waltham Abbey for experimental and peace production, close down and dispose of Gretna, and enter into an arrange-ment with the Trade for maintaining a certain trade capacity to be available in an emergency.   (Capacity, 600 tons.)This could not provide the minimum requirements and would involve the enormous dead loss of scrapping Gretna, the disposal value of which would be relatively small.(4.) The Government to retain Waltham Abbey for experimental and peace production, and enter into an arrangement with the Trade for maintaining Gretna at a fixed charge and a certain trade capacity to be available when called upon.   (Capacity, 1,250 tons.)This involves the retention of three separate sources of supply for Army cordite, and the insurance is possibly in excess of the requirements as stated above.So far as the exigencies of the future military situation can be foreseen, Proposal (2) would, in the judgment of the Committee, satisfy the needs of the army. If, however, the Government are averse from the abandonment of Waltham Abbey, and do not wish at this stage to be committed to the permanent retention of Gretna as a cordite factory, the Committee favour Proposal (4) for the following reasons : -It provides for the continuous maintenance of Waltham Abbey, with an establish ment of pre-war workers, for experimental work and for meeting peace time requirements for Army cordite and gunpowder; it offers a prospect of Gretna being maintained by the Trade for a fixed annual sum for three years more economically than the Govern-ment could maintain it; it ensures the co-operation of the Trade ; whilst it is also a flexible policy, in that it can be reviewed and modified in three years&apos; time in the light of then existing circumstances.* On 8th October, 1919, the Finance Committee accepted Table B in this paper as the principle which should govern the policy of the War Office.
The Committee, therefore, examined this alternative from the point of view 01 ascertaining what financial liabilities would be involved, with the following result: Waliham Abbey: 20,000/. per annum would cover the expense of maintaining Waltham in a state capable of rapid expansion up to 250 tons a week, over and above the expenditure necessary for making our small peace requirements of 15 tons or more a week.Gretna : For 60,000/. per annum the Explosives Trade, Ltd., are prepared to maintain Gretna in a state capable of producing 650 tons a week, 10 months&apos; after starting operations. Their offer would cover maintenance, including resident superintendence, wages, materials, power and light, policing, &amp;c, but not rent, rates, taxes, insurance, force majeure, the township, running costs of services such as water, or for performing any work (such as handling stores) for the Government.Explosives Trade : 57,500/. per annum is asked for by the Explosives Trade, Ltd., as a subsidy to enable them to maintain a weekly capacity of 350 tons of cordite, and is an estimate of cost of keeping in being the idle portion of their Ardeer plant. It assumes no orders for Cordite are given. If orders for 20 tons a week are given, the Government is to pay 20,000/. per annum plus actual manufacturing costs.The cost of this insurance scheme is approximately 137,500/. per annum, and it provides for the retention of a weekly capacity of about 1,250 tons. It must, however, be considered as a whole, since the Trade propositions as regards maintaining Gretna and Trade capacity are inter-dependent.This sum of 137,500/. applied to Proposal (2) would leave 80,000/. available for the cost of maintaining Gretna in Government hands. The Committee feel sure that no reduction can be made in this figure, and in all probability it would be considerably exceeded. Thus Proposal (2) would cost as much as, if not more than, Proposal (4) and has all the disadvantages attendant on the closing of Waltham Abbey. It should be noted that in the foregoing figures the Committee have included nothing for depreciation of plant and buildings at Gretna. The capital value still stands in the books at about 5 millions, though this sum is far in excess of its realizable value.It may be observed that the adoption of Proposal (4) does not preclude the adoption of Proposal (2) at a later date. In effect, Proposal (4) is a recognition of the fact that the present situation is too obscure to admit of the adoption of a permanent policy and that for a period of three years a safe policy should be adopted tentatively and then reviewed in the light of the circumstances of the time.The Committee, in putting forward the two following alternative solutions : (2.) The Government to retain Gretna for experimental work and peace production and close down and dispose of Waltham Abbey and enter into an arrangement with the Trade for maintaining a certain trade capacity to be available in an emergency ;or(4.) The Government to retain Waltham Abbey for experimental work and peace production and enter into an arrangement with the Trade for maintaining Gretna and a certain trade capacity to be available when called upon ;recommend the adoption of Proposal (4).        *J.
