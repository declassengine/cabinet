3jesty*s Government)SECRET. ............................&apos;Section J.   Following is weekly telegram.   Provincial reports : Madras. Lull in political agitation as results of elections announced. Some further attempts made to organise Madras students into boycotting colleges, but beyond one demonstration of about 1,500 students, who marched through Madras, led by Muslim volunteers, there has been little to remark upon. In Guiitur district non-co-operators had some success with two newly constituted municipalities; councillors have resigned and municipal administration at standstill. Deadlock at Buckingham Mills continues, and non-official committee of six persons appointed to make an enquiry into and report on. occurrences of 9th December, already reported to you. At non-Brahmin Federation, Madras, President Iranian Pillay extended hearty welcome to H.R.H. Duke of Connaught, and vigorously attacked non-co-operation movement, pointing out its potentialities of danger and difficulty of control as evidenced by Saty Agraha movement in 1919. Asserted saner elements of country had altogether dissociated themselves from it.Section 2. Bombay. Ohotani, President of Central Khilafat Committee, has addressed manifesto to Congress and Moslem League leaders, urging necessity of these two bodies ceasing to be merely deliberative, and of forming themselves into executive organisations. Ostensible reason to set up some fully developed organisa-tion &quot; to take place of barriers they are breaking down daily,&quot; but in reality to meet demands upon Central Khilafat Committee from students, schools, pleaders, &amp;c, that have joined non-co-operation movement. Chotani suggests that Congress and Moslem League appoint Standing Committees with sub-committees or boards: (Ij for finances to raise national loan; (2) for national education, avIio should get 50 per cent, of loan ; (3) for national industries and commerce, with bank and information bureau ; and (4) for national propaganda.Section 3. Pir Bakaclar Shah has made declaration complete loyalty to Govern-ment. lie is the leading Pir of Matiari, a non-co-operation stronghold in Sincl, and his action is calculated to have very good effect. Government of India despatch on position of Indians in East Africa on the whole well received.Bengal. Lull in political activity. Bengal Khilafat Committee sanctioned Rs. 6,COO for special train to convey delegates to Nagpur Congress. Gandhi contem-plates tour this month with Ali brothers, and has stated will remain in Eastern Bengal for three months. His speeches at Dacca do not appear to have produced any great result. Abdulla Hafiz, Secretary, Dacca Khilafat committee, being prosecuted under section 171 (F) of Indian Penal Code for statement contained in leaflet &quot;that anyone who would try to become a member of Council or would vote, would be Bedin (irreligious) and would thereby sever connection with Islam.&quot;Section 4. C. R. Das openly asserts that he intends to make greatest possible capital out of case, as section 171 (F) not intended to cover cases of this nature. If convicted, he would inflame all Mohamedans by proclaiming that Government of India has purposely passed a law interfering with religion ; while, if Government lost case, lie would similarly announce that Government officials have purposely against the law tried to interfere with their religion.Section 5. Remaining State prisoners released on 3rd January on introduction reforms, and well received in Press.Section 0. Bihar and Orissa. Lull in non-co-operation movement. Every reason to expect that few students will ultimately cut their connection with recognised educational institutions, and those likely to do so are not students whom heads of colleges will be sorry to lose. Widespread discontent amongst police, due to economic and not political causes. Question of further revising pay under consideration, and will be sanctioned by telegram.Section 7.   Swami Biswanand has stirred up considerable excitement in Adra amongst railway menial staff, and on 31st December some 1,000 to 1,800 menial staff went on strike, including a number of private servants of Europeans.    Deputy 3193     100 1.21
Commissioner interviewed strikers and succeeded in inducing them to work, hut on 3rd Swami returned and Deputy Commissioner issued order under section 1-14, Criminal Procedure Code, to all railway menials to abstain from attending meeting. Order under section J 14 was later also served on Swami, directing him to refrain from making speeches calculated to promote feelings of enmity and hatred between classes. His main object is to prevent cow-killing by any means in his power, and speeches on 30th not only inflamed minds of menials and subordinate servants, but also resulted in strong feeling against European and Anglo-Indian subordinates, most of whom were boycotted by their sweepers and servants for three days, and. were unable to get meat or supplies from the bazaar ; with difficulty were prevented from going down to the bazaar to bring back their servants by force.Section 8. Swami&apos;s present attitude on cow-killing new departure, calculated to bring about strike and boycott at any time. Obviously aimed at Europeans. Order under section 1 1-1 has been approved, and Deputy Commissioner instructed to prosecute him at once if he disobeys order. Swami&apos;s movements closely watched and accurate report taken of his speeches. As soon as satisfactory evidence available, sanction to prosecute under section 124a or 153a of Indian Penal Code will be applied for, or alternative action under section 108, Code of Criminal Procedure.Burma, Boycott of colleges and schools continues. Boycott approved by Director of Young Men&apos;s Buddhist Association, who proposes converting all Young Men&apos;s Buddhist Association Schools into National Schools. Six or seven lakhs of rupees have been promised in support of movement. Capture of association by extremists facilitated, by Wedgwood&apos;s denunciation of Burma Government. Prosecu-tion of Rangoon, Mail under section 153a resulted in sentence of four months&apos; simple imprisoment for editor and two months&apos; for printer.United Provinces. We have reported separately outbreaks in Rai Bareilly.Central Provinces.-Following is brief appreciation of Congress from Central Provinces. Outstanding feature personal domination of Gandhi over all political leaders and followers. Opposition to his view overcome without difficulty, owing to his strong hold over the bulk of the delegates and visitors. Direct opponents of non-co-operation silenced without difficulty. Moderates of Nagpur not heard, extremist opponents under Khaparde and Dr. Munje brushed aside, Pandit Mad an Mohan Malaviya&apos;s effort was nugatory, Jinnah carried no influence, Lajpat Rai wobbled and then became silent. Their view appears to be that it was hopeless to attempt any real opposition in temper of the meeting, and they must wait. Gandhi&apos;s power also shown in change of presidential address. Address modified in several important points in which President had in previously printed copies opposed, many of the items of non-co-operators&apos; programme. In the Subjects Committee there was a long debate over the change in the Congress creed. The more violent proposals in favour of complete independence, and a republic, were defeated in spite of efforts of the Ali brothers, and Gandhi carried his formula by an overwhelming majority, opposition of Jinnah, Das, Pal and Malaviya in favour of (? retention in) resolution on creed of British connection being overruled. Wedgwood and Spoor did their best, but also failed. Very little hope of even any important split in Congress party or any open secession of the opponents of Gandhi&apos;s policy, who, it is said, will retire to their tents, and will not form a separate party and lead a counter propaganda against his policy. Gandhi said to be well satisfied with progress made in non-co-operation campaign, in spite of small response hitherto made in regard to specific items of programme. Regards past few months as preliminary period for preparation of ground. If response from educated classes not been much, masses have been largely influenced in principle. Period of intensive campaign will follow, both amongst masses and educated classes, committees of propaganda being organised in all districts, towns and Tahsils, and emissaries also being despatched from outside. Of other conferences at Nagpur, those of depressed classes and native states of some interest; at former the leading Mahar explained that his community opposed non-co-operation, but would accept it if Gandhi could induce the castes to remove the ban on untouchables. Gandhi suggested non-co-operation of the Mahars with higher castes until they were admitted to equality. At latter conference, attended mainly by a few hundred delegates from petty Rajpntana States, lurid pictures were painted of tyranny prevailing in Native States and calling for radical reforms.General. Leaders are now considering how and when effect should, he given to non-co-operation programme adopted at Nagpur. Gandhi desired to fix 1st February, Lajpat Rai 16th, C. R. Das in favour of postponing the matter till end of March.   Das
reported to have said that chief stumbling block in carrying out non-co-operation programme would be zamindars. Gandhi considered that these would be brought to their senses if tenants were induced not to pay rents. It is also reported that at secret conference at Nagpur, Gandhi opposed resort to violence, which was favoured by Hasrat Mohani and Swami Sraddhanand, on ground that till India united, this would only result in giving Government opportunity of repression. We are carefully considering whole situation in light of proceedings at Nagpur and other information. Indications seem to be that failure of attack ou educational institutes and attempts to induce lawyers to suspend practice is recognised, and that efforts of non-co-operators will now be directed towards organisation of propaganda among masses, more particularly tenantry and labour. Developments in this direction will require and receive close watching, and more frequent resort to action under ordinary law may be necessary. At present, we are not inclined to think any fundamental change in policy will be necessary, but propose to consult Local Governments, and must, of course, be largely guided by course of events.Section 9. Welcome extended at Madras to Duke of Comiaught, royal one in its warmth ; enormous crowds present, and not a single untoward incident. Appointment of Lord Reading very well received except in one or two of the most extreme papers.
