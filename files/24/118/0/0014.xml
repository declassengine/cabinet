This Document is the Pioperty of&apos;JK.a-BrM.a_f,        jeal/s GovernmenLru; T i Qlj^aited by the Secretary of State for India.SECRET.I circulate a telegram from Sir P. Cox on the question of railway policy in Mesopotamia, and would invite attention to the last part dealing with the financial3rd January .1921.Telegram -from Sir P. Cox, Baghdad, to Secretary of State for India,dated 17th December .1920.(R.)  85 S.   My telegram No. 13255 of 1st November.Lapse of a month has made urgency of issue more acute, and at present, conditions imperatively demand decision without delay in regard to question of&apos; railway policy, and finance and recruitment of labour in connection therewith. In hope that it may assist towards an early decision. I beg to submit concrete suggestions.In a recent communication, General Officer Coinmanding-in-Chief intimated that, from point of view of military necessity, he would not require section of Baghdad-Basrah line between Jarbuyieh (near Hillah) and Rumaitha, and did not propose to re-establish it. On the other hand, I cannot help thinking that, having regard to situation described in his telegram X. 707, 27th November to War Office, re-establishment of this alternative through line of communication with Basrah is essential in the military interests of the immediate future. Apart from that His Majesty&apos;s Government were of opinion Trooper&apos;s telegram 73864 M.O. 2, dated 13th January 19.19 that maintenance of Baghdad-Basrah line by Euphrates must be a cardinal factor of British policy in Meso-potamia. From point of view of this administration the Basrah-Baghdad-Khanikin Railway must, in my opinion, be backbone of further development, and I would make it clear that, whereas, independent sections of this line cannot be made to pay commercially, expert opinion indicates that, as a complete through line, it is a sound project, and provided that its safety can be maintained by national administration, without employment of British troops, it can be made to pay. Local Government are confident that, if line is restored, they will be able, by giving an interest in some form to tribes along route, to (? ensure) safety of system. I therefore strongly recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Government decide definitely in principle that Baghdacl-Basrah-Khanikin line is to be re-established.Secondly, I propose that a branch line to Iverbela (? should be) part of our programme if, as is believed, local capital can be enlisted for its construction.Thirdly, that extension to Mosul should be contemplated via Kirkuk.Fourthly, Kut-Baghdad, Shergat-Mosul, Baghdad-Falluja lines are not required by Mesopotainian Government, and can only be run at a loss. If needed by Army of Occupation on military grounds, they should be administered by Mesopotaniian Railways Organisation, and both capital expenditure and any loss on working&apos; should be a charge on His Majesty&apos;s Government, Thus, if proposal made in General, (? Baghdad), telegram X. 7(? 32), dated 27th November, for extension from Shergat to Mosul, is sanctioned, it should be treated on above basis, both for construction and running, but I would observe that construction of this line would place heavy strain on present railway establishment, both as regards labour and material. If, however, it is strategically necessary, it must of course have priority.In this connection, I have no precise information of position of Baghdad-Samarra section, as between ourselves and late Ottoman Baghdad Railway Company. It is clear that our railway policy in future will be vitally affected by our arrangements with Government of India (? in regard to) recruitment of labour. The latter have intimated that, in principle, they will not permit recruitment of Indian labour for Mesopotamia, unless all restrictions on Indian immigration are withdrawn. As far as skilled labour is concerned, we shall be unable to dispense with it for many years.. As regards unskilled labour, the position is somewhat different. Before the recent disturoances commenced it was being gradually replaced by local labour, and unless large works are in progress, and so long as work can be carried on at a normal pace, as apart from pressing military urgency, it could in time be practically all replaced by local labour as this element become(? s omitted) gradually educated to (? advantages 3046     100  1.2.1situation.E. S. M.
of works. At present, however, it is (? not omitted) (V worth while) to contemplate important works by any of the above-mentioned technical services unless Indian-skilled labour, (? and) to some extent unskilled labour is available, and I propose to try to (&apos;? conclude) some definite understanding with Government of India on this head, and will inform you in due course of result.The financial situation is this. Railway Budget Estimates for (? 19)2.1-22 must he prepared at once and depend on your decision in regard to general policy and source of supply of funds. Immediate capital expenditure is required, and even if railway w7ere at once to show a profit on working (which is not likely (? for) first few years), it is clear that outlay required cannot be met from revenue and that it will be necessary to raise a loan. The same remark applies to other capital expenditure which is likely to be required in the (&apos;?future).The capital expenditure required for railway(Vs) during next few years was described in my predecessors telegram No. 200, and letter No. 26713, dated 14th September 1920, when outlay for next six years was roughly estimated at 6,000,000 spread over that period, minimum requirements tor coining financial year being estimated at 70 lakhs.On present basis of (? revenue) and expenditure Mesopotamian State is not in a position to&apos; meet services (sic) of a loan. Concrete proposals are, however, under consideration for improvement of revenue and (? reduction of) expenditure. On assumption that it will be found possible to obtain surplus sufficient to meet charges of a loan of approximately 6,000,000, spread over next six years, what would be attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards request for such a loan, and on what terms of interest and repayment would it be risen (? given). Alternately, on above assumption, would His Majesty&apos;s Government be prepared to guarantee such a loan raised from other sources. I would emphasise that our association with Mesopotamia, and responsibility we have (? accepted in the inexperience of it, impose upon it a scale of expenditure which demands development of (? works of) utility and other paying enterprises on a commercial basis for which capital outlay is required. The fruits of our policy in Mesopotamia would be lost if development of country is impeded by withholding of further assistance, or rigorous exaction of repayment of money spent by His Majesty&apos;s Government on permanent works of value (? to omitted) this country.(Corrupt group) not be politic for His Majesty&apos;s Government to make a free gift to Mesopotamiau State o!: those capital works constructed here which are of lasting value and which the (? National) Government would wish to possess, eg., port premises and plant, railway&apos; lines and stock, electrical, plant, bridges, &amp;c. The cost actually incurred on these will probably never be known, while the real value to Mesopotamian State is very conjectural.Given stable political conditions (? I am) confident that with treatment on these (&apos;? lines) and drastic reduction in current expenditure, this country will be able to meet service of such a loan as above described.I gather from a recent question and answer in the House of Commons that, in the case of Palestine, His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to give such help.
