This Document ia th^ Property of241S   kf   Hla Offiannla IY!aj03ty&apos;3 governmentCirculated by the Secretary of State for India.SECRET.I have carefully studied the memorandum circulated by the President of the Board of Trade, No. CP. 2374, regarding the safeguarding of industries here. The measures proposed are bound to be highly contentious, not only from the point of view of the doctrinaire, but also from the standpoint of those who regard the reopening of trade with foreign countries, and the removal of existing barriers, as the main cure for our present troubles and the troubles of the world as a whole.The Bill will present itself to many as bristling with inconsistencies when considered, in relation to other elements of the Governments programme. In regard to finance, the Government have adopted a deflationist policy, which has as its objective the reduction of prices with a view to the mitigation of social stress, the reduction of expenditure and the revival of trade at a more normal level. The effect of the measures now proposed will be to check the tendency of prices to fall, and by the creation -of vested interests, to hinder tho resumption of normal trade relations with foreign countries hereafter.The International Financial Conference held at Brussels drew up a scheme for the grant of credits in favour of the distressed countries of Europe, so that they might obtain raw materials with which to restart the wheels of industry. This scheme has lately been considered and developed by the League of Nations at Geneva, but in the proposed Bill action is contemplated which is directly counter to the whole conception of the International credits plan, seeing that obstacles are to be placed in the way of the disposal of articles manufactured from raw materials acquired through the credit scheme. On page 7 of Sir 11. Homes memorandum reference is made, for instance, to hosiery, gloves and leather as industries whose claims to protection may require investigation. But cotton, wool and skins are just the sort of materials which, the credit scheme is devised to finance.No mention is made in the paper regarding the position of Russia, but if industry in this country is to be protected against German competition helped by the exchange, what will the agricultural classes say if they are not afforded similar protection against Russian foodstuffs when they again come forward ?These considerations arise directly out of the abnormal conditions now prevailing. But the measures contemplated in the Bill are also open to all the stock arguments against interference with the natural course of trade, some of which are of special force at the present time. A. stoppage of tho import of German toys may be to the advantage of those engaged in the toy industry in this country, but it has to be remembered that in so far as Germany is prevented from importing to the United Kingdom, so far is she also prevented from buying goods from the United Kingdom to the detriment of those engaged in other industries. There would seem, therefore, no reason to doubt that any reduction of unemployment in one direction will be counterbalanced by a decrease of employment in others. Meanwhile the prospect of Germany being able to pay the sums due on account of reparation will be reduced, and she will establish trade connections with the United States, South America, and Other countries that do not see fit to adopt a policy such as is now contemplated byThe President of the Board of Trade states on page I of his Memorandum that dumping; is not at present rife. On page 4 he states that the &quot; collapsed exchange provisions &quot; are to apply at once &quot; to all goods in the schedules to the key industries portion of the Bill.&quot; There is, moreover, no reason for any limit to the classes of goods that maybe brought within the scope of the collapsed exchange &quot; clauses. It seems to me, therefore, that for present purposes the collapsed exchange provisions form the most important element of the triple scheme,While, however, the points of principle on which I have touched above apply to each, part of the measure, the collapsed exchange provisions are open to special criticism. The criterion for scheduling goods under these provisions lies in proof after inquiry that goods &quot; are being imported into the United Kingdom at prices &quot; which, owing to the state of the exchange, are lower than those at which similar &quot; goods can be produced here, and that, as a result of this importation, employment &quot; in any industry in the United Kingdom is being seriously affected.&quot; This would not, however, appear to be the correct criterion. The position in Germany, as I understand it, is that costs of production there, including wages, have not risen in3045     100  1.21the Bill.
j)proportion to the depreciation of the exchange and the German producers are, there-fore, able to secure an exceptional profit. The continued use of the printing press, however, sets in motion forces tending to raise the local costs of production. For instance, wage earners, finding that the purchasing power of money is reduced, press for increased wages, which, as in this-country during the war, are always trying to overtake the upward movement of prices. Printing press finance cannot, however, continue indefinitely without a currency lapsing into the condition of the Russian rouble, and unless Garmany precipitately follows Russia&apos;s example, a time will probably come when, by the rise of local costs of production, the particular advantage to the exporter of a depreciating exchange will be removed. Thus, for example,&apos;]&apos;!: a currency us depreciated 100 per cent, and the costs of manufacture have risen correspondingly, the depreciation of the currency gives no premium to the exporter, and it cannot, therefore, be right to make the depreciation of the currency in itself the test as to whether or not British industry is being subjected to unfair competition. If, there-fore, the provisions in the Bill are to be based on sound doctrine, the scope of the inquiry, which is to be a preliminary to the scheduling of: goods, seems to require a change. I admit that it is extremely difficult to obtain accurate information, when conditions are always changing, regarding the costs of production in a foreign country, but unless this is done it will lie impossible to say how far our trade rivals are being helped by currency depreciation.Should costs of production in Germany increase hereafter in the proportion that the exchange has depreciated, the application of the test proposed in the Bill might virtually cut off trade with that country altogether. This is presumably not intended, but I would ask, how are we to get rid of unemployment if we impose measures which are calculated to dry up the buying power of our former customers? So far from helping in the solution of our troubles, these measures in restraint of trade are likely to aggravate them. They run counter to economic law and prevent exchange depreciation from obtaining its natural remedy, thus helping to perpetuate the very evil which they are designed to meet.It cannot be expected that the foreign exchange provisions in the Bill will satisfy the business interests affected by foreign competition. The proposals that the duty should only be levied when the mark is below Id. in value, and that the duty should in no case exceed two-thirds of the value of the goods, are based on no particular principle. The second stipulation will indeed act as a direct incentive to infintion by Germany, while from what has been said above it will have been understood that it is not the relation of the mark to the pound which determines the exporters premium, but the relation of local costs of production to the exchange depreciation. Again, as other war-worn countries recover industrially and become our competitors with the assistance of a depreciating exchange, will not the demand for protection on the same lines now proposed against Germany be insistent? The President of the Board of Trade recognises the limitations within which the new policy can be applied, but his arguments will hardly convince those whose appetite for State aid will have been whetted by the action now in contemplation.These considerations serve to illustrate the great difficulty of applying a system of restrictions against trade competition on the part of countries with depreciated exchanges, when conditions of production and currency inflation (or deflation) are constantly changing. If the prime desideratum of the moment is to get back to pre-war conditions of international commerce, the only wise course is to allow exchange depreciation to work itself out as an influence in stimulation of exports.This will occur either by a curtailment of imports, leading to an improvement in the exchange, or by a rise in local costs of production to the extent of the exchange depreciation. Any attempt to interfere with the working of these influences is likely to intensify present evils and to react to the disadvantage of industry here as a whole.E. S. M.3rd January 1921.
