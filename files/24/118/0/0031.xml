This document is the property of His Britannic MajestyV Government, ^SECRET.sCP. 2480.THE CABINET.PROPOSED REDUCTION IN THE GARRISON IN PALESTINE.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate a Memorandum by the General Staff on the proposed reduction in the    0152 Palestine Garrison, together with a covering note by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.In these circumstances I propose to reduce to (/;), i.e., 7,000 forthwith, without prejudice to any further reductions which can be effected later on.W. S. C.26th January, 1921.Note by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.We were instructed by the Cabinet to enquire into the possibility of holding Palestine with a, force of 5,000 men (ration strength). General Congreve has been consulted, and his views, in which I concur, have been obtained. The subjoined Memorandum by the General Staff brings out clearly the issues involved in three alternative proposals : (a.) A garrison of 5,000 (ration strength). (&amp;.) A garrison in the neighbourhood of 7,000.(c.) The increases necessary to carry out the High Commissioners policy of administering Trans-Jordania.The Conclusions are that (a.) Would be a highly dangerous experiment at the present time. (b.) Would be a justifiable risk; and(c.) Is a question of general policy, but the General Staff has already registered its dissent from any further extension of our responsibilities such as would thereby be involved.Henry Wilson, F.-M.,C.I.G.S.Memorandum by the General Staff.1. During the month of October, 1920, with a view to reduction of Army expen-diture and in order to return to India those Indian units which had been longest overseas, a scheme was prepared, and subsequently sanctioned, by which the garrison of Palestine should be reduced by the end of 1920 to the following : 1 British cavalry brigade.1 Indian cavalry brigade.1 battery, R.H.A.1 brigade, 11. F. A.3 batteries pack artillery.1 British infantry brigade (4 regiments).1 Indian pioneer regiment.1 armoured car company.The strength of this garrison, with its ancillary units, was in the neighbourhoodof-9,000 British, 6,000 Indian.(B21/56)   100   1/21   11 AS, Ltd  8867wo
2. This reorganization (with the exception that certain units, for climatic and special reasons, are wintering in Egypt, and vice versa, and that one British cavalry regiment is being retained in Constantinople), is now complete.3. Towards the end of December, 1920, in consequence of discussions in the Cabinet, further reductions were deqided upon, and a telegram (No. 87320, D.M.O., see Appendix B) was sent, on 23rd December, fixing the limit of ration strength for Palestine at 5,000 men, to be attained by 31st March, 1921. The General Officer Commanding, Egypt, was asked to give his views on this proposal.4. On 31st December, the General Officer Commanding, Egypt, replied (No. 5384 G, see Appendix C) giving his opinion that to reduce to 5,000 ration strength would invite rebellion and invasion.   A force of this size would contain onlv 2 cavalry regiments. 1 battery, R.H.A. 2 pack batteries. 2 infantry battalions. 1 L.A.C. company.The fighting strength of this force would not be greater than 2,500 men.He considered that the minimum garrison which it is safe to maintain would be : 3 cavalry regiments. 1 battery, R.H.A. 3 batteries pack artillery. 3 infantry battalions. 1 field company, RE. 1 L.A.C. company. Ancillary troops.or say a ration strength in the neighbourhood of 7,000.He further advocates occupation of Amman in Trans-Jordania, but points out that this would require an addition to his proposed minimum garrison of: &apos;1 cavalry regiment. 2 infantry battalions. Additional ancillary services.For purposes of comparison these forces are shown in tabulated form in Appendix A. 5. In considering the question of the size of the garrison, it is necessary to examine two main factors, viz : (a.) Internal security. [b.) External aggression.As regards (a), the General Officer Commanding, Egypt, points out that although the High Commissioner is optimistic with regard to Arab feelings towards us, we are nevertheless engaged in enforcing an unpopular policy on the country, and that we must expect disturbing influences to operate from without. The civil security forces are unlikely to be effective for a considerable period, so that elements of disorder must be met by military action.The main forces would be Concentrated at Nazareth and Jenin in the northern area, and Jerusalem and Ludd in the southern area. Should an outbreak of hostility occur, the small force in the northern area would be in a difficult position, stationed some 50 or 60 miles from the nearest British support.Although Jenin is connected by rail with Ludd, the railway is not of much value owing to a break of gauge. The roads between these two places are very circuitous, either passing through Jaffa and Till Keram or through Jerusalem and Nablus, the latter road being the best.As regards (6). Our greatest potential danger from external aggression lies in the region to the east of Jordan between the Lake of Tiberias and the Dead Sea. In this region there are only seven effective crossings of the Jordan.It will be seen at once that, with the smaller of the two proposed garrisons, none of these crossings would be covered at all, while with the larger garrison, three out of the four most northerly crossings would be immediately cohered by detachments, while two out of the three southern crossings could very rapidly be covered by detachments from Jerusalem.
Further, with Amman held, an attempt on either of the southern crossings would be met by this outpost, which would also be able to exert a tranquillizing influence on the country east of Jordan, and check the spread of trouble from the south should it show signs of spreading northwards.Nothing is said here as regards the political aspect of placing a garrison in Trans-Jordania in respect of our dealings vis-a-vis the French in Syria, as this subject has already been presented at length in other papers.Conclusion.6. With our national duty to support the new State which we have set up until it is strong enough to stand alone this paper is not concerned. It remains, therefore, only to consider the military aspect of the matter.We have to judge between three suggestions : (a.) To reduce to a ration strength of 5,000.[b.) To reduce to a fighting strength of nearly 5,000.(c.) To reduce to a fighting strength of about 7,000 in order to be able to occupy Amman.Would our military position be endangered by (a) ? Would it be safeguarded by (b) ?   How would it be affected by (c) ?The General Staff has no hesitation in saying that, both as regards internal security and external aggression, proposal (a) is dangerous. So small a force could only deal inefficiently and purely locally with internal trouble, and could do nothing at all to repel attack from without. It would be in danger of isolation in detail, and we should very probably be faced with the alternatives of a heavy loss in men and material (with its accompanying loss of our already diminished prestige), or of the despatch of large reinforcements in order to restore our position.Suggestion (b), under which we should be able to dispose of our troops on a more extensive scale, would tend to prevent internal disorder by the very fact of the presence of the troops, and, should such disorder arise, its suppression would b.1 facilitated and its spread checked.At the same time, the fact that it would be possible to close, or cover, the only entrances by which an enemy from without could approach, would not only enable us to oppose such attack at the outset, but would also make the enemy think twice before attempting it. It would also compel him to effect his concentration on the east side of Jordan, thereby affording us the time necessary to elaborate our system of defence, and to bring up reinforcements from Egypt or elsewhere.Suggestion (c) is, in the purely military sense, only an extension of (6), and its chief value is the moral and political effect which it would exert.We are therefore led to the conclusion that, of the three proposals : (a.) Possesses such an element of danger as to make it uisound. (6.) Would give the minimum decree of safety to which it would be wise to work, (c.) Would be desirable, could it be carried out, but is ho essential from the purely military aspect. IThe General Staff therefore considers that the Gene 1 Officer Commanding,. Egypt, should fee instructed to reduce the garrison of Palestir to the limits which he states as his minimum requirement, without prejudice to ai, &apos;t, decision which may be arrived at, from the political aspect, as regards Trans-Jordania&apos; \The reduction which would thus be effected over and abovt those reductions which have already been carried out would be 1 Indian cavalrv brigade.1 brigade, K.F.A.2 British infantry battalions.or, in lighting strength, about 2,300 British and 1,700 Indians.These reductions are those proposed by the General Officer Commanding, Egypt,, but, as a matter of general policy, the General staff recommends that Indian units be reduced rather than British.(Sb67)

D.M.O.) 23rd December, 1920.To be deciphered by a staff officer. Size of the garrison in Palestine has recently been under consideration by the Cabinet, who have come to the conclusion on financial grounds that, in view of the limited resources and population of that country, there can be no question of maintaining a force on the scale proposed in War Office telegram No. 86528, of 14th October, 1920. They are of opinion that 5,000 men, ration strength, is the maximum which they can provide, and that the future of the country must be entirely reconsidered if a greater number is required. They propose to reduce to the above figure by 31st March, and you should forward your considered opinion as to whether with such a garrison it is possible to hold all or part of the country. In arriving at a decision you may assume : (a.) That though British units may be substituted for Indians throughout, the garrison of Egypt will not be reduced below the strength estimated for in War Office telegram No. 86528, M.O. 2, of 14th October.(6.) That very considerable reductions may be affected by French in their garrison in Syria, whicfii would tend to effect the security of your northern and north-eastern frontiers.(c.) That the 5,000; cation strength would probably be all British and of any composition d jmired by you, including Air Forces.S        .....        .As the assistance to&apos; be obtained in the immediate future from locally raised forcesappears to be a deter; ining factor in the problem you should consult the High Commissioner when fra; j&apos;ng your reply.The matter is of j ime urgency and an early reply is requested. The Foreign Office is being asked tcl ,pmmunicate with the High Commissioner on the subject of this telegram.APPENDIX C.From General Officer Commanding, Egypt, to War Office.(No. 5384/G., cipher.) 31st December, 1920.Part 1.-Your No. 87320, D.M.O., 23rd December. The utmost I can count on from a total ration strength of 5,000 after deducting ancillary services and (?) Air Force is a fighting force of 2 cavalry regiments, L battery, B.H.A., 2 pack batteries,
2 infantry battalions, 1 light armoured car company. About 2,500 fighting men are left when sick 10 per cent, and employed (?) 15 per cent, are deducted. We are engaged (?) in enforcing unpopular policy on the country and cannot therefore guarantee quiet inside and must expect disturbing influences from Trans-Jordania and north-east (?) especially if French withdraw. . If Palestine were hostile 2,500 men would he in danger to say nothing of what would be certain to come From outside. I have seen Sir H, Samuel who is optimistic as to Arab feeling towards us. He proposes to commence at once enlistment of militia to strength of 1,000, using^for his officers and (?) nucleus cadre of Jewish Battalion, service of one year and three months a year after. It will be useless for Jordan Valley posts, as this force is likely to be European Jews. So little help there. Moreover, it is impossible for it to be at all effective before certainly nine months hence and the question of its administration is difficult I consider that under the circumstances the minimum garrision which is safe to maintain is I British cavalry regiment, 2 Indian cavalry regiments, 1 battery, R.H.A., 3 batteries pack artillery, 2 British infantry battalions, 1 Indian infantry battalion, 1 Field Company, RE., 1 light armoured car (? company omitted) plus ancillary services and 1 squadron, Royal Air Force. This force 1 would dispose as follows : North Palestine. 2 cavalry regiments, Jenin, with detachments at Roshpina, Semakh. Boisan. 1 infantry battalion. 2 batteries, pack, Nazareth, with detachments at Roshpina, Semakh. Half light armoured car company, Jenin, with detachments at Roshpina, Semakh.Part 2. South Palestine. 1 infantry battalion, 1 battery, pack, Jerusalem, 1 cavalry regiment (less 1 squadron, Beersheba), 1 battery, R.H.A.. 1 infantry battalion (less 1 company, Haifa), half light armoured car company, Ludd.It should be possible to keep Palestine intact with such a force until defence force can materialize, when it can be gradually withdrawn. Reduction to 5,000 ration strength now will invite rebellion and invasion. In view of stabilizing effect of (?) Amman, in Trans-Jordania, I still advocate occupation of that place.You have my proposal for this but it entails, in addition to above force, 1 cavalry regiment, 2 infantry battalions and ancillary services. If the garrison must be reduced to 5,000 all told, I must abandon Roshpina, Semakha and Jericho to concentrate. The administration is not in a position to hold these places. My dispositions would be-(a.) A North Palestine force at Jenin and Nazareth of 1 cavalry regiment, 1 (?)pack battery, 1 infantry battalion, and half light armoured car company. (b.) A South (?) Palestine force at Ludd and Jerusalem of 1 cavalry regiment,1 battery, R.H.A., 1 (?) pack (?) battery, 1 infantry battalion and (?) halflight armoured car company, with a detachment of 1 squadron cavalry (?)at (?) Beersheba.   I would earmark 2 battalions Egypt Canal area brigadeas reinforcements to Ludd.As Royal Air Force can easily be reinforced from Egypt, 1 squadron Royal Air Force at Ramleh, with aerodrome at Jeuin, is enough.
