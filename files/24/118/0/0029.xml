Your telegram of 31st December, 1502 S. Afghanistan. You are authorised to deal with questions of (1) Torkham, (2) Afghan Envoy, London, on lines proposed. It is understood as regards Torkham that concession must be limited to rectification Of frontier shown on map enclosed in Dobbs&apos; demi-official letter No. 2509, dated 14th October. I leave it to you to decide whether it is worth while insisting on proviso laid down in para. 10 of General Sheppard&apos;s note of 24th August. I am personally inclined to doubt advantage of a stipulation which might cause friction and would be very difficult to enforce in practice.)
