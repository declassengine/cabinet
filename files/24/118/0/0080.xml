Altogether  1,241,560 has been paid in grants to builders.The programme for the coming year may be judged from the number of preliminary certificates issued to builders, which new amounts to 30,118 including the 6,540 for finished houses,    Following the rejection of tho Ministry of Health(Miseellaneous Provisions) Bill by the House of Lords, an assurance has been given by tho Government that a measure legalising the payment of the full grant during the present year will be introduced early in the next Session, in order to reassure prospective builders9
3*   Housing; Sohemes undertaken by H,MtOffioe of Works.    It has decided that H.M, Office of Works should build for 35 local authorities and in 14 cases instructions have been given for work to proceed.    In a   number of the remaining cases, the negotiations are so far advanced that it is anticipated that authority to start work may be given very shortly.The number of houses and flats included in the 33 schemes is 9,239, and work has been commenced on schemes for 1,091 houses,     jThe question of utilising the services of the Office of Works is under consideration in 11 other cases040   Special Methods of Construction.    On the 16th December,proposal for the erection of 39,472 houses by special methods of construct ion were tinder consideration   Of these, contracts for 19,008 houses have been placed and contracts for a further 2,299 houses are being! arrangede    6,320 houses were in course of erection, !In addition to the above, Certificates &quot;A&quot; have beon issued [ by local authorities in respect of 4,307 houses, making the total [ number of special construction houses in course of erection 10,627J 5* Acquis it ion of Sites by Agreements The latest figures avail-I able show that in 5,189 cases negotiations for the acquisition of sites for housing purposes have been successfully completed, f The total area of these amounts to 22,157 acres and the prices. j asked by owners or provisionally agreed with the local authorities! amounted to  5,799,506 or an average of  261 per acre. The amount! agreed by the Valuers of tho Inland Revenue Department was I 4,200,384 or an average of  189 per acre tnus showing a saving of  1,589,122 or 27*6 per cent.    Up to &quot;the end of November,1920, I the latest date for which figures are available, 15,748 site3 of   f a total area of 89,571 acres had been valued by Valuers of the Inland Revenue Department * [60 Housing Schemes undertaken by. Building Guilds^, In order to I test the claim of representatives of labour that good results from I the point of view of output and economy would be secured by labour I
Housing, Scheme s. undo^alren. by^BuiIdlug Oullds (contd *) undertaking to build on a co-operative basis, the Department hassanctioned arrangements for contrasts embodying a total of some,500 houses between local authorities and Building Guilds.The majority of the schemes which have been approved are of comparatively recent date, but, in two of the earlier cases,^ -considerable progress has been made and the experience shows that the output obtained compares very favourably with that of other schemes and that the costs promise to bo lower than on many other schemes.    For example, at Bedwellty, where a guild scheme has been in operation for some five months, the costs up to the present indicate that If equally good progress is maintained; the houses when completed will be well below the estimate and. about  150 less than the average for similar houses in South Wales,Tho Guild system is an experiment being tried on a strictly limited scale as a means of securing the increased output and reasonable costs which have not been secured through building contractors.    The contracts are being watched carefully and results are being  tabulated for consideration.Objection has been raised by the Builders that the amount of establishment charges allowed to the Guild; on the estimated cost is too high, and to the payment by the Guild to its members 100$ of wages in respect of time lost through stress of weather and other reasons.    As regards the first point, the intention was to fix a sum which would merely cover oxpenses, and it has been agreed that if the expenditure shows that this amount is too high, a reduction will be made in future contracts.    As a matter of fact, in certain Builders1 contracts, the expenditure on these purposes has so far been in excess of the 6$ allowed to the Guild.    As regards the objection of tho Builders to the Guild distributing its profits on the basis of the amount of time lost, which arrangement the Builders say put3 the Guild into a preferential position, the question will be further considered in the event of new contracts being made,.
Housinn; Soho^os a    During the five weeks ending &quot;the 1st January, 190 sites were submitted by local authorities and Public Utility Societies.    The total number of sites, which had been submitted up to the 1st January? was 11,441 (allowing for deductions due to sites which have been withdrawn or had to be rejected as unsuitable or for other reasons).    The total area comprised in these sites was approximately 74.000 acres, which would provide for 740,000 houses,    Tho sites actually approved numbered 8,843 covering over 57,500 acres *    The total number of applications up to the 1st January for approval of lay-outs was 7,005, of which the Ministry had approved 6,423.   Up to the same date, plans for 284,480 houses had been submitted and of those the Ministry had given approval for 268,002,    Tenders had been submitted for 182,873 houses and of this number the Ministry had approved 171,525, 8*   houses in course of erection^   On the 14th January,141,068 houses were included in signed contracts, and on the 1st January, the latest date for which figures are available, 70,300 houses had beon commenced of which 13,422 were completed.Building by Direct Labour.    112 Local Authorities are now proceeding with building schemes on which they aro employing direct labour.    These schemes involve the building of 8,360 houses * Twelve Public Utility Societies are also building by direct labour on schemes which comprise 1,076 houses,

Cases have also been notified in Hempstead. Wood Green, Harwich, Bristol and in the Boston (Lines.) Port Sanitary District, 2. Tuberculosis^   As a result of a survey recently made of the operation of the tuberculosis dispensary schemes undertaken by Metropolitan Borough Councils after the passing of the National Insurance Act, 1911, a Circular has been issued by the Minister to these Councils making suggestions for the improvement of the service in certain respects a3. paternity and Child JeDfarOt   During December the Minister issued to local super-vising authorities, under the Midwives Acts,.a revised scale of fees (and covering Circular) for the payment by local supervising authorities to medical practitioners called in by midwives under Section 14 of the tola wives Acts&apos;, 1918,   This scale takes the place of the scale prescribed by the Local Government Board in December, 1918, and cane into operation on the 1st January, 1921, 4.

Poor_.La.Y_ (corrU^in London, in receipt of such relief.   The feature, to *vhich attention has already been drawn, of the restriction of this outdoor relief to [-articular unions continues very marked -thus of these 4,625 cases 4,236 have arisen in 11 unions, and 2,7^.1 in three unions (Islington, bhoreditch and */ands worth), The variation is not explained by any special circumstances such as the character of the local population..In the unions adjoining London a policy of outdoor relief has also been adopted in West Ham, Barnet, Edmonton, and ^illesden, arid a total of 3,671 cases are being relieved in those unions.Similar figures are not available for the whole countrybut the increase in the total number of persons relieved duringthe last fortnight is shown in the table below.

It having been announced that the Government were willing in the interests of economy   to introduce legislation providing for one register of electors only in the year, the Departments have been engaged upon the
