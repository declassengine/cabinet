The whole of the purchase contracts now being completed, the quantities shown as in store in Australia and New Zealand represent the total amount of meat to be lifted by the Government.iCONSUMPTION;Sales of Imported Meat for Consumption,Week ended	Total Sales Tons	Australasian Meat Tons	S.

In spite of this there have been occasions on which it has been difficult to furnish adequate supplies to all areas to meet the active enquiry created by the shortage of home-grown Mutton.TONNAGE,   The usual difficulty has been experienced in making shipping arrangements live up to the paper programme which had been prepared and the statement in my report to the Cabinet of 1st November, 1920, that it was hoped the Ministry^ Meat would be lifted by the end of February may not be realised. The delay arises both in the process of loading at the ports on the other side, and in consequence of shipyard strikes here. This, however, only applies to New Zealand as it will be observed fromthe attached statement that the whole of the Mutton and Lamb from Australia has now been shipped^SGDCHARLES A.
