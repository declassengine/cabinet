I T A L Y..The following report, dated 29.12.20 on the operations of the Italian Navy in the Piume and Dalmatian areas since the institution of the close blockade on Saturday, December 18th, has been received.The Naval Forces were increased by the addition of one Flotilla Leader and six  Destroyers, drawn from the Spezia Com.land, the whole remaining under the orders of Vice Admiral Simonetti^    Most stringent orders were given to the effect  ,. that all officers were to be armed, and that any man showing signs of insubordination was to be shot at once.   Vessels v/ere to cruise? when on blockade duty, in groups of three ships, so as to minimiss any chances of defection.    Any war vessel leaving the harbour of Fiume, without having first signalled her approach by W/t. was to be sunk.   On Saturday morning, December 25th? the old Destroyer &quot;Espero&quot; was seen leaving the harbour with, her torpedo tubes trainso)6n the bo am, and without having in any way signalled her approach.   She was immediately brought under the fire of the 8&quot; armament of the Flagship DAndrea Doria&quot;, hit by the second and third salvoes, she turned for the harbour, burst into flanes, and sank.The only other movement of rebel war ships was the placing of the old cruiser &quot;Marco Polo&quot;, recently sold, across the entrance of the harbour, with her bow to the breakwater, and her stern to the &quot;Pranz Joseph&quot; mole.   Laden with explosives and used, in this condition and position, as a prison ship for prisoners taken from the loyal Government forces, she effective-ly blocks the departure from Fiume of the &quot;Dante Alighieri&quot; and &quot;Mirabello&quot;.The former of these two ships still has her engines out of action, and can only move with the aid of tugs.The officers and men of.,both ships have informed the Ministry of Marine that they one and all remain loyal, and are prepared to fight to the last to prevent their being taken possession of and used by any of d&apos;Annunzic1s forcos.   their position in becoming precarious, as they are short of pro-visions and fuel.H.l . the Queen of the Netherlands was present at the launching of the Butch light cruiser &quot;Sumatra&quot; at Amsterdam on 29th December.   The sliip is intended for use in the Dutoh East Indies..The Dutoh Government has ordered over 1,500 miles of Submarine Cable from the N, German Marine Cable Works whioh will provide for telegraphic communication with the Dutch Indies.Sinoe Germany lias had to deliver her two Cable Ships to the Entente, a German tramp steamer will be transformed into a Oable-laying Ship and will start for the Dutch Indies shortly.CUBA,The Cuban Government has given the &quot;All America Cable Co.11 permission to land four Cables on the Cuban Coast. The projected Cables are believed to be Havana * New York; Havana h Mexico; Havana^- Guantanamo; and Guantanamo - Santiago de Cubai
ITALY     (Oontd.)The &quot;Andrea DoriaB has on three oooasions fired with 3&quot; guns at the official and private residences of dTAnnunzio, and also at the Barraoks occupied by the rebels.Light guns have fired at the &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; from the shore; the ship has &quot;been hit, but no casualties have occurred.   Part of the breakwater, the &quot;Franz Joseph&quot; mole, and other parts of the water front are stated to have been mined.. &apos;The morale of tho Naval Forces blookading Flume i3 now stated to be excellent, and no further oases of in sub-ordination have been reported since the defection of the &quot;Espero&quot;.On Friday, December 24th. at 6.30 a.nu a party of dfAnnunzio-s sympathizers, numbering three officers and 25 men aoclng in collusion with two petty officers and three men forming part of the crew of the Scout &quot;Marsala&quot;, embarked on board a tug at Zara and proceeded alongside the ship, which was at anchor off the Port.   The ship s Oompany were still in their hammocks.   Being aroused, they refused to Join up with the rebels, and gathered in the after part of the ship as a protection to their officers.-   The rebels were shortly followed by a party of Oarabinieri, who, after a short souffle, made prisoners of, the rebels and took them ashore.   On the departure of the Oarabinieri with their prisoners, the shipfs company surrounded the above mentioned two Petty Officers and three men  tore from their uniforms all distinguished badges, etc., and gave them a very severe handling.    These five men are to be oourtmartialled.The killed in all areas of disturbance, oomprising those of the Government and rebel land and sea forces, and the civilian population, since the beginning of hostilities, number about 30.BULGARIA.The&apos; Intsr^Allied Naval Commission of Control having reported that its work is now completed, the Naval Advisers have recommended to the Oouncll of Ambassadors that the Commission should be dissolved.BELGIUM.It has been decided to make an important alteration to the mole at Zeebrugge, the effects of which may be far reaching.   At present.the mole is a solid structure with the exception of a pier about one third of its length from  the shore,  li&amp;ore the British submarine was exploded during ,th3 attack on Seebruggo v/hich resulted in the sealing of the canal to Bruges..Tho pier was originally constructed in the hope that it would enabls the current to flow throu^i it and prevent sand and mud being deposited in the harbo&quot;jr.   But the effect of the pier has been the opposite to what was expected, and the current composed as it wa3 found to be of water from the Scheldt,,was too impregnated with mud for the plan to be successful.
**&quot; 4c &quot;BELGIUM    (OontdQExperiments have satisfied the Marine Department that by filling up the gap in the mole the tendency of the harbour to silt up wilii be much reduced.   The harbour v/as recently dredged so as to allow the Brazilian Battleship 11 Sao Paulo&quot; to enter the harbour and secure alongside the racle, when drawing over 29 feet.An American Shipping Oo. has sent a representative to Zeebrugge to examine the port with a View of its becoming eventually a port of call for transatlantic steamers.If Zeebrugge ever becomes an important port, it is probable that Bruges with the ports of Ostend and Zeebrugge, will take the place of Antwerp in the defensive organisation of Belgium and will form a defended area as a base for the Belgian Field Army.The prospect of the port of   Seebrugge becoming more important) than lias hitherto been the case, adds importance to the Belgian claim against the Dutch Government that the Yfielingen Channel is within their territorial waters.Tho Estimated Annual Oost of dredging the harbour is 50 million francs.
- 5 -PART   II.GENERAL   INTELLIGENC E.^SQpQTAMIA.The whole question of the disposition of our troops in Mesopotamia is under consideration, and it is possible that they may be withdrawn to a position covering Basra, after the North Persian BVeroe have evacuated Persia.The defence vessel &quot;Greenfly&quot; has been refloated.PERSIA.Commodore Morris and the remainder of the Naval Mission to Persia left Baghdad on 3rd January for Basra and Bombay.The British troops should loo in a position to &quot;begin their actual Tathdrawal from Northern Persia on 1st April&quot;; All military stores and impedimenta should be withdrawn prior to this date.The Shah has expressed his desire to absent himself from the country for two months in order to consult a nerve specialist in Paris,   Mr, Norman remarks that the real motive of his anxiety to leave the country is probably due to his wishing to &quot;be in safety when impending crisis occurs,   Mr, Norman adds that the flight of the Shah would help to hasten a revolution, which, in any oase, he believes to be inevitable if British protection is not continued in some form.RUSSIA.Moscow jr/^ reports that the Dutch Government has decided to alTow private trade with Russia,Russia.   Internal Conditions.   Prom a Polish source it is reported that troops &quot;are being moved by the Soviet General Staff from the centre of the country to the frontiers.   Chief Directions. Eastern includes Turkestan, Orenburg and Daghestan.   Tashkent is base of operations and agitation for Asia and India. *- &quot;There is no truth in the report of demobilisation, on the contrary, old soldiers mobilised and reinforcements of deserters and Communists likely.   Only trained factory hands demobilised.   Discipline has been intensified and for this purpose senior cadet classes drafted into units.ESTHONIA.New elections have taken plaoe in Esthcnia and it is stated that the present Government, elected on October 27th 1920, will resign.     General Laidoner is mentioned as a probable new Premier and that Professor Piip will return to London as Esthonian.Representative.Azerbaijan /
Azerbaijan.   Reports from the Georgian and Armenian frontiers indicate considerable withdrawal of Bolshevik troops towards Baku.   One explanation is that Moscow has ordered this withdrawal.   Another and more probable is that soldiers having heard of workman&apos;s week of pillage at Baku have decided to give themselves a similar week.   The workmen1s week of pillaging the bourgeoisie  was permitted by the Soviet authorities in the hope of calming discontent of workmen.I T A L Y.A report dated 30.12.20 from N.A, Rome gives the armistice terms signed between General calviglia on the part of the Government &apos;and by the Sindaco of Fiume and Captain Horst Venturi on the part of d&apos;Amiunzio as follows(l) D&apos;Annunzio surrenders his power into the hands of the citizens of Fiume, represented by tho Consiglio and Rettori.(2)     The Free state of Fiume recognises in full alb the provisions of the Treaty of Rapallo and binds itself to carry them out.(3)     A free pardon is granted to all officers and men who Joined d&apos;Annunzio previous to December 1st 1920.(4)     All D,Annunzio&apos;s troops are to be immediately disbanded.(5)     Free elections are to be held within the confines of the Free State of Fiume.The only provision of tho Treaty of Rapallo which is likely to cause difficulties is that relating to the Port of Barros, which, according to the Treaty, should be ceded, in conjunction with the Delta between the Canal e Fiumara and the River, to Sushak, i,e. to Jugo ^lavia.Press reports from Rome state that D^nnunzio will remain at Fiume until after the elections.   It is considered possible that he may be elected head of the State of Fiume.RUMANIA.The Rumanian Military authorities are mutch concerned by the possibility of a Bolshevik attack via Bessarabia.TURKFY.Unofficial discussions between representatives of the T3ntente Powers have led to agreement on the following points       ;(l)     The first President of the Military Commission of organisation and control with which post is combined the Supreme Allied Command, is to be British.(2)     The Chairman of the Financial Commission and tho President 0:? the Naval Commission are to be French,, and the Presidents of tho Straits and Air Commissions are to be Italian.All /
$PORTUGAL.The financial proposals of the Minister of Finance are meeting with considerable opposition and are generally regarded as being too drastic and sweeping in their scope.The fall in the exchange has been preceded by an even greater rise in prices and food&apos;riots are prevalent in the country districts.The steady flow of Portuguese subjects emigrating to the United states has recently&apos;diminished, a3 reports from the United States indicate many thousands of Portuguese over there are unemployed and that they will probably have to be repatriated.All these posts are to &quot;be held for two years from the coming into force of tho Treaty of Peace with Turkey j and are to be held in rotation by the representatives of the three powers so that for each two-year period the three chief Commissions should be shared among the three Powers. For this purpose the life of the Military Commission shall be extended from five to six years.
