14 1 11S E C F E T His Britannic *V?ajesly&apos;3 Government     4.1.21.CP.\2265.Every sympathy is felt by the Admiralty with the spirit cf the proposal put forward by the Minister of Labour it is also felt that a moral obligation is laid upon firms on the Admiralty list to qualify for the Roll wherever the conditions of industry permit apart from any inducement which may be held cut to them in the shape cf a Government contract.The Admiralty have during the last few months encouraged contractors to enrol themselves and in allotting contracts have given a preference to enrolled firms except in cases where extra cost to Naval Funds wculd be involved.They are however reluctantly forced to the conclusion that the absolute restriction cf contracts to enrolled firms even &quot;with certain necessary exceptions&quot; would be impracticable..      Many industries from which. E.M. Navy takes essential supplies are unsuitable for disabled men? e.g. coalmining) and it is equally certain that in many other trades the Admiralty would find it impossible to obtain the necessary supplies at all if such a rigid principle were applied.The Government or Government Departments would moreover be confronted with the difficulty cf deciding upon the &quot;necessary exceptions&quot;.      Any list of exceptions would be inadequate or inexhaustive and the consideration cf individual cases of exemption would inevitably become an invidious task. The procedure hitherto adoptedby the Admiralty has been to issue a slip with each tender asking the firm to state whether they are on the King1 s Roll, or not, and if not, what percentage of disabled men they employ.     Other things being equal preference is given to firms on the Boll.A record has been prepared cf the number cf tenders dealt with since the procedure came into force until the end of November.      The number of firms replying to the., enquiry on tender forms as to whether they are on the ring1 s Roll, or not, has been,Y e s. Ii q.1,257 917The number of contracts placed with firms on the King!s Roll,has been   520 as against 535   with firms n&amp;ton the Roll.It will be seen therefore that apart from cases where there were no enrolled firms tendering it would have meant a considerable financial sacrifice in the aggregate if the tenders of firms not on the Roll had been passed over and the contracts placed with enrolled firms./TheMeriS^ndum tor the Cabinst by the First Lord of the Admiralty,RESTRICTION OP GOVERMIIT CONTRACTS TO PIR&amp;SON THE KING&quot; S l&amp;TIOilAL ROLL
(Intlld.)    W. E. L. 4th January, 1921.The Ministry of Labour1 s contention that the Faxr Wags a Clause is an analogous case is net concurred in. The Fair Wages Clause in the long run makes for mere efficient and therefore mere economical production but it cannot be argued that the employment of disabled men -however desirable and obligatory from a patriotic and moral standpoint - makes for greater production&quot;It may also be- remarked that the whole scheme tends to increase the advantages which big firms have over small firms because the former with their large general staffs mighb find it easy to qualify for the P.c 11 &quot;&quot;whereas a small firm in the same jMns+ry might be unable to fit in the same percentage of disabled men*,/       If, however, it be decided to accept the principle of increased cost of Government contracts, the Admiralty would suggest that the present procedure be extended so that in dealing with competitive tenders from  (a) Firms on the King1 s Roll, and (b) from firms net enrolled, the extra cost that may be involved in giving preference   to tie former should be limited to a definite percentage of not mere than(say 2%) above the lowest tenders.     In every case where the lowest tender is passed over (partly or wholly) it is suggested that the difference in cost be debited to a. special head of charge and that these debits should be borne by a special vote for which the Ministry Cf labour might be responsible.      A lew limit is proposed as a safeguard against inefficiency in manufacture. .The fact roust not be lost sight cf that the Admiralty would be answerable to Parliament for any additional expenditure incurred through awarding contracts at higher prices to enrolled firms and passing ever ncn-enrclled firms whose offers were acceptable from the point cf view cf price, quality and rate cf delivery-The only absolutely fair way cf dealing with this problem would be to make the employment cf a proper percentage of disabled ex-service men obligatory cn all firms by statute but even then certain exemptions would be unavoidable.    Sbe scheme as it stands is a voluntary one and so far appears to have made good headway;, it is understood that 22,000 firms were enrolled up to the end of November employing 230,000 disabled men and that 20,000 men were still unprovided for.The Admiralty would gladly support the scheme by ascertaining at the time a tender is accepted from a firm not cn the Roll whether there is any valid and sufficient reason whysuch firm is net enrolled and to exert reasonable pressure upon them to qualify for admission to it.The Admiralty would however be placed in a difficult and invidious position if after a public announcement by the Government cn the lines proposed, they were compelled either to allot contracts tc non-enrolled firms or gc without the goods required.      It would be necessary th refore to give the Admiralty discretion tc award contracts tc non-enrolled firms for any goods for which firms cn the Rcll do not tender.
