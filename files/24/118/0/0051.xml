44(P 212) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 349&apos;10th January 1921.(Repeated to Minister at Teheran and Baghdad.),(Received 6 pan.)Clear the line.44 S. Minister Teheran&apos;s telegram of 9th -January, 20. It is not for us to intervene, but we cannot help feeling that Persia&apos;s best chance is to gamble on the sincerity of Soviet proposals (vide our telegram of the 5th January, 23 S.) and for Persian Government (even if Shall cannot be induced to do so) to stay (? in) Teheran up to last. Departure of Government from Teheran would be surely preliminary to setting up of some form of Soviet Government there by Persians themselves.Effect of Persia&apos;s collapse on Afghanistan and our present negotiations with Afghanistan would be very difficult to forecast. Much would depend on attendant circumstances. On the one hand it might impress Afghanistan with irresistible sweep of Bolshevism and our own (? impotence.) On the other hand, it might open Amir&apos;s eyes to the imperative necessity of excluding Bolshevism in any form from his own country.
