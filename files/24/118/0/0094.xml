GENERAL.The latter part of 1920 was marked by a general, if uneven, decline in the effectual influence of Moscow abroad, despite popular absorption, with more or less modification according to circumstances, of the principle of fraternity which Moscow theoretically acclaims. The imagination of the man in the street, once captured, has&apos; been repelled more and more, both by the visible blight spread upon Russia by tho Soviet regime, and by its leaders&apos; presumption in attempting to sot things right in countries for whose affairs their vision was obviously distorted. Traders also are being progressively disillusioned. The sharp practice and subservience to political ends of the Soviet Trade Commissariat are undermining Soviet commercial credit.Meanwhile thojnlluencc of Moscow upon Extremists in all countries appears to be waning with the lessening of its subsidies and the maintenance, or even the increase, of its pretensions.PRANCE.The Socialist Congress at Tours adhered to the Third International by a majority more than three to one. This decision leaves three important Socialist groups : the Extremists, under Marcel Cachin, Boris Souvarine, Frossard, and Vaillant-Couturier, adhering to the Third International of Moscow ; the &quot; Reconstructors,&quot; with Jean Longuot and Mayeras as leaders, adhering to the reconstruction of the Second Inter-national ; and the &quot; Resistors&quot; with Leon Blum, Marcel Sembat, and Paul Boncour as leaders, taking their stand by the Second International proper. The Longuet group of &quot; Reconstructors &quot; has decided to form a single organisation with the &quot; Resisters &quot; in opposition to the Communists.The Eleventh Correctional Court, as a result of proceedings initiated against the Confederation Generate du Travail by the Government, ordered the dissolution of that body on January 13th.The Extremist elements of the C.G.T. have gained control of the Union of Syndicates of the Department of the Seine, which stands in the same relation to the Trades Unions of the] Seine and Seine-et-Oise Departements as the C.G.T. is to the remainder of the Labour Unions.BELGIUM.Jacquemotte, the head of the Belgian Extremists, was reported, after bis defeat at the Congress of the Official Labour Party, to be devising a new International for Western Europe, for whose furtherance be was trying to promote a Congress of &quot; Les Jeunes Gardes Socialistes &quot; of the Western countries.ITALY.D&apos;Annunzio&apos;s Fiume adventure will not have been without advantage to Italy, to the beadier nationalism of which it has supplied a safety valve.PORTUGAL.The new Government is reported to be relatively strong and to be working hard at solutions for the urgent financial and economic problems. The railway strike ended ignominiously towards the end of November in the return to work of 80 per cent, of the men.a2
NORWAY.Communist intrigue has received a sovere blow in the failure of the strike of workers on the State railways, which was lavishly financed from Moscow.Lomonosoff has lately been reported to bo seeking to enter Norway in order to resume the suspended trade negotiations.SWEDEN.Only those extremists who helieve that a involution involving the whole of Western Europe is imminent find Lonin&apos;s 21 points acceptable. Professor Lomonosoff, the Bolshevik emissary to Sweden, is now charged to negotiate with the Swedish Government a commercial agreement of precisely the same type as that which M. Krassin has heeu negotiating in London.DENMARK.Renewed propagandist activities emanating from Stockholm arc reported. The Left Wing of the Social Democratic Party decided at the conference at Frederieia to join the Third International.The threatened industrial and financial crisis is reported to have made many converts for the resumption of trade with Russia.GERMANY.It is believed that Victor Kopp, and James Reich, his secretary, are being recalled to Moscow on account of their having embezzled a large quantity of the funds sent them for purposes of propaganda and trade.It is believed that, despite official denials, a Red army, not so strong or well equipped as the organisations of the Reactionaries, exists in Germany, and would oppose any reactionary coup that might be attempted, or, should the Bolsheviks conquer Poland or other border States after a declaration of war, avouUI act in conjunction with them or otherwise in favour of tbeir aims.SWITZERLAND.Martoff, the leader of the Russian Meusheviks, who recently left Berlin for Switzerland to attend the Extraordinary Congress of the Swiss Socialist Party, Avas told by Kopp before leaving that if he would use his influence with the Socialists in Berne to persuade them to join the Third International the situation of the Mensheviks in Russia would be improved.AUSTRIA.The state of affairs in Vienna is reported to he of the utmost gravity, and the President of the Vienna Police states that if no favourable announcement regarding the proposed credits is made before the end of January the whole structure of public order will collapse. He adds that Bolshevism is not only being invited, against everyone&apos;s wish, but is being forced upon them.Dutch, Swedish, and British firms are trading fairly extensively with Austria on the barter system. Raw materials are supplied from abroad, and 80 per cent, of the manufactured articles are returned to the country from which these raw materials proceed. The remaining 20 per cent, is left in Austria. In this way considerable employment is given to Austrian workmen, and the question of the exchange is avoided.   The
4aindividual who supplied this information has considerable business experience in Austria, and is of opinion that this is the one ray of hope in the situation.HUNGARY.The political and social condition of Hungary is regarded as unhealthy and dangerous. Any Allied steps to enforce disbandment of the forces concentrated in West Hungary will, it is believed, bo met with resistance.The parliamentary majority opposes the Monarchical aims of the ex-Emperor Karl and of Horthy, who have, however, many supportors in the army.CZECHOSLOVAKIA.The Congress of the Social Democrat Parly, which camo to an end on 29th November 1920, adhered to a democratic and constructive pro-gramme, and would have nothing to do with the Third International;RUSSIA.Trotsky has told the staff of the 11th Army at Baku that, though Wrangel is vanquished, counter-revolution is only commencing. The Moscow Wireless News of 22nd December reported that the Ukranian Extraordinary Commission had discovered plots on the part of the Left Social Revolutionary Party to overthrow the Soviet Government, and that the Party had been declared an enemy of the Republic.Further reports confirm the separatist tendencies of Siberia.Reports indicate that the agricultural situation is going from bad to worse. In all but four governments the area of cultivated land is decreasing and productivity is on the decline.BULGARIA.M. Stambuliski&apos;s negotiations for the construction of a &quot;Green&quot; or peasant international have now been extended beyond his immediate neighbours.TURKEY.Reports of a rift in the alliance between the Bolsheviks and the Nationalists may be interpreted as hints to the Allies to modify the Treaty of Sevres.PERSIA.The Persian Government has been endeavouring to arrange a modus vivendi with the Bolsheviks, but has been considerably perturbed by threatened Bolshevik aggression through the Republic of Azerbaijan and from Khorassan. The modus vivendi is embodied in a treaty negotiated by the Persian representative in Moscow in consultation with Teheran.EGYPT.The past month has been marked by the growing influence of the Moderates in Egypt, accompanied by some uneasiness among the Zaghloulites.THE CAUCASUS.The condition of the Caucasus is reported to be extremely disturbed. Anti- Bolshevik feeling is said to be growing. It is thought that a general movement strong enough to oust the Bolsheviks could only come from the Turks.
SIBERIA.The Bolsheviks are working for the dissolution of tho local assembly in Vladivostock, an event which might cause a reactionary coup (Vetat, resulting possibly in the formation of two buffer states in commercial contact, but under separate political control.CANADA.Unemployment is not only growing rapidly, but is assuming an air of menace. Extremists are, however, disorganised and quarrelling among themselves.UNITED STATES OP AMERICA.It is hccoming increasingly evident that the Soviet Government of Russia controls the sympathies of Communists in tho United States, who have considerable influence with radical adherents of other schools.Ludwig Martens, the Soviet representative in the United States, will shortly be deported for advocating a Soviet, programme to overthrow the United States Government, by force if necessary.
CONFIDENTIAL.A Review of Revolutionary Movements in Foreign Countries.PAET I.1. LATIN COUNTRIES.FRANCE. The Socialist Congress at Tours.At the conference of the Seine Socialist Federation in November it was announced that Ziuovieff had made certain concessions on behalf of the Committee of the Third International in respect of the famous 21 points, the most important of which would allow Longuet, Paid Faure, and tho Centrists to remain within the Party if they agreed to accept the decisions of the Congress to be held at Tours ou December 25th.At the Congress itself these attempts at conciliation were swept aside. The difference between the extremists and the Centrists was epitomised on the second day in a question by M. Vaillaut-Couturier. Speaking in the name of the Extreme Left M. Couturier asked M. Marcel Scmbat, &quot;Do you think that our abstention from adhesion to Moscow &quot; will change the financial and economic conditions which you say are &quot; inevitably bringing on the revolution and forcing the masters to &quot; undertake its repression by force ? &quot; M. Sembat answered, &quot; No, but &quot; that is not the question. We are gravitating inevitably towards &quot; revolution. So far we agree. But we differ in our opinion regarding &quot; the attitude we are to take up. 1 believe that we should prepare for &quot; the revolution on the model of the English workers&apos; organisations &quot; rather than in accepting from Moscow directions and methods which &quot; alienate French public opinion from us.&quot;A message from Zinovieff and the Executive of the Third Inter-national, describing the Longuet-Faure motion as filled with the spirit of reformism and of diplomatic craft and chicanery, and describing Longuet and his group as the determined agents of the bourgeois influence upon the proletariat, and as either neglecting or preferring to speak ambiguously of the Soviet system largely determined the outcome of the Congress which adhered to the Third International by 3,208 votes against 1,022.The Centrist group at one time offered to remain in the Party as a minority, despite a vote for Moscow, if the Congress would refuse to expel any members, would dissociate itself from the violent polemics of the Zinovieff telegram, and announce its intention of maintaining the present unity of the Party. This motion, interpreted by the Left Wing as a defence by Louguet of the Right Wing of the Party, was rejected. Thereupon the Longuet group of &quot; reconstructors&quot; announced that it had decided to secede from the Party, and, later, at a private meeting, decided to form a single organisation with the &quot;resisters&quot; in opposition to the Communists,
()Socialist unity is therefore broken. It had long been more nominal than real. It is improbable that the new coalition of &quot; reconstructors &quot; and &quot; resistors&quot; under Longuet and Paul Faurc will, for tho present, seek co-operation with the Radical Socialists. This would be to demand too much. The Congress at Tours leaves three important Socialist groups: one under Marcel Cachin, Boris Souvarine, Frossard and Vaillant-Couturier, adhering to the Third International of Moscow ; the second, adhering to the reconstruction of the Second International, with dean Longuet and Mayeras at its head ; and, finally, tho third faction, with oven more moderate tendencies, with Leon Blum, the dramatic critic, Marcel Sembat, ex-minister and wealthy collector and dilettante, and Paul Boncour, ex-minister and reputed millionaire, as its leaders.Of the three groups the first has the most success among the mass of Socialists, but the other two number the largest proportion of deputies in Parliament. Leon Blum was tho first to organise among his fellow deputies a Comite de Resistance against the suggestions of the Third International; he now has some 30 Socialist Deputies as followers out of a total number of 69. The second group (reconstruction to Second International) numbers 20 followers among the Socialist Deputies. Among them should be noted Marcel Sembat and Berth on. The first group (Third International) has 19 followers among tho Socialist Deputies, of whom we may monfion G heusi, Ury, and Varenne.On the other hand it should be noted that tho Socialist federations of the East, North, and West have all pronounced themselves with a strong majority in favour of the principles of Moscow, with tho result that in several regions there is a difference of opinion between the delegates of the federations and their members in the Chamber of Deputies. For example, those Deputies who have decided to follow Leon Blum have done so in direct opposition to tho votes of their constituents, who have declared for the Third International.So far the struggle between partisans of the Third International and Secoud International has oidy made itself apparent in the question of exterior propaganda and politics; in the Chamber of Deputies the Unified Socialists have remained unified in their opposition to the Government.The sensation of the Tours Conference was the arrival in the &quot; teeth of the police,&quot; as &quot; L&apos;Humanite &quot; wrote next day, of Clara Zetkiu, the Bolshevik emissary. The French Liberal-Conservative press was quick to note that the lady so lovingly described by Cachiu as a grand, pure individuality soon passed over the fraternal greetings and commonplaces of Socialist Conferences, and that the gist of her message was, &quot; We must revise the treaty of blood and iron dictated at Versailles.&quot; This famous Internationalist and emissary of Lenin, in short, spoke exactly the language of Herr Hugo Stinnes. -   -The Confederation Generate du Travail.The Eleventh Correctional Court on January 13th, as a result of proceedings initiated against the C.G.T. by the Government, ordered the dissolution of that body and fined MM. Dumoulin, Laurent, Lapierre, and Calvey each for their part in various strikes and manifestations during the last two years, and particularly in the railway strike of last May. The finding of the court was that the office bearers of the C.G.T., in addition to having infringed the law by failure to comply with the regulations in regard to the registration of their confederates, and the admission of unqualified trade unions to membership, had also been guilty of pursuing political and revolutionary aims which were outside the limits proper to the activities of trade unions.
The President declared that these revolutionary efforts were inconi-patihle with the prerogatives of the State. They attempted to create a State within a State, and to impose upon tho country the violent realisa-tion of its own political ideals.The point at issue was in fact the right to strike and the necessity of political action hy the working classes for economic ends. The Trade Union Law of 188-1 limits the activities of unions to non-political ends, and in fostering a general strike, which aimed at industrial revolution, the C.G.T. provided tho ground for its prosecution and the loss of its charter. One argument for the defence was that the Government had recognised tho O.G.T. by suggesting collaboration with the Conseil Eeouomiquo du Travail. It is probable that all tangible property of the C.G.T. will be found to havo been vested in subsidiary unions, and the C.G.T. will reform on the same basis under another name. The Govern-mont would probably have been glad to drop the case had that courso been open to them.The Union of Syndicates of the Department of the Seine.The union of Syndicates of the Seine Department is to all the Trades Unions of the Seine and Seine et Oise Departments what the &quot;Coufedera-tion Generale du Travail is to the remainder of the Labour Unions. It controls all tho Trades Unions of the two Departments and collects the membership fees for which it only is responsible to the C.G.T. It draws up the programme of meetings and form of propaganda in the Seine and Seine et Oise Departments. Until quite recently it had at its head officers of moderate tendencies like Jouhaux, who excluded Bolshevik propagandists from its Conference centres, with the result that the extremists were thrown back upon the Socialist Federation of the Department of the Seine, which sometimes commandeered meeting places in its own name and lent them to the extremists. Recently, however, the extremist elements of the C.G.T. have been elected to the Union of Syndicates, which they now entirely control. They will therefore be able to organise their meetings and propaganda as they please. They have already organised a series of meetings with anarchist tendencies ; the first of them quite successful. One of the first consequences of the altered political tendencies of the organisation has been the formation of an alliance let-ween Marcel Caehin and Tomasi, with the object of turning Jouhaux out of bis position and introducing Tomasi in his stead at the next National Congress in January. The ultimate object is to make the C.G.T. au extremist organisation, which would then co-operate with Cachin and the extremist Socialists for the furtherance of the principles of the Third International.Miscellaneous.Jacques Sadoul, the renegade Captain of the French Mission, who threw in his lot with the Bolsheviks, has been accused of misinforming the Soviet as to the attitude of the French working classes and their readiness to carry out a revolution. He is consequently in disgrace. His lodgings were searched in November, and Sadoul was temporarily liberated ; his arrest was then daily expected. The intrigues of another French Socialist lately arrived in Moscow are said to have precipitated his downfall.The report that three Communists, MM. Lefevre, Lepetit, and Verjean, perished at sea on their return voyage from the Congress of the Third International, has been confirmed by Moscow, but sinister doubts prevail as to the manner of their death.   Insinuations that a &quot; misadventure &quot;
liad befallon them have appeared in the press, and one paper boldly speaks of them as victims of Bolshevism. Their letters and articles had certainly shown no great enthusiasm for Soviet rule, and the suggestion is that they were &quot; removed&quot; as inconvenient visitors.BELGIUM.Extremists.Defeated at the Congress of the Official Labour Party, Jacquemottc, the head of the Belgian extremists, was reported in November to he devising a new International for Western Europe, for whose furtherance he was trying to promote a Congress of &quot; Les Jctuies Gardes Socialistes &quot; of the Western countries. In Belgium Les Jeunes Gardes Socialistes are not affiliated to the Third International or subsidised by Russia. Jacquemotte and his followers oppose the Belgium Communist groups led by W. van Ovorstraeten, whose affiliation to Moscow is more direct. Since van Overstraeten returned from Russia Communist agitation has increased and Belgian police are preparing to raid suspects, including Basil Chelgounoff, Boris Woulfert-Pokhitnow and other Bolshevik Russians. Jacqucmotto has recently doubled tho circulation of Ids newspaper &quot; L&apos;Exploite,&quot; the organ of &quot;Les Jeunes Gardes&quot; by a system of gratuitous distribution. The Jacquemotte party of extremists have recently been hotly engaged in the industrial regions against the official Labour Party. Vandervelde is reported to intend to break up the group as any cost. His hostility may cost Jaequeinotte his political immunity as a member of &quot; Le Parti Ouvrier,&quot; and may consequently lead to intensification of the revolutionary campaign. The Official Labour Party, by a majority of more than four to one, in which was included the Borinage Socialist Federation, one of the most powerful in Belgium, has authorised the executive to expel any member carrying on or taking part in a political organisation not recognised by itself, a step which means for Jaequemotte and his adherents either expulsion or the severance of their connection with revolutionary groups.The Socialists and Labour.The Socialists had consented by November to the presence of their members in the new cabinet, but the votes cast against the decision showed an unprecedented increase, caused, it is believed, by the refusal of the new Premier to promise a reduction of compulsory military service to six months. The labour situation which at the beginning of September was reported to be easy has more recently shown signs of degenerating under the pressure of the growing industrial depression. The industrial crisis is shoAving signs of becoming more acute, especially in the textile trade, where the number of unemployed is gradually increasing. Working hours have been reduced to 20 per week in many factories. Considering tho situation Trades Unions throughout the country have been urging the Government to requisition certain factories and supplies, pointing out that any temporary loss in exploitation would be less than the amount which the State would have to spend iu unemployment grant.In the iron and steel industries the factories are still reported to be returning to their pre-war efficiency. The crisis in the iron industry, although likely to become more acufe within the next few months, is reported not to be dangerous. Manufacturers are much concerned with increasing German competition, which threatens to overwhelm the small orders now being received from Great Britain and France.
The Eight Hours Bill was returned to the Senate early in December for modification of tho article dealing with the power of the King to suspend tho law under certain contingencies. Under the modifications the King may suspend the law in case of war or other events threatening national security. He is further empowered to do so in other cases of necessity on tho advice of the Superior Council of Labour or Industry or of Commerce. It was thought unlikely that Labour would seriously oppose that article.ITALY.Social and Industrial.In the earlier part of the mouth it was reported that the industrial crisis, aggravated by the attitude of employers and workers alike, was growing steadily worse. The employers foresaw bureaucralisation and ruin of industry in the control advocated by the workers, and were seeking to cut their losses by withdrawing from industry altogether. Credit had received grave injury and output was greatly reduced. Agnelli, director of the F.I.A.T., resigned, but returned ou persuasion by Giolitti.The workers, flushed by success, were taking reprisals against fellow workers who opposed occupation of tho factories. The idea of joint control spread rapidly. The Federation of Italian Spinners, inspired by the metal workers, formulated demands, including a national fund for the unemployed, a minimum wage for all workers, and payments of 85 per cent, to workers absent individually, and should work be suspended, 75 per cent, to workers absent collectively.A Parliament Bill for the control of industry provides, inter alia, for syndical control first over each industry and then over every branch of each industry, and also for strict secrecy regarding processes and methods of production. The controllers&apos; knowledge of finance and trade would lead to improved methods and increased production without hampering industry.The passage of the Bill raising the price of bread was expected to be followed by Socialist agitation, possibly leading to strikes and riots. Failure to pass the Bill would, on the other hand, entail the resignation of Giolitti or the dissolution of Parliament. The growth of unemploy-ment, financial trouble, for which paper palliation is to be sought, a threatened railway strike, and the Fiume question, added to the difficulties of the situation.D&apos;Annunzio and Fiume.From the moment of the signature of the Treaty of Rapallo d&apos;Annnnzio&apos;s adventure was made empty and meaningless. The enormous majorities by which the Italian Parliament ratified that agree-ment left no doubt about national feeling. Inability to find a way out consonant with his personal dignity prolonged the incident, whose climax would have failed except in face of Italian bullets and high explosives. In the fighting at Fiume the Italian Regulars lost 400 dead, including two colonels, while the losses of the Poet&apos;s Legionaries were 80 dead and about 200 wounded. These did not think &quot; that Italians were not worth fighting for.&quot; D&apos;Annunzio, a figure a little too consciously reminiscent of Cesare Borgia, will retire to the palace he has taken on the Grand Canal, the master of experiences carefully fostered. His adventure in Fiume will not have been without advantage to Italy, to the headier Nationalism of which it has supplied a safety valve.
The Fascisti and the Communists.In Italy lie leaves Fascisti and Bolsheviks arrayed in an enmity and aggressiveness which are not likely to decline for some time, though the Government tries to repress impartially the disorders of both sides. In an emergency, however, the Government would certainly not refuse the aid of the Fascisti as White Guards, a fact of which the Socialists, who really fear the Fascisti, are well aware. From the National Association of Combatants, numbering some 3,000,000 ex-Service men, the &quot; Fasci,&quot; young, hot-headed, ultra-Nationalists, have been recruited. The Socialists have their plans of attack arranged and have, or had, arms and aminuni-tlon in abundance in Emilia, their stronghold. It is known that these were stolen from army depots by soldiers, either Socialists themselves or bribed by Socialists to steal.The Socialists.The congress at Florence towards the end of November of the Unionist Communist Socialists to seek to maintain the uuity of the Socialist Party was poorly attended, only 15 out of 58 supporters of the movemeut being presold.. Zinovieff was reported to oppose the efforts of the Unionists, and to recogniso only the extremists, a fact upon which Bombacci placed reliance in persuading the congress to incline to that side. Serrati, the editor of the &quot; Avanti,&quot; complained of Muscovite misinformation and distortedness in supposing that the presence of Moderates in the Socialist Party caused the failure of the Italian revolution. The party decided to call itself the Italian Socialist Communist Party. It adheres to the Third International, of which it will form a section, and accepts Lenin&apos;s 21 points, with the addition of a twenty-second, excluding freemasons from the Third International. The unity of the Communist section appears to depend upon the success of Sorrati&apos;s mission to Moscow. Should Lenin accept the programme of the Unionists the solidarity of tho Party may be preserved and secession limited to the small group of extremists. The indications are that Lenin and the International, who are reported to despise the Italians as talkers only, will reject as Opportunist the Centrist views of Serrati and Nobbs, and will proclaim excommunication. In this case the negotiations now proceeding with Russia to secure moral and financial support from the Third International and recognition only of the extreme Secessionists arc likely to succeed. The Socialist Congress will be postponed, and the extremists will undertake a campaign to recruit additional followers.Arrangements are being made to hold an International Congress of the Revolutionary Socialist Intellectuals next February. The Intelli-gence Service of that body in Italy claims to have obtained proofs that certain Italian delegates to the Congress at Moscow purposely followed a wrong policy in order to bring about a split in the parties in Italy.Trade with Russia.The trade relations between Italy and Soviet Russia, purposely magnified by the Socialist Press, are languishing. A sort of Trade Commission was established by the Government, and by agreement between the Institutes of Italian Co-operatives and the &quot; Patrosoyuz,&quot; Italy was to send Russia medical supplies in return for wheat. So far only one cargo of wheat has reached Italy, and only one incomplete cargo of medical supplies a word to be freely interpreted has reached Russia. No practical results/ have attended schemes for trade by a steamer service between Naples and Odessa.
The Italian Government is rumoured to have consented to the nomination of Vodovosoff, representative at Rome of tho Russian Co-operatives, as Charge d&apos;Affaires in Italy of the Soviet Republic.A decree dated September 15th from the Peopled Commissariat for Foreign Trade lays down that a trade delegation of that body is being established in Italy consisting of five persons. The president is to be Comrade A. D. JNaglovsky, tho deputy Comrade V. P. Orlov. The members are Comrades J.M. Fischman, J. M. Karachan, and N. A. Orlov. For dealing with the Delegation^ current work an administration consisting of five departments, viz., operative, information, finance, transport, and admiralty, with separate starts and pay, is to be established.SPAIN.A new policy is reported in Barcelona. Hitherto it has wavered between vain attempts to root up the Sydicalist organisation and sur-render to the Terrorists. The new civil (formerly military) Governor, Anido, recognising that his official means are too weak to suppress crime, seems to have made use of the Sindicato Libre, an organisation com-posed of discontented Syndicalists. Finding itself encouraged, this society let it be known that for every &quot; Libre &quot; killed, they would kill three Reds. The Governor made this new terrorism an excuse for the arrest of prominent Syndicalists, on a plea that their lives are insecure, and deported them to Mahon. The organiser of the Sindicato Libre is said to be one Albareda, the owner of the Continental Hotel. An unsuccessful attempt on his life was followed by the murder of Recasens, the president of the Food Syndicate ; Layret, the founder of the Communist Party, has been shot dead, almost certainly by a Libre.Barcelona took the general strike optimistically. The Govern-ment appear to have forced the hands of the Syndicalists, who are unprepared for a decisive battle. The Barcelona Syndicalists&apos; attempt to cause a general strike in Madrid failed. There have been general strikes at Zaragoza, Seville, xllicante, and Valencia. At Valencia there was some bloodshed.   The country has now returned to work.Extremists seek to capture the conservative peasantry. A congress held recently at Jnen, representing 77,000 members of peasant societies in Andalusia and Estremadura, where the social-agricultural problem is most acute, favoured the establishment of a National Federation of Peasant Workers, and advocated adherence to the Russian Soviet Government.At the time of the general election most of the Syndicalist parlia-mentary candidates were in gaol. It was practically certain that Syndicalists as a whole would not go to the polls.The situation is well in hand, and the discipline of the troops is reported to be exemplary.PORTUGAL.The financial condition of the country is said to be very unsatisfactory. The Bank of Portugal holds cash in hand amounting to 27,300,000 milreis ; the amount of paper money in circulation on September 27th was 532,625,370 milrcis,
Meanwhile, there is some fear of the failure of emigration as a palliative. The American economic crisis is checking foreign emigration to the United States, where thousands of Portuguese are out of Avork and may quite probably have to be repatriated.The railway strike ended ignominiously towards the end of November in the return to work of 80 per cent, of the men. They went back, driven by hunger and having gained next to nothing, but it is reported that they mean to &quot;ca1 canny.&quot; Sabotage and the inexperience of ^lie soldiers caused considerable damage ; the former Avas reduced during the strike by the expedient of putting strikers in trucks at each end of the trains.The now Government is reported to be relatively strong and to be working hard at solutions for the urgent financial and economic problems. It is more likely to be weakened from Avithin than without. The group system, the bane of Portugal, has ended in the formation of a group in the Cabinet itself, which may one day attack the Prime Minister.The friction between the Republican Guard and the Fiscal Guard is said to result largely from the many privileges enjoyed by the former. Now that Liberate Pinto, chief of staff of the Republican Guard, is Prime Minister, with Cunha Leal, the unofficial leader of the Fiscal Guard, as Minister of Finance, the feud is for the moment composed. The officers of the Republican Guard, ostensibly either Democrats or Republicans, are reported to be in reality mostly Royalists who stir up dissensions. The present head of the Republican Guard, Lieut.-Colonel Oliveira Simoes, is a puppet moved by Pinto, avIio avouUI resume his post if his Government fell.2. SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES. NORWAY.The Railway Strike.Communist intrigue in Norway has received a severe bloAV, A strike of the Avorkers on the State railways, lavishly financed from Moscow via Rcval, began on December 1st. Public opinion Avas alarmed by the arrival of Bolshevik geld and by a sudden spraying of the country with Bolshevik propaganda. Olaf Scheflo, the notorious Norwegian ex-tremist, appears to have gone first to Stockholm and then to Moscoav for instructions, money, and assurances that promised arms and ammunitions would in due season be forthcoming. Scheflo had also to discuss the possibility of a Swedish general strike and to ask the Swedes for money, Avhich was given him. Strike funds of 6,000,000 kronen Avere said to be coming from Reval, and there Avere further promises of money from the Swedes, from the International Transport Workers at Amsterdam, and, it was reported, of 1,000,000 kronen from the British Railway Union.From the very first, however, signs of Aveakness appeared and the Volkets Hus Avas depressed. Although 12,000 men threw down their tools, 500 signified their willingness to return to Avork the same day. No disorders or demonstrations took place. The postal service Avas almost normal. All the bigger towns have ample food reserves. Except Avhere economic distress engenders impatience, the nation is non-revolutionary. The extension of the strike beyond the railway Avorkers failed, and its leaders realised that a raihvay strike alone would not bring Parliament to its knees. When the ballot for the resumption of work was finally taken 5,400 votes Avere cast in that sense and only 2,800 for a continuance of the strike,
Smuggling cf Bolshevik Gold.On New Year&apos;s Eve the Norwegian police raided the Labour Party and seized Bolshevik literature in Russian and English reported to weigh 21 tons, which it was later admitted by the &quot; Social-Dcniokraton,&quot; the organ of the Norwegian Labour Party, to have been received from Russia at party headquarters, contrary to the Import Prohibition Act of March 1918.The Norwegian Labour Party are apparently impenitent and admit that they have distributed Russian literature in Norway and abroad, and that they intend to continue the distribution. They are further contesting the legality of the confiscation. It appears that since the embargo on Bolshevik literature was instituted by the Government, parcels have been handed over to tho personal charge of travellers. The &quot; Social-Demo-kraten &quot; mentions Messrs. Snowden and Ramsay Macdonald as among tho recipients of the literature, and among the parcels seized some are reported to have been addressed to Sylvia Pankhurst.The Government decided to start legal proceedings against Kyrrc Grepp, Chairman of the Norwegian Labour Party, who will be prose-cuted for tho violation of the embargo on Bolshevik literature.The Norwegian Ship Owners&apos; Association has asked the Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Union to clear itself of a suspicion of assisting Russia, and has now cancelled its wages agreement with the Sailors&apos; Union.The &quot; Verdensgang &quot; Revelations.The &quot; Verdensgaug,&quot; a Christiania radical daily, about the same time published details of an alleged Bolshevik conspiracy, which was promptly denied by the Norwegian police. Certain extremists of the Labour Party, it states, some time ago planned a big strike movement to create panic in the capital and seize power. Fire was to be set to the great timber yards, and in the smoke and general confusion the police stations, military barracks and stores, telegraph and telephone offices, would bo occupied and military chiefs would be arrested, while the workers of the provinces would be summoned to march upon the capital.Communists and Anarchists.There are signs, especially in Syndicalist circles, that a movement towards anarchism is spreading and is not disapproved even by revolu-tionary leaders who profess Communism. The two doctrines are of course as the poles apart, your Anarchist being the Individualist in extremis just as the Communist is the Socialist purged of every inclina-tion for the freedom of the individual. Norwegian anarchist clubs, affiliated with and controlled by Swedish anarchism, are reported to have some 10,000 members.Olaf Scheflo, the well-known Communist leader, has been charged Avith the organisation of Communist propaganda among Norwegian farm workers and small-owners on lines approved by Moscow. His scheme for agitation among the peasantry provides for educational propaganda, technical training, and generally fitting peasants to become permanent small-holders in Communist society. The promise of economic advantages is held out to ensure their passivity during the struggles preliminary to the revolution.Lomonosoff has lately been reported to be seeking to enter Norway in order to resume the suspended trade negotiations between Norway and Soviet Russia, a
SWEDEN.The Socialist Party.The workmen who formed the staple of the party are reported in general to believe that their position cannot he improved by tho overthrow of capitalism, and to oppose adherence to Moscow. Only those ex-tremists who believe that a revolution involving the whole of Western Europe is imminent find Lonin&apos;s 21 points acceptable. A split in the Swedish Socialist Party on the question appears inevitable.The Deputy Vennerstrom and his friends have been taking steps to organise the Left Socialists against the conditions of the Third Interria-tional, and leaders of district branches of the party have been invited to a conference at Vasteras, where opposition to the party of the avowed Communists Z. Hoglund, Frederick Strom, &amp;c, will be organised. The Gothenburg branch of the Left Socialist Party has accepted tho Moscow conditions by a two-thirds majority.Extremists.The reported split in the Swedish Communist Party, whose minority Congress at Stockholm opened on December 12th, appears to have been less fundamental than was supposed. The majority did not desire secession from the Third International, but only proposed such revision of Leniu&apos;s 21 points as was necessary to forestall over-centralisation and bureaucracy.An anti-British campaign led by Communists is developing throughout Scandinavia. Propaganda denouncing British rule, especially in India and Egypt, and glorifying Russia by contrast is being largely conducted in workmen&apos;s clubs by extremists.Trade with Russia.In its broad lines the question of trading with Russia is the same in Sweden as in England. Swedes whose property in Russia has been confiscated by the Bolsheviks are protesting violently against LomonosofFs trade mission to Stockholm, and claim that they should receive compen-sation before the Government discusses trading with Russia. Socialists in the Riksdag, on the other hand, urge the Government to conclude a commercial treaty, and use as arguments the economic policy of England and Italy, the recent half-hearted advances to Russia of the French, and the Swedish industrial crisis. The powers.of Professor Lomouosoff&apos;, the Bolshevik emissary to Sweden, have been extended. He is now charged to negotiate Avith the Swedish Government a commercial agreement of precisely similar type to that which Krassin is negotiating in London. His two technical experts, Lavrof and Fren, declare that Itussia is perishing, and that all military victories will be sterile if the Soviet continues to allow itself to be hypnotised by the idea of unconditional Commuuism.Meanwhile, affairs within the Delegation itself are a pretty tangle of roguery and corrupt self-interest. There are dissensions between Asch-berg, the Swedish banker, on the one hand, and Kopp and Lomonosoff on the other. Aschberg in October succeeded in obtaining permission for the Bolshevik &quot; paper dictator,&quot; Averbach, to go to Sweden, where the latter was said to be prepared to place an order for 2,000 tons for use by the Soviet Government. A further quarrel between Aschberg and the Bolsheviks is the result of an alleged arrangement that orders for loco-motives placed in Germany should pass through Aschberg and Legien, and allegations that these have not kept to the conditions of the bargain
Lave made Aschberg threaten to denounce the activities of Kopp and Lomoiiosoff to the Soviet authorities. Kopp and LomonosofF entered into direct and corrupt negotiations with the Krupp Syndicate, and removed the powers given to Aschberg and Legien to negotiate with American firms, if Aschberg obtains no satisfaction from Krassin, to whom he has applied, he intends to refer the matter to Lenin.A certain Sehliesberg, a representative of Aschberg, is said to have asked Hellberg, tho Bolshevik agent, to make up the quarrel between Aschberg and Lomojiosoff. Montelius, Lomonosoffs Swedish collaborator, is said to be subsidised by Schliesberg to keep him informed of the doings of the Soviet Delegation, Schliesberg gets to know the prices asked for goods by the Swedes and Germans, so that Aschberg can compete with them. Aschberg has prepared plans for the supply of textiles to the Soviet at prices very much below those quoted by Ordentllcb. Lomouo-soffhas been reproached by Ordentlieh for having divulged the quantity of gold transported by him from Russia, but he defends himself on the ground that revelations were necessary to impress the financial and -commercial circles of Europe.The Engineers&apos; Strike.Shipping in Swedish ports has been much affected by a strike among engineers. Owners prefer to lay up their vessels in the prevailing poverty of sea freights rather than accede to exorbitant demands for increased wages. The fight is expected to be a long one. Traffic with England has not hitherto been affected.The Decline o  Wages.Contracts expiring on March 1 st entered into between various large companies and their bauds are to be renewed, the companies propose, on a basis which virtually means the reduction of the war bonus by 20 per cent. Notice has been given of the termination of these contracts by the tailors, the painting, and the tobacco trades. The Swedish Sugar Refining Company has made proposals for a new agreement, which includes a reduction in wages of 1G ore an hour per man, and 12 ore an hour per woman, the exact equivalent of the increase received by the workers when the agreement was concluded recently at the sugar factories.DENMARK.Extremists.Renewed propagandist activities emanating from Stockholm are 5&apos;eported. Danish Bolsheviks are being pressed by the Central Coni-mittee there to make use of the growing unemployment in Denmark to gain members for the party. The Danish Committee are to include a separate propaganda budget in their budget for 1921. The Finland Committee in Stockholm is said to have promised the Danish Revolu-tionary Parties support on condition that they unite, become purely Communist, and adhere to the conditions of the Third International. Six million kroner are said to be deposited in a bank in Stockholm for this purpose under the pretext that it shall be used for payment for goods. The Committee has bought a motor boat, lying at Helsingfors, which is said to smuggle political fugitives and others into Denmark. Stockholm has asked for particulars as to the most suitable type of literature for Danish peasants, which is to be sold at less than cost price, at the expense of the subsidisers. The Communist newspaper, &quot; Arbeidet,&quot; is, however, in such straits that the management is debating reversion to weekly from daily publication.   The Left Wing of theo AS 8592 b
Social Democratic Party deckled at the conference at Fredericia to join the Third International.The Financial Position.The deplorable financial position in Denmark is reported to bo duo largely to its having backed the wrong horse in the war, The Danes in 1918, when the exchange was about 155, purchased enormous quantities of German marks, the price of which has continually fallen until the exchange now stands at only II.&apos; Large holdings (especially Jutland, which bought most) cannot ho realised. Further, Denmark is over-stocked with goods purchased all over the world for transhipment into Soviet Russia, which, with the capital they represent, are held up until some satisfactory basis for trade can be devised.Trade with Russia.The threatened industrial and financial crisis has converted most people to the resumption of trade with Russia, Fear of Bolshevism among the predominantly agricultural population of Denmark is small. The Soviet Government is prepared to increase the gold deposit in Denmark, and has for some time been wishing to arrange important deals in leather and leather goods.Krassin has asked to know definitely whether Denmark will -become the centre for trade between Russia and America, and, failing that, for particulars regarding the present relations and position between the two countries.The methods of the Soviet in settling accounts with its foreign creditors and in using foreign contracts as political weapons are illus-trated by its dealings with the linn of Theodore Jensen, the largest seed business in Copenhagen. In November 1918 Vorovsky, the Soviet representative in Sweden, concluded a contract with Jensen to the amount of about 12,000,000 kronen, and a deposit was then made of 18,000,000 Russian paper roubles, then of some value. The seeds were sent to Russia on Litvinoffs assurance that the gold would be scut over almost immediately, but the balance of payment due, between 7,000,000 and 8,000,000 kronen, has never yet been received, despite reports sent by the Trade Delegation to Moscow. The Soviet excuses itself by saying that Jensen&apos;s is a Norwegian firm and that Norway has no diplomatic relations with Russia. But it is hinted that if Jensen could influence the Norwegian Government to commence diplomatic relations, the money would be paid next week. It is to be remarked that the contract also provides for the settling of misunderstandings in Sweden, where the Soviet has a commercial representative.3. CENTRAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HOLLAND.The Communists.Communists in Holland are continuing their efforts in the face of the discouraging attitude of the country at large. They are reported recently to have made several attempts to enlist in the Burgerwacht and to be seeking to cause unrest by extensive propaganda among the railwaymeu and transport workers. To a meeting of revolutionary intellectuals it was recently reported that Bouwman had received promises of support from foreign revolutionary leaders, including Robert
Williams of tho Transport Workers&apos; Association, in case .of militant Action by tho Dutch Transport Workers.An International Congress of Clerks and Shop Assistants was recently held at Amsterdam. It. adopted the Moscow programme and pledged itself to support Labour organisations which adhered to tho Third International. Both Wynkoop and Fimmen were given advisory votes at the meetings of the Congress. As the latter is the Dutch representative on the International Federation of Trade Unions, which adheres to the Second International, his participation in the meetings of the Congress may mean a change of view.2,180 native workmen, employed by the Corporation of Amsterdam, Avere sonteuced in November by the Arbitral Court to six days&apos; suspension Avithout Avages for abandoning their Avork without leave to demonstrate against the anti-revolutionary bill.The Amsterdam Bureau of the Third International. -Dutch Intellectuals havo been given to understand by Lebedjef that they are dependent on the Western European Committee of the Moscow Revolutionary Committee, and that their reports and information are to go to Ceton, secretary of the Western European Committee, the Committee in turn being dependeut upon Moscow. It is said that the Western European Committee will shortly become active in fomenting a revolutionary outbreak in Germany and in Avork in a French political crisis. Someone in Amsterdam has recently bought diamonds to the value of 15,000,000 marks from Kopp&apos;s secretary. These diamonds are believed to have been brought to Germany by ZinoviefF when he visited the Halle Congress of the Independent Socialists. One, supposed formerly to have belonged to the family of Joussoupoff-Elston, is valued at 1,500,000 marks. The funds realised are to be devoted to propaganda in Western Europe.Sinn Fein.Roman Catholie opinion on Sinn Fein has changed so remarkably and widely in Holland that it is suggested that a new policy has been dictated from a high quarter. Whereas some time ago Sinn Fein was held to be fighting for the Church and Avas supported accordingly, the Dutch clergy now deprecate the murders and declare that the conflict must be settled betAveen the British and the Irish people, and has no religious character.Talaat and Abdul Aziz el Shawish have had a conference in Amsterdam Avith the Amsterdam Sinn Fein Committee, to discuss, it is said, the advisability of forming an Irish-Egyptian Committee. The Sinn Fein Committee did not, however, approve of a joint committee, but favoured closer relations between Sinn Feiuers and Egyptian Nationalists on the Swiss model.GERMANY.The position of Victor Kopp.Late in November all indications went to show that the friction betAveen Kopp, the Soviet Government^ representative in Berlin, and the German Government had not diminished. Visas Avere refused to Soviet Delegates accused of being propagandists ; Madame Kasperovitch, acting as courier for the Soviet Government, Avas arrested. The lady and her documents were only released on a threat of commercial sabotage by Kopp. The compromising documents upon her included a letter from Axelrod, giving Kopp the names of all the agents in Germany who o as 8592 0
would cany on propaganda for the recruiting of German officers and soldiers in East Prussia to serve in tho Lithuanian and Soviet armies/ The un trusting &quot; Handulsvertragverein &quot; about the same time appointed a special committee to check statements made hy Kopp in a memorandum to the society dealing with the economic position of Russia and the re-establishment of commercial relations.Indicative of Kopp&apos;s diminished prestige is the fact that the repre-sentative to Berlin of the Soviet Government of the Ukraine, who has an office under the same roof as Kopp at Untor den Linden 11, will, in future, control the commercial relations between the two countries while Kopp deals with political questions.Again, a league for the furtherance of German trade has been formed in Berlin to trade with the Greater Powers and with Soviet Russia. The business manager, Dr. Rud Max, is in touch with persons sent to Berlin by Krassin ou a special mission to further trade. Krassin has kept them clear, of Kopp, who resents it and wants to bring their activities under the political branch.It has recently been hinted that Kopp is playing for safety, and it is noted that his political connections are rather with the Independent Right, whose press organ is &quot;Die Freihoit,&quot; than with the Communists and Spartacists. A German newspaper draws the conclusion that he is anticipating the fall of tho extremists, and hopes to be Consul-General under the German Government.Communists.The Communist &quot; germ coll &quot; system, more fully described in Part II. of the November Report, is said to be meeting with a measure of success iu the country districts. Propaganda on these lines is being carried on chiefly iu Pomerania and in Central Germany, and has brought about the foundation of the Communist &quot; Free Land Workers&apos; Union &quot; with its seat in. Saxony and some 30,000 members, a number, it is true, very small compared with the figures of other land workers&apos; associations. The system makes new blood for the Communist Party to compensate for the loss due to the purging of the party of its weaker members by the extremists, who realise that the moderates in any central position hinder the success of their plans.It is reported to be the general opinion of the Catholic clergy in Germany that Communist anti-clerical policy is more likely to react against the German Communist Party than to harm the Church. Definitely anti-clerical though the actual members of the Communist Party are, most of them, especially in the country, retain certain pious connections, and Catholics foretell that their propaganda will one day bring about violent dissensions iu working-class circles in which they will be the sufferers.It is believed that, despite official denials, a Red army, not so strong or well equipped, it is true, as the organisations of the Recactionanes, exists in Germany. The army of workmen under tho Red genera! start is said to number 200,000, and its commanders are reported to bo in direct communication with the Russian general staff&apos;. The equipment of this army consists of 304 guns, 550 howitzers, 56 aeroplanes, more than 300,000 rifles, 10 tanks, 15 armoured cars, over 100 minnenwerfer, and over 100 flammenwerfer. Internally, the task of this army would be immediately to oppose any reactionary coup that might be attempted ; externally, should the Bolsheviks conquer Poland or other border States after a declaration of war, its task would be to join up, if possible, with the Russian Red Army and act in conjunction with it or otherwise it)
486furtherance of its aims. Tho Spartakus Bund is said to possess seven well-armed fighting detachments in Berlin, with headquarters in Noukoln, Nogutstrasso. Ex-ofiicers act as instructors, and the concern is financed by Russia through James Reich.It was reported in November that 800 Russian troops, interned in East Prussia during the Bolshevik advance on Poland, have gone from Germany through Port Baltic into Russia.The German Revolutionary Syndicates are holding a conference at the beginning of 1921 for the purpose of starting international economic action. Anarchist syndicalist organisations in various western countries have decided to take part in the congress.A special Russian section of the German Communist Party in Germany consists of between 8,000 and 9,000 Russians.Syndicalists.An International Syndicalist Conference is reported to have been held at Berlin from the 16th to 21st December 1920, for the purpose of founding a new Red Revolutionary International Federation of Trade Unions.George Hardy, representing America, Franz Plivier, (Germany, and B. Lansink, Junr., The Netherlands, were selected to frame a resolution embodying the principles of the new Federation, the basis of which is close co-operation with Moscow, the maintenance of the class struggle, the abolition of the capitalist, and the establishment of the Communist State.A Committee consisting of Rudolf Rocker, Germany ; Jack Farmer (sic ? Tanner), England; and B. Lansink, Junr., Netherlands, were entrusted with the task of co-ordinating the efforts of revolutionary trade unions in all conn tries.B. Lansink, Junr., has been appointed secretary of this International Federation, and a bureau has been opened at 10 Nassaukade, Amsterdam.mOriental Affairs.One Alexandre Wosniezenski, chief of the Russian Foreign Com-missariat&apos;s Oriental propaganda, is to proceed to Berlin to win over the Irish, Hindoos, and members of other nationalities governed by England, to the Communist creed. If possible, he will get some of them to Moscow for training as propagandists, after which they will be fit to organise special propaganda centres in Switzerland and Germany. Part of Wosniezenski&apos;s task is to study the political situation in Germany and Central Europe and to organise a service of information with Geneva, so as to know all that happens at the League of Nations. VVosniezeuski&apos;s mission repeats the experiment of Narimauoff, now nominally head of the Azerbaijan Government, who was expelled from Germany for extending his Communist propaganda to the natives.The rate of exchange has attracted a very large number of foreign students, Scandinavian, Dutch, Swiss, Greek, Egyptian, &amp;c., so that there are now nearly as many foreign University students in Germany as before the war. The number of Egyptian students in Berlin is estimated at 280, and there are about 30 registered Turks. The Egyptians mostly come into Germany via, Italy. A Oriental club has been opened in Berlin as a meeting place for Turkish and Egyptian students. It is thought that these efforts to promote the social welfare of the students will lighten Wosniezenski&apos;s task.c 2
Reactionary Movements.Reports continue to be received that most of the officers and men of the armies of von der Goltz and Bermondt are settled near the East Prussian frontier. Rumour has it that they are so organised that the whole force can take up arms at any moment. In Bavaria the Monarchist movement was reported at the end of November still to be gaining ground. Kahr, tho president of tho Bavarian Council, thought the moment for the restoration of the Monarchy inopportune, but the fact itself possible at any time. lie was convinced that the French favoured it. In the meantime, the disarming of the Einwohnerwohren, though necessary, was difficult to carry out, since any attempt to enforce it might cause internal trouble in Bavaria and precipitate a ministerial crisis.In a confidential communication to certain local organisations, the German Communists allege a Franco-German intrigue against the German proletariat and the Soviet Government. The help given by the French to the German reactionaries is said to prove that the German reply to the note on tho Orgesch was arranged between the French and the German Governments. The necessity of local organisations arming themselves and discovering the Reactionaries depots of-arms is pointed out, and publicity through the press and Parliament is promised in due course.The German Independent Socialists aro said to have obtained an Orgesch circular announcing a secret conference shortly to be held in Bavaria to discuss the means of disarming, the attitude to be adopted, and the steps to be taken should the Entente persist in demanding real disarmament. Among the officers summoned to the meeting were Admiral Trotha, Generals Luttwitz and von Lettow Vorbeck, Colonel Bauer, Major Bischoff, and Captain Ehrhart.It is believed that 400,000 rifles are really available for use and the Einwohnerwehr will possess 221,000 after surrendering the 179,000 officially acknowledged. Its leaders envisage the continued illegal existence and- activity of that body, once they have got rid of the remaining Majority Socialists.Hen- Hugo Stinnes is reported to be organising an Intelligence system and was employing many ex-Intelligence officers and men of the Department of the German General Staff.Miscellaneous.The ex-Kaiser is said to divide his mornings between wood-chopping and writing his memoirs and to bore his household in the evenings by reading his literary efforts, which consist of personal memoirs of whose composition he desires the world meanwhile to remain in ignorance.During Camille Huysmans&apos; vjsit to Berlin in November he was given a lengthly memorandum on the preseDt ills of Germany, all of which were attributed to the Treaty of Versailles. Huysmans, who is secretary of the Second International, was asked to hand the memo-randum to the leaders of that organisation at a secret sitting. The refrain of the memorandum was &quot; The International must intervene in order to bring about peace in Europe.&quot; This transaction has a curious parallel in the despatch to the Tours Congress of the French Socialist Party of Madame Clara Zetkin with the message &quot; Above all the Treaty of Versailles must be abolished.&quot;Dr. Grabovsky, manager of the Upper Silesian Press Service, established in Berlin by the German Government, is said to have
extensive connections with the English press and to be very anxious to influence Labour opinion in England. He reports that Upper Silosian Communists will vote neither for Poland nor for Germany but for the Soviet Republic. In view, however, of a possilde new Polish-Bolshevik war, the Communists will, thinks Grabovsky, vote German. Official circles in Berlin, he says, believe that England does not wish Poland to have Upper Silesia.ft is reported from Gottingcn University that all students taking their final examination must now pass an examination in the Provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. This propaganda idea has been taken up by the German National Party. Graf Westarp, the party leader, will visit the University towns shortly to extend tlie scheme.A prominent oflicial in the German Foreign Office is reported to have said that Germany is ready to resume diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia at once, when satisfaction for the murder of Count von Mirbach has been given. As a concession the form of reparation will be left to the Soviet. Germany and Russia are economically necessary to each other, but their co-operation must have no military or political ends. Economic relations with the frontier states depend largely upon the result of future negotiations with Russia.The coal shortage is causing a spasmodic working of iron and steel factories. Even in the Ruhr valley some furnaces work only four days a week. The highest grade coal was ruthlessly worked during the war, and furnaces adapted to burn it are now suffering.The metal workers are said to have turned from Moscow, and to be likely to vote for the Independent Socialists at the next election.Voting at the recent Saxon elections show a swing to the Right. Socialist members in the Landtag have dropped from 57 to 49; bourgeois members have risen from 39 to 47. The U.S.P. has sunk from first place to fourth ; internal dissensions brought about many abstentions here. A cabinet coalition of Democrats, Volksparteiler, and Majoritaires is hinted at.Outside Germany feeling is growing that the fluctuations of the mark are caused by the German Government with the object of simulating an approach to bankruptcy and of profiting on rises and falls.The League for the Protection of German Culture, professedly non-party and non-military, opposes both Bolshevism and the Peace of Versailles, [ts agents are, apparently, numerous in Russia, and are to be found elsewhere in Europe and in America. In some quarters it is suspected of reactionary aims and of contact with the Orgesch. Its present propaganda is chiefly literary.SWITZERLAND.The political air has, on the whole, cleared. Socialists who are Bolshevists in all but name rely upon unemployment and trade stagnation to further their campaign, but the steadier members of the labouring classes have set their faces against extremists, and the understanding between employers and employed appears to have improved. Altogether it is unlikely that any Red outbreak in Switzerland would be of domestic origin, and an upheaval is thought to be less likely than at any time since 1913.The obduracy of Swiss workmen to Communist doctrine has forced concessions from the Committee of the Moscow International. Martoff, the leader of the Russian Mensheviks, recently left Berlin for Switzer-laud to attend the Extraordinary Congress of the Swiss Socialist Party
at Berne. On his departure Kopp told him, on behalf of tho Soviet Government, that the situation of tiie Mensheviks in Russia would be improved, and that they would lie permitted to publish their own news-papers if Martoff would consent to use his influence with the Socialists at Berne to persuade them to join the Third International. Kopp added, on behalf of the Committee of the Third International, that they were prepared to waive that Moscow condition which declares that only those Avill be accepted by the Third International who have been approved by the Committee of that Society. MnrtofF promised nothing, stating that he Avould follow his own lino of conduct.The meeting of the Extraordinary Congress of the Swiss Socialist Party to which ho proceeded rejected the Third International by 350 to 210 votes. The Conference considered the formation of a Reconstruction International to unite all revolutionary Socialists, and drafted and approved a manifesto calling for the-formulation of an International which will take into consideration particular conditions in the different countries of the Avorld.The dissident Left Wing arc awaiting the issue of a referendum to be held in February before finally seceding from the party, Avhen they may become either a Swiss Communist Party or a Swiss section of the Third International. The next meeting of the conference Avill be held in Vienna, where a constitution on the lines of the manifesto will be adopted. Though the Socialists come out of it weakened and threatened with divisions, the reconstructionist sense of the conference marks a slight advance towards extremism, the difference between the two wings being, perhaps, rather one of method than of principle. The February Conference will approve an International, and discuss Imperialism and the social revolution, methods and organisation of class Avarfare, and the International struggle against counter-revolution.Moscow is still engaged in pourparlers with switzerland with regard to the establishment of a telegraphic agency a branch of the Bolshevik agency &quot; Rosta.&quot;   Difficulties of management continue.AUSTRIA.The Crisis in Vienna.The state of affairs in Vienna is of the utmost gravity. The last phase is thought to be approaching, and it is seriously contended that only an immediate favourable announcement regarding credits can avert a debacle. Rumours, possibly of Bolshevik origin, are circulating in the town that credits may not be granted tit all. If they are not granted, Vienna, it is averred, will fall into the hands of the Communists.The following expressions of opinion from well-known public men of sound judgment and moderate views confirm the gravity of the situation.Dr. Alfred Gruenberger, the Food Minister, fresh from conver-sation with tne Prime Minister and Finance Minister, stated that the constant depreciation of the kroner causes a corresponding rise in the prices of vital articles, which in turn, results in constant new demands by State employees for higher salaries. Strikes occur daily in the various Civil Service departments. Regarding the latest demands the Govern-ment has succeeded in postponing a final decision until the middle of January, when it must either definitely (1) refuse the demands, a course which will cause a general strike of civil servants and a stoppage of the machinery of administration, or (2) accept the conditions Avithout having other means of providing the money than a recourse to the bank note. Only an immediate and firm promise of at least a portion of the Entente
488credits will solve the crisis. The complete interruption of the admini-stration would cause a lamentable effect upon the already irritated populace and would lead to the worst possible consequences.The President of the Vienna police states : &quot; If no favourable official &quot; announcement regarding the proposed credits is made within one &quot; fortnight from to-day, I cannot guarantee order in the city. The kroner &quot; will lose its value, the cost of living will rise and the existence of &quot; a large percentage of the population will become impossible. Christ-&quot; mas and New Year have acted as a narcotic. If no favourable &quot; announcement is made within a month the whole structure of public &quot; order will collapse. Bolshevism is not only being invited, against &quot; everyonc&apos;s wish, but is being forced upon us. Bolshevism in Vienna &quot; means that Hungary will inarch upon us. Czecho-Slovakia will dispute &quot; their right. War will recommence, Yugo Slavia and the Balkans will &quot; be drawn in, and another European conflagration will ensue. Law &quot; and order will receive their death-blow. I admit to myself in secret &apos;k that the existence of Vienna now depends upon myself and the bank &quot; note printing press. The state is obliged daily to raise the salaries of &quot; its employees to keep them from starvation. It has no money ; new &quot; notes must be issued hourly ; every new issue reduces the value of the &quot; kroner ; every fall in the kroner induces a fresh rise in the price of food. &quot; I can guarantee order for 14 days longer, but the last stage has now &quot; been reached.&quot;An influential official of the Ministry of Social Welfare, described as a man of sober judgment and not in the least alarmist, says that the position of Vienna has never been so grave. The city has not got the funds to pay its employees on the 1st January, and can only temporise by promising to pay in instalments of 50 per cent, on 1st January and 50 per cent, on the 15th. In his opinion unless outside help arrives, the whole city may be plunged in anarchy by the middle of the month.Traffic Restrictions.Mr. Julius Moinl, the Thomas Lipton of Austria, a highly practical and experienced economist, maintains that the possibility of Austrian reconstruction depends primarily on the re-establishment of unhampered trade relations within the economic unity of the old empire. The agrarian population of Austria can feed itself and supply some of the needs of the rest of its inhabitants. For the activities of the non-agrarian population its oavh country can only provide a small part of the field. Commerce and finance, especially in relation to the districts of the old monarchy, which now form the Succession States, are of the greatest importance to Austria to-day. Complete freedom of traffic with free import and export of goods, and abolition of travelling restrictions for the individual is the first essential for their resumption. Austria, and especially Vienna, can only exist if they again become the commercial, financial, and intellectual centre linking up the Succession States and the Balkans. The difficulties put by the authorities in the way of foreigners wishing to visit Austria and the obstruction of goods traffic to and from foreign countries render impossible the restoration of those conditions on which the majority of Austrians depend for their existence. Among the worst obstructions are the passport restrictions, the travelling restrictions in the Crown lands, the stringency of Customs revision at the frontiers, the prohibition on the export of tobacco and bank notes, and the impeding of railway transport.Mr. Hoover, who was coming to Austria in the interests of economic reconstruction of&apos;Austria and the Succession States, is now detained in
America. The whole problem remains unsolved. Since the Hoover scheme is impossible, it is maintained in some quarters that tho only practical alternative is a British Industrial Bank operating throughout the old monarchy. In other quarters diplomatic pressure by the Entente powers is advised to make the Succession States commercially friendly.Conservative Peasant Parties.The Conservative Peasant Parties in Austria, Hungary, Bavaria and Bulgaria arc reported to be showing signs of a rapprochement. Dr. Ileim, the leader of the Bavarian Peasant Party, was a speaker at the General Assembly of the Austrian &quot; Itcichsbauernbund &quot; in Vienna. Ileim talks of founding a &quot; Green International,&quot; including all politically and socially organised forces in Etuopean agriculture.President Schober&apos;s negotiations, which led to the formation of the Cabinet under Dr. Mayr, ended owing to the vacillations of the party representatives. The Gross-Deutsehe Partei was found to be less unreasonable than the Christian Socialists. It is not pretended that tho Mayr Cabinet can govern satisfactorily. Schober considers that Mayr will probably be appointed Bundespraesidcnt. This will allow the Christian Socialists again to charge Schober with the formation of a Cabinet.   His plans will be ready and the final obstacles removed.The Austrian Minister in Berlin, Professor Ludo liartmann, invited Kinoel, president of the &quot; Oesterreichische Deutsoho Schutzbund,&quot; to join in a secret conference of the Austrian and German delegates, with a view to discussing efficacious methods of propaganda.HUNGARY.The Reactionaries and Admiral Horthy.The political and social condition of Hungary can only be described as exceedingly unhealthy and dangerous. Admiral Horthy, whose aims for the re-conquest of Slovakia aud designs upon Austria are dealt with more at large in an article in Part II. of this issue, is reported to have 300,000 trained men, of whom 100,000 appear to be fully equipped. It is further estimated that he has 30,000 to 40,000 officers ready to take the lield, whom, even should they not be used, industry would be unable to absorb. The forces concentrated in West Hungary are under the com-mand of Colonel Lehar, and his Seoond-iu-Command, the notorious Pan-Gorman, Lt. Hejjas. Any Allied stop taken to enforce disbandment is pretty sure to meet with resistance. The troops are drawn up in such formations as lend themselves readily to an offensive against Austria or Czecho-Slovakia. Skeleton formations, which could be quickly mobilised and placed on a war footing, are reported to have been organised throughout all West Hungarian towns. The Government, meanwhile, can neither support the troops nor check their excesses, which threaten Hungary with a Communist reaction and menace surrounding countries.A &quot; White Terror&quot; closely connected with anti-Semitism has un-doubtedly existed in Hungary. The Hungarian noble, ruined by the agrarian changes of the revolution, found the Jews occupied every suitable profession or commercial position. Lt. Hejjas, Lehar&apos;s heuch-man, was released after one day&apos;s detention. Individuals who, like the new Town Commander of Budapest, Baron Geza Lukaschitch, take energetic measures against the Terrorists have all sorts of obstacles thrown in their way. The nomination of Baron Lukaschitch was opposed by Horthy as he was in favour with the Legitimists.
Many schemes for the restoration of the Monarchy exist. It is said, that earlier iu the year ilorthy himself entertained serious thoughts of putting himself on the throne. The Minister of Justice is reported to have been &quot;drafting a law defining monarchical powers in view of a restoration of the Monarchy after the consolidation of the country. The parliamentary majority opposes tho claims of the ex-Emperor Karl and of Morthy, who have, however, many supporters in the army. Tho success of either would be certain to produce serious civil war. The powerful Small-holders and Peasants Party is reported to be chiefly Republican and in favour of a very limited Monarchy under a foreigner, if king there must be. The Hapsburgs, says one report, are disliked by 90 per cent, of the Hungarian peasants. Au unterrorised plebiscite would probably show an anti-Royalist majority. The ex-Emperor told adelega-tion which invited him to the throne that he could not accept the crown until order was restored in the country. Horthy declares himself loyal to the old regime and a Legitimist, but is at the same time prone to be led away by the flattery of the Five and his military supporters.The sentencing of the Peopled Commissaries.Sentence was pronounced on December 28th in Budapest ou the People&apos;s Commissaries who acted with Bela Kun during the communist regime in Hungary and who remained in the country. Four of the accused, Vantus, Bokanyi, Agostou, and Haubrich were condemned to death on the gallows. The remaining six, Bajaki, Dovcsak, Nyiszter, Kalmar, Kelen, and Szabades were sentenced to imprisonment for life. Of the ten none was of the violent type of extreme communist, and it is believed that some at least remained in Budapest after the collapse of the Communist regime on some sort of guarantee from the Entente represen-tatives. Agoston is a University professor who served as Commissary for Foreign Affairs ; Haubrich, a metalworker, was military commander in Budapest; Vantus, a builder, was Commissary for Agriculture; Bokanyi, a stonemason, conducted the Commissariat for Social Welfare. Bajaki aud Dovcsak were both metalworkers and became Peopled Commissaries for Trade. Nyiszter, a peasant, was Commissary for Agriculture ; Kalmar, a printer, was in the Educational and Propaganda Department, and Joseph Kelcn, the Commissary for Socialisation, was an electric-technical engineer whose research work had interested Professor Einstein, so that both he aud Mr. Bertrand Russell intervened in his favour.It may be that the courts&apos; verdict is intended to give Horthy the opportunity of exercising his clemency, but if he does so it will now have the appearance of yielding to a threat. For the Soviet Government holds in confinement Hungarian prisoners of war, many belonging to rich and distinguished families in Hungary, and has announced that if the People&apos;s Commissaries in Hungary are executed a number of these prisoners of war will be shot. The sentences have indeed all the appear-ance of excessive severity. Specific murders have been charged against one or two individual Commissaries, but ail ten alike are dealt with as though they Avere responsible for the Avhole terrorist campaign carried on under the Communist regime.Count Karolyi.The work done at present by Count Karolyi. is reported to be the obtaining of intelligence for the Bolsheviks, chiefly on. military affairs in Poland. His agents are said to have beeu instructed to give all assist-ance, financially and otherwise, to Bolsheviks wishing to get to Moscow, Avork for which Moscoav has thanked him.
Kafolyi worked with Dumba at the beginning of the war. His main agent was Dr. George Kuh, formerly correspondent of the &quot;Neues Werner Journal,&quot; who, after his expulsion from America with Dumba, entered, on KarolyFs instructions and in his pay, the American S.S. and worked under the American Naval Attache at Copenhagen. Another agent was Frederick Kuh, now correspondent in Vienna of the &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; which recently published au interview with Karolyi.Karolyi does not assume the leadership of the Progressives, fearing that his death might follow tho discovery that he works with Bolsheviks. He waits for tho position which will bo his if the world revolution succeeds. He decided that a letter asking him to assume leadership at Pecs was a trap and went again into hiding.CZECHO-SLOVAKIA.The Social Democrats.The congress of the Social Democrat Parly, which came to an end on November 29th, adhered to a democratic and constructive programme and decided against exchanging democratic parliamentarism for the rule of the Third International. The Congress determined upon a policy of gradual socialisation, the separation of Church and State, and the speeding up of land reform. The party decided to be represented at conferences held by organisations not members of the Second or Third International. Nationally tho party desires understanding and co-opera-tion on Republican principles of freedom and equality. Speakers denouncing conditions in Russia were censured by the Left, Avho claim that the conference is playing fast and loose with true socialism and shows the beginning of a counter-revolutionary tendency.Russian Social Revolutionaries.The Russian Social revolutionaries are reported to have made Prague a centre of activity. They are in touch with the Cadet Party and with the Co-operatives in Russia and have a branch in Berlin connected with Russia via Reval. The &quot; Brusvit,&quot; an association in the Social Revolu-tionaries&apos; interest, publishes a daily sheet called the &quot; Volya Kossij,&quot; and is supported by,the Czech Government. The Social Revolutionaries hope for French support, but are stated to consider the present British policy the best for dealing with the Soviet, though manufacturers in Czecho-Slovakia looking for markets in Russia have so far been unsuccessful, and the lack of exchange goods has rendered fruitless the secret negotiations conducted by certain manufacturers with the Russian Co-operatives.The revolutionaries&apos; real aims are reported to be the overthrow of the Bolsheviks by a coup d&apos;etat and terrorism, and the establishment of their own regime. Socialisation of the laud will be their chief popular weapon in Russia. Kerensky, the leader of the Revolutionaries, whose masonic and Jewish connections perhaps explain his growing influence in Paris and elsewhere, recently had an interview with President Masaryk. It is doubtful whether he will obtain official Czech support.Tin Communists and Magyar Propaganda.Attempted Communist risings caused some bloodshed in Prague early in the month, and in an ejection of the Communists from the Volkhaus several were killed and wounded. The Communists&apos; attempt at a general strike completely failed, the Communist newspaper itself calling for its
Unconditional cessation. Prague soon became normal, and the question of a general strike was referred to the Trade Unions.A Communist courier from Moscow to Prague is reported to have carried jewels for distribution in the following quantities and ultimate use of Bolshevik propaganda : 6,000,000 kr. worth for Vienna. 5,000,000 kr. worth for Prague. 1,000,000 kr. worth for Sofia. 5,000.000 kr. worth for Bucharest. 2,000,000 kr. worth for Budapest.A Czeeho-Slovakian Bolshevik Delegation was reported to have met certain agents of Horthy at Budapest late in November, when Magyar propaganda in Slovakia was discussed and the political agitation arranged in preparation for military enterprise in the spring. The Delegation was apparently attracted by the bait of funds, and Horthy&apos;s ambitions in Slovakia lead him to fall in with the designs of the Bolsheviks in that country.The chief aim of tho secret Magyar Propaganda Bureau in Prague is the re-union to Elungary of all former parts lost through the Peace Treaty. Ladislav de Tahy, the Hungarian Consul General in Prague, has frequent interviews with the Austrian Consul, Dr. Ferdinand Marek, to which considerable significance may be attached.The League of the Sudeten Nations.This League, founded by Joseph Korcc, formerly on the Austrian Hungarian staff in Prague, is ostensibly pacifist, but in reality German Irredentist. It has a newspaper called the &quot; Volkerbund &quot; in Karlsbad, and claims to be connected with E. D. Morel and the Union of Democratic Control in this country. Morel is said to have promised all possible assistance to the Germans in Czecho-Slovakia. Korec himself states that his people arc ready and armed, and that &quot; were Bolshevism to break &quot; out, Bavaria would have an excuse for interference and everything &quot; would go smoothly.&quot;Foale Zion.The Right and Left groups of Poale Zionists are reported to be closely connected with the leaders of the Right and Left Social Democrat Parties. The extreme Poalc Zionists work discreetly, recognising the strength of anti-Semitism, and wishing to preserve their fellow Jews from the consequences of over-zealous advocacy of Third International principles.4. RUSSIA AND THE BORDER STATES.RUSSIA. Attempts at Counter Revolution.A copy of a telegram dated December 12th from Trotsky to the ,staff of the 11th Army at Baku has been obtained. It states that, though Wrangel is vanquished, counter-revolution is commencing; throughout Russia agents of the French and British are working ; that capitalist and Imperialist agents are causing people to disobey instructions ; and that sabotage and desertion have greatly increased. Trotsky appeals to all citizens to fulfil their duty towards Russia, which is threatened. Recalcitrants will be shot without trial.   Should three-quarters of the
population bo destroyed, the remaining fraction will still bo devoted to the cause of the revolutionists.It is difficult to determine how far tho motive of this communication may be the maintenance under arms, despite their unwillingness, of large bodies of troops for ulterior military purposes. But it is at least possible that the counter-revolutionary development described may lie identical with the counter-revolutionary plot fomented by the Social llovo-lutionaries, which is said to have been discovered in Moscow late in October. Tho Soviet is known recently to have been much disturbed by the secret work of the Social Revolutionaries, and even to have contemplated the transfer of the work of the central organisation from Moscow to Petrograd.The Moscow Wireless News of December 22nd reported that tho Ukrainian Extraordinary Commission had discovered plots on the part of the Left Social Revolutionary Party to overthrow the Soviet Govern-meut and that the party had been declared an enemy of the Soviet. The Chresvichaika, it was said, had not been able to trace all those implicated, and only arrested one group of the conspirators.From another source it is announced that the revolt was within a few hours of success, but that its betrayal at the last moment occasioned the arrest and execution of many of its leaders. Presumably the plot-was given away from the inside. There is reported to be much treachery amongst the Intelligentsia, and the best agents of the Cbresvichaika are said to be those who, either through lack of character or their mental exhaustion, would betray anybody for a pieco of bread.It was apparently the intention of the Social Revolutionaries not to bring the matter to a head so soon and to concentrate upou propaganda in the meantime. Secret issues of their newspapers are known to have been in circulation, but the Party, while preparing for further action, is believed to have recognised the impossibility of direct action against the Soviet Government for the moment. The plot has been followed by open threats of reprisals. The &quot; Pravda &quot; early in December declared that the destruction of the Social Revolutionaries was second only to that of the counter-revolutionary Generals. The Social Revolutionaries were denounced as servants of capitalism, and a proposed understanding between them and the party of National Freedom was said to have been arranged. The &quot;Pravda&quot; quoted the Cadets newspaper &quot; rule,&quot; published in Berlin, to the effect that a union between the Cadets and and Social Revolutionaries would result in the adhesion of all the other parties of the Right and the formation of an anti-Soviet block.Kerensky&apos;s recent visit to Paris is said to have been connected with negotiations for a postponement of a renewed attempt by Bermondt until the Social Revolutionaries have made their trial. Kerensky is said to have promised the Prague leaders, as a condition of their adherence to him, not to take the leadership of a successful revolution. Rumours that he was willing to come to an understanding either with tho Whites or with the Bolsheviks are reported to be without foundation. Bermoudt is reported to have severed his relations with Germany, to have turned to France, and to have consented to form an army under French direction and leadership. * Failing the consent of Germany to the formation of the army, co-operation was to have been sought with the German parties most likely to work with the French.Further reports confirm the Separatist tendencies of Siberia. The fact that the Siberian peasants are more advanced than those in Russia and consider that with their acquisition of the land the purpose of the revolution, so far as they are concerned, is attained, is thought to make
it possible that Siberia may break away ami establish its own govern-ment. A movement towards independence was also reported in November to be developing east of Archangel, when the breakdown of tho railways prevented the transfer of Soviet troops to tho points affected. About the same time an ex-officer of the old army, named Antonov, was established near Tamboff, at the head of a robber band of over 1,000 men, with which he exercised random control over a district superficially as large as England. Though too short of ammunition to be a serious danger to the Soviet Government, it had nevertheless found it worth while to undertake action against him. His case is said not to be an isolated one, and in the depths of the country, where Bolshevik control is attenuated, there are said to be hundreds of leaders of banditti like Antonov.Counter-Revolution Abroad.Early in December a special sitting of tho Council of Peopled Com-missars is said to have taken place in Moscow to discuss measures, against the anti-Bolshevik movement abroad. A secret circular signed by Dzerjiusky was addressed to all Soviet foreign missions, instructing them to make a register of anti-Bolshevik activities in order that their relatives in Russia might be sought out and arrested as hostages.Two other decrees signed by Lenin, Trotsky, and Zinovieff emphasised the need of terrifying, not only counter-revolutionaries, but also all those who support them.Political Divisions in the Soviet Government.The main difference in policy between the principal groups in the . Soviet Government is a question more of the means than of the end. Of the latter there can be no question. The Soviet Government is the guardian and mainstay of the Third International, between which and the capitalist system, universal in practice outside Soviet Russia and universal in theory outside the world-ramifications of the Third Inter-national, there can be do conceivable accommodation. Both parties in the Soviet Government, therefore, are at one in desiriug, and in so far as may be, compassing the downfall of capitalism. The division between the Militants and the Compromisers, or &quot; Trade Party,&quot; does not, therefore, go deep, and is confined to the means only. Lenin, supported by Tchitcheriu, Lunacharsky, and Krassin, stands at the head of the party, which is said to favour compromise and trading commerce with the world outside Russia. Against Lenin&apos;s party and its majority in the Central Soviet stands the party of militants, supported by the provincial Soviets, called even in Russia &quot; alien,&quot; and having for watchword &quot; no compromises.&quot; Its leaders are Trotsky, Zinovieff, and Dzerjinsky, and it is supported by Bukharin, Kameneff, and Litvinoff, the latter of whom, despite the nominal leadership of Tohitcherin, really dictates foreign policy. The &quot; Alien &quot; party, which has military support, had the decisive part in the decision of the Russo-Polish question. The situation between the two parties was then reported to be intensely strained. It is possible that the internal pressure caused by the discovery of Social Revolutionary activities may since then have welded them more closely into one.The Red Army.The Russian General Staff report the satisfactory re-organisation, with losses of under 30 per cent., of the Red Army. It is alleged that many would-be deserters and absentees returned at the conclusion of peace, and that further detachments from Germany and Latvia have been
drafted back into &quot;units. Trotsky rewarded the Red victories by allowing the army a fortnight of rest and plundering. While the Soviet autho-rities express pious resolutions regarding the retention after demobilisa-tion of only certain classes, mainly professed Communists, they qualify their statement by affirming the necessity of keeping a considerable army for eventualities. It is further reported that many new recruits, most of them boys of 17 or 18, tho rest men of about 35, were arriving in Potrograd in December, and were boing sent to the various fronts after a few days of training.  -The return to Russia of the Soviet troops interned in East Prussia during tho Polish advance has now been accomplished.   The following figures show the number of German Army officers, &amp;c.,who have passed with returning Russian prisoners of war, and interned through Narva, en route to Soviet Russia from Germany during the period 1st June to 23rd November of this year :  5 general staff officers. 25 staff officers. 120 naval officers.300 artillery and machine gun officers. 5,000 military and trained Spartacists. 5 railway engineers. 70 technical work and factory Spartacists. 150 master armourers. 380 various specialists. The Germans are also said to be in charge of the newly-formed Commissariat for the Air and Submarine Fleet, and to be directing the building of submarines at Nikolaief.Chinese recruits were reported in November to be arriving in Russia for service with the detachment of Special Guards of the Chresviehaika in Russian towns.Military Objectives.The military intentions and objectives of the Bolsheviks are obscure, and the data lead to, at best, indefinite conclusions.General army re-organisation is reported on all fronts, especially the Polish. Other concentrations appear in Bessarabia, on the Volga, and in Turkestan. The Esthoniau Government believes that the movement of Soviet troops to the Polish frontier and the Pskov is directed against Poland or Latvia. Late in November many Red troops were reported to be massed on the Latvian frontier, and as far back as Vitebsk. More recently it is reported that the Esthonian Government considered that the reports of the concentration of Soviet forces on their frontier have been circulated by the White Russians to further their own aims, and to induce the belief that the Border States are in danger. The reported concentration on the Esthonian frontier through re-distribution of units in a northern sense appears to lack confirmation.Reports are, however, rife of great preparations for a fresh attaek on Poland in the spring, and munitions and men were said in December to be coming in abundance from Germany. Von der Goltz is alleged to have dated the Bolshevik offensive even earlier, and to have said that it was to be expected in January. Troops of various qualities, the techuical arms being reported as excellent, are said to be concentrated on the Polish front, and the Bolsheviks are believed to be making very good gas shells. Whether or not the Soviet Government intends to make use of the Russian Red Army for attack on Poland, it is reported as probable that Red Armies, after the pattern of M. kamenoffs now notorious &quot; Civic Militia,&quot; will be organised in Poland, which it is the intention of the
Bolsheviks to subvert from within as they did the Ukraine. The cou-ccntnition on the Polish frontier may combiue with the formation of these instruments of internal disturbance to force a favourable treaty upon Poland.40,000 Soviet troops interned in East Prussia during the Polish advance, which have recently passed into Germany, are, it is said, to form part of the Third International army now being formed in the Volga for a campaign in the East. German General Staff and army officers and German Spartacists who have arrived in Russia are, it is rumoured, to be assigned to this army.Meanwhile troops aro very reliably reported to have been sent from Turkestan, now the centre of active Eastern propaganda, to the Pamirs, and from the Caucasus to Odessa, Khiva, and Bokhara. Out of the million rifles captured from W ran gel and Petlura 300,000 are to be sont to Afghanistan and Turkestan to arm the population against British Imperialism. Others will be used for the Red Armies or smuggled to Turkey and Egypt.The Downfall of Balahovitch.The failure of Balahovitch&apos;s adventure is now said to be attributable to Petlura&apos;s defeat, of which Balahovitch was not aware, and for which he had not provided ; to the indifferent quality of a number of his officers ; and to disciplinary measures anything but sound. The interference of the Polish Command, which brought about sudden modifications of the plans and the division of the little army into two independent sections, were further causes of his downfall. Disaffection also showed  itself among sections of the troops.Relations with Great Britain.An interesting change in the personnel of the British section of tho Moscow Foreign Office was reported late in November. Joseph Fineberg who was charged with English affairs in the Third International, then left the Foreign Office and now serves the International only. This step is obviously intended to emphasise for purposes of policy in England the distinction really without a difference between the Soviet Central Com-mittee and the Committee of the Third International. In the negotiations with England the incidents which culminated in the departure of M. Kameneff raised the question of Soviet propaganda, and Moscow has found it useful in denying its part in propaganda in England to lay stress upon the psuedo-distinction between Moscow as a government and Moscow as the centre of the International. Rosenberg has left the Moscow Foreign Office for Siberia, and Litvinoff by his appointment as head of the Soviet Delegation at Rcval again reverts to the position which he held at Copenhagen of the most important political representative abroad of the Soviet Government. The return of Martens from America will also tend to increase Litvinoff s influence iu foreign policy.The progress of the trade negotiations with the British Government are still the most widely important of the Soviet Governments political activities. M. Krassin on his departure said that the negotiators seemed still to be unpleasantly far from solving the three big difficulties comprised in (i) the wording of the preamble of the trade agreement, (ii) the question of the price of gold, and (iii) the question of the immunity of the gold or goods which the Soviet authorities might send to this country in the course of trade. M. Krassin was of opinion that unless these were supplied t here could be no trade, however many agreements might be signed.   He defined the position as follows ; The British Government
having refused to accept the provisions which the Soviet Government wished to insert in tho agreement has now undertaken the responsibility of devising some other method of overcoming the difficulty.   -None of the methods yet propounded seems adequate to the occasion.   Tho British Government has indeed agreed now to issue export licences in respect of Russian gold brought to this country, but this proposal, iu M. Krassin&apos;s opinion, is so fenced about by conditions and limitations that so far from opening the world gold market freely to the Soviet authorities, it would only regularise and legalise their exclusion from that market, and would confirm instead of removing tho gold blockade. Should  the agreement be  signed without  the British Government changing its attitude on this matter trade could not really begin.   The British Government meanwhile, M. Krassin affirms, declared that a moratorium  clause providing for the postponement until after  the Peace Treaty between the two countries of any action against Soviet property in England would violate the constitution, and suggested that a small parcel of goods should, be imported and a case brought up in the courts.    Should that test case go against the Soviet authorities M. Krassin states that he has told the British Government definitely that the agreement will be regarded by the Soviet as null and void unless some means were devised of protecting their goods.   M. Krassin stated that he Avas given rather vaguely to understand that something would be done if the courts gave judgment against them.   It does not appear, however, that even M. Krassin has completely understood the position of a British Government in respect of the courts of law, which he apparently believes to be in some way amenable to Government pressure. M. Krassin was clearly of opinion that in the Sagor judgment strings bad been pulled against the Soviet authorities.   Clever engineer and able politician as he is, his knowledge of the theory of the British Constitution is somewhat to seek.Moscow is endeavouring to persuade the National Labour Party and leaders of the big Socialist Parties in Europe to agree to the principle of political strikes, by which it considers Labour can best obtain the maximum of political and economic power, and has sent a warning to the Youno- Socialist, Syndicalist, and other revolutionary Committees to be instantly prepared for active revolution. The British Railway Workers and Transport Workers&apos; Federations are reported to have refused Moscow&apos;s request that they should pledge themselves to a political strike if and when Moscow demanded it. The work of organising the disturbance of public order aud terror in forms suitable to conditions in Great Britain has been committed by Moscow to the charge of Tom Quelch, the representative in Moscow of the Communist Party of Great Britain.During the peace negotiations at Riga, Joffe, the Soviet representa-tive, is said to have tried, often with remarkable success, to enlist the sympathies of the British and American correspondents. His intermediary was H. G. Alsberg, a correspondent of the &quot; Daily Herald.&quot;Maxim Gorki, who, early in December, was reported as about to go with Lunacharsky, the Soviet Commissar for Education, to England, bringing jewellery and old masters for sale for purposes of propaganda, is now reported in the press to havo been detained by the Moscow Executive Committee and to be held in strict custody. The &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; with inimitable complacency, remarks that the Soviet Govem-ment is inclined to adopt the position that except in the case of officials it cannot grant any passports to travel to countries which have not recognised the Soviet Republic.
The Decay of Agriculture.The agricultural situation is worse. In all but four governments the area of cultivated land is decreasing. Productivity declines. Before tho war one dessiatine yielded 42 poods of grain, against a present yield of 35 poods. The peasants&apos; land is badly cultivated and 4,000,000 of their farms are almost without horses. Cattle have been unduly slaughtered and ploughing suffers. Out of 457,500,000 poods of corn prescribed for delivery for the whole of Russia in 1920 only 100,148,000 poods had been delivered up to November 11th. The returns from Siberia and the Caucasus are poor, since their corn transports are frequently stopped and commandeered by the authorities en route. It is stated that Siberia could supply 200 trucks of food daily. 928 persons have been shot for various offences during October against 1,206 during September.At the Agricultural Conference held in Moscow it was reported by one speaker that the unsatisfactory situation was due to illiteracy among the peasants. Education instead of the issue of revolutionary pamphlets was advised as a counter measure. It was argued that agricultural proficiency would improve if Communists of peasant origin were to return to the villages to act as instructors, since the lied Army has become strong under the leadership of the many Red commanders. Another speaker feared the hoarding of coin by the peasants and thought it would be necessary to fight this energetically. Non-party peasant delegates appear to realise that every village makes an inseparable cell in the economic body of the country and&quot; that an Agricultural Soviet is necessary in every village. These delegates fear that the Food Com-mittee would commandeer the best corn and leave only rubbish for sowing. One delegate contended that the peasants&apos; difficulties would be relieved only by State control of the whole economic apparatus of the country. A peasant who was told that he might speak his mind is said to have declared that Russia would have peace only when the Jews were turned out.   Until that was done the peasants should refuse to supply grain.Meat is more plentiful. The peasants are slaughtering their cattle to escape requisitions and because of the shortage of fodder. The requisi-tioning of milk is causing the. slaughter of milch cows. The reluctance of the people to make compulsory deliveries is shown by the establish-ment of a special tribunal in Armavir for the trial of persons failing to complete the compulsory corn and other deliveries.A German report mentions the failure, after that of the &quot; Commune&apos;&apos; policy, of the &quot; Co-operative agricultural &quot; scheme. The most intelligent workers break away in search of land of their own. The town workers are also drifting to the country, where they seize holdings without scruple. The peasant knows nothing of modern methods, and there are few hopes of Russia as a potential supplier of grain.Social and Economic.Speaking to the Supreme Economic Council on trade questions, Krassin is reported to have said that the Soviet caunot develop . the country without outside help. When conditions have sufficiently improved, however, foreign concessions will be withdrawn, foreign plant and capital confiscated, and the remaining foreign operatives suitably disposed of.Patrick Quinlan, an American Socialist, states that while be was in Russia he was asked by Lenin and Trotsky to write an history of the Agrarian movement in Ireland. He told them that if the Russian peasants learned how the Irish peasants united to overthrow feudalism and landlordism they would overthrow the Soviet Government in a week. 0 as 8592 d
Quinlan, who has been a Labour leader, declares that tho [principal drawback of the Russian Avorkers is their laziness &quot;they wore born lazy they live lazy, and they die lazy.&quot; Ou the other hand they stand privation that would kill anybody else, and the most surprising thing is that they are alive at all.Mr. Salnais, a Lettish engineer and a very reliable witness, who has just returned from Tamhoff, describos as one of the most extraordinary sights of his life the exodus of hundreds of thousands of peasants to Siberia. This migration is prohibited and the railway closed to the peasants, but they travel nevertheless by road, on horseback or on foot, with their wives and families and as much property as they can take. If they cannot sell their houses and belongings, they abandon them. Salt was very scarce, but after the peasants had travelled 1,000 kilometres to the Caspian to got it, there is now salt everywhere at 1,500 roubles a pound dearer than bread. Later travellers to the Caspian found all food and fodder consumed, and the whole road dotted with the carcases of dead horses.There is very little milk, and bread is so scarce in the towns that it is being made wholesale from acorns collected in the forests. Even children of two or three years have to eat this bread, which will cause a frightful child mortality. Adults suiter less severely, but some of them have died of the acorn bread and some of hunger. Where there are no forests the people gather and eat a sour plant called in England pigweed. The army is bootless and wearing &quot; lapti &quot; made from the bark of trees. Barbers are nationalised, but their customers must bring their own soap. Wages show greater discrepancies than ever before ; for instance, a prominent actor gets 50,000 roubles and a scene shifter 2,000 roubles a month. In the Czar&apos;s time the figures were 100 and 30 roubles a month respectively.Boys and girls are taught in common in the schools ; the children are terribly depraved. Even if the Bolsheviks fall, the children will retain Communist ideas. There is said to be a universal hatred of the Bolsheviks, but the English are even more hated, and an alliance with Germany is advocated.There is said to be strong opposition, especially among the labouring classes in Moscow, to the Decree giving concessions to foreigners. A split of the Communists may result. The Decree gives foreigners rights refused to Russians, and is in a way a capitulation to Capitalism.Coal and other Raw Products.The coal shortage is acute. Only 5,000,000 poods of coal per month are coming to the munition and machine factories. Only 30 to 35,000,000 poods out of 75,000,000 poods of steel required next year will be delivered. The cotton area amounts to hardly 23 per cent, of that formerly sown. Only 210,600 poods were produced in 1920 against 660,000 poods in 1918. Flax has fallen from 5,7000,000 poods in 1918 to 2,000,000 in 1920.Since the arrival of the Bolsheviks at Baku the production of naphtha has fallen from 30,000,000 poods monthly to 8 or 9 million poods, and the rationing system has been introduced.The Abolition of Money.Money is shortly to be abolished .in Russia. Paper money now circulating will be called in and annulled. Instead of it coupons will bo distributed entitling the holder to accommodation, food, fuel, &amp;c, according to his nominal income or salary. Individuals who acquire foreign valuta will hand it over to the Government, and be granted
receipts for it. Conditions are not likely to change greatly, since money is already almost of no value, and payments are largely made in kind. Tho peasants, who still keep large sinus of money buried, will probably bo incited against the authorities by this measure.Propaganda Abroad.Fren, a member of Lomonoson&apos;s mission to Sweden, says that Russian gold has been hidden abroad for future use. Lenin has declared that the Soviet must be ready to begin once more a hidden war, having in reserve the capitalist instrument of gold. Of the 20 cases of gold which may be expected to arrive, live will be sent to Germany, to Switzerland, and to Holland, where they will be hidden by trustworthy comrades.Two hundred pounds of platinum from Soviet Russia has recently reached Hamburg, and 3,500,000 pounds in gold are in Amsterdam ready for transit to England. Zinovieff has arranged for the distribution of this money on behalf of tho Third International, and has assigned the platinum to England and France for Bolshevik propaganda purposes.Negotiations with the Vatican.Strange negotiations are reported to have been proceeding between the Vatican and Tchitcherin, through the Tahmt aud Enver. The consider-able sums lost, after the revolution by the Society for the Propagation of the Faith are in question, as well as the protection of Roman Catholics in Russia.Borschinski, the Vatican agent in Berlin, finding after a visit to England with de Ropp, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Petrograd, that nothing could be done there, turned to Tchitcherin. Enver, who has been offered 12  per cent, commission on the proceeds of his efforts, held out hopes of doing something, until the recent reported eclipse of his influence at Moscow.FINLAND.The collapse of General Wrangel has encouraged Socialists. At a meeting of the leaders of the workmen&apos;s unions and professional organisations of the Viborg district, it was decided to ask the Government to nationalise some of the largest undertakings.The greater part of the Russian Delegation which is to proceed to Finland shortly is to be accommodated at Viborg, as it is thought by the Bolsheviks that this place would be a better centre for carrying on their . propaganda activities than at Helsingfors.   Viborg is well known to be the most revolutionary district in Finland.The Finnish Paper Trust are seuding to Russia about 225,000 poods of paper to tho value of 28,000,000 Finnish marks. The bulk of it is paper for printing money ; the rest of it writing paper and paper for tho press. Writing paper and paper for printing money are particularly short in Russia, and Duma and Tsar roubles, which alone have any value abroad, must be printed.Baltic States. ESTHONIAIn the.recent elections the Centre, generally speaking, lost to the flanks, and class warfare is likely to be intensified. There were Soeral Democrat losses, and extreme Left and Right wing gains. The Labour Party owe their success to efficient agitation, press propaganda, promises
of. social betterment, and a policy of encouraging trado. Tho Army vote seems largely to have turned Left; 80 per cont. of tho Kavel garrison voted Socialist. The Government has made a good start, and some prices have fallen.Responsible political opinion in Esthonia holds that the Soviet Government will work seriously at internal reconstruction now that Wrangel has collapsed. If reconstruction is too difficult, or if risings follow demobilisation, the Soviet may be driven to aggression, a contin-gency against which the Esthonian Government is taking all precautions. The Russian military authorities are establishing a special fortified line as a measure of precaution against Esthonia. This is the result of a secret military conference at which a suspicion was expressed that Great Britain would incite Russia&apos;s neighbours against the Soviet.The activity of Communist propagandists, both Esthonian and Russian, is increasing, but seems to be meeting with indifferent success. Esthonians have the condition of Russia before their eyes, and are not anxious to see it repeated in their own country. Ziuovieff directs the secret Communist work here, and 1,-100 Bolshevik agents supplied, it is said, with money to the amount of 5,000,000 roubles a month, have been sent from Petrograd. One of their duties is to report on British activities. Zinovieff&apos;s assistants, Sorgsep and Tender, are to recruit and organise infautry and cavalry detachments from Esthonian Communists. Soviet propaganda will probably try to use the elections for its own profit.The Soviet authorities continue to attach the utmost importance to Esthonia as an economic and financial centre. The wireless press reports that Litvinoff has been appointed as the head of the Bolshevik Delegation in place of Gukovsky, whose recent financial dealings, as well as his practice of letting certain personal friends of his slip away into Europe without sufficient reason, have brought him under suspicion. One such fugitive, recently a member of Gukovsky&apos;s delegation, states that the delegation was&apos; divided into two branches, political and commercial. The proportion of funds spent upon political work was as 14 to 30 spent on commercial work. When, however, commissions and other douceurs expended on the commercial side were taken into consideration, the amount spent by the two branches was almost equal.It was reported in November that a special Commission had arrived at Reval from Soviet Russia in charge of 6,000 poods of gold valued at about 11 million roubles and 10 poods of jewellery. The latter, obtained from Persia and Bokhara, were to be exchanged abroad against foreign currency. One member of the delegation is reported to have stated that the Russian gold supply was approaching exhaustion, but that 10 wagon loads of silver were shortly expected to arrive in Moscow.Two steamers were waiting at Reval ou November 10th for a load of 300,000 poods of gold for Stockholm.Moscow has charged Eiduk to work with Steninger, chief of the Bolshevik military espionage, on propaganda in the Border States, especially in Livonia.LITHUANIA.During November much activity in Soviet propaganda was reported. It took the line of decrying any orientation towards the Entente, and of working for the establishment of the Soviet system in Lithuania, for the federation of Lithuania with Russia, and for an alliance between Germany and the latter power.
Both people and Cabinet were then reported to bo opposing the Vilna plebiscite, of which the Cabinet desired the postponement until the spring, when a fresh Bolshevik advance against the Poles was expected, with favourable results for Lithuania as regards Vilna. The Government is reported to have permitted the formation of a Wliite-Ruthenian body of 10,000 men, officially intended to help the Lithuanians against the Poles, to work jointly with them in their own countries and secretly to form a nucleus for lighting tho Bolsheviks and moving on White-Ruthenia. There are 25,000 White-Ruthonian prisoners in Germany.There are indications of collusion between the German Mission at Kovno and the Bolshevik, Axelrod, who has reported to Tchitcherin that he can get daily information from the Mission regarding military formations in Poland. Axelrod has been told by the German represen-tative, Dr. Schcinberg, that the Germans are preparing to translate (heir anger with Poland over the two Polish corridors into action. Axelrod is said to be financed by Hugo Stiunes, for whom he obtained concessions in turf and other business, xl Major Fletcher, who, late in November, was reported to be running reactionary troops in Lithuania, was said to be dependont upon Axelrod for his funds. There is a German official statement to the effect that neither German troops nor German officers are to be found in Lithuania.Generally, German influence in Lithuania, while not yet dangerous, is well implanted in the country by German colonists, whose advice is sought by the peasants in their capacity of skilled agriculturists.LATVIA.Following representations from business circles, the Cabinet is considering the removal of the regulation giving the Ministry of Supplies the right to commandeer 25 per cent, of imported goods for State necessities, at prices fixed by them.Bolshevik propaganda grows, and is said to be quite successful in the army, particularly among the men of the Riga garrison.POLAND.The peace negotiations at Riga have almost reached the sticking point. The easier questions having been settled to mutual satisfaction, the negotiators have, as at London, come to the blank wall where no agreement appears possible. Discussion is now engaged regarding the gold question, and the Bolsheviks, who at the worst of the Polish advance in August last, when Wrangel was a menace in the south, accepted all the Polish demands, are now trying to go back upon their word., Among the demands conceded was the right of the Poles under the final peace settle-ment to a quantity of Russian gold. As victors in the war the polos claimed the right to be paid for the damage caused by the Bolshevik invasion into Poland. Further, basing their claim on their newly recovered independence, they demand their part of gold in the Polish State Bank, amalgamated at the end of the 19th century into the Imperial State Bank in St. Peters-burg. They have also advanced a claim for deposits in the branches of the State Bank throughout Poland.
When the Bolsheviks were hard put to it these claims were conceded. But tho situation lias now changed in their favour, and the threat of the lied Armies against Poland is being renewed. Bolshevik equivocation and sharp practice is being directed to the whittling away of their former acceptance of tho Polish claims.Meanwhile the results of Bolshevism in Russia, and more particularly the oppression and almost annihilation by the Bolsheviks of the class of small Jew trader in that country, are having their effect upon Poland, where influential Jewish merchants arc reported to bo inclined towards anti-Bolshevism. The emigration of the Jews from Poland, which alone could settle the Jewish question there, must be towards Russia, since Palestine cannot absorb it. Hence the financial assistance given by Jewish merchants to Savinkoff and Balahovitch. The Communists and the P.P.S. have now adopted a joint plan of action, the Communists supporting the P.P.S. in strikes and the agrarian question, and in return obtaining two ministerial posts in the new workmen&apos;s and peasants&apos; government, which both organisations hope to found by the New Year. Meetings of delegates of Soldiers&apos; Councils have been continuing with the cognizance of the authorities.The treatment of the civilian refugees who have followed the remnants of tho Ukrainian and Penuiki.u&apos;s forces across the frontier con-tinucs to embarrass the Government. If only to check the spread of disease it is necessary to concentrate the refugees, and against any concen-tration rise the problems of accommodation and the demand of Savinkoff that Russians should be treated as free men. Miss Vulliamy, the representative of the British Relief Committee, has a scheme by which it is claimed that, given official Polish co-operation, the difficulty might be solved. It should be specially noted that a Bolshevik Red Cross Mission is now in the country amply supplied with funds, including an abundance of doubtful French and British hank notes.It is reported that the result of unofficial Polish inquiries in Berlin as military support for Poland by G ennany against any possible Bolshevik attack, was disappointing.THE UKRAINE.In spite of Petlura&apos;s collapse the peasant rebellious continue. Peasant unions (&quot; Hriweuki &quot;) are directing a movement for the organisation of a peasant government. The peasant risings behind the front, both of Petlura and the Bolsheviks, are directed against both these regimes. Decrees have been issued prescribing ruthless methods of repression. One of these measures, which orders the confiscation of property &quot; for the benefit of local peasants,&quot; shows the uncertain standing of the Soviet in Ukraine. There is constant disturbance of railway communications. Troubles are reported generally, and the district around Kiev and Odessa is especially disturbed. These risings may either be part of a systematic Avar against Bolshevism or may show sympathy for a Ukraine govern-ment. Most probably, however, they represent simply a spirit of anarchy.On the pretext of unsettled conditions in the Ukraine, the German Government seized the 400 millions deposited, Avhen Skoropadski was Hetman, in the Reichsbank and the Deutsche Bank as security for goods required. It is out of this deposit that Vinnichenko, who recently escaped from Soviet Russia, hopes to receive funds for his Nationalist Party.
5. BALKAN AND EAST EUROPEAN STATES.GREECE.Internal peace is, on the whole, probable, despite the change of regime, aud reprisals will be limited in number. Rhallys, the Prime Minister, appears to have been elected again to allay Entente suspicions. A Moderate and no diplomat, he supported the ipolicy of Venizelos and tried to induce Constantino to join in the war on the side of the Entente. Soon after tho Greek volte-Jace local Germans were reported to anticipate that the recent turn of events would be favourable to them, and not to see how the French Military Mission and the British Police Mission could remain. It is also reported that Greek pressure upon the Turks is likely to be lessened. The visit of a former Turkish Minister to negotiate a separate peace is announced from Constantinople, and the Greek army, it is said, will gradually retire to the original line.No less than 690 large estates in Greece, more than half of them in Thessaly, have now been broken up and sold to the people. Most of the 130 Macedonian estates were old Ottoman Government property. The Communist agrarian programme, aiming, like that of the Liberals, at giving the laud to those who work it, differs from it iu substituting confiscation for purchase, and the handing over of estates to the Com-muuity or Soviet of the district instead of to the cultivators themselves. The Communists would give full self-management and independence to the local bodies, denying the right of the State to intervene on local questions. They would annul all previous agreements aud hand over gratis to the local Soviets all necessary means of production. Communists in short aim at forming a Communal possession ; the Liberals at forming a class of small peasant holders.JUGO-SLAVIA.The Elections.The elections in Jugo-Slavia early in the month have left no party with a majority, a condition of affairs Avhich will probably result in recurrent intrigues aud crises. Even if the Democrats and Radicals accept a working agreement some other party will have to be brougnt in to procure an absolute majority. The collapse of the Croat Union Party and the Clerical Party is noteworthy. The most striking result is the success of the Radio Peasant Party. Radio, who was serving a sentence of 2\ years for treason, was released shortly before the elections, and his party obtained 50 of the 93 seats iu Croatia.At a mass meeting in Zagreb representatives of 450,000 voters of the Peasant Party decided that the Radic deputies should abstain from attending the Constituent Assembly at Belgrade. A Croatian Peasant Republic was then proclaimed and the oath of allegiance taken to a species of Constitution. The apparent aim of the Croats is something analogous to M. Stambuliski&apos;s &quot;Green&quot; International, and they are understood to have made it clear that Bulgaria is in this regard their spiritual home. If other Constituent States of Jugo-Slavia do not become Republics they proclaim their intention of proceeding alone. Their action does not appear to have greatly disturbed the authorities, and Hie Constituent Assembly will, if necessary, proceed without Radic and his deputies. It is unlikely that Serbs interspersed among the Croats will be in a position to resist.
Fear of the &quot; Green &quot; International is reported to be driving local Communists into association with the Monarchists. The secret treaty said to have been concluded between Italy and Jugo-Slavia as an annexe of tho Treaty of liapallo is reported to provide especially for common action in the caso of a return of the Hapsburg dynasty to Budapest, an eventuality dreaded by both countries, It is not clear in what way it envisages any action on Pan-German lines on the part of the Hungarian group with which Italy, in her support of a North German Monarchist renaissaucc, would bo more in sympathy.Details of tho recently discovered plot on tho part of the jugo-Slav Communists in Belgrade have not yet been received. Documents seized are said to show that the assassination of tho ex-Premier Vesnic and tho Ministers of Foreign Affairs and of Agriculture had been planned, and that a largo number of Ministers and prominent politicians were to be arrested.   Severe measures of repression have been taken.Dr. Accurli, tho Public Prosecutor in the Agram high treason trial of 1908, and his wife have been arrested on charges of dealings with tho Hapsburgs and Hungarians. Other prominent people are said to be accomplices and further arrests are anticipated.BULGARIA.The event of the month in Bulgaria has been the visit of M. Slambuliski to his Polish colleague M. Witos. By this visit M. Stambuliski extends his negotiations for the construction of a &quot; green &quot; or peasant international beyond his immediate neighbours. The purpose of the &quot; Green&quot; Inter-national, Avhich has in substance been to some extent anticipated in the rural Catholic countries of Central Europe, is the defence of the rights of small agricultural proprietors against Bolshevism, on the one hand, and re-actionary tendencies on the other. The scheme which M. Stambuliski is believed to be propounding includes an entente between the peasant organisations of all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, a region, after all, pre-eminently rural, the inhabitants of which are peasants who until quite recently have lived in almost feudal conditions.In Bulgaria itself the peasants are still reported on the whole to be satisfied with the Government, which is now discouraging tho tendency of the younger generation virtually to denationalise themselves by adopting professional careers, and is above all limiting the number of law students.The Communist movement, especially in the provinces, has been helped by the defeat of Wrangel. Lenin is reported to have an agent in Sofia, a Bulgarian subject of Jewish extraction, passing under the alias of Sborovsky, to whom money is sent, principally from Frederick Strom in Stockholm and Kopp in Berlin.In the villages this man&apos;s agents are reported to be working with little success. He is now directing his efforts to the permeation of the army, the overwhelming majority of whose rank and file, however, being of peasant stock, is likely to remain equally impervious to his influences. The village schools are reported to be the centres from which Communist doctrines have the most chance of radiating, and most of the teachers, persons educated, up to a point, in Western fashion, and excessively badly paid, are undisguised communists. Steps, it is understood, are being taken by the Government to have these wiped out by local plebiscite.
In tho towns matters appear not to be going quite so well. Tho arrival of Bolsheviks among the refugees from the Crimea is having considerable influence among the townsfolk, though the motives of many converts are reported to be selfish or precautionary.An Anarchist apache group led by a certain Gucrjikoff, while thrilling Southern Bulgaria with its exploits, is thought to have little political significance. A movement, known as that of the Christian or While Communists, now seeking to establish itself in Sofia, may bo a Bolshevik-scheme to capture the religious-minded.Secessions have reduced the deputies of the Broad Socialist Parlia-mentary group to six. On a referendum only 12 out of 152 organisations and groups voted for the adoption of the basis of the Third International.ROUMANIA.The Bolshevik cloud hangs upon tho Bessarabian border. The rural population in Bessarabia, which has for some time been subjected to Communist propaganda, is greatly disturbed. Before the ice of the Dniester bore the Roumanians feared that the Bolsheviks might cross the river by night, and, in any case, the river is easily passable at any point during the winter. The smoothness with Avhich the Riga Peace pour-parlers have been developing appeared rather to confirm the intention of the Soviet to smooth matters down with Poland while concentrating at leisure against Roumania. Negotiation with the neighbours of an intended victim is a favourite device of Bolshevik diplomacy and strategy. M. Tchitcberin&apos;s reply to M. Take Jonescu&apos;s recent note is usnatisfactory in that it mentions the danger of conflict without doing anything to remove it.The occupation by the Hungarian troops of the neutral zone, con-trary to the decisions of the inter-Allied Commission, appears to constitute a further grave difficulty for the Roumanian Government. Its interpretation must vary in accordance with which of the two reactionary parties in Hungary has the upper hand for the moment. If it is the doing of the Pan-German Five, the situation of Roumania would appear to be parlous.In November the Roumanian Government informed Tchitcherin and Rakowski that tho union of Bessarabia to Roumania was a question definitely settled by the Bessarabians themselves and by its recognition by the Great Powers. Roumania was prepared to discuss peace with Russia when Moscow had specified the points in dispute betAveen the tAvo countries.Moscoav, meanwhile, held out for the &quot; independence&quot; of Bessarabia, but &quot;independence&quot; of Russia, as small and Aveak States upon her borders quickly learn, very shortly means the creation of a legislature parallel to that of Moscoav and acting uuder its direction.The application of Roumanian agrarian htAVS to Bessarabia is said to haAre caused dissatisfaction. The lands expropriated Avere to be paid for in bonds, but payment has not been made and formerly wealthy families have been reduced to beggary. The intended unification of the laAV of expropriation, making the maximum holding of land 100 hectats, in Roumania as in Bessarabia will probably cause discontent. The lack in some districts of peasants to whom the expropriated land would be distributed has resulted in large concessions to limited liability Companies.In the towns congestion has forced the Roumanian Government to order the forcible letting of surplus rooms in all houses, so that no family
may have more than two rooms plus a bedroom for each member of the family. Permis dc sejour for foreigners in Iho larger towns arc for 15 days only, and not renewable unless the necessity of continued residence is proved.All the leaders of the Socialist Party and those chiefly implicated in the forming of tho recent general strike are being tried by court-martial. The defence called the principal Ministers for cross-examination, when General Avarescu found it difficult to explain tho stringent measures he had taken. Short periods of imprisonment are probable for the Socialist leaders concerned, but it is thought that their prestige will not have lost in the process.6. NEAR EASTERN STATES. TURKEY.The Nationalists, the Bolsheviks, the Entente and Germany.kt a Cabinet Council held in Constantinople on November 22nd it was reported that the National forces had been much encouraged by the fall of the Venizelists, the defeat of Wrangel, and the successes in Armenia. An envoy bearing a letter from Mustapha Kemal is said to have reported that if the Entente Powers favoured Turkish claims based upon Wilsonian principles, the Nationalist chiefs were prepared to remove difficulties in which the effective application of the treaty would involve the Powers.Though the treaty between the Soviet Government and Kemal Pasha has enhanced Soviet prestige among the Mohamedans, suspicions of Kemal&apos;s treason and trouble with the anti-Bolshevik population of Azerbaijan are causing coolness between Kemal and the Bolsheviks. Kemal distrusts the latter enough to keep all of their kidney out of Anatolia while displaying an insatiable appetite for their gold. Bolshevik envoys watch him jealously in case he should enter into regular relations with the British. Moscow will have nothing to say to KemaPs demand for recognition of the Russian Moslem States and the guarantee of an alliance with Turkey. Since Wrangel&apos;s fall Russia also fears a secret accommodation between the Turks and the Allies. Niliad Reshad advocates support of the Allies if they restore Thrace and Smyrna and leave Kemal alone in the East, in which case Nihad would sever his Indian connections. Kemafs instructions are that the Greeks are to be attacked at all times, the British only on provocation.Reports of a rift in the alliance between the Bolsheviks and the Nationalists may, in effect, be interpreted as bints to tho Allies to modify the Treaty of Sevres. The purpose of the Bolsheviks is said by Mustapha Kemal to be his own dismissal from the head of the Nationalists in favour of Enver Pasha, a step which would revive the rule of the Committee of Union and Progress. This, along with Bolshevik anxiety to impose their regime upon Anatolia, is the main reason for Mustapha Kemal&apos;s recently expressed willingness to co-operate with the Central Turkish Government. With regard to Smyrna and Thrace, however, he maintains his position.Reported utterances from Berlin of Talaat Pasha, a member of the Committee of Union and Progress, are strangely consonant with the new trend of Mustapha Kemal&apos;s policy. Talaat declared that he had no fear of Bolshevik propaganda among Mohamedans, which the Moslem mentality and the Koran alike doomed to failure.   He advocated support
of the Moluimodiin republics bordering on Russia as a natural barrief protecting Europe against Bolshevism and Russian influence. The support of Mobamedans living in Russia could be counted on, and the permission to organise their territories was a weapon which Enver would, use more readily against Moscow than with it. Talaat was at one with Kemal in considering that the Treaty of Sevres drove the Turkish Nationalists into tiie arms of the Bolsheviks. He urged reconciliation with Great Britain as the way to order, peace, and trade between Mesopotamia, Turkestan, and the Caucasus, and suggested an amnesty to the leaders and political prisoners at Malta, the transformation of the vilayet of Smyrna into a free state on the lines of Danzig, and the retention of some Turkish influence north of Alexaudretta-Mosul. As for the oilfields, Turkey was not an industrial country, and did not want them. Talaat said lie found the Entente Foreign Offices had a much better understanding of Near Eastern problems than tho Wilhehnstrasse. He was indignant with a leading German politician who asked him to dine with certain alleged Turks, really Constantinople Jews.Talaat is constantly in touch with Enver at Moscow, in dealing with which he has, however, more scruples. It appears that both, either by embarrassment or persuasion, are trying to bring Great Britain to an amnesty and concessions.Bolshevik Organisation in Constantinople and Anatolia.The Bolshevik convergence upon Constantinople following Wrangel&apos;s defeat has disclosed widespread, and, it is said, successful propaganda among Crimean army refugees. The Bolshevik organisation in Constanti-nople is believed to have centres at Beikos, Scutari, and Stamboul, to be well financed, and to have Turkish as well as Russian branches. The pro-paganda section lias even produced 20,000 English leaflets for the Allied forces. The Committee is thought to have plenty of mouey aud an efficient intelligence service.The Nationalists in Anatolia have lately appointed &quot; Independent Tribunals &quot; with wide powers, imitated from the Bolshevik Chresvichaikha. These tribunals administer summary jurisdiction in military offences ; their decisions are final. A proclamation by the Trebizond tribunal states that they have been formed to deal with traitors.Labour and Socialists.Christian workers in Turkey have, during the last 10 years, made some progress iu the organisation of labour on western lines. Though the organisation is embryonic, solidarity increases. Turkish workmen, however, are generally apathetic.The two Turkish Socialist Parties (the Turkish Socialist Party and the Turkish Agricultural Labourers&apos; Union) have for leaders men of the Effendi, most of whom are, or have been, schoolmasters. The Socialists, who do little publicly, have had some success among the small Turkish guilds and the workmen in Government factories. Their propaganda has been more effective among workmen in private factories, but the party&apos;s share in the most important strike since the Armistice, that of tramway and tunnel employees, was negligible. The dissensions between Moslems and Christians seem to render improbable any successful combined move-ment of labour against capital.PERSIA.The Persian Government, which is now represented at Moscow, but has not yet received a Soviet ambassador, has been endeavouring to
arrange a modus Vivendi with the Russians, but has been considerably perturbed by threatened Bolshevik aggression through the Republic of Azerbaijan and from Khorassan, as well as by Bolshevik intervention on behalf of the Persian Communist Party, against which the Persian Government has been taking measures.The modus vivendi is embodied in a draft treaty negotiated by the Persian representative in Moscow in consultation with Tehran. The draft is reported to consist of an open and a secret agreement. Openly the Russians revoke all agreements between old Russia and Persia, and cancel those concerning Persia between old Russia and other nations. Soviet Russia, while cancelling Persian debts to Russia, undertakes not to interfere in any locality where these debts were incurred. Persia is made trustee for Shushter, Enzeli, Teheran, Kasvin, and Hamadam, and their dependencies, hitherto under Russian influence, for Russian tele-graph lines in Persia, for the Port of Enzeli and its dependencies. Russia will vacate all Russian administrations in-Persia, and hand over their buildings for use as national dependencies.Rights of navigation in the Caspian are held in common. Persia undertakes not to alienate concessions in land, property, &amp;c, enjoyed by Old Russia. Subjects of both States will be subject to local laws, while in each other&apos;s territory. Diplomatic relations and representatives will be re-established. Tho secret clauses provide against attack on Russia via. Persia. Russia can in case of such au attack send troops into Persia and undertakes to oppose troops threatening Persia from Azerbaijan and Armenia. The post at Enzeli will remain under Russian guard &quot; so long as Russian troops are compelled to remain in Enzeli.&quot; This occupation is officially noted as a consequence of foreign threats by the Caucasus, and it is undertaken that as soon as this menace is removed, Russia will evacuate Persia.The secret agreement is understood to contain a clause stating that Persia will support and permit Socialists and Peasant Guilds, and, if necessary, pass laws in their favour, and will grant a public pardon to persons concerned in the Gilan revolution, and the formation of a Communist State there. Russia undertakes to appoint a Commission from both sides to assess damage in Gilan. It is provided that in all towns possessing a bank, where there is no Russian Consulate, one of the banks will be allotted for a Russian Consulate.The Persian authorities in favour of the draft treaty say that as Russia is now free from internal and external pressure, Persia, if the agreement is not signed, will be open to invasion from all sides, whether from Azerbaijan or Khorassan. They contend that the British vvi 11 not offer opposition, and that even should they do so and enable Persia to resist victoriously, Persia will have fallen from the frying pan into the lire.   On these grounds they consider it advisable to sign.Influential opponents in Persia are reported to object that while the Persian Minister in Moscoav is endeavouring to secure the withdrawal of the Soviet Army the Republic of Azerbaijan (which for these purposes may bo considered an instrument of Moscow), contrary to promises given, is sending troops to Enzeli, and has sent 500,000 men to Resht, a difficulty which it is contended precludes the Persian Government from proceeding with the agreement.It is believed that the Persian Government lias no objection in principle to receiving a Russian ambassador at Tehran. Regarding the stipulation by M. Tchitcherin that the Persian Communist Party should not be prosecuted by the Persian Government, its attitude, however, is reported to be less compliant, and the high authorities in Persia contend that M. Tchitcherin&apos;s desire is not consonant with the stipulation that
neither State should interfere in the internal affairs of the other. The Persian Government is reported to find difficulty in reconciling any promise on its part of freedom of action on the part of the Communist Party, since the fundamental principles of that party are opposed to the Persian constitution. It is probable that a pardon to Persian Communists will be made conditional upon a promise by the Soviet Government that it will support them in none of their future misdeeds.The Avholo discussion, however, is regarded as subject by the Persian Government to the withdrawal of the Soviet Army. The advance of the Turkish Army in Armenia, the overthrow of that State, the proximity of the Republic of Azerbaijan to the north-Avest frontier, aro regarded as a definitely threatening combination.The Persians, it is said, have information that the Bolsheviks intend, for economic reasons, to attack Khorassan. As tho Persian authorities have been encouraging to the utmost of their power the transport of supplies and other necessaries to Soviet Russia from Khorassan, they believe that the reason of the proposed aggression cannot be really economic and feel corresponding anxiety regarding the reports it has obtained. The Persian Government on the other hand is reported to have been making overtures to Moscow for the restoration to Persia of the province of Nakhichevan, Avhich it claims as an ancient Persian possession. A so-called Persian Delegation which arrived at Baku on December 18th, and was met by the Azerbaijan Revolutionary Com-mittee and the staff of the 11th Army, has been disavowed by the Persian Foreign Office. It is hinted that this so-called delegation, then on tho point of leaving for Moscow, Avas neither more nor less than a put-up job between Soviet Russia and the group of Persian Communists.EGYPT.The past month has been marked by the groAving influence of the Moderates in Egypt, accompanied by some uneasiness among the Zaghloulites. Adli Pasha Yeghen and his friends are believed to be organising a party avIiosc real, if unavoAved, policy, will be to accept a more limited form of independence even than that Avhich Zaghloul declined to consider in London. In formulating his policy,however, Yeghen Pasha is bound to give weight to the opposition of the extremists. The returned members of the Egyptian Delegation intend to oppose the formation of all Cabinets until the British Government has promised to abolish the Protectorate, and it is probable that Yeghen Pasha would have to draAV up a programme considerably in advance of what he would be disposed to accept. Any plenipotentiaries Avhich the delegation might deem unrepresentative of the Egyptian people would be violently opposed by them and by all other extremists, a fact which sufficiently accounts for Adli Yeghen&apos;s hesitation to take any definite step. *The preface to the recent revised edition of Lord Milner&apos;s book is reported to have created a good impression and to be tending to allay some of the childish suspicion Avhich clouds the understanding of all or most of the political negotiators.An eminent Syrian, recently discussing the Egyptian question in the house of a Aveaithy felloAV-countrymau, said, in conversation which Avas general, that had the English annexed the country instead of declaring the Protectorate, there would have been no trouble. The company present finally agreed that the only policy now possible Avas that of granting the limited independence to Egypt which is uoav in the air, although Syrians and educated Levantines generally would prefer the complete annexation of the country to the uncertainty of the prospect uoav before them.
Sonic of the energy lias undoubtedly been taken out of the agitation by the slump in cotton prices. The recent record crops greatly inflated rents so that a good deal of land is now rented at six times its real value. Readjustment is an urgent necessity. The peasantry are reported now to realise that they gained nothing and suffered much from the spring revolution. The extremists no longer find them so easy to handle. It is unlikely that the fellahesn would support any political movement by violence. The cost of living, the cotton slump, and above all, the conviction that the troubles of (he spring of 1918, into which they were led by reckless agitators, were a big blunder for which they have had to pay, lias made them less inclined to react. The agrarian difficulty, moreover, has made landowners nervous, and, consequently, less sanguine as to the future, should British guidance cease or be seriously enfeebled on the banks of the Nile.A feature of the situation is the recrudescence of the Turkish element in Egyptian politics. ZaghlouL to some extent, is regarded by the Egyptians much as they regarded Arabi 38 years ago, as a man of real Egyptian blood and a sincere patriot, a sentiment to which must be attributed the popular support which constitutes his political importance. There are indications, however, that his part has been already played. He and his delegation have advanced the solution of the Egyptian question to a very great extent. By retiring now they would certainly have deserved well of their countrymeD. Egyptians in Cairo are reported to be more tractable than the rabid young Europeanised Orientals who surrounded Zaghloul Pasha in Paris and London.Adli Yeghen, Sarwat, Rushdi, and the other Pashas all represent the adroiter and more intelligent Turkish administrators who, since the time of the Mamelukes to tho British Occupation, have governed the country to its sorrow and undoing. It is at least likely that whatever form of government may follow the treaty, the Pashas of Turkish, Albanian, and Circassian descent arc destined to hold the power as before. The tragedy is that in Egypt this semi-alien class alone is endowed with political intelligence. Unfortunately, it despises the fellah from its heart, and is probably still as ready to exploit him as ever.The abolition of the capitulations is in the air once more. It is generally thought that though the French may accept it, the Italians and Greeks arc very strongly opposed to abolition. The Italians in Cairo, never too friendly to the British regime, are said to be boasting that they will do their utmost to prevent the government from coming to an understanding with the British on this delicate problem.Tt is reported that the Egyptian Committee, which manages the dispatch of arms from Italy to Egypt, will in future use Greek ports instead of Italian.An American trade &quot; push,&quot; veiling itself under propagandist zeal for education, is said to be apparent.The Jesuits in Egypt are lecturing lucidly and convincingly on Bolshevism, Socialism, Agnosticism, and other pressing problems.7. CENTRAL ASIATIC STATES.THE CAUCASUS.The condition of the Caucasus is reported to be extremely disturbed. Anti-Bolshevik feeling is said to be growing, especially in Daghestan, where Turkish agitation prospers and risings still occur. Risings against the Soviet, minimised by the Bolsheviks as the work of the &quot; White and
Green Robber Bunds,&quot; are continuous, but are rendered fruitless by the dissensions among the tribes and tho lack of a capable individual leader. None of the individual anti-Bolshevik organisations is strong enough to shake the Rods effectively. Much of the trouble is due to the Gortai, or hill tribes, of Daghestan, who stand for half a dozen conflicting methods of government. Now that Wrangel has collapsed, any inune-diate general rising appears to be impossible. Only from the Turks could a general movement strong enough to oust the Bolsheviks spring. The cost of living mounts daily, and many people are half starving. Bribery, corruption, and speculation have reached fantastic heights. The mobilisation of all officers and civilians up to the age of 45, proclaimed by the Bolsheviks, had to be abandoned. This was largely due to the Cossacks, who insisted on having their own regiments, and refused to be distributed amongst the ranks of the Red Army.The Bolsheviks, nevertheless, remain firmly established. Tho individuals in power are mostly men of the lowest classes and of the worst type. Their regime is what might be expected a compound of brutality, terror, bribery, and espionage. As in Russia, propaganda seeks to fill the people with hatred of the French, and, more particularly, of the British, so in the East it seeks to arouse similar hatred among the Moslems. The Bolsheviks have succeeded in creating a strong feeling against the British, even among the anti-Bolsheviks, who accuse the latter of playing a double game.Evidence accumulates that the Bolsheviks fear the danger threaten-ing them from the Mohanietlan movement. This fear inspires such activities as the Baku Congress, the anti-British propaganda, and the proclamations of Bolshevik championship of Islam. Turkey has not abandoned her claim to the vilayets of Ears, Ardahan, and Batum  hence her advance against Armenia. This advance the Bolsheviks wish genuinely to check, feeling their imminent peril should the Turks reach the Azerbaijan frontier. Moslem feeling in the North Caucasus and Trans-Caucasia, with their Moslem population cf 4^ millions, is inflamed by Bolshevik horrors and massacres, and is now a desire for vengeance. An external impulse might raise the country from the Black Sea to the Caspian and on to Turkestan.The arrival of a Turkish Delegation at Tiflis on November 13th w.*,s followed by a change of government, M. Chekheugeli, chief of the moderate Social Democratic Party, becoming Premier. It was once supposed that the Nationalists favoured military measures to ensure the success of their schemes in the Batum area, but they would now appear to be following more devious ways, probably as a result of Bolshevik pressure.Tcliitcherin has sent a note to Kemal which declares that the terms of the Brest-Litovsk treaty will no longer be considered binding as between Soviet Russia and Nationalist Turkey, and calls for an immediate withdrawal of Turkish troops beyond the River Arpechai, and the cessation of hostilities against the Armenian Republic, the independence and integrity of which has been recognised by Soviet Russia.ARMENIA.Peace between the Turks and Armenians was actually signed at Alexandropol on December 5th. The Bolsheviks had been actively organising a coup cVetat for some weeks past, and commenced to act immediately after the signing of peace. Soviet detachments under the command of a Russian Bolshevik named Silin advanced into Armenia
from tho north, and their arrival was the signal for the proclamation of a Soviet in each of the larger towns, including Erivau. Revolutionary committees were established, and Armenia was proclaimed an Independent Soviet Republic, In its earlier stages tho movement appears to have been accomplished without conflict or bloodshed, and the situation is similar to that in Baku at the end of April last.The Armenian Revolutionary Committee arrived by train from Baku, and included as President, Kassian, and as members Moravian, G-abrolian, and others. On arrival the new authorities observed the usual procedure and immediately issued an order forbidding all officials to leave their posts &quot; until the arrival of Soviet officials from Russia.&quot; The latter will, of course, include the inevitable &quot; Ohrozvychaika &quot; and the other usual Bolshevik institutions. A part of the Dashnaks under General Dro apparently sided with the Bolsheviks, and Dro was temporarily placed in command of the Armenian forces. The districts of Nakhichevan and Zangezur have been incorporated in Armenian territory, and ys such will enjoy just as much independence as that enjoyed by the &quot; Independent Azerbaijan Republic.&quot; The attitude of the Turks was distrustful, and by the Bolsheviks, distrusted.Following the proclamation of the- Soviet, Kiazim Kara Bekir is said to havo sent a telegram of congratulations to the new government, declaring that there could be no further cause for hostilities between the Turks and Armenians since the two peoples were now as brothers. There are indications that the Bolsheviks, while taking these declaration-tious at their face value, regarded their author and his countrymen as unreliable.Apart from the difficulty of maintaining his forces in the Karo high-lands, the fact of Kiazim Kara Bekir having been thwarted in the continuation of a campaign in which his own personal aims were prominently concerned, will scarcely tend to increase his friendship with the Bolsheviks.The opinion is held by many people that the establishment of a Soviet Government in Armenia must shortly be followed by a similar event&apos; in Georgia. The Bolsheviks acted with promptness and decision in ArmenL so soon as it became a question of forestalling the Turks. They will, in all probability, act with equal promptness again, should the Turks continue to betray designs on the Batum province.AZERBAIJAN.The working classes in Azerbaijan are stated to be thoroughly dis-illusioued and dissatisfied since the proclamation of the Republic. Nationalisation has killed the fisheries and stopped production iu the factories and large industries, from which workmen are flocking to the Kuban and Georgia.The Russians have succeeded iu completely alienating the Moslem population ; should the Turkish Army occupy Azerbaijan the Moslem population would rise en masse. The Governments only means of preventing an upheaval is terrorism, constantly intensified. For the present the Bolsheviks are too strong to be overthrown. The Army has little stomach for fighting, and sailors, who enjoy special privileges, are the backbone of the Republic.A lingual concession has been made in the schools. Originally the Bolsheviks tried to suppress all languages but Russian. Now in the first grade schools the instruction is iu the native language of the child. Russian and Tartar are obligatory in the second grade.
GEORGIA.Trouble in neighbouring States has led the Georgian Government to order the mobilisation of four classes. It was reported in November that the Bolsheviks, having concluded that immediate military action in Georgia was impossible, wero developing their propaganda and their organisation in the Bat urn region, on which they were prepared to spend 35 million roubles in old Russian money. Active though the Georgian [ntelligeuce was, it was not strong enough for effective counter work, A section of Greek Communists, dependent upon headquarters in Constantinople, was reported to exist in Baluni.Apart, from the arrival in Georgia of an official German representative, since the departure of the British troops from Transcausia and the arrival of the Kiroif Mission in Tiflis, German agents have become more active and are now said lo be visibly working in close touch with tho Bolshevik representatives.The Belgian Government have sent M. Leon do Barsy, of the Belgian Ministry of Finance, to Georgia, as financial adviser to the Government.8. FAR EASTERN STATES. JAPAN.The first Census returns of the population of the Japanese Empire on October 1st of last year are 77,005,510.Japan proper       -      -    - -      - 55,961,14.0Korea...... 17,284,207Formosa      -      -      -      -      - 3,654,398Saghalien     ----- 105,765These figures are less by tone million than the estimated population of 1918 ; the decrease is due not to actual loss, but to the inaccuracy of the former method of census taking. Males in Japan proper are 124,850 more than females, the former numbering ,28,042,995 and the latter 27,918,154.The populations of some of the larger cities are as follows : Tokio...... 2,173,162Osaka...... 1,252,972Kobe...... 608,628Kyoto    -      -      -   . -     -      - 591,305Nagoya...... 429,990Yokohama     -      -     -     -      - 422,942SIBERIA.It is reported that the Far Eastern State is being used as a blind for Communism. The Bolsheviks are working for the dissolution of the local &apos; assembly in Vladivostock, an event which might cause a reactionary coup d&apos;etat, resulting probably in the formation of two buffer states,, in commercial contact, but under separate political control. &quot;The farcical elections of the Constituent Assembly will probably secure a Bolshevik majority. The Bolsheviks live in terror of;.a revolutionary democratic coup d&apos;etat, which only refusal of their sanction by the Japanese prevents. The latter are, however, secretly encouraging the work of the organisation.o   AS 8592 E
The dissatisfaction of the peasantry has found vent in a number of risings which have been barbarously suppressed. The remnants of the rebels, some -15,000 badly armed men, are said to remain at Taiga. The Peasants&apos; Union and the Mussulmans are organising against the Bolsheviks.The population of Kamchatka and of the Tchukolzky Peninsula is about 40,000 of different races. Tho Japanese possess most of the fisheries, tho Chinese are traders, and the Americans do a large business. Trade is chiefly conducted by barter ; gold and silver are accepted, but paper money, whatever its origin, is refused.CHINA.The Anarchist and Socialist movement in China, encouraged though it has been by events in Russia, does not seem to have any direct connection with Russian Bolshevism. The source of both may be similar, but Chinese anarchism is not an out-growth of Russian Bol-bolshevism. Chinese unrest however affords anarchism a very fertile field. Its adherents are chiefly in the ports, and the peasantry, the great bulk of the population, arc quite unaffected. The main development appears likely to lie syndicalism and labour unrest, chiefly affecting foreigners who do business in the Treaty Ports. There appear to be connections between Chinese anarchist papera and anarchist papers in London.A delegation from the so-called Far Eastern Republic, headed by M. Vourin, was in Peking in October ostensibly on a purely commercial mission. Other influences of the same kind have apparently been at work, for the Peking Government have cancelled recognition of the Russian Legation and the Russian Consulate in China, on the ground that they do not represent any existing regime. Bolsheviks regard this as a step towards getting their own legations.Lizcrovitch was then also in Peking. He is reported to have been instructed by Sylvia Pankhurst to tell the Chinese that the whole of the Socialist Party is in sympathy with them, but that thoy must also help themselves. He further informed some prominent Koreans that only-Soviet Russia could help them against Japan. They must show their good faith by anti-British propaganda, and they would not be forgotten.It is reliably reported that a man named Voitiusky was recently sent from here to Shanghai on press propaganda work for the Communist Party. He is a Communist, educated in. U.S.A., and speaks perfect English. His headquarters are in the office of the Zakoubsbit in Shanghai. The Bolsheviks are using Berlitz school teachers of the Russian language as propaganda agents amongst the Chinese students. Orjeschko is now working with Jurin in Peking.The new Minister for Foreign Affairs is Dr. Yen, an Auglophobo Chinaman. He speaks excellent German, and was Chinese Minister to Berlin until China joined the Allies. Germans are returning to China in large numbers. One who was five years in a prison camp in Japan has, with other prisoners, been engaged by the Japanese to get aniline dyes from Germany for Japanese firms. \9. BRITISH COLONIES. CANADA.Extremists.Unemployment is not only growing rapidly, but is assuming an air of menace.   Destitution has begun, and there are threats of recourse to
violence, of which returned soldiers who have been unable to obtain work are talking openly. The One Big Union is reported to be working hand in hand with tho Communist Party. Fortunately the extremists are disorganised and quarelling among themselves. The Ono Big Union is becoming more and more discredited, especially in the lumber camps, &quot;where the loggers are reported to realise that it is not, and has never been, of much use to them. In British Columbia there is at present little indication of strikes or unrest. Many loggers are drifting back to the United States, and tho men have accepted a reduction iu wages, aud appear glad to take work of any sort.The Lumber Camps.Employers in these camps arc taking a stand against agitators. In some camps they have warned the men that neither meetings nor delegates would be allowed. It is reported that the only reading matter which appears to reach the men in the camps is of a revolutionary nature. At a logging camp, whose owner refused to allow delegates, meetings, or Bolshevik literature, and said he would dismiss agitators, the men reinon-strafed and struck, but the strike only lasted three days, and tho delegation of three which conveyed the remonstrance to tho owner was discharged without incident.The companies appear to have organised an efficient system for keeping track of undesirables, who find it difficult to get situations. Unfortunately the fear of unemployment is getting on the nerves of the men. There is a wild scramble for jobs, a state of affairs in which the foreign element is prone to talk of violence.The Coalfields.In the coalfields foreign-speaking malcontents are foremost in every trouble or disturbance, and arc indignant at the apathy of English-speaking workers, Avhom they denounce as traitors to the cause. In the Alberta coalfields the strike came to an inglorious end, and the employers have found themselves strong enough to blacklist and drive from the district a number of conspicuous agitators. The strike, though led with exceptional uuscrupuiousness, was, on the whole, badly managed. A district secretary of the One Big Union has let himself in for prosecution for spreading false news in order to foment it.Tn the Nova Scotia coalfields the mood of the men is aggressive and turbulent, and their leaders have lost control of the situation. The findings of the Eoyal Commission lately appointed by the Dominion Government have been scouted where they did not suit them. A trial of strength appears inevitable, and the steel companies are beginning to shut down in anticipation of trouble.Unemployment.The Federal Government has decided, in order to provide employment, to continue such public works as shipbuilding and the Welland Canal, and will contribute one-third of the amouut actually expended by local authorities in unemployment relief, but it is improbable that the demand for a system of unemployment insurance will be granted. One of the, suggestions made by the Federated Labour Party for providing work for the unemployed is that the Government should establish State-owned factories and workshops, in which persons out of work could be engaged iu productive labour.Much of the unemployment which prevails among women is said to be caused through the influx of factory girls from Britain who obtained 0  as 8592 f
entry into Canada by posing as domestic servants, and are now looking for factory work. A large number of women are out of employment partly through tho competition of Japanese women, who underbid while women.The Railway Dispute.A small strike on a railway owned by tho Dominion Steel Corporation has led to what is virtually a challenge by the Canadian Labour Unions to the Government. The origin of the trouble was caused by a section of the employees in the Maritime Provinces, who threatened to place an embargo on freight connected with the Dominion Iron and Steel or the Nova Scctia Steel and Coal Companies, unless the strike was settled to thoir satisfaction. Another point at issue is the recent order forbidding employees on the Government system to run for any political oilices, and the dismissal of certain Government railway employees who neglected it. The Union forces challenged the decision and applied to tho Government Board of Conciliation to settle the dispute, tho existence of which the management, while declining to participate in the Conciliation Board, refused to recognise. The disputo has raised the whole question of the control of the railways, regarding which some settlement will have to be arrived at between the Canadian Government and the Unions.The Socialist Party.The excessive independence of the Socialist Party of Canada, which refuses to consider itself as in communion with any other body, has created some ill-feeling between it and the Federated Labour Party and other revolutionary organisations. Moderates are endeavouring to com-pose the quarrel, and the Federated Labour Party at present appear averse from lifting the gauntlet thrown down by the Socialist Party.Miscellaneous.The Self-Determination for Ireland League is attracting Extremists from all parts of the Dominion into its ranks.The British Empire Union, started at the extremities of the country to oppose both Bolshevism and Sinn Fein, has made a promising beginning.SOUTH AFRICA.Nationalist policy continues dangerous ; it keeps the question of secession constantly before the people, and would, if carried out, only result in a complete disruption of the Union of South Africa and a return to the old system of separate rival States. The indefinite postponement of the secession issue by the Transvaal Nationalist Party appears, however, to have greatly perturbed Nationalist ranks.In emulation of revolutionary socialists in other countries the Industrial Socialist League in Cape Town has determined to call itself Communist. Its new constitution will include adherence to the Third Internationa], mass action and abstention from Parliamentary action, the Soviet system and Proletarian dictatorship.White labour agitation is described as having an unfortunate effect on the native mind, and the authorities are carefully watching certain coloured agitators who are fostering discord between the white population and the natives. A native detective recently sent to the late Chief Bambata&apos;s Location to arrest two natives for theft found them armed.A secret society, called &quot; The African Blood Brotherhood,&quot; is reported to have several thousand members, and 50 branches in secret operation
throughout Africa, the West Indies, and other parts of the Kthiopic world.AUSTRALIA, Strike of Marine Stewards. ,The industrial outlook has been seriously affected by the shortage of coal and tho threatened general stoppage of work due to the Marine Stewards&apos; strike, which it was feared might cut Tasmania off from the mainland for the third Christmas in succession. Sailings for San Francisco have had to be cancelled until February. The Stewards have asked for, a conference of the shipowners, who refuso to discuss terms until the strikers resume work. Coastal, inter-State, and inter-island steamers are idle. Early in January 1921 the seamen were becoming restive, and declaring that unless tho stewards return they would go to sea without them.On the Western Australia railways all railway traffic ceased at the end of the month. The employees demand a seven-hour day with 50 per cent, differentiation in pay between day and night work. The President of the Labour Party has undertaken that the Disputes Com-mittee will run such trains as are absolutely necessary to prevent starvation-tion. The strikers, before deserting their trains, watered, cleaned, and coaled them at the depots.The enthusiasm of many local priests and Sinn Feiners has been damped by the public statement of Archbishop Kelly, of Sydney, on his return from a long visit to England and Rome. This declaration was to the effect that Dominiou Home Rule and independence within the Empire was the solution of the Irish problem.NEW ZEALAND.Industrial unrest in the autumn evinced itself iu a series of strikes and &quot; go-slows &quot; in coal mines and in a.hold up for one week on the Welling-ton wharves. The train-running staff of the Railway Department also showed signs of restlessness. The causes of dispute are described as many and varied and the tactics of the insurrectionary bodies were regarded as so many pin pricks to test the temper of the Government prior to the general strike of all miners and transport workers which was considered inevitable. It is fair to the workers to add, however, that their tactics seem for the most part to have been determined by a militant minority.10. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Communist Activities.It is becoming increasingly evident that the Soviet Government of Russia controls the Extremists of Communist sympathies in the States, who, numbering about 500,000, have considerable influence with Radical adherents of other schools. The presence of an effective system of liaison between the two countries and an efficient underground organi-sation iu the States themselves enables Moscow to stabilise and spread its influences. The authorities of the Third International hope to increase their influence through Edward J. Co3tello, of the Federated Press, recently deported fi om England, who proposes to establish an inter-national news service to connect the Russian press with the outside world. A world convention of labour and radical editors is to be held in Brusselsf 2
next June for this purpose. Mr. Costello as a deportee from this country will in the first instance be refused a visa of England, and should he enter the United Kindom by illicit means will bo liable to six months&apos; imprisonment.Instructions have boon given to the Minister and American Consuls in Sweeden to refuse visas to naturalised American citizens of Russia origin coming from Russia until their names have been referred to Washington. Many such persons have left for Russian with passports issued by the Soviet authorities in Now York/aud the authorities fear that on their return they will engage in propaganda.The Deportation of Ludwig Martens.Ludwig Martens, the Soviet representative in the United States, will shortly be deported for advocating a Soviet programme to overthrow tho United States government, by force if necessary, lie will probably leave by the s.s. &quot; Stockholm &quot; on January 22nd and will take with him the whole of his staff, which numbers about 40. Before leaving he has been directed to cancel all contracts entered into with American firms, but it is believed that he will bequeath to one of these, regarding whose identity only surmise is at present possible, the interests of the Third International in America. To Martens&apos; threat, when tiie order for deportation was announced to him, that this expulsion by the American authorities would automatically cancel all agreements between the Soviet government and Mr. Vaudcrlip, the reply was given that only the crude materialism of the Soviet government could believe that America would consider commercial or industrial contracts, however good, where her own internal order was concerned. In a letter to the Attorney for Ludwig Martens the Secretary for Labour stated that there was cumulative and conclusive evidence that the military dictatorship of Russia was appro-priating large sums to disrupt the American government.The difficulties placed in the way of the Bolshevik representatives in America form the staple of a report to the Soviet government by Roustam Bek, who declares that despite the defeat of General Wrangei arrangements for the mobilisation of Russians living in the United States to reinforce the anti-Soviet troops are being continued. Bek reports that he and Martens had arranged to spend 200,000 dollars on propaganda amongst Reservists and in the local press against this mobilisation.Ban upon Bolshevik Gold.The purchase of Bolshevik gold has been banned by the United States. No gold arriving from Soviet Russia will be purchased by the United States mint, and all persons tendering gold to the mint are required to sign an affidavit to the effect that the gold has not emanated from Soviet Russia. The prohibition applies to all Russian gold reaching America directly or indirectly, even though it is obtained by legitimate trade. The ban is the consequence of the resolve of the American government not to deal with the Soviet government. Though there is no objection to the export of American gold to Russia the prohibition against the import of gold precludes all trade with that country.Roustam Bek, in the report before mentioned, reports that the prohibition has almost ruined any hope of paying for tho orders given to American factories, and it is reported that Soviet gold amounting to several millions of dollars is now lying idle in American banks, and in individual hands. Martens, however, has reported that it has been possible to realise certain categories of Russian securities since the fall of Wrangei, and the publication of the contracts made by Vanderlip, and
the United States Leather Company, of which Mr. McAdoo, former Minister of Finance in Washington, is tho president, is reported to havo arranged a contract in Russia, payment for which is to be made in Russian gold at Reval.Irish Activities.An American Committee for the Relief of Ireland has been formed byr a number of business men of Irish ancestry, with Cardinal Gibbons at its head. A preliminary fund of 3,000,000 dollars has been raised, of which a contribution of 25,000,000 dollars has been promised by the Friends of Irish Freedom. The refusal to vise the passports by the British Ambassador at Washington of the six men selected by the &quot; Com-mittec of 100&quot; to enquire into conditions in Ireland was generally approved. Miss Mary McSwiney&apos;s evidence for that Committee, far from assisting Sinn Fein, alienated the sympathies of many Americans.An American leaflet addressed to Longshoremen, Marine Firemen, Oilers aud Watertenders of the Atlantic Coast and vicinity, vilifying England and demanding the boycott of British ships, has been sent to England for circulation among seamen.Tom Mannix, an Irish agitator, has succeeded, in the face of the opposition of the United States Naturalisation Commission, iu obtaining the naturalisation of Bhagat Singh Thiud, au advocate of the principle of &quot; India for the Indians and freedom from British rule.&quot;German-American Anti-British Propaganda.The Stcuben Society, organised as a secret society during the last years of the Avar by American citizens of German descent to fight English propaganda and influence in the United States, has now been thrown open to German-American citizens generally, although its inner workings remain secret. It has formed an alliance with the Irish, but Irishmen are not eligible as members. Jeremiah 0&apos;Leary is shortly starting a German bi-monthly magazine, after the model of the &quot; Sinn Feiner,&quot; to fight English influences from the German standpoint. Until it is able to hold its own the paper will be financed by German capitalists. The Irish and the Germans are reported not to pull well together. The society has been joined by practically all the German Freemasons, and foreign speaking Masonic Lodges will also be invited to join, so as to make it a really strong anti-English organisation.The Coloured Races.The systematic and secret purchase by negroes in Georgia, U.S.A., of guns and ammunition is reported to have been engaging the attention of the authorities. Although, so far, it has not been possible to connect these purchases with the Socialist Party, it is apparent from the unnatural silence maintained about it that some Avell-organised plan has been laid down for the negro leaders.The National Association for the Advancement of the Coloured Peoples has protested to the Public Prosecutor against the activities of the recently revived &quot; Ku-Klux-Klan.&quot; This society, Avhich originated in the Southern States at the end of the Civil War, aims at the protec-tion of the Whites, and each member is pledged to maintain White supremacy in all phases of American life and to protect individual free-dom and American womanhood. It also works to maintain the absolute separation of Church and State.The finances of the Black Star Line aro reported to be exceedingly involved, and liquidation appears inevitable.
Socialists in Georgia claim 17,000 negro votes.It is reported in the London pi ess that owing to British advice J apail lias withdrawn her objections to the Califorhian law prohibiting Japanese subjects from holding land.11. CENTRAL AMERICAN STATES. MEXICO.Martens, the Soviet representative in America, has recently reported that Bolshevik propaganda is prospering in Mexico, where his col-laltorator, one Weinstein, probably identical with the former editor of &quot; Novi Mir,&quot; is engaging with Iluerfca for the admission into Mexico of a regular Soviet representative. The editor of a Labour paper, called &quot; Action,&quot; who has been acting as intermediary between Huerta and Weinstein, has had his newspaper subsidised to the extent of 50,000 Mexican dollars.In Vera Cruz a dispute between tho owners and agents of steamship companies and the local syndicate of stevedores has taken an awkward turn. The stevedores have repudiated theft contract of 1917, and now demand the right to strike in sympathy with other unions without redress to the steamship companies, who would have (a) to employ syndicated labour only, and (p) to reinstate strikers as soon as they were ready to return to work. Naturally the companies have refused these conditions. The strikers are unfortunately assisted and supported by the President of the Republic in contravention of a clause in the Mexican law, which provides the right of everyone to work at a legitimate trade and to be protected if interfered with at such work. At the President^ request, a Commission representing the shipping, commercial, and indus-trial interests of Vera Cruz went to Mexico City on November 2nd. A temporary contract was then signed for 60 days on the basis of the former contract, and business houses reopened. No sooner, however, had the Commission left Mexico City than tho President cancelled his signature and made a new contract with the stevedores, whereby the syndicate would in future unload all vessels for account of the Govern-ment, who would charge expenses to the steamship companies. To this the companies refused to agree.A good deal of disturbance and sabotage followed, gangs of strikers parading the city with a red flag and singing the &quot; International&quot; Soviet hymn. They impeded the shipment of passenger freight, interfered with trains entering and leaving the port, and forbade the transport of goods through the city. As the commander of the local garrison had received orders not to interfere with the strikers except in case of open and flagrant disorder, the strikers&apos; &quot;police&quot; commanded the situation. Many foreign vessels with a total of between 20 and 25 million tons of freight were held up in the harbour.The activities of Manahendra Nath Roy, the Indian Mexican extremist, seem to have been unprofitable to his party. An article in &quot;Gale&apos;s Magazine&quot; for October states that he left behind him three parties where there had been one, and fierce bitterness where there had been comradeship and fraternity. The editor of &quot;Gale&apos;s&quot;has always contended that Roy is an American spy. In Moscow, where it soon became evident that Roy&apos;s presence at the Third International was rather in the interests of India than of Mexico, he was rebuked by Lenin, who challenged as exaggerated his statement that the fate of Europe depended upon the revolutionary movement in the East.   A letter written
by tho Communist Party and I.W.W. at Mexico as soon as they learnt that he was going to Moscow as their delegate, and protesting against any recognition of him in that capacity, arrived in Moscow only after his departure.A former German secret service agent named Kurt Jahnke, alias Steffens, is reported to have gone to Mexico to create unrest in industrial and munition centres in North America. He is said to be extraordinarily able and well equipped with funds. Apparently he was at one time employed hy a former consul in Mexico in certain doubtful work, and au official disavowal of the man by the German Government does not altogether carry conviction. Pie went to Mexico ostensibly as secre-tary to one Professor Helhuan, who has gone to that country to study agriculture.12. SOUTH AMERICAN STATES. ARGENTINE.Socialism is practically confined to the capital, and even there it Is of a mild blend. The official Socialist Party have been obliged to moderate any extreme tendencies in order to retain the sympathies of the Conservatives, to the discontented members of which party they, to a great extent, owe their scats in the Congress and Senate.BRAZIL.During the recent strikes in favour of Communistic ideas 1,600 agitators were arrested and were to have been deported. The strikers, not content with obtaining improved conditions, insisted that there should be no deportations. The Government were obliged to consent, and wero not even able to insist that the men who were to have been deported should refrain from preaching Communism.URUGUAY.The International Police Convention, which was signed in February last ad referendum by the representatives of various South American Governments, has now been approved by the Government of Uruguay.
PART II.1. AN UNDERCURRENT OP POLICY : REACTIONARY INTRIGUE IN CENTRAL EUROPE. NOVEMBER 1918-AUGUST 1920.Fob word : This account, the source of which requires it to be read with reservations, is based upon a report by Trebitsch Lincoln, who, between November 1918 and September 1920, teas used as their principal intermediary by Prussian section of the conspiratoi s, with, whom it deals. Lincoln states that he discovered plots against his life on the part of his colleagues, lie certainly went to Czecho-Slovakia, where he gave his account of &quot;their proceedings to Dr. Benes and Professor Mazaryk. The extracts and paraphrases which follow have been kept to general lines, and, the parts of the report which were most likely to be untrust-worthy, namely, LincoliCs account of his oicn dealings with various personalities, have been disregarded.Since November 1918, the intrigues and projected demolition by German and Russian Monarchists of the Treaty of Versailles have passed through three Successive phases.In the first, which came to a head in the Kapp-Luttwitz Putsch of March 1920, and which was the only one iu which the Hohenzollerns were directly involved, the action was confined to Prussia, and the principal actors were Prussian officers under Colonel Bauer (with Ludendorff&apos; in the background) and Russian monarchists in Berlin under Captain Pabst : the purpose of the National Union which guided the action in this phase was the annihilation of the Social Democratic Party, then as now, in power ; the establishment for a few months of a military dictatorship under Ludendorff&apos;; the alteration of the Weimar Constitution to give the President monarchical attributes ; the appointment to the Presidency of an eminent Monarchist (Hindenburg) who would, when the opportunity occurred, resign in favour of the Crown Prince.In the second phase the action is transferred to Bavaria, but still confined to Germany. The Kapp Putsch, prematurely sprung in March 1920 to forestall the Governments disbandment of Erhardt&apos;s Marine Brigade, has failed. Ludeudorff. has gone prudently into retirement with his friend Dr. George Heiin, the Bauern-Konig, in the Bavarian forests. The National Union, lifeless since the flight from Berlin of Colonel Bauer and Captain Pabst is dissolved, and its remnants, as well as all other Prussian military societies and organisations joined to the newly formed Supreme Councilux Bavaria, whence, organised labour being too strong in Prussia, the counter-revolution will be worked. Herr Poner, the Bavarian Chief of Police, and Herr Kahr, the Bavarian Minister-President, favour the movement, and the latter takes steps to induce the southern States to join Bavaria against the Social Democrats in Prussia. Troops from Mecklenburg, Pomeran, and Schlesien will concentrate on Berlin, as soon as the Southern troops pass the Saxon-Prussian frontier. The Berlin Government gets Avind of the plan and communicates with the Bavarian Government which advises the conspirators to desist.lu the third phase the action of the conspirators passes beyond the German borders. The conspirators, in order to secure a sure base for future operations, resolve to conquer Austria and use that country as their centre of operations.   This move transforms a purely German counter-
revolution into a Central European Monarchist combination, whose plaii is to unite Prussian Monarchists from tho North, Russian Monarchists from Berlin, Bavaria, Hungary, and the Austrian Monarchists against Austria. Prussian, Bavarian, Monarchist Austrian, and Hungarian troops woultl then set up a military dictatorship in Vienna. Admiral Horthy, with whom the conspirators had been in touch since January, 1920, was to be asked permission to firing German troops to Hungary where they would be distributed in groups as farm hands and, tinning both them and Hungarian troops of his own, to have them drilled and trained in accord-ance with a new scheme of infantry tactics devised by Ludendorlf and Colonel Bauer for use in the next great war.When the German military organisations were ready the concerted movements would begin. Vienna would be occupied and a provisional Government set up in Austria. From Vienna the conspirators and their forces would go via Bohemia to Saxony and thence to Prussia. Should Czecho-Slovakia undertake hostile action, Prussian troops, strengthened by troops from Pommeni, would march from Silesia into Bohemia. Russian troops interned in Germany would join in the movement through Bavaria. Austria and Czecho-Slovakia once set aside, a common frontier would bo secured between Germany and Hungary. After clearing Prussia of the Social Democrats, the intention was to establish a military dictatorship under Ludendorffand to initiate a counter-revolution in Russia. When the counter-revolution was completed and tho Bolshevik regime had received its death blow, the Russo-German-Hungarian combination, after a period of quiescence to enable the reconstituted &quot; Mittel-Europa &quot; to exploit Russia, was to proclaim war against the Entente Powers. The final goal of the political action was planned on singular audacious lines : Ger-many was to receive Alsace-Lorraine. Southern Belgium and Northern France including the Channel ports ; Northern Belgium to go to Holland ; Denmark to be incorporated with Germany ; German-Austria and the German-speaking parts of Bohemia to fall to Germany ; Poland&apos;to bo divided between Russia and Germany, with the Vistula as boundary ; Hungary to regain her former frontiers, with a rectification of the frontier on the Dukla Pass and a bridgehead north of the Pass ; Russia to regain her former frontiers, and, in addition, the Dardanelles, Anatolia, Armenia, Persia, Mesopotamia, and a completely free hand in Asia; Rumania to be apportioned between Russia, Hungary and Bulgaria. The boundary between Russia and Hungary would thus be the Carpathians and the River Pruth. The Danube would form the Hungarian- Bulgarian boundary, Bulgaria receiving the Dobrudja as far as the Danube delta. Negotiations to be opened with the Badoslavov party in Bulgaria, to which would be conceded the whole of Thrace, inclusive of Constantinople, Salonica, parts of Old Serbia, and North Albania, and thereby an outlet to the Adriatic. Restored Russia would receive the Dardanelles, Anatolia and Asia Minor. The Italians, who were brought into the combination later, were promised, in case of success, French Savoy with Nice, Corsica, Malta and Tunis, with a further hint that the question of Egypt and the East Mediterranean, and the question of an African colony for Italy would be discussed later. The military plan was later modified to the extent that instead of sending German troops to Hungary they were to be concentrated as civilians in Bavaria to work with organisations within Austria itself. Hungarian troops were to be sent to the west of Hungary and German troops to be transported in groups by the Bavarian organisation, Orgesch, to Austria, with a view to concerted action at the right moment with the Austrian counter-revolu-tionary troops. The conspirators timed the Austriau eotip for October, or the first part of November, 1920. .   .
eoThe conspiracy has boon described at considerable length in &quot; Tho Times&quot; of 28th, 29th, and 30th December, under tho title of &quot;The German PJot.&quot; The causes of its failure lay in profound underlying differences of opinion and aim between the parties concerned. Thus Admiral Horthy, while, it is stated, giving his entire consent to the scheme for the restoration of Prussian predominance, was, at the same time, obliged to play up to the French against whom that scheme Avas fundamentally directed, and whose &quot;imperial &quot; policy in Central Europe was directed to the restoration of the Hapsburgs as a make-weight against a renewal of true German Imperialism. Again, General LudendorfF, Avhoin the conspirators regarded as their chief and with whom they maintained continual touch, never took a single step in it without reservations of some kind, appears to have submitted himself in au almost servile manner to Minister-President von Kahr iu Bavaria, but never to have kept his promise to enter into direct conference with Admiral Horthy. Other members of the conspiracy Avere equally divided.The cause of this lies in the political situation, in Bavaria, Austria and Hungary. In the Bavarian reactionary Orgesch block and the military organisation called Orgesch, which is iu secret communication with all German reactionary political and military societies, there are two political parties, one pursuing the Pan-German policy, and the other jealous of Prussian leadership. Both have, indeed, the same aim up to a certain point. Both desire the conquest of Austria, hut the aim of the great German party is a union witli Austria preliminary to its annexation by Germany to divert the suspicious of the French, while the other party aims at a final union on the part of Bavaria with the Tyrol, the Vor Arlberg and a portion of Salzburg, while the remainder of Austria should be joined to Germany,In Austria there are similar differences of opinion. The Christian Socialists, Avho find most support&apos;in Lower Austria, aim at the restoration of the Hapsburgs, whereas the districts of Karuten and Steiermark are absolutely opposed to the restoration. The Austrian Tyrol aud Salzburg are absolutely under the influence of the Bavarian organisations.In Hungary the division between the parties is still more marked. Since the establishment of the Horthy regime tho country has been really governed by a clique consisting of five men ; the Deputy Julius von Gombos, President of the Moewe; Rittmeister von Gorgey ; Rittmeister Kozma ; HerrTibor von Eckhardt, Chief of the Press Bureau of the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Council of Ministers ; and Major Pronay. This clique is behind all the actions of President Horthy. Of the five, Gorgey and Eckhardt are pro-French, but all are anti-Hapsburg, Major Pronay having gone so far as to make arrange-ments for the assassination of the ex-Emperor Carl on a recent intended visit to Hungary. The Five are able tc remove Ministers who resist them, and are responsible for having made Teleki Minister-President and Streter Minister for War.On the other hand, opposed to the Five in Hungary is a strong party Avhich aims at the Hapsburg restoration. To this clique belong Chief of the Staff Berzeviczy, Baron Kaiiya, late of the Foreign Office, Baron Banffy, Chief of the Cabinet Bureau in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Graf Khuen, of the Foreign Office, Major Stajakovicz, Director of Intelligence in the General Staff, as well as other high aristocrats and clergy. The tAVO groups are bitterly opposed. The pro-Hapsburg clique saAv in the Prussian conspirators, whose plan aimed at the joining of Austria and Germany, the antagonists of the restoration of the Monarchy. Between these tAVO groups Admiral Horthy wavers.   When the counter-
revolution was organised at Arad and later at Sczedeg, lie was virtually appointed to bis present office by the Five, but no sooner bad he become liegent than he began to use other influences to counter theirs. Horthy is not sure himself whether he is a Carlist or not. He would communi-cate with the ex-Kaiser Karl, but, at tho same time, he allows himself to bo restrained by the Five, so performing a double equestrian act with one foot on each party His success and maintenance in office is due to the fact that tho Caiiists amery, ou the whole, gaining ground in Hungary. At heart, however, ho is a strong anti-Semite and a thorough believer in the Pan-German policy. The abolition *of Czecho-Slovakia ho considers his first duty, in respect of which he defers the settlement with roumania and Jugo-Slavia which he anticipates later.By the end of June 1920 the conflict on the German side between Prussians and Bavarians and on the Hungarian side between car lists and anti-car lists had become very acute. The Prussians had no objection to Austria being provisionally annexed to Bavaria, so as to throw dust in the eyes of the Entente and especially of France. They were, however, decidedly opposed to this happening under Bavarian guidance, while the Bavarians, on the other hand, were afraid of Prussian preponderance and declined to have anything to say to ludendorff&apos;s leadership. The Hungarian car lists were also opposed to Prussian leadership, because it would mean the end of their aspirations to restore the double monarchy. All parties, in short, were willing to carry through tho scheme against Austria, but each insisted that it alone should play the leading part,, and play it for its own ends. Pressure was brought upon Colonel Bauer by the Prussian party to take no step in Budapest in the absence of Ludendorff&apos;, whose influence there as the principal protagonist of tho Prussian system would have checkmated the plans of the car lists and of the more liberal Bavarians.Difficulties between the two parties also arose ou the question of how far the Russians were to be admitted to the scheme. The Polish offensive was in&apos; the heyday of its success and the Hungarians, while anxious to assure themselves of Russian friendship, declined to bring the latter into the combination. As, from the Prussian point of view, a German-Russian combination was the basis and condition of the whole movement, the Prussians addressed an ultimatum to the Hungarians in the matter. A member of the White Russian Provisional Government was invited to Budapest and the Prussian party advised him to join the Bolsheviks against the Poles, since both Germans and Iin-perialist Russians desired the elimination of Poland in order to establish a community of frontiers and possibly later to make war in common against France and the Succession States.At the last negotiations between the parties, a conference held at Munich on 31st August, the differences were superficially smoothed out, and all parties agreed upon the Austrian General Metzger as the leader of the counter-revolution in A ustria, Avhich was to be represented as a purely Austrian affair in order to give the Succession States an excuse or motive to join in the action. Prince Lichtenstein was to take over the leadership in the Steierniark, Colonel Hulgerth in Kiirnten, while the Orgesch organisation would form the centre of the movement in the Eastern Provinces, Tyrol, and Salzburg. Vienna itself was to be invested with Prussian troops who were to be concentrated in Bavaria by tho middle of September and then smuggled by groups into the Steiermark. At the Munich conference, however, the Anstrians came to no political compromise, the Hapsburg party thinking that if the counter-revolution succeeded it would be easy with the help of the Hungarian car lists to bring about a restoration of the Hapsburg Monarchy, while the great
German parly ou the other hand secretly cherished the design after they had conquered Vienna and after Rarnten and the Steiermark had become anti-IIapsburg, to drive straight for their goal regardless of the pro-Hapsburg. This accounts for the arrangement that Prussian troops should he used for the investment of Vienna. Nominally, under the leadership of General Metzger, these, once control of Vienna was secured, would really be used by Captain Erhardt, to oust the car lists, their action in this regard being furthered with the help of troops from Kiirntcu and Steiermark, as well as by a detachment under the command of Major Pronay and by armed peasants from the district between the Danube and the Theiss.The weakness of tho whole movement Avould appear to lie in the profound differences of aim of the various parties. All are agreed regarding the first stage, but each is equally determined to shoulder out the other when the first stage has been attained. The out-and-out Prussians appear to have been disappointed in the prudence of General Ludendorff, who, while assenting to their plans, would never come into the open iu conference with other parties.In July the conspirators took steps to sound Italy as to their designs and to secure, if not her aid, at any rate her benevolent neutrality. They found a ready ear for their proposals, which were ultimately transmitted to the highest Italian authorities of all, and are stated, with what truth it is difficult to say, to have received at least the platonic assent of Signor Giolitti. The Italian interest in the Jugo Slavia and co-related questions, such as that of the Adriatic and the strategic question of the presence of the Jugo-Slavs in Krain, Italian anxiety over the pre-poilderant influence of France in the Mediterranean and in European policy as well as regarding the eventuality of a Hapsburg restoration, is shown in their encouragement of all that tends to the strengthening of Germany proper and in their inclination to any step or action hitherto fording or conducing in any way to further the Anschluss of Austria to Germany. The conspirators, as has been previously noted, offered other inducements. The final answer is stated to have been that Italy would not interfere, and as soon as she saw that the action was in the way of success she would remove her troops from Villach, leaving weapons, munitions, and provisions for the counter-revolutionary troops.2. A CONVERSATION WITH MARSHAL PUSUDSKI ON THE BOLSHEVIK REGIME AND ITS POLICY TOWARDSPOLAND.This Conversation took place in November 1920.&quot; I have made a special study of the Bolsheviks aud know them thoroughly. 1 had thousands of Bolshevik prisoners examined by expert Russian-speaking officers. From their reports I have come to the conclusion that there are two main reasons why the Bolsheviks have so tight a hold on the Russian people : first, they have utterly destroyed the last vestiges of culture, and reduced man to n primitive animal state, and, secondly, they have abolished all forms of privilege. The common people fear the re-establishment of private or class distinctions and privileges. For the Russian people nothing exists to-day between the extreme Right and the extreme Left, Every time the counter-revolu-tionaries met with success they offered the people Generals, former Ministers, and former Governors. With peculiar Russian shrewdness the people accepted them for a short trial, and then went back to Bolshevism.
Why ? Because they feared the restoration of ancient privileges. Wherever and whenever Reactionaries and Bolsheviks are pitted one against the other the people will choose the latter. Tsarist Russia we know, Bolshevik Russia we are experiencing, but I see no &apos; Third Russia &apos; which will save us from both the. others.&quot; None the less the doom of the Bolsheviks is inevitable. They have converted Russia into a land of death, and, after all, people naturally strive after life. Again, they have never gained a victory against external foes their triumphs have only been those of civil war. Tho twelfth hour is undoubtedly at hand. But whether it is now 11.15, 11.30, or 11.45, no man can say.&quot;Nations may conclude trade agreements with the Bolsheviks. They are under a grave delusion if they think thus to modify the internal situation, or the Soviet Government, or if they hope to get anything in return. There are far deeper influences working in Russia than are apparent. It is not Bolshevism I fear. I fear the elemental force that is behind a hundred million starving people. I fear a repetition of the great barbarian migrations. The advance against Polanl gave us a foretaste. They came down upon us like the Mongolian hordes. They came in many cases with their wives, their children, their carts, their trucks, seeking food, warmth, and loot. Nothing will stand against such an invasion. The Russian people are inert. Resistance cannot be expected from them. But an hour will strike when, by a process unknown and incomprehensible to us, the psychology of the entire people will undergo a sudden and complete transformation.   .   .   .&quot; I anticipate no decisive move for tho time being on the part of the Bolsheviks. When Petlura and Balahovitch are settled with Soviet foreign activities will be confined to diplomacy. That is to say, they will blackmail us and England. But they will go on preparing for war, and Avithin six months will attempt a renewed advance westwards. They will not pass through Poland, because 1 shall succeed in barring the Avay. But they may try Roumania, or through Eastern Galicia into Hungary. Or they may concentrate on the East, Avhich means danger to the British,&quot; The only real barrier against an advance of the Bolsheviks west-Avards, so far as I can see, lies in close co-operation of Poland Avith Latvia, Esthonia, and Finland. I regret that in this respect the British Government does not see eye to eye Avith me. Esthonia, I know, is not perfectly sound. I let the Bolsheviks snatch her from me. But I rely on common economic interests to Aveld us together. I cannot rely upon Roumania because there is the big gap of the Ukraine separating us. No outsider will ever make much headway in the Ukraine on account of the strong national feeling prevalent there. The peasants are opposed to all invaders, Avhether Bolsheviks, anti-Bolsheviks, Russians, or Poles.&quot;3. AN ANARCHIST CONGRESS IN PARIS.The attitude of the Anarchists toAvards revolutionary movements and ideas of the day, other than their own, is not noAV often made clear. The tide of Communism creeping into all countries from Soviet Russia through the channels of the Third International, has made almost negligible and curiously old-fashioned the once violent revolutionary doctrines based on extreme ideas of individual liberty.An Anarchist Congress in Paris, attended in November by some 26 &quot; groups &quot; and 17 &quot; individual adherents &quot; from different parts of Franco, shoAved itself quaintly divided upon general question such as the
Dictatorship of tho Proletariat, tho altitude towards other parlies, and propaganda, The main difference in the Congress was that between the Individualists a outrance and members who believed it compatible with their anarchist principles to encourage unrest by the manifestation of theories diametrically opposed to their own.The discussion on the Dictatorship of the Proletariat was heated and at times violent. Sebastian Fauro, in defining an anarchist as a man who will not be subject to authority and does not wish to exercise authority over others (a man, he said, who is an opponent of authority, but who wishes to exercise authority over others, ceases to be an anarchist) could not admit that Dictatorship could be fought and exercised at the same time. One could not cure one evil by another. Other &quot;individual adherents,&quot; such as Autiguac, Veber, and Salvator, thought that despite all the sympathy which anarchists may have for the Russian revolution, they could not accept such a dictatorship. The anarchist concerns himself with the happiness of the individual as tending to the happiness of the community, and not with the happiness of the masses to tho detriment of the individual. There ought to be a permanent understanding between workers of all classes and not a dictatorship of intellectuals and politicians over manual labourers. Anarchist doctrines are anti-authority. They have not varied. There is no difference between the the Dictatorship of the Proletariat and the Dictatorship of the bourgeois class.Bon temps and Raimbaud (the hitler of the Comite Ouvrier Soldat) maintained, on the other hand, that though they were not partisans of the dictatorship that the time was now come for practical realisation rather than for philosophical affirmations. They had had enough of dreams, and must commence to learn to organise themselves in prepara-tion for a revolution. One must keep pace with the times ; because of the degree of popular retrogression, a system which can adapt itself to that degree of evolution is necessary.   Dictatorship is a necessary evil.The Individualists finally carried the day,, and the conference appointed a commission to draw up a fresh statement of anti-authority ideas.The discussion regarding the attitude to be adopted towards members of other parties was mainly concerned with the question of whether anarchists should abjure tho Syndicates, or whether, Syndicalism being purely economic, militants were free to belong to it or not as they chose. Veber (individualist) said that they were in complete disagreement with all political parties. Anarchists could attend the Comite de Defense Sociale, but they ought not to attend the new Confederation des Travail-leurs du Monde, as this organisation adheres to the Third International. Anarchists could do good propaganda work in the Syndicates provided that they would refuse mandates and official posts. Le Meillour attacked both the majoritaire and minoritaire syndicates whom he accused of feathering their nests.The sense of the meeting appeared to be that anarchists, while con-tinuing anarchists, could do good work in the syndicates so long as they accepted no mandates and refused to become officials. Officialdom, it Avas said, destroyed individuality. As regards propaganda, it Avas con-tended that the society of the future could not be organised in advance. It would follow the current of events and would form itself as made by the individual. Who could tell the hour and the minute of the revolu-tion ? Why Avish to build at present a plan of future society which would be destroyed by the men who would make the revolution ?
4. INTERNATIONAL CONTROL IN TANGIER.Mr. Walter B. Harries mordant messages to &quot; The Times &quot; aro tho only gaps in the mist of more important events which conceals from view the anomalies of international control at Tangier. They reveal an international situation which, while hindering reform, leaves the city and matters municipal in a deplorable condition.Locally it is agreed on all hands that the present state of things is impossible, and that international control, as now constituted, can do nothing but prolong it. France or England, separately or together, could lender Tangier fair and healthy, and yet, because of the presence of another power within two hours&apos; steam from Gibraltar, there exist conditions of dirt and neglect, invitations to disease described as equal to those of an Abyssinian town or remote spots in the Andes. For instance, tho sanitary authorities ordered that all rubbish should bo removed from dwelling-houses at an early hour. Protests came from the Spanish Minister because this new departure encroached on privileges enjoyed by a certain class of his subjects who were accustomed to overhaul all refuse in search of food for their pigs. This protest was sustained, to the detriment of the health of householders, and also, perhaps, of that of prospective consumers of pork.Despite the nationalisation of the city and matters municipal, some controlling authority is clearly needed in Tangier. The present situation is the result of an impasse. Two powers of proved colonial capacity, both favourably regarded by the Moors, ont of mutual distrust ruefully admit a third which is neither favourably regarded nor capable to equal privileges with themselves. It appears to be agreed that if by some unhappy chance Spain should acquire Tangier life and property would be unsafe and commercial men would hasten to leave. Mr. Harris believes that under Spanish command it would be absolutely unsafe for Europeans to live outside the walls of Tangier.As the Moors express it the English are liked the French are respected the Spaniards are despised. British control, urgently though Englishmen in Tangier may desire it, is believed to be out of the question. It -would imply command of both sides of the Straits. Moreover, Tangier being surrounded by hills within easy reach of strong French forces, British occupation would only be possible in times of peace. An Englishman who lived for 17 years in the interior, attached to tho Sultan, and of whose patriotic attitude no one could have any doubt, expressed views extremely pessimistic regarding the possibility of British coutro&apos;, and concluded by saying that, although it was extremely regrettable from a British standpoint to allow the French to take Tangier, it seemed the only practicable solution.As to what would happen to British enterprise, supposing the French were granted control, even among Englishmen on the spot there are wide differences of opinion. The majority appear to think that if Tangier belonged to France doors for British enterprise in Morocco would be partially if not wholly closed. The agent for the chief line of steamers pointed out that, at Casablanca British shipping is now almost paralysed owing to forced detentions through preference hi all matters being accorded to French steamers, and felt sure that similar conditions would soon prevail at Tangier. Under these circumstances he was inclined, from the point of view of the interests of his own line, to prefer Spanish control.Mr. Frank Harris, on the other hand, who, without being anti-English in local politics, is first and foremost a friend of the Moors, and
Printed by Eyre and Spottiswoode, Ltd., East Harding Street, K.U.is also in close touch with all the French authorities, says that the French have no desire to exclude British trade. On the contrary, they always seek British capital. He points out that in Tangier 22 per cent, of the interests in proposed harbour concessions are British. Mr. Harris was asked by tho French to find British capital for the development of petroleum and composed a syndicate including well-known British financiers. He gave other instances to show that British capital and support would be welcomed, aud that by such means French monopoly would be avoided. The Englishman attached to the Sultan, whose opinion has already been quoted, said that French control would result iu wharves and railways with communication by land and sea, while lands and properties would be enhanced and assured.Of the Spaniards it is reported that thoy are despised both by the Moors and the French. It is related that liaisuli once asked for two Christian captives. Being brought five Spaniards, he was very angry, saying that he wauled Christians not Spaniards. The sad plight of the Spanish soldier, badly paid, ill-cared for, aud lacking hospital treatment, excites general pity, a sentiment upon which no army of occupation can prosper.The hatreds of the past are ingeniously maintained by the Spaniards. Tho French respect mosques. The Spaniards invariably convert them into headquarters or offices. The Moors say : &quot;Look at Spain. Of all &quot; the mosques there not one now exists ; but look at Tunis and Algiers ; &quot; there, under the Freuch, they have all remained intact.&quot; Aud, indeed, on one occasion when it had been necessary to take a mosque in order to eject the enemy, General Lyautey caused it to be repaired and then handed it over to the Moors.French expenditure, on the other hand, does good to the country, while the sums disbursed by the Spaniards all go to their own officers, officials, and contractors. It is thought that if England supported the pretensions of the Spaniards with regard to Tangier it would mean some-thing not unlike a scverauce from France. Even were the Spaniards installed in Tangier the French could make it impossible for them to remain since the City depends entirely upon the interior for food.
