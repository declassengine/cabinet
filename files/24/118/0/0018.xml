BALTIC.S.N.O. Baltic, renorts that German ships entering Biorko pick up pilots either off Ghalli or at the Northern end of Peisan island, Pilots are all Finns.    Northern Channel only used as Sea approach is dangerous on account of mines.The Soviet Government have issued a notice that navi-gation in the Russian part of the Gulf of ^Inland is closed until the spring as safe navigation cannot he guaranteed owing to buoys marking the swept channel into Kronstadt having been carried away &quot;by ice.ITALY.The Destroyer &quot;Oon.fienza&quot; was- launched on Dec 18th oonpl voted with the exception of her armament.Rearmament, of Sx-^enemy Vessels..The commission appointed to enquire into the subject of the re-armament of the 3 hips taken over from the German and Austrian navies has reported that it is useless to attempt to make use of them with their present armament and fittings.     It has been found, especially in the ex-Austrian sbaps, that the scantling in the wake of the guns is too light, also that the question of the supply of ammunition in both oases is too complicated.     In view of this report the Minister of Marine has decided to re-arm the ships with guns and tubes of Italian pattern.    The gun mountings and scantlings are to be strengthened, 6 inch guns of 45 calibres are to take the place of the 5.9 inch-guns and 4 inch guns the place of the 4.1 inch guns.    The Austrian ships are to be re-armed with 4 inch puns.    The Ministry of Marine think that  350,000 sterling (equivalent) will suffice for these alterations.Italian. Naval Policy.It is not proposed to commence any light cruisers or other cruisers for at least another two years, but   the three large flotilla leaders of the &quot;Leone&quot; class are to have their construction hastened, and it is hoped to have them completed by the end of the coming year.The Minister of Marine has instructed the Italian naval designers to draw up designs for what he calls the &quot;Ideal Battle Cruiser&quot; embodying&quot;all the lessons learnt in the late war. There is not the slightest intention of building such a ship, as it   would he at present far beyond Italian naval resources.&quot;&apos;BLACK SEA.No action will   be taken by British Naval forces in the event of a Bolshevik attack on Batoum.Wrangel,s warships are reported to have arrived at Bizerta on 28th December and are in quarantine,MUM-Admiral Troubridge, whose appointment as President of the International Danube Commission terminated on Jan. 1st, Is to be succeeded byv a Hungarian.
