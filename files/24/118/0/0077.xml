There appears to be a growing impression that employers are in league to force a reduction of wages arid there is a very general oooosition to working short time.   Nevertheless the revolutionary spirit is not as strong as might neve been expected, when the incitements to class hatred, contained in the &quot;Daily Rerald&quot; and other extremist newsoa^ors. are considered.   The belief that the resumption of trade with Russie will immediately relieve unemploy-ment is growing, in spite of the facts that have been so often published,There are a few instances of men agreeing to accept lower wages, which is the first step to a fall in the cost of living. This appears to be due to the depletion of trade union funds by unemployment benefits.   The trade union secretaries are themselves recommending this course.Processions of the unemployed apoear daily in the streets in hondon, but the impression that they are unemployable is cutting down contributions from the publTic*   Some of the money thus collected has undoubtedly been misappropriated.The Labour Party&apos;s &quot;Peace with Ireland&quot; campaign has begun. ?he opening meeting at Glasgow must have discouraged the organisers. There was an attempted outrage by Sinn Feiners in London on January 15th.Malone&quot;s sentence of six months imprisonment in the Second division was confirmed at ftewington Sessions on January 17th.The/
The circulation of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is reported to hav declined by 40,000 daily.Mr. Francis Meynell has taken over the editorship of &quot;Th Communist&quot; - &quot;the organ of t*ie Communist Party of Great Britai fie announced the fact in yesterday&apos;s &quot;Daily Herald&quot; in an advertisement bordered by reproductions of jewels and questioi marks. He has, it may oe remembered, never accounted for the money he invested in Sxohecjuor Bonds.
The London District Council of.the Unemployed organisations, with headquarters at the International Socialist Club, has been particularly active during the woek:   a manifesto, Signed by Holt, Jennett and Phillips, in which the Council claims to represent 250,000 unemployed workers in London, has been issued to Trades Councils and looal Labour parties, and a number of processions have been carried out.    The manifesto contains little new matter, but makes the usual demands for full maintenance at trade union rates, trade with Russia, a &quot;national convention&quot; and the despatch by the Council of Action of an ultimatum to the Government threatening direct action unless the two first demands be conceded.The largest demonstration in London last week was on ; January 11th;   a contingent of 200 assembled at Highbury under the leadership of Macdonald and marched to St. Pancras Arches, where it was. joined by groups of unemployed from Finsbury, Walthamstow, St. Pancras, Southward, V^illesden and Stepney.   Numbering about 1,000, &apos;;,the men marched to Hyde Park, where they.were joined by a contingent from Lambeth:   subsequently they marched to Booleston Square, where they halted for a deputation to Visit Wo. 33.   They then returned to Hyde Park, where speeches were made.   It seems probable, that some misappropriation of funds has,occurred:   many of the marchers observed during the week were lads tf 15 and 16 who could not possibly have served, and when questioned as to their war record, they have in several instances run off with their collecting boxes without making any reply.   There is disagreement among the Islington unemployables regarding the money collected:   six boxesbelonging/
m  di  **belonging to the genuine unemployed were stolen, it is alleged by the unemployables, last week.About 400 unemployables attempted to demonstrate outside Wewingtcn Sessions House on the occasion of MeloneTs appeal on January 17th., but were prevented by th$police. ;, V \The officers of the Walthamstow unemployables are reported to be, without exception, Communists:   it is further said that their chairman, received  80 through Communist channels at Christmas time:   Communist literati! is distributed from the address to which the collections are taken.The following report has been: received from a roliatl source:&quot;The Acton Unemployed Committee are.talking of again talcing possession of the local Baths to use as headquarters.   Some of the local Councillors are endeavouring to secure the sanction of the Counci to this, but the men themselves say that they will take possession of the Baths whether the sanction is granted or otherwise. . Although in the area which this Committee represents, Acton, &quot;baling and Raiwell, there are many thousands of ;unemployod, the Committee is supported by not&apos;more than 500 men, most of these being unmarried.&quot;Tho marches to the West End are usually-support! x    by 100 men,, of whom 25fo have collecting bozos.   The men with the boxes make money for themselves-, some . ..   by carrying-a&apos;second &quot;box in addition to their official box, and any money collected in these,boxes.is transferred &quot;to their pockets.    It is also quite easy &apos;t6 shake the money from out of the official-boxes. The colleetors gc into public houses, call for drinks, and take a collection from, anyone using the-house.  , . . During a recent march four&apos; of the men were intoxicate! ard heH their boxes taken away frcm them by the - officials-in.charge of the march.   There is &quot; considerable, almost mutual, suspicion emcngst the men that.they-are acting as Police Agents, and all sorts cf 1 suspicious1 actions are discovered.   The . Committee complain of the&apos;a&apos;pathy of the Unemployed and attempt is to be made to secure more support.&quot;The Kensington Unemployed Committee, who are ..now using the Discharged Sailors&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Federation Club House, Kensington ?ark Read, W-*. as -   their headquarters, have now less than 100 supporters and when they organise marches, there are more collectors than processionists.   They complain that &apos; the public is tiring of subscribing to their appeal for money and they are constantly being told that support cannot be given to ^^employables.   The Kensington Committee is talking&apos;of disbanding, throng&apos; lack of support by the unemployed.&quot;On/
On January 16th the Cemberwell and Southwark unemployed seiaed the premises of the Discharged Sailors&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Club at Southwark, hut withdrew on the same day.Tho situation in the provinces is becoming worse.   The idea that tho employers are intriguing to reduce wages is gaining ground.   It is reported that Lever Bros, discharged last wool:-end one thousand of their employees, many of whom have good service records.   On January 15th, at PortSunlight, my correspondent saw a number of girls crying &quot;bitterly as they had received their discharge.   The firm is also reported to be using thoir United States factories instead of those in the Unitod Kingdom, in order to get the favourable American rate of exchange for their export trade.    There are, however, some signs that the steadier men seem to realise that the workers are in some measure responsible for their present plight.   For instance, a foreman said to my Newcastle correspondent, &quot;It is not; right to say so, but the only cure for the ca&apos;canny policy is to give them a good dose of unemployment,&quot; while from Coventry it is reported that a good many engineers have accepted reduced wages in preference to dismissal. Organised marches to various factories in Coventry are still made by the unemployed, but not so many take part in these demonstrations as at first.   Speeches are made by the leaders outside the gates but thoy aro not welcomed by the workers inside.   An instance showing the feeling of the &quot; genuine workors towards the Labour agitators oecurred lastweek outside the Coventry Chain Works.   A body of unemployed, led by Dingley, marched down to these Works during the dinner hour.   Speeches were made and appeals addressed to the workors v/ho v?ere returning to work, but very little notice was taken.   When all the employees had entered, the gates were slammed in the faces of the gathering outside,a/
a hose-pipe was led over the top, and a quantity of water played over them.   Dingley received his full share and made attempt to enter the Works but was barred at every entrance,Trade Union officials appear to bo genuinely concerned about the depletion of funds by unemployment benefits: there seems little doubt that the position of even the large unions will be weakened thereby. Prom several quarters there are indications that trade unionists who neve work would willing] support a levy for the unemployed and had it been possible t carry out the scheme suggested in my report No. 85 the respoi would undoubtedly have beer; considerable.The belief that trade with Russia would relieve unemployment is making much headway and it is imperative that the fact that the volume of trade to be expected with Hussia cannot possibly relieve unemployment in the immediate future should be given wide publicity.tk6 COMMUNISTSOfficials of the various communist parties have been at Leeds during the week to make arrangements for the &quot;Unity convention&quot;, which, it is reported, will be held at the Communist Rooms, 48a, Burley Street, Leeds.   The hall holds only about 100 people and the view is expressed by local communists that the meeting will be a fiasco.The communist parties do not appear to be adding greatly to their actual membership in the provinoes, but are trying work their way into various labour bodies: in Birmingham, for instance, Shepperson, Brain and Blanchard have succeeded in getting themselves elected to the Trades and Labour Council, while the Rochdale branch of the Communist Party has applied for/
for affiliation to the Trade and Labour Council, who recommended that the aoplication be granted but decided, in view of certain opposition, to take a card vote of the affiliated unions.   From Coventry, Nottingham end Leicester little progress is reported and James Stewart, the Midlands organiser who has recently been in the last named town, expressed himself as &quot;disgusted&quot; with the local revolutionary movement.   The Coventry branch of the Communist Party of Great Britain is in debt to the extent of  2. 15. 0. and has decided not to send a delegate to the Leeds convention, owing to the expense involved.   The Coventry &quot;Hands off Russia&quot; Committee is also in debt, the accounts at the end of 1920 showing a deficit of  16.   B. M. Emery has elected himself delegate to the Leeds convention of the Coventry branch of the Communist Party (British Section of the 3rd &apos; International); this branch has only five members.   Tom &apos; Dingley who is closely associated with Emery is active in this area on behalf of the &quot;Red&quot; International of Trade Unions and is trying to reorganise the local shop stewards movement and has convened a meeting for January 23rd.    It is stated locally and is most probably true that &quot;Solidarity&quot; has been purchased joy Ho:-cow; this rmper has just- doubled its size and halved its price.Francis Meynell takes over one editorship of &quot;The Communist&quot; this week: the current issue announces that the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain has  arranged for the publication of an English edition of the official organ of the Third International. &quot;The Communist International&quot;.   Back numbers are apparently to be issued.It is reported from Glasgow that the Communist party of/
of Great Britain is forming,an- &quot;underground organisation to preparo for the revolution&quot;; one of its principaljobjects is said to be the collection of arms and ammunitionJ. T. Murphy is said to h?.ve returned to this countryand to have taken charge of the &quot;j.ced&quot; International of ^*Unions movement.   This report is probably correct as he i$ one of the leaders of the movement and the alleged date of his arrival synchronizes with the publication of the manifesto to which reference was made in my last report.On January 17th C. L. Malone appealed unsuccessfully against his sentence of six months&apos; imprisonment in the &quot; Second Division.   Malone appeared ill at ease during the proceedings and his speeoh was half hearted and lacking in convictionsTH5 &quot;COMMUNIST YOUNG INTERNATIONAL&quot;The Executive Committee of the Communist Young International, of which Margery lewbold is apparently the english representative, has published Vol. 1, No. 1, of an official english edition of the &quot;Correspondence of the Young International&quot;: this appears to.be printed and published in Berlin; the prioe is &quot;onepence&quot;. The paper announces the convocation of the second international congress of the International, to be held on April 25th, Im the agenda, which is not uninteresting, covers, inter alls,! the following points: 1&quot;The economic struggle of proletarian youth. I(a) the Goorcnio program in the last phase of I proletarian class struggle preceding accessioi to.power. . I(b) the agents- of this struggle, (commuriist youflgl organisations, Trade Union groups, apprentices! associations, their situations and relations I to one another). jCommunist education of Youth.(a) the problem of education after accession to power in school/ factory, etc. 1(*)/    j
(b) oommunist edncationary work before accession to power in the communist young organisations.(c) communist eduoationary work in the children&apos;s groups and 3unday-sohools.(d) International concentration of the ohildren&apos;s groups and their organisatory relation to the communist young organisations.The methods of agitation of the communist young organisations.(a) among the industrial working youth.(b) among the farmlabourers1 youth(c) among the public school and college youth. -   (d) among the colonial peoples.The anti-militarist tactics of the communist young organisations.The Communist Young International and the revolutionary nationalistic leagues (Jewish. Irish).The relations of the Communist xoung Organisation to the oommunist parties and that of the Communist Young International to the Communist International.Organisatory questions.(a) the question of the sub-secretariats end their relation to the Executive Committee on one partNand the national organisations on the other.(b) the press-organ of the Young International and its publication and distribution ill all countries and languages. v(o) the international publishing office   (Brachured, oards, badges).(d) the international distribution of brochures.etcI&apos;The German edition of the &quot;Correspondence&quot; contains a list of the 62 organisations so far invited to the April congress, which will presumably be held in Kussia.   Prom &apos; this list it would appear that the International has ramifications not only in practically every European country but in Mexico, the Argentine, Persia, China, Korea,: Turkestan end Turkey.   The English organisations which have reaeived invitations are the Proletarian Schools, the Young Labour League and the &quot;Young Agricultural Workers League, Manchester.&quot;THE/
M)     the &quot;HANDS OFF INDIA&quot; MOVEMENTOn January 16th a meeting was held at the picton Hall,Liverpool, under the auspices of the local branches of theUnion of Democratic Control and Independent Labour Party;the audience numbered about 400, 25 of whom were Indians,Syud Hossain delivered a violent speech, from which thefollowing are extracts:&quot;Do you know that in India, since the Armistice, atrocities have been committed by the British Forcesf worse than any committed by the Germans in Belgium. I you could only visualise the atrocities in Belgium magnified a thousand fold, you would then have a fair -knowledge of what is taking place in India to-day.  By your representatives, by people you have sent there. Friends, you cannot shirk the responsibility of the . murders committed by your British specimens ruling in India t.6:-da,y.   I &quot;cannot- hardly credit &quot;when I hear you cry f Shame.1 that you realise the conditions, we Indians are suffering under v..&apos;.- *&quot;How much longer are you going to stand the mist! of the rottenest and dirtiest Government that has ever existed.   les berday men?leg&apos;yon read, in your newspaper and no doubt you swallowed the contents like you did y breakfast, that the Take of Ccnnaught was getting a splendid ovation- in India.   That hewas being heartily welcomed.   Comrades, I can assure you that it is more than,-possible] e that the welcome received by His Hoyal -Highness would.bs similar to one that Lenin would rece in England from British capitalists... Perhaps you are not all aware of the reasons why the Duke of Conn aught has gone to India.   Be is to inaugurate new reforms in . India.   Reforms made-up by your present rotten Governs I can tell you friends, that we in India^have already determined not; to attempt to practice these reforms. We know their worth and we scorn them.   We Indians are determined -that- ws shall in future take no part in the assisting of Britishers to rule India.   We can govern ourselves, and: I can t-ll ycu candidly that British rule In&quot;&apos;India will soon oease to exist,&quot; &quot;You call this country a free country, yet there are., millions of. men: and women walking about- all night having no bed&apos;ho sleep cn.r and starving, whilst your capitalists ride - about; in splendid cars - and : eat1 of the - best in the land,   Vih-vn you have your share of these /good;things.., then percaps we shall be able &quot;to call ourselves free men end women ... You must decide whethj .You are, with ,the Indians or against them;   There cannoi &quot;be &quot;any half way measures.   We do not want your charity, ,,,   but we do want your support.   In conclusion let me sayi friends, that the seed.s gathered by the Russians in Etf and conveyed to India are rapidly bearing fruit, and I hope that before long we shall really be free citizen of the world.&quot;After/
After this speech, questions were put by various patriotic members of the audience and uproar ensued; the communists shouted down any adverse remarks and the chairman eventually declared the meeting closed.RAILWAYMENOn January 14th the executives of the national Union of Railwaymen, the Associated Society of Locomotive Snginemen and Firemen and the Railway clerks Association met to discuss the railwaymen1s demand for a share in the management and control of the railways.   The resolution passed was curiously and perhaps misleadingly moderate: it reaffirmed the belief of the executives that &quot;the only means whereby an efficient and economical transport system can exist is by a co-ordinated system under State control&quot;, regretted that &quot;the White Paper issued by the Ministry of Transport shows a clear departure from the Prime Minister&apos;s statement in favour of railway nationalisation, and also the declaration made by the Secretary of State for War at Dundee during the General Election&quot;, concluding &quot;we desire to make it clear to the Government that the repeated declaration of the railwaymen for a snare in management and control was the considered judgment of men who desire their knowledge and exoerience to be utilised for the public good, and we ere taking the necessary steps to inform the Ministry of Transoort of our determination to obtain &quot;this essential change in the workers&apos; conditions.&quot;It seems that increasing unemployment is having a sobering effect upon the railwaymen, who are not themselves united: in London there has been a good deal of friction because the Paddington branch agreed to work short time.   The National Union of Railwaymen has issued a manifesto regarding the form circulated among certain of their employees by the Midland Railway^The/
The view seems to he generally held that short time proposals are a contravention of the guaranteed week and it is reported that the Executive of the National Union of Railwaymen has advised members to adhere to the guaranteed week as short time would place large numbers below the pove line and would operate unequally between various grades. The Executive is further said to have deoided to approach ti Standing Committee of Railway Managers regarding the abolition  of overtime and the tonnage bonus system.THE &quot;DAILY REPAID&quot;A meeting to push the sales of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; was held under the auspices of the &quot;Herald League&quot; and &quot;Rands o Russia&quot; Committee at the Birmingham Town Hall on January if The Chair was taken by Mr. Harrison Bower, the prinoipal speakers being Robert Williams of the Transport Workers and Ben Turner of the Textile Workers.The Chairman proposed a resolution which was later oar &quot;protesting against the Foreign Policy of the Government it refusing to recognise and promote trade relationships with Russian Soviet Government, rejecting the -demand for short! with reduced wages, and calling upon the labour.movement ti take direct action to enforce peace with Russia and to guar to all willing WorkerB full employment or maintenance at ti union rates&quot;.   Sneaking in support of the resolution, Mr. I Robert Williams laid emphasis on the neoessity for supporti the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.   The present daily circulation, he staff was roughly a quarter of a million.   Declaring himself a revolutionary socialist, ne passed on to tne question of  I unemployment stating that he had no. desire to take advantafl of the present situation to tecoh and preach socialism,   mcould/     r
- 11could be no remedy under the Capitalist system for unemploy-ment.    Unemployment was as bad as it was to-day because the working class vested power in the present Coalition Government in the 1918 election.   Unless the workers could .   -   take the ^ower out of their hands and use it themselvestheir position would become as bad as it is in Germany to-day. Direct action was becoming a religion with him; it was the only force^that would move the Government.Mr. Ben Turner who spoke in general terms on the subject of the resolution contended that socialism was the only remedy for the present state of affairs.My correspondent states that the Birmingham agent of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is informing agents that returns are limited to 8 in ievery 26, and adds that the decrease in sales throughout the country amounts, since the price was raised, to 40,000 copies daily.The Labour branch of the Llanelly Unionist Association, . composed of working men, has passed a resolution upholding the freedom of working men and woaen to establish or maintain a daily newspaper in the interests of organised Labour, but strongly objecting to any contributions being made from Trade Union funds in support of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, so long as &apos;- that organ pursues its present policy of advocating direct or industrial action, spreading Bolshevist -oropaganda, and fanning the flames of revolutionary fanaticism.THE LABOUR PARTY AUP IRELANDThe Labour Party&apos;s &quot;Peace with Ireland&quot; campaign opened on January 17th; the speeohes made at Glasgow and Manchester will probably be repeated throughout the campaign and are therefore worth repetition in some detail.   My Glasgowcorrespondent/
oorresponde.it writes as follows:&quot;Mr. William Leonard presided over an audience of about 2,000 persons, composed largely of Irish, in St. Andrew&apos;s&apos;Hall, on January 17th.   The number was less than expected by the promoters, as seating accommodation was provided for over 4,000.   Prom personal observation, it can be quite definitely stated that the Labour Party&apos;s inaugural meeting in connection with their campaign for a Peaoe settlement in Ireland was not a success.   In the part of the hall in which I sat there was a very mij orowd.   Several men on my immediate right were anti. Sinn Fein, and supporters of the Government&apos;s taotici whilst on the left thero were advanced Sinn Feiners, who would accept nothing but an Irish Republic.   %: the resolution was being read, by the Chairman there was pandemonium, and blows were exchanged between tls opposing factions beside me.   Patrick Quinlan, who was apparently employed as a professional !chucker*t! was roaming about the balcony of the hall like a will animal.   Any person who had the temerity to mention a word in denunciation of Sinn Fein, came under the wrath of Quinlan, who immediately proceeded to challenge the unfortunate individual to fight him,&quot;Mr. John Lawson, M.P.., and llr. Adamson, M.P., spokein the terms of the Labour Party report, but were subjectto a good deal of interruption.   The resolution was readhurriedly amidst cries of, :TBurn the Resolution&quot;; &quot;Up theRevolution&quot;; &quot;To Hell with Ireland&quot; etc.   It ran as folio&quot;This meeting deplores the condition of Irelani and approves of the demand of the Labour Party for 5 judicial enquiry into reprisals, expresses satisfaot! with the efforts of the Commission to open peace. negotiations between the Government and the elected representatives of the Irish people^   As a possible&apos; ground for negotiation the meeting approves of the proposals of the Labour ?f.rty that the armed forces withdrawn, the local authorities be responsible for mainton?nee of order, and the immediate election by proportional representation of a constitutional esse to work out whatever con&amp;titution the Irish people desired, subject to the protection of minorities, fii the prevention of Ireland becoming a military or ztf menace to Great Britain.&quot;Mr. Weil MacLean, H.P., who was the next sneaker, couldscarcely be heard even when shouting at the top of his vo,  About 4.0.X),people, composed of persons of Irishfrom all over Lancashire, attended the meeting in MunchesBefore/
Before the speeohes revolutionary airs were played on the organ, such as the &quot;Red Flag&quot;, the &quot;International&quot;, the &quot;Soldiers1 Song&quot;, etc.   Mr. Arthur Henderson and ]&apos;r. J, R. Clyhes mede comparatively moderate speeches without interruption.The speakers at the Cardiff meeting included llr. J. H. Th^s, M.P., general Thomson and Dr. U&amp;rion Phillips.sim feu III GRTJLT  flTAIMOn Ji&apos;Mviry 15th tho police pursued three men who. as itafterwards turned out, intended to burn down the premises ofthe Vacuum Oil Company in Wandsworth.   They fired on the policewithout effect and all three have now been arrested, togetherwith a fourth man who is believed to have come over from Dublinto organise the outrage.   Inside the walls of tne premisesbottles ofwere found six quart/paraffin, a wax taper, cotton wool and boring tools, a coil of rope and a rope ledder.Information has since been received that the organisers of the Self-Determine lion League are anxious to carry on reprisal outrages in England, but think that &quot;gun-men&quot; ought to be sent over from Ireland to assist them by holding up the police.   An application has been made by tne Competent Military Authority in London for two of the most active organisers of the Irish Self-Determination League to be removed to Ireland for internment under the Restoration of Order Regulations.Steps are also being taken to search the premises of the Secretaries of the various branches.ireland there was a slight decrease in the number of outrages during the week, but the commission of serious crime in theareas/
areas under Martial Law shows the determination of the Irish Republican Army to defy every proclamation and restriction.There are, however, indications that people are growing tired of the present situation. Civilians are coming forward with information and are even ready to give evidence against arrested persons, and there is a growing number of defections from the ranks of the Irish Republican Army, During tiie rece attacks on barraoks tnora were no casualties among the polios while the attacking force lost heavily in prisoners; in fact, the attaoks appear to have lost their old soirit.&quot;An T&apos;0glac\ t&apos;;o organ of the Irish Republican Army, appears to hr-ve ceased publication.At the same time toe spirit of the people is increasing bitter and even if p. settlement be reached it will be some ti before the feeling can die down.Recruits for the Royal Iris?; Constabulary continue toco in.   The total strength is now over 13,000,
