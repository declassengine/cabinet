CABINET. /      449POSITION OF THE COAL INDUSTRY,randum by the President of the Board of Trade.I annex a memorandum/ stating the position of the Coal Industry at the present time and discussing the pros and cons of alternative courses of action.This memorandum assumes that during the continuance of the Coal Mines (Emergency) Act the Stato&apos;s guarantee of profits holds good, even though the immediate cause of a deficiency in profits may be industrial depression. This is by no means certain, and the opinion of the Law Officers is being taken on the point.   But, whatever their opinion may be, the desirability, on general grounds, of early decontrol remains.I recommend that I should be authorised: (l) to announce at once that control over home price and export quantities will be removed on the 1st March;(2) to introduce legislation with a view to thedecontrol of profits (i.e. the repeal of tho Coal Mines (Emergency) Act) on 31st March. The Miners Federation with whom I have had two meetings have sent me the following letterTHE MINERS\ FEDERATION OF GREAT BRITAIN.55, Russell Square,London, W.0.1.26th January, 1921.Sir Robert Home, Board of Trade,Whitehall, S.W.1.Dear Sir Robert,&apos; My Committee today further considered the statements with regard to the de-control of the Goal Mining Industry, which you placed before them at
$ the Conference, held on the 13th instant.   my committee have instructed me to inform you that they confirm their decision of the 12th instant, and which was conveyed to you on the same day; viz; that &quot;we cannot acquiese in any proposals for the decontrol of the Coal trade until the Coalowners and ourselves are able to present to the Government a jointly agreed plan for the national control of the Industry, which will effectively substitute the present arrangements&quot;.In these circumstances my Committee are of opinion that no useful purpose would bo served in meeting you today.Yours   very truly,  . (Signed). Prank Hodges.The Coalowners are strongly In favour of decontrolling prices and distribution at the earliest possible moment but contend very strenuously that they are entitled to have their guarantee of nine tenths of their pre war profits maintained until 31st August., which is the date when the Coal Emerges y Act expires in the ordinary course.     I think they would probablyagree to some ^middle&apos; date as a compromise end the ownerscollieriesof the most profitable^would be willing to accept even 31st March, as the date of finanoial decontrol.     It must be anticipated that some of the weak collieries will close and that others will find considerable difficulty in financing their undertakings; but I do not think that the Treasury should be asked to bear the burden cf guaranteeing profits 13 the Coal Industry at a time when every other industry in the country is working either without much profit or at a loss.!    R. S a H.27th January, 1921.
POSITION OF THD OOAL HIHIj^O IKDUoTRY- . 451R E. L g 0 M S FOR, AND g -I g U R g 0? 0 0 K B 0 L-(l)        Power to control the ooal mining industry was continued under the Mining Industry Act for the reason that the general shortage of output and the consequent very high world price of coal would, in the absence of control, have resulted cither in a very hiph home price, or in acute shortage at home owing to the &quot;pull&quot; of tho export price The control of srioe and export necessitated also incidental control of profits, wages and the distribution of homo supplies.(2) Tho present position of control is as follows:-(i)       Export - The quantity of coal which may be exported is limited in order to keep a sufficient supply in thisxcountry, (Section 3 Mining Industry Act),(ii) Supplies for foroi/m bunkers - Por the same reasonthere are certain restrictions on the srees from which foreign bunkor corl m. y be drawn. (Section 3 Mining xIndu stry Act).(iii) Price - A maximum pithead price is fixed for ooalsold for consumption in this country, (Section 3 Mining Industry Act).Profits - Profits are aggregated and pooled; an amount equal to the aggregated pre-war profits standards, plus one-tenth of the excess profits (if any), boing dis-tributablc amongst the owners.   The balance of excess profits is held in suspense Ctnd can only be disposed ofm___by legislation;______x   In view of the present relation between supply and demand, the export restrictions were largely relaxed, and the bunker restrictions completely suspended, on the 10th January, 1921. 0The share is to be variable during the currency of the present wa&amp;es cM^re-inforcement.
but the Government have deolared their intention cf j asking Parliament to sanction its payment to theExchequer.   On the other hand, if and in so far as the aggregated profits fall   &quot;below nine-tenths of the pre-war standards, owing to the operation of control, the State is bound to make them up to that amount. (Coal Lines (Emergency) Act, 1920).(v) -   General advances of wages granted sinoo the commencement of control are payable under directions given by the Coal Controller (Defence of the Realm Regulation 9G) or Secretary for Mines (Section 3 Mining Industry Aot)(vi) Distribution -   There is no legal power (apart from the Defence of the Realm Regulations) to control distribution&apos;, but it is obvious that, as long as the . prioe of oeal is controlled, there must be some artificial distribution to take the place of normal distribution by price competition.   This control of dis-tribution is no longer exercised by the Government but is entrusted to voluntary committees of the Trade, under Government supervision.(3) AH powers of control (apart from the Defence of the realm Regulations) expire on the 31st August   if the powers to control export and price cease to be exercised before that date, the power to control wages (apart from the [Defence of the Realm Regulations) lapses. 11 * B AS IS   OF     THE   R E C Elf T   WAGES     SETTLE-PIT,(4) The basis of the settlement of the reoent strike wasostensibly that the increase of wages then granted should vary with the proceeds of the industry.   Actually (pending*
an agreement between owners and mon for a pornanont system of wages adjustment) the variation was to depond not on ascertained proceod3 hut on the proceeds which might be expected to accrue, in the circumstances then existing, from increased output,, the whole of which would be available for export. In order to avoid the difficulties that wouldhave arisen in the selection of any arbitrary figure for tho calculation of the proceeds of the export sale of extra output the settlement was arrived at on the basis of the last available ascertained figurej   tho average export price during tho September quarter.   It was expected that, while this price (87/- f.o.b.) might not be maintained during the transition period, it was very improbable that tho average price would fall below 7l/6 at which price there would be no loss.As a stimulus to output tho settlement h:.s been an unqualified success.     Output during the September quarter W&apos;.&quot;-s at the rate of under 837,000,000 tons a year.   During the five weeks of tho first test period under the settlement it was at the rate of over 260,000,000 tons, and the men are entitled to another 1/6 a shift (making tho increase 0/6 a shift in all for the period 3rd - 151st   January),But this has boon accompanied by a sensational break in export prices;     tho average f*o.bf price (including current contracts) for November was 83/6,-for December it was 8l/s. For a sale mado at the present tine 65/- is a good price for largo coal, and 35/- for small coal which at tho time when the settlement was made would have fetched ISO/- and 85/-respootivoly.      In fact there &quot;is groat difficulty in obtaining offers for tho quantity of coal available.
4 r i4^4ill. FINANCIAL EFFECT OF TEE SgTTgMgNT,(7) Up to the end of September quarter the balance inthe &quot;pool&quot;, after meeting the standard profits and other charges was about  20,000,000.   The results of the December quarter are impossible to forecast with accuracyj   it is probable that the balance existing at the beginning of that quarter will not be materially altered, (8) But   during the quarter ending the 31st Kerch, withthe additional wages costs, the proceeds of the industry will not be sufficient to pay the guaranteed profits except In the unlikely event of the average f,o.b. export price being 7l/6 or over.   On the assumption that the whole of the surplus output is exported and that the price of inland . coal remains at its present figure, the deficiency below the guaranteed profits for the quarter may be roughly estimated as follows:-DeficiencyAverage ffo.b. priceof export coal and 260,000,000    252,000,000   244,000,000foreign bunkers. tons output    tons output   tons output3/6 extra       2/G oxtra      1/0 extra wage, wage. wage,7//6 Nil 2,450,000 4,900-, 00070/- 1,000,000 3,300,000 5,600,00060/- 8,000,000 9,300,000 10,600,00050/- 15,000,000 15,300,000 15,600,000It will thus be seen that the balance in the &quot;pool&quot; maybe dangerously near exhaustion at the end of the quarter. Assoon as it is exhausted the guarantee will have to be honoured .out of the Exchequer.IV.   ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF AVOIDING A SUBSIDY FROM THE EXGHEQDER.(9) Three possible alternative ways of meeting the situationhave to be considered:-(a) An increase in the price of home coal,(b) A reduction in wages.(c) Deoontrol of the industry.
These alternatives are not necessarily mutually exclusivo, but it will be best to examine each separately.ALTERNATIVE (a) - AH INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF HOME COAL.The increase in the average realised price of home coal which would be needed to bring the proceeds of the industry up to a point sufficient to cover the guaranteed standards during this quarter (bringing into account the current pro-oeeds of export coal but without trenching on the old 1!pool&quot;) my^^-estimted^appj^ximiateAy as follows Average f.o,b. priceof export coal and Increase needed inforeign bunkers, price of home coal.71/6 Nil. 70/- 5d.60/- 3/6J50/- 6/8On the other hand the increase required to revert to the policy adopted last May of fixing the price of home coal (which is roughly three-quarters of the coal sold) at a figure sufficient, on average, to cover costs of production, plus owners standard profits (leaving out of account the proceeds of export coal) would be 5/- to 6/- a ton.The arguments for and against this alternative may be summarised as follows Arguments for,(i) It is a step towards decontrol in that it tends to the restoration of tho ordinary economic conditions in the industry.(Li) It lessens the danger that the State may have to subsidise the industry out of the Exchequer in the period after the 31st March and tends to minimiso the extent to which the &quot;pool&quot; may have to be drawn upon in the quarter ending 31st Inarch.Arguments against.(i) To increase the price of coal by Government action
In the -present condition of the industry would be disadvantageous from a political point of view and might create very adverse oritioism. Hi) In view of the terms of the settlement of the strike and the sensitiveness that the men have always shown on the question of home prioes, it may introduce dis-oord into the wa.*es negotiations between the owners and the men.(iii) But the strongest argument against the proposal is the probability that it will be ineffective.     In the pre-sent relationship &quot;between supply and demand the coal owners are not.likely to be able to obtain substantially increased prioes, unless the new price is made a minimum price - which is unthinkable. ALTERNATIVE (b) - RiigUOg WAGES.The present system of regulating wages in accordance with outnut lasts till the 31st March, and tho owners and men have been told that it would be   quite impossible for the Government to aeree to its continuance beyond that date.     It may be expected therefore that the wages in April will be back to the September level - 3/6 a 3hift less than they are now (January).     But a more drastic out than this would be required, in the present state of trade, to relieve the Government from the likelihood of having to find money from the Exchequer to make up the owners guaranteed profits if the Goal Mines (Emergency) Act is to run to the 31st August.The arguments for and against this alternative may be summarised as follows :-Arguments forTheoretically, it is clearly the only sound course.   Not until wa-?es aro reduced in the coal mining industry can any real prosperity be restored not only to that industry but to
the industries of the country generally. Arguments against(a) A suggestion to reduce wages &quot;beyond any reduction that may result from the cessation of the temporary arrangement on the 1st iipril will he bitterly resisted by the men(and if       pressed may lead to a prolonged stoppage) for the following reasons(i) while the principle of periodical adjustments ofwages both up and down is perfectly well recognised in the industry, these adjustments have always been made on aspertained results.     There has always been a lag. Now it takes two months to ascertain the financial results of any cuarter.     In April, therefore, the latest quarter for whioh results will be available will be the last quarter of 1920 whioh is vitiated by the strike, or, failing that, the September quarter, in whioh the proceeds were not such as to justify any reduction in wages.(ii) Suoh a reduction of wages immediately following the experimental period will place the moderate men who supported the Government in Ootober in an extraordinarily difficult position and strengthen the hands of the extremists, who will represent it as a complete vindica-tion of the oaTcanny polioy and as being analagous to the practice, always denounced by the Government, of cutting rates as soon a&amp; the men increase out; ut.(b) If such a reduction in wages takes place during the currency of the Ooal nines (Emergency) Act the Government will bo Open to attack on the ground that they are cutting the Henrs wagej while still guaranteeing the owners1   profits.
(14),   ALTERNATIVE M DECONTROL OF THE INDUS IKY,The only form of decontrol which can e-ffc-(rtxTely release tho Exchequer from its obligations is the removal of what has been called above the &quot;incidental&quot; control of profits.     Before examining- rthe question how soon it is practicable to attempt a   removal of the incidental Control it ia necessary to considor how far the reasons still exist which necessitated the primary control of home prices and of export.(IS)   DECONTROL OF PRICES AMD EXPORT,It has been mentioned above that the reason of control lay in the fact that, without it, the &quot;pull&quot; of the world price, accentuated by the low British output, would have left  us with insufficient coal for our inland needs, or have brought the home price up to the world price.    But a complete change has come about in the last few weeks in the following respects:-(a) &apos;      British output during the five test weeks was practically back at the pre-war rate (excluding the bumper years 1911 and 1913).(b) America is in a position to deliver coal.at about 13 dollars o.i.f. (say 7C-/-) in European Ports and is giving long credits.(c) France is glutted with American and German coal.The Scandinavian countries are stocked up and are buying only in small quantities.     Italy cannot afford to buy largely at present prices.     The Argentine market is for the time lost by us to America.(d) Owing to the dopression in trade the home industrial demand has greatly diminished.   A large number of collieries are working short time owing to lack of trade.(10)
(e) The restriction on export is, for the time being, inoperative, as foreign markets cannot be found for the whole amount permitted to be exported.    Indeed It has been found neoessary already practically to free export and entirely to remove tfre restrictions on bunkering.(f) IChe controlled pithead price is from 22/- to 45/- according to quality.     The pithead price for export ooal cannot be stated with accuracy;   it is perhaps from 25/- to 60/-.    It certainly shows that approximation to inland prices which has always been reoognised as the criterion for determining the time at which decontrol might safely be attempted.Xt is difficult to-forecast the course cf home prices if they are freed.     The present prices are not paying prices, and ooal owners will oertainly try to raise them. On the other hand the slump in export prices and the in.-creased output, which tend to throw coal into the inland mrrkot, should work the other way.    Competition for a market will take the place of the present artificial system of distribution.    Economies will result from decontrol and consumers.will be able to get more suitable qualities of fuel*    The Departments trade advisers are of opinion that the average increase of prioe under decontrol would be less than the amount that would be required, under a continuance of control, to raise the prioe of home ooal to a figure sufficient to cover, on average, costs of production, plus owners1 standard profits.    The price of the poorer qualities of ooal, which are largely used for industrial purposes are not likely to rise, Indeed they will probably fall.       .The largest Increase would probably be in domestic ooal for places furthest removed from the coalfields, e/g. London, the(11]
The Arguments for and against the decontrol of prioe and export may be summarised as follows:-Argument a forThat control, should be removed as speedily as possible is in oonsonanco with the ahole policy of the Government and the genoraX-oVemand of the country;   it is particUl&amp;r^L^ in the-pre-a^nt-very delicatecottmcroial position of the-Indus try, that it should be able itself to deal with the daily adjustments which that position necessitates.   The only question is as to the woight of the arguments against. Arguments against(i) So far as decontrol of price means an increase of price arguments (i) and fii] (para 11) against an increase in the c-on**\ trolled price apply, though with less forces(ii) Immediate decontrol of price means   the selection of the most difficult time cf the. jear for tho substitution of competitive distribution for artificial distribution.A certain amount of confusion is bound to arise during the: transition period.j This could be minimised by giving ample notice - say a month).(iii) There ?I11 be a certain risk of home prices rising in order to keep coal in the oountryif the export market recovers.(But this is a risk that must be faced when-over decontrol takes place and foreign competition may be relied on to oorrect it). &apos;(iv) Wages directions given under the. Mining Industry Act, and the Power to give new, directions under that Act automatically expire with decontrol of prices and export before there is any permanent scheme to take their pIpcp.(12)
(This is perhaps an academic rather than 46a real objection.     The present Wages Agreement must remain, whether under legal direction or not, until the 31st March).(v)    Anxiety to get back into foreign markets might lead to certain classes of coal required in Great Britain being exported.(This again is a risk that must be taken whenever decontrol takes place, and the present increased output and reduction in export minimise it), (vi)     Between the date of the announcement and the date ofdecontrol there may be a tendency for merchants to hold up domestic coal in order to realise higher prices after decontrol for their accumulated stocks.(This objection could only be completely met by the announcement being accompanied by an increase in the controlled price, which is open to obvious objection. Short of that it is necessary to rely (a) on the fact that current output has to be disposed of somehow;   it cannot be held up at the collieries and merchants cannot put more than a limited amount on the ground:   (b) on persuading the Merchants&apos; Federation to see that their members &apos;play the game1;   and (c) on the Profiteering Act).IB)       It is the unanimous opinion of the Departments Trade Advisers that decontrol of price ought to take place, and Can safely take place, provided that a month&apos;s notice is given.DECONTROL OF PROFITS. 19)       We can now examine the question when decontrol of profits * is practicable.     Inasmuch as to effect it at any date earlier than the 31st August will need either an Order underSection 3 of the Mining Industry Act (which has to be approvedi
by resolution of both Houses of Parliament) or a Statute, it is important if possible to secure the assent of the coalowners .to any course that may be proposed.(20) While the owners would welcome, and the men wouldprobably not seriously resist, early decontrol of price and export, both are strongly against early decontrol, of profits.(21) The owners oppose it with the argument that theGovernment took over the industry in a solvent condition and it is inequitable for them to hand it back in anything but a solvent condition.     Fear the reasons alreadv ex-plained, they regard it as quite impossible to secure an adequate reduction in wages before the 1st July.     Earlier decontrol would, they say, result in a period of chaos in which large numbers of pits, and even whole districts would have to close down because there is not enough money in the industry to tide them over the unproductive period.     Moreover the poorer districts-  such as Lancashire, the Forest of Dean, Bristol and Somerset- make no secret of their desire to perpetuate the pooling of profits indefinitely.
463(22) The men oppose it for two reasons;(a) they no doubt think that the continuance of guaranteed profits means the continuance of high wages;(b) they attach supreme importance to securing, as an outcome of their negotiations with the owners, some permanent scheme of pooling under which, by means of a levy on profits in the rich districts, the poor districts may he able to keep up to a level of wages approximatlfcf to that of the rich.     In this they will almost certainly prove unsuccessful.     But they will never willingly agree to the termination of the present pooling, system unless there is some other pooling scheme to take its place.(23) On the other hand it is probably necessary to accept theview of the coalowners that any attempt to continue the pooling scheme of the Coal Mines (Emergency) Act without continuing also a, guarantee of profits is impracticable.-(24) Since it is unlikely that any liability will fall onthe Exchequer under the Coal Mines (Emergency) Act before the 31st March, it is unnecessary to consider the possibility of decontrol of profits before that date;   Indeed earlier decontrol would hardly be practicable in view of the necessity4 of parliamentary action.(25) The arguments may now be discussed for and against&apos;terminating the Coal Mines (Emergency) Act (a) on the 31st- . Marth and (b) on some date later than the 31st March but earlier than the 31st August.DECONTROL   OF   PROFITS,   ON   51st   MARCH. (26)   ARGUMENTS FOR:-(a) it safeguards the Exchequer.(b) a period of some confusion is sure to follow decontrol.-    The longer the time, that the(lo)
424industry has in which to settle down &quot;before next winder the better* ^ ARGUMENTS AGAINST(a) It will be opposed by both men and owners (though neither are probably quite unanimous in their opposition) &apos; and there may be Parliamentary difficulties in doing it.(b) It will mean that the decision to decontrol tho Industry, and not improbably the actual step of decontrol also, will be taken before an agreement has been arrived at between owners and men for the future regulation of wages.(o) It is the contention of the owners (taking the view thatno substantial out in wages is possible before July) that for three months the industry as a whole, and the greater part of its component districts and oollieries individually, will be working at a loss.   It is said that during this period a large number of pits must stop production, and widespread unemployment result, together with a serious falling off in output and violent fluctuations of price; and that the consequent ohaos would involve the country in greater eventual loss than would the continuance of the guarantee.27) The force of this last contention depends on factors which are quite unknown *   The degree of acuteness of the orisis obviously depends on the prices that may be then realisable for home and export coal which there is no means of forecasting; the degree af difficulty that the industry will havo in surmounting the crisis depends on its existing financial resources, which there is no moans of ascertaining^, ,(28)        Tho fell owing illustrations may bo given of&apos;what would be the position of the industry during this period if the output were at the rate of 250,,000^000 tons a year, wages and costs were at tho
465September level, and all ooal were sold at the present home prices.(29) On these assumptions two districts only would be making a profit - Notts, and Derby with a profit of 4/lla ton, and Yorkshire with a profit of 3/6.   The lossesper ton in the other districts would be as follows:-Stafford, Shropshire, Warwick &amp; Worcester,      3dGloucester, Somerset, Kent and the forestof Dean, * 104I^rham, l/VNorthumberland, 2/10Scotland, 3/8Lancashire, Cheshire and North Wales, 3/south Wales. 5/l0Cumberland, lO/ll,Over tho country es a whole the loss would averagel/2 a ton.(30) But the assumptions on which this is based are, ofcourse, very gloomy.,   In particular it may be regarded as certain that, onoe oontrol is removed, there will be a sharp decline in costs and it is not at all unlikely that there will be some recovery in the export market in the spring.,   The above calculations assume a pithead price of 33/2 for export ooal.,   Export pithead prices cf 42/4, 37/5 and 48/8 would wipe out tho loss in Northum-berland, Durham and South Wales respectively.DECONTROL Off PROfflTS Aff A DATE LAgjjR THAN tkb 31st MAROH.(3l) The obvious argument in favour of this is that the shorter the interval between the date of decontrol and the date when wages can be reduced, the less is the risk of a serious financial orisis in the industry.   The obvious arguments against it are that the longer oontrol Is continued the greater   is the risk of the guarantee.
466falling on the Exchequer, and the shorter is the period that tho industry has in -which tc settle down before the winter,32) In estimating the risk to th^ Bscchequor wef areagain in the rsulm cf pure conjectures   It depends on the following factors, all of whioh are quite unknown -(a) the balance loft in the &quot;pool&quot; on tha 31at March;(b) Output;   (0)   Prices end   (d)   coats.ill that can be said with certainty is that (apart from any question of wages rates) costs will tend con-stantly to rise during the remaining period of control. 33) It may, however, bo worth whilo to give two illustro-tions based on hypothetical daiia.   Both leave out of account tho possibility of relief from a credit balance in the &quot;pool&quot; on the 31st of March,A.   The first takes evicting figures of output and-prices, the rate of airport contemplated in the wages settlement, and the wages and costs of the September quarter, 1*0*,output gGO^COO^OOO tons a year.prices (home   -   33/2do(export,   50/-  v.o*b*export and bunkers,     54,,OCOJ000 tons a year.On this vtoasis the monthly deficit below the nine-tenths standards would bo  ?00.000 and variations in the data would produce tho following variations in tho deficit(i)   For every l/- variation in homo prices (oth*r data being qp shown abovo) tho monthly deficit would vary by  750,000,(ii) i?or ovary l/- variation in oxport priooe (other data being as nhown abovo) tho monthly deficit would vary by  225,0004(iii)   for every decrease of 250,000 tons a .month in export quantities (other datelv being as shown above) the monthly deficit would increase by  85,000.
