His Britannic Mcijastjr Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.SECRET.4 1 * ; ) coam from Viceroy, Home Department, to Secretary of State for India,dated SOth December 1920.Following is weekly telegram : Week has been relatively quiet, politicians waiting on Congress meeting. Brief Press report of Congress received shows 22,000 delegates present, with many visitors. Prominent Congressmen attended. Great enthusiasm prevailed on opening day, though some disorder and confusion, and in &quot; Subjects &quot; discussion, afterwards, more disorder, e.g., in Bengal delegates&apos; camp a scuffle occurred in which some delegates were slightly injured, majority being opposed to programme relating to boycott of educational institutes. General &quot; Subjects Committee &quot; meeting of yesterday engaged in animated discussion of Gandhi&apos;s resolution for change of Congress creed, i.e., attainment of Swaraj by all legitimate and peaceful means. Report current that while moderate thinkers against change, other party would go much further, advocating republic in India. - Sub-committee&apos;s recommendation, embodying important portions of Gandhi&apos;s resolution, eventually carried by large majority. Outstanding points in Presidents opening speech on the 20th, that people of India must demand fulfilment of original compact, by which rulers bound to give full responsible government, by instrument in writing, including declaration of fundamental rights, and constitution similar to United Kingdom and dominions. British system of parliamentary responsibility in his view best, which should be created immediately in India by letters patent or instructions to Secretary of State; he characterised statement in preamble of the Government of India Act, 19.19, that it was for the British Parliament to grant responsible government, and that British Government must judge time and measure of gradual - steps proposed in this behalf, as a preposterous and extraordinary claim which Parliament could not advance. Dealing with non-co-operation, maintained that Gandhi&apos;s movement violated no constitution, whereas British system of administration (is) based on non-co-operation of conqueror against conquered. As to items in programme (corrupt group) considered renunciation-tion of titles small matter and renunciation of honorary offices should not include surrender of magistracies or judgeships. As pledges of Reforms Scheme were questionable boycott, of elections could not be regretted. Indicated the dangers of non-co-operation: (1) Discipline imposed should not imply absolute surrender of private judgment; (2) propaganda carried on should not create great animosities, eg., between advocates and opponents of non-co-operation.In favour of British connection if compatible with honour, or on equal terms. Examined the alleged Indian grievances : (1) Repressive legislation. (2) Punjab disturbances. (3) Khalifat. (4) Treatment of Indians in Colonies. (5) Inadequate reforms. Thought non-co-operation the proper weapon to use to secure from England fulfilment of these demands, but objected to boycott of educationaHnstitutions and to withdrawal lawyers from practice. Arbitration Courts could not supersede organised tribunals. Described his own programme as nation building in earnest, to be effected by developing and perfecting the Congress organisation so as to bring about unification of people and the establishing and augmenting national spirit by educating the masses, collecting large funds and empowering special committee to look after different lines of activity, but attached also greatest importance to (two corrupt groups) of the questions, namely, to employ(ment) (of) means of converting not only the personnel of the Executive Government but also non-official English exploiters to new angle of vision. There is little to report from the Provinces, latest reports received dealing with events prior to Congress. Bengal report intimidation of voters during elections mainly confined to general appeals, though some students interfering with voters had to be arrested and afterwards released with warning. Small polling among Mohamedan electorate due to apathy and obscur(ity of) Mohamedan candidates as much as to non-co-operation. Situation in schools and colleges steadily improving and indications that parents exerting authority. Gandhi and Shaukat Alps tour before Congress fell extremely flat and doubtful if enough subscriptions raised to pay for trip. Gandhi opened National Institution on day of arrival, but effect of speech little, and Muhammad Ali&apos;s open avowal of intention to 3041     100 1.21
destroy existing schools and colleges before others ready frightened extremists and provoked protest (? from) Amrita Bazar Pair ilia newspaper. Non-co-operation in practice may be said to be dead in Bengal; Gandhi is regarded with veneration, hut his programme regarded with tolerance extended to children^ games.. Wedgwood interviewed extremist leaders in Calcutta, but advice not palatable and Wedgwood viewed with a certain amount of suspicion by Bengali politicians, In Central Provinces somewhat more political activity than usual during last fortnight owing to Congress at Nagpur. In some districts paid lecturers employed to disseminate non-co-operation and attempts made to spread movement to villages, but met with little success and pleaders refuse to surrender practice. Some manifestations of a little unrest at some schools at a few centres, but as yet there has been no real response to the call of boycott.Jinnah, addressing students of Fergusson College, Bombay, while a believer in non-co-operation, expressed view Gandllis move premature and programme harmful and impracticable in present state of political consciousness, and urged students to take no active part in politics, fvhaparde also issued a memorandum on non-co-operation showing avoidance of contract with de facto Government affords no training ground for development of political sense, and while it may strengthen power of endurance cannot breed energy or resourcefulness or practical wisdom.A report of Conference of peasant delegates from United Provinces shows growing strength of agrarian movement referred to in previous weekly telegram. Resolutions condemning landlords&apos; high-handedness, pressing for complete deletion of ejectment laws from Statute Book, approving special Congress non-co-operation, and urging (V repeal) (? grant) of mortgage and sale right in peasant holdings,. Avere passed.Appointment of Chintamani and Sapru well received except in extremist circles, but selected Ministers in Madras criticised on ground that persons selected represent only one communal section. Appointment of Executive Councils of four members in Bombay and Madras also criticised.We have received a copy of a communique issued by Bihar and Orissa Govern-ment on events in Champaran and are forwarding a copy by mail.
