IBSTRIOTION OF qV7 K.;If31IT CONTRACTS TO FI3MSCP^ 3 r OH GB5 KIHCS ItOItt.M:mirandura &quot;by the Postmaster General^(Previous Papers      CP. 2265. 2424 and 2426).I fear the rule proposed by tho Minister ofLabour in his momoranGnm of December 7th. (CP.2265), thatGovernment Contracts should be restrioted to Firms on thoKing&apos;s Roll, &quot;cula be un-orkabla without a large number ofq u al i f i c at i on s an u e r:o ep ti ons.A considerable number of Firms tendering for PostOffice Contracts, who are not yet on the Eing&apos;s 5oll, statethat they are in negotiation with the Ministry of labour,either individually or through their. Trade Association, fora reduction of the percentage of disabled men required asqualification, and it will probably bo some time before allthese cases are definitely settlod.    For example, theMinistry of Labour are understood to be still in negotiationpith the Engineering trade and several Firms state thattheir position is undo-ttttorioa fo$&apos;)tMti&apos;-*6ti8on,Apart from this, exceptions would have to bo made to meet tho following oases - -(l) Small Firms employing only a feu persons;(2) Businesses in whioh the work or the bulk of it is proper to female labour;(?) Businesses whore tho work is too laborious or risky for disabled men?(4) r;hore it is necessary to supplement tho suppllos from enrolled Firms owing to their combined output boing ^ inadequate;(5) IThere none of the Firms tendering for a particular article are on the King&apos;s Soil, or --here specialities of foreign manufacture are purchased from British agents;( 6) 510 r e s 0 r u e r e d ab r c a d.
Thore are also a for; oases where the only tenderer on the Kingrs Roll quotes a price far above  -competitors who aro not on tha Roll.    Some latitude to exclude unreasonably high tenders would be essential.In tho 5 months ending November last, 87$ of the Post Offioo ocntraots exceeding  500 in value wore given to Firms upon tha King&apos;s Roll, and this percentage will no ,doubt rise as the number of oases under negotiation with the Ministry of labour is reduced.     QJhe practical effect of a rigid rule disqualifying Firms not on the Roll for Government contracts would therefore be in the aggregate inconsiderable.    On the other hand unless so many exceptions wero admitted as to make the rule more or less illusory, thoro would be serious difficulty in obtaining supplies of a certain number of.articles for whioh, fair one reason or another, suitable tenders from firms on tho Roll cannot bo obtained.(Sd.)   ALBERT H. ILUHGWORTH.General Post. Offioo. January 5th. 1921.
