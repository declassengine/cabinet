As far a?? I can gather the applications we have received have been for schemes that had all been arranged before our Committee was appointed.&apos;f&apos;e shall no doubt get plenty of applications soon but we are at present waiting for schemes to reach us.   It is possible that the fact we can only give 30$ of the cost of labour may be preventing applications but so far we have little if any evidence of thissMy Committee is a really excellent one and. full of zeal for work.     Should the Government feel inclined to enlarge our powers or give us any additional tasks we shall be quite ready to take them on.Yours sincerely, (Sgd)   St, Davids.P..3:5   So far we have only voted away about  30,000 of our  3,000,000 and   2, 000 to 2,100 men should be getting employment under our gr&amp;iru3*     I am sending a copy&apos;of this to the Minister for Labour,(Initialled)   St, %
