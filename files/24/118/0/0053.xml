This n^nm-nt is the Property of &quot;^77^ Government,3Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.245?gram from Viceroy, Home Department, to Secretary of Slate for India,hied (Jth January .1.921.following is -weekly telegram : Some of more important Press comments on Presidents speech at Congress, of which summary telegraphed last week : Times of india.-&apos;Vhe address leaves on the mind an (V ineffaceable) impression of courage without knowledge, patriotism without experience. It is instinct with the intellectual ferment now abroad untutored by any practical experience of the conditions of national growth and progress.Bombay Chronicle. Embodiment of a considered philosophy of politics. Causes of discontent dissected, remedy suggested, and need of maintaining the right and humane attitude of mind which will stimulate and help effort of nature to release generous energies of our people urged.Adcocate of India.-Speech could not be pleasing to followers of Gandhi. Mr. Achariar has always been credited with a certain amount of courage, and he has lived up to his reputation by boldly denouncing Gandhi&apos;s impossible programme.Justice. Arguments against non-co-operation, such as preached by Gandhi,, could not be received with rapt attention, not because they were unsound and illogical, but because the crowd that follows a fanatic would have no patience for arguments of the kind advanced by President.Tribune. Address masterly performance. If British statesmanship knows its duty, it will immediately avail itself of opportunity, and eagerly grasp hand extended by President. To extreme non-co-operator address may indeed be profoundly disappointing.Amrita Bazar Palrika. Bold and statesmanlike utterance with a ring of sincerity and earnestness. His anxiety to avoid a split and secure the harmonious co-operation of all parties is shared by all who have the best interests of the country at heart. He has given the best advice according to his light, and we have no doubt the delegates will give due weight to the views of one who has a long and distinguished service to the country to his credit.Discussions in Congress centred round proposed main resolutions: First,, involving change in Congress creed by deletion of reference to British connection, and, second, declaring intention of Congress to put in force whole or any part of scheme of non-co-operation from renunciation of voluntary association with present Government to refusal of payment of taxes at a time to be determined by either-Indian National Congress or All-India Congress Committee. In moving^the first resolution, namely, that the object of the Congress is the attainment of &quot; Swaraj &quot; by the people of India by all legitimate and. peaceful means, Gandhi said that wording-was open to both interpretations, id est, Swaraj &quot; within or without the British Empire to be determined by the nature of such connection in the attainment of &quot;Swaraj &quot;for India and the redress of the Punjab and. Moslem grievances. Reso-lution was a very elastic one, which could oiler a platform for the two views. It was derogatory to. national dignity to think of permanence of British connection at any cost. British Government not only refuses to redress wrongs under which Indians suffer, but declines to acknowledge her mistakes. India could not possibly have British connection il British people will not do elementary justice. Did not for one moment suggest that they wanted such British connection at all costs unconditionally. If British connection was for the advancement of India, they did not want to destroy it; but if British connection inconsistent with national self-respect, then bounden duty to destroy it. As to methods of obtaining &quot;Swaraj,&quot; urged non-violence and soul force. Lala Lajpat Rai attacked British statesmen, asking who is there in British Cabinet in whom India has faith and whether there was a British commonwealth in real sense. Said it would be better to die than to be a partner in a blood-stained Empire. Admitted armed rebellion was ont of the question, but concluded there-was nothing impossible for a nation of 300,000,000 to achieve in manly and fearless way. Jinnah opposed resolution. He said India could not achieve independence f -j. without bloodshed.   Resolution was a declaration which, though India had the willI [* to adopt, she had not the means to carry out.   It was a &quot; camouflage &quot; which did not give any definite idea about British, connection. 3104     100  1.21 A
2. He opposed resolution, first, because complete independence was demanded without any instructions to the country, and, secondly, because lie believed India could not secure such independence by bloodless means. He appealed to Gandhi, as a man commanding majority delegates, to halt before taking hazardous step of changing resolution, lie was constantly heckled during speech, which was ill received. Pal whole-heartedly supported resolution, but thought Swaraj might be defined by addition of word &quot; Democratic&quot; as warning against trend of modern Imperialism to consolidate white races. Wedgwood opposed resolution, criticised want of fair play and treatment meted out to Jinnah and in Subjects Committee to Malaviya and Sir H. Goudhri. Swaraj should be a democratic Swaraj and not autocracy; warned audience that change in constitution would make it difficult, if. not impossible, for friends in England to work for them. Resolution was carried by overwhelming majority. As to second resolution, regarding means whereby Swaraj may be realised, considerable discussion in Subjects Committee and. notice of several amendments. Ultimately unity was secured and Das&apos;s resolution accepted. This resolution, which was subsequently carried at sitting of Congress alter all amend-ments had been withdrawn, was to following effect: Existing Government of India forfeited confidence country. People India determined establish Swaraj. Methods adopted by them prior special sessions failed secure due recognition, rights and liberties, and redress of many wrongs. Congress, while reaffirming resolution of non-violent non-co-operation, declares that entire or any part or parts of scheme, with renunciation of voluntary association with present Government at one end, and refusal to pay taxes at other, should be put in force at a time to be determined by either Indian National Congress or All-India Congress Committee, and that in meanwhile, to prepare country for it, effective steps should continue to be taken in that behalf.(A) Calling on parents and guardians of school children, not children them-selves, under age of 10 to make greater efforts for purpose of withdrawing them from Government-aided schools, and to provide training in National Schools.(B) Calling on students of 16 and over to withdraw without delay, irrespective of consequences, from Government schools if they feel against their conscience to continue in such schools, and to devote themselves to special non-co-operation service.(Cj Calling on trustees, managers and teachers of Government schools to help nationalise them.(D) (Jailing on lawyers to make greater efforts to suspend practice.(E) In order to make India economically independent, calling on merchants to carry out gradual boycott of foreign trade relations, and having a scheme of economic boycott planned and formulated by a committee of experts.(F) ^Calling for utmost possible contribution of help sacrifice towards national movement.(G) Organising committees in village or group of villages, with central provincial organisations, to accelerate progress non-co-operation.- (H) Organising band national workers for a service to be called, the Indian National Service by taking effective steps to raise national fund for purpose of financing the foregoing national service and non-co-operation movement.Proceeds. Congress congratulates nation on progress made, and claims new&apos; Councils do not represent, country ; trusts those elected, in spite of deliberate abstention from polls of overwhelming majority, will resign their seats, and if they retain them, electors will studiously refrain from asking political service from them. Recognises growing friendliness between police and soldiers and people, and hopes former will refuse to subordinate country to the fulfilment of orders of their officers. Special emphasis laid on non-violence as integral part of resolution, and. impresses on people non-violence in word and deed essential. Finally, in order to establish Swaraj within one year, urges ail. bodies to devote exclusive attention to promotion non-violence and non-co-operation, to advance Hindu-Muslim unity, to settle disputes between Brahmins and non-Brahmins, and to make special efforts to rid Hinduism of reproach of untouchability. In moving the resolution, Das denied a charge that non-co-operation passed in the Subjects Committee Avas weaker and not stronger than resolution passed at special session at Calcutta. In latter, no clear declaration that nation was resolved to put in force entire scheme. Believed that that may not be necessary, but, if necessary, people of India will not shrink. Gandhi, supporting resolution, said there had been absolutely no violation of obligation Congress,
resolution did not find a nian&apos;s conscience, though he felt that the majority were of opinion that he held, would revise the party by making Congress itself a fetish, and in its mandate declared that they were not tampering with obligations of service imposed on employees of Government, civil, military and police, but asking them not to kill their conscience, lu this resolution they would forget all differences and acrimony that had ground their public life during last three months, B. C. Pal said he had never been against the principle and policy of non-co-operation, though he might have had differences in regard to some of details. Supported resolution, and said differences must be merged in the united cause. Lajpat liai also supported resolution, which he claimed had removed all objections without weakening in any of essentials.3. Whilst extremist Press expresses jubilation at maintenance of unity, fact that both resolutionf? s were) eompromise(d), and existence of strong minority at Congress are not desired. Further, non-co-operation resolution seems to indicate clearly that impracticability of non-co-operation, at any rate in regard to schools and suspension of practice by lawyers, is recognised. This being so, and as boycott of Councils is no longer living issue, it remains to be seen in what direction, apart from general vilification of Government, activities of. Gandhi and his supporters will now be turned.4. Other resolutions. Congress extended hearty support to Indians, East Africa,, and   South Africa, in struggle against treatment East Africa and South Africa Government. Approved policy peaceful non-co-operation initiated by Indians, East Africa. Considered helplessness of nation in matter of treatment of Indians in British dominions overseas clear demonstrations of necessity for non-co-operation. Placed on record grateful appreciation valuable services rendered by Andrews in cause Indians indentured in Fiji and elsewhere. Condemned Government for callous disregard needs Indian people in regard to exportation foodstuffs. Bomanji moved resolution for boycott Duke Comiaught/s visit, explaining no wish to show disrespect to Royal Family, but to call upon people who take part in Congress to refrain from being present at any functions or festivities in connection with visit. Currency policy of Government vigorously attacked by Bomanji. President moved resolution that Board Congress Committee and paper India be abolished, and another paying homage to memory McSwiney and sympathising with Ireland in struggle for independence. Moslem League held under presidency Ansari, who gave account of work Khilafat Delegation in Europe. Referred to obdurate statesman of Europe who would not yield an inch. Dwelt on Khilafat and Punjab wrrongs and methods by which they should be redressed, spirit behind which has to be fought and conquered. Attributes conduct Great Britain to notion of superiority of West over East, and said question was therefore not only one of India&apos;s honour, but struggle for emancipation of enslaved Asiatics from thraldom of West. Therefore advocates non-co-operation as laid down by Gandhi, justifying it as a Divine injunction imposed in Muslim Shariat. Mohamed Ali moved. Objects Muslim League be: (a) Attainment Swaraj by people India by all legitimate and peaceful means; (6) to protect in advance political, religious and other rights and interests Indian Mussalmans; (c) to promote friendship and union between Mussalmans and other communities India ; (d) to maintain and promote brotherly relations between Moslems India and those other countries throughout the world. Change in creed inevitable, and as India had not means to fight, word &quot; peacefulwas essential. Hasrat Mohini said time might come when violence would be required, and received support from others. Mohamed Ali said words of resolution in conformity with existing situation, and if circumstances changed, creed may be changed accordingly. On motion Kitchlew, League adopted resolution calling on Indians to increase efforts attainment Swaraj, save soldiery from moral degradation which would result from utilisation Indian arms to advance aggressive qualities British conquest as expressed by Esher Committee. Non-co-operation adopted, also-resolution appealing to Hindus to refrain from obtaining cow protection through Legislation. Before formally dissolving, resolution passed requesting Amir Amanullah. to reject peace or alliance with British Government as Indians had no quarrel with Afghanistan, and as such Britain had opposed Khilafat and such an alliance was not conceived as a plea for protecting India, but for strengthening hold on country.5. We have not seen any Hindu comments on this resolution, but it can hardly he doubted that it would be as bitter to their taste as that on cow protection, 3104 A 2
6, All-India Liberal federation lielcl in Madras under presidency Chintamini., Large gathering delegated from all parts India. Chintamini, whilst vigorously condemning non-co-operatioii nioveinenl and Swaraj resolution of Congress, described recommendations of Esher Committee as reactionary and objectionable, and criticised strongly Rowlatt committee&apos;s Report. Appealed to Government to take advantage of development in Greece and revise Turkish Treaty and soothe the heart of Punjab. Declared that military policy would be a test of their sincerity. Liberal party was real centre party ; it was all for reforms, but was content with steady, though slow, progress. Claimed that it had gained ground in country and that increasing numbers joining, whilst extremists&apos; party was fast losing hold acquired over popular mind. Resolutions were carried welcoming Ills Royal Highness the Duke of Coniiaught and appointment of Lord Sinha as Governor of Uihar and Orissa, protesting against recommendations of Esher Committee and against disabilities enforced on Indians in East Africa, urging appointment of Commission to examine fiscal policy. Resolu-tions moved by Sastri were also carried, protesting against failure of Government to render justice by imposing inadequate punishments upon officers guilty of acts of cruelty, &amp;c., during martial law administration in Punjab, and calling for abolition of all distinctions in law based on race.7. Reports from provinces : Bihar and Orissa. Gandhi&apos;s hurried tour prior to Congress did not satisfy expectations of promoters. At Arrah, Patua, gave reception by no means whole-hearted, and at Arrah and Gaya meetings very nearly fiascos. Attended by large numbers, people being stirred by his reputation for unworldly conduct, but his principles so little understoood that his meeting at Arrah stimulated recruitment for the Army. Tone of speeches delivered Patna unexpectedly mild, and at Darbhanga disclaimed connection with or approval of Swami Biclyanand, leader of Kisan Sabha movement. At Monghyr and Bhagalpur he had more success. Non-co-operation had some spurious success in urban areas, hut in rural areas effect produced surprisingly small, though campaign vilification of Government, continued indefinitely, will poison the minds of common people. Trouble is still smouldering in the coalfields, but no immediate general strike probable. Wedgwood and Lajpat Rai, visiting recently, laid stress on thorough organisation before strike attempted, and that strike weapon not to be used except for very strong reasons.Bombay. Lull in political activities continues, interest centring in Congress -deliberations at Nagpur.   Reported seven members of Meinon community resigning posts of Justice of the Peace and one a title, under social pressure.   Bomanjiresigned Justice of Peace-ship and two other titles.   Despatch of Government of India on position of Indians East Africa on the whole well received.United Provinces. Lull here also after activity during elections and diversion caused by Nagpur Congress. Set-back received by non-co-operators at Benares and Aligarh weakened the (? cause). Moderates organising movement against non-co-operation by establishing Liberal or Reform Leagues ; supporters non-co-operation, actually GanclhLs lecturers, penetrating to smaller villages. National schools started in a few districts, but no promise of lasting vitality. Ganclhi&apos;s visit to Partabgarh shows tenants not interested in non-co-operation in itself. Real grievance in Oudh, at any rate, is uncontrolled ejectment.Punjab. Lull in political agitation since elections. Cases reported of attempts to boycott voters and others who took part in elections and fracas at Panipat, hut security proceedings under section 107, Code of Criminal Procedure, prevented trouble and had good effect. A few Panchayats started to dispose of petty cases without reference to courts. In Sikh districts where politicians penetrated situation bad, anyone aiding Government being socially boycotted, and propaganda in villages on increase, though position in localities free from extremist agitators satisfactory. Application of Seditious Meetings Act has had good effect, and declaration of Govern-ment of India applying Act to certain other districts of Lahore and Jullundur has had sobering effect, though Local Government not yet proclaimed these districts. Postmen have been on strike, and some inconvenience caused. Arrangements made to continue delivering letters.Assam. Students of Murari Chanel College, Sylhet, decided to send delegates to &quot; All India Colleges Students&apos; Conference&quot; at Nagpur, and passed resolution that they were not opposed to principle of non-co-operation but, in absence of National
% &quot;Colleges, considered it inadvisable to leave government institutions.   They asserted this attitude towards authorities not.disrespectful,Delhi. A public apology lias been tendered to Imam at Junia Masjid for demonstration against him reported in weekly telegram dated 7th May 1920.Asa I! Ali, who acted as men&apos;s representative in recent strike in Delhi Electric Light and Tramways Company, has outlined scheme of forming every kind of Panchayat and Trade Union, and of establishing friendly relations therewith, by fomenting successful strikes and negotiations for increase of pay. When Union in full working order, to be employed to conduct social boycott of opponents of non-co-operation.North-West Frontier Province. Bomb was thrown about one o clock on 28th December into compound of Indian clergymen attached to Mission Church near the Kohati (late in Peshawar city. Two children, slightly damaged. Bomb was of lead moulded over a tin, and cut criss-cross, and apparently locally made.General. Except lor Congress and Moslem League, there has been distinct lull in activity. Appointment of Sundar Siujli Majithia has disappointed a section of opinion in Punjab, but elsewhere selections of Ministers appear to have been well, received by moderate opinion.We send by mail an appendix to Congress Presidents address, consisting of draft of Constitution of Dominion of British India with Declaration of Rights.
