0 A 3 I N g T.NAVAL SITUATION IN TTIg BALTICMemorandum by the. First Lord of the Admiralty.I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, a sumnary of a despatch dated 15th December 1920 from the British Commissioner in the Baltic Provinces addressed to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs relative to the services rendered by the Royal Navy in the Baltic.2.      In this connection I may observe that our policy is to reduce the Naval force in the Baltic to sim 11 dimensions during the winter, when days are short and ice is prevalent, and to increase its strongth to a Li $it Squadron of four or five ships in the spring should the situation make this necessary. The intention is that this squadron should make two cruises of about six weeks1 duration round the Baltic, one in the spring and one in the autumn.      It is not proposed, however, to maintain a permanent force in the Baltic v/hen conditons have returned to the normal.(intdO   V/. H. L.
Summary of   a dospat oh dated 15.13*20 from Mr.&apos; ttaTjjrrbs IrTOsn^oimBsloner for the galtlo, &apos; &apos; ProVihoes aoTduessetTTo      15ecre5ary of State, &quot;ToFToreign  Tfairs..In Ivlaroa 1919 the Navy supplied the only saf o foothold, for a British representative in the Baltic provinces and his presence ashore at Libau in the midst of von der Goltz s troops was only ma.de tolerable by thepresence of British ships.Effective assistance to Latvia had begun to be  $ven in January 1919 when H.M.S. &quot;0AL3DON&quot; successfully bombarded Windau than occupied by Bolsheviks.The Esthonian Government at Reval attributed their repulse of the Bolsheviks at the beginning of the year to the arrival of a British Naval Force.   This force also captured the two Bolshevik destroyers &quot;Spartak&quot; and &quot;Avtroil&quot;, and handed thorn over to the Esthonian Govern-ment when they were immediately used against the Bolsheviks in landing operations which led directly to the expulsion of &quot;red&quot; troops from Estonia^In April 1919 K.M.Ships afforded a refuge to members of the Lettish Government in Libau when the German and Bait coup d etat took place, and it was to the fact that this refuge was available that the re-establishment in June of Mr Ulmanis1 Government must be attributed.   At this  time it is very doubtful if the Germans v/ould have v/withdrawn but for the prosenco of British vessels.Meanwhile the Senior Naval Officer, Baltic was containing the Bolshevik fleet in the Gulf of Finland, and it was recognised in the Baltic Provinces that the safety of Roval and  possibly    of Riga depended on the patrol work of the British forces in the Finnish Gulf and on their daring raids by sea and air against the Bolshevik naval bases.In October 1919, when Bermondt with German and Russian troops all but took Riga, an allied but prodominarit-ly British Naval foroe bombarded the enemy and enabled Lettish forces to cross the Dvina, leading directly to the capture of Mitau and the collapse of the Bermondt adventure. At the end of the month British Ships with the co-operation of Lettish troops on shoro repulsed an attack by Bermondt on Libau.The general effect of the activities of the British Fleet in the Baltic from the Armistice up to the present time has been to make that sea consistently and unquestionable-ably safe for all lawful voyages at a time when the attempt of Allied representatives to pro about their business on shore would have been always difficult and sometimes impossible but for the presence of British ships in the background.The opinion is expressed that both.the Esthonian and Latvian Governments owe their present existence to British sea-power and that without it their territories would long ago have been in Bolshovik or German hands.   .In/
In both countries British prestige, due almost entirely to the Royal Navy, ranks higher than that of any other foreign people.British Naval Control of the Baltic, so unquestionable-ed that it has come to be taken for granted, ha3 been strongly felt hot only in the Baltic Provinces but in Soviet Russia.No one can foresee the ultimate political fate of the South Baltic coast or that of the Russian hinter-land, but the fate of both is of direct importance to Great Britain if only on economic grounds,.   No influence that can in the immediate future be brought to bear on this problem is so certain as that exercised by the presence of British Naval forces in the Baltic, and the suggestion is made that any hasty dispersal of these forces might havo grave re-actions.Too close a naval intervention mi $it naturally lead to embarrassments, but while avoiding these the Royal Navy could at a comparatively snail cost maintain the security of the Baltic and the pro-eminence of British prestige on the Baltic coasts.This could be done by the presence from time to time of a cruising force in the Baltic ports&apos;, together perhaps with the supply of British technical assistance to any of the small Baltic states that required help in organising their sea forces.The despatch closes with a personal tribute to the help consistently afforded to the British Commission by the Senior and other Naval Officers of the Baltic Squadron alike in great matters and small.
