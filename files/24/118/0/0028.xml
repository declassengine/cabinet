as a manufacturing nation has been, to a very large exoent the re cult of cheap Import of raw material which before the war was in many cases brought into this country at not much above cost price.   This was possible because ships received larger outward freights for carrying coal which were paid by the foreigner, and compensated for the low freight homewards.The position tc-day has entirely changed and a large percentage of steamers proceed to the River plate, America,Australia Spain,etc., in ballast, throwing the whole cost of the voyage on the imported price of raw material.For instance the Iron and Steel Industry is one of the largest in the country.   Every ton of pig-iron produced means the importation of about two tpns of iron ore.   The present cost of importing ore from Spain is now round about 2o/- to the Clyde whereas pre-war it did not exceed one-third, of this figure, which means an additional cost on every ton of pig-iron of about 30/- per ton.It might be that when decontrol come3 that there would be a small temporary rise in the price of home coal, though this is extremely doubtful, but it would restore the general trade without which there can be no prosperity.There is an. impression that there would be an immediate bound in coal export to old time figures, if control gees, but this is quite impossible as under present conditions it would be impossible to pass anything like the same amount of coal through the ports, as in pre-war days, and further it will take a long time to bring trade back.In the circumstances the Shipping Controller presses for immediate decontrol of the Industry and also that the president of the Board of Trade be requested to use very effort at once to get Coal Masters, to do away with all combinations and rings, so that Shipping may be treated exactly like other National industries, and a3 has always been the case in the past. \ ------0O0-----------fc^iry of Shipping, m January,1921.
