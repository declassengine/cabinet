Hhe statement is made up of the two following allegations:-(1) that the finance Committee of the Cabinet hascalled a halt in the Housing programme of theGovernment; and(E) that the statistics published recently by the registrar-General reveal a shortage of nearly140,000 houses as against the far larger figureof 500s000 which has been given again and-againby responsible members of the Government,On the assumption that these two allegations are not true in substance, I regard it as imperative that they should be oorrected publicly and at once.   Otherwise the Building Trades Operatives are in a position to repeat (with no little show of truth this time) that the grounds on which we have made our appeal to them are fundamentally inaccurate,(SignedJ I.
