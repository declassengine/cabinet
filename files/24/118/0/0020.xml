Statiatios of Outrages^The number of sorious outrages reported for the week ended the 1st instant reached a total of 73, an increase of 30 on the figures of the previous week.   The increase was almost wholly duo to revived activity in the form of raids on mails, the numbers of which rose from 17 to 35 and raids for arms which rose from 4 to 15.Police casualties for the week v/ere 5  illed snl 6 wounded, as compared with 1 killed and 5 wounded for the previous week. .    The only military casualty was one case of wounding.Two serious,encounters between Crown forces and insurgent bands were reported.     On the 29 th ult-, a police patrol of ten men was attacked about 904Q p.m. in the centre of the town of Midleton, Co, Cork and five of its number fell wounded, one mortally in the first volley.   The remainder were unable to defend themselves successfully against the sustained fire of their assailants and were compelled to surrender their arms.

Although it has not yet boon possible to identify any of the persons who wore actually engaged in these attacks, tho Military Governor is of.opinion that tho preparations could not have boon carried out without the knowledge of many of tho local residents who were thexoforo involved in guilt at least -to the extent of their failure to give information to the military or police authorities *   It was accordingly decided to destroy certain houses in the immediate vicinity of the outrages as a punitive measure tuid a deterrent example to other districts in tho Martial Lsw Area,     This operation wes duly carried oution the 1st instant.     notice -was served on the occupiers of seven houses, giving them one hour to remove their valuables but not their furniture, end the houses were then destroyed by burning,   no foodstuffs corn or hay wore destroyed.Another important incident took place at Ballybjf&quot;&apos;, CarricMacross District, Co,&apos; Monaghan, on the night of the&apos;let instant, when a petrol-of four men were attacked, two be in; wounded.     Another patrol of three men coming to their assistance were also fired upon and lost ono of their number-&apos; killed and one wounded.     It appeared that an attack was contemplated-, on the Ballybay -Police Barracks but this was prevented by the arrival of a military relief party from Bundalfc, which succeeded
with difficulty in j-e aching Bailybay on the- early morning of the 2nd instant..

On  he Great
Southern and Western and the Dublin and South Eastern systems the full normal winter services have now been resumed, and the Great Western Railway re-opened their steam boat service between Fishguard and Rosslare on the 3rd instant. Resumption of the normal service on the Midland Great Western Railway is still delayed owing to the continuance of the Boilermakers strike, no progress towards a settlement of which has yet been made, the members of the grade affected by the dispute having declined to submit their claim to arbitration. The Great Northern Railway Company adhere to their refusal to re-instate their suspended employees except on consideration of individual applications. This matter is receiving the personal attention of the Minister of Transport. The employees of the London and North Western Railway at North Wall recommenced work on the 31st ultimo, and the Company&apos;s cargo boat service between North Wall and Holyhead was resumed on that date.
