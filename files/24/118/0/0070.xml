CABINET.

EX-SERVICE MEN AND HOUSING OPERATIONS.



Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.

1. In a short note which I circulated on the 15th January, I called the attention of the Cabinet to the necessity of taking up at once the question of the redemption of our undertaking to ex-Service men, that somehow or other 50,000 of them should forthwith be put upon Housing operations.

2. Now, so far as I can see, the Building Trade Operatives will refuse to meet us on this matter. They tell us that we shall not get their answer till after February 3rd.

It is therefore our imperative duty to proceed to carry out the undertaking we have given to the ex-Service men.

3. Several alternatives offer :-

(a) There are enough sites now ready for Building operations - other than sites upon which building is already proceeding with Union labour - to take 50,000 ex-Service men. Those sites are in the possession of tho Local Authorities, and building upon them would be operated by the Local Authorities through Contractors. Most of them would be disinclined to start work with ex-Service men for fear of Strikes on all other operations, Housing and otherwise, and amongst their municipal servants. But in my opinion all Local Authorities should be asked if they will take on ex-Service men for Housing operations on the sites in question. The Cabinet will no doubt carefully consider the situation which would arise in connection with the Ministry of Health&apos;s Housing Schemes - which I understand are proceeding with enhanced expedition and volume during the last few weeks - if, as a result of our action taken to implement the promise to the 50,000 ex-Service men, the Building Operatives "down tools" on all Housing operations now in progress. Possibly the line of least resistance would be to develop on available sites, methods of construction other than those now in general use. And indeed it might be possible to vary some existing contracts not yet being operated, by the introduction of methods of construction other than those ordinarily followed. I may say that I have received a number of suggestions, notably one from the Officers&apos; Association, to start work erecting houses with concrete and wood as the main constituents. In my judgment, no difficulty whatever should be put in the way of such proposals, assuming they involve the employment of ex-Service


ex-Service mon and are designed to provide suitable Housing accommodation at reasonable rents.(b) I understand that one Local Authority, the Oity of London-would be prepared to proceed with ex-Service men on the site now in lte possession.    I recommend that the Ministry of Hoalth prepare forthwith to start operations through the   * Contractors in this case with ex-Service men on that site, without any roforonce whatever to Union membership, immediately tho Building Trade Operatives1 answer is received (If, as I assume, it iB unfavourable); and that all neoossary measures to this ond be tax on at onoe with the Corporation and the Contractor.(c) My view is that a number of Local Authorities now hesitation-ting will be compelled by public opinion to offor to proceed   -similarly, onoo work with ex-Sorvioe men on this site gets going.    (But, of course, as I have said before, the effeot of all this upon existing Housing operations must be carefully weighed).(d) There remains, more or less altornative to all this, the policy of Direct Building operations on the sites in the   % possession of the Local Authorities by tho office   of Works. (Of courso, if the Looal Authorities oppose this we could not, as the law stands, take their sites for this purpose; and prompt acquisition of other sites for Housing purposes would presumably need legislation),I am well aware of the hostility to direct employment of labour by the Office of Works.    I am, however, perfectly confident that in the last resort direct operations by the Office of Works would be endorsed in Parliament and out of it as a simple act of Justice towards tho ex-Service men - if it were clear that by this means alone could we redeem our promise to theso men.(o) There is the further possibility of operating through thebuilding Guild Bystem.    And nothing would surprise me less than to find that the Building Trade Operatives put that forward as another subject for further discussion - though I should be surprised to find them advocating it as a means of absorbing ex-Service men.    It might, howevor^ be considered whether, in addition to the foregoing proposal Sj, any Guild that cares to tender should be allowed to do so, conditional upon adequate arrangements being made by tho Guild for the employment of additional ex-Service men.    But, owing to the opposition of Employers to the Guild system in the Building Trades, apparently such action would lessen the prospects of coming to terms with Employers under any of the methods of procedure previously enumerated.I am bound to ask the Cabinet to give very early consideration indeed to the several recommendations and suggestions contained in this papers    Out of the complexity of the whole business, this emerges        That we have got to keep, and keep promptly, our promise that 50,000 ex-Service men shall be put upon Housing operations.(Sgd.)
