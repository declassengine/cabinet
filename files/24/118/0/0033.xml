?HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT),5 E C R E T.C A B I N E T.THE CONTINUANCE OF AN ORGANISATION TO h&apos;KET STRIKES.(Note by the Chairman of tho Supply &amp; Transport Committee).A Conference of Ministers will consider on Monday, January 10th. the Memorandum by the Food Controller on Ancillary Food Services (0*r,22S7)*     In connection with the paragraph of that Memorandum headed &quot;Emergency Organisa-tion&quot;, I -desire to obtain a decision from the Cabinet as to whether an organisation for meeting strikes should be con-tlnued In existence during times of industrial peace-;     As stated by the Food Controller in his Memorandum, the Supply and Transport Committee consider that if the Government decide.to continue an organisation for supplying the necessities of life to the country- it is essential that the nucleus organisation described by the Food Controller should be continued.The question of the desirability of continuing the Supply and Transport organisation is principally one of finance, and the following estimate of annual expenditure by the component parts of the present organisation may be of use to the Cabinet:-Name of Service *Food Service (See C.P.2287)Supply Department.NOTE: Expenditure up to  1,000 perannum has already been sanctioned, This covers travelling expenses of Chairmen of Local Committees and stationery.     There aro no expenses for salaries of head-quarters ! staff or for office accommodation-,Estimated cost per annum if no strike occurs, 85,000 1,000 86,000
 86.000Scottish Office Volunteer Services.200Communications.(1) Aeroplane ServicesMil.(2) V/1 r e 1 e s s P c h etne.&apos;10,000Electrical Services*250Road Transport.600This expenditure is borne finally on the Votes of the Departments cohcernedA viz; Admiralty,, Air Ministry and. War Office,ft)T:,L,  97,060The remaining services (Finance, Coal. Protection, Publicity,. Motor Spirit, Canals and Transport) cost nothing, except during strikes.Air-Marshal Sir Hugh Trenchard, who is in charge of the Communications Section, has recently made a suggestion that the Wireless Schome which is estimated as costing  10-000 per annum should be extended9     He inform is me that the coal strike showed that e xtra stations would bo urgently needed to provide even a skeleton service for the various Government Departments which would require to use a wireless scheme if the ordinary means of communication failed,.     It is felt that a future emergency will in all probability mature more speedily than the last coal strike, and there will not be the same interval for preparations *     Air-Marshal Sir Hugh Trenchard accordingly desires to obtain approval for the retention of 12 additional stations by the War Office, beyond the 12 already authorised for the nucleus schemes     He estimates that the cost of maintaining these additional stations will &quot;be^ for personnel, about  4,000 por annum, and, for running, about  1,000 per annum, making an estimated additional cost of  5,000 per annum, which would be borne on the Votes of the fighting Departments.2With/
With regard to Air Marshal Sir Hugh trenchard:s pro-posals, in my opinion it is essential that if the Govern-ment are to maintain an anti-strike organisation the com-muni cat ions scheme should be a satisfactory one for it Is on the maintenance of communications   that public order and government ultimately rest.     If, therefore, the Cabinet decide that the present Supply and Transport organisation; including the communications scheme, should be continued in existence, I desire that authority should be given for the expenditure of an additional  5.000 per annum in order to nuke the scheme thoroughly satisfactory.(Signed) ERIC GEDDES.Ministry of Transport,7th Januaryn 19.21 s
