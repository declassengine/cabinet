Military Committee of Versailles feels called upon to draw attention to the fact that according to reports received from General IIOLIET and General IvUSTERMAN, the German Government has, since the beginning of December, adopted en attitude of definite resistance to the execution of certain of the essential Military and Air Clauses of the Treaty and the demands of the Allied Governments and the Conference of Ambassadors.The Allied Military Committee of Versailles considers that it is necessary that this attitude which has been clearly demonstrated should be brought to. the.knowledge of the Allied Governments.( 3d,)   FOCH.
AnnoxureALLIED MILITARY COMMITTEE OF VERSAILLES.30 th December, 19SO.REPORT On THE STATE 0? EXECUTION BY GSRMAJJY OF THE MILITARY AUD AERONAUTICAL CLAUSES OB1 THE PEACE TREATY, Of THE SPA PROTOCOL , AND ON THE BOULOGNE NOTE, UP TO DECEMBER 25TH, 19SO.By a note dated December 27th 1920, tho Conference of Ambassadors call pon the Allied Military Committee of Versailles to draw up a general re-ort on the state of execution by Germany of the military and air clauses f the Treaty of Peace and of the Spa Protocol.The meeting of the Supremo Council at Spa (July 5th 1920), preceded j that at Boulogne (June 22nd 1920) had as its object among others, theping in a definite manner of the state of execution by Germany of the hitary and six clauses at that date, that is to say six months after thepose clauses which had either not been executed or been only partially xeouted;   and to fix limiting dates for the execution of such clauses. It is sufficient therefore to review, whilst merely mentioning them,pose clauses whioh were regarded as executed at the time of the Spa bnference.     Those are- Delivery of information regarding the manufacture of explosives Irt, 172).- Suppression of military schools. (Art, 176),!     -   Disarmament of fortifications within a zone 50 km. wide east of he Rhine (Art, ICOh-o these might be added the question of dismantling German fortifications, lie execution of which is proceeding satisfactorily and upon which it is ot necessary to lay stress.On the otlier hand - and in view of their importance - it is necos-ary to examine one by one tho clauses which remained still unexecuted atfitry into force of the Peace Treaty.It was also intended to specifythe tiffi
the time of the Spa Conference. These clauses bear on the following subjecgts :-

- German military legislation and the reduction of the German Army;

- The Surrender and destruction of German war material;

- The Suppression of all organisations created in Germany under pretence of assuring the maintenance of order (Sicherhoitspolizei, Einwohnerwohren etc ...).

Those clauses and the state of their ? as established by the information ? by the ? of the Military and ? of control, are examined below.

MILITARY CLAUSES.

1. GERMAN MILITARY LEGISLATION AND GERMAN MILITARY FORCES.

The Boulogne Note and the Spa Protocol had imposed on Germany the following obligation:-

- at once to make its legilsation conform to the military clauses of the peace Treaty.

- to complete the reduction of the strength of the German army to 100,000 men by January 1st 1921.

a) German Legislation.

As regards the legislation referring to military service and the organisation of the army, the German Government passed on August 20th a law providing for : the abolition of compulsory military service and the organisation of the German army according to the stipulations of the Peace Treaty.

This law contained serious omissions and resulted in many pro?ests from the Military Commission of Control.

To remedy it, the German Government brought forward a fresh draft military law. In its turn this draft law also gave rise to certain observations on the part of the Commission of Control :

In particular ...


In particular:- it is not specified that apart from service in the Reich, military service is abolished as regards the German States;effectives of certain&apos;services (service in Artillery De-pots, service in fortifications, administrative personnel, pay-masters, etc..) are not included in the total effectives of 100,003 men and seem to be intended as additional to that figure-;- an article in the law even contemplates including in tho arnjr a series of nameless military organisations of &quot;complementary troops1, (Brganzung struppcn) as to which no definite explanation is given.Observations on this point were addressed to the German Govcrn-ment-i   To these no answer has as yet been received.   It follows therefore that at the moment,, the German legislation with regard to military laws is not yet established in conformity with the stipulated-lations of the Treaty,b) Reduction of the German Army to 100,000 men.A draft organisation with regard to the. reduction of the German army to 100,000 men has been drawn up by the German Government.The Commission of Control has shown that the executive measures for this reduction had already been taken, b*t the detailed examina-tion of the draft organisation has resulted in the Commission making certain observations to which the German Government has not yet answered.Under this reserve, it seems that the reduction of the German Army can be completed ;by.January 1st 1921.   The checking of this reduction by the Commission of Control will begin from that date.c) Organisations for liquidating the former German Army.fjb **i m i* w tut mm *&quot;n ak *a. **b *aj *** ** **i **      *w ****** *t* *- ^m, man ****** *** w *** m       h,       no ^ m m w* mn r-a *m &apos;** *a*      m **. *A ** * ***To effect the dissolution of the former German Army there had been organised in the several General Staffs and units of the old army, certain liquidation organisations (Abwiko lung saunter and
Abwickelungstollen).   The Interallied Military Commission of Control had long since ashed for the suppression of these organisations and had finally fixed January 1st 1921 as the&apos; time limit for their suppression.The German Government having been called upon to comply has in-deed suppressed the liquidation organisations of units (Abwickclung-stellen) by October 1st, &quot;but as regards the staffs of Army Corps, it has simply substituted for these organisations what they oall &quot;Zweig-stelle51 and *&apos;Reoord Offices&quot; comprising for each Army Corps region several former Officers, &apos;N.C.0&apos;s and certain civilian officials.The total strength of these new organisations is oeriainly less by one third than the total strengths of the former liquidation or-organisations or Army Corps Staffs.   It is none the less true that Germany is thus maintaining organisations forbidden by the Peace Treaty.The Interallied Military Commission of Control has protested against the maintenance of these organisations and is suppressing them.11&apos;    SURRENDER AND INSTRUCTION 07 WAR MATERIAL.The Spa Protocol had repeated the clauses of the Peace Treaty imposing upon Germany the obligation oto &quot;surrender to the Allies with a view to destruction, and to assist in the destruction of, all &quot;arms and military material in exoess of the quantities authorised by the Treaty,&quot;The surrender and destruction of the material are proceedingnormally but are not yet completed.Up to December 11th 1520 there had been surrendered:-Guns ....................    30,^00 of which   28,100 destroyedlinenwerfer.............   10,120 &quot; &quot;        7,600      &quot;Machine Guns.............   65,360 &quot; ..&quot;  -    0,270      &apos;&quot; .Small Arms ............ 2,78.5,220 &quot; &quot; 2,304,820       &quot;It is however necessary to draw special attention&apos;to the objection made by Germany to the surrender of heavy artillerymaterial at Custrin and K^ni^sbcrg (in excess of the armaments&apos;- 4 - authorised
authorised for the latter fortress in spite of the decision of the Conference of Ambassadors refusing to allow any armament for the fortress of Custrin and fixing an authorised armament for Xonigsberg as proposed hy the Interallied Military Commission of Control. Further, there exists:-(a) Excess material derived from the reduction of the German Army from 200,000 to 100,000 men.(b) Material collected in the Reichswehr Depots which the German Government Las asked for authority to keep as training material or for renewals.The Interallied Military Commission of Control rejects the exaggerate    proposals of the German Government and will insiat upon the surrender of the material of these twe different categories^ fTo sum up, although the surrender and destruction of German war material has already attained very considerable figures, it is none * the less true that the disarmament of Germany is still far from complete.111 * DISARMING THE CIVIL POPULATION, glKWOHlTO..-W8HREN klTD SICHBRHEITSPOLIZSI,The Spa Protocol had imposed upon Germany the obligation &quot;to issue a proclamation demanding the immediate surrender of all arms in the hands of the oivil population ... to proceed immediately with the withdrawal of the arms of the Einwehnarwehren and Sicherheit spelizei.11(a) &quot;Disarming...)IMMMNIiN*l*)*lt.*m *        n. w        W.

a) Disarming the civil population.

The legislative measures for assuring the disarming of the civil population were taken in August (the law of August 7th and the Regulations of August 22nd) and the surrender of arms began on September, 15th.

Up to now there has been delivered to the Commission of Control only an insignificant part of the arms reported by the Rei?hs Commissioner for Disarmament as having been surrendered by the civil population to the German authorities.  Therefore from the point of view of the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control execution of this clause has been only begun.

b) Disarming of the Linwohnerwehren and self Protection Organisations.

A certain number of arms have, it is true, been surrendered, particularly in Prussia, but the ?ichs commissioner, whose duty it is to fix the date by which all arms of the  Linwohnerwehren should be delivered, has not yet officially communicated this date to the Commission of Control. Not only this, but the German Government by it? Note of December 9th informed the Commission of Control that the arms of the Linwohnerwehren  in North and Central Germany could not, be withdrawn before March 1st 1921, while it has on two occasions formally refused to carry out the disarmament of the Linwohnerwehren and self Protection Organisations in East Prussia and ?avaria, pretending that the situation does not.......

Up to December 1st the material delivered to the Commission of Control and derived from the Linwohnerwehren and from the disarming of the civil population was -

Guns ... ... ... 41.

Mortars ... ... .. 47.

Machine Guns ... ... ... 3733.

Small Arms ... ... ... 377,03.

On the other hand, the German Government furnished the following information which it has not been possible  for the Commission of control to check -

Arms declared as surrendered to the German authorities by the population up to October 31st 1920 -

Small  arms ...  .... 1,30l, 783.

Machine Guns ...  ... 9,133.

Depots of arms declared by organisations  up till November 30th 1920 -

Small arms ... .... 801,653.

Machine Guns ... ...8,404.

These figures have not been accepted by, the Commission of Control and  are subject to verification.


does not allow of this measure&apos; being taken at present.It oan thus be seen that the disarmament of the J5im*hnerwehren is not only hardly begun in the general area of the Reioh, but tho German Government actually refuses to carry outtthe disarming in Bavaria and East Prussia&apos;.c) Disarming the &quot;oioherheltspolizei.&quot;The disarming of the oicherheitspolizei is in progress and about two thiida of their arms have been surrendered, *To sum up, if the disarming of the oicherheitspolizei is rela-tively well advanced, on the contrary that of the civil population is only b&apos;cgun, while that of the EinwQhnerwehren it not only hardly started, but is even refused, by the German Government in so far as Bavaria and East Prussia are concerned.17*   DXoSQLITTIQfl OF THji, 6lOHFJEHhIToIQLI^BI, The Boulogne Ilote of June 22nd 1920 imposed upon Germany the obligation to dissolve the oicherheitspoIizei within three monthsf that&apos; is to say by September 22nd, 1920 at the latest.Bixtoen btates out of 18 which form the Reich have published decrees ordering the dissolution of their oioherheitspolizoi but up to new the result of the control operations do not allow us to record this dissolution as having been effectively realised any-where.   The President of the Interallied ^ilitarv Commission ofControl ....Up to December 1st, the oicherheitspolizei had surrendered:500 guns 530 mortar8* 1,530 machine guns 54,860 small arms out of about 75,000
Control.formally notified.the German (krvernment of this and has oalled upon the latter to proceed v,ith the dissolution.The German answer dated  eoember 26th merely contains a pro-test without indioatirg any date for the dissolution of this Po3J.ce.V. DISSOLUTION Off THE BUT&quot;OHIJKVVEHEEK AND SELBbTdCHUTZORGANISATTONENThe Boulogne Note of June 22nd 1220 called upen the German Gov-ernment effectively to suppreis the Ein-.vohnc:nv:toen formations. This demand has remained a dead letter up to now. If in North Germany and in saxony these organisations have been officially dissolved, they have been reconstituted under other titles.    In East irussia and Bavaria, not only do the;,  still exist, but, contrary to Art. 177 the^ are connected \ ith the iieichswehr. By two successive Notes the- German &amp;*vernmejcrfc. has informed the Corn-mission of Control that it is unable at present to order this sup-pressmen, and has informed ,the Commission that it (i,e, the German Government) would submit the .uestion to the Conference of Ambassadors-dors.Thus no effective dissolution of the formations of Einwwbnsr-wehren and^elf JLcrtect ion&quot; has been realised, although their main-tenance constitutes - inspite of the denials of the German Govern-*meat - a flagrant violation of articles IV7 and 17G of the Peace Treaty, as also of the Boulogne i;Jote.To sum up, and ignoring the clauses of the Treaty the execution of which are in progress and those which the Commission of Control seems able to have executed at an early,dat?, it should be stated that the German Government claims to maintain the &apos; so called nSelf Protective&quot; organisations and also the armament of a portion of them, while it has taken no effective measures for the dissolution of the sicherheitspolizei.Thus, the German Government is opt 0sing an essential clause of the Peace Treaty to which its attention was imperatively,drawn bythe Boulogne ...
the Boulogne...Hote.jmc^uha^pa Jwixxtol*,To explain sr. oh an attitude cjie^^urLOt-Ti^M^Lxha pro text in-provoked by t?ae Gerr/ca^-(krver.TG.3Juu; the necessity of the maintenance of order0It is sufficient indeed to recall that the iiai.atenan.oe of order is assured in Germany:(a) by the Eeichswe.hr which, by virtue of Art. 13C of the Treaty of Versailles &quot;shall be^ devoted evasively to the maintenance cf order within the territory, and to the control of the frontiers.&quot;(b) by the Police and GeMartuor5e, the authorized strength of which were raised by the Boulogne Uote of June 22nd from 92,000to 150,000 for the Police and from 12,000 to 17,000 for the Gendar-merie, with a vle*w to ensuring very liberally the maintenance order.The German Government no longer makes any allusion to this very inrr.t;rtsxit oonoession and its olaims &quot;would load one to suppose that the concessions are non-existent.,It is necessary moreover to observe, that if, at the time cf their Qreati^n, some of these organisations seemed to answer to the needs of internal security, it cannot be maintained on the other hand that the nu&amp;ber and importance of these organisations should be constantly developed now that order has been re-established in Germany*Nor can one explain why these different organisations, if theyare only intended for local needs, seem to be oo-crdinated for&quot;the&apos;xwhole cf Germany by a central organisation,   or why -$hey should be linked r-ith the Beichswehr as, has been definitely established.On the .....This Central Organisation has at Its head ESCHEF.ICH who is at the same time chief of the; Bavarian EIIIYvOHIJI3iaSHHE.il.
On the othoi hand all these dispositions, by the facilities which they afford to tho preparation of a general mobilisation of the German peoplo, explain xho obstinacy with which the German Government is trying to maintain thorn in opposition to the Treaty.Tho Ger.:,an Government moreover does not deny, in its iioto of Deo ember 2 ndv thet tho measures which it tooK, -and whioh it attempts to maintain, do in fact facilitate such a mobilisation.It confines itsolf to urging that if such is thoir effect. &apos; such was not their object, and that it follows that thoy do not fall under Art. 178 of tho Treaty whioh, according to the Gorman Government, only forbids measures appertaining to mobilisation.In this connection it is sufficient to note that Art, 178 of the Treaty states that :&quot;all measures of mobilisation or appertaining to mobilisation are forbidden&quot; and that in oensequenco any measure which has tho effect of preparing for mobilisation is in opposition alike to the spirit and the letter of tho Treaty&quot;.Consequently,, the Allied Military Committee of Versailles is unanimously of tho opinion that tha German: Government(a) .Jn not takinc any effective measures  &quot;or the dissolution of the Sioherheitspolizei,(b) in refusing to dissolve &quot;Balbstschutzn Organisations and.in trying to justify thoir maintenance,(o) in refusing likewise to proceed with disarming a portion of these organisations.has put itself in o - ouit.ion both to the spirit and the. latter of tho Treaty and to tho explicit decisions taken several times by tho Allied Governments.
The Allied Military Committee of Versailles further reports that :-

- as regards the dissolution of the Sicherhoitspelizei:                                   General Nollet, President of the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control, has on December 23rd by his Note 1266 to the German Government formally recorded "the violation of the stipulations of the Peace Treaty and of the Boulogne Note" involved by the non-execution of this dissolution.

- as regards the dissolution of the Selbetschutz organisations and the disarming of part of these:

The German Government, by its letter of December 9th addressed to General Nollet notified the Allied Governments that it did not consider itself legally bound to the dissolution of the Selbetschutz organisations, also that it could not proceed to disarm these organisations existing in East Prussia and Bavaria: that in addressing this communication to the Allied Governments, the German Government was "fully conscious of the gravity of the resolution it had adopted".

By his letter of December 11th, General Nollet replied to the German Government demanding that he should be informed without delay of the measures taken for the dissolution and the immediate disarming of the Selbetschutz organisation.

To this demand (mise on demsure) the German Government replied on December 22nd referring to its letter of December 9th which it again asked General Nollet to bring to the notice of the Allied Governments.

Thus the German Government has, by its repeated refusals, formally intimated its desire not to conform to Articles 177 and 178 of the Treaty.
