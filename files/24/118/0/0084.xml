CABINETPetroleum In Great Britain. memorandum by the President-of the Board of Trade.General The question of the ownership of petroleum inQuestion.this country domands immediate consideration for two reasons:-(a) Messrs. S. Pearson and Son, acting as agents of the Government, and using State funds, have discovered oil under ground belonging to the Duke of Devonshire.   It has been necessary to sell some of the oil to prevent deterioration, the proceeds being paid   into a suspense account.   The duke&apos;s solicitors have served a writ on Sir John Cadman claiming the proceeds.(b) The Pearson agreement, commits the Governmentto an expendituro of  1,000,000 on boring.   About  500/000 has been spent.   As matters stand, it will be necessary to make provision for the remaining  500,000, or part of it, in next year!s estimates.   If the question of ownership were settled it would no doubt be possible to terminate the agreement on terms which would relievo the exchequer of the outstanding liability and possibly recover some of the money spent.   But until it is settled there can be no basis of negotiation.The recent history of this question is, briefly, as follows:-fca Royalties A Bill introduced in 1917 provided for the acquisition Bill of1917, by the State of the property in petroleum and the payment&apos;.to landowners of a royalty of 9d a ton.   It was withdrawn owing to opposition in the House of Commons. ^otection Arising out of Lord Cowdrayre\ offer to carry outfioids.       experimental drilling in view of the acute shortage
during the War, Sir Geo.Cave on &quot;behalf of the 9 Government, gave to Lord Cowdray an assuranoe thatthe Government would &quot;take steps to protect the oil-fields against indiscriminate drilling not only during the continuance of the Defence of the Realm Kegulations but after the war&quot;,   (i^ee letter dated 20th March 1918 attached to the Pearson Agreement). This was followed by the Petroleum (Production) Act, 1918, and the Pearson Agreement.5.?etroleum This Aet gave effeot to the undertaking referred(Production)Act,1910i      to above by prohibiting the drilling for Petroleum except under licence.   The question of Royalties is not dealt with by the Act, and at the time of its passage, Sir L,Worthington-Evans gave the following undertaking;&quot;Under this Bill the claim (for royalties) is I postponed for settlement till after tho War.   We havenot attempted to deal with it.   I give,the undertaking that we do not and will not indirectly pay royalties under this Bill&quot;.6,The Pearson       Under this Agreement, which was presented toAgree .entParliament, the Minister of Munitions appointed 3,Pearson and Son, Limited to act as agents of the Government for the purpose of conducting drilling -operations in areas most likely to produce oil. The cost of the operations is borne by the Government up to a sum of  1,000,000 and the Agreement provides that any land required for the purpose shall be taken possession of under D.O.R.A.The Agreement is not terminable except by mutual consent until the  1,000,000 has been expended.ins,
U.Results up to date.Rc citiesQuoStiOtteLast Cabinet Pa oi si. on.,Eight bore-holes have so far been carried to a depth at which oil might have been expected; but nnly one has produced oil in commercial quantities. This is the Hards toft well on the Duke of Devonshire&apos;s land;   it has yielded about one ton per day under natural pressure for nearly 20 months.     Five hundred tons have recently been sold at a price of  22-.10-0 a ton, the storage tank having become nearly full.As has been stated above, the Duke of Devonshire!s solicitors demand the proceeds cf the sale of the oil obtained at Kardstoft and have commenced legal action tc enforce their claim.    As the law relating to minerals stands, the claim is probably good.     No doubt, in view of the fact that the Government have borne- the whole expense of producing the oil, the claim would be susceptible of settlement on fair terms. But it is not possible to negotiate for a settlement In view of Sir La Worthington-Evans assurance quoted above, and of the statements made by for. Bonar Law in the House on 22nd October, 1919 and 13th.May, 1920 to the effect that no royalties would be pavable on -petroleum won in this country.In October, 1919, the War Cabinet decided that legislation should be. introduced to provide that:(a) the ownership of all petroleum from horingsin the United Kingdom should be vested In the State and no compensation should be paid, to owners (f)f land in respect of oil itself.(b) compensation should be paid only in respectof disturbances tc property and lcss...of--ameni^yl;o -

PEARSON &amp; SON LIMITED (hereinafter called &quot; the Petroleum Development Managers &quot;) of the other part. WHEREAS the Government is desirous of prospecting for and if and when found working the petroliferous deposits of the United Kingdom. AND WHEREAS the Petroleum Development Managers desire at this time of stress to place their services unreservedly at the disposal of the nation. AND WHEREAS the Petroleum Development Managers have at their own cost and for their own account for the past four years devoted considerable labour and expense to preliminary research in the United Kingdom on this subject and to negotiations for leases of lands in connection therewith. AND WHEREAS such negotiations have not been conducted by them as representing the Government in any way and whilst nothing in this Agreement is to prejudice any rights the Petroleum Development Managers may have as ordinary traders to obtain leases of lands from private owners it is understood between the parties that the Petroleum Development Managers waive any moral or other claim to compensation in connection with such negotiations and leases. AND WHEREAS the Petroleum Development Managers have for their own purposes placed considerable orders in the United States for drilling material suitable for work in the United Kingdom. AND WHEREAS the Petroleum Development Managers have offered for the period of the war to place at the disposal of the Government free of all costs the services of the Petroleum Development Managers and their Geological staff for the purpose of exploration and development subject only to the undertaking from the Government expressed in the correspondence between Sir George Cave and Lord Cowdray on behalf of the Petroleum Development Managers, copies of which and of the letter to the Press referred &apos;to are contained in the Schedule hereto. AND WHEREAS it is of pressing national importance that the prospecting and development work in this connection should be commenced and carried through as promptly as possible. AND WHEREAS the Treasury has for the purpose of such work placed at the disposal of the Minister the sum of  1,000,000. AND WHEREAS it is considered advisable with a view to obtaining the benefits of the knowledge acquired by the Petroleum Development Managers and also in order to secme their experienced services to entrust to them on behalf of the Minister such prospecting and development work as Petroleum Development Managers and to ask them to take subject as is hereinafter provided full control of and to supervise on behalf of the Minister the entire prospecting boring and development in this connection of not more than thirty drilling areas (hereinafter called &quot; the said drilling areas &quot;j of which said drilling areas particulars of 15 areas have been handed in confidence by the Petroleum Develop-ment Managers to the Right Honourable Walter Long, M.P., to be handed by him to the Minister on the passing of the legislation necessary to protect the oil fields against indiscriminate drilling. Particulars of the said 15 areas having already been submitted in confidence for the technical examination and approval of Professor Sir John Cadman, K.C.M.G., of the Petroleum Executive and the Advisory Committee on Petroleum Geology none of such areas shall be objected to on technical grounds but only on grounds of prior contract or other legal obstacle. AND WHEREAS likewise it is considered advisable to entrust the Petroleum Development Managers to undertake on behalf of the Minister the transportation treating and refining of such substance if and when got. AND WHEREAS the War Cabinet considering this matter of great urgency has instructed the Minister to request the Petroleum Development Managers to under-take the said office of Petroleum Development Managers which they are willing to do as Agents for the Government provided that they shall be permitted to carry out the operations in accordance with their usual business methods. NOW IT IS HEREBY AGREED AS FOLLOWS:1. THE Petroleum Development Managers at the request of the Minister agree to act as the Agents of the Government in and about the matters referred to in this Contract and shall make full reports to the Minister in such manner and at such times as the Minister may from time to time determine in relation to all the said matters and shall(b 13701)  Wt. 30180-ap6012 2c0 11/18 H k S
not at any time unnecessarily disclose any information resulting therefrom to any other person without the previous consent in writing of the Minister. And the Minister shall he free at all times to appoint such representative or representatives as shall be mutually agreed upon between the Minister and the Petroleum Development Managers to inspect and report upon the work carried out by the Petroleum Development Managers.2. THE Petroleum Development Managers hereby certify that the said 15 areas are believed by them to be the best of the whole areas in the United Kingdom known to them and the most likely to produce oil on a commercial basis and it is understood be-tween the parties that Mr. Walter Long will take the necessary precautions so that until the said legislation has been passed no particulars of the said drilling areas shall be divulged to any third party but this undertaking shall not apply to necessary particulars in respect of land of which the Minister shall have been requested to take possession under Clause 5 hereof.3. DURING the continuance of this Contract at such times as may he required for the economic development of the business particulars of additional areas in excess of the said 15 areas but not exceeding 30 areas in the aggregate shall be handed in by the Petroleum Development Managers after having been technically examined and approved by Professor Sir John Cadman, K.C.M.G., to the Minister and shall thereupon be deemed to form part of the said drilling areas.It is hereby understood that in the event of any legislation being passed which provides for the granting of licenses to drill for petroleum the Petroleum Development Managers shall be at liberty to apply for any such license or licenses.4. THE Petroleum Development Managers on behalf and subject to the conditions specified in Clause 10 hereof at the cost and expense in all respects of the Minister under-take entire control selection direction and management of the geological examinations prospecting boring and development within the said Drilling Areas and likewise of the transportation treating and refining and all other operations necessary to the finding raising winning transporting storing treating and refining of the petroliferous deposits (including petroleum and natural gas and related hydrocarbons) and also the installations of pipelines reservoirs storage facilities preparation and erection. of a treating plant or plants refinery or refineries for the proper transportation storing and treatment of the above mentioned substances all of which shall be hereinafter included in the expression &quot; the said work &quot; and shall use their best endeavours to prove the existence and commence the production of the said substances or any of them at the earliest possible date and in particular they shall have full discretionary powers to use their own judgment as to when it is desirable to place orders with Contractors whether in the United Kingdom or with the previous consent in writing of the Minister elsewhere for the necessary machinery and materials in. connection therewith taking into consideration the probability that it will be necessary to place such orders before the existence in commercial quantities of petroleum or any of the above substances has been definitely proved so that the nation may have the benefit of suchproductionand/orproductstherefromforthepurposesof the War at theearliest possible moment after same has been established and in particular the Petroleum Develop-ment Managers shall place at the disposal of the Minister at the total cost thereof with 5 per cent, interest thereon from the date of the respective payments therefor the said chilling materials now the property of the Petroleum Development Managers and lying in storage in the United States or elsewhere or ordered by and on account of the Petroleum Development Managers and intended and suitable for work under this Contract in the United Kingdom.5. THE Minister shall cause any land which the Petroleum Development Managers shall with the approval of the Minister reasonably require for the operation of sinking wells or constructing works comprised within the operations of this Contract to be taken possession of under the Defence of the Realm Regulations or otherwise as the Minister may determine and a duly qualified officer of the Directorate of Lanc(s to be agreed upon by the Minister and the Petroleum Development Managers shall be attached to the Petroleum Development Managers for the purpose and the Minister shall have power from time to time to appoint a. successor to or substitute for such officer subject to agreement as aforesaid as to such successor or substitute.6. IN the carrying out of the said work the Petroleum Development Managers shall be entrusted as sole Agents with the preparation of all the necessary plans and designs and
(subject to the directions as regards foreign purchases from time to time to be given by the Minister) with the placing of all Contracts in connection with the purchase of the necessary supplies materials plant and machinery and the Petroleum Development Managers shall have full control and discretionary powers as to all matters connected with the carrying out of the provisions of this Contract and in particular as to the making carrying out varying cancelling and dealing on behalf of the Minister with all Contracts in connection with the installation of the said work and plant and (subject as aforesaid) the purchase of the supplies material plant and machinery and so that any such contracts may provide wherever necessary for reasonable advances or bonuses being made to the contractors thereunder ; and in view of the fact that it has been found necessary to limit and direct the production of many classes of material which will be required in connection with the said operations the Minister agrees without in any way limiting the powers of the Petroleum Development Managers if and when so requested by the Petroleum Development Managers to do so to give all facilities and authorities for the placing of the necessary contracts for material when and where the Petroleum Development Managers consider most advantageous further that he will give to the Petroleum Development Managers facilities whereby their requirements in this connection shall have such priority as is demanded by the urgent nature of the work and can properly be granted.7. THE Minister recognising the national importance of the work provided for in this contract agrees that it shall be treated as Certified War Work (Class A) as defined in the First Schedule of the Order as to Priority dated the 8th Day of March. 1917 or within the corresponding class according as the said order may from time to time be varied or replaced.8. IF it shall be evident to the Petroleum Development Managers that any borehole in any of the said drilling areas will probably pass through seams or beds of coal or any other mineral either abandoned or in working the Petroleum Development Managers shall thereupon give notice in writing to the owner or worker (if any) of such mineral beds or seams and to the Minister of their intention to drill through these beds or seams and at the same time request the owner or worker of these beds or seams as the case may be to furnish copies of such underground, maps as exist of the mine or workings in order that if possible due provision may be made by the Petroleum Development Managers and at the Minister&apos;s expense for the passing of the borehole and casing through the said beds or seams so as to cause a minimum of damage and inconvenience to the owner or worker of the said beds and seams.9. THE Petroleum Development Managers shall have full discretion as to the appointing and dismissing the staff necessary for supervision and ensuring the due carrying out of the said work and fixing their remuneration byway of salary and/or bonus. The salaries except as provided for in Clause 10 hereof of the members of their staff and of such other employees as they may find it necessary from time to time to engage in prosecut-ing this work will be charged to the Minister.10. THE Petroleum Development Managers agree that the whole of the work under-taken by them in connection with this contract shall be done by them without any fee or remuneration whatsoever for their services or the services of their directors and that they will also provide free of charge in respect of their salaries such services of their present geological staff as may be required and further that they will make no charge for salaries for services rendered by any of their present Westminster Office Staff where such services do not call for more than 50 per cent, in any one month of their time given to this work by such employees it being left entirely to the Petroleum Development Managers&apos; discretion to what extent then services are a fair charge against the work in question. The Petroleum Development Managers will further provide- free of all charge to the Minister the necessary London Office accommodation in their Offices at 10 Victoria Street, Westminster S.W.11. THE Minister will give favourable consideration to any request to that effect by the Petroleum Development Managers and will use his best endeavours with the Admiralty or the War Office or other Government Departments to obtain the recall of any persons at present serving with H.M.

Graham Greene on behalf of the Minister and of Sir Edward Ernest Pearson on behalf of S. Pearson &amp; Son, Limited.(Signed)     W. GRAHAM GREENE.(Signed)     E. E. PEARSON,Director.(Signed)     C. J. NEWMAN,Asst. Secretary.The SCHEDULE above referred to :-47, Parliament Street,S.W.1. 1st March, 1918..To the Editor of Sir,PETROLEUM IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.In the course of the Debate in the House of Commons on Wednesday last my Firm was mentioned in connection with the development of petroleum in the United Kingdom. I venture, therefore, to draw the attention of your readers to the position which exists, and to certain views I hold thereon.(2) Extensive studies carried out by my scientific staff during the last three and a-half years lead me to the conclusion that, notwithstanding the long-established opinion to the contrary, the possibilities of securing a commercial production of oil in Great Britain are of a distinctly promising nature, and we have, from time-to time, advised the Admiralty to this effect.(3) Experience in America has shown that the policy, of uncontrolled working, and that on small areas, is a national blunder. Moreover, this method of working has produced wild speculation and has resulted in the most deplorable waste. According to American scientific estimates there is only oil in sight in that great Continent for another twenty-nine years. This situation is causing serious disquietude to the Govern-nient of the United States.(4) This is the position which the United Kingdom will have to face if unorganised drilling be permitted.(5) In June last  was approached by the Admiralty with a view to immediate drilling as a war measure. At that time my Firm were negotiating with certain landlords with a view to arranging leases. It must be remembered that, dependent on the nature of the strata, a well will drain oil for a distance varying from a few yards to a few miles.
As wo were not in control of anything approaching the areas requisite to obviate the evils of the small block system, my reply to the Admiralty was that I recommended a system of National drilling licences as the only sound policy for the Nation.(6) From the production point of view, I am not concerned whether royalty shall or shall not be paid to landlords, but I am concerned with the preservation of what should become a great National industry. So little is known by the public about oil that its interest in the question is but lukewarm. No one can say for certain whether the United Kingdom will produce oil or not. This only the drill can prove. My American expert advisers (whose opinion I.value) tell me that they think that oil will be found in commercial quantities.(7) Recognising as I do that the potential wealth of the United Kingdom in oil is as essential for our Mercantile Marine of the future as coal has been in the past, I beg the public to realise the importance of the issue I am raising. My ambition is to see this industry born and reared so that the Nation may benefit to the full, not only from a new source of great possible wealth, but from tho conservation of a factor vital to its maintenance as a great Ocean Power.(8) With this object we. have made alternative offers to the Government, subject to the passing of the necessary Act to safeguard the industry, offers which are still open : (a) For the period of the war to place at tho disposal of the Government, free of alhcost, the services of my Firm and geologic staff, for the purposes of exploration and development.(b) If the Government does not wish to risk public money on what must be deemed a speculative enter-prise, we are prepared to drill, at our own risk and expense as licencees, subject to certain areas being reserved to us.This offer committed my Firm to a probable expenditure of  500,000.(9) Operating as the Government now suggests, without legislation and under the Defence of the Realm Act, the position of the Government is that of a temporarily legalised trespasser and after the war the benefit of National expenditure will revert to the owner of the land. The country will have run the risk, others will be entitled to the post-war gains. Even if the Acquisition of Lands Act applies, and I am advised it does not, it means that the Nation must acquire in each case the land necessary to protect the whole oil pool, which may even amount to thousands of acres, not at normal values, but at a price having regard to its being a proved oil territory.(10) More serious, however, than the financial losses which working under the Defence of the Realm Act will entail is the result that, presuming drilling be successful and oil proved vested interests will have been created throughout the country and as a consequence the legislation essential to the welfare of the industry will then meet with opposition many times stronger than that with which it is confronted to-day.(11) My earnest hope is that Parliament, being apprised of the situation, will not allow this nascent industry to be sacrificed on the altar of indecision merely because those interested for and against a royalty arc not willing to come to a compromise.I am,Yours faithfully,(Signed) COWDRAY.Dear Lord Cowdray,Referring to the conversation which you and Sir Clarendon Hyde had yesterday with Mr. Bonar Law and myself, I understand that you are prepared to proceed at once with the offer marked (a) in your letter to the press provided that the Government will appoint a Committee to consider and advise as to the best manner of protecting the &quot; oil pools &quot; in areas where drilling is commenced.Mr. Bonar Law authorises me to say that the Government will at once appoint such a Committee ; and he hopes that on this assurance you will, forthwith enter into negotiations with the Board of Trade with a view to the necessary arrangements being made for giving effect to your offer.I am sending a copy of this letter to the Board of Trade.Yours sincerely,(Signed) GEO. GAVE.The Viscount Cowdray.Uth March, 1918.Dear Sir George,Thanks for your letter of the 12th which does not go quite far enough. Our understanding at the interview was that you were to call together your previous Committee to devise some way to protect oil&quot; pools &quot; generally against indiscriminate drilling.  As you know my sole object is to safeguard an industry so vital to the nation.If however, the Government, without awaiting the advice of the proposed Committee, will undertake that this protection shall be afforded, not only for the duration of the Defence of the Realm Regulations but post-war, I am satisfied and will forthwith enter into negotiations with a view to giving effect to the offer marked (a) in my ietter to the Press. As I mentioned, we shall require a practically free hand in the matter with only an agreed limit of expenditure. *Home Office,Whitehall, S.W.1,I2lh March, 1918.
sWe shall be powerless to do efficient work without material, and consequently would it not be more satis-factory for the contract to be with the Ministry of Munitions than with the Board of Trade, the more so as we understand that the Ministry of Munitions has been deputed to carry out oil exploration and production ?Your sincerely,The Right Hon.Sir George Cave, K.C., M.P., Home Office, S.W.1.(Signed)  COWDRAY.Home Office, Whitehall, S.W.1.Uth March, 1918.Dear Loud Cowdray,In answer to your letter of yesterday, I am calling together my previous Committee for Monday next; and I have no doubt that I shall then be in a position to write you a letter which will be satisfactory to you.In the meanwhile I hope that no time will be lost; and as you think it more convenient that you should deal with the Ministry of Munitions for the present there can be no objection to this course.Yours sincerely,The Viscount Cowdray. (Signed) GEO. CAVE.Home Office, Whitehall, S.W.1.20th March, 1918.Dear Lord Cowdray,My Committee have had a preliminary discussion on the subject of your letters ; and I am now authorised to give you on behalf of tho Government the assurance asked for in your letter of the 14th instant, namely, that they will take steps to protect the oil-fields against indiscriminate drilling not only during the continuance of the Defence of the Realm Regulations, but after the war. The precise form in which this protection shall be afforded will receive early and careful consideration.I hope there is now nothing to prevent you from proceeding as rapidly as possible with your negotiations.Yours sincerely,(Signed)  GEO. CAVE.The Viscount Cowdray, 47, Parliament Street, S.W.1.21st March, 1918. L.C.O. 6/39.Dear Sir George,Thanks for your letters of the 12th and of yesterday, which together give us the desired undertaking. We hope in due course to be advised of the precise form in which the industry will be safeguarded.We at once placed ourselves in communication with the Ministry of Munitions. Sir Arthur Churchman, the Controller of Petroleum Production, is away until next week, but his assistant is being seen to-day.I expect some days will be occupied in settling the contract and more particularly so as more than one Department will be concerned in its terms. Meanwhile we consider it would be highly advisable for the Government to instruct us to proceed with the engaging of the personnel and the purchase of such additional plant and well small casing as were not ordered with the ten rigs in the hope that we could secure them iu England, but which we now fear will have to be purchased in the United States.In anticipation of our being desired to place at the disposal of the Government, free of all cost, the services of my Firm and geological staff for the purposes of exploration and development, we have already been moving in several directions and would like to forthwith definitely cable to the United States for the drillers to be engaged as rapidly as good men can be picked up. We ought to move in this matter without a moment&apos;s delay as oil-men are in very great demand in the States at the present time and several weeks may be occupied in securing what we want.* Yours sincerely,(Signed) COWDRAY,Home Office, Whitehall, S.W.1.22nd March, 1918.My Lord,I am desired by Sir George Cave to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of yesterday and to say that he has forwarded it to Mr. Winston Churchill, who is now dealing with the matter.Yours faithfully,The Viscount Cowdray.
