A considerable number of workpeople are still on extended^Christmas andNew Year holidays.

It is reported from Leicester that there is a possibility of a revival in the boot and shoe industry next month, but it will be a considerable time before conditions in this industry approach the normal. As a result of the fixing of definite prices, improvement is expected in the lace trade, and there are also hopes of an early improvement in the hosiery industry. In South
