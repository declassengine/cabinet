OGflHttKT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAHwIC RAJKSIY^S OOVERIMEHT).  0dn hi t,KWimww 0    A    P    I    ^ T( C a4jitREPORT BY THE GENERAL OFFICER C0H; -A^BXllG-IN-CHIEF 03 THE SITUATION El IRELAND FOR THE V;&apos;EEK ENDINGJanuary 15th, 1931.(Circulated to the Cabinet by the Secretary of fit a to for &apos; ar),&apos;1. GhKERAL SITUATION.The Military Situation has developed oa rntzcipated last week aild considerably greater activity has been displayed by the rebels. This seems likely to be continued.     Cork County and City still remain the most disturbed area but hostile activity has been spread over a Urge number of counties throughout Ireland and has considerably increased in Dublin.     Increased activity especially within Martial Law Area can I think be accounted for by the desire of the rebels to shew their contorr.pt for the imposition of Martial Law and to endeavour to hearten up their sympathisers *Attacks have been chiefly directed against tho police forces and several raids have been hade on police barracks all of which wer*3 unsuccessful.     ftotor lorries and cars have also been subject to attacks by bombs and revolver fire and a special troop train was derailed and ambushed in County Donegal.In spite of their activities the rebels have achieved nothing beyond the murder or pounding of some policemen either individually or in patrols and all their attacks on barracks or on organised parties have been unsuccessful^This is in part due to the half-hearted manner in which some of their operations have been carried out, but also in a considerable degree to the satisfactory means of co-operation which now exists amongst the forces cf the Cropm. and to the restrictions on civil Motor traffic which ere now beginning to be felttSearches by troops and police in County ;:.ork have resulted in the capture of three Important dumps of arms, ammunition, and equipment, but so far even in the Partial Law Area, no arms, etc., lave been voluntarily surrendered,     There is reason to believe that to a certain extent arms are bein&amp; thrown into rivers and otherwise disposed of.It is a satisfactory feature that information is being incjjeas-Ingly given by well-disposed persons who see a hope of escape from the Sinn Fein terror!zation.The&apos;&apos;above facts undoubtedly tend, to show that the Military situation is improving and that a firmer grip is being obtained on the rebel activities, and it need hardly be pointed out that the more overt the operations to which the Irish Republican Army commits itself the more easy will it be to deal with it from the Military point of view..On the other hand the Sinn Fein leaders have shewn no desire for any compromise, nor 3 3 there any sign that public opinion is, or for some time is likely to bo, sufficiently strong to compel or even induce them to make any change in their appeal to force. Bo long as they are ab?e to hold large stocks of arms and ammunition wid to carry out ambushes and other crimes with the cognisance (in some cases almost undoubted) of many people,- who, purport to be opposed to methods of violence it cannot be said that any definite point lias been reached towards the settlement of tha country.Until the improvement, which has certainly taken palce in
B 9 &amp;the MUitary Situation is reflected by a general ar.d openly expressed desire,on the part of the population generally,for a reasonable settlemant acceptable to His Majestyfs Government I can see no possible alternative to prosecuting the present activities of the army to the utmost, and enlarging the area subject to Martial Law in which alone the conditions give those activities their full prospects of success^My rersonal opinion based on interviews with many persons on watching the daily occurrences throughout Ireland, and on extensive reading of the past history of the Irish, is that the younger generation are imbued by a spirit of fanatical patriotism, and that the so-called moderates and loyalists have not the aoral or physical courage to stand up for their opinions against the forceful energy of those whose platform is &quot;Ireland a Nation&quot;*   I am also firmly of opinion that any attempt to hold an Election will result either in a complete boycott, or a sweeping victory for Sinn Fein-2, POLITICAL SITUATION OB1 THE ULSTER SIX COUNTY AREA OF NORTHERN IRELAND.    _^_The prospect of the opening of a parliament for the government of the six counties forming Northern Ireland may Involve certain questions with regard to the control of the Military forces which may be stationed therein.
