PART I-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.There is no important change to record in the industrial situation, which remains quiet. The Minister has now appointed a Court of Inquiry under the Industrial Courts Act, 1919, to inquire into the causes and circumstances of the dispute in the tramways industry arising out of the workers&apos; claim for an increase in wages ; and a preliminary meet-ing of the Court was held on the 11th January, when certain points of procedure were settled. The first meeting of the Court has been arranged for the 26th January, and the inquiry will be held in public.The Industrial Court issued their Award, No. 594, on the 11th January, on the claim of the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks, on behalf of their members employed by the Army and Navy Co-operative Society, Ltd., for an increase of wages and certain changes in working conditions. This Award is of importance as the members of the union employed in other London establishments decided on the 11th December last to postpone strike action pending the issue of the Award. It is by no means certain, however, that the finding of the Court will be generally accepted by London employers, as the Incorporated Association of Retail Distributors issued a circular on the 13th December stating that they could not agree to accept in advance an award to which they were not parties; but a meeting of the Joint Shop Committees on the 11th January decided to take all possible steps with a view to securing a general acceptance of the Award.The unemployment situation shows no signs of improvement; on the contrary, the number of unemployed persons steadily increases. The week under review has seen a general hardening on the part of Labour against the Government^ proposals. The workers&apos; representatives on the Joint Industrial Councils connected with Government industrial establishments demanded, at a meeting held on the 10th January, that short-time working should not be accompanied by any reduction in wages, and strong protests have been made by the workers employed at the Royal Dockyards against the Government&apos;s short-time proposals. Of more significance is the attitude of the executive of the Labour Party and the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, who met in London on the 11th January, and decided to refuse to co-operate in the Governments proposed inquiry into unemployment, and strongly condemned the Governments short-time proposals. The meeting also decided to draw up a definite programme and policy with regard to unemployment, and, after securing its approval by a national joint con-ference representative of both bodies, to bring all possible pressure on the Government to secure its acceptance. Attention has already been called in this report to the tendency of the unemployed, especially in London, to organise Distress Committees and manage their own relief funds. Further particulars of this organisation and of its connection with the communist movement are given below. It will be observed that the attempt is now being made to organise the unemployed on a national basis, and to co-operate with the organised Labour movement with a view to compelling the Government, by means of a general strike if necessary, to adopt the policy of the provision of work or full maintenance for the unemployed, as well as the early re-establishment of trade with Russia and recognition of the Soviet Government. Two other significant developments of the situation are also worthy of mention, namely, the increasing difficulty experienced by trade unions, especially in the cotton industry, in meeting their members&apos; claims for unemployment benefit, and the increase in the number of reported cases of attempts, sometimes successful, by employers to persuade their workpeople to accept reduced rates of wages.The Unemployment Position.The number of H.M. Forces and merchant seamen out-of-work donation policies lodged in. Great Britain on the 31st December was 244,670, comprising 244,262
4315.1.21.General Situation-continued.for men and 408 for women. In addition, there were 11,219 policies lodged by short-time workers, 11,199 for men and 20 for women. On the 24th December there were 227,807 policies lodged, 227,368 by men and 439 by women. On the same date there were 7,044 policies lodged by short-time workers, 7,027 for men and 17 for women.On the 31st December, in Great Britain, 402,103 unemployment books, 223,596 for males and 178,507 for females, remained lodged under the Unemployment Insurance Act. Compared with the previous week, when there were 183,008 lodged by males and 141,409 by females, the increase is 77,686. In addition, there were 410,172 policies lodged by short-time workers, 170,703 by males and 239,469 by females, an increase on the previous week of 148,135.The above are advance figures provided by the Employment Department, and are subject to revision.The total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 31st December was 756,823. A full analysis of the unemployment position will be found on p. 57.FEATURES OF THE WEEK.General Topics.Coal Miners. A situation which is attracting considerable public attention has arisen as a result of the recent rapid falling off in the demand for export coal, combined with the reduced inland consumption consequent on the slackness of trade. Among reasons cited for the slump in export prices are the recent Order of the French Minister of Public Works limiting coal import prices for that country, the increased Belgian, French, and German production, and the fact that France and Italy are said to have placed large coal contracts with America as a precautionary measure at the time of the British coal strike. As will be remembered, the financial security of the recent coal strike settlement depended largely upon the high prices then obtainable in the export market, and a temporary wage scale was laid down whereby wages were to be based on the value of the output at the September export prices. Since this settlement, there has been a considerable increase in coal output, and the miners&apos; wages have been raised accordingly. Owing, however, to the fall in export prices, it is said that there is not sufficient profit to meet these increases, and the view has been expressed that the quarter ending the 31st March will show a financial loss. On the 6th January Sir Robert Home, accompanied by Mr. W. C. Bridgeman, held a conference with the executive of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain to discuss this situation and its bearing on wages and the price of inland coal. No official report of this meeting has been issued, but it is understood that the Governments export restriction policy was keenly criticised by the miners. Another aspect of the falling demand for coal has been the tendency to congestion of coal transport facilities, owing to the inability of shippers and home consumers to absorb the output of the miners. As a result several collieries in South Wales have been put on short time, and it is estimated in some quarters that about 20,000 men are now out of work in the Western valleys of Monmouthshire and in the anthracite district.Short Time on Railways. Owing, it is alleged, mainly to the general slackening of trade, a number of temporary railwaymen have recently received notice of the companies&apos; intention to reduce staffs; and further dismissals are anticipated. Those affected, so far, are chiefly men in the goods, porterage and clerical departments. Under the &quot; guaranteed week &quot; of the agreement of March, 1919, the companies are bound to pay full wages to all their employees who present themselves for work, and their only alternative under this agreement is to dismiss those men who are surplus to requirements.Mr. Cramp, industrial secretary of the National Union of Railwaymen, interviewed the Railway Executive on the subject on the 11th January ; he stated that the discharges were becoming far more serious than had been anticipated, especially in Lancashire and in London, and that the whole situation would have to receive careful consideration. A meeting of the executive of the National Union of Railwaymen is being held, therefore, on the 12th January, for this purpose, and the desirability of coming to some agreement with the companies as to the adoption of a system of short time in order to obviate discharges will be considered.(b 16853T) F 2
Cotton Reconstruction Board. Reference was made in last week&apos;s Report to the fact that this Board, formerly the Cotton Control Board, were considering the question of devoting a portion of their funds to relieving cases of distress arising out of the present unemployment in the cotton industry. It is now announced that the Board of Trade sanctioned on the 7th January a scheme submitted by the Reconstruction Board. Under this scheme operatives who were employed at cotton-spinning mills or weaving sheds, in districts which came under the jurisdiction of the Cotton Control Board, on the 30th June, 1920, or who have since been so employed, but who have now become totally unemployed and have not found other employment, may be paid benefits on the following scale : Men, 7s. 6d. per week or Is. 3d per day ; women, 6s. per week or Is. per day ; boys under 18, 3s. 9d. per week or l\d. per day ; girls under 18, 3s. per week or Gd. per day. In addition, operatives who are parents of children under 14 years of age, who are not earning wages, are entitled to receive an additional sum at the rate of Is. Qd. per week or 3d. per day in respect of each child, but husband and wife must not both draw benefit in respect of the same children. Operatives working short time, whether working for a portion of each week, or employed in alternate weeks only, are excluded from benefit, as are also operatives in receipt of sickness benefit under the National Health Insurance Acts, or of compensation under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act.Benefits are to date from the 10th January, 1921, and payment may be made through the agency of the trade unions concerned, or, in districts where no such unions exist, through individual employers.Building Guilds. Further developments in connection with the building guilds are reported as likely to occur. A scheme has been suggested whereby there should be a system of inter-control between the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives, and a national organisation pf the guilds which it is expected will be known as the National Guild of Builders. At present two organisations are in existence the North-Western Guild, with headquarters at Manchester, and the London Guild of Builders, Ltd., with headquarters in London. These were inaugurated by the local branches of the building trade unions; and it is now proposed that the National Federation shall set up a National Guild. It has been stated by Mr. Malcolm Sparkes, of the London Guild of Builders, Ltd., that the draft scheme is ready, all that is wanted being formal ratification by the Federation ; and it is expected that this will be obtained within the next few weeks. The Emergency Committee of the Federation met in London on the 11th January and, after discussing the matter, decided to meet representatives of the guilds as soon as possible. It is claimed that when the organisation is thus cen-tralised, the Guild, if t hey are given the contracts, will be able to meet the whole of the present demand for houses, and to carry out this work at a rate from 15 to 25 per cent, cheaper than the lump sums quoted by private contractors. It should, of course, be understood that the difference between the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives and the guilds is only functional, the same body of workers being organised in the Federation for one purpose and in the guilds for another.Unemployment.Relief of Unemployment. The proposal of the Government for the adoption of a system of short-time working in Government industrial establishments was considered, on the 10th January, at a meeting in Montagu House of the Joint Industrial Councils and the Trade Joint Councils connected with these establishments. The workers&apos; representatives put forward a demand that short-time working should not be accompanied by any reduction in earnings, while the official representatives proposed a reduction of working time, with a corresponding reduction in wages, so as to secure that available employment should be shared as equally as possible.  No conclusion was reached at the conference.Protests against the short-time scheme are reported from the Portsmouth, Pembroke Dock and Devonport yards, and also from Woolwich Arsenal, where the unions are putting forward an alternative scheme suggesting that the men shall have every Saturday off, instead of one week off in six.The London members of the executive of the Labour Party and of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress considered the scheme at a joint meeting on the 6th January, and, in particular, discussed a request of the Minister of Labour that organised labour should co-operate in the proposed inquiry into the relief of unemploy-ment. The proceedings at this meeting were private, but it is understood that much consideration was given to the proposed terms of reference of this committee, and that
it was decided, in view of their limitation to measures of alleviation only, excluding any investigation into the causes of unemployment, to refuse to nominate members, and to send the Minister a full statement of the grounds on which this decision was taken.A further meeting of the full executive of the Labour Party and the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress was held on the 11th January when further 1 proposals of the Government were considered. After full consideration, the invitation to co-operate in the Government inquiry was finally rejected. A resolution with regard to the short-time proposal declared that it was made without any consideration of the diminution of home demands for commodities which would follow, or of the lowering of the general standard of life, involving suffering among the whole wage-earning class; and characterised it as impracticable as a universal policy, and unsatisfactory even as a partial measure to meet the present emergency. A small committee, with Ml-. Arthur Greenwood as secretary, was appointed to draft&quot; a definite programme and policy &quot; with regard to unemployment which, if approved by the&apos; executives, will ultimately be presented for endorsement to a national joint conference, representative of both bodies, and will then be pressed on the Govern-ment. The members of this Committee are Mr. Poulton, Mr. Purcell and Miss Bondfield, representing the Parliamentary Committee, and Mr. Sidney Webb, Mr. Robert Williams and Miss Susan Lawrence, representing the Labour Party. The meeting received a deputation from the workers&apos; side of the Joint Industrial Councils for Government estab-lishments, who reported their rejection of the shorb-time scheme ab the conference of the 10th at the Ministry of Labour. They also received a deputation from the London District Council of Unemployed Organisations, who pressed their demand for full mainten-ance at trade union rates, and for a &quot; down tools &quot; policy if the Government refused to agree to this proposal.The National Alliance of Employers and Employed have also issued a statement on the proposed Committee of Inquiry. They contend that the scope of the committee should not be limited, while its composition should be such that it is fully representative both of employers and workpeople.Interesting schemes for dealing with unemployment are being put into operation by several large firms. Messrs. Rowntree &amp; Co., Ltd., have organised a system of unem-ployment and short-time insurance in connection with their superannuation scheme. Messrs. J. Bibby &amp; Sons, Ltd., Liverpool, have arranged that their employees shall have a three days&apos; holiday every 15 weeks ; Gd. out of every 20s. of wages will be retained by the firm, and repaid to the men when the three days&apos; compulsory idleness occurs. The scheme of the Cotton Reconstruction Board for relieving distress arising out of unemployment in the cotton industry is described above.With regard to the relief of immediate distress, a scheme has been inaugurated by a committee appointed at a meeting of London Mayors on the 6th January. This com-mittee has drafted an appeal asking colliery owners and other krge employing interests for coal, boots, food, &amp;c, for distribution among the London unemployed.Organisations of the Unemployed. The extent to which the unemployed have organised their own relief, particularly in the London area, is of some interest; the facts, so far as can be ascertained, are as follows. There is now a body known as the London District Council of Unemployed Organisations, with headquarters at 28, East Road, City Road, E.C., which undertakes to watch over the interests of the unemployed, to investigate cases of hardship and organise relief. The Council was formed some weeks ago at a meeting to which two delegates were sent from each borough, when Mr. W. Hannington was appointed organiser. The occupying of public buildings in various boroughs of London is stated to have been in accordance with the general plans of the Council, and local committees have been formed in about 22 boroughs to co-ordinate the efforts of the local unemployed, and provide them with a kind of local headquarters staff.A circular has recently been issued by the Council to Trades Councils and local Labour Parties, proposing the organisation of the unemployed on a national basis, with the object of co-operating with the organised Labour movement, to bring the greatest possible pressure to bear on the Government. In this circular, the aims of the Council are stated to be to obtain full maintenance for the unemployed at trade union rates of wages ; and to bring about the re-establishment of trade with Russia and the recognition of the Soviet Government.. It goes on to suggest that the Council of Action should call a national convention to demand the concession of these two objects under the threat of an immediate &quot; down tools &quot; policy. The meeting of the Council of Action, which was held on the 23rd December, was summoned at the instigation of the London District Council of Unemployed Organisations, who sent a deputation to put their views before the members.
It was finally agreed to request the Labour Party to devote part of the time at the special conference on Ireland, on the 29th December, to a discussion of the unemployment question. The London District Council have expressed themselves as very dissatisfied with the part that the Labour Party and Trades Union Congress are playing ; and there is some evidence that the unofficial organisation is. in danger of being used for political ends, abandoning its primary function as a co-ordinating body.. At the same time, there is proof that much actual relief work is being efficiently carried out by the local committees, and that they really represent the unemployed in their districts. The Council are now appeal-ing for funds on behalf of unemployed men arrested at the Islington demonstration, to meet the cost of local committees, and to maintain the dependants of any men who were sent to prison.Another interesting development is the Coventry Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee, whose nucleus was the old shop stewards&apos; and workers&apos; committee, and the local branch of the National Union of Ex-Service Men. This committee differs from the London body in refusing to take any part in relief work, or to accept funds unless for purposes of propa-ganda. It has been in existence for about four months, and was elected at a mass meeting of some 1,200 unemployed workers, with Mr. H. M. Emery as secretary. Each member is a delegate, subject to immediate recall, three members representing the unemployed ex-Service element. A full meeting of the committee is held once a week, and there are standing sub-committees to deal with propaganda, negotiations with the local authorities, and other matters. Meetings are organised at the gates of each works in and about Coventry, and at these the doctrine that the workers should control industry is strenuously preached. Mr. Emery, who is a member of the Communist Party, has recently contributed an article on the work of the committee to the Workers&apos; Dreadnought. He asserts that the Coventry committee&apos;s tactics are &quot; more revolutionary, more dangerous to Capitalism, than those of Committees who go about bragging that they are armed, and urging their fellow workers to seize a library.&quot;Effect on Trade Unions. The effect of the situation on trade union funds is becoming serious in some areas, particularly in the cotton industry. In addition to the cases quoted last week, the Preston Card and Blowing Room and Ring Spinners&apos; Association have been compelled to suspend benefits to members, but will allow them to keep in touch with the association by the payment of Id. per week, until the mills resume full time, and the operatives are again able to pay full contributions. The Ashton-under-Lyne and District Power Loom Weavers&apos; Association have decided to suspend benefits to members working only one loom, and to suspend for a further six. months payment to those members who exhausted their right to benefit six months ago, but who now would ordinarily have become entitled to benefit again. Other organisations also are finding it necessary to take action in view of the drain on their reserve funds.Control of Industry.Railways. A joint committee representing the National Union of Railwaymen, the Railway Clerks&apos; Association, and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, has been set up to watch developments in connection with the Ministry of Trans-port^ proposals for the future organisation of the railways. The members met at Unity House on the 6th January and discussed the proposals as set forth in Command Paper No. 787. The statements on the subject, to which reference has been made in previous issues of this Report, issued by the Eederation of British Industries, the Railway Companies&apos; Association, and the Associated Chambers of Commerce, were also considered, and it was decided to prepare a statement on the whole problem and issue it to the full executives of the three unions for their approval.There are indications that the railwaymen will maintain their claim to a share in control at whatever cost may be necessary. Mr. Thomas, in his recent speech at the International Railwaymen&apos;s Conference in London, spoke in this sense and hinted that the unions would demand &quot; real&quot; control as distinct from representation on the advisory committees suggested by Lord Churchill in his letter to the Minister of Transport on the attitude of the Railway Companies&apos; Association to the official proposals.Industrial and Other Organisations.Amalgamated Weavers&apos; Association. The arrangements proposed by this association, which involve amendments of existing rules, in order that the constituent bodies may
* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 1, 1st January, p. 3. f See this Report, Vol. II, No. 23, ith December, p. 631,become eligible to adminster benefit under Section 17 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, have already been referred to in this report.* It was noted there that ,the proposed scheme had been rejected by three of the district associations, namely, the Burnley and District Weavers, Winders and Beamers&apos; Association, the Nelson and District Weavers&apos; Association and the Padiham and District Weavers, Winders and Warpers&apos; Association. It is*now reported that the question has again been considered by the governing body of the Amalgamated Weavers&apos; Association, who have decided that no local society which refuses to make arrangements to administer benefit under the Act may remain a member of the Amalgamation. It is understood that efforts are still being made to settle the difficulty, but the crisis which exists is regarded in some quarters as very serious.National Union of Scottish Mine Workers. With reference to the unofficial reform movement of Scottish miners,! the latest development is a conference of delegates, representing miners from Fifeshirc, Stirlingshire, East and West Lothian, Ayrshire, Lanarkshire and Dumbartonshire, was held on the 3rd January at Glasgow. At this conference the existing miners&apos; unions were severely criticised as &quot; obsolete &quot; and in need of revision. The chairman, in his opening address, insisted that the standard of living for miners should be regulated not by output or prices, but by the cost of living plus a margin for comfort.The following questions were discussed : One union for Scotland; the new wages agreement; the 5-day week and the 6-hour day ; miners&apos; agents ; election of officials. A demand was also made for a share in the control of the mining industry, a better standard of life, improvements at the pithead and one union for Great Britain. With regard to the last demand it was unanimously agreed that Scottish miners should form one union for Scotland, before any attempt could be made to found one strong union for workers in all the British coal areas.   Plan for its formation were discussed.Mr. Jordan, the chairman of the conference, Avas elected president of the union, and Mr. W. C. Kirker, Bowhill, was appointed secretary ; Mr. Hafferty and Mr. H. McKerrell were appointed treasurers. It was decided that Scotland should be divided into 10 areas for the purpose of representation, and that two delegates from each district should be nomi-nated to the Central Board for administrative purposes. A committee of 12 members of the conference ^was appointed to draft rules for submission to a conference to be held on the 14th February.. A resolution was also passed requesting the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain to take steps to fulfil all pledges with regard to obtaining advances to colliery workers other than miners.Trade Union Topics.Amalgamated Engineering Umon.-The result of the first ballot for the election of a general secretary of this union was announced on the 1st January. There were 30 candi-dates and the first six candidates on the poll were Messrs. J. Kaylor, A. H. Smethurst, W. H. Robinson, R. H. Coates, A. R. Swales, and W. McLaine. A final ballot will be taken later to decide between Mr. Kaylor and Mr. Smethurst. Mr. Kaylor is a member of the union executive, whilst Mr. Smethurst is assistant secretary. Mr. W. McLaine, who came sixth on the list, is a prominent member of the Communist Party of Great Britain.Another ballot recently taken among members of this union has resulted in favour of a levy of Is. per member per week for the purpose of providing extra benefit for unem-ployed members. Extra rates of 5s. and 10s. per week will be paid to single and married men respectively ; the latter will also receive 2s. Qd. per week for each child under 14 years of age, up to a maximum of three children.Trade Union Amalgamations. The formation of the following new unions, by amalgamation, which take effect from the 1st January, 1921, are announced in addition to those recorded in last week&apos;s Report :-The United Operative Masons&apos; Association of Scotland, being an amalgamation of the original society bearing this name with the United Operative Masons and -Granite Workers&apos; Union, the Glasgow and District Tilelaycrs&apos; Association, and the Scottish Associated Paviors&apos; Federal Union (Glasgow). It is also announced that a ballot will shortly be taken of the members of the new union on the question of affiliation to the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives.The National Union of Sheet Metal Workers and Braziers, being an amalgamation of the General Union of Braziers and Sheet Metal Workers, the National Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers and Braziers (attached branches), the City of Dublin Tinsmiths and Sheet&apos;.Metal Workers&apos; Society, the Scottish Sheet Metal Workers and Braziers&apos; Friendly and Protective Society, the Wolverhampton
Operative Sheet Metal Workers and Braziers&apos; Society, the Oldham Sheet Metal Workers&apos; Trade Union, the Bradford and District Sheet Metal Workers&apos; Society, the Leeds and District Trade and Friendly Society of Sheet Metal Workers, the Sheet Metal Workers of Edinburgh and Leith Protecting and Friendly Society, the Galvanised Hollow-ware Sheet Metal Workers and Braziers&apos; Association, the Belfast Sheet Metal Workers and Gas Fitters&apos; Trade Union, the Aberdeen and District Sheet Metal Workers&apos; Society, the Exeter and District Sheet Metal Workers and Braziers&apos; Society, the Bristol Sheet Metal Workers and Braziers&apos; Society, the London Society of Sheet Metal Workers, Bra-ziers and Gas Meter Makers, the Progressive Sheet Metal Workers&apos; Society (Coventry), the Ashton-under-Lyne and District Braziers and Sheet Metal Workers, the Dundee and District Sheet Metal Workers, Gas Fitters and Braziers&apos; Protecting and Friendly Society, and the Women Tin Box and General Workers&apos; Union (Manchester).Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union. The movement for bringing flour-mill workers, especially those organised by the National Union of Millers, within a special section of this union, to be named the &quot; National Amalgamated Milling Section,&quot; was referred to in this Report, Vol. II, No. 25,18th December, p. 680. It is now possible to give further details of the movement, though there is nothing to add to the main result as stated then, namely, the constitution of a &quot; national provisional committee,&quot; within the machinery of the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union, to watch the interests of the National Amalgamated Milling Section, and, in particular, to formulate policy, frame a wages programme, and develop organisation. The existence of the Amalgamated Milling Section and its committee may have considerable influence upon the National Joint Indus-trial Council for the flour milling industry.The amalgamation movement culminated in a conference at Birmingham on the 11th and 12th December, comprising representatives of all the local branches which will be organised in the new section of the dockers&apos; union. At this meeting the &quot; National Provisional Committee,&quot; referred to above, was set up, and Mr. P. C. Green, general secre-tary of the National Union of Millers, was appointed to act as national secretary for the Amalgamated Milling Section. The first stage of the movement was the absorption, by the National Union of Millers, of the Birmingham and Western Midland Counties Flour Mill Workers&apos; Association, and-the Liverpool Milling Section of the Bakers&apos; Union. The transfer of the members of the augmented National Union of Millers to the Milling Section of the dockers&apos; union is a second and subsequent process. The Birmingham conference will be the first of a series of annual conferences of the milling section so that the national policy of the union on all matters affecting the flourmiHing industry will be determined by workers engaged in the industry.It is reported that it has been decided to consider the possibility of setting up a maintenance scheme for the trade to cover unemployment or trade depression.From the legal and technical point of view, the second stage of the movement has not yet been completed, but the current issue of the Dockers&apos; Record shows that in many districts the absorption of the local branches of Hour-mill workers into the ordinary district machinery of the dockers&apos; union is proceeding apace. This is especially the case with regard to the Birmingham and Hull districts of the union.Three points of more general interest emerge from these events. The National Union of Millers is a comparatively new union, being formed in April, 1913, after what was regarded as the failure of the various general workers&apos; unions to organise successfully the workers in the flour milling industry. The history of the union has therefore been a departure from the customary mode of trade union organisation among this class of workers. Secondly, the existence during the war of the flour mills control committee, and after the war, of a Joint Industrial Council for the industry, appear to have been of considerable value in forwarding the unification movement. Lack of co-operation amongst the employers, however, has been perhaps a more notable feature than lack of organisation among the workers in the industry. Thirdly, the events show how the trade union movement is complicated by the amalgamation movement. During the last few months, it may be said that flour-mill workers were affected by three separate sections of amalgamation movements; the amalgamation with the National Union of Millers of the two other bodies of flour-mill workers already referred to ; the absorption of these three bodies within the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union; and the great amalgamation scheme affecting 19 members of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, which has been frequently dealt with in this Report.United Vehicle Workers:-It is reported that this body is now taking steps to form a co-operative organisation, under the name of the &quot; Transport Co-operative Society,&quot; for
NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Building Trades Operatives (National). The National Conciliation Board for the Build-ing Trades at their last meeting discussed the suggestion of the chairman that, with a view to the stabilisation of present conditions, all notices from both sides should be withdrawn and no further notices should be given for 12 months. While refraining from making any recommendation on the proposal, the Board decided that there was no objection to the joint secretaries conveying the suggestion to the constituent bodies. It is understood that action on these lines is being taken.Copper Trade Workers (South Wales). Proposals have been formulated by the employers in the South Wales copper trade for a 5 per cent, reduction in wages as from the 1st February.Tinplate Workers (South Wales) . The new sliding scale now in operation for process workers in the South Wales Tinplate trade has resulted in varying reductions to workers according to their basic rates. The maintenance men, craftsmen and other day-workers were not included in the new agreement. The executive of the Welsh Plate and Sheet Manufacturers&apos; Association have now requested a special meeting of the sliding scale joint committee, to consider a proposal that the consolidation of half the 50 per cent, special bonus with basis earnings be discontinued, and payment made upon the basic rate, plus the war bonus percentage, and 50 per cent, special bonus. The adoption of this proposal would involve a reduction for skilled men amounting approximately to 15s. a week.Electric Lamp Makers (National). Convened by the National Federation of General Workers, a conference of affiliated unions, held in London on the 5th J anuary, to consider the wages of men employed in the manufacture of electric lamps, batteries and accumu-lators, decided to make application to the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations for an extension to the workmen concerned of the rates of wages obtaining generally in the engineering trades.Railwaymen (National). In connection with the difficulty which has arisen between the National Union of Railwaymen and the Standing Committee of General Managers over the question of the constitution of the Appeal Boards,* a statement appears in the Railway Gazette for the 7th January to the effect that an agreed compromise had been effected, according to which, of the three workers&apos; representatives, two should be employees of the railway company, having knowledge of the conditions of employment of the men concerned in the appeal, and one should be a member of the executive committee of the union. When the executive of the union later informed the committee that they were appointing two of their members, instead of one as ag;reed, this was interpreted as a cancellation of the previous arrangement, which left the Standing Committee of General Managers free to put forward alternative proposals.Vehicle Builders (England and Wales). The National Federation of Vehicle Trades have given two months&apos; notice to the unions engaged in the vehicle building industry for a reduction of 3d. an hour for journeymen, and an increase in the week from 47 to 48 hours.   The notice expires on the 28th February.(b 16853T)* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 1,1st January, p. 7.Gthe purpose of establishing road transport services to compete with those conducted by private companies. It is proposed to start services of motor omnibuses outside London, and to develop the existing co-operative omnibus services which were inaugurated by members of the union in the Folkestone area during a strike some months ago. Proposals for a fleet of co-operative taxi-cabs and commercial motor lorries are also under consideration.
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.Brewers (South Wales). The South Wales Brewery Workers&apos; Joint Committee, an organisation composed of representatives of the Workers&apos; Union, the National Union of General Workers and the Municipal Employees&apos; Association, have formulated demands for increased wages and improved working conditions. The South Wales Brewers&apos; Asso-ciation, however, rejected the demands, particularly on account of a clause compelling all employees to be trade union members. The Joint Committee have now substituted for this clause another withholding from non-union employees any concessions granted as a result of the present negotiations. A similar demand has been made to the Mon-mouthshire Brewers&apos; Association.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Building Trades Operatives (Belfast). Building trades operatives at Belfast struck on the 1st January, in consequence of the termination of the wages agreement with the Belfast Master Builders&apos; Association on the 31st December, and the association^ proposal for an increase in the working week from 44 to 48 hours and a reduction in wages from 2s. 5d. to 2s. an hour.Settlements and Agreements.Colliery Examiners (South Wales). The South Wales and Monmouthshire Colliery Examiners and Overmen&apos;s Association have negotiated an agreement with the Monmouth-shire and South Wales Coal Owners&apos; Association which secures the consolidation of all war advances into one wage-rate, an increase of 10s. a week, and the payment of additional advances for increased production.Brewers (Burton). As a result of recent negotiations between the Burton-on-Trent Brewers&apos; Association and the Workers&apos; Union, an increase of 5s. a week has been obtained for men, and 3s. Qd. for women, for the period from the first pay-day in January until the 30th June, 1921.[Other disputes, negotiations, and settlements are referred to in the Industrial Relations Department section of the Report, pages 51 to 55.]
5115.1.21.PART IL-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DEPARTMENT.ENGINEERING, SHIPBUILDING AND ALLIED TRADES.Optical Instruments.--!)^ Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee, on the 5th January, considered the draft apprenticeship scheme, as amended by the special sub-committee. The report was agreed, subject to slight variations in the wages rates, which are to be submitted by the workers&apos; side to the executive committee of the Amal-gamated Engineering Union for approval. A letter from the Minister, recommending the adoption of short time where practicable, was considered, and the secretary of the employers&apos; association was instructed to collect data showing the amount of short time at present being worked, with a view to the possibility of further measures along the lines suggested by the Ministers letter. A resolution urging the Government to prohibit the importation of optical instruments was defeated, the workers&apos; side opposing.Gold, Silver, Horological and Allied Trades. The general secretary of the National Union of Gold, Silver and Allied Trades called to discuss the present position between the Birmingham branch of his union, and the Birmingham Jewellery, Silver, Electro-Plate and Allied Trades Union. He stated that at present there appears to be no prospect of amalgamation between the tv/o unions, though he hoped that it would eventually be possible. He did not consider that at the moment it would be of any use for the depart-ment to make further attempts in the direction of bringing the parties together. In his opinion the root of the trouble was that the Birmingham employers have got themselves into a position from which they could scarcely retire with dignity. On the question of admitting the Birmingham union to the Joint Industrial Council without previous amal-gamation with his own union, he was emphatic that this could not be done until the Birmingham union had proved their bona fides to the Trades Union Congress.Road and Sewer Construction: Strike of Navvies (Bellingham and Roehampton).-The labourers engaged by Messrs. R. McAlpine &amp; Sons on road and sewer work in con-nection with the Bellingham housing scheme have hitherto been paid 2s. Id. per hour, the rate applicable to builders&apos; labourers in the London district. Under Industrial Court Award No. 444 as interpreted in Award No. 500, the rate of Is. lid. per hour was fixed for labourers engaged on road and sewer work, whether in connection with a housing scheme or not. In accordance with instructions from the London County Council, the firm posted a notice to the effect that the rate for road and sewer construction would be Is. lid per hour from the 29th December. On that date about 1,400 workmen struck as a protest. At the same time about 200 navvies ceased work on the Roehampton housing scheme as a protest against a similar reduction.A deputation from the unions of bricklayers&apos; labourers and constructional workers bricklayers, navvies, general labourers, carpenters and scaffolders, approached the London County Council, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Labour, and urged that, as 2s. Id. per hour was paid to labourers engaged on the housing scheme whose work in many instances was neither more arduous nor more skilled, the proposed rate for road work was unjust and would lead to great labour trouble on the London housing schemes.It was explained by the Ministry of Labour that the rate of Is. lid. for this work had been fixed by the Industrial Court, but the deputation stated that in their opinion the Awards did not apply to road and sewer work which formed part of one housing contract. They admitted, however, that the work in dispute would have been undertaken by a public works contractor, and not by a master builder, if the contract had been divided up. They argued that the Awards ignored the practical difficulties that would follow any attempt to pay navvies on trench work a rate lower than the rate paid to builders&apos; labourers or to unskilled labourers engaged, for example, in loading bricks for a bricklayer. They also urged that the conditions of navvies&apos; work on the Bellingham site were exceptionally unpleasant. It was pointed out that all these arguments had doubtless been put before the Court by their representative.  If, however, the deputation felt that the matter required(B 16853T)G 2
discussion by persons familiar with the practical side of the trade, the Ministry would suggest that the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives should ask for an immediate meeting of the Public Works Conciliation Board to discuss the question. If an early meeting could be arranged, the department undertook to make representations to the Ministry of Health as to action by the contractor pending that meeting.It was suggested to the Ministry of Health by the Ministry of Labour that the con-tractors should be instructed to put into operation the Award as from the 29th December, giving Is. lid. per hour on road and sewer work for a week of 47 hours; but in order that there should be no reduction in weekly wages, pending the meeting of the Conciliation Board, the contractor might be authorised to make up to the men their previous wages of 2s. Id. for 44 hours. This would be entirely ex gratia, and only for a period to allow time for a meeting of the Public Works Conciliation Board.On the 30th December the men returned to work on the Bellingham scheme on the understanding that their claims would be considered as proposed by the Ministry of Labour, and that in the meantime their weekly earnings would not be reduced. It is reported that the men returned to work at Roehampton on the same understanding.FOOD AND DRINK.Bakers (Swansea). The Press report a raid on bakeries by the strikers, because of the employment of ex-Service men at wages in excess of trade union rates. The Swansea Labour Association have written to headquarters, stating that the men will return to work on the understanding that the case shall be submitted to arbitration, and requesting the departments assistance in persuading the employers to agree to this course. The association also state that it is becoming difficult to obtain bread. By the efforts of the Chief Conciliation Officer a meeting of employers was convened, at which they decided to communicate with the operatives&apos; branch secretary, offering a resumption of work on existing conditions. The union are putting forward a counter-proposal that work should be resumed provided that existing rates are stabilised until there has been a fall of an agreed number of points in the cost-of-living figures.Scottish Bakers -Further settlements have been effected, some on the 7s. Qd. and some on the 5s. 9d. basis. No increases, however, have been conceded at Forfar, Peterhead, Dingwall and Banchory. It is reported that, instead, the East Scotland master bakers have reduced the price of the 1oaf by a halfpenny. At Ayr the position is apparently unchanged, and at Arbroath negotiations are still in progress. At Hawick the strike, of 56 men and 8 apprentices, continues. The employers&apos; attitude is probably determined by the acute depression in the textile industry. Two firms have, however, conceded the 7s. Qd. increase. Minor strikes continue at about nine other small towns, where the total number of employees now concerned is probably less than 70.Cocoa, Chocolate, Sugar Confectionery and Jam. The Interim Industrial Recon-struction Committee met on the 5th January. It was reported that, owing to the great difference in the wages of chocolate workers and sugar confectionery workers, firms who make only a small amount of chocolate objected to paying the high rates agreed for chocolate workers. It was agreed to allow such firms the right of appeal to the Council, and that the General Purposes Committee should consider the possibility of grading these workers. A constitution for works committees was adopted. A resolution proposed by the workers of Messrs. Rowntree &amp; Co., Ltd., that all shops throughout the industry shall be union shops, was not accepted by the employers. It was agreed, however, that any firm could enter into such an undertaking with their workers if they wished.Flour Milling. An emergency meeting of the Joint Industrial Council was held on the 7th January to consider the question of unemployment in the industry. After a statement by the chairman of the employers&apos; federation, to the effect that in his opinion the demand for flour would be normal in a few weeks, and that therefore unemployment would cease, an agreement was made that pending the meeting of the Executive Com-mittee on the 19th January to go into the whole question of unemployment, the Flour Millers&apos; Federation recommend that no mill should work any overtime ; that no extension of short time take place ; and that, where short time is already in operation, no man is to lose more than one day&apos;s pay per week, and in the London mill of Messrs. J. Rank, Ltd., no man shall lose more than four hours per week.Fishing Industry (Grimsby). The Chief Labour Adviser met a deputation of trawler owners on the 3rd January as arranged.  They stated the need of the industry for a
reduction of working expenses, and produced figures in support of this. They also expressed the view that skippers and mates were satisfied and that, in the event of a strike, 80 per cent, would still go to sea.The Chief Labour Adviser explained fully the powers of the Ministry in regard to Courts of Inquiry, and said that the decision as to setting up such a Court rested with the Minister, who would have to consider whether the situation called for such action. He explained also the different forms of courts of arbitration, and emphasised the value of assessors thereon. The deputation expressed their disinclination to arbitration, but agreed to report on the interview to their Federation. The Federation have since definitely declined arbitration.The District Inspector of the Humber Area, in an interview on the 6th January, expressed the view that the owners intend to reduce wages in the near future, and that the men, anticipating this, are determined to force the issue now.ROAD TRANSPORT.Wages Agreement: Request for Ratification. As the result of recent negotiations between the London Cartage and Haulage Contractors&apos; Association and the Motor Transport Employers&apos; Federation on the one hand, and the National Union of Vehicle Workers and the United Vehicle Workers on the other, an agreement was reached by which the men employed in the road transport industry in the London area were to receive an advance of 4s. per week from the 11th December. The parties have approached the department with a request that this agreement should be referred to the Industrial Court, or countersigned by the department, in order to get the terms of agreement adopted generally by the trade, and also by the Government departments and municipal authorities throughout the London area.They were informed that the considerations leading to the request were appreciated, but that it was contrary to the general policy of the department, which is to leave each industry as far as possible to settle its own problems without intervention by the Govern-ment. In view of this, the department could not agree to the course suggested. As regards reference to the Industrial Court, it was pointed out that it is the practice of the department not to refer to the Court matters already settled by agreement between the parties. Regarding the difficulties anticipated with public authorities, they were informed that it was not expected that Government departments will refuse to recognise the agreement merely on the ground that it is not in the form of an award, or countersigned by this depart-ment, and that in any case in which a municipal authority is concerned, the department would be prepared, if desired, to advise the authority as to the course which they should adopt, having regard to the &quot; Fair Wages &quot; clause generally inserted in municipal contracts.CHEMICALS AND EXPLOSIVES.Chemical Trade. Advances were granted by the Industrial Court to men aged 21 years and over, of 4s. per week, or Sd. per day or shift, to time-workers not in receipt of the 12J per cent, bonus, and of 3s. 6d. per week, or 7d. per day or shift, to time-workers in receipt of the 12J per cent, bonus. Boys and youths, 18 years of age and over but under 21, and women 18 years of age and over, were granted an advance of 2s. Qd. per week. Equivalent advances were granted to piece-workers.   (Award No. 589.)Soap and Candle Trades. Advances were granted similar to those given above.-(Award No. 592.)PRINTING AND PAPER.Manufactured Stationery. On the 5th January, the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee decided to recommend the employers to grant an increase of 5s., dating from the first pay-day in the week beginning the 12th December, 1920, to male members of the bookbinding section employed in the industry. The application for an increase of 5s. to all other workers in the industry was postponed for three months, owing to the unsatisfactory state of trade in the industry.PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND PUBLIC UTILITY SERVICES.Electricity Sujiply. A conference of representatives of the outstanding undertakings in the South Wales and Monmouthshire area, namely, Swansea, Newport, Llanelly, and Pontypridd, and of the Electrical Power Engineers&apos; Association, was held at Cardiff on the
6th January, to consider the difference between the undertakings and the association in regard to the adoption of the schedule of salaries and conditions of employment recom-mended by the National Joint Board of Employers and Staff Members. After discussion, the association^ representatives agreed that action in regard to the undertakings should again be suspended, till the 21st January, to enable the councils or committees of the undertakings to agree to adopt the schedule and conditions, subject to any anomalies or difficulties of interpretation being referred for adjustment to the District Joint Board for the area.A conference of representatives of the Newport Corporation and of the Electricity Supply Commercial Association was held at Newport on the 7th January, to deal with the difference in regard to the adoption of the schedule of salaries for clerical staffs recom-mended by the National Joint Board. It was agreed that the difference be referred to the Corporation and the local branch of the association.GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.Air Ministry. -At a meeting of the Industrial Council on the 5th January the following resolution was submitted by the trade union side : &quot; That the workers&apos; representatives of this Council, whilst fully appreciating the serious industrial situation consequent on the large number of unemployed workers, hereby express their surprise that the Cabinet should propose to introduce a system of shorter working hours in Government establish-ments without having consulted this and the other Governmental Industrial Councils. We are compelled to decline to participate in the application of the scheme until we have had full opportunity of discussing it together with any possible alternative.&quot;The view was expressed by the trade union side that the application of any short-time scheme to Government industrial establishments should be as far as possible on uniform lines, the details of which should be agreed between the Government and the trade unions represented on the departmental Trade Joint Councils. After considerable discussion, the chairman intimated that the official side were not in a position to accept the resolution, but that he would refer it to the proper quarter for consideration.After the meeting the secretary of the trade union side suggested that a conference of representatives of all the Government Industrial Councils might enable the trade unions to reach an agreement with the Government on a short-time scheme.*War Office. A joint deputetion from the Joint Industrial Council visited Woolwich Arsenal on the 6th January, to explain the Council&apos;s proposals for setting up department and shop committees in certain departments. Representatives were present from the Ordnance Department, and the departments of the Chief Inspector of Royal Engineer Stores, and the Chief Inspector of Stores and Clothing; both officers and trade union representatives attended. The proposals were not unfavourably received, and the meeting was adjourned for a fortnight in order that the workers&apos; representatives might consult their unions.MISCELLANEOUS TRADES.Co-operative Workers. With reference to the dispute between the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative and Commercial Employees and Allied Workers, and the Co-operative Union, Ltd., the Chief Conciliation Officer attended a meeting of the Hours and Wages Board of the union on the 6th January, and suggested that the points at issue could be dealt with either by referring the matter to arbitration, or by way of conciliation under a neutral chairman. The Board agreed to the last procedure, and a meeting between the parties, with the Chief Conciliation Officer as chairman, has been arranged for the 18th January.PROFESSIONAL WORKERS.Insurance Workers.-The strike of insurance officials continues. At a meeting between the Board of Directors of the General Accident, Fire and Life Assurance Corporation and an officer of the Ministry on the 29th December, the Board were disinclined to move from the official position which they have taken up throughout, and insisted that complete loyalty to the Corporation must be a condition of promotion. It is reported that on the 6th January, at a meeting of representatives of 47 associations of non-manual workers, a resolution was carried asking the Minister to receive a deputation in order that all avenues towards a settlement of this dispute might be explored. It was also decided that the guild should call all known insurance organisations to their aid in the dispute.* See pages 44 and 45 above.
GENERAL DEPARTMENT.TRADE BOARDS.PROCEEDINGS.Boot and Shoe Repairing Trade Board (Great Britain). The Northern and North Wales District Trade Committees agreed to recommend the variation of the minimum rates of wages for male and female workers as suggested by the Board. Separate recom-mendations on this subject, however, were made to the Board by the representatives of employers and workers on the Eastern, London, and.South-Eastern District Trade Com-mittees. These five District Trade Committees also considered a draft of a Notice of Proposal to vary the minimum rates of wages for male apprentices, and agreed to recom-mend the Board to vary the minimum rates as proposed.The Northern District Trade Committee agreed to recommend the Board to take such action as may be necessary to render it obligatory on employers to inform their workers, on the previous day, when occasion arises, that there is not sufficient work on hand to employ them fully on the following day.Objection was taken by certain members of the South-Eastern District Trade Committee to the constitution of the committee, and a deputation on the matter waited upon the Minister.GENERAL.Constitution of Industrial Courts. On the 9th November, a deputation from the Flour Milling Joint Industrial Council waited upon the Chief Labour Adviser in connection with the following resolution passed by the Executive Committee: &quot; That in the opinion of this Council, when a matter of wages or classification or interpretation, arising out of an agreement made by an Industrial Council, in connection with a non-federated firm, is referred by the Ministry of Labour to arbitration under the Industrial Courts Act, the Court should consist of 5 persons; one to be appointed by the employers&apos; representatives and one by the work-peopled representatives on the Industrial Council concerned, and 3, including an independent chairman, to be appointed by the Ministry of Labour.&quot;In reply to a letter asking whether the Minister had arrived at any conclusion with regard to the resolution, the secretary of the Council has been informed as follows : &quot; That reference to arbitration is voluntary, and that, under the provisions of the Industrial Courts Act, the form of tribunal is a matter for the parties concerned. In these circumstances the department cannot give any undertaking of the kind suggested in the resolution adopted by the Council. That, on the subject of the appointment of assessors, drawn from the members of the Council, to sit with the Industrial Court, it is open to the Court, under the rules of the Court, if they think fit, to call in the aid of assessors. The question whether assessors, if desired, should be selected from the Council is one which must be settled at the time in consultation with the interests affected, and is not one in regard to which the department can at this stage express an opinion. It is open to the Court to call for such evidence, or for the parties to submit such evidence, as may be thought advisable, in the course of the hearing.&quot;Establishment of Local &apos;:Body to deal with Industrial Disputes. Following the recent carters&apos; dispute, the Town Clerk of Bradford requested the Ministers views on a proposal made by a member of the Bradford City Council for the establishment of a new body in Bradford to deal with any industrial disputes which may arise locally, the suggested tribunal to consist of ten or a dozen well-known Bradford men, including representatives of labour. It was urged by the councillor concerned, that the reference of disputes to such a body would result in matters being dealt with more promptly. The Minister has replied that, while sympathising with the motives which prompt it, he doubts whether the proposal is likely to be really useful in securing industrial peace, and expresses the opinion that the solution lies in the creation of adequate joint machinery on a national basis in every industry, with district machinery to deal with local matters, and works committees to deal with domestic affairs in particular works.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Industrial Relations will be found also on pages 42 to 50, and 55 to 61.]
General Department-continued.The North Wales District Trade Committee agreed to recommend to the Board that any investigations required in connection with applications from their district for permits of exemption and the registration of apprentices be referred to the members of their committee.Cotton Waste Reclamation Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board, after considering objections to the proposed minimum rates and the report from the Scottish District Trade Committee on the proposed rates for Scotland, agreed to fix them as proposed. The Board delegated their powers of granting permits of exemption to a standing committee. It was agreed to inform the Minister that his proposal regarding short time had already been widely adopted, so far as the circumstances of the trade permitted. The Board considered resolutions from the women&apos;s sub-committees of the Perth and Plymouth Employment Committees, and agreed that the unskilled nature of their trade made unnecessary any provision for learnership, and made it desirable that the adult age for females should be regarded as 18 years. The Board further agreed that there was no opportunity in their trade for co-operation with Juvenile Advisory Committees.General Waste Materials Reclamation Trade Board (Great Britain). The minimum rates to be proposed for male workers were discussed at length, but further consideration was deferred.It was agreed that copies of the letter from the Minister on the subject of the working of universal short time should be circulated to employers&apos; associations and trade unions represented on the Board.FIXING AND VARIATION OF MINIMUM RATES OF WAGES.General Waste Materials Reclamation Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board have issued a Notice of Proposal, dated the 3rd January, to fix general minimum time-rates, guaranteed time-rates, piece-work basis time-rates and overtime rates for female workers.The general minimum time-rates and guaranteed time-rates proposed for female workers,. 18 years of age or over, are, in the waste paper and paper stock materials section of the trade, 8$d. per hour ; in the woollen rag or woollen and worsted waste materials section in the West Riding of York-shire, 9fflE. per hour, and in other areas, 9jd. per hour ; in other sections of the trade, 8^d. per hour. Lower rates are proposed for younger workers. The corresponding piece-work basis time-rates are 10d.; ll^d., 10JW. and 9 dL per hour, respectively.The overtime rates proposed for time-workers or piece-workers are, for the first two hours of overtime on any day except Sunday and customary public and statutory holidays, time-and-a-quarter; for overtime after the first two hours on any day except Sunday and customary public and statutory holidays, time-and-a-half; for all time worked on Sunday and customary public and statutory holidays, double time ; and for all hours worked in any week in excess of 48, time-and-a-quarter, except in so far as higher overtime rates are payable. For the purpose of these overtime rates the Board have declared the normal number of hours of work to be 48 in any week, 8f on any week-day other than Saturday, and 4J on Saturday.Hat, Cap and Millinery Trade Board (Ireland). The Board have issued a Notice of Proposal, dated the 7th January, to fix general minimum time-rates, a piece-work basis time-rate and overtime rates for certain classes of female workers.The general minimum time-rate and piece-work basis time-rate proposed for female workers, other than learners and.home workers, who have not attained the age of 22, or who, having attained the age of 22, have not had three years&apos; experience after learnership in the trade, and who are engaged in the retail branch of the trade in other areas than those of the county boroughs or cities of Dublin, Belfast, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Londonderry, are 8d. per hour and dd. per hour, respectively. Lower general minimum time-rates, fixed according to age of commencement and length of service in the trade, are proposed for female learners as defined by the Board.The overtime rates proposed for female workers, whether employed on time-work or on piece-work, are, for overtime on any day except Saturday or the weekly short day substituted therefor, Sunday and customary public and statutory holidays, for the first two hours, time-and-a-quarter, and after the first two hours, time-and-a-half; for all time worked on Saturday or the weekly short day after the first five hours, time-and-a-half; for all time worked on Sunday and customary public and statutory holidays, double time ; for all hours worked in any week in excess of 48, time-and-a-quarter, except in so far as higher overtime rates are payable. For the purpose of these overtime rates the Board have declared the normal number of hours of work to be 48 in any week, and 9 on any week-day other than Saturday or the weekly short day.Retail Bespoke Tailoring Trade Board (Ireland).-The Board have issued a Notice of Proposal, dated the 6th January, to vary and to fix general minimum time-rates and piece-work basis time-rates for certain classes of female workers.The general minimum time-rate proposed is ll^d. per hour, and the piece-work basis time-rate Is. 0^. per hour, for female workers employed in areas administered by Rural District Councils,
General Department-continued.Urban District Councils or other local authorities, having a population not exceeding 2,000 as returned at the last Census. The corresponding rates proposed for workers employed in other areas are la. and Is. Id., respectively.These rates are applicable to workers of 20 years of age and over, with not less than 4 years&apos; experience in any branch of the trade, employed making cassocks, soutanes, clerical cloaks, municipal and judicial robes ; on the constructional parts of coats ; as vest makers, skirt makers, trouser makers, and breeches makers ; making ladies&apos; and gentlemen&apos;s coats where the garment is made throughout by one worker ; and as machinists who do the whole machining on a garment.Tobacco Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board have issued a Notice of Proposal, dated the 4th January, to vary the overtime rate3 for male and female workers.The overtime rates proposed for time-workers or piece-workers are, for the first two hours over-time on any day except Sunday and customary public and statutory holidays, time-and-a-quarter ; for overtime after the first two hours on any day except Sunday and customary public and statutory holidays, time-and-a-half; for all time worked on Sunday and customary public and statutory holidays, double time; and for all hours worked in any week in excess of 48, time-and-a-quarter, except in so far as higher overtime rates are payable. For the purpose of these overtime rates the Board declare the normal number of hours of work to be 48 in any week ; 9 on any week-day other than Saturday; and 5 on Saturday. Where it is, or may become, the established practice of an employer to require attendance only on five days a week, overtime shall be payable on such days only after 9  hours have been worked.EMPLOYMENT AND INSURANCE DEPARTMENT.EMPLOYMENT EXCHANGES.The Unemployment Position.The following table shows the work of the Exchanges in respect of registrations, vacancies, and placings during the week ending the 31st December: 	Men.

While this increase may, to some extent, be accounted for by the prolonged Christmas holiday, which in many districts has been extended to the 10th January, there is unfortunately no evidence in the reports that, when work is resumed after the holiday suspensions, any immediate improvement in the general situation may be anticipated. The view, is taken in some districts that the lowest ebb of the trade depression has not yet been reached.Shipbuilding and Allied Industries^Work in the yards on the Clyde is very slack, and in consequence of the cancellation of a considerable number of contracts the outlook is not promising. On Tyneside unemployment among skilled workers is increasing as a result of the joiners&apos; strike, and, on the Wear and Tees, workmen are being paid off each week as contracts are finished. On the Mersey, shipbuilding and ship-repairing work is still dull; and the non-settlement of the joiners&apos; strike tends to retard any progress which
Employment and Insurance Department-continued.might otherwise be made. In South Wales, work in the ship-repairing industry has not yet been fully resumed after the holidays. There is, however, quite a large surplus of both skilled and unskilled labour at all ports in this district. In general, the position is no better, and the prospects so far as can be ascertained are not good.Local Reports. The North-Western Division report that the position as regards unemployment is almost without precedent, and during the past week matters have grown steadily worse. The depression in this district is not confined to the cotton industry, but embraces most trades. Not only are all cotton towns at their lowest ebb in employ-ment, but at the same time Chester, a county town and agricultural centre, Crewe, an important railway and wholesale clothing centre, and Lancaster, which covers an agri-cultural district and is the centre of the linoleum trade, are also in a similar position.In the lace trade, as a result of a recent conference between manufacturers and finishers, definite prices have now been arranged and in consequence it is hoped that business will accrue in the near future. There has been no improvement in the hosiery trade.   It is believed in some quarters that, as prices become stable, trade will improve.The pottery industry, while not so brisk as it has been, is still being carried on without the necessity of large discharges. The saddle and harness industry is almost at a standstill and, owing to a lack of orders, a considerable number of workers in the chain industry have been discharged. In the iron and steel trade, Sheffield report that a large contract for the repair of rolling stock has been received from &quot;Eoumania, and, while this mny not have any immediate effects, it should ultimately absorb some of the surplus labour.In the South Wales area the position of the tinplate and steel industry is very serious ; upwards of 12,000 workers are affected by the closing down of works and the introduction of short-time working.Birmingham report that the general outlook in the engineering and metal trades is no brighter and that the sporting gun trade, which has hitherto enjoyed comparative prosperity, is now beginning to feel the depression in trade. Up to tire present, however, the large firms in this area have managed to keep the bulk of their employees on full time.In London the factories engaged in the leather trade, tin box making, furniture and food products are very slack.Industrial Developments.-Leith report that the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society are commencing the reconstruction of their machinery in the Chancelot Mills. The outlay involved is between  40,000 and  50,000. There is a prospect of the sugar-houses at Greenock restarting work, at an early date.Labour Reductions. Messrs. Maple &amp; Co., Ltd., London, have discharged 300 work-people from their various departments. Dartford report that during the week 400 workers have been discharged by Messrs. Vickers, Ltd. Luton report that 80 per cent, of the staff of Commercial Cars, Ltd., have been discharged, and at Derby the British Cellulose &amp; Chemical Manufacturing Co., Ltd., are dismissing men in batches of 50 to 100.Transport. The position of transport workers at all South Wales ports cannot be regarded as serious, although there is a considerable surplus of labour. Ordinarily during the winter months imports are light, as, apart from pitwood and. general cargo, there is at this time of the year little tonnage entering the Bristol Channel.In the London area work at the docks and on the riverside is extremely quiet. Much unskilled labour from other districts is attracted to the neighbourhood of the docks in the hope of obtaining a day&apos;s work, and this has the effect of crowding out the local dock labourer.The position at Grimsby and Hull is unchanged, but at Liverpool the Dock Board have dismissed 600 to 1,000 men for a fortnights holiday, an action on the part of the Board which is almost unprecedented.Women&apos;s Employment.General Situation. Reports show no improvement; extended holidays, short time and general unemployment continue. The Exchanges draw attention to the increased number of applicants for unemployment insurance benefit; in the larger industrial centres a great strain is imposed both on staff and premises.Local Reports. The North-Western Division report that the unemployment situation has undergone very little change. Depression in the cotton trade continues to be exceed-ingly severe, and the situation, has been accentuated by extended holidays in many
Employment and Insurance Department-continued.districts, Unemployment and under-employment have reached great dimensions, and there is little, if any, prospect of improvement. At Darwen, for example, 35 mills have been entirely closed down. Arrangements for dealing with the workpeople at the mill premises have been made in connection with 15 mills; the remainder are dealt with at the Exchange, and it has been necessary to obtain additional premises. The Heywood Exchange report the most trying period in their history. The temporary emergency premises proved too small to accommodate the applicants, in spite of every effort to organise the flow of people. At Ashton, 2,000 claims for unemployment benefit were paid on the 31st December. At Bury, 1,780 fresh claims were taken, and the total number of claims is now 4,727, of whom 3,652 are short-time workers. At Farnworth the recipients of unemployment insurance benefit during the week numbered 7,454.Large numbers of short-time workers&apos; claims for unemployment insurance benefit are reported by the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division, where the staple industries show no improvement. Bradford report that 8,200 women, the majority textile workers, are claiming benefit, and larger numbers are expected. At Brighouse, 1,600 women are claiming benefit, the majority of the mills only working 24 hours a week; extended holidays of 8 to 10 days are general. At Morley firms have closed down for two or three weeks, and the live register is approximately 2,800. At Todmorden the cotton industry is on systematic short time, but the Aveavers avIio do colour work are fully employed.At Nottingham, the centre for lace, hosiery and making-up trades, there is no improve-ment, all firms either Avorking short time or closing down entirely.At Leeds the live register is noAv nearly 7,000, and 7,078 Avomen are claiming unemploy-ment insurance benefit, the majority being employed in the Avholesale clothing industry.The South Midlands and Eastern Division report little change as regards their staple industries, hosiery, Avholesale clothing, silk, boot and shoe manufacture, blouse-making and the food factories. The live registers in the division have increased by 1,970, the largest increases being shown at Norwich, Leicester and Reading. At Northampton, 2,760 short-time Avorkers, mainly boot operatives, are claiming unemployment insurance, in addition to 160 Avorkers totally unemployed. The boot industry remains depressed at Kettering and Wellingborough. At Kettering the trade has been advised by the employers&apos; federation to adopt systematic short time and many firms are expected to comply.Continued depression is reported in engineering, rubber Avork, Avholesale clothing and the leather trade from the West Midlands Division. At Aston the live register has been increased by a number of rubber workers discharged from local factories. At Sparkhill there is still depression in the motor and cycle trade. Many motor and engineering firms are still on short time at Coventry, and the number of current claims has increased by approximately 1,000. At Smethwick there is severe depression, especially amongst the metal machinists; 1,600 women are claiming unemployment insurance benefit.Reports from the pottery centres are not as good as they have been. At Burslem unemployment is said to be increasing in the industry, and at Longton, although there is not abnormal unemployment, it is said to be gradually groAving.There is no material change reported from the London and South-Eastern Division. The industrial centres continue to report acute industrial depression, and Exchanges in these areas have in many cases nearly 2,000, and in some cases over 2,000, women on the live register. The tin box trade, clothing trade, leather Avorks, and the jam preserve factories and the tobacco trade all remain severely depressed.The South-Western Division continue to report short time in the wholesale clothing industry. At Basingstoke there is little hope of reinstating the tailoresses on the register. Collar machinists are on short time at Bridgwater ; at Bristol slackness is reported in the cocoa and chocolate industry, in the chemical Avorks, in cigar works and in wholesale clothing and paper industries. The Eastville (Bristol) Exchange reports 1,700 claims current, most of the large firms, including corset and tobacco manufacturers, working short time. At Gloucester the live register is approximately 600, with 250 claims due to extended holidays.The Wales Division report depression in the tinplate centres at Gorseinon, Llanelly, Morriston, Neath and Port Talbot. At Pontypool it is stated that the work of the women&apos;s department is at a standstill, as all the available accommodation is taken up in dealing Avith the unemployment insurance claims by men and boys.The situation in. the Northern Division has not materially changed^ At Carlisle, 1,047 claims for benefit have been dealt Avith, the Avorkers hoping to resume in the second week of the neAV year. At Hebburn-on-Tyne the roperies are closing down oAving to accumulation of stock.   At Willington Quay firms have closed doAvn for 10 days.
Increased depression in the textile, hosiery, calico printing, flax, linen and j ate industries is reported from Scotland. Many firms are arranging extended holidays. Serious un-employment is reported from Glasgow; Barrhead report many textile operatives on the books, and all firms are on short time; at Bridgeton all trades are depressed ; at Clydebank the Singer Manufacturing Co., Ltd., have closed down for extended holidays, and 1,100 women are claiming in consequence.At Glasgow (South Side) the live register is 1,056, many tailoresses and mantle workers are on short time ; at Go van the live register shows a substantial increase, and there are, many skilled workers on the live register. At Dunfermline many linen operatives are being discharged, and 1,200 workers are affected by the short time worked in four mills. There are also 800 extended-holiday claims. The jute industry in Dundee is continuing to work short time. In the flax and calico printing industries at Johnstone, where holidays are extended until the 10th or 17th January, over 1,000 women are affected. At Kilmarnock many hosiery workers, woollen operatives and lace workers are affected by short time and extended holidays.LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Activities of Committees.Employment and Resettlement---Owing to the Christmas and the New Year holidays very few committees have held meetings during the period under review, but the various sub-committees and rotas have been actively engaged, especially in connection with the question of unemployment. The Leicester Committee, at the request of the local authorities, who have become somewhat alarmed at the congregation of unemployed claiming benefit, have had a special meeting to discuss the matter, and have recommended the hiring of additional premises and a relaxation of the Eules in regard to signing the unemployment register.Training. West Hartlepool report that they have been successful in placing a number of trainees in the building trade as improvers with local employers, and the employers have expressed satisfaction with the work performed by the men.OUT-OF-WORK DONATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFIT.Out-of-Work Donation. returns   by the Finance Department according to information received at the Claims and Record Office, Kew, for the week ending the 30th December, 1920, show 376,386 payments to policy holders, involving an amount of  351,140 18s. lOd.Unemployment Insurance. The number of payments of unemployment insurance benefit made during the week ending the 24th December, 1920, was 309,892, involving an amount of  153,336 1.7s. Qd.State of the Unemployment Fund. The balance standing to the credit of the Unem-ployment Fund on the 27th November was  22,053,966. During the period from the 31st October to the 27th November,  200,000 was transferred to the National Debt Com-missioners for investment, making the total sum transferred  22,075,000.Advances to WorJcpeople.-rSh.e number of advances made in October was 3,978, divided into 1,185 recoverable advances, and 2,793 non-recoverable advances. The total amount of recoverable advances was  1,094, compared with a total for September of  1,218.DISCHARGED AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.National Scheme. Up to and including the 5th January, 23,588 certificates have been issued to employers. The undertakings given by these employers cover 260,307 disabled ex-Service men.The manager of the Southampton Exchange reports that every disabled men on the live register has been placed in employment.During the past month an active campaign on behalf of disabled men has been proceeding throughout the North-Western Division. Appeals have been made in the Press and by local authorities, canvassing reports have been reviewed, and all firms who previously gave unsatisfactory replies are being visited. The extreme slackness in trade, together with the pressure of work, have militated against the success of the campaign, although some success was achieved in certain localities. At Liverpool the Lord Mayor convened a special meeting of prominent business men, at which it was resolved to make
APPOINTMENTS AND TRAINING.APPOINTMENTS  AND  CIVIL LIABILITIES  DEPARTMENT.APPOINTMENTS.Statistics. During the week ending the 31st December the Appointments Depart-ment placed 295 candidates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 47,728. Of these, 6,459 have been placed through the agency of the departments interviewing Boards. Applications were registered from 525 ex-Service men and 8 civilians. The number of candidates available for appoint-ments on the 31st December was 10,507 ex-Service men and 1,387 civilians. At the same date 1,128 &quot;live&quot; vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 311 having been registered during the week.BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.Maintenance and Training Grants Scheme.- During the week ending the 31st December the Appointments Department received applications for training under this scheme from 23 officers and men of similar educational qualifications, of which 11 were for training of the type provided by the department. Deducting cancellations and withdrawals, 28,235 applications for training of this latter type have been received in all, and 49,897 for training of the type provided by other Government departments. The Interviewing Boards have dealt with 27,632 applications, of which 23,168 have been recommended. The Grants Committee, dealing with applications so recommended, have received 22,069 applications and sanctioned grants in 18,221 cases.Business Training Scheme. During the week ending the 31st December&apos; the Appoint-ments Department received 76 applications for training under this scheme, bringing the total number of applications to 1,458, of which 245 have since been cancelled. Grants have been sanctioned in 202 cases. At the same date, 279 training vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 39 having been registered during the week.Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant. The Appointments Depart-ment have dealt with a total of 973 cases, in 457 of which the training sanctioned is provided by the Appointments Department, and in the remainder by other Government departments. Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed training in 250 cases, and abandoned training in 45 ; 143 are still in training, and 19 are awaiting training.TRAINING DEPARTMENT. INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men.Statistics. On the 4th January, 24,964 men were in training, as against 24,932 on the 28th December and 25,044 on the 7th December. The number of men placed in training during the week was 326. There were 16,248 men awaiting training, the corre-sponding totals for the 28th December and the 7th December being 16,304 and 16,264,Employment and Insurance Department-continued.a special and urgent appeal to all employers in Liverpool on behalf of disabled men. The Lord Mayor addressed a personal letter to the larger firms in the City, and this letter was published in all local papers, together with leading articles commenting on it. Since the issue of the appeal, articles emphasising the claims of the disabled man, together with statistical tables, and a copy of the local Roll of Honour, have appeared daily in the leading newspapers of the city. The result up to the present is extremely gratifying&apos;; 60 vacancies have been notified and 34 men have been placed in employment.[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment and Insurance Department will also he found on pages 42 to 47. 64 and 65.]
respectively. The number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 23,292, the totals for the 28th December and the 7th December being 22,998 and 21,916, respectively.During the greater part of 1920 the Industrial Training Scheme may be said to have developed satisfactorily, and as rapidly as could be expected, when due regard is paid to the difficulties encountered in connection with the constructional work and equipment required to meet the shortage of training facilities which was the chief obstacle to progress in the earlier stages.On the 1st January, 1920, there were between 16,000 and 17,000 men in training, and, during the first six months in the year, numbers rose rapidly. By the end of June the total exceeded 24,000, an increase of approximately 50 per cent. Since that date, partly owing to a marked increase in the rate of termination of training, and partly, in the later months of the year, to trade depression, there has been no marked growth in the figure, though it has passed the 25,000 mark on several occasions.Nearly all the divisions started the year with long waiting lists which, for the first three months at any rate, tended rather to expand than to diminish. This was largely due to the shortage of training facilities, and also to the fact that local staffs had but little time or opportunity for the necessary classification and interviewing. From April onwards, however, this side of the problem has been handled effectively, and the waiting list, which, at the beginning of the year, contained nearly 30,000 names, has now been reduced to about 16,000. The constantly growing Irish list now accounts for over 20 per cent, of this total.Owing to the growth of unemployment, there has been during the winter months a marked increase in the number of applications. At least 25 per cent, of the present total are men who have been definitely approved, and are ready to step into the first vacancies that may arise, while the majority of the remainder are new applicants, passing through the preliminary stages of inquiry and interview. The most recent reports indicate that the interval between definite acceptance for, and admission to, a specific training course is now in most instances comparatively short.A weekly average of placings in training of 500 in January rose, in three months, by about 20 per cent, and, except for the holiday period in July and August, was maintained at this level till October, when a marked decline began to take place until, at the end of December, the weekly average had fallen to about 400.In January last the most serious difficulty which confronted Divisional Directors was the inadequacy of existing training facilities and the paucity of institutions capable of carrying out varied courses of training on any really considerable scale. When all the present factory schemes are complete, constructional alterations carried out, and equip-ment provided, there should be training places for a total of some 20,000 men. If con-ditions were more favourable and admissions to some of the more important special trades less closely restricted, the number of men in training in Government Instructional Factories might be even higher than it is, as there are still a number of places which could be occupied immediately.Towards the end of the year, owing mainly to trade depression, the department found themselves confronted by a new problem that of finding improvership vacancies in employers&apos; workshops for men who had successfully completed their institutional courses. This difficulty is likely to continue until some form of trade revival takes place, but, as a result of intensive effort, at the end of the year a fair number of workshop placings were still being arranged, and advantage was taken, where necessary, of the sanction given to retain men in the factories beyond the period laid down in the schemes.Exhibitions. At the Ex-Service Men&apos;s Winter Carnival working exhibits in basket-making, picture-frame making and sign-writing are being shown. The exhibits are attracting considerable attention, and the baskets especially are finding a very ready sale. H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, on the occasion of his visit on the 6th January, showed particular interest in the display made by the Training Department.Good progress is being made with the organisation of the exhibition of training work to be given in connection with the Daily Mail Efficiency Exhibition at Olympia, where the whole of the space in the annexe has been put at the disposal of the department. A complete list of exhibits has been prepared, and the stands and decorations are being made at the London woodworking centres.Government Instructional Factories.- During the last two months of the year the number of men in training in Government Instructional Factories rose by 1,620, and at the end of the year the total was approximately 9,100.   London and Middlesex have the
largest numbers of men in training under factory conditions, the figures being upwards of 1,300 and 1,050, respectively.Women&apos;s Training.Training of Registered Unemployed Women. Renewed activity in connection with the training of registered unemployed women has resulted from the widespread increase of unemployment. Difficulties in arranging training arise, however, from the imprac-practicability of providing any form of industrial training in view of the numbers of skilled women already out of employment, and from the reluctance of applicants for training to enter domestic occupations, especially as it has not been found possible, for financial reasons, to sanction classes for less than 15 trainees. In Cambridge, however, the necessary number was forthcoming, and sanction has been given for a general domestic course which will be attended by from 18 to 20 trainees. In London it has become necessary to extend the courses in waiting and cookery at the Westminster Technical Institute, fresh classes starting on the 12th January.   Other schemes are under consideration.Training of War Widows. Very satisfactory progress has been made during the past five weeks in reducing the number of outstanding applications from war widows, 467 cases having been disposed of. The panel have sanctioned training in 267 cases. Fresh appli-cations continue to be made, in spite of the wide publicity given to the fact that the closing date was the 15th October. During December, 72 applications were received. It has been decided, after very careful consideration, that the original decision to accept no application made after the 15th October should be adhered to as a general rule, unless the applicant can prove that inquiries on the subject were made, before that date, of certain recognised bodies or Government departments. Exception is also made in cases where application is made within one year of the husband&apos;s death. Publicity has been given in the Press and in all Post Offices to these conditions as to future applications.Arrangements are well advanced for opening, in early January, training centres at Bloomsbury, Hammersmith, Hornsey and Newcastle-on-Tyne. It is hoped that these classes will give training to approximately 145 widows. A considerable number of widows will also be placed in training during the forthcoming term at various institutes and polytechnics.An analysis has been made of the figures relating to cases of midwifery training. It was found that 147 women had completed their training, and that, of these, 105 had succeeded in passing the qualifying examination of the Central Midwives Board. Twenty-four were unsuccessful, 15 of whom will sit again for the examination. In 18 cases the result has not yet been notified.  Training vacancies are at present difficult to obtain.Training of Disabled Nurses. Eleven fresh applications have been received during the month, and sanction for training has been given in four cases. One of these had presented some difficulty owing to the fact that, apart from being in poor health generally, the nurse was nearly blind through war service. Her choice of occupation was therefore very limited, but a satisfactory solution was found by arranging for training in Braille at the Royal Blind Asylum and School in Edinburgh. It is expected that she will be given employment in connection with the school after training.Two nurses have satisfactorily completed training as institutional housekeepers and have secured good posts in hospitals. Another nurse has obtained her certificate as a health visitor after a year&apos;s study at King&apos;s College for Women, London.Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.Statistics. Up to the 5th January agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 45,188 apprentices under the 41 schemes approved. Grants had been sanc-tioned in respect of 43,204 apprentices, employed by 17,243 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 16,104.Applications. Further progress is reported in dealing with unmated apprentices in the Northern area, though the depression of trade has considerably increased the difficulty. A fourth firm have now agreed to accept 10 engineering apprentices to enable them to receive institutional training ; and a fifth firm are taking four for training in their work-shops, in addition to nine accepted for institutional training. Local headquarters hope to provide elsewhere for a number of others.
The value of this method depends largely upon the facilities available for institutional training. In the Northern area, where so much use has been made of the method, no great difficulty seems so far to have been experienced. The position, however, is not always so favourable, and the offers of employers cannot always be utilised.Acceptance or Non-Acceptance. In contrast with that of many firms in the electrical and plumbing trades at Glasgow, the attitude of Messrs. A. Anderson &amp; Co. has throughout been most favourable. The training, whether of plumbers, electricians or brass finishers, is among the best in Glasgow, and the work is very varied, so that on completing his time an apprentice can confidently enter any shop or yard on the Clyde as a competent journey-man.Progress of Training. The Wages and Conditions Committee of the National Joint Industrial Council for the Pottery Industry have discussed the reports of firms in regard to the training of apprentices under the scheme. All those affected have not yet reported, but the information available indicates that training is generally satisfactory. The position appears to show marked improvement, compared with that prevailing some months ago. After discussion, the committee expressed their appreciation of the evidence that the scheme is receiving adequate attention from employers and operatives.Termination of Agreements. Difficulty has arisen in the furniture industry at Aberdeen from the refusal of two firms to recognise a national wages agreement applicable to appren-tices, who struck in consequence. The firm&apos;s ex-Service apprentices came out in sympathy with them. The other employers in the industry are doing everything possible to induce these firms to observe the agreement. In view of the difficult position in which the ex-Service apprentices are now placed, the trade union secretary is attempting to secure their transfer to other employers.In the course of reductions of staff, caused by slackness of work, Messrs. Hill&apos;s Dry Docks and Engineering Co., Ltd., Cardiff, gave 48 hours notice to an apprentice under the engineering scheme. After representations by local headquarters, however, the notice has been withdrawn ; but much dissatisfaction is being caused among the journeymen by the proposal to retain the apprentice at nearly the journeyman&apos;s rates, while fitters of 10 years&apos; continuous employment are required to stand off. The apprentice, however, wishes to go to sea as soon as possible, as a marine engineer, and if the firm succeed in their efforts to find him a berth, the agreement will probably be terminated by mutual consent.Institutional Training. Suspensions and short time are leading, in the South Midlands and Eastern area, to increasing demands for institutional training. These are mostly in engineering, and one Leicester firm alone has applied for such training for 12 apprentices. Local headquarters hope that all these applicants will shortly be provided for, but the available classes in engineering are already very full.Preparations are well advanced for a class at the Paisley Technical College for the benefit of apprentices who are being suspended for one week in every two. As many as 40 are eligible for a full course among those employed by two firms. Other apprentices similarly affected have too short a period to serve under the scheme to benefit from training in alternate weeks. Arrangements, however, are under consideration to provide a con-tinuous course for them at the Royal Technical College, Glasgow.General Training.Apprenticeship (Building). In Scotland the sub-committee of the Regional Education Committee of the Joint Industrial Council, who are considering the detailed application of the national scheme, have completed their analysis of the scheme, and are now to report to the full committee. At a meeting on the 14th December, the Northern Counties Building Trades Employers&apos; Federation unanimously adopted the scheme, and requested their local branches to put it into operation as soon as possible. The attitude of the meeting was favourable. The operatives in this area are also reported to be very favour-able. There are^good prospects that a joint conference will soon be held. Good progress is also reported in the Yorkshire and East Midlands area, where joint conferences have been arranged in a number of districts, including Leeds, Bradford, Nottingham, Hull and Don-caster. The progress&apos; in the last two areas is especially satisfactory, as previously there had been considerable opposition from the employers. Good progress is likewise reported in Wales. In the West Midlands the district organiser of the operatives has promised his co-operation.  This is likely to expedite consideration of the scheme by the operatives,
which is not so forward as in the case of the employers. At Birmingham the operatives&apos; committee have already adopted the scheme in principle, and are placing it before their members for consideration. A conference of the. industry at Walsall has decided to accept the scheme, and to hold a further meeting to put it into operation early in the year. At Wolverhampton there has been some opposition from employers, who seem to resent the Councils intervention in the matter, but there are hopes that this will be overcome.Apprenticeship : Farriery. In Wales, master farriers are reported to be strongly of opinion that the time is ripe for definite action by the State to assist the industry in estab-lishing definite schemes of training. Their South Wales district secretary urges that the trade deserves a higher status, but that, without outside help, matters are likely to drift until there is a dangerous shortage of skilled smiths and farriers. Attention is drawn to the after-effects of former exploitation of boy labour.In the Southern counties of England the prevailing wage rates have an important influence on the supply of apprentices. Reference may be made to a Whitstable farrier, who is paying an apprentice double the rates specified in his indenture, but, even so, will only pay him 16s. per week in his last year. A Hastings employer states that the trade is being recruited to a great extent from men who start as smiths&apos; strikers in engineering. He considers that horse-shoeing by itself can be learnt in 18 months. From Lancashire comes the suggestion that the difficulty caused by shortage of apprentices can be overcome by training adult labourers. At Darlington this shortage is said to be acute. On the other hand, Gateshead employers, whose shops are often small and antiquated, do not wish to be bothered with apprentices, and have apparently little difficulty in securing skilled men. A Maidstone employer also considers that sufficient boys are entering the trade. He advocates the use of indentures, however, to prevent them leaving it for higher wages elsewhere during their apprenticeship.Technical Training. The chairman of the Bury St. Edmunds Master Builders&apos; Association is a strong advocate of technical training in this industry during the winter months. He has induced the local education authority to establish classes and is acting as instructor. He started with 8 students and the number has now increased to 15. His method is to explain the origin, manufacture and constituents of various materials. He has asked for the use of a wall to teach paperhanging, and believes that, with a room and a supply of bricks and mortar, he can successfully teach bricklaying.
