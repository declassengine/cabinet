A decision of the Cabinet is required on this important issue.W. S. C.The &quot;War Office,3rd January, 1921.Secretary of State.May I ask you to bring the attached three telegrams (1a, 1b and lc) to the notice of the Cabinet at the earliest possible moment, since, should they decide to proceed with the immediate evacuation of Persia, it is essential that a decision to that effect should reach General Haldane by the 7th January. G-eneral Haldane&apos;s telegram gives what appears to me to be a very fair statement of the advantages and disadvantages of imme-diate evacuation of Persia from the purely military point of view. The advantages are that we shall be able to commence the evacuation of Mesopotamia before this hot weather sets in, and thereby complete the withdrawal to the Basra Vilayet by July, 1921, instead of March, 1922. The disadvantages, on the other hand, are that some hardship will inevitably be inflicted on the civilians and also on the troops in Persia, and that abnormal weather may interrupt and jeopardize the movement. On the other hand, the same weather would absolutely prevent any offensive action by the Bolsheviks. The General Officer Commanding-in-Chief s telegram does not deal with the civil aspect of the question either as regards Persia or Mesopotamia, but this no doubt will be taken into consideration by the Cabinet when coming to a decision.As regards Persia, it would seem that no amount of delay which could be accepted by the Cabinet would be sufficient to enable the local Government to complete the formation of a Persian Force capable of replacing British troops in useful time. &apos;With regard to Mesopotamia, however, Sir Percy Cox will no doubt represent that more deliberate methods of evacuation might enable him to fill the vacuum, and should this point of view carry the day, there would be no object in incurring the hardships and risks which would appear to be inseparable from the evacuation of Persia during the winter.Henry Wilson,C.I.G.S.3rd January, i921.la.From War Office to General Officer Commanding-in-Chief] Mesopotamia.(No. 87319, cipher.   D.M.O.) 23rd December, 1920.To be deciphered by a Staff officer. -1. We had been urging for a long time previously the importance of withdrawing from Persia before the winter came on, in order that questions of general policy in Mesopotamia might not be fettered by difficulties of withdrawing from Persia during the winter, but for questions of high policy the(B21/48)   100   1/21   n&amp;S/Ltd  8853wo
Cabinet decided to remain there till the spring. They have, however, now decided that the question of withdrawing the force from Persia at an earlier date than 1st April mentioned by Ironside must be fully examined.The evacuation of white refugees from Teheran and elsewhere in advance of the troops is, of course, essential, but it is not necessary that all stores should be removed, though anything having the appearance of a panic withdrawal is to be avoided.We shall be glad if you will consult Ironside and give us your considered opinion as to whether earlier withdrawal is a practical possibility, and of the consequences and dangers which would be entailed thereby.Part 2. 2. The Cabinet are anxious to reduce expenditure in Mesopotamia by withdrawal at the earliest possible moment to a position covering Basra. So far as we can judge, the date of withdrawal from Persia is the limiting factor, though it is for consideration whether time might not be gained by a preliminary withdrawal in the Mosul Vilayet, before or simultaneously with the withdrawal from Persia, to a position covering railheads. In forwarding an approximate time-table for complete withdrawal to the Basra position, you will no doubt take this into consideration. It is understood that the Cabinet regard the necessity for the early reduction of expenditure by the withdrawal of military forces as entirely over-ruling any considerations for the internal security of the country after our troops have left, and taking this for the moment as your basis of calculation, the time required for organizing local forces in the evacuated area need not be taken into consideration by you.Part 3. 3. We have tentatively suggested the holding of a position, including Ahwaz Kurna Nasiriyeh, with a garrison estimated at 1 division, 2 cavalry regiments and 2 battalions. You will no doubt give us your views in due course, stating the general line you would propose to hold, the troops required, including an estimate of Air Forces required.We are asking the India Office to send communication on the subject of this telegram to.the High Commissioner.lb.From General Headquarters, Mesopotamia, to War Office.(No. X 1006, cipher.) 31st December 1920.Your No. 87319, D.M.O,, 23rd December. Part 1.-1. Climatic conditions are the chief factors affecting the practicability of early withdrawal.(a.) In Persia normally the passes are not continuously open till the end of March.(b.) In Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf hot weather prevails after May. Movements must be carried out within the period between April and May to avoid risk from weather, but Indian units can be (?) moved in June and July. After making enquiries as to the possibility of commencing the move before the Persian passes are continuously open, I have reached the conclusion that it will be possible to withdraw from Persia all impedimenta, non-fighting personnel and refugees before March, provided that the weather conditions are good, leaving a purely fighting column to withdraw as weather conditions allow during March.Part 2. It must be recognized, however, that, should bad weather come on, this entails risk of (?) unavoidable hardship and loss of life. Against this risk may be set the advantage that there will be less danger in our withdrawal from Mesopotamia during the spring owing to following three factors :-[a) Danger of serious external aggression unlikely so soon ; (b) tribes are agriculturally busy then, whereas the summer is their chief fighting season, and (c) the recent suppression of the insurrection in the Baghdad Vilayet and on the Euphrates maybe expected to prevent in these areas another serious rising so soon.Part 3. 2. Assuming that withdrawal from Persia is carried out successfully as above, the withdrawal of the (?) outposts and garrisons in the Mosul Villayet would be carried out during March and April, all impedimenta and non-fighting personnel having been removed first.3. On above basis the end of July should see withdrawal to Basra Villayet completed.
4. The proposals above made are affected by the following factors: (a.) The removal of white refugees, Teheran, will (?) present difficulties, and their evacuation during the months of January and February will bring a strain upon my transport resources. These refugees would also suffer hardships in travelling at this time of year. Every possible arrangement for. their comfort and protection from sickness would, of course, be made.(6.) Up to the present the winter this year has been (?) abnormally severe.Part 4. (c.) To move formed body of troops until the passes are definitely open would involve serious risk of casualties from weather and only small parties can be moved with reasonable safety. )(d.) Approximately 15,000 Assyrian refugees in the Mosul Villayet cannot be left without (?) practical certainty of extermination, and, therefore, must be withdrawn before we move our troops. This will throw a heavy strain on transport, concurrently with the demand for (?) Persian refugees.(e.) It is likely that certain installations and machinery may have to be abandoned.(/.) The weather conditions. Movements would be seriously delayed by a severe and late winter in Persia. In Mesopotamia a rainy spring will similarly delay movement in this country.Part 5. 5. To sum up, provided abnormal weather conditions do not prevail, the operation is possible, but hardships and casualties must be accepted. The whole operation will be jeopardised and a serious situation may result if abnormal weather conditions are met.6. Whether the risks entailed are to be accepted and the movement undertaken is a question for His Majesty&apos;s Government to decide, but I shall not be able to carry it out unless I receive definite orders by the 7th January.1c.From General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Mesopotamia, to War Office.(No. No. X 1103, cipher.) 2nd January, 1921.Continuation No. X 1006, 31st December. Part 1. 1. Additional considerations are as follows : (a.) As regards White refugees from Teheran and elsewhere, although informed of arrangements and warned that evacuation must be completed by specified date, it cannot be guaranteed that civilians will comnly with the arrangements made. It will be explained to them that those who do not comply, or decide to leave only at the last moment, are not to expect any assistance and must remain at their own peril, A selected staff officer from General Headquarters, working under the orders of General Officer Commanding, Norperforce, will be entrusted with task of evacuation of refugees.(6.) The programme in my No. X 1006 is based on the assumption that during the period of evacuation peace conditions will prevail. I am hopeful that this will be the case, but it can not be guaranteed.Part 2. (c.) (?) Complete evacuation of Persia, Mosul, Baghdad, &amp;c. Without handing over to any substitute force to maintain order, there will certainly be, at the last moment, a panic evacuation of these classes of the local population, possibly on a large scale, and my movements will be impeded accordingly. Even though warning be issued to the population that they will receive no assistance in such case, it will not be possible to allow them to be starved or to be cut up by marauders.(d.) Should bad weather be encountered during the withdrawal from Persia, the dangers to be incurred are those inherent in any movement in high altitudes in winter from exposure, including loss of life. Delay in carrying out the (?) complete programme will also ensue, thereby bringing its completion into the hot weather.2. It is not my wish that the difficulties of the operation proposed be minimized or exaggerated, but only that all factors be fairly presented in order that a decision may be facilitated.s
