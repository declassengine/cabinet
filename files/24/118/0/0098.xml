529The-exceptionally generous term* grsnt^d to service mon and their dependents during tho Great War oannot &quot;bo continued indefinitely.   Tho rate.: of pone:ion -ire higher than Is necessary for a professional Array, the members of which have frequently e oon:-:idoratio service ponoion to add to any award made to thorn for disability,, rnd there ere special features about the war socles ouch a^ the &quot;alternative pension&quot; whuch are quite unuditod to present conditions. Tho settlement of fee tod by tho rJar Po no ions Aot 1920 was that tho responsibility for dealing with claims arising out of casualtiss which oocur moro than 30 days after tho termination of the War should be transferred from the Ministry of pensions to the-Service Departments. ,     As stated by the War Office, o reduced scale rocommendod by Mr. Baldwin&apos;s Committee will be applied to such oases.Tho difficulty to which tho War Office ,call attention must inevitably have arisen and there is no particular advantage in postponing the day when it will have to be, faced. If the new scales are not to be applied &quot;in Ireland and other areas where hostilities may be in progress at the official end of the War&quot; their, introduction may be jeopardised. It will obviously not be a simple matter to say at. what date hostilities in a particular area cease..If it is considered&apos; that public Tooling would bo strongly sot against a reduction at the present time in the particular case of service in Ireland, it is suggested that it would be sufficient for the Cabinet to riilo that tho higher rates of pension Should continue to apply to Ireland for a period oftsay six months after the War Pensions Act 1920 becomes opera-tive, the matter then to bo recohsiderod. :In thosemcircumstances/
circumstance3 the Treasury would, under the Dispensing Warrant, authorise the grant.of flat rate pensions at thehigher rates laid down in the.. War warrants, but they wouldnot regard it as necessary to continue &quot;alternativepensions&quot;9(Intd.) S*B, 4th January, 1921*
