W.F.M.L. 3.MINISTRY OF FOOD.DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON WHOLESALE FOOD MARKETS,THIRD REPORT.LONDON FISH SUPPLIES AND DISTRIBUTION.To the Food Controller,We have pleasure in presenting oar Third Report which deals with the question of London Fish Supplies and Distribution.1. We have examined witnesses representing the Corporation of the City of London, the principal Associations of Wholesale and Retail Dealers in Fish, representatives of the Railway Executive Committee, representatives of: cartage contractors, coster-mongers, fish fryers and fish porters, as well as representatives of the National Fish Trades&apos; Association, the British Trawler Owners&apos; Federation, the National Union of British Fishermen and the principal company engaged in the transport of fish to Billingsgate by water.2. After caieful consideration of the evidence, we are agreed that a Central Wholesale Fish Market is desirable for the present and future needs of London.3.   The question then arises as to(i) Whether the existing market at Billingsgate is adequate for this purpose.(ii) Whether it can be made adequate.(iii) Whether it is desirable that a Central Market should be situated elsewhere.Market Buildings.4. On the first point, we are of opinion that the present market facilitates provided by Billingsgate are altogether inadequate. The area of the market building itself in relation to the tonnage of fish at present handled compares very unfavourably with that of the principal provincial Wholesale FisH Markets (see Appendix I). There are no cartways by means of which road borne fish can be unloaded directly on to the stands. The stands themselves are very limited in area. The gangways giving access to them are, during the business hours of the market, highly congested, and the general condition is such that the whole of the fish actually dealt with, in the market building itself has to be handled in separate packages by the market porters, even the use of trucks or trolleys being impossible inside the market. Access, to the market from the road is obtainable on.one front only, and this fact alone is responsible for a. good deal of the congestion of traffic caused in the streets adjacent to the market.5. Empty packages are at present stored in the basement, and although there is a lift it does not appear to be used &quot;to any great extent, the bulk of the empties being carried by hand up or down the stairway leading to the basement, and .thus adding to the congestion at the entrance of the market.6. There is no suitable storage accommodation for the preservation of fish left unsold at the end of a day&apos;s market, a proportion of which has consequently to be sent back to a railway station, or in some cases to a carriers depot and brought to the market again on the following day, thus entailing additional labour and transport, which, apart from other considerations, ought not to be wasted in this manner. We are not satisfied that fish so returned is invariably protected in such a manner as to ensure its preservation. Evidence was given that, in the case of the carriers, the vans containing fish simply stood in the carrier&apos;s yard in close proximity to the stables until they were required&apos; again, but, even apart from this, it is obvious that a considerable waste and deterioration has hitherto occurred from this cause.We have been informed that a scheme for the provision of such storage and of an ice plant is being carried out which, when completed, will afford a measure of relief in this respect.Accommodation was provided on an upper floor for a haddock market, but it did not receive the support of the market salesmen, and is now used for offices.7. Supplies of fish brought to the market by water are at present considerably below the supplies provided in this manner before the war, and in fact do not yet amount to much more than about a quarter of the pre-war tonnage, or about 9 per cent, of the present tonnage of-fish from all sources. (See Appendix II.) The river front of the market affords sufficient snace for the accommodation of the boats bringing the present supplies. Before the war, when the supplies of water-borne fish amounted to 35 per cent. 40 per cent, of the whole, there was need for additional berthing accommodation, as the carriers had frequently to berth alongside each other, the cargoes of the outer boats being discharged over the decks of those lying nextOI285) Wt. 27593-3512 6, 59 12/20 H.S1 G. 36 4. 2
the pontoon. Occasionally boats had to stand off and wait until others had been dis-charged. It should, therefore, be noted that the present wharfage space is insufficient to deal efficiently and economically with any substantial increase over the present supply of water-borne fish.Landings are made by porters working over gangways, no mechanical appliances of any land being in use. The fish so landed is brought into the market building, and there sold by auction1 under congested conditions, as no sufficient area, is set aside for the disposal of fish in this manner. The&quot; fish so disposed of has again to be carried by hand, either to the merchants&apos; stands in the market, where it is resold to retailers, or through the market to the purchasers&apos; vans standing outside. The general congestion, within the building is such as must add greatly to the difficulties of carrying on business economically by anybody concerned.The tonnage of fish handled at Billingsgate, which before the war averaged from 500 to 600 tons per diem, has of late averaged well over 800 tons.8. The inadequacy of the market building is further emphasised by the existence of upwards of 40 wholesale fish shops in the immediate neighbourhood, handling, it is stated, approximately one-third of the railway-borne fish consigned to Billingsgate. The advantage in the maintenance of a, wholesale fish market is denied at Billingsgate to the proportion of the supplies handled in these merchants&apos; premises.Traffic Congestion.9, The approaches to Billingsgate Market are altogether unequal to the rapid clearance of the necessary traffic by road entailed by the volume of business transacted. The quantity of rail-borne fish brought into the market area now averages 750 tons per diem, and this quantity, in addition to the sea-borne fish, has to be redistributed by road by means of the purchasers&apos; vans and other vehicles.The result is that traffic during the period when the market is at work congests Upper and Lower Thames Streets as far east as Great Tower Hill and to the west as far as the foot of Garlick Hill. The congestion extends on the north to Eastcheap, and sometimes beyond, and Great Tower Street, and in Gracechurch Street almost as far as Eenchurch Street.10. The difficulties of the Billingsgate site are well illustrated by the extraordinary arrange-ment made between the trade and the railway companies, under which, instead of goods being actually delivered to the consignee at the address of the latter, as is the universal practice else-where, it has been arranged that delivery may be accepted within an agreed area, comprising Lower Thames Street from Fish Street Hill to Harp Lane and the whole of Monument Street, with the parts of Pudding Lane and Botolph Lane south of Monument Street.This agreed area is completely filled by railway and other vans as a rule soon after 6 a.m., from which time the overflow into surronding streets begins to accumulate. (See Appendix HI.) The area is not entirely cleared of standing fish traffic until a much later hour in the day.11. Another practice which, so far as we are aware, is peculiar to Billingsgate, is that of selling a considerable quantity of the fish delivered by van, by sample or even only by mark. If. the vans were cleared promptly, some saving in handling would be effected under this arrange-ment, but, as a general rule, the vans are not completely unloaded until the buyers are able to take delivery of their purchases, and as a result the vans are detained unnecessarily, often for a considerable time, and are in effect used by the consignees as temporary warehouses. If the market accommodation were such as to permit the vans *o be unloaded on arrival, a very con-siderable economy could be effected which ought in the end to be to the advantage of the consumer.Evidence given to us shows that delays, due largely to this cause, average. 3\ hours per van, and in exceptional cases have reached as much as 9 hours. We have been informed that in the case of the principal provincial markets the time taken to clear vans averages half an hour, and the only apparent reason why delivery should not be accepted at Billingsgate approximately to the same figure must be found in the inadequacy of the market building itself, coupled with the fact that deliveries can only be made on one of its fronts.In a recent case in the Railway and Canal Commission Court a decision was arrived at that the proper time to allow for entire consignments was two hours, and in the case of consignments properly called mixed consignments 2J hours (Great Northern Railway versus Leleu, and Stanley Pibel, Ltd., versus Great Northern Railway). The average maximum free period, which is rarely exceeded, in the leading provincial wholesale markets, is under three-quarters of an hour, and this comparison in itself affords a strong condemnation of the conditions under which the Billingsgate Market is at present worked.The representative of the Railway Executive Committee has stated that the number of van&apos; loads of fish delivered at Billingsgate during the year ending 30th November, 1919, was approxi-mately 80,000. If the.average detention of the vans had been f hour instead of 3  hours, the&apos; saving in cost would have been at the rate of  50,000 per annum, reckoning the cost of detention at 5s. per hour ner van. This saving, by reducing the cost of distribution of fish in London, would undoubtedly benefit the consumer.Tt lias also been given in evidence that the handling of the traffic in the immediate neich-bourhood of the market building is complicated by the traffic belonging&apos; to other wharves, ware-houses and business premises in that area, an important factor in which is the fruit traffic from Nicholsons Wharf and Fresh Wharf, at which very large quantities of imported fruit and vegetables are dealt with. t12. A further complication is introduced by the delay, unavoidable in present circumstances, in the collection of empties from the retailers who return them when they arrive at the market, and the clearance of them by the railway vans later in the day.
The representative of the Railway Executive stated that it was the practice of the railway Companies to retain a proportion of their vans for the latter purpose.Under an experimental arrangement empties are not being picked up before 10 o&apos;clock, and to a certain extent carrier&apos;s vans have to be sent down to the market later in the day when the congestion is over to load up with empties. The empties are brought up by hand from the basement and carried out into the street to the vans.13. The representatives of the Billingsgate merchants complain of the delays ori the part of the railway companies in unloading fish at the stations of arrival and forwarding it to the Billingsgate Market area. The question of the facilities provided at the railway stations for the despatch of fish on arrival is dealt with below, bat on the point of the adequacy of the Billings-gate Market it should be noted here that witnesses were agreed that if it were possible to deliver all rail-borne fish at the time of the opening of the market it would not be possible for the trade to handle such quantities as are now coming in, and tho vans could not in fact be cleared and the fish disposed of in much less time than is at present occupied. The whole of the vans could not get into the agreed area, within which there could be no accommodation for the vans of the buyers.The maximum capacity of the agreed area is stated by the Market Superintendent to bo 210 two-horse vans, but in practice it is found impossible to accommodate so many, the actual number of delivery vans in the area rarely exceeding 170-180. With an average load of three tons per van, this means that not more than 540 tons of fish can at any one time be placed on the agreed area for delivery. On many occasions recently the supplies of rail-borne fish have exceeded 900 tons and the average quantity so delivered daily during the first nine months of this year waa about 750 tons.A further point must be made in connection with modern development of road-borne traffic. Witnesses are agreed and the railway companies lay great stress on the fact that in the narrow streets surrounding Billingsgate it would be practically impossible to use motor lorries, and that even if motors could be brought into the area the cost of having these expensive vehicles out of action for a. considerable portion of the day would be prohibitive.14. The bulk of the rail-borne fish brought into the market and all deliveries from the market or market area are made by porters who are paid a rate per package varying with the distance to which it has to be carried. These porterage charges are paid by the buyer. The effect of the congestion and the extent of the area affected by it is a considerable increase in the cost of fish, which is, of course, reflected in the price charged to the consumer. Very few trucks are used for the purpose of conveying fish, and those only outside the market. The number of porters at present licensed is about 1,200, and the average weekly wage was estimated by the market superintendent at  5. The Billingsgate Fish Workers&apos; Protection Society includes about 900 members, not all of whom are licensed, and the charges for rail-borne fish vary from 3d. to Is. per package. The practice of sub-contncting exists, under which licensed porters instead of carrying the package themselves hire outside porters to carry it at a lower rate.It was also given in evidence that foremen porters will keep work for their own men even at the risk of delay to the purchaser, in order to secure a share of the porterage. It was stated by the market superintendent that in cases where the fish is net brought into the market the porters make the same charge for carrying in the ticket that they would have made for carrying in the package. The Secretary of the Society stated that in such cases it is the salesman who profits, the cost of porterage on fish sent to the market to be sold on commission being charged to the sender whether such fish is actually brought into the market or only sold from the railway van.We are informed that tile retail buyer is not allowed to collect his goods from the stand of the seller and put them on his own van.15. We are of opinion that the ancient system of porterage is one which is not satisfactory in the light of modern labour conditions, and that it should be carefully reviewed in such a manner as to secure an efficient and properly regulated service satisfactory both to the men and to all branches of the trade, which would provide for standardised rates of payment, if possible on the basis of a weekly wage. The waste of labour involved in the present porterage system may be perhaps indicated by the fact that 1,200 licensed porters, in addition to an uncertain, quantity of casual labour, are employed for the purpose of handling an average of about 800 tons of fish per diem.Railway Transport.16. The question of the transport of fish by rail has been referred to in the Cornmittee&apos;s second report in relation to the waste of fish. The problem is one of great importance and we have given much time and thought to its consideration. The extreme perishability of fish makes it imperative that every care should be exercised in conveying it from the port of landing to the centres of distribution, in such a way as to ensure that it is as fresh as possible when it reaches the consumer. Regular and speedy fish trains, composed of covered wagons of a suitable type should be booked to run at such&apos;times as will permit of the fish arriving atl its destination sufficiently early in the morning to admit of the whole train load reaching the market in good time.We regret to find that the present conditions fall far short of this ideal. Evidence from fish merchants shows that open wagons suitable only for the conveyance of merchandise are regularly used for fish traffic, and that in some instances a fish train has included wagons-which have previously been used for conveying coal and manure. Members of the Committee who visited Hull to examine the conditions there found that the fish train was largely composed of31285 A 3
open wagons, while closed wagons labelled &quot;For Fish Traffic Only &quot; were being utilised foi&apos; tiie transport of imported fruit and vegetables. At Grimsby some open wagons were being used for the conveyance of fish.Theoretically, lish should be despatched from the ports and arrive at the London termini in accordance with a definite time schedule, and it is a matter for regret that in practice this is not the case. There is ample evidence to show that there are frequently delays en route, and that as a consequence trains often reach London too late to allow delivery to be effected in time for the market..1.7. As a result of these late deliveries, an arrangement has had to be made between the 1 ail way companies and the Billingsgate salesmen, under which, where fish cannot be delivered at the market before 9 a.m., the railway company telephones to the consignee asking whether the fish should be kept back or delivered to the market. When the fish is kept back it means that the railway truck or the railway van in which it has been loaded is kept under load until the next day and is accordingly out of commission.We desire to point out in the strongest possible manner the effect of deliveries of fish to the market being made too late for the day&apos;s sale. Sales should take place at an early hour of the day; the retailer, who in many cases has to come a considerable distance, must get his purchases back&apos; into his shop in time for morning sale to his customers, and cannot afford to wait at the market; in fact, at Billingsgate we are informed that the bulk of the trade must be completed by 9 a.in. If fish is not available for sale well before that hour, competition is increased, and prices accordingly rule higher for whatever fish has succeeded in getting on the market, and this is directly to the detriment of the consumer. The fish that arrived late will in*all probability not be sold until the following day, by which time it has deteriorated in condition, and consequently gives a smaller return to the producer and so to the fishermen.Moreover, so long as there is any uncertainty as to the early arrival of fish at any wholesale market, merchants will restrict their demands accordingly, and less fish will be brought to the market, or, in other words, placed at the disposal of the consumer. There is no doubt whatever that if the fish landed at the ports could invariably be placed on sale at the wholesale markets in good time for the morning retail trade very much larger quantities would be consumed. We have already reported on the waste of fish arising from railway delays; these are, of course, particularly detrimental at the week end, when fish that.misses the Saturday morning market has no chance of sale until Monday.In addition, it may be remarked that fish left over from one day&apos;s sale frequently congests the market on the following day, and a railway delay on a day of short supply may cause abnorm-ally high prices on that day; while the fish which misses the market, should there be a good supply on the following day, may find no purchasers and be entirely wasted.18. The unloading of the trains at the London termini might be done with greater expedition. The construction of the present type of wagon, with narrow doors, dees not facilitate speedy unloading, but apart from this there is considerable room for improve-ment. In this connection particular complaint is made by traders of the slow delivery at Broad Street. At this station the fish train arrives at a high level, and the individual trucks Lave to be brought down to a lower level by means of lifts before they can be unloaded. Sometimes fish which arrives in a large railway wagon has to be transferred to a smaller wagon before being brought down to the low level.Evidence was given by the superintendent and some of the leading merchants of Billingsgate Market that undue delay occurred in the conveyance of rail-borne fish from the stations of arrival to the market, the time taken for the delivery of the load of a single train being placed by these witnesses as high as an average of three hours, covering the time of arrival of the first and last consignments of the same train. The representative of the railway company estimated the period at 2J hours as a general rule, although in the case of Broad Street station he admitted that it might be three hours. The effect of delayed delivery would appear to be that in many cases the merchant loses the sale of a portion of his consignment owing to the market being over before delivery is completed. Merchants also complain that fish of the same quality and from the same port arriving by the same train for different consignees may realise quite different prices according to the state of the market when the delivery is made, so that while one merchant may obtain a good price if he is fortunate in his time of delivery, another may realise only a much lower price, or even lose the sale of his goods altogether.19.   After considering the evidence submitted we are of opinion that: (a) The railway service for inland conveyance of fish from the principal ports should be organised and run to scheduled times in accordance with the exigencies of the wholesale market.(b) The present provision of suitable wagons is inadequate and should be strengthenedwithout delay.(c) A stock of suitable fish wagons should be definitely allocated between the principal&apos;ports of.collection and delivery, which should be specified, and these wagons should not be detached for any other purpose.20: Another matter which should be mentioned in connection with railway transnort is the question of mixed consignments. At most ports the railway companies are responsible for loading the fish trains, while&apos; at Hull the fish merchants perform this service. Although in many cases an effort is made to load consignments to the same salesman in the same wagon, it frequently happens that a consignee has parcels of fish in several&apos;wagons, each wagon conversely, contain-in g consignments for several consignees. This state of things is continued when the fish is loaded into the vans and conveyed to Billingsgate, and it is these mixed consignments which&apos;
tare, in the opinion of the Market Superintendent, largely responsible for the delay which occurs in unloading and freeing the vans. Any system by which the number of these mixed consign-ments could be reduced to a niiiiiinum woiihj undoubtedly be beneficial,Requirements op a Wholesale Fish Market.21. The question next arises as to whether Billingsgate market can be made adequate! to meet the present and future needs of London; but before proceeding to discuss this question, we think&quot; it desirable to stale briefly what, in our opinion, fire the chief requirements of an ideal Fish Market.(a) Such a market should be centrally situated and in a position convenient as far as possible both to the railway termini and to the riverside.(b) The market should not be in too close proximity to main arterial roads, but should have easy access to them. There should be good approaches to the market from all sides, and the market building itself should be provided with thoroughfares sufficiently wide to permit of vans unloading directly on to the stands; in this connection consideration should be given to the probable development of motor traffic. The market should be provided throughout with a simple overhead transport installation (similar to that now in use for meat at the Glasgow Corporation&apos; Meat Market), connecting with each stand and with goods lifts conveniently situated at intervals at suitable points inside the market. By those means packages of fish, empties, etc., could be rapidly and economically moved either within the market, to its exits, or transferred to a basement or upper floor (if any) as required and much labour would thereby be saved.(c) The exterior of the market building should be furnished with loading banks against which the retailers&apos; carts could be brought in order to receive their supplies.(d) The market should be of sufficient area to provide accommodation for the ascertained or estimated requirements of all bond fide applicants for stands who are in a position to obtain1 and dispose of direct supplies of fish.(e) The market building should be divided into stands of such area as to suit the respective requirements of merchants engaged in various branches of the trade, so that the occupation of one or more stands by each merchant would enable him to accommodate the average maximum quantity of fish he is likely to have on hand at one time during market hours. Each stand should be provided with an office preferably over and directly connected with it, and with basement accommodation suitable for re-packing and storage of fish, etc., or the collection and despatch of empties, such accommodation being readily accessible by means of goods lifts, and provided with water supply and efficiently drained.(/) Tn the market building special accommodation should also be made for sales by auction, furnished with mechanical appliances to expedite the clearance of the fish so disposed of.(g) An ice plant should be installed, and arrangements made for the sale of ice to market users. The market should be provided with canteens and other suitable accommodation for the staff, a Market Tenants&apos; Association, etc. It should also include accommodation for cutting up and dressing fish and for the collection&apos;of offal.(h) Salesmen and porters should be licensed, regulations governing sales on commission and other transactions should be drawn up and made compulsory, and salesmen should be required to adopt a. standard form of statement in furnishing account sales to their senders.22. Dealing in the first place with the question of situation, we do not consider that the site of Billingsgate satisfies the conditions laid down in paragraph 21 (a). Geographically, Billingsgate Market is in a central position, and is conveniently placed for handling water-borne fish, but, in view of the fact that more than 90 per cent, of the fish brought to Billingsgate is now rail-borne, and that, in our opinion, the proportion of water-borne fish is not likely to be increased beyond 20 per cent, of the present average total supplies, we consider that, market facilities being equal in other respects, convenience to the railway systems concerned must be the ruling factor in our decision.We have given careful consideration to the possibilities of a substantial increase in the quantity of fish brought to London by water. The present position has already been stated (see paragraph 7). It has been represented that as much as an average supply of 400 tons daily could be delivered in this manner from Hull and Grimsby if adequate facilities for landing fish could be provided ; but we do not consider, after having heard the evidence, that this estimate can be accepted. The actual proposals for an increase of fleeting will not, if and when carried out, provide for more than a daily average of 150 tons. For the balance, the supporters of the estimate rely on direct supply by trawlers. This would admittedly lengthen the period of the voyage, entail frequent returns-to ports of origin, and subject a large percentage of the London supplies to the hazard of adverse weather and delays in the Thames. We are informed that East Coast fishermen are not in favour of this scheme under existing conditions; and without the definite establishment of a fishing fleet working from the Port of London, we do not consider that supplies could be guaranteed adequate to the maintenance of reasonable prices to the oon-sumer. London at present obtains supplies of fish from most of the fishing ports in the United Kingdom, and to feed its population must be in a position to draw upon as many sources of supply as possible. It would obviously be unsafe to rely on the occasional diversion of trawlers from their ports of origin. No trawler owner could be expected to adopt this method of disposing of part of Iris catch without the knowledge of what his competitors were doing. The only induce-ment which would weigh with the trawler owner would be the probability of obtaining higher prices in London, and tins argument can hardly be said to be to the advantage of the consumer.31285 a 4
At the samp time we are of opinion, in view of the importance of reinforcing the main fish supply of London as far as.possible with water-borne supplies, that the facilities at present pro-vided for landing fish should be extended, equipped with modern appliances and generally placed on an efficient and economical basis.23. A table (Appendix IV) is attached showing the distances to Billingsgate Market from the various station and the quantities of fish carted from each of those stations during the twelve months ending 30th September, 1020.Of the total gross tonnage, namely 258,301, referred to, 141,008 tons were carted distances of from to 4g miles. The tonnage handled at Mint Street, the nearest station tci Billings-gate Market, namely, 23,382 tons would naturally, if a more convenient site could be found, be worked from King&apos;s Cross. The remaining deliveries of importance are 51,523 tons delivered at Bishopsgate and Liverpool Street, and 34,771 tons delivered at Broad Street. These stations are approximately about 1 mile distant from Billingsgate.24. If, therefore, a site could be found which materially reduces the longer distances first referred to without appreciably increasing the distances from the Great Eastern and the London and North Western stations, 97 per cent, of the rail-borne traffic could be excluded from the highly congested City area-; that passing from the eastern-most stations would clear the city by direct main routes, along which a regular How of traffic is easily maintained.It would appear to be desirable to look for such a site in the area between llolborn and the Euston Road. Such a site would effect a very considerable saving in the cost of transport. The delivery of the bulk of the fish to the market would be greatly expedited in point of time, with a resultant saving of waste for the causes indicated in our second report, and a consequenti all round advantage both to tho retailer and to the consumer. Additional cartage would have to be undertaken in respect of the water-borne supplies landed at -Billingsgate, but in regard to this we point out that this traffic would consist of wholesale delivery only, and that arrange-ment should, if possible, be made for the use.; of tin; Custom House Quay for the loading and dispatch of the vans required, and also for the wholesale sale on the quay of such supplies. The fishermen insist on all trawl-caught fish being sold by public auction on landing.25. With regard to the requirement stated in paragraph 21 (6), Billingsgate Market cannot be said to have easy access to any main arterial road. Only one face of it abuts on a thoroughfare, and this is one of the most serious defects in the transaction of the market business.At Billingsgate it is not possible for any van to unload directly on to a stand.26. The Corporation of the City of London had given consideration to the improvement of Billingsgate Market before the war, but no detailed plans had been prepared. We understand that progress has since been made in the execution of a scheme which provides for the construc-tion of a floor between the ground floor and the basement of the market, to which ingress&apos;and egress will be afforded by means of lifts and gravity conveyors. This provides an additional area of 5,000 feet super for the reception of fish, and this portion of the work is already well advanced.In order to carry out this scheme it would be useful to obtain permission to use part of the space belonging to the Custom House. . This concession has not&apos; yet been granted by the Office of Works. The cost of this part of the scheme is estimated at 121,000, but it is stated that in spite of the additional space thus provided it will not be possible to admit an increased number of salesmen to the market. In this connection, it should be noted that there is at present a waiting list of applicants for stands.A limited company has been formed, the issue of shares being confined so far as practicable to tenants and others immediately connected with Billingsgate, for the purpose of providing cold storage and ice-making facilities within the market.- and taking up a long lease of a portion of the basement premises hitherto used as a store of empties for this purpose. This scheme has been approved by the Corporation of the City of London.It has been suggested that the Custom House as well as the Custom House Quay should be acquired for the purposes of extending the market. The Custom House building is entirely unsuitable for that purpose, and the adoption of this suggestion would entail not only the re-building of a market embracing both the present Billingsgate Market and the Custom House building, but also the provision of another building for the purposes of the Custom House authorities. We are of opinion that this undertaking would be not less onerous than the establishment of a new central market on i inland site, especially when the site value, less the quay of the present Billingsgate Market, &apos; et off against the expense of the proposed new inland market.It has further been suggested (see. Appendix V) that by the adoption of a system of motor tractors and trailers the congestion can be obviated. We are informed that no practical demon-strati on of this system is at present possible, as the tractors and trailers have not yet been used in this country; and evidence has been given that the use of modern motors in the narrow streets adjacent to&apos;the market is practically impossible. We are of opinion, moreover, that the adoption of the plan, even if practicable, would only produce; a more severe congestion in a somewhat less area, that it would not effect a. saving of labour nor relievo the congested conditions under which the fish is at present sold in the market building itself. If the huge cost of an1 extensive street widening scheme is to be added to that of acquiring the Custom House and re-building the market on larger lines, we are decidedly of opinion that it is better to establish an efficient market planned in accordance with modern requirements and suitably equipped as set out in paragraph 21. ,
Memorandum by Sir George Bettesworth Piggott, K.B.E., J.P., L.C.C.I am of opinion that the present congested conditions under which fish is brought into and dealt with at Billingsgate Market cannot possibly continue. For water-borne fish I think there will always be a necessity to retain Billingsgate, but this must be under much improved and modern conditions. It is surprising that so little has been done up to the present to rectify to some degree the patent defects of the present system or to meet the modern&apos; requirements of a well-organised market. The present market should be re-organised and brought up to date, more room should be provided, the gangways, which are very narrow and congested, should be enlarged -mechanical and labour-saving appliances should be used-additional accommodation for further &quot; carriers &quot; alongside the quay is required and better arrangements for landing consignments of fish. There should also be cold storage accommodation to provide for gluts of fish which are not too infrequent.With regard to the rail-borne fish, there is no doubt that the large amount of traffic to the market has for some time outgrown entirely the present facilities of ingress and egress so neces-sary for the quick delivery and distribution of the big consignments of fish coming by rail, causing also unneocessary delay-the vans standing about for hours which increases the cost of delivery and therefore the cost of the fish. There does not appear any likelihood of this traffic decreasing in volume to any appreciable extent.27. We are of opinion that, while some measures of relief of the market are advisable and indeed urgent where too great an expenditure is not involved as for instance the provision of facilities for dealing with water-borne fish, the fact that under none of the more elaborate schemes can provision be made for easy access to the whole of the market building is in itself an insuperable-able objection to any further substantial expenditure of money on the re-organisation of Billings-gate Market. We recognise that under existing conditions the acquisition of a. new site and erection of a new central market must involve both considerable delay and expense, and in the meantime this important industry must not be interrupted.28.   We therefore recommend : (1) That increased facilities should be provided at Billingsgate for landing fish, with aview to encouraging this method of transport. (2) That increased facilities should be given at Billingsgate for selling by auction and marketing by wholesale the sea-borne fish landed there. (3) That a central fish market for London should be established on a site elsewhere thanat Billingsgate.We recommend that a suitable site should be secured without further delay, and, con-sidering that the market provides directly for a, population of considerably more than one quarter of the population of England and Wales, as well as indirectly for the needs to some extend of other parts of the country, we urge the (government to take steps to place such a site at the disposal of the Market Authority, which it is hoped will be now constituted.We do not overlook the fact that a considerable number of traders associated with Billings-gate Market are in occupation of premises outside the market building within its immediate neighbourhood. If an adequate market building can be provided on the lines suggested above it is not anticipated that there will be any serious difficulty in making provision for the removal of these businesses to the new market, subject, of course, to such equitable terms of compensation as may be agreed with a proper authority.29. In making the above recommendations we do not desire that the opinion of the trade as expressed to us should be overlooked, and we are bound to admit that while some witnesses have agreed that a new central market might well be established providing facilities far superior to any now possible at Billingsgate, the general feeling of the trade, as expressed to the Com-mittee, has been against any removal of the market from its present site. We consider that this arises in great part from a natural objection on the part of those associated with a very old established institution to any alterations in the conditions under which they have hitherto carried on their trade. On the other hand, we are convinced that this reform will ultimately result not only in distinct benefit to the producers of fish and all branches of the fishing industry, but to the consumer; and, moreover, that that the removal of the fish traffic from the Billingsgate neighbourhood has become an absolute necessity in the general interests of the City trade.(Signed)      E.

The enormous expense of improving the main arteries leading to Billingsgate Market would be far too costly to contemplate seriously. The time, therefore, has arrived when accommodation for a second Fish Market for London should bo seriously considered to accommodate all rail-borne fish. This market should have all the amenities and modern improvements suggested in the majority report.Transport of fish by rail needs much improved methods and should be expedited. The railway companies should be required to run their trains to a more regular scheduled time, and the trucks and vans for the conveyance of fish, both on rail and road, should be of a more approved fashion and up-to-date, to prevent deterioration.No doubt the suggestion of a second fish market for London will meet with opposition in certain quarters and by some of the stall holders and salesmen at Billingsgate Market where vested interests and prejudice against any innovation are strong.In considering the question of a new market, therefore, these factors will have to be taken into consideration. The re-organisation of Billingsgate Market and the traffic problem requires to be placed in expert hands and should be dealt with only after the most careful consideration.G. BETTESWORTH PIGGOTT.11th October, 1920,Memorandum by Capt. W. J. Wade, M.B.E.I desire to draw attention to two points in the report, the importance of which, in my opinion, the committee&apos;s recommendations do not sufficiently emphasise, namely : (1) That it is contrary to the public interest that approximately one-third of the Whole-sale Fish Trade at Billingsgate is transacted in private premises adjacent to the market.   (See clause 8.)The granting to Public Authorities of statutory powers in relation to the management of markets in order that they shall regulate the conditions under which food may be sold and handled, and also the tenancy of stalls or holdings in the great &quot; clearing houses &quot; for food, such as Billingsgate constitutes, establishes a principle which has been allowed to lapse in the case of Billingsgate to the extent quoted.(2) In regard to the opinion expressed by the Committee as to the inadequacy of the present provision of &quot; suitable &quot; wagons for fish traffic. (See clause 19, sec. 6 and c.)I am of opinion that it is not sufficiently realised how great a proportion of preventable wastage of all kinds of food is due directly or indirectly to the causes mentioned.As principal administrative official for many years of one of the largest composite market undertakings in the Kingdom, which includes wholesale markets for meat, fish and poultry, fruit and vegetables, etc., also abattoirs and cold stores, and the supervision of the inspectors appointed under the Public Health Acts, whose duties include the prevention of exposure for sale throughout the City of Manchester of diseased or unsound food, I am probably in a some-what unique position to appreciate the tremendous wastage which occurs from these causes.I am convinced that the actual loss or deterioration of all classes of imported refrigerated produce, and also of fish, fresh meat, dairy produce, fruit and vegetables, etc., as a result of inadequate or defective transport services between the ports and producing areas of this country and the centres of consumption, represents a sum which is enormous though incalculable.A study, extending over many years, of the many problems relating to cold storage, including that of the transport of refrigerated and other perishable produce, leads me to believe that the greater part of this wastage is preventable, and could be obviated by the provision of an adequate and efficient service of irhvlated and (or) refrigerated raihoay and mad transport vehicles, specially reserved for the conveyance of foodstuffs.WM. J. WADE.14th October, 1920.MINORITY REPORT.It is with extreme regret that we find ourselves unable to agree with the Report of the majority of our Colleagues.In our judgment the evidence which has been adduced does not justify the stringent strictures which have been passed, or the recommendations made, condemning Billingsgate Market, when it is common knowledge that the Corporation, as the owner of the market, is, at the moment, engaged in making considerable alterations, which will materially increase the facilities at present existing for carrying on the fish business at that market.We do not consider sufficient attention has been given to the representations which have been put forward on behalf of the London Fish Trades&apos; Association, an association entitled to be regarded as an expert authority upon the London fish trade; and we think it would be only fair to that authority for the recommendations they have made, together with the valuable plans supplied, including that of the Port of London Authority, to receive further consideration and to form part of the Appendices to the Report.
Report by Lt.-General Sir Francis Lloyd^ G;C;V.O., K.C.B., D.S.O;It is with extreme regret that I find myself unable to agree with the report of the majorityof my colleagues. .       . .I should have preferred greater attention being given to the representations which have put forward on behalf of the London Fish Trades&apos; Association, an association entitled to be regarded as an expert authority upon the London fish trade.I am strongly of opinion that Billingsgate Market should be retained as the principal Fish Market for London, both for wholesale and retail purposes, but in order that it may be so retained, very crreat structural and other improvements must be undertaken. It is a matter of common knowledge that the Corporation of the City of London are undertaking improvements, but I am of opinion that they should go still further, and also that the Custom House Quay should be obtained and improved.In justification of this comment, we may mention that it is within our knowledge that the scheme and plans prepared by that association, under which the trade would take delivery of fish at the railway termini, have been submitted to our Committee and to the Assistant Coin-missioner of the City Police, who has informed the Town Clerk that, with the proposed increased accommodation for water-borne fish and additional market accommodation with increased space for vehicular traffic and the organisation of a suitable motor service to secure the delivery of rail way-borne fish at the market at an earlier hour than at present, the present congestion around the market would, in the opinion of the police, be removedv The practicability of standing a number of detached trailers in the streets, is, in the opinion of the Assistant Com-missioner, open to question; but he sees no reason why a motor service could not be secured to suitably meet traffic requirements.It must be understood that we are not committing ourselves to the scheme in detail; but, in our judgment, it forms a basis upon which a workable scheme could undoubtedly be framed for satisfactorily meeting the requirements of the situation, including relief to the railway com-panies in connection with the alleged undue retention of their vans, and eventually superseding the delivery by railway vans.We refer to it as showing the necessity for more consideration being given to a scheme put forward by such an Association, before making the drastic recommendations to which we take exception.On the subject of the increase of water-borne fish, we do not think due consideration has been given to the suggestions which have been made in conjunction with a scheme capable of being carried through with the already secured willing co-operation of the Port of London Authority, by means of which, assuming Plis Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to regard this matter, as undoubtedly it is, a national question, and afford facilities to the Corporation, as the Market Authority, for extending Billingsgate by the use of Custom House Qnay and river frontage, approximately one-half of the total quantity of fish delivered at Billingsgate, would be dealt with by water supply, with provision for, each vessel discharging on ton the market direct.In support of our unanimous view that every endeavour should be made to retain Billings-gate as the one central market for the supply of fish to London, we would call&quot;attention to the representations to that effect which have been made to the Committee by the following Associa,-tions, indicative of the considered opinion of all the principal branches of the Industry :  National Sea Fisheries&apos; Protection Association.British Trawlers&apos; Federation,.Ltd.Hull Fishing Vessels Owners&apos; Association.Grimsby Fishing Vessels Owners&apos; Association.London Fish Trade Association.London Retailers&apos; Association.London Fish Friers&apos; Association.Owners of Fishing Fleet running to Billingsgate.Poulterers and Tenants of Leadenhall Market.We respectfully suggest that a grave mistake would be made to practically annihilate Bill-ingsgate as the recognised Central Market for fish, until the effect of the various alterations and additions to that market, arid the carrying out of the scheme to which we have referred, have been fairly tried.The expense thereby entailed would involve only a small fraction of the outlay of public money which would be necessary to set up&quot; a new Market.It is so easy to destroy a market; but most difficult to create one, as evidenced by the failures of the Shadwell Fish Market, the Columbia Market and the Portman Market   all intended to benefit the public, but unsuccessfully.(Sgd.)     HINDLIP.LULHAM POUND. HUBERT J.  GREENWOOD. PHILIP B.   PROCTOR. G. C. H. WHELER.
The great difficulty is the incoming and outgoing street traffic. Plans are in contemplation for the improvement of this by motor instead of horse transport. These have had no trial, but as I believe motor transport must be the future of all transport, I think that some trial ought to be given to it. .While retaining Billingsgate, it is possible that another and more central market might be temporarily instituted and given a trial for rail-borne fish. I do not think this is absolutely necessary, but I see no objection to it, although I know that the fish traders are against it.(Sgd.)     FRANCIS LLOYD, 35, Park Street, W.l. Lieutenant-General.22nd October, 1920.Report by Mr. C. B. Fisher, C.B.E.Although agreeing with the report in most respects, I regret.I cannot append my signature to the recommendation : &quot; That a central fish market for London should be established on a site elsewhere than at Billingsgate,&quot; and &quot; that a suitable site should be secured without further delay.&quot;The signatories to the report &quot; recognise that under existing conditions the acquisition of a new site and erection of a new central market must involve both considerable delay and expense,&quot; and I wish to emphasize the urgency of the establishment of the Central Market Authority as recommended by this Committee, by whom all these points should be dealt with in relation to their practical expediency and financial, possibilities.I agree with the report that there should be one central market and that Billinsgate as at present constituted is unsuitable.I am convinced that encouragement should be given to seaborne fish, delivered as it can be, at less cost and in better condition.The projected scheme for the erection of a new jetty at the Custom House and Market Quays will make provision for the landing of the fish and for selling by auction and marketing to whole-wholesalers, and will enable the space used for the sale of sea-borne fish in the market to be utilised for further stalls.The removal of the market would do away with the present beneficial method of dealing with condemned fish.I agree that the railway service is far from satisfactory and with the recommendations for effecting improvement in the service and method of conveyance. The work is now being pro-ceeded with :1.   To provide an additional area of 5,000 feet super at an estimated cost of  21,000;2.   The erection of the ice-making and cold storage plant in the lower basement; will fulfil two of the serious requirements of the present market, and if the simple overhead transport installation as used at the Glasgow Corporation Market, was adopted, it would bei an enormous saving in time and labour.It would be impossible for these improvements to be fully effective unless some measures are taken to remedy the present traffic congestion.There is only one method by which this can be attained, and this is by the utilization of the Customs House Quay. Adjoining as it does the market itself it could be connected up with the market scheme of overhead transport, at present put to no useful purpose. Tt is a very valuable site, but it could not be used for any purpose which would be detrimental to the Customs House as long as the Customs House remains. The use of it for vans and trolleys would bei in no way detrimental, but would afford an enormous relief to the present congestion and facilitate the expeditious marketing of the fish.It would enable all traffic in the streets adjoining to be directed from west to east, and possibly by some improvement of Water Lane an expeditious exit would be found into Easteheap.I do not agree that motor traffic under these conditions would be impossible ; motors are far more easily controlled than horses; their carrying capacity is greater than horse-drawn vehicles, and the space utilized is less.A large number of lorries could be-aecommodated in the Customs House Quay.I do not consider that the Committee has had sufficient information as to thei comparative expenditure on the purchase and laying out of a new market, and the cost of compensation of vested interests, or of the value of the present one to justify them in coming to the conclusion that a new central fish market should be established and that a suitable site should be acquired without delay. -The other recommendations dealing with railway facilities; further accommodation for sea-borne fish; the better mechanical facilities in the market; the work already being carried out giving further floor space and cold storage, are all steps in! the right direction, and nothing would be gained by the precipitation of a large expenditure of public money when developments are taking place on right lines, which time may prove to have been effectual, and when there is more serious need for economy than has ever occurred in the financial history of the country.(Sgd.)

V.Proposed Scheme for the Re-OrganisatiOn op the Existing Cartage Arrangements in Connection with the Delivery of Rail-Borne Fish to Billingsgate Market by the Adoption of In-dependent Motor Transport.(Submitted by the London Fish Trade Association.)Main Featur.es of the Proposed Scheme are:  Provision of, say, 50 Motor Tractors, capable of moving 14 tons at a speed of from 1 to 13 miles per hour, and 200 Lorries with a small outer rail in lieu of side, having a carrying capacity of 5 tons.The Tractors and Lorries to bo allocated amongst the various Railway Depots for cartagei of fish, ac-cording to traffic requirements.Each Tractor to haul two lorry loads per journey, and to ply between&apos;the various depots as required. Lorries, after being placed in position at the stations for loading, and at the Market for unloading, could be left until that work is completed, thus affording the maximum storage and haulage facilities at a minimum cost.With wheels locking either end, perfect mobility of the vehicles is assured, enabling any particular lorry to be removed at any moment from its position and to be put into working with the Tractor.Advantages of the Scheme in Believing the Covges-tion and Accelerating the Handling and Distribu-tion of Fish: The Railway Companies would be relieved of the cartage of tho Fish Traffic, giving them full use of their teams for general merchandise, and eliminating, entirely any grounds for complaints respecting tho detention of their teams or the returning of con-signmente to the stations.Two loads of fish could stand where, to-day, one only is possible, the second load occupying tho space that to-day is required for the horses.Trolley and Horses to-day  ..,   Length 25 to26 feet.Proposed-Two Trolleys      ...   Length 26 feet.
The Economy of Space thus secured would allow of a greater portion of the traffic being brought close to the Market, thus giving space in closer proximity to the MaTket for buyers&apos; vehicles. A large saving in porterage, both to and from tho Market and shops, and also to tho buyers&apos; vehicles, naturally follows.Unity of control of the cartage will ensure that vehicles will always be available for wherever tho pressure arises. There is, under the present system, no interchange between the companies, and when large supplies brought by one create a shortage of delivery teams, those which have only light work cannot assist.It follows further from the samo unity of control that part loads could be transferred and full loads made. This, carried out at suitable times, will mean the release of many trollies during busy market hours, and further concentration, giving room for later ar-rivals when necessary or clearing the area for wharf or other traffic.Tho Salesmen will havo greater facilities for dis-tribution when necessary, either to Cold Storage orRailway Stations, tho present difficulties or refusals by tho Railway Companies being eliminated.Unity of control also affords tho opportunity of bettor allocation of tho vehicles in the vicinity, i,e., it would be known to what extent vehicles would be arriving from tho various companies, and so afford the opportunity for arranging for the vehicles from ono company to bo put together in a section. By such an arrangement the working would be further accelerated through the salesmen knowing the location of their consignments from a particular Port or Railway Company.Tho acquisition of a few light single motor vans would bo advantageous for dealing with small odd con-signments; also with such vans a reliable distribution to various districts might be organised, thus enabling buyers to purchase and havo their goods sent home without bringing their own vehicles to the Market. The consequent reduction in the number of buyers&apos; carts at the Market would further allay the con-gestion.
