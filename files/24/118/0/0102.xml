You will have gathered from our last weekly telegram our views as to political situation. We arc examining the question of our general policy towards non-co-operation and in relation to internal questions which are among the causes of discontent, and we hope shortly to be in a position, after consulting Local Governments on certain points, to formulate in detail the measures we propose to take to deal with the situation. One of the most dangerous factors in problem which confronts us is, however, Moslem unrest over the Turkish peace terms. Whatever may have been origin of the Khilafat movement, it is now pre-eminently a religions one which has secured very general support. Even loyal Mohamedans, feeling rightly or wrongly that the terms are not just or consistent with published pledges, are unable to oppose movement or face the religious pressure that is brought to bear on them, more especially the accusation of being Kafirs. So far the movement has not resulted in violence, save in one or two places, because the policy of the leader of the campaign is, at any rate for the present, to avoid violence; but we have reason to know that extreme Mohamedan leaders are quite prepared to advocate immediate recourse to violence, and are confident of securing support for such a move, both within and (outside India, by an appeal to ignorant and fanatical Mohamedans that Islam is being crushed ; the danger of disorder will also be greater when the non-violence programme fails. In these circumstances, we fear that the refusal substantially to modify the Turkish peace terms, more particularly because of the general and deep-rooted conviction that England alone blocks the way, may have consequences of a very grave character on the peace and tranquillity of this country, and we feel it incumbent on us, in view of our responsibility to His Majesty&apos;s Government, to Parliament and to the people of India once more to place on official record, in the plainest language, our deep misgivings on this subject. It is our considered opinion that the only way of eradicating or even allaying Moslem (? excitement) is by a real modification of treaty. The difficulties which the Turkish peace terms have created in our foreign relations, more particularly in regard to peace negotiations with Afghanistan and the Persian crisis ; the facilities they afford for Pan-Islamic intrigue and Bolshevik propaganda, and the dangerous effect which the religious feeling created thereby must have on Indian Mahomedan soldiers, have already been placed before you, and the present telegram is intended to deal with the internal situation only. From this aspect we venture to urge once again that you should place before His Majesty&apos;s Government our reading of the situation here, and impress upon them the urgent need for a modification of the treaty, not merely in the interests of His Majesty&apos;s Indian Moslem subjects, but for preservation of tranquillity in India. We are well (? aware) (? that the) extremist class of political agitators will not be appeased by any such modinca-tion, but we feel that if you succeed in securing it, you will strengthen very greatly the hands of our friends, detach a most influential section of Mohamedan (? opinion), namely, the section actuated by religious motives, from the present anti-Government agitation, and will materially assist us in avoiding serious internal disorder,3I3234    100 1.21
