(P. 480) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 845&apos;20th January 1921.(Received 8.15 p.m.)Clear the line.US S. Following from Dobbs, dated 18th January: &quot;To-day Muspratt and I had nearly five hours&apos; private conference with Tarsi and Nadir Khan. They definitely assured us that: &quot; (.1) Treaty with Russia is not yet ratified, and even it Moscow ratifies, Afghanistan can still refuse to do so.&quot;(2) If Afghanistan satisfied as to our friendship during friendship discussion, she will not ratify any clause hostile to the British Government which may exist in draft, such as those giving facilities for transmission of arms to tribes and promising establishment of consulates oil our borders, and will include in treaty with the British Government definite undertaking not to adopt such proposals. They hinted arms clause did not exist.&quot; (3) So far as Afghanistan is concerned, present idea is that Jamal, whom Tarsi characterised as a Mihtar, shall be employed merely for the purpose of advising regarding re-organisation of the Army, in same way as existing Turkish instructor, Mali mud Sami, but will not be allowed to organise propaganda and dealings with frontier tribes. If he has other schemes, Afghanistan has no cognisance of them. Regarding my request for communication of terms of draft agreement, they said that they could not comply at present stage of negotiations. In course of discussion, Tarsi said proper means of stopping Bolshevik propaganda in East was for British to get Bolsheviks to agree to do so. This would be great relief to Afghanistan, but he did not believe Bolsheviks would ever give such an undertaking. Nadir enlarged, upon hostility of almost all the world, and especially Islam, towards Great Britain, and said that Afghanistan would incur such odium from (corrupt group) tribes and from Indian Moslems, if they made friendship with Great Britain, that they must receive an ample quid pro quo.&quot; (4) lie quoted resolution of Moslem Conference, asking Afghanistan not to make friendship with us. He then said that he wanted assurance from us that we would reconsider non possumus attitude, adopted at Mussoorie, regarding our frontier tribes. All other questions between us could be decided at one or .two sittings. But question of tribes remained great obstacle in the way of friendship. I replied that I could give no hope of any such alteration, but that I would be willing to discuss any proposal that Afghans might suggest for making our mutual attitude regarding British frontier tribes more friendly, and eliminating as far as possible bitter feeling and difficulties which tribal questions have constantly aroused between us. I, of course, contested Afghan arguments. First official conference will probably be held on 20th instant.   Nadir will attend whenever frontier matters are discussed.&quot;
