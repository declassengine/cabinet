This DcFfeoertv of(P 22)From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department,1031st December 1920.(Received 1st January 1921, 9 a,in.)Priority A.1501 S. Afghanistan. Your telegram of 24th December last, 4295. We are fully alive to dangerous potentialities of Jamal Pasha&apos;s Mission, and Dobbs has been instructed to keep ears and eyes open and do his best to gain knowledge of the situation. Any attempt, however, on the part of Mission at investigation or secret intelligence work regarding these or other plots by hostile elements at Kabul would be highly impolitic. They wrould almost inevitably be discovered, and would ruin the prospect of gaining Amir&apos;s confidence. Circumstances may, of course, alter Dobbs&apos; plans, but his present idea is to start discussions at Kabul by frank statement of all we have been able to gather regarding schemes and activities of both Suritz and Jamal, and to explain to Afghans that confidence and negotiations for treaty of. friendship between us are very difficult, if not impossible, until Afghan attitude and views with regard to these matters are cleared up. This line of action will, we hope, force them to show their hand.
