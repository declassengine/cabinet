The Trade Unions are talcing up the problem keenly and ire showing a sweet reasonableness which may bear fruit a little later. l-t is impossible yet to say how far their attitude is inspired by the &apos;ear that their followers may revolt.It is not surprising that the Communists are gaining converts, they are very active and the unemployed have time now to attend meetings :iany are beginning to believe that the root cause of their troubles is the capitalist system.   There is an increase in class hatred which may have serious results before the winter is over.The report of the Labour Delegation to Ireland, founded on pi narte statements, is to be widely exploited by means of a national lampaign throughout the country.An attempt is being made to unite the various Socialist Sunday Schools into a &quot;Young Communist International&quot; under the control of foe cow.The Scottish divisional conference of the Independent Labour -arty has reversed its decision of last year in favour of affiliating frith the Third International.
The unemployment problem grows graver every week, but it ie doubtful whether, even now, we have touched more than tho fringe of it,     Tho one hopeful sign is the tendency of several trade unions to approach the subject in co-operation with the employers:   Ben Tillett, M.P., in a letter written on behalf of the Doc):, Wharf, Riverside and-General WorkersT Union to urge that a,special meeting of tho Traders Union Congress Parliamentary,Committee be called, emphasises the necessity for consultation &quot;with the most responsible of the representatives of employers&apos; organisations.&quot;    At the same time, he repudiates the Government&apos;s method of selecting individuals for consultation and concludes &quot;In view of the failure of the Industrial, Conference, the Cabinet, the Labour Ministry, and even our own movement to handle the question of unemployment, we consider the problem should be tackled in all seriousness at once.     The first step to be taken to be the elimination of personal intervention end the subvention of organised and responsible representatives.&quot; .   ,The Government proposals in regard to short time have not, been well received by Labour leaders and have -awakened serious misgivings among the workers themselves, who not unnaturally fear that wages will be forced below subsistence level. . If a statement could be made to the effect that when, as a result of short time, wages touch a certain figure, a portion of the unemployment dole would be available, these fears might be allayed.     Th any case it is clear that even short spells of work mitigate the demoralisation of dolesThe general public views with considerable alarm the commercial position of the country and the growing unemployment. On the one band it is urged that practically no industry can at present afford to support its unemployed:   if a pool were collected in a period of prosperity the scheme might be practicable at some future date.     It is thought that the refusal/
-   -refusal of the banks to make advances en Bills of Lading and stocks will have the effect during the next few weeks of wiping out a number of the smaller trading concerns and middle men, thus further aggravating unemployment. In some financh circles the view is held that a speedy recovery is impossible and that next winter may be far worse than this. Dividends in 1981 will be greatly reduced, if they do not even temporari disappear, for many concerns are aiming only at keeping their business alive.&apos; Consequently the position of the shareholder in industrial concerns is likely to be deplorable. The present reduction of prices is due almost entirely to the fact that firms are forced to out their losses in order to raise money for current expenses: when stocks are cleared, a furth increase is likely as there is no likelihood of lowering the cost of production, except by reducing wages. Attempts on t part of the employers to effect such a reduction are expected Labour and will bo resisted to the utmost: a struggle is likely to ensue, already heral.ded by the strike of shipyard joiners.From all districts come reports of increasing unemployed and distress:   in Lancashire depression is almost general, th\ cotton, engineering and shipbuilding, iron and steel rolling, soap, chemical, paper, salt, hatting, tanning, leather manufacturing, general cJoofc and transport industries being specifically mentioned.    Operatives in the lace and hosiery trades at Nottingham were entirely suspended during the past week; at Long Eaton the situation is worse, practically allt factories being on short time.    There is also a slump in the iron and steel industry in Nottinghamshire, said to be greatl; due to foreign competition.   In Coventry, where the majority of the unemployed are skilled mechanics and tradesmen, the situation Is reported to be becoming more serious each week. Tho extremist Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee is very active and/
and processions to the various works are again being made: there is,   however, considerable friction between this committee and the local officials of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, whose powers the committee is attempting to usurp.Although the position in Birmingham remains stationary, there seem to be signs- of coming improvement: great efforts have been made during the Christmas season to relieve distress.It is reported that trade in Yorkshire is becoming consistently worse and as some 60 per cent of the clothing workers, practically all the textile workers and many of the engineers, are on short time, little alleviation is possible under the Government scheme.Tyneside does not appear to be so seriously affected as other parts of the country, but the outlook in the engineering and shipbuilding trades is dark.As seems inevitable under conditions of widespread distress and discontent, the communists are gaining converts: the facts relating to unemployment are indisputable and they form a powerful weapon for attacking the capitalist system; the workless are only too ready to believe that their lot could not be worse under a different form of government and might conceivably be better. The right to work is one which it is difficult to deny and Soviet Russia is held up as a Utopia where work is not only a right but a duty.Class hatred is increasing; my Glasgow correspondents, for instance, report that they have nev^r known such bitterness on the part of the workers against anyone who is even slightly better placed than they are themselves; the same thing applies in London, where the Bast end is becoming increasingly familiar with the luxury and ostentation displayed in the West.The revolutionaries, who have been exploiting the unemployed were responsible for a somewhat serious riot on January 3rd. Hans had been laid for a combined attack of the unemployables from Islington, St, Pancras, Edmonton and other districts on theIslington/
Islington Town Hall, from which they had boon removed, by       I the Police on December 29th.   Tho men, who numbered about      ff\ 600, attempted to rush the Hall after being told that the Mayor was not present and had to be charged by foot and mounted police.   Nineteen persons wero arrested for various offences, some of whom were in possession of daggers and pieces of load and iron as clubs.   Thirteen policomsn were injured, The attack was organised by a revolutionary named  .&apos;J3nnett, who had arranged for a simultaneous demonstration at the Library and other places in order to distract the attention of the police.   Lengths of lead were served out to the rioters with their food rations at likLmonton Town Hall.The Southwark unemployed have taken possession of a small house, Wo. 15, Globe Street; the men have given the landlord a promise not to damage any fixtures.On december  9th about 100 unemployed men held a meeting in Kensington Public Library but decided afterwards to leave the building.Late on the night of the 4th, the Gwaun-cae-Gurwen Colliery^ workmen on strike attacked tho house of the Manager, Mr, D. M, Jones, and did considerable damage.   No further disorder is anticipated for the moment.tk6 COMMUNISTS   &quot;The leaders of the various communist groups are working hard to make the forthcoming unity convention a success as they know that on it depends their future support from Russia.   It has been openly stated by the leaders of the Coventry branch that if unification be effected, there will be no more financial difficulties.   Their speakers, meanwhile, are concentrating on unemployment, and in spite of the monotony of their speeches in which it is always asserted that unemployment is part of the capitalist system, aopear to be gaining converts.   There is a natural/
natural tendency on the part of the unenroloyed to believe that nothing can be worse than their present conditions and they have moreover ample time to listen to and absorb r evolutionary do ctrine s.Robert Williams informed the recent communist conference which he attended at -Berlin that the movement in England, which was fairly strong two months ago, had greatly weakened of late, owing to the reduction in prices.   Wo substantiation for to is statement is yet apparent, however, for although the actual membership of the communist parties fluctuates very little, they are certainly obtaining a better hearing and encounter practically no opposition.In Glasgow the&apos;quarrel between the factions represented by John McLean and (lt Gal lac her proceeds with increasing violence.   Anything even approaching fusion seems out of the question, but it is possible that John lie Lean-, whose following is unimportant except for purposes of disorder, will be ignored by the other groups, or become absorbed in the -Socialist Labour Party.On Dacember: 26th Eden Paul, who has recently become active, addressed&apos;a meeting in the Secular Hall, Leicester, His speech was a eulogy of Marx and Lenin: temporary retirement has not cooled the temperature of his sentiments.Francis Tieynell is reported to have said that on his last return from Scandinavia he brought with him an apparently innocent; box of chocolate creams.   He had scooped out the cream and embedded diamonds in its place.DIHHBR&quot; TO C- L. MAX,(MSOn January 3rd the Central London branch of the Communist Party of Great Britain gave a farewell dinner to IJalone at the- Shafts sbury/
Shaftesbury Hotel: seventy people were present and a collection was taken in aid of the &apos;f Mai one Defence  -Fund&quot;. Tom Mann took the chair and made a short speech in which he urged his audience to stand together as the hour was approach-ing when something definite would be achieved.   Robert Williams, who then spoke, said: &quot;Perhaps my turn will come next.   I should not hesitate for one moment to repeat th* kind of speech made by Malone ... There are men as willing as him working for the destruction of the present system.   This movement will go on and for every one in prison there will be ten converts, for I think that all the things that produced the revolution in Russia and Go^many are operating in this country.&quot;Arthur MacMrnus also stated that he entirely supported the sentiment of Maione&apos;s speech and proceeded to criticise the tone of William18 remarks.   Johnson, of the Irish Transport Workers, then addressed the gathering and after a few other short speeches Malone was called upon.   PU deplored the differences between the various extremist groups and hoped when he came out of prison to find one united communist party. He concluded by saying that he would not drink to the health of the assembly &quot;for if you are working lor the cause   your health will be considerably undermined.&quot;The shadow of prison seemed to hang over the gathering, for the proceedings were throughout singularly lacking in the fire of revolution.THE &quot;YOUNG COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL&quot;    ,Margery Newbold is doing her.best to carry out instructions from Moscow and unite the various extremist children1u movements It is now announced that as the result of a joint meeting of theYoung/
i 9 9i u hYoung Socialist league and the Young Labour League, a &quot;Unity of Youth&quot; Committee has been formed to promote a &quot;United Young People&apos;s Party&quot;.   The secretary is Nathan B. Whycor and the address that of the International Socialist Club.   Whyoer is, or was in 1920, secretary of the Jewish Socialist Labour Party, a voluntary worker for the &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; and editor of the &quot;Bed Flag&quot;, the organ of the Young Socialist League: this body reoently joined forces with the Proletarian Schools in Wales.On January 2nd about 850 young people attended a meeting of the Rochdale Socialist Sunday School, and were addressed on the subject &quot;Workers of the World Unite&quot;.   The Independent Labour Party in Leicester is starting a school which will probably be designated &quot;The Proletarian Sunday School -attached to the Third International.&quot;There is little doubt that this is a pernicious movement whioh will have serious effects unless counteracted: the Scouts&apos; organisation against which it is specially directed is therefore worthy of every encouragement.OTIEff RUSS14 MS, ^ &quot;Council fig ACTIOH&quot;Kr&amp;ssin recently made the following interesting commenf in a confidential report:   &quot;Here are many persons desirous waiting for another six months or a year to see whether the Soviet Government will not collapse of its own accord.   At the-same time I resolutely declare that there is no force in England at the present moment which could coerce the Government into concluding an agreement with us on, those conditions which we dictate.   The Council of Action has dried up entirelyI!   and in the next few months I fail to see anything that oan I   galvanize this corpse.&quot;It transpires that one&quot;of the recent JSnglisti visitors to Moscow gave Lanin a shock; when admitted to biB presence,he/
he was asked. &quot;What do you think of Lansbury?&quot;   and replied, &quot;Lansbury - Who is he??T   Lenin&apos;s jaw dropped, but unfortunately no further record of the conversation is available.THE INDSPEHDMT LABOUR PARTYThe Soottish divisional conference of the Independent Labour Party which met on January 3rd and 4th has declared, by 92 to 57 votes, against affiliation to the Third International, thus reversing the decision of last year.   Shinwell apparently led the moderates and asked if tho Reds were prepared to arm the ,..workers for armed revolution;   unless they were, they were not facing the realities involved in affiliation with Moscow.It seems probable that efforts will now be made, by the Labour Party and the Independent Labour Party, to establish some kind of all inclusive International.   A circular letter has been addressed to the Socialist and Communist parties of the world by the Sub-Committee of the Second International appointed by the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress.   It is signed by Arthur.....JBendarson. J, H. Thomas, Harry Gosling and Ramsay MacPonald anddefends the work of the Second International claiming that it &quot;has done quite as much as the Third (outside Russia itself) in ..   opposing capitalist and imperialist attacks on Russia.&quot;   The letter .pleads for a &quot;united International upon a more liberal basis than thfrk demanded by Moscow&quot;, one that will secure to each socialist group freedom to work in accordance v/ith its own means towards its socialist goal.LABOUR &apos;jM3jm CO-OPERATIVE MOVSMSflTOn January 1st the Co-operative.Wholesale Society, which maintains a Consistent campaign to atjt^act . the savings of the working class, announced that.it nowvhass.Jhe! current accounts of 4049 trade unions and friendly societies.   Deposits and withdrawalsof/
of the bank for the past year are stated to amount to  600,000,000.A majority of co-operators, however, seems averse to political activities; the most recent illustration of this fact comes from Leicester, where the Labour Party has been endeavouring to gain support for a contribution of one halfpenny per member per year to party funds: a ballot-of the 33,000 local co-operators resulted in 463 voting for end 667 again at the proposal. , ^In contrast to this astonishing apathy, however, the leaders of the respective movements are working hard for fusion.   The recent meeting between the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society, the Scottish Trades Union Congress and other Labour bodies was a most harmonious affair and the directors of the first named are to draft a soheme for a bank, presumably on lines similar to those on which the English Wholesale Bank is run.THE &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot; &quot; &apos;&apos;Confirmation of the view, repeatedly advanced in these - reports, that many trade unionists dislike and distrust the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, is furnished by the British Iron, Steel and Kindred Trades Association.   A recent ballot on a proposal &apos; to -contribute a shilling levy and a like sum from general funds for investment in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; resulted in 9,122 votes being cast for and 36,518 against the proposal.LABOUR AflD IRELANDOwing to the activities and to the report of the Labour&quot; \Commission, there is a revival of interest in Irish affairs.On December 28th the Commission issued a report in which theydeclared that &quot;We believe the evidence we hi-ve been able toobtain is more than sufficient to justify the strongestcondemnation/
dissenting from the &quot;view that the Government &quot;directly and definitely inspired reprisals and violence&quot; the Commission considered that it had brought into existence &quot;a new constabulary with its Auxiliary Division which was undisciplined and virtually uncontrolled&quot; and that &quot;the Government must take full responsibility for its own offspring.&quot;   The opinion was further stated that &quot;the Cork fires were caused by the Crown Forces.&quot;On December 29th these indictments were repeated in more violent form at a special conference of the Labour Party at the Carbon Hall, where some 800 delegates represented about 3J-million trade unionists and 47,000 members of socialist societies! Of the two resolutions passed the first called for a judicial enquiry into the question of reprisals, challenged the Governraenl tt disprove the statements of the Labour Commission by such an enquiry, and called for the punishment of offenders.   The second resolution condemned the outrages &quot;conducted in the name of Sinn Fein&quot;.   It supported  the view that a possible ground for a settlement in Ireland might be found in the withdrawal of all armed forces, the placing of the responsibility for the maintenance of order on the local authorities, and the immediate election of an entirely open constituent assembly free to frame aj Irish Constitution on any lines, provided that it safeguarded minorities and prevented Ireland becoming a military or naval menace to this country.   The conference, in the course of which several violent speeches were made, was addressed by Thomas Johnson, secretary of the Irish Labour Party.   A vigorous oarapai in support of the resolutions will be conducted throughout the country from January 17th to February 14th.   Members of the Commission have addressed meetings in various parts of the country and aroused a good deal of sympathy,SOT/condemnation of the policy of the British Government.&quot;   While
SIM F IN gj GREAT Britain there has been little outward movement in Sinn Fein circles but considerable play is being made with the assertion that the Black and Tans will be turned against the workers of this country in the event of labour troubles.   The Labour , Commission^ report has been well received and there is a revival of the hope that the British workers will in some way , assist Sinn Fein.Fenner Brockway, who is now closely connected with &quot;India&quot;, has written to the Irish Self-Deterr;ination League and asked to be supplied regularly with the &quot;Irish Bulletin&quot;.   He adds that he wants to be in close touch with Irish affairs and that the Indian National Congress has decided on a policy of non-co-operation with the British Government,   This statement is additional proof of the fact tnat the extremist sections of Labour are working for the disintegration of the Empire.On January 1st there was a small demonstration at Sheffield when nine Irishmen, who were said to have been &quot;victimised&quot; left for the United States ostensibly as &quot;missionaries&quot; for the &quot;Irish Republic&quot;. .The Kerthyr branch of the Irish Self-Determination League*has increased its membership by about sixty during the past month.   The League is active in Newcastle area and several miners1 lodges are passing resolutions calling upon the National Council of Action to take steps to compel the Government to withdraw the troops from Ireland.On January End a number of men were observed loitering in the neighbourhood of a large grain warehouse in Salford. Two of them were followed and questioned by a constable and one shot and wounded the officer, both men making good their escape.   As a result of this occurrence four men were arrested and have been remanded until January 11th.IRELAND/
- 12 - i*,IRELAND . there has been a considerable increase in crime during the past week.   The pronouncements of the clergy denouncing attacks on police have not had the slightest effect on the extreme section of the rebels.    In several Roman Catholic churches in Cork while the priest was reading the Bishop&apos;s decree the majority of the young men walked out of the church, In all there were 249 outrages committed as compared with 154 for the previous week.   Of these 140 were attributable to Sinn Fein.The munitions strike is settled and the Government has promised that there will be no &quot;victimisation&quot;.   The Labour element has gained prestige by the apparent ease with which it warded off penalties which might have been inflicted on the ringleaders.Martial law is driving the turbulent element from the proclaimed areas.The rumours as to the return of de Valera have created some mild excitement and speculations as to further political .moves.   The Royal Irish Constabulary have received instructio that the &quot;President of the Irish Republic&quot; is not to be interfered with if he is found in Ireland.   It is quite clear that the   men of the Forces are apprehensive that there will be a repetition of the policy of conciliation and release of the ruffians whom they have been active in arresting at the risk of their lives.   There is no doubt that de Ytlera would be running a great risk in returning to Ireland as there are many civilians who regard him as a traitor to Ireland and to the Republican cause.
