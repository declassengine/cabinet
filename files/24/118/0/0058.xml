PHIS DOCUMENT TS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVK.foMF.NT. 273 iE C R E T&quot; C a b n E T *C.P.2456.REPORT BY THE GENERAL OFFICER GOMJIANDING-IN-CHIEF ON THE SITUATION IN IRELAND FOR THE WEEK ENDING JANUARY 8th 1921.(Circulated to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for War)1. GENERAL SITUATION.,-The general situation does not show much change from the Military point of view; the rebel forces have been considerably more active than during the previous week -which was abnormally quiet.   This has been most narked in the martial law area where there have been several ambushes, and also in parts of Leinster and Ulster.   The increased activity may be due to the replace-ment of officers who have been arrested or are otherwise absent, a captured document shows that the Irish Republican Army HdvQrs. attach great importance to each commander having an understudy who can carry on in case of emergency.   The extremists are also doubtless anxious to display as much force as they can with a view to impressing the waverers and frustrating any efforts at a settlement which does not meet with their approval.   Further attempts at outrage may be expected and .f rom information received it seems that the period of comparative calm which  has lasted since Christmas has come to and end and.that there Is a propsect of guerilla warfare being intensified in the future.   The declaration of martial law in County Waterford will enable suitable steps to be taken to deal with the situation which has arisen in that County through the presence of many men on the run from, areas in which martial law had previously been declared It is reported that the punishments which have been inflicted-on certain localities in which outrages have been committed are having a great effect and may lead to information being given when ambushes etc* are being prepared.Somewhat extensive operations,, the object of which is not at present apparent, were carried out by the rebels in North West Kildare and South County Heath on the.night of Jan.8/9th. Towns were isolated, roads blocked and five bridges on.the River Liffey and Royal Canal were rendered impassable by.trenches and holes dug in them.   ThR only hostile action which resulted was the ambushing at Robinstown, County Heath, of a patrol from Navan which was sent to investigate and a demonstration against the police barrack at Longwood, County Heath.   After dispersing the ambushers the natrol visited Longwood and other villages and returned to Navan.There is no Incident to call for special mention in connec-tion with the Labour situation and no further difficulties have arisen on the Railways which are now practically normals   Some, raids for mails have occurred including three in two days in County Monaghan.
274Although some detachments have been withdrawn the scheme for tho concentration of the troops for the winter has not been fully put into operation curing to the necessity of maintaining the pressure on the rebel organizations.    Long dark nights, inoessant guard duties and constant patrolling in bad -weather, liable at any moment to ambush are a great strain on the young troops who f&amp;vrr- most cf these under1 my command.     The arrival of the new Battalions will to some extent relieve those who have done much hard work, but the aotual numorioal strength will not frftow much increase for some time Owing to drafts for abroad and the de-par ture of time expired men.    The increasing success of the troops in dealing with hostile activities, tho recent absence of regrettable incidents such as the disarming of guards without fighting and of unauthorised reprisals on the part of the army indicate teat despite all disadvantages their moral is high, which is borne out by their cheerfulness, and that their discipline and training are not suffering.    For this all commanders of formations, units and detachments and their staffs deserve great Credit.2. OPSBATIOKS.January &amp;aa. A civilian was wounded by a bayonet at Banger, County kayo, while attempting to take a rifle from a soldier on curfew patrol.January 4th. 1 officer and 10 other ranks in two Crosslay oars were ambushdd at Meelin near ilewmarket County Cork by a large party of i, rebels who had two machine guns.

An attack was attempted on the detachment guarding tho huts&quot; at Dollyrnount, Lublin.     The raiders were driven off and there was no casualties-January 7th,   The police barrack at Tramore, County eaterfrrd, was attacked&quot;at 2300 hours.     Troops going to their assistance &quot;rere ambushed about two miles from Tramoro.     The rebels wore dispersed leaving three dead, and 1 rifle, 8 revolvers, ammunition, and equip-mont were captured.     The attack on the police barrack was driven off. Our. casualties were 1 ether rank and 1 policeman wounded.3. SITUATION IH Uisra, In tho six County area in Ulster the for-mat ion&quot; of the specTal&quot; &quot;C ons tabular y is making substantial progress, and already some few detachments have boon withdrawn..     It is too early to say how soon it will be possible to reduce the number of units in this Area, but it is hoped that when the Constabulary organisation is complete and has gained some experience it may be possible to make some battalions available for service elsewhere in Ireland where they could be employed to great advantage in the present circumstances,4. DISTRIBUTION OP HOOPS. The arrival of the extra Battalions has enabled certain readjustments to be made in the location of units. The 1st, Royal Fusiliers has been transferred to the Kerry Brigade and has relieved the 2nd, Bn. Uast Lancashire Regiment at Killamey and taken over most of its detachments,     The latter regiment, whioh for a long time has been widely distributed in County JCorry, is now almost entirely concentrated at Eati-*va&quot;at, its per man one station. This should prove greatly to its advance in discipline and train-ing both of which suffered to some oxte-ic in its previous stations. Certain other changes which hod been intended have not been found possible owing to the weakness of both existing and reinforcing battalions.     I attach as en appendix a statement showing the allot-nent of Battalions to Brigades as it will exist on the arrival of the last reinforcing battalion.     The only alteration at present under contemplation is an-exchange between the 2nd.Bn,, The Green Howards, 18th.. Infantry Brigade, Hathkoaio and the lst.Bn. JJoyal Warwick-shire Hegt. 17th.. Infantry Brigade, Tipperary.5. IHTB^MilUT OF CFjggigg 0?
