The substitution of a 33 per cent and valorem tariff for a system of prohibition and licence seems to me to raise far-reaching issues which the Cabinet ought carefully to consider. I am convinced that the change of method will raise large questions of a political character and will revive controversy which ought not to have any relation to the difficulties with which we are now confronted.
