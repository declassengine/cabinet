The &quot;Dally Herald&quot; is doing its utmost to provoke unconstitutional methods, happily so far without success The Labour Party Executive and the Parliamentary Committee are wording very hard and a national conference is to he held on January 27 th.   There have been slight indications in various parts of the country of a tendency quietly to accept lower wages at the instance of the local Trade Union secretary, with a view to relieving their funds of unemployed members.Details are given of a movement by the &quot;Red&quot; International of Trade Unions, which is probably financed by Russia:   a conflict with the International Federation of Trade Unions will almost inevitably follow.An important secret Bolshevik conference was held in Germany at the end of December,   Quotations are given from the report made on Cozmminism in Great Britain and Ireland, which Is of exceptional interest.There is growing unrest among the miners:   the Unofficial reform movement has spread to Northumberland and Durham but has not yet gained any great hold in those Counties.Tho rift in the Independent Labour Party grows wider and the Left Wing seems likely to join forces with the Communists.It is announoed that the Labour party&apos;s &quot;Peace with Ireland&quot; campaign will start in England, Scotland and Wales on January 17th, and that on February 5th the campaign will betransferred/
transferred to-London, concluding with a meeting at the Albert Hall on February 15th. jMr * Majone has been trying to make terms with the Government to avoid, imprisonment:   his appeal will-.be heard . to-morrow (Friday).Krassin left for Berlin on Monday, partly to confer with Lomonovicv, who is suspected of an intention to supplant him, and partly to confer with Xrupp about the repair of Russian locomotives.The recent removal to Ireland for internment of leading Sinn Seiners in Lancashire has had a very sobering effect.
UNS1IPL0YMEHT ------       jA further increase in unemployment- is reported; on December 30th the figures for Lancashire and. Cheshire wero, &quot;totally unemployed 78,052, workers on short time 250,84-1; in -&apos;*   Glasgow about&apos; 25,000 are unemployed and 7,000 on short time; in the Nottingham district the unemployed number 15,000, md in Xeicestor 14,000.   Reports from the provinces contain little new matter but express fear of further trade depression and distress; opposition to the short time scheme is gaining ground.A serious factor in the situation is the growth of class hatred: the assertions that unemployment is &quot;part of the capitalist system&quot; and part of a scheme on the part of the employers to force a reduction in wages find more supporters daily; various alarming rumours are being circulated, as, for instance, that 60,000 railwayman are shortly to be dismissed.There have been no important seizures of buildings, but extremist orators are dealing almost exclusively with unemployment.On January 11th the Parliamentary Committee of the Traces Union Congress and the Executive Committee of. the Labour Party&apos; *   decided in conference at the Central Rail, Westminster, to reject - the short-time scheme and declined to take part in a Government enquiry on unemployment, even on.the amended terms of reference. The conference regretted &quot;that the Government has disregarded &apos; 11 warnings &apos;;and failed to give timely effect to the preventive and. remedial measures suggested by the successive national and.......inter-allied Labour conferences during 1917, 1918, and- 1919;aM even the Jo in t Industrial Conference of,.1919, which was summoned by the Government itself, with an undertaking that its findings would be embodied in,immediate legislation.&quot;&apos; It decided to appoint its own committee to formulate practical ;.b cherries for securing immediate relief for those now unemployed, and definite proposals/
proposals for dealing with the whole problem as one of national urgency, such schemes and proposals to be submitted    ( ^ for consideration and endorsement to a special joint national conference of the trade union movement and the Labour party      I on January 27th, 1921.   The conference further referred the resolution passed at the special Labour Congress on December     I 29th, &quot;together with the proposals already named, to the committee now to be appointed, for elaboration into a definite   I programme and policy, to be commended to the Labour movement for such action as it may deem neoessary, and to be pressedIupon the Government, and, unless action is immediately taken , at the beginning of the session, upon the House of Commons.&quot; , .       Although the. &quot;Daily Herald&quot; loudly proclaims that , &quot;ACTION&quot; will be the result of the conference of January 27th, there is at present little indication of departure from constitutional measures.   The mischievous activity of the paper, as set forth in the following paragraph, is, however, worthy of attention:&quot;The unemployed are out of work through no fault of their own, but through the operations of the capitalist system.   They are half-starving because the Government provisions for meeting unemployment are insultingly and degradingly insufficient.   What they need is decent maintenance until work sohemes have been set going; and those sohemes depend on two further things - the provision of money by the Government and the opening up of markets with Russia and Central Surope.   All this Labour has olearly explained and emphatically declared for.   All thie the Government refuses to do.    Labour, however, can intimidate the Government, if it is sufficiently united a;p&amp; sufficiently decideft.&quot;At present it seems improbable that any call for &apos;Direot Action&quot; in the form of a general strike would evoke much response for the men still working are intent upon &quot;keeping their ,1obB.&quot;COMMUMSM Iir GREAT BRITAIN AND IR&amp;LMLv  A report on the Communist movement in Great Britain and Ireland of quite exceptional interest was made at a Bolshevikconference/
conference in the Harz mountains on December 25th and 27th:it gave not only a resume of the revolutionary situation, hutdetails of the expenditure of Russian money for propaganda purposes,   Among those present were the leaders of Bolshevik propaganda for Western Europe and representatives of Easternpropaganda bureaux from Moscow and -Berlin.The English delegate, who want under an assumed name,announced that from the point of view of the Third International,the situation in England might be described as &quot;hopeless&quot; ...&quot;The semi-bourgeois character of the English proletariat servesas a kind of bulwark for England and tne English bourgeois&apos;Government.&quot;&quot;Prom the point of view of strength, the most influential organisation in South Wales is the Cardiff group.   They are in possession of an excellent printing-press where books and pamphlets are typed, and there is an excellent liaison all over the area of the mountain districts.   There is also any amount of funds, which has made it possible to increase propaganda to its present high standard.   Next to Cardiff, Plymouth ranks &amp;s a centre for naval and maritime organisations.   Owing to the exoellent organisation of the British Police, a Technical  * Centre could not be established in Plymouth itself, but it remains important as a centre of communication with France and America.   Birmingham and Manchester are necessary as&apos; centres of proletarian political life.   Due . attention has been paid to them, and Litnchester at present is a sort of Communist Mecca for England, a meeting place for the best and most promising forces.&quot;Our expenses for the organising and propaganda centres were  23,750 monthly, not including the extraordinary expenses incurred by the Commercial Commission. I reported immediately, via London, as to the necessity of doubling this amount up to  50,000 monthly, but the routine work and indecision of the London.office obstructs our work, and I propose to the present Conference to insist, for the benefit of the Cause, on the necessity of estab-lishing a fund quite independent of the Diplomatic Centre whence we can obtain means without being obstructed by the ever-increasing office formalities.&quot;At present, in the whole of England, 79 Communist District organisations are at work, divided into 26 1arrondissementsT,   Each arrondissement should have one printing-press.   This involves a fresh allotment of funds. The number of active members of the Communist nuclei in England are not more than 20,000, but those who are in favour of Communism are five times that numberPaid/
Paid agents of the first class: 172 Paid agents of the second class: 430 Paid agents of the third class:    617&quot;Lack of funds for extraordinary expenses prevented the extension of the net of agitation in Ireland at the mosont when financial support would have been of incredible value - the recent riots in Cork., &quot;In future one can reckon only on the work of the secret organisations, as it must be obvious to everyone of us that diplomatic representation in England will not last long.&quot;The &quot;London Office&quot; is, of course, the Russian Trading Delegation.Conditions in Scotland and Ireland were reported to be &quot;slightly better&quot; than in England, Edinburgh, being mentioned as having done &quot;fine organising work&quot; and having supplied &quot;a number of useful workers&quot;.   &quot;Ireland could become a firm base for communism in view of its economic condition and the revolutionary spirit existing in the masses.   Mistakes were made from the very beginning when Moscow established liaison with the Sinn Fein Government.   Mistakes and the tactless behaviour of Kerschenzeff alienated Irish leaders from the Central Executive Committee of the Third International and made them hostile to all our enterprises.&quot;By ?/ay of comment on the Russian Trading Delegation, the report added that progress was much more rapid in France where &quot;there is no Soviet mission&quot; and &quot;a thorough under-standing of the French proletariat was of enormous help to us: that is w&amp;y we lost so much as far as England is concerned -that is.why instructions from the Centre were successful in France and a failure in England.&quot;   The fact that the Bolshevik even now have not a clear understanding of the British proletariat emerges from the concluding paragraph:   &quot;I believe that the revolution of the French people cannot be avoided, a that the red sky in Prance will warm the cold Tiritons and tha the Iviay sun will shine on the present slaves of capital as th masters.&quot;   , THE/
The dispute between the &quot;Red&quot; International of TradeUnions and the orthodox International federation of TradeUnions has had an important development: a &apos;british Bureau&quot; ofthe former has been formed, consisting of:Tom Mann, Robert Williams,A, A, Pure ell,B. Williams, I. Bell,S. Kay,J. T. Murphy,&quot;E.B.&quot;E. Lismer (Organising Secretary) George Peet (Corresponding Secretary).The Provisional &quot;International Council of Labour Unions&quot;, thename given to this &quot;Red&quot; International, consists inter aliosof M6 Tomsky, A.Rosmer and J. T. Murphy, and has issued amanifesto &quot;To the organised workers of Great Britain.&quot;$early half of this is devoted to an attack upon theInternational Federation of Trade Unions and its leaders:&quot;The leaders of the Amsterdam International stand condemned as leaders of the working class.   They have preached peace where there can be no peace.   They have turned to the capitalist International and scorned the Workers&apos; International.   Prom such leadership we must turn av/ay.   Such an international we must destroy.nThe manifesto then proceeds to define the &quot;Red&quot; International:&quot;We must sweep away the reactionary leaders.   We must create means for immediate action, and an International of the Labour Unions which shall line, up with the Communist; International and express international working class solidarity in deeds worthy of the task history calls upon us to perform.   This International must be an International of the Masses and not merely an international of trade union bureaucrats.... r*v &quot;For theBe purposes the revolutionary workers of every union must carry on in every union branch, in every workshop, mill and mine, an intense agitation against all forms of reaction, and bitterly oppose the propaganda and :policy of class peace, which always leaves the workers &apos; &quot;victims to the capitalists.   We must create extra-union &apos; 1 organisations such as Shop Stewards and Workers&apos; Committees in the factories, Pit Committees in the mines, Vigilance Committees in the unions, in order to battle with the defects of the unions; to remove reactionary leaders from office, and to have a means of action independent of them in hours of crisis.   We must explain to our fellow-workers that time and again, so long; as the reactionary leaders maintain their connection with the Labour Unions, crises will arise when these leaders will be thrust into action.     .       -alongside/
)alongside the revolutionary workers and appear to he revolutionists, as in the crisis when British Imperialie was about to declare open war on The Russian workers. We must explain that they are there for wholly different reasons and for totally different objectives than those of the revolutionary workers.   Then they spoke with the voice of the petty shop-keeper against the aggression of the big capitalists and their action coincided with the action of the revolutionary workers who are against all capitalists.   Therein lies danger of their betrayal. We&quot; must persuade our fellow-workers to breakaway their organisations from the &quot;yellow&quot; Amsterdam International and join them to the &quot;Red&quot; Labour Union International that will maroh with the Communist International against all the enemies of the working class.&quot;The &quot;Red&quot; Labour Union International is now in process of formation, and the jnoment is opportune for the immediate action of every worker who is tired of thi reactionaries, for every worker who is anxious to march! out of the deadlock of human relations into whioh humanity has drifted.   All the delegates from the Industrial organisations represented at the Seoond Worll Congress of the Communist International agreed with the Congress that the time had arrived for a new alignment I the labour unions of the world, that just as history challenged the revolutionary,workers to destroy the Sec i International and form a new &quot;International Communist Party, so history is challenging, the revolutionary worl to destroy the Amsterdam International, led by similar! people guilty of similar traitorous acts, and create a I new Labour Union International under new leadership,   f governed by principles in accord with the historic     I purpose of the Working Class. .&quot;The delegates of the following industrial ;,      I organisations, * V;.o    IAll-Russian Trade Unions, , &quot;.Bulgarian Central Council of Trade Unions, I General Confederation of Yugo Slavia, I&quot;The Syndicalists of Italy,   . &apos; IThe Italian Confederation of Labour, ,      j; The Spanish Syndicalists, . &apos;...    f;Social Revolutionary Unions of Germany, 11Transport Workers of Holland, ,,JFederation of Transport &quot;Workers of Dutch E.&quot; Indi I Regional Federation&apos;;of Labour,   Argentina,,; , Minority Section of ,the French Confed. ofLabonf h Azerbaijan Council, of Trade Unions,    -I.W.W. of America, I.W.W, of Australia, , - British Shop Stewards and Workers&apos; Committees,&apos; Norwegian Industrial Unions, Trade Union Council of the Furthest Bast,have therefore formed the Provisional International Council of Labour Unions, and elected a provisional Executive Committee. This Committee they have instructed to oonvene a World Congress of all the sS Labour/
Labour Union Organisations unconnected with or prepared to sever their connection with the &quot;yellow&quot; &amp;nsterdam International, and to consciously wage the class struggle in accord with the Communist International.&quot;The orovisional Executive Committee accordingly invites every industrial organisation, whether Trade Union or Industrial Union, National Shop Stewards&apos; - Committee.or Trade Union Federation, to elect delegates to the World Congress of Labour union Organisations oonvened for May 1st, 1921, in Moscow.&quot;Two resolutions, whioh are to be put before all trade union branches, are aopended to the manifesto; the first calls upon the executive of the trade union oonoerned to take all necessary steps, to secure the proper election of delegates to the World Congress of Labour Unions in Moscow on May let, pledged to support &quot;a revolutionary policy aiming at the world wide dictatorship of the proletariat&quot; and affiliation to the &quot;Red&quot; International of Trade Unions. The second calls upon the executives to eever all connection with the Amsterdam Federation of Trade Unions and to take steps to obtain the withdrawal of the Trades Union Congress from that organisation.This movement is of considerable importance and there are indications that it is financed from Russian sources: it is significant that Lismer, the organising secretary, settled an outstanding account for  140*, when ordering 150,000 oopies of the manifesto; he added, &quot;The money is being advanced so that we can get on with our work.&quot;It sooras desirable that this movement should be brought, to the attention of the International Federation of Trade Unions without delay, as Williams, Purcell and Mann are trade union officials of some importance.   Stejps are being taken to that end.THE/
THE COMMUNISTSCommunist activity, at the moment, is divided into two sections: the leaders are. endeavouring to find some kind of common platform which will enable a &quot;united&quot; communist party to be formed, at least on paper, at Leeds on January 29th and 30th, while the speakers and the rank and file are devoting their energies to the exploitation of unemployment.In Birmingham, the extremists are muoh conoerned about recent arrests of communist speakers and tho Independent Labour Party, Herald League, &quot;Hands off Russia&apos;&apos; Committee and .local Communist Parties have formed a &quot;Free Speech Committee&quot; with the object of creating a large fund to fight &quot;all attacks on the principle of free speech.&quot;   These people hold that speeches are tha best kind of propaganda,   Harvey and Steele have appealed against their recent sentences: the appeal was dismissed, but tho Recorder ruled that hard labour was not appropriate to the case and reduced Steals1s sentence to one of three months imprisonment.   Defendants counsel pressed for a definition of sedition, claiming that it was only defined by a jury under the direction of a judge and that never before in the history of tm had sedition been a matter which could be defined by a oourt of summary jurisdiction: it was ultra vires of the Act of Parliameu to create an offence.Tanner&apos;s Bolshevik propaganda pictures and posters, to the number of 480, were shown in the Independent Labour,Party   1 rooms at Coventry on January 4th, 5th and 6th.   The cost of the I exhibition was about  8, but the collections each night did not exceed 30s.   In addition to this loss, the organiser complained to my correspondent that many of the &quot;comrades&quot; had added insuli to injury by putting bad money and buttons in the collections.The sentence on Sylvia Pankhurst has been confiimed and a demonstration/
demonstration of some sixty people assembled outside Holloway prison to cheer and serenade her with the &quot;Red Flag&quot;.   It was announced that further demonstrations would be held and that efforts would be made to secure a band.MR. gfigffi, M.P.Maione&apos;s appeal against his conviction is to be heard on Friday the 14th.   Yesterday his solicitor called to say that Maione was very much averse to going to prison and would be prepared to give a,verbal undertaking to exercise a restraining influence on the Communists if the Prosecution would consent to an adjournment till next Sessions, with a view to his being bound over.   The solicitor said that Sfolone was thoroughly disillusionised with Communism but that he could not yet break : : with the Party nor allow to be published any recantation on his .   part.. The solicitor was informed that there could be no interference with the ordinary course of justice.BOLSHEVISM IN THE UNIVERSITIES&quot;Parlour&quot; Bolshevism is making some headway among the under-graduates of both Universities.   Speaking at Cambridge, an under-graduate referred warmly to-the visit of George Lansbury to Eton ,. . . under the auspices of the Bead Master.   A Balliol undergraduate who took Second Class honours, one T. Wintringham, is now emplo,Vod in the Foreign Office at Moscow, having gone to Russia primarily to report upon his father&apos;s interests in a timber concession and having stayed on as an adventure.   Besides young Andrew Eothstein, who has now left the University, it appears that another under-graduate, E. M. Higgins, is affected by Bolshevism and is acting as a propagandist among the undergraduates.An undergraduate named C W. Brook is secretary of theCambridge/
Cambridge branch of the Communist Party of Great Britain and ofthe Cambridge University Socialist Society: the membership of the former is about twelve, but the sympathisers number considerably more.   There are nineteen college secretaries of the Cambridge University Socialist Society.Study Clubland the Cambridge University Labour Club, of which Mr. Clynes, M.P. is ^resident, appears to be well organised.The leader of the communists at Cambridge was recently &quot;raided&quot; by some fellow undergraduates in masks, who informed him that they were Sinn Peiners who wished to ascertain if he wore &quot;true to the Cause&quot;.TBg RUSSIAN TRADING DELEGATIONErassin left on Monday for Berlin, where he hopes to meet Lomonossov and come to an understanding.   It appears that Lomonossov has become the personal agent of Litvinoff, who has acquired great influence in Moscow, and he has refused any longer to take orders from Krassin.   A second reason for the visit to Berlin is Krassin&apos;s scheme for effecting a co-operation between Messrs. Vickers and Erupp to induce them to accept a ; concession of a factory in South Russia for the repair of Russia:;.. locomotives.   They are to employ Russian workmen who are not onl;-.. to be paid, 33y the Soviet. Government, but are to be allowed to accept a &quot;bonus&quot; from the Syndicate.   A co-operation between Vickers and Krupp. is practically certain, but not necessarily for Erassin&apos;s scheme..Re is also trying to float a large concession of land in South Russia to Germans for agriculture on similar terms.GERMAN HEAVY INDUSTRIALS IN MGLANDPour of the&quot;heavy industrials&quot;, headed by Deutsche, are in England until Saturday in consultation with capitalists here on
a scheme for stabilising the exchange between the two countries and ior oo-operation in trade matters.THE IflDSPSNBEBT LABO Pit PAINTYThe rift in the Independent Labour Party grows wider, as the proposed policy comes up for discussion in the local branches: those members who have been to Russia, particularly W, Paul (who is also on the executive of the Communist Party of Great Britain) and Mrs. Helen Crawfurd are working hard to consolidate the Left Wing with the object of capturing the party machinery or of effecting fusion with the United Communist Party.On January 8th the Left Wing held a conference at Merborough at which a determined onslaught was made on the Snowden group, who are accused of being- in the pay of the &quot;cocoa money bags&apos;&apos;&apos;.   A resolution was passed pledging the conference to work for communism inside the Independent Labour Party until the annual conference, and after that date to consider the position in consultation with the United Communist Party &apos;Tfor the purpose of ascertaining the future of the Independent Labour Party Left Wing and its work for the world communist party&quot;.The fury of the communists with firs. Snowdenrs book on Russia is a testimony to its value: Philip Snowdan has severed his connection with the &quot;Labour Leader&quot;.TIP COAL HI-U5RSThere is evidenoe of unrest among the miners who seem to anticipate an effort to reduce their wages.   Short time is being discussed at some pits and the men claim that this will -  be the result of over-production.The extremists, however, are alive to their opportunity and/
and the unofficial reform committees show signs of abnorma activity: a lengthy men ifesto has been issued from the headquarters in Rhondda Fawr.   This document appears to be in the main, an attack on the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation but it is hoped to obtain a copy shortly.In Scotland also the &quot;rebel&quot; movement is making progress: on January 3rd about 300 delegates from Lanarkshire, Fifeshire, Stirlingshire, 3ast and West Lothians, Ayrshire and Dumbartonshire attended a meeting at the headquarters of the Socialist Labour Party in Glasgow.   A man named Jordon, of Blantyre, took the chair and the matters considered were:-   One raining union for Scotland, the new wages agreement, five day week and six hour day, miners&apos; agents, election of officials.   It was unanimously decided to proceed with the formation of one Scottish Union of Mine Workers.   Jordon was elected president, W. C, Kirker, of Bowhill, a member of the Fife Communist Group, was appointed secretary, and Rafferty and Hugh McEerrell treasurers.   The conference decided to divide Scotland into 10 areas for purposes of representatit Two delegates from each district were to be nominated to the Central Board for administrative purposes, and the constitution was to bo practically identical with that of the extremist miners in South %les in so far as those rules can be. applied to Scotland.   A committee of 12 msrabel was appointed to draft rules for submission to the confers! on February 14th.   It was decided to press for the five dsj week and the six hour day and to continue propaganda for this end among the county unions.   It was agreed that mine! agents should be elected by ballot for one year only but tlthey/ T
they should he eligible for re-election.The attention of the South -Wales and Scottish extremists is now being turned to Northumberland, end Durham and a conferenceBall, Birtley, on January 8th.   The meeting was secitet, hut cannot be considered representative as only twelve lodges in Durham and two in Northumberland sent delegates.   The objects were declared to be reorganisation on the lines of industrial unionism, the abolition of capitalism and the substitution of communism, a five day week, six hours day, resistance to the reduction of wages either locally or nationally, and the abolition of all piece work.   While this movement will need careful observation, it is not at the moment widespread in the North Eastern coalfields, for after the recent coal strike, a resolution of &quot;no confidence&quot; in the local trade union officials was rejected in Durham by about 50 to 1.SINN FEIN IN GREAT BRITAIN ,  .   .Little activity has been apparent during the week among Sinn Feiners in England, but 150 members were present at a meeting of the Irish Labour Party in Glasgow on January 9th. The following officers were elected:of the unofficial reform movement was held at the Go-operativePresident: Vice-President:John Maguire, Robert MoGinnis, Thomas NolaU-Walshe,See*:e&apos;:acy: Tr^e.&apos;jurer:Robert Mone, Frank Duffy,Orgaul-i ing Se c retary: Press Agent:Seamus Mo Shane.Committee:John Rerrity,Owen McManus, John Byrne, Tbor&amp;G J, Murray,John Rogers, John McWee.Seven of the most dangerous Sinn Feiners in Lancashire
have been removed to Ireland for internment under the Restoration of Order in Ireland Regulations.   The news of this action on the part of the Government has had a very sobering effect upon the English Sinn Feiners throughout the country,ireland there is no material cfeange to report in the state of the provinces during the week.   148 outrages were committed.   It is noteworthy that some of the most serious crimes occurred in ulster in the Counties of Monaghan and Armagh: of the total number of outrages 127 were attributable to Sinn Fein.Information hts been received that Michael Collins, G.O.C., Irish Republican Army, has refused to have anything to do with the deputation to Downing Street, but on the contrary has issued orders to his commanders to mobilise and increase their activity within the next few days.   In this connection also, it is reported that all the members of the Irish Republican Army in Derry City attended Mass this week snd received Communion - a procedure which is generally regarded as a preliminary to serious activity.   It is believed that Collins will make some desperate effort to overawe those who, he thinks, are wavering and * desirous of peace.The Sinn Fein papers appeared as usual.   Both &quot;Old Ireland&quot; and &quot;Young Ireland&quot; devote much of their space to the discussion of England!s financial and economic difficulties.   &quot;Old Ireland&quot; prints what purports to be an extract from a report made by General Sir Henry Lawson on the Irish Republican Army to the Peace with Ireland Committee.   This report, or alleged report, palliates the murders of members of the Crown Forces, and implies that they were necessary as it was impossible for the irish republican/
Republican Army to &quot;take and keep as prisoners those whose continued osistenco threatened the oause and livos of the Irish Republican Army&quot;.   A reference is also m&amp;de to de Yalera&apos;s disappearance from America.   &quot;Old Ireland&quot; refuses to forecast de Valera&apos;s plans, but says, &quot;If he is in Ireland his presence will rapidly make itself felt.&quot;   It doubts very much whether his coming can be interpreted as a sign of coming peace, as &quot;Peace is no longer in the air.&quot;There is strong reason for believing that de Valera is in Ireland and is in conference with Father 0&apos;Flanagan.A copy of the &quot;Irish Bulletin&quot;, translated into French, has come into our hands.   It is being widely circulated among continental journalists from Paris.
