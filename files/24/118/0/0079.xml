22.1.21,08PART I-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.The general industrial situation continues to be quiet. Trouble has arisen at Ilford, however, over the refusal of the Urban District Council to concede, in their entirety, to the members of the Electrical Power Engineers&apos; Association in their employment, the terms embodied in the schedule of salaries and conditions of service recommended by the National Joint Board of Employers and Staff Members in the electricity supply industry, although the majority of electricity undertakings in the country have now done so. As a result of this refusal, the engineers have ceased work, and the town has been deprived of electric power and light since the evening of the 13th January. The Minister, however, has intervened, and there is every prospect of an early settlement. The Engineers have received the active support of the members of the local branch of the Municipal Employees&apos; Association, who have taken advantage of the situation to press their own demands for the application to the clerical staffs of the Civil Service war bonus, and with regard to certain grievances of the manual workers. The strike is of some special interest, in view of the fact that the -members of the Electrical Power Engineers&apos; Association are well-paid, salaried and technical workers.Arising out of the strike of the shipyard joiners, which still continues, the members of tbe Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers have decided by 27,569 votes to 8,103 in favour of a levy in support of the strikers, varying from 4s. a week in the case of men receiving 2s. id. per hour, to 2s. per week in the case of men receiving less than 2s. per hour. It is also announced that the Clyde District Committee of the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades have decided to ballot their members on the question of a levy in support of the shipyard joiners.The unemployment situation becomes steadily worse, and the number of unemployed persons continues to increase. The opposition to the Governmenfs short-time proposals does not diminish, the proposal to introduce short-time working into the Government dockyards having been strongly condemned by the employees concerned. The question of short-time working on the railways has alro been discussed, and the executive com-mittee of the National Union of Pailwaymen issued a statement on the 13th January alleging that the introduction of this arrangement on the railways would result in placing large numbers of members of the union below the poverty line, and would also be a viola-tion of the principle of the &quot; guaranteed week.&quot; The Scottish Trade Union Congress, at a special meeting held in Glasgow on. the 15th, also criticised the Governmenfs proposals severely, and demanded full maintenance for unemployed workers, resumption of trade with Russia, and the distribution of food through the local authorities.The Labour Gazette cost-of-living index number for the 1st January was 165, as compared with 169 on the 1st December and 176 on the 1st November. The decline during the month was mainly due to reductions in the prices of several of the principal articles of food, for example, flour and bread, bacon, margarine and butter, sugar, tea, eggs and potatoes, and in the price of clothing. It will be seen that the figure, after having risen steadily, except during the year 1919, since the end of 1914, now appears to be on the decline.The Unemployment Position.Statistics.-Th.e number of H.M. Forces and merchant seamen out-of-work donation policies lodged in the United Kingdom on the 7th January was 287,909, comprising 287,380 for men and 529 for women. In addition, there were 10,870 policies lodged by short-time workers, 10,855 for men and 15 for women. On the 31st December there were 264,598 policies lodged, 264,106 by men and 492 by women. On the same date there were 11,338 policies lodged by short-time workers, 11,318 for men and 20 by women.
On the 7th January in the United Kingdom 503,892 unemployment books, 280,084 for males and 223,808 for females, remained lodged under the Unemployment Insurance Act. Compared with the previous week, when there were 242,998 lodged by males and 171,349 by females, the increase is 89,545. In addition, there were 459,955 books lodged by short-time workers, 182,828 by males and 277,127 by females, an increase on the previous week of 24,803.The fi figures for the 7tli January are subject to revision.The total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 7th January was 855,526. A full analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 85.FEATURES OF THE WEEK.General Topics.Wage Reductions. The general effect of the present depression of trade on collective bargaining may be said to have been to strengthen the employers&apos; case, while weakening the economic strength of trade union organisation, with the result that wage reductions are either in operation or in contemplation in a number of cases. From the information to hand, however, it would be rash to infer the existence of any general policy along these lines among employers. .More significant of the trend of present developments than the majority of instances of wage reductions reported, was the recent decision of the Federa-tion of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades to postpone for six months the pressing of their wages programmedThe decline in the cost of living will necessarily be reflected in a reduction of wages in those industries, such as the railway industry, where the payment of wages is governed, partly at any rate, by cost-of-living sliding scales, while the weakening of prices will similarly affect the wage earners in industries, as, for example, some sections of the iron and steel trades, which follow a sliding scale based on the selling price of the product.The first large instance of the putting into operation of proposals for a wage reduction was that of the shipyard joiners, who are still on strike against the withdrawal of the 12s. bonus, but the circumstances of this dispute, which have already been discussed in this Eeport,f are special and peculiar. The non-compliance of the West of Scotland Manufacturers&apos; Association with Award No. 422 of the Industrial Court has produced a situation which is still unsettled.^ The building trade is threatened with notices of serious reductions, but these proposals should probably not be regarded as a direct challenge to the operatives&apos; demands, hut rather as a manoeuvre for the stabilisation of conditions. There have been sporadic instances of wage reductions among unskilled and semi-skilled workers. For example, in various localities in the Yorkshire area the rates paid for labourers engaged in navvying have been reduced apparently without a struggle. This may be partially explained by the fact that in one or two instances the rates in question were building trade rates obtained in a time of abnormal labour scarcity. In the South Wales area, which, in consequence of the localised condition of its industries, is an area to itself, the new sliding scale now in operation in the tinplate trade has resulted in reductions for process workers. Since this industry occupies a cardinal position in the South Wales system of wage standards, developments must be expected in other industries. At the moment, proposals for the reduction of wages for non-process workers in the tinplate industry and for operatives in the copper trade are under consideration.Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920.-The National Federation of Employees&apos; Approved Societies, which consist of societies approved under the Health Insurance Acts and formed in connection with commercial and industrial undertakings, have been in negotiation with the Ministry of Labour, on behalf of the affiliated societies, concerning the administration of unemployment insurance benefit under Section 17 of the Unemploy-ment Insurance Act. A model form of &quot; arrangement &quot; has been agreed upon, and appli-cations from three or four of the individual societies have already been approved.* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 26, 25th December, p. 702.f See this Report, Vol. II, No. 23, 4th December, p    34,% See this Report, Vol. II, No. 24, 11th December, p. 658, and p. 73 below.(B 16873T) I 2The General Situation-continued,
To enable them to carry out the requirements of Section 17 with regard to the notification of vacancies, the societies have sought the assistance of the Chambers of Commerce, and it is reported that the majority of these bodies are willing to make the following arrangements : (l) The Chamber will arrange to far as practicable to obtain from employers of labour notification of vacancies to be filled from time to time.(2) The Chamber will communicate such information promptly to societies conducting unemploy-ment insurance business within the district covered by that particular Chamber.It is stated that this system is intended to be supplementary to, and not in substitution of, any existing system of filling vacancies, which employers may find convenient.Housing. The Minister of Health has appointed a committee &quot; to inquire and report as to the reasons for the present high cost of building working-class dwellings, and to make recommendations as to any practicable measures for reducing the cost.&quot; The personnel of the committee is as follows: Mr. J. Stanley Holmes, M.P., L.C.C., chair-man ; Sir Thomas Robinson, M.P. ; Colonel J. Ward, M.P.; Sir James Carmichaei; Mr. Thomas Barron; Mr. A. G. Cross, F.S.I.; Mr. F. G. Gayer, F.I.O.B.; Mr. James Gibson; *Mr. A. W. Jenldnson ; Mr. W. H. Nicholls; Mr. B. H. Selby; Mr. J. Walker Smith; and Mr. S. Stranks. Mr. T. H. Sheepshanks, of the Ministry of Health, will act as secretary. The address of the committee is the Ministry of Health, Whitehall, S.W.I.Colonel Ward, M.P., is intended to represent the general interests of labour on the committee, [and Mr. Barron, Mr. Gayer and Mr. Stranks were nominated by the Resettlement Committee of the Building Trades Joint Industrial Council to represent the operatives.   Mr. Nicholls represents the National Federation of Building Trades Employers.Board of Education: Salaries of Elementary School Teachers.-k report has been issued by the executive council of the National Association of SchooImasters* on the findings of the Burnham Committee, the report of the Select Committee on National Expenditure last yearf on the Board of Education and the letter of the 24th December from the President of the Board of Education to Lord Burnham4 It is stated in the report that the small increases in salary granted to teachers since 1914, and the advances contemplated in the Burnham Report, are insufficient to maintain even the pre-war standard of living. If the Board of Education delay or fail to put into operation the Burnham scales, the association will regard such action as a breach of faith, calculated to involve serious consequences. Mr. Fisher&apos;s attitude to the Burnham Committee&apos;s recom-mendations is criticised on the ground that he shows an &quot; inclination to surrender to the unreal&apos; economy in education &apos; cry,&quot; and holds that the standard scales of pay should be regarded as the maximum rates. The dangers of discontent and active unrest among the members of the teaching profession are pointed out, and the report closes with, the statement that an efficient educational system is vital to national progress and can only be secured by a contented teaching service.Labour and Ireland. The 17th January marked the beginning of the Labour cam-paign to promote peace with Ireland. Meetings were held on that date at Manchester, Glasgow and Cardiff. The chairman at the meeting held in the Free Trade Hall, Man-chester, was Mr. A. G. Cameron and the speakers were Messrs. Arthur Henderson, J. R. Clynes, Ben Tillett, Arthur Greenwood and Miss Margaret Bondneld. The policy of the Labour Party with regard to Ireland was outlined, and the experiences of the Labour Commission of Inquiry were described.At the meeting in St. Andrews Hall, Glasgow, the speakers were Messrs. John Lawson, M.P., and W. Adamson, M.P., who declared that Ireland could never be repressed by force of arms, and that the Irish leaders had shown clearly that they would only negotiate as equals. Mr. J. H. Thomas and Brigadier-General Thomson were the chief speakers at the meeting held in Cardiff. A resolution was passed calling for the withdrawal of armed forces from Ireland and an immediate judicial inquiry into the outrages and reprisals.It is reported that an open letter has been addressed by the National Executive of the Irish Labour Party and Trades Union Congress to the workers of Great Britain, urging that immediate action should betaken to bring about the &quot; cessation of hostilities.&quot;* This association was formed at the time of the last annual conference of the National. Union of Teachers, to protest against the adoption by the union of the policy of &quot; equal pay for equal workers.&quot;f H.C. 248 of 1920. % See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 2, 8th January, p. 23.
Features of the Week-continued. Unemployment.Relief of Unemployment. In connection with the proposal to introduce short-time working into Government industrial establishments, the starting of the system at Woolwich Arsenal has been postponed from the 17th to the 24th January in order to co-ordinate the dates on which short time will begin in all the establishments affected. * No recon-sideration of the Cabinet decision is involved. Notices were posted at Portsmouth and Devonport Dockyards on the 15th January stating that general working hours will be reduced by seven per week from thet23rd January, so that employment may be found for the largest possible number of men, wages to be reduced in proportion. Attempts are being made to organise resistance at Woolwich. A mass meeting of employees at the Arsenal was held on the 15th January, and a resolution was passed pledging the men to refuse to accept the scheme. It is proposed that when the turn of the men to stand down comes, they shall present themselves for work as usual and refuse to leave the shops. A meeting of the representatives of the workers on the Departmental Joint Industrial Councils has been called for the 20th January with the object of organising this &quot; stay-in &quot; policy in all the establishments coming under the order.The special sub-committee appointed by the Labour Party and the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress to draft a programme and policy on unemploy-ment have been in session during the week, and it is expected that they will be in a position to present their report to the national joint delegate conference which will be held in London on the 27th January.The Scottish Trades Union Congress, meeting at Glasgow on the 15th January, passed a resolution condemning the proposal of the Government to put the workers on short time, as useless, and of no avail to meet the present alarming crisis, and demanding full maintenance for the unemployed, a resumption of trade with Russia, and the distribution of food through local authority agencies. It was decided that the executive should have power to call a further conference to determine future action, should the authorities refuse to adopt the proposals set out in the resolution. The National Administrative Council of the Independent Labour Party have passed a somewhat similar resolution.The scheme of a number of London Mayors to form a body whose duty should be the allocation and distribution of the gifts for which they ask in a special appeal to the public has been further developed, and it is hoped that the organisation of relief in this direction will remove the necessity for street processions of unemployed, which are not considered a desirable method of obtaining funds, although police regulations exist for the supervision of street processions. The new body will be known as the Metropolitan Boroughs&apos; Mayors&apos; Committee on Unemployment. Headquarters are at the Holborn Town Hall.Short Time on Railways. The policy of the National Union of Railwaymen in regard to the employment position on the railways was discussed at a meeting of the executive committee on the 13th January. Mr. W. J. Abraham presided over the proceedings, which were private. At the close of the meeting Mr. Cramp issued the following official statement: &quot; The Executive have considered the question of dismissals and the alternative of working short time, and have decided that short time would result in placing a large number of members of the union below the poverty line, and would operate unequally between the various grades in the railway service. We have therefore resolved to advise our members to adhere to the guaranteed week. Further, the Executive have decided to take up with the Standing Committee of Railway Managers the question of completely abolishing overtime as well as the tonnage bonus system.&quot;Under the tonnage bonus system, the rapid clearance of goods is encouraged by extra pay, and its abolition, it is claimed, will necessitate the employment of a larger number of workers.The attitude of the union towards the situation was further defined in a manifesto issued to the members on the 14th January. This explains fully the reasons for opposing the introduction of short time. Part-time working is declared to be a violation of the principle of the guaranteed week which was embodied in the Agreement of March, 1919. The members are also urged to remember that it is a contravention of the spirit of the Agreement, if not of its express terms, for officials of the companies to invite the men to accept local variations. The situation is held to come within the scope of the joint com-mittee which was set up under the Agreement to deal with questions arising &quot; in regard to rates of pay and conditions of service of the men within the conciliation grades.&quot;* See p. 81 below.&apos;
Control of Industry.Railways. The question of the workers&apos; share in the control of the railways was discussed on the 14th January at a joint conference of the full executives of the National Union of Railwaymen, the Railway Clerks&apos; Association, and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen. A statement of the position prepared by the joint committee, whose appointment was announced in last week&apos;s Report, was considered in detail, and the following statement was issued at the close of the meeting : &quot; The joint executives, having carefully considered the future position of railways, reaffirm their belief that the only means whereby an efficient and economical transport system can exist is by a co-ordinated system under State control.&quot; We desire to make it clear to the Government that the repeated declaration of the railwaymen for a share in management and control was the considered judgment of men who desire their knowledge and experience to be utilised for the public good, and we are taking the necessary steps to inform the Ministry of Transport of our determination to obtain this essential change in tho workers&apos; conditions.&quot;The joint committee will continue to watch developments.The Central Council of Railway Stockholders&apos; Associations have issued a statement in condemnation of the proposals of the Ministry of Transport, which are described as &quot; confiscatory.&quot;Trade Union Topics.Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain. There are indications that the unofficial reform movement among coal miners is spreading to Durham and Northumberland. A conference of delegates from twelve lodges in Durham and two in Northumberland was held at the Co-operative Hall, Birtley, on the 8th January. The chief question discussed was the 5-day week and the 6-hour day, as in the case of miners in the South Wales andA protest is made in the manifesto against the action of the Midland Railway Co. on the ground that they have violated the Agreement by suggesting to certain employees of from 18 years of age to 23 years, that, as the company is no longer able to utilise their services in an adult capacity, they should continue upon junior work under the conditions of service applicable to juniors, with the alternative of dismissal. It is stated that recently a number of companies have been following the practice of dismissing youths when they reach the age of 18. This is considered serious in itself, as making the occupa-tion a &quot; blind-alley &quot; as far as these boys are concerned, and the further action of the Midland Railway Co. in going so far as to suggest voluntary acceptance of-a lower rate of wages than is applicable under the Agreement has been seized upon as a violation of its terms, and therefore actionable. The executive committee of the union announce that they have taken up the question with the company, the Standing Committee of Railway Managers, and the Ministry of Transport.Cotton Textile Industry: Short Time. At a special meeting, held at Manchester on the 11th January, of those members of the General Committee of the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations concerned with the Egyptian section of the industry, it was decided to extend the period of short-time working in this section for two weeks, instead of a mouth as on previous occasions. It wafl also resolved to take a ballot of the members of this section to decide whether short-time working should be continued after the expiration of the two weeks. If the ballot is in favour of continuance, the General Committee will meet fortnightly to review the state of trade and decide what action shall be taken.Effect on Trade Unions. Further reports have been received of the suspension or reduction of trade union benefits owing to the serious unemployment position. The Preston and District Power Loom Weavers, Winders and Warpers&apos; Association held a meeting to consider the situation on the 11th January, and a recommendation of the executive that the members should go on half benefits for a month was carried almost unanimously. The Rochdale and District Weavers, Winders, Reelers and Beamers&apos; Association have decided upon a total suspension of benefits for the time being, as from the 4th January ; while it has been arranged that members in full employment shall pay full contributions and members on short time only half the usual contribution.
NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Building Trades Operatives (Bristol).-lt is reported that the Bristol Master Builders&apos; Association have given notice to the effect that, under the working rules, they propose to reduce wages by id. an hour as from the 1st May, 1921.* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 2, 8th January, p. 26. f See this Report, Vol. II, No. 25, 18th December, p. 671.Scottish coalfields. The existing unions were also criticised, and a demand was made for reorganisation on the lines of industrial unionism. It should be noted that, after the recent coal strike, a resolution of &quot; no confidence &quot; in the local trade union officials in Durham was defeated by a large majority.Amalgamation of Seamen&apos;s Unions. It is now reported that the scheme for the amalgamation of the various unions for seamen has broken down, apparently owing to the long-standing hostility between the National Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Union and the British Seafarers&apos; Union. A few months ago a scheme for amalgamation was agreed upon by a joint sub-committee representing these two unions, and provisional arrange-ments for amalgamation were also made between the National Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Union, the National Union of Ships&apos; Stewards, Cooks, Butchers and Bakers, and the Hull Seamen and Marine Firemen&apos;s Amalgamated Association. A joint committee, representing the four bodies, were to have arranged a ballot of the members. It appears, however, that the proposals have been rejected by a delegate conference of the National Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Union, and the other organisations have been informed that all arrange-ments for the joint committee are cancelled, and that no further steps can be taken with regard to the amalgamation.Scottish Building Unions. It is reported that those Scottish building unions not already affiliated to the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives have decided to take a ballot vote of their members on the question of affiliation to that Federation. This adds interest to the consultation of the Scottish National Building Trades Federation (Employers) and the Scottish Building Contractors&apos; Association, with the National Federa-tion of Building Trades Employers, with reference to the recent claim for an advance in wages made by the Scottish building trades operatives. *Gaff enters and Woodcutting Machinists. The dispute between the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners and the Amalgamated Society of Wood-cutting Machinists with regard to the withdrawal of labour from Messrs. Boulton and Paul, Ltd., Norwich,f has been settled by a resolution of the woodcutting machinists to obey the ruling of the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives, and withdraw immediately all their members employed by this firm.Trade Union Amalgamations. The name of the new society which came into existence on the 1st January, 1921, as the result of the amalgamation of the United Operative Masons&apos; Association of Scotland with the United Operative Masons&apos; and Granite Workers&apos; Union, the Glasgow and District Tilelayers&apos; Association, and the Scottish Associated Paviors&apos; Federal Union (Glasgow), is the &quot; Building and Monumental Workers&apos; Union,&quot; not the &quot; United Operative Masons&apos; Association of Scotland,&quot; as was inadvertently stated on p. 47 of last week&apos;s Report.It should also be noted that the correct name of the society formed by the amalga-mation of the Operative Bricklayers&apos; Society, the Manchester Unity of Operative Brick-layers&apos; Trade, Accident, Sick and Burial Society, and the Operative Society of Stone-masons, Quarrymen and Allied Trades of England and Wales, referred to on page 25 of the Report for 8th January, is now reported to be the &quot; Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers.&quot; Mr. George Hicks has been appointed general secretary of the new union.
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.Hosiery Trade Operatives (Scotland). In connection witli the dispute arising out of the decision of the West of Scotland Hosiery Manufacturers&apos; Association not to pay advances under Industrial Court Award No. 422*, it is understood that the manufacturers in the Dumfries district have now complied with the full provisions of the Award by making retrospective payment of the advance as from the 8th May last. It will be re-membered that at Dumfries about 1,000 operatives belonging to the Workers&apos; Union refused to resume work at reduced rates ; while the manufacturers stated that they could not continue operations in consequence of trade depression. At Kilmarnock, members of. the Workers&apos; Union have instituted prosecution proceedings before the Small Debt Court against several manufacturers in the district, in respect of non-compliance with the award.Shop Assistants (London). -The present position with regard to the dispute between the National Amalgamated. Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks and London West-End firms was dealt with briefly in this Report last week. Further details of Industrial Court Award No. 594 may now be given. The Court fixed minimum rates, varying according to age and sex, for clerks and checkers, salesmen and saleswomen, packers and warehousemen, porters, messengers and liftmen, employees in the provision factory and waitresses in the refreshment department. The cases of other employees were recommended to the consideration of the Army and Navy Co-operative Society, Ltd. Minimum rates were also fixed for foremen, chief clerks, stock-keepers, assistant stock-keepers and charge hands, and conditions were laid down as to the length of*service required to qualify for the minimum rates. Working conditions were left unaltered save for a decision that, in cases of dismissal after not less than six months&apos; service, the employee concerned should be entitled to one day&apos;s pay for each day&apos;s holiday accrued and not taken.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Blacksmiths and Ironworkers (Willenhall). In December, 1920, Messrs. Vaughan Bros., Eagle Stamping Works, Willenhall, Staffs, issued a notice to their employees that unless they were prepared to accept a 50 per cent, reduction of bonuses, the firm, would be compelled to close down for three months owing to depression in trade. Subsequent negotiations between the firms and the Associated Blacksmiths and Ironworkers&apos; Society have proved abortive.Settlements and Agreements.Heating and Domestic Engineers (London). An agreement has been reached between the London district of the National Association of Master Heating and Domestic Engineers and the National Union of Operative Heating and Domestic Engineers with regard to working rules and conditions. The agreement includes a provision that in the assessment of out-working allowances the job is to be considered as equivalent to the shop, and that the workman is to be on the job and leave the job at the required hours. The effect will be to entitle the operatives in all cases to such allowances as walking time when the distance from the workman&apos;s home to the job exceeds the distance from the home to the employees shop. A &quot; conciliation &quot; rule prescribes that disputes may be brought before a conference composed of representatives of the employers&apos; association and the union. Failing settlement the conference may apply to the Ministry of Labour for an arbitrator, such arbitrators decision to be final and binding.   -Cutlery Trade Operatives (Sheffield). With regard to the negotiations in the Sheffield cutlery trade arising out of the operatives&apos; application for an increase of 25 per cent, to piece-workers and time-workers, the cutlery manufacturers have agreed to reconsider the position six months hence, and the operatives have accepted the proposal in view of the present trade depression.Process Engravers (National). The Master Process Engravers and the Amalgamated Society of Lithographic Artists, Designers, Engravers and Process Workers have nego-tiated a new agreement which comes into effect as from the 1st January last. The agree-ment is to remain in force for two years. The rate for all classes of journeymen is  5 5s. per week, except in London, where the rate is  5 9s. Qd. The workers agree to co-operate with the employers in maintaining the selling price of process blocks and to withdraw their labour from any master process engraver who attempts to undercut the Federation* Sec this Report, Vol. II, No. 24, 11th December, p. 658, and Vol. Ill, No. 1, 1st January, p. 10
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.price-list; while the Federation agree to employ all workers so withdrawn at the current rates of wages. All variations in price rates are to be reported to the Amalgamated Society. Differences arising out of the agreement are to be referred to the Joint Industrial Council for the Printing and Allied Trades.[Other disputes, negotiations, and settlements are referred to in the Industrial Relations Department section of the Report, pages 76 to 83.](b 16873t)K
PART IL-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DEPARTMENT.ENGINEERING, SHIPBUILDING AND ALLIED TRADES.Engineering Trade Joint Council for Government Industrial Establishments. This council was set up in October, 1920, the departments represented being the Admiralty, the Air Ministry, the Office of Works, the War Office, the Ministry of Labour, and the Treasury. At the first meeting, held on the 13th October, 1920, the business was mainly formal. At the second meeting, on the 17th November, the National Union of Operative Heating and Domestic Engineers moved a resolution, supported by the Amalgamated Engineering Union, that the rate of 2s. 4jcZ., already paid to some of the fitters employed by the Office of Works, should be paid to all fitters in the two grades of fitters, engineering and hot water, employed by the Office of Works. The rate claimed was that agreed in the heating and domestic engineering trade, plus fd on account of certain trade union privileges. Consideration was postponed, as the union side agreed to supply evidence that engineering firms, generally, paid the one rate to grades similar to those employed by the Office of Works.At the third meeting, on the 3rd December, it was agreed that the Office of Works should consider with the trade union representatives a re-arrangement of duties, and any resultant re-grading of workmen which might be considered desirable.At the fourth meeting, on the 17th December, the Office of Works intimated that, at a meeting of the committee of representatives of the Office of Works and of the trade unions, the trade union representatives would not discuss the question of demarcation or depart in any way from their original application. There was, therefore, no alternative but to bring the matter back to the Council. It was alleged by the union representatives, however, that the official side of the committee had failed to make out a case for any differentiation among the workmen concerned, and that the re-grading would involve friction and loss of interchangeability. They feared, too, that it would involve the discharge of men graded on the higher rate, and the employment of fresh men on the lower rate. The chairman of the Council intimated that the committee were prepared to consider the various cases individually, and with goodwill on both sides, and that he failed to understand why an agreement on re-grading could not be reached. The trade union side agreed to meet the Office of Works again and endeavour to come to some agreement.At the same meeting the Workers&apos; Union raised the question of an advance of 3s. per week as from the 22nd December, on behalf of the women employed in the factories of the Air Ministry.  The chairman replied that the official side would consider the matter and give a decision at the next meeting.At the fifth meeting, on the 3rd January, 1921, a statement was made by the official side that there would be no objection, as far as they were concerned, to men being called fitters, and paid hot-water fitters&apos; rates, while on hot-water work. This proposal disposed of the objection held by the Amalgamated Engineering Union to any of their members being booked on merely as hot-water fitters, and the trade union side ultimately agreed to meet the Office of Works again to see whether it would be possible to dispose of the matter along these lines. As regards the case of the women workers employed by the Air Ministry, it was ultimately agreed that the case should go to arbitration.Shipbuilding Trade Joint Council for Government Establishments. The first meeting of this Council was held on the 13th October, 1920. The employees&apos; side raised the question of the right of trade unionists employed in industrial establishments of the
WOODWORKING AND FURNISHING TRADES.Cooperage. The Joint Industrial Council met on the 11th January. The constitution was amended in order to permit, of a member of the Council, unable to attend, being repre-sented by an accredited member of his society, who should have power to take part in the proceedings but not to vote.An application for an increase of wages was further considered, but the employers persisted in their refusal to grant any increase, and the workers&apos; side, recognising the present unfavourable conditions of the industry, did not press the question further. The Ministers letter on the question of short-time working was read, and a resolution was passed that in the opinion of the Council it was desirable that employers should, as far as circumstances permit, avoid adding to unemployment by discharging workmen and that it would be infinitely better to work short time and thereb)?&apos; keep a larger number of men employed, and, wherever it is possible to increase employment, to take on even more workmen with the consent of the trade union concerned.Paclcing-Case Makers (London). It is reported that Messrs. P. Keevil and Sons, Ltd., Paddington, discharged the workmen in their packing-case making department, who refused to agree to a reduction of wages below the union rate. The Chief Conciliation Officer learned that the trade union suggested negotiations on the basis of a piece-work system. The firm were visited, but saw no use in meeting the union, as they were determined to give up making cases as long as they could purchase similar cases more cheaply. They stated that a piece-work system had already been tried, and had not proved satisfactory.(B 16873T) K government to go on strike. In reply the chairman of the official side read the following ruling of the Government: &quot; It is true that there is no statutory prohibition of strikes by civil servants. Such a prohibition has not hitherto been found necessary, for civil servants have recognised that the fact that they are servants of the State and the conditions of their establishment, with pensions on retirement, impose special obligations upon them, and differentiate their case from that of the employees of any private trader for profit. But the principle upon which Parliament has proceeded in giving legal sanction to the award of pensions to civil servants is that they should have rendered faithful and satisfactory service, and this primary condition cannot be held to have been satisfied in the case of servants of the State who by striking have endangered or prevented the carrying on of the public service for which Government is responsible to Parliament and the community.&quot;At the second meeting on the 17th November, the question of allowing one week&apos;s leave per year, with pay, to Government industrial employees was referred to the Joint Co-ordination Committee. A scheme was approved for setting up local committees to deal with general questions of demarcation in the dockyards. Questions referred from the local committee are to be dealt with by the appropriate Trade Joint Council.At the third meeting, on the 5th December, 1920, the representative of the Amalga-mated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners complained of the introduction of new working conditions in the joinery department without consultation with the yard and department committees or the accredited trade union concerned. The union alleged that considerable pressure had been put by yard officers upon joiners to accept piece-work. The answer of the official side was that the intention of the Admiralty was simply to make it optional for a man to accept piece-work if he liked, and that the Admiralty undertook to make inquiries into the truth of the allegation that yard officers had put pressure on the men.Reduction of Wages (Birmingham). Messrs. Banks and Davis, Ltd., notified their workpeople of their intention to reduce the existing bonuses by 25 per cent, owing to the acute depression in trade. The firm stated that all their employees, except six blacksmiths, had agreed to accept a temporary reduction of 10 per cent, on their total earnings. At a conference, arranged by the Chief Conciliation Officer, Birmingham, the firm explained the position fully to the representative of the National Union of General Workers, who offered to advise the men to accept a reduction of 10 per cent, on the war bonus. The firm, however, insisted on a reduction of 10 per cent, on total earnings. At the suggestion of the Chief Conciliation Officer, the men were interviewed and, on the firm&apos;s assurance that the reduction was only temporary, the men unanimously agreed to accept it.
BUILDING AND WORKS OF CONSTRUCTION.Building. The Royal Institute of British Architects and the Society of Architects have now agreed to elect representatives&apos; to serve on the Building Industrial Council in a consultative capacity.

The annual meeting of the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee was held on the 13th January. -Mr. H. J. C. Johnston, of the Employers&apos; National Council for the Clay Industries, was elected chairman for the ensuing year and Mr. J. W. Clark, of the Workers&apos; Union, vice-chairman.The employers&apos; side refused to consider any proposal to fix national overtime rates for kiln burners, on the ground that the prosperity of the industry was waning, and nothing in the nature of an increase on working costs could be afforded. They also refused to agree to refer the matter to the Industrial Court, on account of the great variety of conditions of employment throughout the industry. The labour side stated that they would take action to enforce their demands locally.A sub-committee was appointed to consider whether the Minister of Health should be requested to remove the restrictions on luxury building in view of the great amount of unemployment. The Ministers letter on the subject of short time was referred to this sub-committee. It was decided that the formation of District Councils should be taken in hand as early as possible. The secretary of the workers&apos; side gave notice that he pro-posed to move at the next meeting that an inquiry should be made into the employment of females in the clay industries.Quarrying (Freestone Section). An informal conference of the unions concerned in this section was held by the department on the 12th January. There were present repre-sentatives of the National Union of General Workers, the Workers&apos; Union, and the Operative Society of Stonemasons, Quarrymen and Allied Trades. The conference dis-cussed the advisability of setting up some 15 district councils and, at the same time, drawing up a constitution for a National Sectional Council for the Freestone Industry. Finally the following resolution was agreed : &quot; That the trade unions represented on this conference consider that the time is now ripe for the creation of a National Joint Council for the Freestone Section, and consider it important that all districts thereof shall be represented in sorne way. They offer no objection to the employers&apos; proposed representation on a district basis, but consider that the trade union representation should be arranged on a national basis in a proportion to be decided among themselves, and agree that a sub-committee be appointed to draw up a constitution for a National Sectional Council.&quot;Members of the sub-committee were provisionally appointed. The employers were unable to attend an afternoon conference, but the secretary of the National Quarrying Council was interviewed and expressed his general approval of action on these lines.FOOD AND DRINK.Bakers (South Wales). The Swansea strike continues. Several conferences have been held during the week, but the employers would not consider arbitration, nor would they accept any suggestions of a form of sliding scale. They agreed that if the men would return on the pre-strike wages, the matter would be reconsidered in joint conference in three months&apos; time. The Swansea Labour Association have deferred their threatened drastic action until after a further conference, to be held on the 17th January. Meanwhile the master bakers have maintained the bread supply, and the threat to extend the strike appears to have stiffened their opposition to any concession.Scottish Bakers. Complete resumption has not yet been secured, but only about 40 workmen remain on strike. It is doubtful whether these men will continue to receive the support of the union. No further meeting of the Council has been asked for by either side.Fishing Industry (Grimsby). Following on the refusal of the trawler owners to sub-mit the matter in dispute to arbitration, a proposal was made by the department for a joint conference of the parties under the chairmanship of an officer of the Ministry. The owners have replied that they do not see that any good purpose can be served by such a conference and have declined to attend.   The union have not replied.
Flour milling.--With reference to the meeting of the Joint Industrial Council on the 7th January, reported last week, one of the items on the agenda, an application for an increase of wages and a shorter working week, was withdrawn.

The unions pressed for postponement until the next quarterly meeting, in April, when it was expected that they would be prepared to negotiate a settlement.MINING.China Clay. At a recent meeting of the Joint Industrial Council the workers repre-sentatives presented a claim for full pay instead of half pay for wet time lost, or alterna-tively, an increase from Is. Qd. to Is. 9d. per hour, and payment for four days&apos; holiday a year. Owing to the state of trade, the employers were unable to agree to this, and offered to continue the present terms, but stipulated that time-and-a-quarter should not be paid for overtime until 46 hours a week had been worked. The normal working week is 42 hours. &apos; The Council passed a resolution affirming that, in the present state of trade, it is not contrary to the constitution and spirit of Industrial Councils for individual firms to shorten hours without the permission of the Council.PRINTING AND PAPER.Envelopes and Manufactured Stationery.

It was not competent for the official representatives to discuss the general principle of short time, as this had been decided upon by the Cabinet, but they were fully prepared to consider the best method of applying it in the various establishments. The trade union repre-sentatives held a separate meeting to consider their position. When the conference resumed, the chairman of the trade union side announced that they had decided to reject any proposal for short time which involved a reduction in wages, and it was desired, that this opinion should be submitted to the Cabinet. They also desired, to record their opinion that the Cabinet had not acted in accordance with the principles of&quot; Whitleyism,&quot; and that this would foster the unpopularity of &quot; Whitleyism &quot; that existed among certain sections of the men, and would seriously prejudice the position of those trade unionists who were party to the Councils. Sir Malcolm Ramsay undertook that their point of view should be submitted to the Cabinet, and that a reply would be sent to the chairman of the trade union side of the conference, although he could hold out no hope of a reversal of the Cabinefs decision on the principle of short time.

In most districts the unemployment position is regarded as critical, and there is a feeling of apprehension in some districts that, with the continued absence of orders, even short time may soon become impracticable.Shipbuilding and Allied Industries. Reports from the Clyde indicate that, apart from the lull usual at this time of the year, the cancellation of orders is seriously affecting skilled workers. Ship-repair work has, however, been fairly brisk, but future work is not too plentiful. Reports from the Tyne, Tees and Wear indicate a continuance of the general depression. Ship-repair work in the Hartlepool area has been intermittent since May, 1920; numbers of workers have exhausted their benefit. Although this has been largely attributed to a shortage of material, there are indications of a disposition among employers to suspend operations until prices of materials have become more stabilised. On the Mersey, Garston report that shipbuilding is slightly better. Both Bootle and Birkenhead report that repair work mainly consists of small jobs, and that, owing to high prices in the district, the larger contracts are being diverted to other ports. In South Wales ship-repairing has improved considerably. At Swansea and Barry nearly all the shipyard workers have been fully employed, and, although the position at Bute Docks and Newport is at present unchanged, it is considered that the improvement noticeable at other ports in South Wales may soon affect these places also. At Southampton the prospect is gloomy, as, owing to the uncertainty in the industrial situation, employers are rinding it impossible to accept further contracts. In the London district increased activity in the local shipyards is reported at Poplar.Transport. The position in regard to transport workers in South Wales is improving, particularly at Swansea and Newport; and at Barry and Bute Docks the position is fairly satisfactory. On the other hand, the position at Avonmouth, Liverpool and Grimsby is still unfavourable, and the increase of work at Hull which it was hoped would result from the removal of the embargo on the export of coal has not yet materialised.Other Industries. The North-Western Division report that there are no signs of improvement in the cotton trade ; it is anticipated that further curtailment of production in the Egyptian section may be looked^for.*  Generally speaking, the industry is working* See p. 72 above.(b 16873T) L 2
Employment and Insurance Department-continued.from hand to mouth, and frequent stoppages are bound to occur until the demands increase. Other industries seriously depressed in this division are hatting, at Denton, Hyde and Stockport; and iron-ore mining at Barrow. Sheffield report that all the workers engaged in the gold and silver trades are expected to be put on short time at an early date, in which case some 7,500 men and women will be affected.The position of the tinplate industry in South Wales is still serious. At Llanelly ten works are entirely closed, and at four other works the employees are on a day-to-day contract.Acute depression is still the feature of the motor engineering and metal trades, and there is no abatement of tue systematic short-time working in the wool textile and lace trades. At Leicester, however, hosiery-machine building is inclined to be busy. In the boot and shoe industry the position appears to be growing worse. Many firms in the Northampton district who hoped to resume business after the Christmas holidays have not done so, and in other instances, where it was hoped to work five days per week, only three days will be worked. Many small firms are entirely without orders, and have closed down indefinitely.The London (Central) Exchange for the building trades report that the demand for plasterers and bricklayers is still far in excess of the supply. Orders for carpenters, joiners and plumbers have fallen off to a considerable extent. The situation in respect of painters is very acute and the number of unemployed in this trade is increasing daily.Labour Reductions.-DoveT report that the Stanlee ship breaking Co., who employ about 400 men, are closing down ; owing to the state of the market they cannot obtain a sufficient price for their steel.At Enfield the Edison Swan Electric Co., Ltd., are considering a reduction of staff in. all their shops, and it is possible that within the next week 100 workpeople will be discharged. Redruth report that the Levant and Geevor tin mines, at St. Just, are closing down, which will involve the discharge of 600 men. A large engineering firm in Nottingham have definitely discharged 500 workpeople, and at Liverpool the British American Tobacco Co., Ltd., have discharged 1,000 workpeople.Women&apos;s Employment.General Situation. No improvement can be reported in the general situation. Unemployment and short time still appear to be on the increase, although the extended holiday is generally reported to be over. The occupations in which unemployment is heaviest are the engineering and metal trades, the textile trades, the dress and clothing industries, general factory work, and work in domestic offices and service. Most of the women asking for domestic work are desirous of daily employment, and their numbers are swelled largely owing to the unemployment of the male members of their families.The heaviest figures are in the North-Western Division, owing to the severe depression in the cotton textile trade, and in the London and South-Eastern Division, owing to slackness in all general factories and in the clothing trades in London. The Yorkshire and East Midlands Division is affected by slackness in the woollen and cotton textile and the clothing trades. In the West Midlands Division depression in the engineering and metal trades is mainly responsible for the high registers. In Ireland the linen and flax industries are severely depressed, and the whole industry of the country has been dis-organised by civil disturbances.Local Reports. The North-Western Division report that the cotton industry is still responsible for an abnormal amount of under-employment and unemployment, and that this reacts to a great extent on other industries in the division. Many of the mills that have resumed work after a prolonged Christmas holiday have done so on a short-time basis. Abnormal unemployment continues at Liverpool in all branches of factory work. The British American Tobacco Co., Ltd., have discharged 600 women and girls and have given a month&apos;s wages in lieu of notice.The Yorkshire and East Midlands Division report that the depression in the woollen textile centres continues. At Brighouse approximately 1,600 textile workers are claiming benefit, and all firms are on short time. Similar reports are received from Keighley, Morley, Otley, Shipley, Stanningley and Wakefield. Dewsbury report stagnation in the local industries, and fear a continued spell of bad trade and unemployment.  Wholesale
Employment and Insurance Department-continued,clothing, hosiery, lace manufacture, blouse manufacture, and boot and shoemaking show continued depression. At Derby all local industries are affected, and at Nottingham the staple trades are said to be still further depressed.In the South Midlands and Eastern Division depression continues in the hosiery, wholesale clothing, boot and shoemanufacture, elastic web work and silk manufacture. At Chelmsford the Hoffmann Manufacturing Co., Ltd., ball-bearing manufacturers, are beginning to work short time three days a week, thus affecting 1,100 women. At Leicester few firms were able to resume work after the Christmas holidays, and 1,200 fresh claims to benefit have been made during the week. Several other firms, affecting a further 2,500 women, are adopting systematic short time. At Northampton the boot manufacturing firms who have restarted work are doing so on short time.Heavy registers and general unemployment continue to be reported by the London Exchanges. At Bermondsey the register is nearly 2,500 ; at the City Exchange the live register has doubled during the week ; at Deptford there are over 2,000 on the live register : at East Ham there are over 1,000; at Whitechapel over 3,500; at Tottenham nearly 2,000; and at Walham Green nearly 1,000. All the needlework trades are depressed, as also are the leather trade, the tin box trade, paper and printing, rubber manufacturing, furnishing, and food manufacturing.The West Midlands Division continue to report increasing unemployment in the metal, engineering, motor, cycle and rubber trades, from Birmingham, Sparkhill, West Broniwich, and Coventry. There is less activity in the pottery industry and an increase of claims to benefit is reported from Burslem, Hanley, Longton, and Stoke-on-Trent. There is continued depression in the leather trades at Walsall and Worcester.Depression in the tailoring, shirt and collar making, and in chocolate, glove, corset, match and tobacco manufacture is reported from the South-Western Division. At Bristol 13 firms are on short time and over 3,000 women are affected. The chocolate factory of Messrs. J. S. Fry and Sons, Ltd., is responsible for 2,500 short-time workers.In the Northern Division the live registers are increasing and at Carlisle there are nearly 1,400 current claims.Depression continues in Scotland in the textile trades, in cotton printing, in the linen, jute, hosiery and underclothing trades, in rubber manufacture, and in all general factory employment.LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Activities of Committees.Unemployment  The London Building Trades Committee urge that local authorities and Government departments should put in hand now any painting or decorating work which they may intend to carry out this year, in view of the unemployment among painters. This point was also raised by the Reading Committee recently. In the South-Western Division the committees are showing great activity. The Portsmouth Committee has taken the lead in calling a conference with the local authorities, employers&apos; organisations and trade unions. Similar action is also contemplated by the Exeter and the Weymouth Committees. The Llanelly Committee are arranging for a similar conference to discuss the best measures for meeting the depression in the tinplate industry. In Scotland the Wick and Kirkcaldy Committees are pressing the local authorities to initiate schemes of work.Miscellaneous. The Exeter Committee have put forward a proposal in connection with the classification of applicants. They suggest that, where an applicant cannot be found employment in the industry for which he or she registered, and declines to accept the advice of the Local Employment Committee as to employment in some other vocation, the Exchange manager should be authorised to include such an applicant in a special return distinct from the statistics of the unemployed. The committee are of opinion that this suggestion would help to make the unemployment figures more representative of the actual position.OUT-OF-WORK DONATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFIT.Out-of-Worh Donation  Returns by the Finance Department according to information received at the Claims and Record Office, Kew, for the week ending the 6th January, 1921, show 293,107 payments to policy holders, involving an amount of  274,522 11s. 4d.Unemployment Insurance. The number of payments of unemployment insurance benefit during the week ending the 31st December, 1920, was 368,187, involving an amount of  230,579 4s. Qd.
Employment and Insurance Department-continued.Stale of Unemployment Fund. The balance standing to the credit of the Uneinploy-ment Fund on 25th December, 1920, was  22,541,527. During the period from the 28th November to the 25th December, 1920,  450,000 was transferred, to the National Debt Commissioners for investment, making the total sum transferred  22,525,000.Advances to Workpeoj)le. The number of advances made in November, 1920, was 2,339 divided into 720 recoverable advances, and 1,619 non-recoverable advances. The total amount of recoverable advances was  731, compared with a total for October of  1,094.DISCHARGED  AND  DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.National Scheme. Up to and including the 11th January, 23,663 certificates have been issued to employers under the scheme. The undertakings given by these employers cover 261.280 disabled ex-Service men.The Divisional Controller of the South Midland and Eastern Division reports that during the past month the work in connection with the National Scheme has been adversely affected by the abnormal pressure of work in consequence of the new Unemployment Insurance Act, and by the steadily increasing number of unemployed fit ex-Service men. He hopes, however, to prepare four sets of lantern slides showing 40 different disability cases employed in various industries, together with explanatory notes and references to the National Scheme. It is proposed to exhibit these slides first of all in the larger towns where there are good theatres and music halls, as it is considered that the cinema does not attract a public in a position to help the Scheme.JUVENILE BRANCH.Juvenile Employment Committees.Employment of Dock Boys. Consideration has recently been given by the Swansea Juvenile Employment Committee to the problem of decasualising the work of sealers, rivet heaters and other boys employed in dry docks. At present it is usual for such boys to be engaged at the dock gates. As there are many more applicants than jobs available, many boys spend a large part of the day hanging about. The committee suggested that a definite number of boys should be registered at one centre, and that employers should be asked to engage boys only from that centre. They recognised that, from the nature of the occupation, there could be no guarantee that work would always be available even for this limited number, and they accordingly decided to endeavour to secure the co-operation of the education committee in starting suitable classes at the proposed centre for the boys during any periods of unemployment.This problem is also acute in the Merseyside areas, where boys are generally engaged from stands situated in different parts of the towns. The possibility of concerted action in the matter is being considered by the Juvenile Employment Committees concerned.Apprenticeship (Scarborough). At a recent meeting of the Scarborough Juvenile Advisory Committee regret was expressed at the lack of opportunity for apprenticing boys in the area. The opinions of local employers were quoted, to the effect that, in some trades, the high rates of wages fixed for learners and apprentices, and, in others, notably the building trade, the trade union restrictions on the proportion of apprentices to journeymen, were mainly responsible. The view was expressed that the trade union restrictions on the engagement of apprentices, introduced in order to prevent the flooding of the country by skilled workmen, would in reality result in a dearth of skilled men.Domestic Service (Liverpool). The lack of local facilities for training young domestic servants has been under discussion by the Liverpool Juvenile Employment Committee. There is a great demand for girls willing to undertake this work, 53 girls having been placed either in resident or daily domestic service during the past month. The committee decided to approach the wardens of the various settlements and residential hostels in Liverpool, to enlist their co-operation in training young girls in the general outlines of domestic service, and further recommended that the education committee should be asked to open a special unemployment centre where short courses of training could be provided.[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment and Insurance Department will also be found on pages 68, 69, 79, 82, 92 and 93. J
APPOINTMENTS AND TRAINING.APPOINTMENTS AND CIVIL LIABILITIES DEPARTMENT.APPOINTMENTS.Statistics. Dining the week ending the 7th January the Appointments Department placed 342 candidates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 48,070. Of these, 6,506 have been placed through the agency of the department^ Interviewing Boards. Applications were registered from 755 ex-Service men and 21 civilians. The number of candidates available for appointments, on the 7th January, was 10,514 ex-Service men and 1,383 civilians. At the same date, 1,110 &quot; live &quot; vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 441 having been registered during the week.Reports from Districts. In Aberdeen the unemployment question is acute ; a number of applicants placed with firms are not being retained and arc again coming on to the register.   This applies particularly to engineering.At Leeds industry generally is now at an absolute standstill throughout the district. Vacancies are almost impossible to obtain, and the placings which are being achieved are the result of strenuous individual efforts.The Director at Cardiff reports that a member of the Newport Rotary Club has notified the department of 20 vacancies at a salary of  260 and commission, all of which it is hoped to fill from applicants residing in this district.The Controller of the Appointments and Training Branch (Ireland) reports that in Ulster there has been a falling off in the number of private vacancies registered ; butthis has been compensated for by an increase in Government vacancies. The number of new registrations continues to be considerable. The resumption of work on the Irish railways should have a favourable effect upon business generally and thus improve the prospects of placing candidates.BUSINESS  AND  PROFESSIONAL  TRAINING.Maintenance and Training Grants Scheme. During the week ending the 7th January, the Appointments Department received 19 applications for training under this scheme, of which 15 were for training of the type provided by the department. Deducting cancellation-tions and withdrawals, 28,226 applications for training of this type have been received in all, and 49,833 for the types provided by other Government Departments. The Inter-viewing Boards have dealt to date with 27,651 applications, of which 23,182 have been recommended. The Grants Committee, dealing with applications so recommended, have received 22,081 applications, and sanctioned grants in 18,244 cases.Out of 104 candidates who were successful in the final examination of the Society of Incorporated Accountants and Auditors held in November, 1020, 33 were trainees under the Training Grants Scheme of the Ministry of Labour, including the winners of the second prize and second certificate of merit, and of the third prize and third certificate of merit.Business Training Scheme. During the week ending the 7th January the Appoint-ments Department received 165 applications for training under this scheme, bringing the total number of applications to 1,623, of which 290 have since been cancelled. Grants have been sanctioned in 256 cases. At the same date 323 &quot; live &quot; training vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 92 having been registered during the week.Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant. The Appointments Department have dealt with a total of 990 cases, in 460 of which the training sanctioned is provided by the Appointments Department and in the remainder by other Government departments. Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed their training in 251 cases, and abandoned training in 45 ; 145 are still in training, and 19 are awaiting training.TRAINING DEPARTMENT. INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men.Statistics. On the 11th January, 25,010 men were in training, as against 24,964 on the 4th January and 25,146 on the 14th December. The number of men placed in training during the week was 488. There were 16,293 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 4th January and the 14th December being 16,348 and 16,041 respectively.
The number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 23,734, the totals for the 4th January and the 14th December being 23,292 and 22,307, respectively. The rise in the number of men in training is accounted for, to some extent, by the fact that normal conditions now prevail again in the divisions and at the factories and training centres, after the Christmas break, but in any event the figure shows a con-siderable improvement on the records of the past few weeks.The monthly reports for December show that, despite the increasing difficulty of obtain-ing suitable openings for men completing institutional training, the efforts made in the divisions to secure vacancies were by no means unsuccessful. With regard to the waiting lists, the total number of approved cases in December, 3,513, though contrasting unfavour-ably with that for September, which was over 4,000, is fairly satisfactory, as in several leading trades no further admissions are being allowed. The Divisional Director for Scotland reports that the number of disabled men in employers&apos; workshops in his area increased from 438 on the 30th November to 401 at the end of December, after making allowance for the number who completed workshop training with maintenance. There is no doubt that the four local area training officers are largely responsible for this result. These officers are also able, through their constant visits to the workshops to which the men have been transferred after the institutional period, to report on their further progress. The training officer for the Northern Area states that as the result of his inspections of workshop training it seems clear that, allowing for wastage by sickness, emigration and other causes, about 90 per cent, of the men will make good as useful and employable craftsmen.Full figures are available showing the progress made in the London Division during 1920. At starting the number of men in training was well below 2,500 ; in May the figure rose to 4,118, and has remained about this level ever since, the highest point being reached in September, when the total was 4,240. There was a slight decline during the last three months of the year, but at the close there were still over 4,000 men in training in the division.Though progress was slow at starting, approximately 5,500 men have been placed in training in the London area since the 1st August, 1919. At the present date training is being given in 41 institutions, of which six are Government Instructional Factories, and in the workshops of 416 private firms.Vehicle Building. A suggestion has been made by the National Trade Advisory Com-mittee for Vehicle Building, that Government contracts could with advantage be placed at Government Instructional Factories in which men are being trained in the trade. The chief Government contracting departments have been informed of the terms of the resolu-tion, and asked to provide contracts for work to be carried out by men. in training.Elementary Teachers. The Board of Education have now formally agreed to the proposal to utilise the premises which have been acquired at Erith as a training college for manual instructors, under a scheme similar to that at Sarisbury Court. Accommodation can be provided for about 200 men. Up to the present it has been found impossible to proceed with the scheme for establishing a training college at Birtley, owing to local complications with regard to the question of premises. Other buildings in the neighbour-hood have been suggested ; probably the college will find its ultimate home at Gretna. It is believed that the training college at Springfield, Birmingham, will be open by the end of February at latest. Work at Sarisbury Court is proceeding smoothly, and the periodical reports on the men&apos;s general conduct and progress are highly satisfactory.Dental Mechanics. The problem of finding employment for men trained as dental mechanics is still very serious, and up to the present the War Office, the Admiralty, and the Air Board, who have been approached, have not been able to render any assistance.Hostels and Canteens. Special Treasury authority has been granted for the provision of mess-room facilities, wherever required in Government Instructional Factories. Experi-ence shows that, as a general rule, the mess-room affords the simplest and most satisfactory method of solving the problem of meals for men in training.In the hostels carried on under the direction of the Ministry, there are now 670 places available, of which about 60 per cent, were occupied on the 1st January. There are now over 600 men and instructors in residence at the three residential Government Instructional Factories, Sarisbury Court, Claydon, and Luton, and about three-fifths of the available accommodation is occupied.Government Instructional Factories. The Forbesfield Road Factory was inspected by the Minister during his recent visit to Aberdeen. He expressed his satisfaction at the development of the work of the factory, which is among the largest and most important of these institutions, and was one of the first to come on the active list.   Good progress is
reported as regards the marine motor mechanic-drivers&apos; class. The manager has obtained a good motor-boat on loan, to replace that recently lost at sea. There are contracts in hand here to the value of  2,410, and sales for December have been very good.The contract for the repair of the roof of the stores at the Birtley Factory, recently damaged by fire, which was given to the carpentry and joinery class at the factory, lias been carried out satisfactorily by men in training, assisted by one tradesman.Very satisfactory reports have been received as regards the progress of the tailoring classes at the Government instructional Factory, High Road, Tottenham. At this factory 90 per cent, of the men in training are engaged on productive work ; the majority are carrying out bespoke orders for uniforms for the attendants at the Springfield Mental Hospital.The Hackney Borough Council have given permission for men in training at the Government Instructional Factory, Hackney Marshes, to visit the Council^ power station for instructional purposes.The policy of closing down outlying centres, and centralising as far as possible all institutional instruction in Government Instructional Factories, is being developed in the East Anglian Division, where the boot and shoe class has now been transferred from the technical institute at Norwich to the St. James&apos; Mill Government Instructional Factory.Local Technical Advisory Committees : Shipbuilding, Engineering and Electricity. A meeting of the Local Technical Advisory Committee for Bedford and Luton was held at Bedford on the 12th January, when the assistant secretary of the National Trade Advisory Committee was in attendance. The committee have agreed to train in pattern-making at the Government Instructional Factory, and they also hope to commence train-ing in coppersmithing and foundry work at an early date. The committee have also approved in general the Ministry of Pensions scheme for training at convalescent centres.Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.Statistics. Up to the 12th January agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 45,259 apprentices under the 41 schemes approved. Grants had been sanc-tioned in respect of 43,286 apprentices, employed by 17,269 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed, on expiration of the appropriate period of training or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 16,542.Wages. Difficulties are again reported in the boot and shoe repairing industry, in regard to the application of the Trade Board regulations to apprentices under the scheme. The payment of the full Trade Board rates at 21, in place of the proportions of the pre-scribed rates set out in the scheme, necessarily involves a considerable increase in the employees payments, and is strongly objected to by some firms. In Scotland, for instance, an employer dismissed his apprentice when the Trade Board rates became payable, arguing that the agreement was no longer enforceable, if these rates were to supersede those of the scheme. The case has been before the Trade Panel of the Local Employment Committee, who failed to agree on the matter, and have referred it to an arbitrator. In. Lancashire similar trouble has arisen with two Blackburn firms, one of whom takes the line that either the original agreement should stand, or, if the full rate is enforced, the additional amounts should be paid by the State.Objection to including the 12-1 per cent, bonus in calculating the prescribed rate under the engineering scheme, where apprentices eligible for State grant are still under 21, has been raised by the Scottish Motor Traction Co., Ltd., Edinburgh. They maintain that, as the award was specifically limited to men over 21, it should not be taken into account in determining the wages of men under that age. It has been made clear to them that payments under the scheme are based upon deductions from the rate of a fully-qualified journeyman, so that the bonus has to be included in all cases in the prescribed rate. Never-theless, they have definitely refused to adjust matters. In other respects their attitude has been favourable ; for, in addition to their own apprentices, they have brought under the scheme others not previously in their employment.Applications. Reports regarding late applications, which are still being received, seem to indicate that certain, well-known firms have shown lack of care in dealing with the matter, to the detriment of the apprentices concerned. Thus, an apprentice fitter and turner of Messrs. Vickers, Ltd., Erith, reported, recently that he had never even heard of the scheme. He has been employed since his demobilisation till a short time ago, but on such specialised work that he cannot now obtain employment.   He would still have(b 16873t) M
some months of his renewed apprenticeship to complete, on the assumption that his previous work counted as training under the scheme.Acceptance or JSon-Acceptance.--Reference has been made in previous reports to the difficulties experienced in securing the re-instatement of all the returning apprentices of Sir W. G. Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co., Ltd., Elswick. In a number of cases this has proved impossible, the firm&apos;s contention being apparently that the men. are not eligible. Attempts to provide for them elsewhere have been further hindered by the support given to the firm&apos;s views by members of the Newcastle Employment Committee. Ten such apprentices were found employers, but, when their cases came before the Trade Panel of the committee, a deadlock was reached. The employers&apos; representative strongly opposed the acceptance of the apprentices, and the trade union representative as strongy advocated it. The facts available appear clearly to support the applications, but it was only after the most vigorous representations both by the Chief Local Officer and by the Divisional Controller of the Employment Department, that the employers&apos; representative agreed to accept the apprentices.Progress of Training. Specially favourable conditions are provided by Messrs. Barclay, Curie &amp; Co., Ltd., Glasgow, engineers, whose works are reported to be one of the finest training centres on the Clyde. From the general manager down to the individual foremen, who are immediately responsible for ex-Service apprentices, every desire is shown to assist them. Special attention is directed to the variety of the work, and an endeavour is made to give each apprentice an intimate knowledge of all the processes of his trade.Unemployment. Further evidence is forthcoming of the difficulties which arise in connection with apprentices under the scheme, owing to the growing depression of trade. Messrs. Holman &amp; Sons, Camborne, mining engineers, have been compelled to dismiss a number of single men, among them an apprentice under the scheme. They are unable at present to reinstate him owing to lack of work. As a result of the representations of local headquarters, however, they have promised in future to give preferential treatment, as regards discharges, to apprentices under the scheme. Hitherto their general policy has been to dismiss the single men and retain the married. Again, in London, an important engineering company are reported to have almost closed their works, retaining only foremen and charge hands.Institutional Training. An interesting point in regard to payment of maintenance allowance during vacations has arisen as a result of the depression in trade. Normally apprentices in receipt of institutional training return to the workshops during vacations, but, as many linns are closed down for ten days or a fortnight, they cannot do this, and in Scotland many of them are applying for the maintenance allowance for periods when they are thus compulsorily idle.General Training.Apprenticeship : Building. The Southern Counties Area Joint Council have accepted the scheme, and have apparently taken preliminary steps to establish local apprenticeship committees. They have not yet formally adopted it, or incorporated it in their working rules ; but this step is expected shortly, and will probably take effect as from the 1st January. At Sevenoaks, both sides are reported to be favourable, and the prospects of a joint conference are good. At South Shields, the employers&apos; association have already suggested dates for a conference and the department are in touch with the operatives on the subject. At Coventry, each side has appointed a sub-committee to consider the scheme, but joint negotiation may be delayed by the need of settling a wages question. At Kidder-minster, and in the Potteries, both employers and operatives are to consider the scheme. The latter case is specially satisfactory as the general relations between the two sides are not of the best. At St. Helens, steps are being taken to organise a conference, and at Crewe, where great ignorance of the scheme had prevailed, it is being successfully brought to the notice of both sides. At York, where the employers as a body are strongly opposed to admitting the operatives to any joint control of apprentices, negotiations with individuals have revealed a less unyielding attitude, and the position is somewhat more hopeful.General Training and Conditions : Engineering. The Lancashire Dynamo and Motor Co., Ltd., Manchester, are bringing into operation, as from, the 1st January, an elaborate scheme both of workshop and technical training. A less complete scheme, which has been in operation for some time, has been so successful that they have thoroughly elaborated it. The full scheme is the result of the joint efforts of the management, the shop foremen, the
works committee and the welfare supervisor. A list of processes to be learnt and of the time to be spent on each has been prepared. The foremen are to be responsible for the actual training and the welfare supervisor for the transfer of apprentices from process to process.The works school of Leyland Motors, Ltd., is reported to be developing into a most useful institution, and the firm have overcome the difficulties that are liable to arise during school holidays in the case of part-time students. They have arranged for various classes, during vacations, to be taken by their office staff&apos;, and for visits by the boys to various works. They are also organising evening classes for adults at the school.Supply of Apprentices : Tinsmithing. A Birmingham firm report that the trade is very largely restricted, as regards both apprentices and the use of machinery, by the union concerned, and that, as a result, practically no apprentices are now learning the trade. On the other hand, trained tinsmiths are alleged to be working &quot; on their own in their own backyards &quot; where they use the machinery which they refuse to handle in the factories.[Reference to matters of interest to the Appointments and Training Departments will also be found on pages 82 and 88.]
