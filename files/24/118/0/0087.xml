II. EMERGENCY WORK.The Prime Minister made a statement in the House of Commons on the 19th October on the proposals of the Government to provide against unemployment. He outlined schemes for employing a large number of fit ex-Service men in connection with the Housing Programme, on which negotiations with the trade unions were proceeding; and schemes for anticipating a four years&apos; programme for Arterial Roads in London and in the provinces; whilst at the same time pressing forward with the Ministry of Trans port&apos;s programme of road classification and maintenance grants.A further statement was made by the Minister of Labour on the 21st December, indicating that the further proposals of the Government included: a final endeavour to secure an agreement with the building trades for the admission of ex-Service men; a rapid extension of road construction schemes; the distribution by the Unemploy-ment Grants Committee, under the Chairmanship of Yiscount St. Davids, of a sum of  3,000,000 for the purpose of assisting local authorities on relief schemes other than house building and road work; and the amendment of the Unemployment Insurance Act (1920) in order to enable benefit to be paid to workpeople who had been unemployed since the Act came into operation and could not therefore qualify for benefit. It has since been agreed that the Unemployment Grants Committee shall also deal with schemes in respect of road work other than those undertaken by the Ministry of Transport.ROAD WORK PROGRAMME.

The position in the cotton industry remains the same, and it is reported that a number of the trade unions have been obliged to suspend or reduce their unemployment benefits. The position remains abnormal in the iron and steel industry, and conditions are unchanged in the tinplate, woollen and hosiery trades. In the boot and shoe industry a few firms are now reported to be working normal hours, but the majority are still on short time. In the London area, unemployment is becoming increasingly acute and is affecting nearly all trades. From the South of England it is reported that unemployment is occurring among agricultural workers owing to the recent rise in the minimum rates of wages.

The restriction in. regard to road work has since been removed.Works are approved only in areas where serious unemployment exists which is not otherwise provided for.   Preference in employment is given to ex-Service men.
Grants do not exceed 60 per cent, of the wages bill of additional unemployed men engaged, and the works undertaken are such as are approved by the appropriate Government Departments as suitable works of public utility.Up to the 21st January applications for grants by thirty-eight Local Authorities had been sanctioned by the Committee in respect of 103 schemes.
