4hl  IxCiUt Li\ a &quot;MS1 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BEITAN!IIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.T/ith reference to the Minister of Labour&apos;s Memorandum CP. 2461, I have to observe as to point (1) that I received from the Secretary to the Cabinet y^Bonoo-Commir^W^the letter as to housing of which a copy is appended to this memorandum.I am sending to the Finance Committee a memorandum explaining that In my view the actual proposals laid before them are impracticable, but making suggestions for a line of action which will I think result in economies, while ensuring the carrying out of an adequate programme     In framing my proposals I have of course had In mind the important bearing of the unemployment question and the negotiations with the Building Trade on future housing policy.As regards point (2) in the Minister of Labour!s memorandum, what the Report of the Registrar General says is that the estimated increase of population between 1911 and 1919 would reauire a net addition of 140.000 houses, aoart from replace-ment of defective houses^ and in order^ to^ maintain the 1911 J*y e D-&amp; e of hous mgo tCertain nev.-spc.pers have taken hold of the figure 140,000 and. used it without qualification as the measure of present housing needs.     I had proposed that the Registrar General should himself take a suitable opportunity (which will offer this ^eek) to draw the attention of the pre*s to ^hat he actually sa d in his Report.T,:to considerations alone are sufficient to indicate that the statement&quot;in the report is useless as a measure of housing needs; (1) the qualifications &quot;:which the Registrar General him-self made that the 1911 average of housing was assumed as theMemorandum by the Minister of Health.HOUSING.
basis and no account was taken of replacement of defective houses and it must be remembered that the chief ground for the long-continued.and acute agitation on housing needs which preceded the Government proposals was that, apart from over-crowding, tens of thousands of existing habitations were little better than breeding grounds of disease and discontent and needed replacements.     The surveys which have been carried out under the existing Act abundantly confirm these complaints (2) that the estimate was an estimate of the total increase of the population, without reference to changes in distribution.     In 1911 there was already serious overcrowding in addition to many defective houses, and changes in distribution of population were particularly marked during the &apos;:&apos;&apos;ar.MlHISTRY Oj?

Offices of the Cabinet, 2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1. 30th November, 1920.Dear Dr, Addison,The Finance Committee of the Cabinet met yesterday-afternoon for the pur nose of reviewing the general financial positiion of the country in the light of the most recent estimates of national revenue and expenditure.The Committee had under consideration various suggestions for economy submitted to them by the Chancellor of &quot;the Exchequer and among other proposals the Chancellor raised the Horsing question as follows:-Housina;:Every house built under the scheme of subsidy to Local Authorities, under which the Exchequer bears the whole cost over Id. rate, costs the Exchequer a sum which is not less than  50 por &amp;nnum, and may be as much as  75 per annum, for sixty years.-    The only limit at present is the hme limit (up to June 1922). It is suggested that a definite limit in the number cf houses (which would cover the existing commitments of Local Authorities), say, 100,000 houses, should be laid down for the Local Authorities&apos; subsidy scheme.As the Subsidy to Private Builders is much more economical to the Exchequer than the Local Authorities&apos; Subsidy, it ought to be the policy of the Government to rely on it, so long as any subsidies are considered unavoidable.As you will see from the enclosed extract from the Minutes of the Committee I was instructed to draw your attention to these proposals and to invite you to confer with the Committee in regard, to them.      At the same time I was directed to request you to furnish the Committee with your views on the desirability or otherwise of fixing a definite maximum sum to be expended within a limited period of time on the Local Authorities&apos; Subsidy scheme, and. also on the effect of the adoption of the proposals on the general policy of the G overnmen t re ga rd. ing ren t re s tr.i c ti on.I am not at present in a position to say definitely when the Finance Committee will resume the consideration of this subject, hut on the assumption that another meeting will be held within the next week perhaps you would think fit to supply the Committee at an early date with a memorandum dealing with the whole subject and particularly with the points specifically raised by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the.Committee.I remain,Yours very sincerely,(Sgd)       Li.P.A. HAHKEY.
