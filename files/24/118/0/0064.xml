2 46 2From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 005\hth January I921.(Received 1 p.hi.) *X,......the line,-      &quot;70 S.   Secret.   Afghanistan.   Following from Dobbs, dated 14th January: &quot;In view of necessity.-of opening discussions by confronting the Amir with information possessed by us regarding his relations with Russia and Jamal, it was decided that I should have private interview with Amir before formal negotiations began. 1 had nearly live hours&apos; discussion this morning with him and Tarsi, only other British representative present being Nawab. I communicated what we under-stand to be terms of Bolshevik treaty and direction of JamaFs activities. They seemed considerably agitated, and pressed for our source of information, which of course I refused. 1 explained difficulty of our proceeding with negotiations for friendship until this matter was cleared up. Amir completely led&apos; discussion on Afghan side, launched forth into discourse on (? failings) of whole British policy, and asserted that, whereas formerly Asia believed Russia to be enemy of Islam and Britain the friend, positions were reversed. This alienation of Islam was root of all our difficulties. We could retrieve our position by helping Afghanistan to become great Mussulman power and thus show that our quarrel with Turkey had been&apos; political, not religious. He dilated on importance of Afghanistan in world (? politics), and said if we made her our friend by a generous treaty, all doubt regarding Bolshevik treaty and other hostile factors would disappear. lie was not prepared to be given (? give) any more definite (seven groups omitted in transmission) I insisted that Amir (? was sent) greatly exaggerated idea of our difficulties, and that this general assurance- would scarcely suffice. Finally, Amir said he would discuss matters with advisers and decide whether definite reply could be given to my enquiry and whether he would take part in next meeting on 15th January. Amir specially asked about Persia, and my explanation of our main line of policy seemed greatly to surprise him (two groups undecypherable) probably did with information given him from&apos;Russian source.   We parted in perfect good humour.&quot;
