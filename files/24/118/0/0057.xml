*CONFIDENTIAL. -       tA Survey of Revolutionary Movements in Great Britain in the year 1920.In the annual survey of the year 1919 it was remarked that there is no subject on which it is more unwise to base forecasts : societies and individuals who are a menace to the community in one month may have disappeared three months later and the whole current of working class thought may be turned into a new channel. This has been borne out by the events of 1920, In December 1919 the air was full of discussions on nationalisation and nationalisation is dead, or at least in a state of suspended animation. In August the Councils of Action, which threatened to become Soviets, burst into view, and the Councils of Action are dead, or at least moribund. In December 1919 few people foresaw that the approaching year would close with a world-wide depression in trade and unemployment in every country.It would not, therefore, be wise to build too solidly upon the new-born tendency of Labour to blunder into the political field and coerce the Government into a change of foreign policy. This tendency marked the whole of tho past year and it may last well into the present year, for it is unfortunately the fact that a majority of working men believe that the formation of the Council of Action prevented the Government from going to war with Russia. Russia has not been their only pre-occupation. Ireland and, in a lesser degree, Egypt and India have been the subject of discussion, and the appetite for exerting a new-born sense of power is apt to grow. Nevertheless, it remains the fact that the British working man never takes much real interest in matters outside his own country, and this insular tendency can scarcely be overcome by agitators in the present generation. The worst permanent feature of the year has been a decline in the influence of Parliament.Labour has not come out very well in the matter of output.   Though the habit of slack work engendered during the Avar was wearing out toAvards the end of the year and the miners in particular were improving, statistics in industrial disputes show that only in February did the loss of working days due to strikes fall below half a million.   In October they reached the extraordinary total of 13,47-1,000, of which the miners were responsible for 12,800,000.   The output of the miners during the test period was 300,000  tons per week below that of 1913, although the number of men employed in and about the mines was over 1,100,000 as against 900,000 in 1913.   Revolutionary agitation was proved during the year to depend almost entirely on the supply of funds from abroad.   At the beginning of the year practically every society was either bankrupt or living from hand, to mouth.    Members of the Bolshevik Trade Delegation and their friends subsidised most of them, and the contribution to the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; ran into a very large sum.    It is essential, if Bolshevik trading representatives are to be accorded quasi-diplomatic privileges, that there should be legislation to restrain the subsidising ol revolutionary societies in this country.   The actual number of-&apos;class conscious &quot; communists who avouUI be prepared to lay down their lives for their ideals is probably under 30,000, but it is minorities Avho make revolutions, and the new system of communist organisation termed &quot; Cell&quot; &quot; Alveole,&quot; or &quot; Keimzelle &quot; according to the country involved, has been cleverly devised by the Russian  Commissaries for  the underground spreading of revolutionary doctrine.    This may prove to be far moreO  (33) AS 8013   Wt 17279-C 439  200  1/21  E &amp; S A
dangerous than the efforts of the various bickering groups who call themselves the Communists of Great Britain. It has hceu a remarkable fact that, in spite of visits to Russia by Labour men and communists, in spite of tho rather clever&apos; window dressing of the Soviets, there lias been a reaction throughout the country against Bolshevism on the Russian plan. Whether the leaders of British Trade Unionism really helieve in the Dictatorship of the Proletariat or not. all of them acted at times of crisis during the year as if thoy did. The more soher were driven into the Council of Action by the fear of being left out in tho cold, and if a crisis should arise during the next few months probably they will again follow the lino of least resistance.Trade Unionism has had its triumphs. The Triple Industrial Alliance has obtained important concessions of principle as well as advances in wages. The railwaynien have obtained representation on the Central and National Wages Boards and are on the road towards a share in the directorate, and the dockers secured a success at their Court of Enquiry. The miners, though but little nearer nationalisation than they were, regard their last settlement as a victory. They will fight very hard to retain what they have won, whatever may he tho pressure of the economic law of supply and demand. Meanwhile, if the jealousy of the constituent unions can be overcome, we are to see a General Council which will supersede the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress. We shall then have to deal with very large bodies, for the general workers, if they achieve fusion, will, with a membership of over a million, become the biggest single trade union in the world. The projected amalgamation of 19 unions connected with transport will add largely to the power of the Triple Industrial Alliance.The year 1920 saw the first striko of the &quot; black-coated brigade.&quot; The strike of the Insurance workers and the affiliation of the Journalists to the Trade Union Congress are significant.The year closed with almost unexampled unemployment. Perhaps, fortunately for this country, the phenomenon is world wide. Every country is hard hit, and it may be that if we keep our heads we may come through the crisis better than any of the others. Wc recovered from a worse economic position after the Peace of 1815, and if only sound economics could be more widely taught we should not appeal to the common sense of our people in vain.But widespread unemployment is the very condition on which the agitator thrives, and some simple form of legislation against sedition as has been adopted in other countries is a precaution that cannot he neglected without grave danger.

Mayors of 13  London  Boroughs requested Home    Secretary   to    reinstate    Police Strikers.- Divisional Conferences of Independent LabourParty at Cardiff and Eccles.The year 1920 opened inauspiciously. Talk of revolution way on every tongue and the efforts of the revolutionaries were concentrated upon welding political activity and industrial unrest into a weapon strong enough to overthrow tho Government. There was widespread discontent about high prices, profiteering, shortage of houses, and of domestic coal. In the mining and engineering industries the men were working &quot; ca&apos; canny,&quot; and on the railways &quot; working to rule book &quot; as a means of retaliation upon the Govern runt, while tho middle classes were saying openly that a Labour Party in power would be an improvement upon their existing rulers.Trade Unionists were beginning to take an interest in matters quit^ outside their industries. It was probably to this that the results of the Bromley and Speu Valley elections were due. Meanwhile, the revolu-tiouaries were opening up regular communications with the Soviet Government. Willis, Murphy, Hodgson, and Sylvia Pankhurst went to Holland for a secret meeting of Bolsheviks, at which the Western Europe Bureau of the Third International was subsequently formed and a mandate given for the formation of a Unitod Communist Party in Great Britain. Just before this meeting the members of the various revolutionary groups issued a referendum upon the formation of a single Party with a programme of: (1) Dictatorship of the Proletariat, (2) The Soviet System, (3) The Third International,(4) A referendum after three months on the question of affiliation with the Labour Party.A 2January  3rd 9th15thlQth-llth16th    -22nd.   -23rd    -24///.2Hth31sl
The proposal was defeated, more probably because of jealousy between the leaders and a dislike to the fourth point I ban because the majority had moderate views. There was a growing friction between Sylvia Pankhuist an I Theodore Rothstein. Tho former opposed Parliamentary action and affiliation with the Labour Party in spite of Lenin&apos;s reply to h or that &quot; Soviet propaganda can and ought to be carried on from within the bourgeois Parliaments.&quot; The rift widened and a feud botween the two branches of the Reds is still active. Throughout the month tho overthrow of the Constitution and the establishment of Soviet rule were openly advocated from revolutionary platforms all over tho country. The &quot;Hands off Russia&quot; Committee, subsidised by Russian money, sent circulars to six. hundred Trades and Labour Councils and received four hundred answers favouring direct action in the matter of peace with Russia. The Trade Union Congress attempted, unsuccessfully, to obtain passports for a delegation to Soviet Russia. At the end of the month George Lansbury obtained a passport to Scandinavia without revealing the fact that he intended to go to Russia. Ho visited Litvinoif in Copenhagen and, through the intervention of the Reds in Finland, got safely into Moscow.At this period Moscow was very much in the ascendant. The British Socialist Party declined an invitation from the German Independent Socialists to attend a meeting for founding a new International on tho ground that it was already affiliated to the Third. The anniversary of the death of Carl Liebknecht and Eosa Luxemburg was celebrated by the British revolutionaries.A National Conference of Shop Stewards&apos; and Workers&apos; Committees met at the International Socialist Club, claiming, without the slightest justification, to represent 76,970 workers. They passed the usual extreme resolutions, attacking not only the Government but Trade Unionism. Soon after this meeting the National Administrative Council decided to summon a &quot; Rank and File Convention&quot; to meet simul-taneously with the special Trade Union Congress and watch the proceedings of that body. The agenda, of which 4,000 copies were issued, proposed an immediate strike to secure, among other things, the abolition of Parliament and of trade unions in their existinsj form.The Independent Labour Party began to show signs of cleavage, some sections moving towards the Left and voting in favour of the Third International.Discontent among Ex-Service men assumed serious proportions. The National Union of Ex-Servico Men increased its membership and was recognised by the Labour Party &quot; as an ally in the work of our Party.&quot; The International Union of Ex-Service Men, which was particularly active in GlasgOAV, improved its organisation in East London and formed a branch in Bristol. ToAvards the end of the month the &quot;Daily Herald &quot; opened a mischievous campaign by alleging that men of the &quot;Z&quot; Reserve Avere to be called up.It is doubtful Avhether at this period the revolutionaries exceeded 10 per cent, of the total number of trade unionists. Nevertheless, certain Labour leaders such as Tom Mann and J. Bromley began to talk revolution within their unions. Throughout the month there was much more propaganda in favour of direct action, especially in regard to the nationalisation of the coalmines campaign. The miners&apos; leaders, with a Avholesome recollection of the lessons of the railway strike, became less bellicose and more inclined to propaganda. As the month Avore on, however, their discouragement became more marked, for although a majority of the miners, estimated in some quarters at 90 per cent., favoured nationalisation because they thought it meant transferring the
ownership of the mines to themselves, the general public refused to be converted. In the Midlands the miners became more revolutionary, and tho shortage of domestic coal and the alleged increased export of indus-trial coal at high prices added to the general unrest. On January 16th an attempt was made to prove that the price of industrial coal could immediately be reduced by 9s. id. per ton, and on the 28th a deputation presented to the Prime Minister a claim for such reduction followed by Government action to reduce the cost of living, or, alternatively, an advance in wages.The growing tendency of the rank and file to ignore the leadership of their officials Avas shown in the case of tho railwaymen and the moulders. A national conference of delegates of the National Union of Railwaymen first rejected and then accepted, in a slightly modified form, tho Govcrn-ment offer for the standardisation of wages and the provision of conciliation machinery for the settlement of future disputes ; acceptance was due to the fact that no other practical course was open, and the settlement was regarded by many of the rank and file as a purely temporary adjustment. Tho sliding scale, or, as it Was frequently termed, the &quot; fodder basis,&quot; evoked much hostile criticism from the officials of other trade unions, on the ground that it stereotyped existing conditions.The difficulties of the railwaymeu&apos;s executive, who from the first urged acceptance of the offer, were repeated in the case of the moulders&apos; strike, the men, contrary to the advice of their leaders, voting heavily against the proposals ; revised terms, drafted at a joint conference of employers and trade union officials were finally accepted by a majority-vote of 6,404, and the strike Germinated officially on January 26th. It bad lasted 18 weeks, and had seriously affected employment in allied industries.The Executive Committee of the Transport Workers1 Federation, after consultation with their partners in the Triple Industrial Alliance, decided to use peaceful methods in regard to the dockers&apos; claim for a minimum wage of 16s. a day. Miners and railwaymen alike intimated that their hands were full and the former laid stress upon the propaganda value of the Sankey Commission. A Court of Enquiry under the Industrial Courts Act Avas accordingly appointed to consider the questions of a standard minimum wage for dock and riverside woikers, overtime, and conditions of employment at the docks. On January 22nd a preliminary private meeting of the Court Avas held, under the chairmanship of Lord Shaw of Dunfermiine.
The month opened menacingly, with agitation about high prices and profiteering. The publication of the profits made in the woollen, tobacco, and sewing cotton industries caused great indignation and inclined the workers to listen to doctrines of class hatred. The Govern-ment was accused of protecting the trusts. In such a soil the seed of revolution germinated, and if it had not been for the failure of the stream of Eussian. money, the situation would have gone from bad to Avorse. The British delegates to the Bolshevik meeting in Amsterdam had expected to come back with full pockets, but the Dutch police broke up the meeting and they had to flee the country. There was, however, a va-et-vicnt of English revolutionaries to and from the Continent, and some money was received from Rothstein, but this barely sufficed for the salaries of the officials, and the yearly balance sheet of the British Socialist Party showed a loss, on &quot; The Call &quot; account alone, of 458/.On 10th February George Lansbury&apos;s first wireless message appeared in the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; ; a large section of the workers believed him to be honest and bis articles infused new life into the &quot;Hands off&apos; Russia&quot; movement and into the paper, which deepened its colour from pink to red. The necessity for Lansbury&apos;s journey was unwittingly emphasised by the statement of a member of the staff that the paper was heavily in debt. A &quot; Hands off Russia &quot; demonstration held in the Albert Hall on the last day of this month cost Rothstein about 500/. ; the money passed through the British Socialist Party, the intermediary being Rothstein&apos;s son, who was a Brackeubury Scholar at Balliol.

constant repetition, to an appreciative audience of East End aliens. At the request of Robert Williams the meeting sent a &quot; message of greeting &quot; to the French railway strikers who, however, bad already received more substantial backing from Rothstein, in the shape of 25,000 francs despatched to Loriot.The problem of parliamentary action constituted au obstacle which effectually blocked the way lo a united communist party ; the irreconci-lablcs in London and on the Clyde disregarded the commands of Lenin. But the British Socialist Party supported sabotage of the Labour Party from within, in the belief that the financial future of tho party and of its leaders was best assured by obedience to Rothsteiii.The moribund Shop Steward movement had a brief recovery owing to a statement by Lenin that be looked upon it as (he nucleus of a Soviet revolution in England.The grievances of ex-Service men, legitimate and imaginary, took the form of bitter recrimination against the Government ami its policy, particularly in regard to the discharges from Woolwich, which became a centre of unrest. Agitators, to whom patriotism in the ordinary course is merely a disease, were quick to exploit the situation and attempts were made to transform the rebel unions into a Red Army organisation. The membership of the National Union of Ex-Service Men increased rapidly to about 200,000 ; over 100 branches passed resolutions pledging themselves to take any drastic action demanded by the Executive in the ease o : the recall of Class &quot; Z &quot; ; &quot; an attempt to involve the country in another war&quot; ; or &quot; the occurrence of a. grave social and industrial crisis.&quot; Ex-Lieutenant George Nicholson, who had an extraordinarily bad influence in the Reading district, attempted the formation of a Sailors&apos;, Soldiers&apos;, and Airmen&apos;s Commune, which was to be affiliated to the Sailors&apos;, Soldiers&apos;, and Workers&apos; Committee.The National Federation of Discharged and. Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers which at this time time claimed to have over 1,000,000 members in 900 to 1,000 branches remained, as a whole, patriotic ; some groups, however, seceded to the revolutionary National Union of Ex-Service Men, while all were urged, in spite of the fact that the organisation was strictly non-political, to record their discontent with the Government by voting against it at bye-elections. A scheme for a great &quot; hunger march&quot; on London from the provinces was broached by the Federation. Some 400,000 ex-Serviec men were unemployed and the attitude of certain trade unions complicated the position ; the Labour Party urged that the reinstatement of ex-soldiers by their former employers should be made compulsory.The breach in the ranks of the Independent Labour Party grew wider, and the position of leaders such as Macdonald and Snowden was-vigorously challenged by the left wing, which was drifting from socialism to communism. Almost the only point of concord was opposition to the terms of the Peace Treaty, against which a special campaign was con-ducted, 800 meetings being held within a comparatively short period ; the Union of Democratic Control joined forces with the party.An indication of the revolutionary trend of labour Avas furnished by the monthly trade union journals, which began to devote considerable space to the inculcation of class hatred, and covered subjects ranging from profiteering to the &quot;Willy-Nicky&quot; correspondence. Revolutionary classes Avere increased and well supported, and lantern lectures became a successful feature of Bolshevik propaganda. The cost of living lent impetus to the propagation of Marxian economics, which Avere eagerly absorbed by the younger trade unionists.
Political activity on tho part of the unions continued. The &quot; Mines for the Nation &quot; campaign concluded on February 8th without having justified the expense or the effort incurred. The middle and lower classes generally were unconvinced, hut the miners wero prepared to strike if called upon, and their leaders made use of this fact in an attempt to intimidate the Government, The railwaymen, who were brought into direct opposition to tho general body of labour by their support of tho London Traffic Combines Bill, and the transport workers, however, showed no signs of joint action with the miners, who transferred the campaign from the country to Parliament by moving an amendment to the Address, regretting &quot; tho absence of any proposal to nationalise the coal mines of &quot; the country on tho lines recommended by a majority of the members &quot; of the Royal Commission on the Coal Industry.&quot; On February 19th the miners&apos; leaders met the Prime Minister and other members of the Government, and subsequently the independent accountants, but were unable to agree regarding the estimated surplus profits of the industry. In tho Welsh coalfields meanwhile revolutionary feeling was running high ; the unofficial Reform Committee talked of seizing upon a strike as an opportunity for setting up Soviets in every town in Wales. Arrangements were made with co-operative societies for supplies of food, and force was to be met with force. In the mon&apos;s own words, &quot;the rank and file will take command.&quot; Owing largely to the activities of A. J. Cook, who was elected miners&apos; agent for Rhoudda No. 1, &quot; ca&apos; canny&quot; was extensively practised in order &quot;to bring the tottering edifice of capitalism to the ground.&quot;The virus of nationalisation infected the seamen and, to a lesser degree, the railwaymen ; but more definite proof of labour&apos;s intention to attack the citadel of capitalism was found in the formation of Building Guilds, which sprang up in the North Western and Midland towns. Nationalisation as a theory, and it was still no more, had for years past figured on the agenda of annual labour congresses, but &quot; direct labour,&quot; as typified in the Building Guilds, was the first attempt by open competition with private enterprise to apply tho principles laid down by G. H. D. Cole and other labour intellectuals. Although the Guilds were composed mainly of trade union representatives, provision was made for the direct representation on the committee of administrative and professional elements.The rapprochement between the Labour and Co-operative bodies was strengthened, and a special congress, of the latter at Blackpool established a Parliamentary Committee and decided to appoint a full-time Executive of the Central Board to provide for &quot; propaganda, legal assistance, and co-operative education and defence.&quot; The Congress declared in favour of nationalisation of the mines, and a prominent official stated in reference to the Joint Advisory Boards : &quot; In future &quot; we shall be in a position to guarantee that any strike we may &quot; undertake must be successful.&quot;The introduction of the Home Rule Bill had resulted in an intensifi-catiou of Sinn Fein propaganda in this country and increased collections for the Irish National Loan, but much of the money subscribed adhered to the fingers of the collectors. A Labour-Nationalist Alliance in the House of Commons was mooted, but found only slight reflection in the constituencies, apart from Glasgow, where Sinn Feiners began to work themselves into official trade union positions. The training of Sinn Fein Volunteers was pushed forward in this district, and the local Irish Labour Party agreed to grant financial and moral support to the International Union of ex-Service Men. Ou 11th February a meeting which had been advertised by handbills distributed at every Roman
Catholic Church within a 25-mile radius of London, was hold at the Albert Hall, which was packed. Inflammatory speeches were made, and interrupters to the number of about 150 were ejected with considerable violonco. The meeting was claimed by the organisers to be excellent propaganda for foreign countries. A remarkable aspect was the absence of representatives of British Labour from the platform and the audience.MARCH.March  1st   -      -      -   Riot of Ex-Sorvice Men at WestminsterBridge.,,     5th 6th    -      -   Congress  of   International  Federation  ofTrade Unions in Amsterdam. ,,     1th ---   National Union of Ex-Service Men &quot; BackPay &quot; demonstrations. ,,     8th  -      -     -   Demonstration of   Transport  Workers atAlbert Hall in support of 16s. claim. ,,    1 Qth - National Conference of Miners&apos; Federationof Great Britain on nationalisation issue. ,,    I0th-I2th -     -   Rank and File Convention. ,,    Wtk -     -      -   Special  Trades  Union  Congress  decidedform of action to be taken to enforcenationalisation of the mines.

The
Profiteering Committees were adjudged valueless as it was &quot; useless to &quot; tinker with trivial cases, while the huge profiteering of combines cannot &quot; bo stopped at tho source.&quot;The Special Trades Union Congress, which met under the presidency of J. II. Thomas, M.P., on March 11th, had before it two proposals regarding the method of securing nationalisation : (i) Industrial action in tho form of a national general strike, (ii) Political action in the. form of intensive propaganda in preparation for a general election.The voting was as follows : (i) For-........1,050,000.Against -......   3,870,000Majority against.....2,820,000(ii) For........   3,732,000Against.......1,015,000Majority for......2,717,000The voting, therefore, dealt a severe blow to the direct actionists and demonstrated that the solidarity of the working classes, which the miners understood to mean all unions for one, had not yet been attained. But it did not indicate the end of nationalisation : the extremist miners merely changed their tractics and devoted their energies to a plan for making private ownership impossible by successive demands for increased wages, until the industry reached breaking point, and the capitalists accepte d nationalisation in preference to bankruptcy. The separate ballot of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain had yielded a vote of 524,000 for, and 346,000 against a strike for nationalisation, and on March 12th the resumed conference of delegates, accepting the recommendation of the executive, put forward an application for an advance of 3s. per shift for all members of the Federation over 16 years of age, and of Is. 6d. for those under that age, to date from March 1st. These claims failed to satisfy the South Wales revolutionary element, which in conference at Cardiff on March 22nd, reaffirmed tho demand for au advance of 21. per week. The South Wales Socialist Society was at this time corresponding with Lenin and Trotsky, who were impressed by the Welsh miners&apos; &quot;glorious fight for the proletariat.&quot; On March 24th the miners refused the Government offer of. Is. 6d. per shift, but continued negotiations ; the next day the .&quot; Daily Herald&quot; published an article alleging that the Government intended to blockade the coal miners, and had troops ready for this purpose. Although the statement was promptly denied in the House of Commons, incalculable harm was done, the men declaring that &quot; the Government dare not go into Court they would be shown up.&quot; The mouth ended, therefore, with feeling running strongly against the Government: a ballot was in progress ; a national miners&apos; strike seemed possible, and a sectional strike in South Wales probable.The Bank and File Convention, on which the revolutionaries based much hope and which, with abysmal ignorance of western nations, Zinoviev subsequently described as &quot; the most important event in the history of the proletarian movement of the whole world,&quot; was postponed to the evenings of March 10th, 11th, and 12th, in order to synchronise with the Trades Union Congress. Fourteen delegates were appointed to form propaganda Committees, under the title of &quot; District Soviets,&quot; in various
2parts of England ; they were instructed to conduct their own affairs, draft their own rules, compile lists of local machinery and keep obsorva-tion on supplies in shops, stores, and mills. This scheme was one after Lenin&apos;s own heart and received his blessing ; although not in itself destined to become of much moment, it was typical of those dissensions in Labours own ranks which most frequently found vent to rabid campaigns against the steadier leaders. In many unions tho ranks and file showed a tendency to revolt a noteworthy instance being that of the railway men at Crewe, who in defiance of Mr. Cramp&apos;s official instructions, caused very serious congestion by &quot; working to rule.&quot; In order to counteract the &quot;cumbersome and reactionary trade union machinery.&quot; Vigilance Committees of &quot;rebel&quot; members were instituted in various industries. ,The formation of these district Soviets startled the various other extremist groups into a revival of the bickerings which they termed unity negotiations ; the Socialist Labour Party refused to make any concession whatsoever, while the Workers&apos; Socialist Federation was adamant in its opposition to parliamentary representation ; consequently the British Socialist Party decided to form a communist party of its own before Sylvia Pankhurst could do so. The latter was, at the moment, obsessed with what she called &quot; Social Soviets &quot; a movement intended to organise the workers in their homes as distinct from their places of work.George Lansbury returned to Russia and was given a noisy reception at the Albert Hall ; he had concluded an agreement with the Soviet Government by which he was to receive from Frederick Strom, the Bolshevik agent in Sweden, 500 tons of paper, then valued at 25,000/., free of charge. He had also made arrangements for the &quot; Daily Herald&quot; to receive material for publication from the Soviet Government; consignments of Bolshevik literature were at this time being sent to the United Kingdom, via, Norway and Holland.The unrest among ex-service men at Woolwich who for some time had been drifting under extremist influence, culminated in an attempt to reach Westminster in procession on March 1st. Rioting took place when the police stopped the men on the South side of Westminster Bridge ; the casualties were comparatively slight, but serious ill-feeling arose from the incident, and threats were made of another demonstration which the men would attend armed with bombs and other weapons. On vhe same day the National Union of ex-Service Men began a campaign for &quot; back pay &quot; at Colonial rates which Avas to be raised by confiscation of the land. The prospect of receiving a considerable sum of money appealed to the men, and the scheme was nominally supported by the Labour Party, who hoped thereby to secure the Ex-Service men votes.It became clear that international labour relations, both industrial and political, were to be resumed ; British delegates attended Trade Union Congresses in Holland and Norway and a conference of revolutionaries at Strasburg, while the seamen, who were balloting on the nationalisation of the shipping industry, launched a comprehensive international programme. The British Transport Workers contributed 1,000? towards the support of the strike of Dutch dockers and transport workers.Although the railway men as a whole were fairly steady, the London extremists, headed by Foot, set to work to perfect their strike machinery by the formation of a &quot;Central Strike Committee&quot; in constant session in London.
The industrial situation was unsatisfactory throughout the month, for, although the miners accepted the Government terms by a majority of 65,135 in a vote of 820,273 on 15th April, disputes arose in other important unions, such as those of the engine drivers, railwaymen, cotton operatives, and transport workers. In spite of the fact that the basis of the claims advanced was economic, as distinct from political, UDrest was largely the work of the revolutionary minority which had captured the brancb and lodge machinery. Soviet Russia was fomenting revolutionary movements in England and on the Continent, and considered strikes &quot;the best means of overthrowing the capstalist system.&quot; Tchitcherimvwas in touch with the South Wales syndicalists and decreed that financial aidApril 3rd-     -     -   First Animal Conference of National Union of ex-Sorvice Men at Birmingham. ith-5th  -      -   Annual Conference of British Socialist Party in London.,,     ith-6th  -     -   Annual Conference of Independent LabourParty in Glasgow, ,,   11th -     -      -   First Annual Conference of Irish Labour Partyat Gateshead.

should bo given to the Rhondda Valley miners by the &quot; English Com-munist Parly &quot; ; the Soviet Government was particularly anxious that Robert Smillie, whom they regarded as one of their most powerful allies, should go to Moscow. In brief, it became obvious that although the great majority of trade unionists had neither the wish nor the intention to foment revolution, each strike or threatened strike was used by the agitators as a means to that end, and could no longer, therefore, be regarded as purely industrial. The South Wales and the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners&apos; Federation polled heavy majorities in favour of a strike, and South Wales evinced a desire to break away from the national federation and profit from higher district rates instead of allowing the industry to be subsidised at their expense. For the same reason this coalfield advocated immediate de-control.On April 21st a joint meeting of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, the executives of the Labour Party and the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, and representatives of the co-opera-tive movement decided to refer to the Labour Party the question of how to cany out the new nationalisation campaign ; the estimated cost of this was 20,0007. to 30,000/., whereas the expenses of the first had been only 5,000/.Growing dissatisfaction with their recent settlement led the railway-men to put in a claim for an advance of 1/. per week for all grades, and back it by a threat to extend the practice of &quot;working to rule book &quot; to the whole country. The London District Councils, whose duty Foot declared to be the promotion of discontent, were particularly active and demanded that the Triple Alliance should support the Irish workers then on strike. The wages claims of the railwaymen were frankly stated to be, based upon the advances secured in other industries. The Railway Clerks&apos; Association formed a London and District Political Advisory Council in order to facilitate working arrangements between the Associa,-tion and the Labour Party. The Associated Society of Locomotive Enginemen and Firemen put forward a fresh demand for an all-grade advance in permanent wages.Schism in the Labour movement reached its zenith : the leaders disputed politeal and industrial questions ; the rank and file abused their officials indiscriminately ; and the feud regarding the Third International was waged in the press and ou the platform. A section of the Socialist Labour Party seceded and demanded separate representation at the &quot; Unity &quot; negotiations ; the &quot;Socialist&quot; declared that the Independent Labour Party was &quot; a political dog&apos;s breakfast and such a diet the working class of this country can never digest.&quot; That party, which was notorious for its manipulation tactics, attacked the block vote system and complained that &quot; one of the Third International Federations had &quot; gone the length of attempting to secure a block vote of all the branches &quot; attached to it.&quot; Jealousy between different unions was immeasurable ; the railwaymen declared they were worth as much as the dockers, while the unskilled trades claimed that the dockers were also unskilled. Lancashire miners looked covetously at the spinners&apos; wages and even the police were said to be weighing their new scale of wages against the advances to manual labourers.The annual conference of the Independent Labour Party made a great stir in the Lahour world and resulted in a temporary victory for the moderates, since it resolved, by 529 to 144 votes, to w.thdraw from the Second International, but rejected, by 472 to 206 votes, the proposal to affiliate with the Third. The National Administrative Council waa instructed to get into touch with the Swiss Party with a view to the re-establishment of an &quot;all inclusive&quot; International, which would allow autonomy to each nation, subject to the adoption of a common socialist
objective. This last decision infuriated the extremists, who were in the pay of Lenin, and declared that autonomy would moan the repudiation of &apos; the disciplined and centralised action of the workers of all countries,&quot; or, in other words, of Moscow&apos;s dictatorship. One result of tho conference was tho despatch in May of a questionnaire to the Third International.The British Socialist Party also held its annual conference atBothnal Green under the presidency of Councillor Vaughan, the local Bolshevik mayor. The speeches were frankly revolutionary, as were the resolutions. Albert Inkpin, taunted by John McLean with being in the pay of the British Government, replied that every penny came either directly or indirectly from the Soviet Government to him, and that be handed it to Theodore Rothstein. The executive of the British Socialist Party took steps to warn Lenin that McLean was insane. Rothstein was at this time paying a weekly subsidy of 20/. to the Glasgow Socialist Information and Research Bureau, and II. 10s. per week to Walton Newbold and his wife to lecture Independent Labour Party branches. Practically all the extremist societies were in debt, and were only saved from bankruptcy by Russian money. Sylvia Pankhurst wrote urgently to Sweden for help for tho Peoplo\s Russian Information Bureau, which had only funds sufficient &quot;to keep it going for about a week,&quot; as, in consequence of her quarrel with Rothsteiu, the subsidy of 40/. a month had been withdrawn. Despite the rising cost of paper and the shortage of money, this month saw a remarkable increase in tho output of extremist literature. The various journals contained long lists of new books and pamphlets, and three now monthly periodicals appeared in London. Further, &quot;The Vanguard,&quot; which had been suppressed during the war, was revived by John McLean ; the &quot; Call &quot; increased its size from eight to twelve pages, and &quot;Solidarity&quot; increased its circulation from 9,000 to 10,000. Tho &quot;Daily Herald,&quot; which had been borrowing paper wherever possible, received 333 bales from Gothenburg.Industrial conscription in Russia had somewhat lessened the popularity of the &quot; Hands off Russia &quot; movement, as Lansbury discovered when he toured the provinces on behalf of Soviet Russia. Accordingly he wrote to Litvinoff urging him to procure a statement to the effect that &quot; the &quot; dictatorship of the minority is only a temporary business. . . . &quot; People on this side are trying to argue that a new governing class &quot; has arisen in Russia, and that you will become simply a kind of clique, &quot; with the mass of the people objecting to obejing your orders. In &quot; effect, of course, this is true, but it is only a transitional business, and &quot; it wants saying in an authoritative way by one of you that this is so.&quot; On 28th April the British Labour Delegation, representing the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress, left this country to make &quot; an u independent and impartial inquiry into the industrial, political, and &quot; economic conditions in Russia&quot;; the delegation, which was accoin-panied by newspaper correspondents, was composed as follows : Ben Turner   -      -      -      -   The Lai our Party, Chairman of delegation.A. A. Purcell II. SkinnerMargaret BondfieldEthel Snowden Tom Shaw Robert WilliamsThe Labour Party.R. C. Wallhead Clifford AllenChas, Roden Buxton L. Haden Guest
On April 24th the British Socialist Party, Workers&apos; Socialist Federation, and the &quot; rebel&quot; section of the Socialist Labour Party held another &quot;unity&quot; conference; they were unable to compose their differences regarding parliamentary action and affiliation with the Labour Party. The official Socialist Labour Party was not represented, and the left wing of the Independent Labour Party did not reply to the invitation to attend.The First Annual Conference of the National Union of Ex-Service Men at Birmingham was attended by 120 delegates, who endeavoured to surpass each other in violence of speech ; beyond the decision to par-anticipate in the International of Ex-Servicemen, little business of importance was transacted. On April 18th a very large demonstration of ex-service men, organised by the National Federation of Discharged and De-mobilised Sailors and Soldiers, was held in Hyde Park and passed a resolution protesting against the Government attitude to the men, asking for increased pensions and demanding an inquiry into the action of the police during the demonstration of March 1st. On April 25th at a conference in Cardiff delegates representing 25,000 members of the Welsh branches of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobi-lised Sailors and Soldiers and the Comrades of tho Great War passed similar resolutions. Resentment against the employment of women in offices and tramcars resulted in rioting by ex-service men in Bristol, while in Glasgow they threatened to wreck cars carrying recruiting posters.Extremists had exploited the discontent among the blind with such success that a inarch to London from all parts of the country was under-taken. About 250, amongst whom were a few ex-service men, reached London on April 24th and held a demonstration in Trafalgar Square on the following day.The membership of the Irish Self-Detcrniinatiou League increased considerably during April&apos;and attained a total of nearly 10,000; the first week of the month was marked by several memorial services for the victims of the Easter rebellion. On April 11th Arthur Griffith and Eoin MacNeill addressed a Sinn Fein demonstration of about 5,000 people in Glasgow, and on April 18th Malone spoke at a large Glasgow demonstration which protested against &quot; the oppressive military rule in Ireland.&quot; Rioting occurred between the police and &quot;B&quot; company of the Irish Volunteers at Glasgow, owing to tho refusal of the former to allow a meeting to take place in George Square on April 28th. The estimated number of Sinn Feiners in the Glasgow district at this date Avas 90,000 and the membership of the Irish Volunteers just over 10,000; of these 1,233 Avere armed. In this area the Irish had con-siderable hold on trade unions, especially in the unskilled trades, but elsewhere, especially in ports, there Avas a good deal of friction betAveen the English and Irish Avorkers. The first annual conference of the Irish Labour Party decided that that body should not affiliate Avith any other organisation. The huuger strike of Irish prisoners in WormAVOod Scrubs gave an impetus to Sinn Feiners in London, who demonstrated outside the prison, while on April 27th a deputation of Irish dockers informed the Lord Mayor of Liverpool that if the three Irishmen arested locally Avere not released within 48 hours the Liverpool dockers would strike. The strike began on April 29th.Throughout the month the unrest arising from the cost of living continued and various unions contemplated a strike to force the Govern-ment to bring down prices. The prospect of increased rents added fuel to the fire, which threatened to,assume the proportions of a national conflagaration.

May Z\st  -     -     -   Sub-committeo of Triple Industrial Alliancerequestod that a special Trades Union Congress bo called to consider Labour&apos;g attitude towards handling munitions for Ireland and Poland.The celebration of May Day, for which unprecedented preparations had been made, passed off without disturbances ; the provincial demon-strations were comparatively small, except in Glasgow, but in London the procession was imposing and constituted a gigantic advertisement for the co-operative societies and a lesser one for the &quot; Daily Herald.&quot; Although the demonstration in Hyde Park was the largest ever seen in London, it was a disappointment to the revolutionaries, since there were about 750,000 organised trade unionists in the area and not more than 50,000 participated. Speeches, largely in praise of Soviet Russia, were delivered from 12 platforms. A comprehensive resolution was then moved, which covered : housing and slums, transport, amnesty for all military prisoners, employment, endowment of motherhood, equal pay for men and women, universal pensions, abolition of the Aliens Restriction Act, State support and control of the blind, high prices and control, recognition and support of the co-operative movement, withdrawal of troops from Ireland, the &quot; atrocities of capitalist governments every-where,&quot; solidarity of the workers of all countries and affiliation to the Third International, and peace with Soviet Russia. About 8,000 people paid Is. &apos;6d. each for real revolutionary thrills at the Albert Hall in the evening. The main resolution recorded the intention to &quot; continue with &quot; ever-growing intensity the age-long struggle for the establishment of a &quot; new and better social order,&quot; while an impromptu resolution in support of Soviets for Britain, moved by Sylvia Pankhurst, was passed by a show of hands. In Glasgow the demonstrators numbered about 10,000 and were addressed from 24 platforms. Practically all the local firebrands spoke, while the resolution demanded the overthrow of the capitalist system, the establishment of the Co-operative Commonwealth, and the withdrawal of troops from Ireland, and hailed the Soviet Republic. The numbers attending demonstrations in other parts of the country varied from a few hundreds to 3,000. The extremists were annoyed with the co-operators, whose vans predominated in most of the processions, for weakening the &quot; spirit and moral &quot; of the movement, and complained that &quot; May Day should not be a masquerade, but a summons to battle.&quot; On the other hand, some of the co-operators objected to the alliance of the two movements, and a large society in Lancashire deferred making a grant of 300/. towards the Parliamentary funds of the Co-operative Party, as a protest against the demonstrations.The Polish offensive gave a new lease of life to the &quot;Hands off Russia&quot; movement and proved useful propaganda to the extremists, who endeavoured to prevent the despatch of munitions to Poland. In the case of the S.S.&quot; Jolly George &quot; they were successful, the stevedores and coalies refusing to work unless a quantity of guns and ammunition were removed from the ship. The &quot; Daily Herald &quot; did its best to make mischief with an article entitled &quot; Vultures gathering round Russia Commons silenced while plot is rushed forward,&quot; iu which the alleged activities of Poland, Japan, Roumania, Finland, France, America, and England against Russia were recounted. The British Socialist Party had 200,000 copies printed of a statement from the Kieff Workers&apos; Committee regarding the air bombardment of that town by Polish forces ; 100,000 of these were sent to the &quot; Hands off Russia &quot; Committee for distribution. This Committee o AS 8613 b
issued a circular to all Trades Union branches and Trades Councils urging them to pass and transmit to the Polish Legation resolutions protesting against the &quot; wanton attack &quot; on Russia and threatening a national strike. London extremists devoted their attention to the Polish Legation, which it was suggested should lie burnt down, and a series of demonstrations was held in Grosvenor Square, most of which were addressed by Malone. On May 29th some 1,500 persons attempted to reach the Legation, but were stopped by tho police, and on the next day a baud of 100 revo-lutionaries, under the leadership of Sylvia Pankhurst, met with a similar fate. On May 18th the triennial conference of the Dockers&apos; Union instructed its members to withhold their labour if ordered to assist in any form of intervention against Russia ; the railwaymen&apos;s and general workers&apos; federations decided on similar action, and the miners resolved to exert pressure on the Government to &quot;cease support of Polish intervention.&quot;The Labour Delegation to Russia, some members of which had promised active support of Soviet Russia by sabotage, direct action, or otherwise, was interviewed by Lenin on May 26th. Francis Meynell left this country on May 21st in order to visit Rotterdam, Berlin, and various towns in Scandinavia on behalf of the &quot; Daily Herald.&quot;The Russian Trading Delegation arrived during the month, and, with the exception of Krassin, who gave a verbal promise, signed a written undertaking not to interfere in the politics or internal affairs of this country, or to interview representatives of the Press. Rothstein attached himself to the Delegation soon after its arrival.Tanner and Beech, the shop stewards, were at this time in Russia, and the British Socialist Party was agitating for passports for William McLaine and Tom Quolch, for whose expenses Rothsteiu gave Inkpin 300/. It was considered by the British Socialist Party that their trip to Russia would greatly improve the status of the party from an inter-national point of view.During the month the position of the communist negotiators was complicated by a statement from the Amsterdam Sub-Bureau of the Third International in which affiliation with the Labour Party was discouraged. The Socialist Labour Party, now described by &quot;The Worker&quot; as a &quot;hotbed of self-righteous cant and nauseating hypocrisy,&quot; considered the moment opportune for the issue of a manifesto in which it declined to participate further in the unity negotiations except upon &quot; clear and distinct revolutionary lines wherein the Proletarian Revolu-&quot; tiou stands clear and clean from compromise.&quot; The&apos; Scottish Shop Stewards&apos; Committee appealed to the Executive of the Third Inter-national for a &quot; loan &quot; of 1,000/. for &quot; The Worker.&quot;The National Guilds League, which comprised most of the young intellectuals of the Labour movement, appointed a special committee, including Norman Ewer and William Mellor, respectively Foreign and Industrial Editors of the &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; to obtain from the British Socialist Party particulars of the Soviet system. This action was a sequel to the annual meeting, at which a resolution was passed asserting that the firm establishment of Guild Socialism was impossible without the supersession of the capitalist state by forms of organisation created by, and directly expressing the will of, the workers themselves. The resolution welcomed the Soviet system as complying with that condition.Acting on instructions from Moscow, the communists turned their attention to the Army, and Harold Burgess, the business manager of the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; was arrested and convicted for attempting to cause disaffection among the Irish Guards at Caterham.  He supplied
9 ^?U v wcertain Guardsmen with copies of the pamphlet &quot;Soviets for the British&quot; and gave them money.On 1st May the International Congress of Ex-Service Men opened at Geneva under the presidency of M. Henri Barbusse, who was subsequently elected general secretary. A. E. Mander and Alexander Scott, of the National Union of ex-Service Men, represented Great Britain ; and French, Italian, Belgium, Swiss, and German organisations also sent delegates. By the terms of tho charter adopted, these associations undertook to carry on intensive pacifist and anti-militarist propaganda and to work for an international general strike on mobilisation being declared in any country ; they condemned the Leaguo of Nations as a league of capitalist governments. A resolution in. favour of affiliation with the Third International was strenuously opposed by the British, German, and some of the French delegates, and it was eventually agreed that each national organisation should do as it wished.The National and International Unions, backed by the Workers&apos; Socialist Federation and the Herald League, started a campaign against recruiting for the Territorials ; Bristol ex-Service men continued their disorderly conduct until the police forbade further processions.The Triple Alliance considered the cost of living, and resolved to join the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, the Labour Party, and the Co-operative movement in making an exhaustive inquiry ; resolutions demanding that a special Trades Union Congress be called to formulate a policy for the reduction of prices were passed by trade union branches. An indication oh the policy of Labour was given in a resolution passed by the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners ; this called for a levy on wealth, the abandonment of all militarist and imperialistic schemes, drastic reduction of expenditure on armaments, the communisation of land, railways, coal mines, and shipping, and the immediate revision of the Peace Treaty.The Triple Industrial Alliance, which had proved a feeble instrument in the disputes of the previous six months, overhauled its machinery at a meeting of full executives on 6th May. Provision was then made for more frequent meetings of the full executives and of the sub-committees, but the railwaymen&apos;s proposal, that the basis of the Alliance should be broadened to permit the inclusion of other unions, was defeated.On May 1st an unofficial &quot; work to rule&quot; strike of railwaymen began, and attained importance in some districts. But as the strike entailed the loss of overtime pay it was not popular, and came to an ignominious end on May 30th.A large number of periodic trade union conferences was held during the month. From these emerged the outstanding fact that &quot; control &quot; had become the slogan of the moment, replacing that &quot; recognition&quot; which had been the watchword in Trade Union circles a few years ago ; and definitions of &quot; control,&quot; had they been obtainable, would probably have ranged from guild socialism to communism. The consideration of political questions, particularly those affecting Russia and Ireland, figured prominently in the proceedings of these conferences. The refusal to handle munitions for Poland had reacted upon the situation with regard to Irelaud. For instance, the railwaymen at North Wall, Dublin, by refusing to deal with military stores or troops, created an impasse which sorely tried the ingenuity of the National Union of Railwaymeu. The difficulty was passed on to the Triple Alliance, and was then by that body referred to the Trades Union Congress. Considerable importance attached to the annual congress of the Co-operative move-ment, which was held at Bristol; for the best brains in the Labour movement had realised that labour, in destroying capitalism, runs the riskb a
of self-destruction, and can only hope to succeed if hacked by co-operative food and money. A resolution proposing an alliance, for political and electoral purposes, of the Labour Tarty, Trades Union Congress, and Co-operative movement Avas accordingly moved, but a decision thereon was postponed until next year, greatly to the chagrin of the promoters.The Labour Party devoted itself chiefly to spade Avork in the con-stituencies, and started a &quot; two-million shillings &quot; fund to meet increased expenditure ; district conferences were oiganised with a view to the co-ordination of municipal policy. The London building-trade operatives adopted the broad principles of the Building Guild scheme, and on May 27th issued a preliminary prospectus of a similar scheme for themselves.The Industrial Workers of the World in London, to whom were attached temporarily the Colonial agitators Kavanagh and Gage, Avere joined by Barker and Ross alias Rosenthal, two extremists Avho had been deported from Australia to Chile during the war. These men agitated, in pairs, for the release of the revolutionaries imprisoned in Canada and Australia.The &quot; Daily Herald&quot; appealed for financial support which Avould enable it to start a Northern edition in Manchester. The weekly loss on this neAVspaper, which in November 1919 had &quot; fallen &quot; to 1,400/., had uoav risen to 2,200/., and the total of trade union investmeuts Avas Avell under 100,000/. Although the circulation Avas stated to be betAveen 400,000 and 500,000 daily the printing capacity of the press only slightly exceeded 300,000 copies.   403 more bales of paper arrived from Sweden.Sinn Fein efforts Avere concentrated on an attempt to induce the Trade Unions to refuse to handle arms, ammunition, and troops for Ireland. The Workers&apos; Socialist Federation and the Herald League espoused the Irish cause, but Avere successful only among the converted. The Liver-pool dock strike proved a fiasco, and aroused ill-feeling among the leaders and members of local trade unions ; friction between the English and Irish elements increased, and there Avas considerable difficulty in avoiding a clash. Although Sean McGraith had called off the demonstrations at WormAvood Scrubs OAving to the opposition and disturbances, some 9,000 people met at GlasgoAV on May 2nd to demand the release of the prisoners. Sinn Feiners drilled in the public park at Bothwell, and arms and ammunition Avere smuggled to Ireland in.small quantities. Brawling among Sinn Feiners occurred weekly in the Glasgow area, and on May 29th twenty-one people were arrested and six policemen injured, At the annual general meeting of the Gaelic League, held in London, the membership Avas said to total 1,100, as against 466 in 1919 : the credit balance for the year amounted to 257/.

of revolutionary feeling ; t\\o month differed from its predecessors in that the possibility of industrial action by tho whole of the labour movement to bring down prices was seriously discussed. A conference of labour, socialist, and trade unions organisations considered the question in Man-chester and London, and urged various remedies, including a levy on capital and the removal of restrictions on international trade ; they also declared that &quot; no permanent solution of the problem of prices can be &quot; found until production, distribution, and credit arc controlled by &quot; organised labour,&quot; and advocated the &quot; supersession of the capitalist system by the Co-operative Commonwealth of International Socialism.&quot; The Special Committee of Inquiry appointed by the Trades Union Congress, the Labour Party, and the Co-operative movement to in-vestigate the cost of living and to make recommendations for its reduction appointed a sub-committee to work out detailed plans for investigation; this body met subsequently and decided to institute special inquiries as to food, clothing, coal, transport, housing, and raw materials, and in this connection to investigate the effect of prices on taxation ; scarcity, natural and artificial; transport disorganisation ; wages and industrial unrest; financial operations, other than currency, standards and rates of exchange, and lioating debt; and Government control and its effects. The Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Bill inflamed the minds of the working classes, and a campaign was started, especially in Scotland, against the clauses under which rents could be increased. Efforts were made by the Glasgow Labour Housing Association to organise a 24 hours&apos; general strike and periodical trade uuion demonstrations. The Labour Housing Association, at a national conference in the Essex Hall, roundly condemned Government policy on this question, and called upon the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress to organise a campaign against it. The extremists seized upon this, as upon every other grievance which could be exploited, and on June 27th 5,000 people attended a &quot; no rent&quot; demonstration in Glasgow, which was addressed by John McLean and other revolutionaries. Tenants&apos; Defence Leagues were formed in the North of England. The Building Guilds, meanwhile, were making progress, and sanction had been given for 51 building schemes, which involved the employment of &quot; direct labour &quot; ; the largest scheme was that of the Birmingham Corporation, which covered 500 houses.The annual conference of the Labour Party was of more importance than many of its forerunners, because, in addition to the perennial resolutions, Russia, Ireland, and Hungary figured on the agenda. The test question was put by the British Socialist Party, which moved, as an amendment to the resolution proposing secession from the Second International, affiliation to the Third.   The result of the voting was : Secession from the Second International: Against - - - - - 1,010,000 For......516,000Affiliation with the Third International: Against.....  2,940,000For.....-     225,000There is little doubt that this result was affected by the circulation of LemVs letter to British workers, which the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; had abstained from printing until it was paid for as an advertisement. This letter, which betrayed an almost incredible misconception of public opinion in England, and suggested that a revolution should be engineered in order to obtain proofs of Lenin&apos;s assertions regarding British foreign
policy, was chiefly remarkable for its attack on the recognised leaders of Labour ; it established beyond doubt tho fact that tho unceasing cam-paign of calumny to which the moderate officials had been subjected was inspired from Russia. The above voting at the Labour Party conference furnished some indication of tho numerical strength of the revolutionaries in the kingdom, but was entirely misleading as to their influence. The best illustration of this fact may be drawn from tho Independent Labour Party, which, with a total membership of 45,000, had 706 members on municipal councils, 90 on educational authorities, and 379 on boards of guardians and parish councils. In tho opinion of tho professional revolutionary the majority of apathetic or even antagonistic workers is of less importance than the live minority.On June 11th the largest sum investod in the u Daily Herald &quot; by any trades union changed hands, Frank Hodges paying iu 38,500/. for 5 per cent, debenture stock. A few days previously, however, Lausbury, Meynell, and other members of tho &quot;Daily Herald&quot; entertained the Russian Trading Delegation at lunch, and important negotiations for the subsidy of the paper by Soviet Russia were then discussed.Although the bi-weekly meetings in Grosvenor Square gradually dwindled, the &quot; Hands off Russia &quot; Committee, which was in touch with and received money from the Russian Trading Delegation, entered on a period of intense activity. The objective was a national strike of at least 24 hours to enforce peace with Russia ; the Committee, however, fell foul of the Transport Workers&apos; Federation, which objected to tho subversion of discipline implied in a manifesto which urged all trade unionists to down tools. The return of the trade union leaders, Ben Turner and Tom Shaw, and the publication of the interim report of the Labour Delegation to Russia, had, however, considerable effect ; the former proved, in virtue of their official positions, useful pro-Bolshevik propagandists, while the latter demanded the recognition of the Soviet Republic and the raising of the blockade, &quot; matters of special urgency,&quot; omitting, for the time being, any adverse criticism of the Bolshevik regime.The Communist negotiators continued to disagree, and on June 19th Sylvia Pankhurst further complicated matters by forming, with tho assistance of a band of revolutionaries from various parts of England, the &quot; Communist Party (British Section of the Third International).&quot; A provisional committee was set up to. work for three months. Having achieved this nominal transformation of the Workers&apos; Socialist Federa-tion, Sylvia Pankhurst, who was in very low financial water owing to her quarrel with Rothstein, applied for a visa to Norway, intending to go to Russia for funds. The party proceeded to draw up and circulate a programme of 57 articles, which were of importance in that they con-stituted the most complete declaration of Bolshevism ever made in this country. They covered the objects of the Party, which include the establishment of Communism on a basis of Soviets for workers, soldiers, sailors, mothers, and the professions, the introduction of communal house-keeping, the socialisation and free use of houses, transport, post and telegraph communication, and universal free education until the age of 20.   Article 42 declared that : &quot; The Army, Navy, and Police Force created under capitalism, and all who belong to the rauks of the black army of capitalism, shall be disarmed. A workers&apos; Red Army and Navy shall be created. All trusted workers who have had military training shall be armed, and all workers shall be trained to fight, if necessary, in defence of the Workers&apos; Revolution.&quot;
This Communist Party believed that the revolution would be accomplished by industrial mass action, sabotage, and the general strike, leading to armed insurrection, and therefore pledged itself to &quot; organise to seize control of production,&quot; to &quot; carry on propaganda in the Army &quot; and Navy to wean the workers from their allegiance to tho Capitalist &quot; State . . . ,&quot; and to &quot; urge the workers to boycott tho police force.&quot; Finally, the Party affirmed its solidarity with Soviet Russia by declaring that &quot; the sole leader of the proletariat for freedom is the Third International.&quot; The formation of this party aroused a hurricane of abuse from the negotiating groups, and the most complimentary term applied to the action was &quot; sabotage.&quot;This month afforded additional testimony to the revolution in Trades Unionism, for tho officials, although occupied in many cases with wages claims, devoted equal attention to the home and foreign policy of the Government, and endeavoured to creato among their members a feeling in support of direct action for political purposes. A majority of the railwaymen were disposed, as a result of their experiences in the 1919 strike and the &quot; work to rule &quot; strike of May, to accept the award of the National Wagos Board, but the union was greatly divided on the question of Ireland. The Glasgow District Council demanded the resignation of the National Executive, which, unable to reach agreement on the Irish question, insisted that it was a matter which could be handled only by the trade union movement as a whole. For the same reason the Executive withdrew the embargo on munitions for Poland, and on June 3rd the Dublin members of the Union were ordered to return to work &quot; in order to give the Labour movement an opportunity of acting on their behalf.&quot; Delegates of the Irish branch of the Union met the executive in Bristol, but did little more than pass a resolution, subsequently laid before the Prime Minister, to the effect that the outrages in Ireland were the inevitable result of the Governments failure to govern Ireland in accordance with the wishes of the Irish people. It was also requested that the despatch of munitions and troops to Ireland might be discontinued until after the special meeting of the Trades Union Congress on July 13th. At this time the National Union of llailwaymen endeavoured to make a stand against the continual demands made on it for sympathetic action in industrial disputes, the Executive deciding that it was &quot;not the function of a single trade &quot; union to be the custodian of the other trade unions until the trade &quot; union movement organised itself along the lines of creating a fighting &quot; fund to meet the expenses of any union or group of unions who &quot; might be involved in disputes necessitating the withdrawal of &quot; labour.&quot;The transport workers, meanwhile, were also concerned with matters extraneous to their union, devoting a considerable portion of their annual general meeting to the affairs of Hungary and Ireland. As was the case with the railwaymen, however, they shirked individual responsibility, and, after hearing statements by representatives of the Irish Trades Union Congress and Labour Party, and considering a communication from the secretary of the International Federation of Transport Workers on the subject of the boycott of Hungary, refened both questions to the special Trades Union Congress. One of the Irish representatives committed a tactical error and alienated sympathy by threats of cutting off food supplies and derailing troop trains.There was some dissension among the miners at the beginning of the month. South Wales had returned a majority against the proposal to double contributions, thereby threatening the disintegration of the national body.   As a result, however, of intensive propaganda organised by the
officials, this decision was reversed by a subsequent ballot. The annual conference of the South Wales Minors&apos; Federation lived up to tho reputation of the coalfield by passing a resolution to amend the rule governing a national strike that a bare instead of a two-thirds majority would be sufficient to warrant a national strike. It was resolved to tender notice of the total abolition of piece work for all grades in the coalfield, and it was further decided that the time was long overdue when the question of the high cost of living should be seriously fought : &quot; For &quot; that purpose we ask that continuous increases of wages be sought for, &quot; counterbalancing the effect of high prices.&quot; The conference asked that industrial action be taken unless prices were reduced by August 1st. The special conference of the national federation on June 10th agreed to defer a new wages claim until after the annual conference in July, but, meanwhile, to examine the data relating to the finances of the industry, which Avere about to be published by the Coal Controller. South Wales strenuously but unsuccessfully opposed the postponement of the wages claim.Returns made available during this month showed that 2,729 trade union branches were banking with, the Co-operative Wholesale Society, au increase of 1,354 since September 1919. The most important account was probably that of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, which had invested over 170,000/., or considerably more than one-third of its total funds.

Ireland became the predominant question with trade unionists during this month, and there is reason to believe that it was a ballon (Vcssai. The Russian Trading Delegation had used every opportunity of studying the British Labour movement, and the events of July were a useful indication of the strength of tho various factions. On July 13th the special Trades Union Congress, which had been called to consider policy in regard to ihe Irish, Russian, and Hungarian questions, dealt in effect with the first only ; the railwayinen&apos;s resolution, which advocated a truce and the withdrawal of troops from Ireland, was carried by 1,953,000 to 1,759,000 votes ; the miners&apos; resolution, which demanded the withdrawal of troops, the cessation of the production of munitions destined for use against Ireland and Russia, and recommended a general strike if these demands were not conceded, was also carried by 2,760,000 to 1,636,000. This vote was, more than anything, a sign of the irritation of the workers against the Government; an individual ballot would have been necessary before the resolution could have been acted upon, and this would almost certainly have gone against a strike. A deputation from the Parlia-mentary Committee subsequently presented the resolutions to the Prime Minister and then endeavoured to bury them with as little publicity as possible.On July 11th a demonstration was held in the Albert Hall to welcome the Labour Delegation on their return from llussia ; with one exception the speeches were violent, and a resolution was passed calling for peace with Soviet Russia. Five of the depntaliou lost no time in proving their gratitude for Soviet hospitality by issuing a manifesto inciting the rank and file of the trade union movement to direct action, as they had &quot; been compelled to realise that no force of parliamentary action &quot; will induce the British Government to give up its policy of trying to &quot; strangle the Soviet regime.&quot; The special Trades Union Congress on July 13th had passed a resolution in which it was declared, inter alia, that &quot; any attempt of a clandestine nature to secure the suppport of the &quot; British democracy in order to give military assistance to Poland, is &quot; foredoomed to failure.&quot; The significant point is that this resolution was moved and seconded by two members oi the returned Labour Delegation, and in the light of after events it is clear that it was an important knot in the net which Moscow was weaving round the British trade union movement. The Russian Trading Delegation had, mean-while, concluded a bargain with the ,(Daily Herald &quot; by which the paper became virtually the English organ of the Soviet Government ; the subsidy was apparently obtained by a threat on the part of Lansbury that otherwise the paper would have to turn &quot; Right.&quot; A series of messages, some of which were subsequently published, passed during this month between Tchitcherine, Litvinoff and Klishko ; these proved that Meynell had received a considerable subsidy for the &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; and that Moscow had acquired at least temporary control of the paper, and was making use of it &quot; for purposes of information and agitation.&quot; Examination of the paper further showed that from July 16th to August 17th, at least, the Delegation supplied diplomatic information which would not otherwise have been available.Apart from the activities of the Delegation, however, the Bolshevik Government ga^ e proof of its interest in this country by the despatch, nominally from an &quot; All Russian &quot; Trades Union, of a message to the Marconi operators then on strike. The following passage was typical : &quot; The Soviet Power has introduced all over Russia a four hours&apos; labour &quot; day for wireless operators. Protest, therefore, against your terrible &quot; exploitation by the Marconi Company. Strike and strike hard. &quot; Destroy the rotten foundations of the capitalist world.&quot;  Moscow also
replied, during this month, to the Independent Labour Party question-naire of May 25th. Tho Executive Committee of the Third Inter-national with unusual modesty stated that it was not the business of the International &quot; to indicate the exact form in which the revolution is to develop,&quot; but added that tho British workers must prepare, not for an easy parliamentary victory, but for victory by civil war.On Juno 18th 1920 the Second Congress of the Third International opened at Petrograd, was transferred to Moscow, after the session of inauguration, on July 21st and closed on August 7th ; the British dele-gates who left this country surreptitiously were Ramsay, Beech, Tanner, and Murphy (Shop Stewards), Gallachor and Clarke (Scottish Workers&apos; Committee), Sylvia Pankhurst (Communist Party, British Section of the Third International), and Connolly and MeAlpine (Ireland); Tom Quelcb and W. McLaine were also present on behalf of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Margery Newbold was probably present for part of the proceedings only. After hearing reports on the progress of Bolshevism in foreign countries the congress resolved itself into com-mittees to draft resolutions on the following subjects : The part to bo played by the communist party in proletarian revolution,.both before and after the seizure of power by tho proletariat; parliamentarism, pro-fessional trade unionism ; national and colonial questions, agrarian questions ; conditions for admission to the Third International; and the international situation and the work of the Communist International. That part of the Congress which most nearly touched Great Britain was the discussion of the conditions of admission to the Third International, which resulted in the &quot; Twauty-one Points &quot; subsequently sent to and published in this country.The Communist Unity negotiators, who by this time called them-selves &quot; the Joint Provisional Committee for the Communist Party of Great Britain,&quot; had referred their troubles to Lenin by letter on June 20th ; on July 10th they received from him a wireless message in which he &quot; entirely sympathised &quot; with their plan for &quot; one sole Communist Party&quot; in England, condemned the tactics of Sylvia Pankhurst, and stated that ho personaliy favoured participation in Parliament and adhesion to the Labour Party &quot; under the condition of reserving entire freedom and independent Communist action.&quot; A significant passage concluded the wireless : &quot; I consider as most desirable the rapid organisa-&quot; tion of one Communist Party ou the basis of all the decisions of the &apos;* Third International, and also the bringing of that party into closest &quot; touch with the Industrial Workers of the World and Shop Stewards&apos; &quot; Committees in order to unite completely with them in the nearest &quot; future.&quot; In view of Lenin&apos;s predilection for parliamentary action it is of interest to note that Malone definitely threw in his lot with the British Socialist Party at this juncture and agreed to represent that party in the House, though elected as a Coalition Liberal. His con-version was rapid, for within a few days he expressed the hope that if he left Parliament his return might be &quot; with the Red Guards at the time of the Revolution.&quot; Malone&apos;s position among the communists was from the outset that of military adviser, although he has also acted as a mouthpiece of Russia in the House.The boycott of Hungary by the International Transport Workers&apos; Federation, which began on Juue 20th, was the subject of negotia-tions between the Hungarian Government and the International Federation of Trade Unions, in which an English representative partici-pated. On July 3rd and 4th a report of the negotiations was presented to a meeting of the Bureau of the International Federation,, who issued a manifesto which contained four political as against two
industrial stipulations. This occurrence emphasised the increasing com-complexity of the relations between politics and labour in international as well as in national spheres.Considerable activity prevailed in the extremo organisations of ex-Service men. The Bristol branch of the International Union of ex-Service Men organised a march of its members to London, which began on July 14th ; the marchers were welcomed at a Trafalgar Square demonstration by the Communist Party (British Section of the Third International) on July 25th. An assault on a Union Jack in Hyde Park indicated the disloyalty of the National Union of ox-Service Men and resulted in a fracas during which seveu people were arrested. The National Union of ex-Service Men&apos;s headquarters circularised all branches in support of tho proposed &quot; No Rent &quot; strike, suggesting that the strike should continue until the cost of living had fallen to 100 per cent, above pre-war level.The campaign for a &quot; No Rent &quot; strike made great progress in the Glasgow area ; several important trade unions, including tho Lanarkshire Miners&apos; County Union and the Scottish Divisional Council of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation pledged their support to the Scottish Labour Housing Association, which, in conference on July 31st, decided that August 23rd should be the day of the 24-hours&apos; strike.The Co-operative directors officially circulated a resolution in which they declared themselves opposed to the alliance between the co-operative and labour movements proposed at the Bristol Congress ; they further refused to sanction the use of the Co-operative Wholesale Society&apos;s funds for political purposes. Nevertheless, a further step towards co-operative and labour co-ordination was made when, on July 27th, a meeting of representatives of the three bodies decided to appoint a sub-committee to draft a detailed scheme for joint working as regards publicity, the collection of statistical and other information and legal advice.The annual conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain decided to adopt the proposals of the Executive that a demand should be made to the Government for au immediate reduction of 14s. 2d. in the price of domestic coal and for a wages advance of 2s., Is., and 9d. per shift for men, boys between the ages of 18 and 16, and below 16, respectively. The conference confirmed previously expressed opposition to the Ministry of Mines Bill and declared that it would &quot; refuse to operate it, should it become law.&quot; A proposal to empower the executive, in the event of a national dispute, to call a national strike without a ballot, was defeated. The conference devoted considerable time to discussion of the Irish, Russian, and Hungarian questions, passed a resolution calling upon the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to grant the appeal of the Winnipeg strike leaders, on whose behalf Kavanagh and Gage had been agitating.Before leaving for the International Miners&apos; Congress at Geneva the miners&apos; officials, who had put forward the demand for a reduction in the price of coal partly as proof of their competence to &quot; control&quot; the industry and partly to placate the rest of labour and the general public, at once set to work to consolidate their position. They wrote privately to members of the Transport Workers&apos; Executive, urging them in the event of a strike only to handle coal for hospitals, and negotiations witli the Amalgamated Engineering Union were expedited ; a form of working agreement was drawn up, the principle being that where members of either organisation were engaged in an industry, the organisation catering for the industry as such would control all workers in it. This was a distinct advance along the road towards industrial unionism, the goal of most of the extreme Trade Union leaders. Of far greater importance in this connection, however, was the fusion of engineering unions, which
became effective ou July 1st ; the Amalgamated Engineering Union was the culmination of efforts which had been in progress sinco 1914, and represented the unification of 10 of the chief unions in the industry. Tho dominating factor was the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, which after existence as an individual organisation for 70 years had a membership of 320,604. The new union had a membership of about 460,000 and funds of about 4,000,000/. which gave it a stronger financial position than any other individual labour body. Tom Mann became general secretary and the new constitution covered divisional and national committees, which allowed for the control of policy by the rank and file ; shop stewards were also more fully recognised under the new rules.The Industrial Court, which on 29th June, in connection with the four-monthly review of wages in the engineering and shipbuilding trades, had heard claims for a general advance of 6d. per hour for journeymen time workers and equivalent advances for piece workers, decided that the claims submitted had not been established. Sectional trouble occurred almost immediately, thousands of boilcnnakers striking at Middlesbrough, Stockton, and Darlington, while the Lancashire engineers at once placed a ban on overtime ; the communists, many of whom were drawn from the ranks of the engineers, inaugurated a fresh campaign against the authority of the Trade Union officials and exploited these unofficial movements, endeavouring &quot; to be on the spot whenever spontaneous :revolts occur, doing vital propaganda and endeavouring to comnmnistically educate discontent.&quot;The agenda of the annual delegate meeting of the National Union of Railwaymen, which was held in Belfast, indicated once more the change which Trade Unionism was undergoing, and included resolutions on the Irish and Polish question, the attitude of the executive towards the Labour Colleges, working arrangements with the Co-operative Wholesale Society, and investments in the &quot; Daily Herald.&quot; The award of the National Wages Board was accepted, after a good deal of opposition, by 42 to 18 votes.Feeling was running high among the textile workers, who had rejected by ballot the employers&apos; counter proposals to their claim for an increase in wages of 50 per cent. The annual meeting of the United Textile Workers&apos; Association unanimously resolved to recommend the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the position of the cotton industry and the conditions prevailing therein.Although sectional antipathy between British Labour and Sinn Fein became increasingly marked, agitators, particularly in the Glasgow area, made the most of the &quot; Hands off Ireland &quot; campaign. John McLean, with a few of his disreputable lieutenants, started a new movement entitled the &quot; Tramps&apos; Trust Unlimited,&quot; which aimed at assisting Sinn Fein in every possible way; 100,000 copies of the leaflet &quot;Pioposed Irish Massacre,&quot; which concluded &quot; Scottish workers, start a general &quot; strike to prevent a civil war and a world war,&quot; were distributed by the &quot; Trust,&quot; which, however, appealed only to the hooligans who comprised McLean&apos;s usual following. Several&apos;collisions between Sinn Feiners and Orangemen occurred in Glasgow, but the Boyne celebrations passed off without friction. On July 18th, however, a free fight took place at Manchester between Sinn Feiners and some Englishmen who interrupted at a meeting ; the police were forced to make a baton charge, and one man was arrested. A number of Sinn Fein meetings, some of which were addressed by Mrs. Sheehy Skeffington and Sean Milroy, were held throughout the country, and the Irish Self-Determination League grew in membership and in branches.

The causes were two-fold; genuine fear of conscription and artificial agitation directly controlled from Moscow by means of the Russian Trading Delegation. At the beginning of the month the &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; having the advantage of close association with the Delegation and the opportunity of increasing its funds from Russia by faithful service to the Soviet Government, was able by skilful perversion and suppression of news to work even moderate trade unionists into a surprising state of excitement. The Russo-Polish situation was exploited to the full by the Labour Press and by the extremists, and a war, in which Great Britain would be involved, was believed to be a matter of days only; on August 6th Arthur Henderson, M.P., sent a telegram to all local labour parties directing their attention to the gravity of the sitaation and urging them immediately to organise public demonstrations against military intervention and against the supply of men and munition to Poland. Eight Labour Members of Parliament and other labour leaders issued &quot; An Appeal to the British Nation,&quot; in which it was stated that British Labour would&apos;not assist Poland against Russia. On August 9th a meeting representing the Labour Party, the Parliamentary
Labour Party, and the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, which had been summoned by the respective secretaries of those bodies, was held in the &quot;House of Commons and a resolution was passed in which it was declared that the conference &quot;feels certain that &quot; war is being engineered between the Allied Powers and Soviet Russia &quot; on the issue of Poland, aud declares that such a Avar would be an &quot; intolerable crime against humanity. It therefore Avarns the Govern-&quot; ment that, the Avhole industrial power of the organised workers will be &quot; used to defeat this Avar.&quot; Tho resolution further advised the executive committees of affiliated organisations throughout the country to hold themselves ready to attend a national conference and to instruct their members to down tools on instruction from tho conference. It Avas also decided immediately to constitute a &quot;Council of Action &quot; to give efect to these decisions. The following were appointed to serve ou the &quot; Council of Action &quot; : Representing the Parliamentary Labour Party : W. Adainson,J. R. Clynes,J. 0&apos;Grady,John Robertson, and colonel Wedgwood.Representing the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress : Harry Gosling,A. A. Purcell,A. Swales,R. B.

The conference endorsed the formation of the Council of Action and authorised it to order any form of strike considered necessary * to secure, not only the prevention of Avar against or support for the enemies of, Soviet Russia, but the recognition of, and unrestricted trading relations with, the Bolshevik Government. &apos;o  as 8618 o
The Council of Action remained in continuous session and interviewed not only the Prime Minister, but the Russian Trading Delegation ; in fact, its policy may be said to have beon dictated by that body, even to the extent of the lino taken in certain manifestoes. The Council of Action, the formation of which was quite clearly the work of professional and foreign revolutionaries, was, in essence, a central soviet and was in conflict not only with tho constitution of the country, but with the laws governing trades unionism.&quot;Tho Council is entrusted definitely with the executive power to call out at a momcnt&apos;s notice and without question this or that section of tho labour movement. It can organise, and is prepared to organise, complete control of foreign policy, and of that domestic production and distribution of commodities which, in the last resort, determines policy.&quot;One of the salient features of the &quot; Council of Action &quot; was the fusion, for the time being, of the left and right leaders of labour. This was quickly reflected throughout the country, for branch officials, what-ever their convictions, hastened to assist in the formation of focal councils of action, which were charged to deal with strike arrangements and questions of supply and transport. The communists, who were jubilant at the turn of events, hailed the local councils as important links in the chain of revolutionary development, but obtained at first little represen-tation thereon. Their formation was the signal for a very rapid increase of revolutionary sentiment, and the spirit of revolt grew daily. August 22nd, when &quot;Peace with Russia&quot; demonstrations were held throughout the country, was a gala day for the revolutionaries, and some of their speakers showed signs of intoxication ; in Trafalgar square the attendance was estimated at 15,000. Audiences during the month became bigger and bigger both in London and the provinces, the speeches were increasingly violent, meetings closed invariably with the singing of the &quot; Red Flag,&quot; and enormous quantities of literature were distributed. The steadier branch officials were forced to dance to Red tunes, and in eases where they did not recant their former professions, their positions became untenable.In proportion, however, as the local councils advanced the national council receded, owing partly to the progress of military events in Poland and partly to the fact that the amateur British revolutionaries, who comprised the national council, wjre unable to make the most of the opportunity on which their professional Russian confreres had so cleverly seized. As the last week of August approached, the extremists christened the central body the &quot;Council of Inaction,&quot; and the &quot;Hands off Russia&quot; Committee became the main centre of activity. Certain trade unions, however, took exception to a circular in Avhich the Committee advised the miners to hold up coal for France. This circular, which had been issued in accordance with instructions from the Russian Trading Delegation, Avho were trying to drive a wedge between England and Prance, was &quot;translated as au undue interference with the executive rights of trade unions,&quot; and was resented by the &quot; Council of Action.&quot;The incessant intrigues of the Russian Trading Delegation proved to have become a great menace to the stability of the country ; in addition to being in daily communication with the &quot; Council of Action,&quot; &apos; they subsidised not only the &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; but &quot;The Communist&quot; (formerly &quot; The Call&quot;) and the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; and engineered through Rothstein the formation of tho Communist Party of Great Britain.   Without their help the extremist organs might well have
disappeared, just as tho Communist Party of Great Britain would probably not have come into existence, and the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; would have been in imminent danger of collapse. By the consummate ability with which they exploited the fear of mobilisation the Delegation made August the most disturbed month of the year.It is worthy of record that the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; published two Sunday issues during the month, one of which urged an immediate general strike on behalf of Russia. The paper was, however, severely hit by the revelations of its subsidy from the Soviet Government after it had loudly proclaimed that it had received &quot;Not a bond, not a sou, not a rouble.&quot;August 31st and September 1st saw the birth of the second and most important Communist Party, surnamed &quot;of Great Britain.&quot; Some 151 delegates representing 220 groups of extremists, mostly British Socialist Party branches, adopted in conference tho principles of the Soviet system, dictatorship of the proletariat, communism, and adhesion to the Third International. The meeting further declared in fauour of parliamentary action and affiliation with the British Labour Party, and elected a Committee consisting, among others, of Maloue, Mellor, Iukpin, and MacManus. Rothstein may take the credit for such unity as was here achieved rince he supplied the funds. Tho danger of this party lay not in its numerical strength, which probably did not exceed 17,000, but in its avowed intention &quot;to fan the already existing llames of &quot; discontent, to foment revolt, and finally to bring about revolutionary &quot; action. To every struggle of the masses it will seek to give a &quot; revolutionary purpose and meaning.&quot; The party, however, not content with the exploitation of industrial unrest, turned its attention to the Lower Deck, and urged its members to spread &quot; revolutionary propaganda and Soviet and Communist ideas in the Navy.&quot; On August 8th the Executive Committee resolved to apply to the Labour Party for affiliation, but to enclose with the application a statement of the objects, methods, and policy of the Communist Party.During August the British Labour Delegation to Russia issued a final report ; it was an apologia for, rather than a vindication of, Bolshevism.. The growing unemployment of ex-Service men led to much bitterness, which on August 29th found expression in a revolutionary demonstration in Trafalgar Square ; Robert Williams, who described himself as a &quot; friend and colleague of KamenefF,&quot; urged the ex-soldiers to send their propagandists to the &quot; barracks of the Horse, Foot Guards, Artillery, &quot; Cavalry, and Police, and secure them as members of the National &quot; Union of Ex-Service Men.&quot; Delay in linking up the extension of unemployment pay also caused a good deal of irritation among ex soldiers. On August 12th some 300 men marched under the auspices of the West London branch of the International Union of Ex-Service Men to Hammer-smith and demanded redress of their grievances from the mayor ; and similar scenes occurred at Leicester.The campaign against the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act culminated in a 21-hours &quot;No Rent&quot; strike on August 23rd, in which it was estimated that 300,000 Scottish workers participated ; demonstrations against the Act were held in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Leith, and Dundee, but, in spite of these, the Act was put into force with very little violent opposition.As the month wore on the threatened miners&apos; strike loomed large on the horizon and overshadowed the artificial disturbances created by thec 2
&quot; Council of Action.&quot; On August 30th tho result of the Miners&apos; ballot was declared to be : There were considerable minorities against a strike in Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire, while the majorities in favour were heaviest in North-umberlaud, Lancashire and Cheshire, and Forest of Dean. A meeting of the Triple Industrial Alliance on the following day resolved that the constituent bodies were unanimously of opinion that the miners&apos; claims were &quot; both reasonable and just and should be conceded forthwith.&quot; The National Union of Scottish Mine Workers decided by ballot in favour of a five day working week. The International Miners&apos; Congress, which sat at Geneva from August 2nd to 5th, elected Frank Hodges as secre-tary ; Robert Smillie was already president, and, of the 148 delegates attending, about one half wero British. The Congress unanimously resolved to declare a universal general strike in the event of a future war menace and to press for nationalisation of the mining industry.There was much discontent among the engineers, and while the officials recommended a termination of the agreement whereby the wages of the industry came under four-monthly review by the Industrial Court, the unofficial movement gave strength in Lancashire, where the ban on overtime was maintained and extended. The Manchester District Com-mittee decided to resign in preference to complying with the order of the&apos; National Executive to remove the ban. A crisis threatened to arise from the Penistone dispute owing to the decision of the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federation to lock out all members of the Electrical Trades Union.Considerable activity was manifest within the co-operative movement. About 130 delegates attended a &quot; Left Wing &quot; conference at Derby, at which a resolution attacking the policy of the directors was passed. Determined efforts were made by extremists in various parts of the country to capture the co-operative machinery, and in Nottingham 70 active members succeeded in pledging the local societies, with a member-ship of 18,000, to support fusion with the labour movement. On August 30th the Central Board of the Co-operative Union decided that the question of active association with the councils of action should be left to the discretion of the local co-operative societies.        *Interest in the Russo-Polish situation forced the Irish question iuti the background, but the arrival of Dr. Mannix created some excitement, particularly in Liverpool. The hunger strike of Terence MacSwiney, Lord Mayor of Cork, aroused much feeling in Sinn Fein circles and demonstrations of several thousand people were held outside Brixfon Prison at the end of August. The temper of the demonstrators was ugly, and reprisals against members of the Government were freely threatened.For a strike Against- 605,782- 238,865Majority for-   367,917
After a few weeks of abnormal activity the national Council of Action had subsided into a position of comparatively negligible import-auce ; its more moderate members, who in August had been stampeded into the extremist camp through fear of losing their trade union positions, returned to moderation, and the resulting inactivity of the council caused the Russian Trading Delegation to transfer their attention to the &quot; Hands off Russia &quot; Committee. The Polish Socialist Party addressed to the British Labour Party a communication in which certain charges were made against Soviet Russia, and in consequence the Council of Action, which, met at Portsmouth on September 5th, appointed Messrs.

the Russo-Polish negotiations; passports were,however,refused. While certain ineinliers of the national Council declared that it had only one objective, i.e,, peace with Russia, the local councils proceeded to dig themselves in and to extend their ramifications. Lambeth, for instance, advocated the establishment of a Civil Guard, of which the nucleus should be the National Union of Police and Prison Officers, while Merthyr openly proclaimed that its function was &quot;the organisation of industrial workers to function in time of crisis,&quot; and, together with Rhondda, adopted a wide constitution, based on Soviet principles. Stratford arranged privately with the local Co-operative Society that the whole resources of the latter be placed at the disposal of the local councils immediately the expected crisis arose ; the seizure of the stocks of merchants and private traders was also discussed. On September 10th it was stated that over 300 local councils were in existence, the majority of which considered themselves to be Soviets, and were ready for revolution of even the most sanguinary kind. The &quot; Hands off Russia&quot; Committee, alive to the fact that, whatever the failings of the national body, the local organisations were genuinely revolutionary, endeavoured, unsuccessfully, to promote a national conference of local councils. The threat of a miners&apos; strike, which distracted attention from the national council, caused the communists to concentrate on the perfection of the local machinery which they intended to employ if the strike broke out.W. P. Coates, national secretary of the &quot; Hands off Russia &quot; Com-mittee, drew up a circular addressed to troops in the occupied area, and tried to obtain the signatures of six Avell-known labour leaders ; Tom Mann signed unconditionally, but J. Bromley, of the Associated Society of Locomotive Eugineinen and Firemen, agreed to the use of his name only if four others signed : the circular urged the troops not to consent to be used against Russia. On September 28th it was decided to move the secretariat of the &quot;Hands off&quot; Russia&quot; Committee from Manchester to London, and to form, if possible, a joint national committee in conjunction with the Communist Party of Great Britain. This body, meanwhile, had received from the Third International the conditions upon which the communist parties of various countries would be allowed to affiliate ; these decreed, inter alia, &quot;illegal action,&quot; &quot;propaganda and systematic and increasing activity among the troops,&quot; &quot; persistent and systematic &quot; propaganda inside the Trades Unions, the Co-operatives, and other &quot; working class organisations,&quot; &quot; iron discipline similar to military discipline . . . during the actual period of acute civil war.&quot; About the same time, as was not surprising, the Labour Party refused the communists&apos; application for affiliation. The party organisers, after the formation of the Communist Party of Great Britain, spread over the provinces and openly preached revolution by violence ; in several towns, however, the speakers crossed the path of Sylvia Pankhurst&apos;s disciples and exchange of abuse occurred. Both groups fastened upon unemploy-ment as the most profitable topic, and urged the workers &quot;to assume &quot; responsibility for the control of the resources of the country which is &quot; theirs, and for the administration of the means whereby they live.&quot;On September 20th, Sylvia Pankhurst returned from Russia, bringing with her a sum of money, hut, in common with the other visitors to Moscow, instructions to form a united communist party within four months ; owing to the quarrel with Rothstein she had not obtained from Lenin as much as she had hoped. Most of the money went to the Communist Party of Great Britain, but Sylvia was also in close touch with Errki Veltheim, the Bolshevik courier, Avho had for some months been one of Lenin&apos;s principal agents in this country. Altogether it was now estimated that some 100,000/. of Russian money had been spent in
revolutionary propaganda in this country during the year, much of which was devoted to the free circulation of literature. The Socialist Inforina-tion and Research Bureau, for instance, had been in receipt of a weekly subsidy of 20/., and the weekly gratis distribution of extremist literature in the Glasgow area reached nearly 1,000,000 copies.This month witnessed the birth of two more communist parties. On September 11th sonic 150 extremists, representing 21 groups, met in Glasgow and formed the Communist Labour Party of Great Britain,&quot; and during the next week the South Wales and West of England Communist Party was formed at Cardiff. Tho latter was almost identical, and retained close liaison with Sylvia Pankhurst&apos;s group. These parties were not welcomed by tho revolutionaries, who were struggling back from Russia, somewhat bedraggled and crestfallen, because Lenin had proved himself a hard taskmaster, demanding value for money spent and discipline from his followers. The primary condition which he laid down to all was that they sjiould form one united communist party for the whole country, to be presided over by a Russian. On the whole these delegates seem to have returned wiser as well as sadder, for a note crept into their speeches intimating that, although they approved of tho Soviet system for Russia, some modification would be necessary in application to Great Britain. It is also possible that they left Lenin a wiser man, for they were as frank about each other in Russia as they were in their home organs. The formation of the various parties was, nevertheless, followed by a marked increase in violent speeches ; the agitators, gaining courage from their immunity, openly incited their audiences to crime and violence.On September 25th and 26th the Communist Party (British Section of the Third International) held a secret conference at Manchester, at which Zinoviev\s thesis of the Third International was accepted and plans laid which, had they been more than verbiage, would have plunged the country into revolution within a month.Considerable efforts were made during September to undermine the loyalty of the Forces. The National Union of Ex-Service Men was particular)&apos; active in various garrison towns, and delegates to the Trades Union Congress at Portsmouth made a point of enlisting the sympathy of the Lower Deck for the miners and of pointing out ways in Avliich sailors&apos; organisation could be improved. On September 17th the first ease of seizure of a hall occurred at Harlesden, where some 200 members of the International Union of Ex-Service Men attempted to hold a meeting in the local Labour Exchange ; when the police were called in, they left quietly, although it was believed that some of them carried arms. The National Union of Ex-Service Men and the International Union of Ex-Service Men now began to organise marches to and from their meetings, at which they were addressed in the most violent terms and taught to regard themselves as a section of the &quot; Red Army.&quot; On September 30th a deputa-tion of the latter body interviewed the Marylebone Council and urged that a special distress fund might be raised to meet the growing unemployment-ployinent. The National Union of Ex-Service Men was at this time balloting on the questions of decentralisation and fusion with the extreme labour organisations ; they claimed to have held 29,000 meetings since January.Unemployment, especially amoug ex-Service men, reached an acute stage at Coventry, upon Avhich the communists focussed their attention ; an unemployment committee called the Soldiers&apos; and Workers&apos; Council organised marches to the most important works, where meetings were held to enlist the sympathy of those men who still had work. The leaders were anxious to approach the Russian Trading Delegation with a
view to ascertaining and supplying some of the needs of Russia by means of a factory taken over by the civic authorities.Tho effects of the exposure of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; became more apparent. The circulation suffered a further drop, and the paper was discredited among the steadier trade unionists ; a most significant instance was the refusal of the National Union of Railwayman to invest their promised 20,000/. On September 24th Ernest Beviu issued a second appeal for funds, in which he complained that the whip of the previous November had produced only 90,000/. of the required 400,000/. ; he revived the bait of a Manchester edition, which would cater for the Northern workers, but broke the news that owing to the weekly loss (subsequently stated to be 3,000/.) the price of the paper would be raised to 2d. per copy. The Labour Research Bureau, which undertook a good deal of propaganda work in industrial crises, also complained of debt at this juncture, tho loss on the year&apos;s working amounting to 1,000/. During the month the Central Labour College, now known as the Labour College, decided to purchase property at Kew at an initial cost of 21,000/., in which more than double the existing number of students could be accommodated. The College is the fountain head of Marxian teaching in this country, and is responsible for the training of more dangerous revolutionaries than all the communist parties put together.The small Debt Courts in Scotland became gradually overtaxed with business in connection with disputes between landlords and tenants over increases in rent. Numbers of Lanarkshire miners declined to pay the increase and refused to leave their houses. Councillor Shiuwell, who had been one of the pioneers of the &quot;no rent&quot; campaign, became a test case.Considerable activity prevailed in Sinn Fein circles during the month, owing to the hunger strike of the Lord Mayor of Cork and tho presence in this country of Dr. Mannix. Feeling in Glasgow ran very high, violent speeches being made in which the British Flag was described as the Hag of murder, militarism, ,rapine, and arson, and the Royal Irish Constabulary designated hooligans, professional thieves, and guttersnipes with bad Army records. The continual influx of young Irishmen into this area was the cause of lawlessness, faction fights of Irish&apos; partisans occurring daily ; similar conditions obtained at Liverpool, where the Sinn Feiners and Orangemen were with difficulty kept apart.On September 8th the joint committee appointed to investigate the increased cost of living issued an interim report for presentation to the Trades Union Congress; the committee found that the high cost of living might be assigned, primarily, to currency expansion, and not to under-production, and that the chief remedy would therefore be to deal with the inflation of currency in this and other countries, and to deflate it, where possible, to an extent which would eliminate the depreciation of currency in terms of gold.The annual meeting of the Trades Union Congress, which sat at Portsmouth from September 6th to 11th, had before it, in common with most Labour conferences, resolutions and amendments covering, not only the whole field of the movement, but matters as apparently inconsequent as the relations between marine bandsmen and civilian musicians, and the overcrowding of omnibuses and tramcars. The most important resolution on the agenda was that relating to the General Staff for Labour, which was adopted ou a card vote by 4,858,000 to 1,767,000. This resolution proposed a transformation of the Parliamentary Com-mittee in regard both to functions and composition ; the duties of the Parliamentary Committee, as defined in standing orders, were &quot; to give &quot; assistance when it is desired to take a legal action of general interest

A decided increase of revolutionary feeling among the delegates, avIio with one exception made no attempt to Avith-stand extreme views, Avas noticeable.   It seemed clear that the power of&quot; to trade unionism as a whole to the House of Lords, and to watch &quot; Parliamentary elections&quot; : it is now decided that in addition to these duties the Committee, which will be termed tho General Council, shall-(1) keep a watch on all industrial movements and attempt, where possible, to co-ordinate industrial action ; (2) Promote common action by the trade union movement on general questions, such as wages and hours of labour, and havepower to assist any union which is attacked ou any vitalquestion of trade union principle ; (3) Where disputes arise, or threaten to arise, between trade unionsuse its influence to promote a settlement; (4) Assist trade unions in the work of organising and carry on propaganda with a view to strengthening the industrial sideof the movement.(5) Enter into relations with the trade union and labour movemeuts in other countries with a view to promoting common action and international activity.The General Council will be composed of 30 members, and for purposes of election and representation the constituent unions of the Congress will be divided into 17 trade groups. The Council will be divided into five sub-committees, and the representation of each trade group will be as follows : 
the moderate men was for tho moment negligible, and the personal attack on Mr. Applotou further illustrated the growth of revolutionary feeling. Considerable friction arose from the attack by Robert Smillie on the system of vole bargaining, and a committee was appointed to investigate (lie matter. A telegram was sent to the Government in the name of tho whole of organised Labour demanding the releaso of the Lord Mayor of Cork. The Congress added little to the prestige of Labour, and its offspring the General Staff and the newly-appointed Parliamentary Committee were doomed, for the time being, to inaction.On September 30th the Industrial Courts Act, 1919, expired and with it, except in cases Avhere statutory orders applied, the legal force of wages which were fixed under the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Acts of 1918 and 1919; the engineers, therefore, forwarded direct to the employers the demand previously refused by the Industrial Court. The Liverpool members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union decided by a large majority to remove the ban on overtime, which had caused a good deal of unemployment and Hardship among the workers in other industries.Ernest Bevin presented to the Joint Negotiating Committee and explained at various large meetings his scheme for dealing with matters other than wages which formed the terms of reference of the Dockers Court of Inquiry ; probably the most important proposal made was that there should be established for dockers, regardless of whether they were, or were not, employed, a guaranteed minimum of 41. per week. This scheme, which would have involved a charge of about 2,572,250/. a year on the industry, was approved by a sub-committee of the Transport Workers&apos; Federation. That body was, however, less happy in its relations with the miners, because it was pledged, as was the National Union of Railwaymen, to support their claims, provided that the two partners in the Alliance were allowed to participate in any negotiations with the Government which might take place before joint srrike action became inevitable ; a circular was accordingly issued to the 36 con-stitueut unions, asking them for special powers to enable the Federation to fulfil the obligations entailed by membership of the Alliance. This circular was, in effect, an astute move by the extremist officials, who desired to be &quot;in a similar position to the executive council of the National Union of Railwaymen,&quot; or in other words, to have pleni-plenipotentiary poAvers.Throughout the month the threatened strike of coal miners over-shadowed the industrial world, although it became evident as soon as the result of the ballot was declared that several of the leaders did not relish their position and Avere seeking a Avay out ; the members, while absolutely solid on the wages claim, Avere indifferent or even antagonistic to the demand for a reduction in the price of coal. They Avere greatly discon-certed by the firm attitude of the Government, having been convinced that the mere threat to strike would bring the country to its knees ; there was, however, a good deal of revolutionary talk in South Wales and Lanarkshire, Avhere the miners declared that they would raid and loot provision shops, and, in tho latter coalfield, seize the mines.On September 2nd the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain decided to issue strike notices to expire on September 23rd ; at the invitation of Sir Robert Home, the executive attended a conference at the Board of Trade on September 9th, when they Avere told that the price of coal was a question which concerned the community as a whole, and could not be a matter of negotiation with the Federation ; as regard the Avages claims alternative suggestions Avere made reference to au Industrial Court and discussion with the coalowners of Avago anomalies and of a method of
payment based upon output. The miners&apos; executive decided that no new proposals had been advanced which, in their opinion, would lead to a satisfactory settlement. On September 16th, however, they put forward a series of counter proposals, which wero discussed with the President of the Board of Trade on September 16th, 17th, and 20th ; they offered to withdraw their demand as to prices, provided the increase in wages were immediately conceded, and expressed their willingness to participate in a full inquiry into declining output and the absorption into new standard rates of the various flat rate advances made in recent years. Tho Government agreed to grant only such immediate wage advances as might be recommended by a Court of Inquiry ; the attitude of their executive, which refuse! this stipulation, was approved by a national delegate conference of the Miners&apos; Federation on September 21st, but the Prime Minister amplified the suggestions regarding a datum line to a deputation from the Triple Industrial Alliance on September 22nd. A conference of the Triple Industrial Alliance considered this suggestion the following day, and on September 24th all three sections of the Alliance requested an interview with the Prime Minister, the miners consenting to postpone their strike notices for one week, pending explora-tion of the possibility of a settlement along the lines of the output proposals. The miners met the mineowners on four separate days, but at the conclusion of the meetings on September 29th it was reported by both sides that no agreement could be reached on the datum line ; the end of the month, therefore, found the country facing another crisis. Throughout the negotiations the Triple Industrial Alliance, as a body, failed signally ; a majority of both railwaymen an I transport workers made clear their intention not to strike, thereby reducing the function of the Alliance to the activity of a sub-committee which undertook to put the miners&apos; case before the Press and the public.

Ou October 1st the national delegate conference of the Miners&apos; Federation, adjourned from the previous day, decided by a card vote of 534,000 against 401,000 to take a fresh ballot on a revised proposal, put before the Executive on the morning of the 1st, at a conference between the Government, the coalowners, and the miners. This offer fixed the datum line at 240,000,000 tons per annum as against the 242,000,000 previously suggested.   The conference decided to suspend the strike notices until
October 16th, but there was considerable friction, South Wales, Lan-cashirc, and Durham offering strenuous opposition to the proposals. On October 7th Robert Smillie issued a strong recommeudatioii to the members of the Federation to accept the owners&apos; offer, but most of the local federations advised rejection. The ballot was taken ou October llth-12tb, and resulted in 635,098 votes being cast against and 181,428 for the offer, the majority against being 453,670. On October 14th a conference of miners&apos; delegates decided by 154 to 27 votes that the strike notices terminating on October 16th must stand, and lefused to remain in session to receive any fresh proposals from the Government. Although tho national federation had agreed some time previously to allow sufficient men to remain at work to preserve the mines from destruction, the extremist coalfields South Wales and Lanarkshire lost no time in suggesting that if tho strike were not settled by October 30th all labour should be withdrawn from the pits. Ou October 24th formal negotiations between the Government and the miners&apos; representatives were opened, and ou October 28th concluded in a provisional agreement which was to be submitted to a ballot, the important point being the acknowledgement of the co-relation of wages and output. When the strike was complete, feeling in the coalfields showed wide divergence, varying from entire confidence in the success of the strike and of consequent revolution to keen regret that a strike had been called. The one outstanding point was the absolute solidity of the men ; although a few cases of disorder occurred at Tonypandy there was no general disturbance.Immediately the Miners&apos; strike was called the extremists among the railwaymen, profiting by the absence of J. II. Thomas at Prague, endeavoured to engineer a sympathetic strike ; general meetings of the National Union of Railwaymen were held on October 20th-21st and on the latter day decided by 33 votes to 24 in favour of a sympathetic strike, to take place at midnight on October 24th, if a settlement had not been reached or negotiations resumed. On October 23rd, however, the miners, who had been invited to send representatives to meet the Prime Minister during the week-end, requested the railwaymen tern-temporarily to stipend strike action. The Associated Society of Locomotive Enginemen and Firemen had not been officially informed of the special general meeting of the National Union of Railwaymen and therefore postponed their declaration of policy until October 26th. The Council of the Transport Workers&apos; Federation could not call a strike on their own initiative and their executive did little more than hold a watehing brief. The Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress called a special conference of the representatives of affiliated trades unions for October 27th to consider the best means of helping the miners to secure a settlement; when the day came, however, active negotiations were in progress and the meeting, after a series of adjournments, passed a resolution protesting against the Emergency Powers Bill. In spite of much verbal piotestations of solidarity there was throughout the crisis little fear that railwaymen or transport workers would strike in large numbers ; the danger lay rather in the fear of the workers generally that trades unionism, or the power of collective bargaining, which they had been taught to regard as their only safeguard against exploitation, was imperilled.The month as a whole, and more particularly the threatened railway strike, afforded a good test of the hold which the idea of a revoluion of violence had upon the great mass of trade unionists, and proved the extremists to be still a comparatively small body, but to have acquired an influence altogether out of proportion to their numerical strength.&apos;
Events showed, moreover, that the average British working man, when unaffected by foreign propaganda, had retained his horse sense, and was not yet ready for a general strike with revolutionary aims. The situation was therefore less critical than had been the case in August, when almost every worker believed himself to be in danger of being conscripted and was prepared to use any weapon for self-protection.Opposition to the Government proposals regarding the employment of men in the building industry culminated in a meeting of the Building Trade Operatives&apos; Federation at Manchester on October 26th, when it was decided that proposals to employ ex-Service men could not he accepted without more details and a ballot of members.The eight quarterly divisional meetings of the Co-operative Whole-sale Society yielded a total vote on the resolution of the left wing group of : For.......1,209Against      -.....1,112Majority for -     -      -      97This resolution, to which reference is made above, instructed the directors to further the policy of the Co-operative Party as laid down at the Bristol Congress.-Much activity prevailed in Sinn Fein circles, centring chiefly in the hunger strike of tho Lord Mayor of Cork, for whose death reprisals were frequently threatened. On October 18th a deputation of the Irish Trades Union Congress, consisting of Johnson, Foran, and McPharlan, met various English Labour leaders at the Caxton Hall, when it was arranged to appoint a joint committee representative of British and Irish Labour to investigate the position and draw up a report. The Irish delegates attempted to get into touch with Krassin when in London. The immediate consequences of the death of the Lord Mayor of Cork on October 29th were processions of considerable size in London and the provinces, and a multitude of rosary recitations and religious services.Increasing unemployment, aggravated by the coal strike, became the finest possible asset to the communists, who urged that the panacea was trade with Russia, and illustrated their theme from the industry peculiar to the district in which they were speaking. Considerable harm was done by statements, which appeared in Trade Union journals as well as in the extremist Press, to the effect that unemployment was deliberately fostered by the employers, because the first essential of the capitalist system was &quot; a surplus of labour.&quot; The unemployed were, moreover, urged to &quot; seize and work the productive machinery of the nation.&quot; On October 18th some 20,000 of the unemployed marched in procession to Whitehall, where the Labour Mayors interviewed the Prime Minister ; a gang of organised roughs stoned the police and a charge became necessary ; nine rioters were arrested and 29 policemen injured. The disturbances were the work of the International Union of Ex-Service Men, and had no connection with the demonstrators proper, who waited quietly until order was restored. In London, various relief schemes were stalled by the borough councils, demands being made for Government grants to assist in the prevision of work. In Coventry, unemployed demonstrations continued under the organisation of the Communists.There was considerable activity among ex-Service men, which found expression in meetings and processions in London and the provinces.The circulation of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; suffered a further drop, falling, on au average, 25 per cent., in the provinces and 35 per cent, in
London. During the month the paper published a certificate showing the following average sales : August   -.......   300,011September      ------  329,869October  -      -      -      -. -      -  298,511There was no doubt, in view of evidence from reliable sources, that these figures were grossly inaccurate. At the end of tho month a large quantity of diamonds, of a total value of nearly 2,000,000/., were placed on the English market, being disposed of in packets valued at 30,000/. each. Some of these diamonds were reported to have been in the possession of Edgar Lansbury, while others were offered for sale in the North of England, the only stipulation being that payments should be made in French notes, in order to obliterate, as far as possible, any trace of the transactions. At about the same time a British subject, who declared him-self to be a Bolshevik, and was deported to this country by the Norwegian authorities, landed with a considerable sum in English bank notes, for which he declined to account. These notes were not, however, those which were stated by Tanner to be manufactured in Russia by &quot;cart-loads.&quot;Comparatively little was heard of the &quot; Council of Action &quot; during the month, and in spite of the &quot; Daily If evald&apos;s &quot; prediction of &quot; monster meetings&quot; on October 17th, the demonstrations were much smaller than was the case in August. The speakers dealt with unemployment and with the miners&apos; strike rather than with Russia, but resolutions were passed demanding immediate peace and the resumption of trade relations with a view to relieving unemployment. The National Council, non-plussed by the waning interest in Russian matters, issued a manifesto in which it endeavoured to lay all the evils of unemployment and high prices at the door of the Government&apos;^ Russian policy. On October 18th the Council met in private conference at the Caxton Hall to consider a letter from the joint secretary of the International Federation of Trade Unions regarding the transport, of munitions to Poland, but nothing tangible resulted from the meeting.Although the Communists made tremendous efforts at organisation, issued questionnaires to local branches, and turned out an enormous amount of propaganda literature, the month was marked by recrimination of the most violent kind. Practically the only common meeting ground was exploitation of unemployment, which temporarily replaced Russia as the subject of speeches and made a greater appeal to the audiences. The miners&apos; dispute occasioned alternating waves of hope and despair in the communist ranks, while the refusal of the Labour Party Executive to accept the affiliation of the Communist Party of Great Britain caused an uproar in London and in the provincial branches. Zinoviev, on behalf of the Executive Committee of the Third International, addressed to communists in England and elsewhere a circular dealing with the well-worn subject of Parliamentarism ; this document contained little new matter, but stressed the connection between the &quot; illegal activities&quot; of Members of Parliament and &quot; mass action &quot; in the form of strikes and risings. A somewhat important article written at this time by Radek on the breakdown of negotiations between Britain and Russia admitted that: &quot; We know that the Red Army represents only one of our weapons, &quot; and that our second weapon is the propaganda of communism, which &quot; is forming great armies in the rear of our enemies.&quot;The month was marked by a very general demand for the suppression of revolutionary speeches and literature, but, arrests of some importance damped the ardour of the agitators, who seemed to have a strong aversion to prison,
An issue of the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; contained articles inciting to mutiny and lawlessness, for which Sylvia Pankhurst accepted responsi-bility; she was accordingly arrested, and on October 28th sentenced to six months&apos;imprisonment in the second division. She subsequently appealed against this sentence. On October 25th a Bolshevik courier named Veltheim, Avho had been active in this country for some months, was arrested as he came out of a flat occupied by C. L. Malone, M.P.; he was found to be in possession of important documents, which he was carrying to Russia, and which threw considerable light ou the British communist movement. The most interesting was a manual entitled &quot;The Red Officers&apos;Course,&quot; which consisted of seven lectures for the instruction of cadets for the British Red Army, a section of which it was afterwards ascertained was being enrolled by Jack Tanner. It was proved that these manuals were roneoed from a stencil cut on Malonc&apos;s typewriter. Other documents showed that Russian money had been allocated for the use of Sinn Fein, that 300/. had been spent on propa-ganda for the Lower Deck, and that Tanner had recently received 70/. for &quot; Solidarity.&quot; Veltheim was sentenced to six months&apos; hard labour and deportation. On October 17th Shepperson and Stewart, two communists who had delivered inflammatory speeches in Birmingham, were also arrested and bound over.NOVEMBER.November 8th  -      -   London Council of Action issued circular lettersuggesting maintenance of machinery of local councils.Unemployment Insurance Act came into force. 16///   -      -   Seizure of Sinn Fein documents.National Council of Action issued manifestodeclaring intention to re-open fight for peacewith Russia.18/// - - Executive of British Labour Party issued a manifesto on the Irish question.22nd - - Dr. Maunix addressed meeting of 3,000 at Blackburn.,,      22nd-2lth -   Congress of International Federation of TradeUnions met in London. ,,      23rc/ -      -   &quot; Daily Herald &quot; circular issued by Bevin.24th - - Dr. Mauuix addressed meeting of 4,000 at Rochdale.25/// - - Decree of ejectment granted against Emanuel Shinwell, organiser of Glasgow &quot; No-rent&quot; strike.,,      26///.   -     -  Executive Committee of Irish Self-Determina-tion League met in Manchester.?)      27//i   -      -   National Irish Convention met at Salford.n      28th   -      -  Conference of South Wales and West of EnglandCommunist Party.

The most serious problem during this month was unemployment, which assumed alarming proportions, the numbers in London alone having doubled since the beginning of September, while in Lancashire half a million workers were on short time. Although the majority of the men affected remained steady, class hatred was fostered, for unemployment was invariably laid at the door of the capitalist system by agitators who drew glaring comparisons between the lot of the &quot; master class &quot; and that of the workers. An evil example was set by the seizure of buildings in London, acts which were subsequently proved to have been organised by a gang of revolutionaries from tho International Socialist Club, who contrived to introduce something akin to mob law. Four town halls, five public libraries, two public baths, one territorial drill hall, and 13 large houses were seized, but were mostly vacated as other accommodation for the &quot; Unemployment Committees &quot; was found. In two cases the men were credibly reported to be in possession of arms and ammunition, but the steadier element became aware that it was being exploited by revolutionaries and broke away from them. never-theless, increasing support was given to the extremists, who proclaimed that &quot; Nothing will be done for you until you unite and seize all the &quot; food shops, clothing shops, factories, and Avarehouses and convert the &quot; contents to your own use.&quot;The third anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution was celebrated by various meetings, the largest, at the Albert Hall, being attended by an audience of between 7,000-8,000, composod principally of aliens, Jews, Sinn Feiners, and degenerates. The reception of the evening was given to Malone, whose speech Avas deliberate incitement to assassination and revolution by force; Malone Avas subsequently arrested, and on November 19th was convicted of attempting to cause sedition and dis-affection among the civilian population. He was sentenced to six months&apos; imprisonment in the second division and Avas bound over to be of good behaviour and keep the peace in the sum of 2,000/. himself, and ordered to find two sureties of 1,000/. each. Notice of appeal was given. As a result of Malone&apos;s arrest it Avas apparent, although legal proof would have been difficult to obtain, that he had committed perjury Avhen, giving evidence in the Veltheim case, he stated that he had never seen the Red Officers&apos; Course. A number of copies of this manual were deposited in Underground cloak-rooms and the tickets were posted to Malone.Communist speeches testified to the effect of the recent arrests, and Avere pitched in a minor key, hut efforts Avere made to carry out Lenin&apos;s instructions and unite the various groups into one body. After an informal meeting in London a circular invitation Avas sent to the Communist Party of Great Britain, Communist Labour Party, Communist Party (British Section of the Third International), Socialist Labour Party, the National Shop Stewards&apos; Committee, and the Scottish Workers&apos; Committee, in which it Avas stated that &quot; for reasons which are known, the &quot; chairman appointed by the Moscoav Executive is unable to enter this &quot; country.&quot; This referred to Theodore Rothstein. Great agitation was apparent among the communists Avho Avere no nearer composing their differences, yet feared that failure to carry out instructions from Moscow would entail financial disaster. Sylvia Pankhurst&apos;s group found it almost impossible to surmount monetary difficulties, the income from home sources not exceeding 11. per week, while the Communist Party of Great Britaiu threatened to swalloAV her organisation and absorb the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; in the &quot; Communist.&quot; Sylvia, on the other hand, declared that Maiden Lane had side-tracked some Russian money intended for her, and had used it to defray the expenses of the Albert Hall meeting. On November 28th the Welsh Communist Group O AS 8613 D
discussed the negotiations for a united communist party at great length, and after protesting against the fact that they had not been invited to sit on the unity executive at Manchester, declared that unity could only be obtained if local autonomy were given. At this conference Sylvia Pankhurst&apos;s &quot; Young Socialist League &quot; was absorbed in tho International Proletarian School movement. In Scotland, meanwhile, the Communist struggle had degenerated into an open fight to make a livelihood out of the workers&apos; contributions, the Communist Labour Party, the Scottish Communist League, the Glasgow Communist Group, and the Communist Party of Great Britain all participating. John McLean and William Gallacher, whose command of vitriolic language is second to none in the annals of communism, led the attack, having come into conflict through the organisation and exploitation of rival unemployment committees. McLean, whose ambition Avas to become chief of a United Communist Party of Scotland as a first step to the presidency of the Scottish Soviet Republic, insisted that &quot; avc in Scotland must not let ourselves play second fiddle to any organisation with headquarters in London,&quot; although &quot; William Gallacher is going the rounds ridiculing the idea of a &quot; &apos; Scottish &apos; Communist Party because he has been to Russia, and poses &quot; as the gramophone of Lenin.&quot;On November 8th the London Council of Action suggested in a circular letter, &quot; for the information of the movement only,&quot; that in the absence of instructions from the National Council, &quot; local councils of action should maintain their machinery in a state of preparation.&quot; On November 16th the National Council issued a manifesto in Avhich it stated that &quot;after a necessary suspension of activities due to the miners&apos; &quot; strike and other causes,&quot; it had decided &quot; to re-open the fight Avith the Government to secure Peace and Trade Avith Russia.&quot; Local councils Avere urged to organise special meetings, bombard Members of Parliament with resolutions and distribute literature ; the National Council further offered to supply &quot; quantities of leaflets &quot; for free distribution. The extremists and their press became very anxious about the threatened departure of the Russian Trading Delegation, Avhich had meant so much financial support for them, the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; Avaxing almost hysterical in its anxiety. This campaign on behalf of Russia Avas inspired by Moscow, but met with very little response from the rank and file of labour. The extremist press, infuriated by the failure of the miners&apos; strike as a prelude to revolution, and by the slow progress of communism, indulged in an orgy of abuse, not sparing the British working class, which it described as &quot; the great inarticulate, inert mass of soulless, selfish, and besotted clay.&quot;On November 23rd Ernest Beviu circulated on behalf of the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; Trade Union Committee a circular dealing with the project for a northern edition of the paper, which had been considered by a conference of trade unionists earlier in the month. In this he stated that the money invested in debentures and given to the development fund amounted to 116,100/., and that the paper, which a few weeks ago was losing 3,000/. a Aveek, had been making a profit of about 1,000/. a week since the price had been raised to 2d. He also gave details of the arrangements suggested for a northern edition, for Avhich a maximum amount of 200,000/. would be required.During the month the Socialist Sunday School movement made decided progress, but Margery NeAvbold, who had been in Russia at the time of the Second Congress of the Third International on behalf of the Young Labour League, dreAV up a manifesto in which she said that &quot;discipline must be obeyed and instructions (i,c., from Moscow) &quot; are   ,   .   .   that Ave should try to have only one party for youth
&quot; in England.&quot; Negotiations woro accordingly begun for the unification of the various proletarian school movements into &quot; a Communist Intor-national of Youth.&quot;The Independent Labour Party issued a proposed new policy, which embraced the substitution for Parliament of a National Assembly, decentralisation of local government, communal ownership of land and capital, and direct action. This had a mixed reception, the Left Wing declaring that it did not go far enough, while the Right Wing, which included many working men with small holdings, maintained that it went much too far.The municipal elections provided a marked contrast with those of the previous year, Labour losing much of the ground which it then gained. Of the 1,253 Labour candidates, only 289 were returned, and on the total results won 96 seats and lost 56. The results were due to the realisation of the steadier voters that the application of Socialist theories meant increased rates. Of the 28 metropolitan boroughs, 15 elected Labour mayors, while in the Glasgow City Council, which had been remarkable throughout the year for disorderly scenes, the Labour members secured 44 seats as against 67 held by other parties, an increase of 20.The armistice commemoration made a very great impression on the whole nation, and resulted in a re-birth of national solidarity which had not been apparent since the early crises of the war and which utterly nonplussed the communists. All the efforts to represent the com-memoration as &quot; dope,&quot; &quot; exploitation of the dead,&quot; and &quot; Government propaganda &quot; recoiled upon the people who coined the phrases. It was left to the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; to pour ridicule upon the ceremony and to print a scandalous letter from Francis Meynell which provoked so many angry protests from its readers that on the following day the paper had entirely to change its tone. The staff of the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; which broke the Silence, were raided by an angry crowd from Fleet Street, which used them rather roughly.On November 3rd the delegates&apos; conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain decided to advise the men to resume work. There was a majority of 8,459 against accepting the Government offer. Lancashire and Cheshire, South Wales, Nottinghamshire, and the Forest of Dean polled a majority against acceptance, and in Lancashire the adverse votes were 82 - 77 per cent, of those cast; in South Wales 65*49 per cent. The total vote was 684,549, as compared with 816,526 at the second ballot and 845,647 at the first ballot. The number of abstentions was therefore very large indeed, and it is fair to assume that the men who abstained from voting were against a continuance of the strike. Work was resumed with but little delay in all the coalfields, but there was some disturbance in Lanarkshire, where, as the result of McLean&apos;s and McDougall&apos;s advocacy of sabotage and revolution, the rebel miners attacked the offices of* the county union and indulged in looting on a small scale. The extremist onslaught on moderate trade union leaders bore fruit in the resignations of Messrs. Brace and Hartshorn, who-were replaced by men of a more extreme type. Revolutionary propaganda was increased in the Welsh and Scottish coalfields ; in the latter an agitation was started for the establishment of one mining union for Scotland.The committee appointed by the Association of British Chambers of Commerce to consider the proposals of the Ministry of Transport in egard to the &quot; future organisation of transport undertakings in Great Britain and their relation to the State &quot; declared itself opposed to repre-seutatives of the workers having seats on the Board of Management and
to the transformation of the Central and National Wages Boards into permanent machinery. This report aroused much resentment among tho railwaymen, whose leaders predicted that a struggle for &quot; control&quot; must be the inevitable result.The International Federation of Trade Unions met in congress in London, some 100 delegates representing approximately 26,000,000 organised workers and 18 nationalities. Following the resignation of Mr. Appleton, which was occasioned, as was tho withdrawal from the International Federation of the American Federation of Labour, by tho introduction of other than purely industrial matters, J. II. Thomas, M.P., was elected president. Russia, was not represented, but sent an open letter, in which the Congress was described as consisting of &quot;yellow &quot; leaders who continually betray the fundamental interests of the Labour &quot; movement in general and of the trade unions in particular.&quot; Tho Congress passed a number of resolutions dealing with social and political matters which were outside the scopo of trade unionism as originally conceived. The first international conference of railwaymen also met in London on November 29th ; the resolutions passed related in the main to industrial matters, but some of the speeches touched on wider issues.An important seizure of documents, made onNovembor 16th, revealed the existence of plans for the blowing up of Liverpool docks and a power station at Manchester, and of schemes for infecting British troops with typhoid bacilli and Army horses with glanders. Sinn Fein activity in tbis country culminated in a violent outbreak of arson in Lancashire during the night of November 27th-28th. Eighteen fires occurred almost simultaneously in Liverpool and Bootle, within an area of four miles along the docks ; the. buildings set fire to on this occasion were warehouses and timber yards, entrance being effected by means of bolt-cutters, Paraffin and petrol Avere used. The only victim of these outrages Avas a lad named Ward, Avho was shot dead after giving informa-tion to a policeman. Several important arrests Avere made. In London an unsuccessful attempt Avas made to burn a warehouse, and a seizure of time fuses Avas made at Brixton. The National Irish Convention Avhich Avas to have been held in Manchester on November 27th, and a demonstration and procession arranged for the folloAving day, were proscribed, but the convention was held at Salford under the presidency of P. J. Kelly. Dr. Mannix delivered several long and bitter speeches in Lancashire at the end of the month.On November 17th the Labour Party issued a manifesto declaring that &quot;the British Cabinet has forfeited whatever rights it may have had to govern Ireland,&quot; and that &quot; there is nothing for it hoav but to with-&quot; draw the armed forces, place the responsibility for order on the local &quot; authorities, and provide for the immediate election of a Constituent &quot; Assembly to work out, Avithout limitations or fetters, a Constitution &quot; for Ireland.&quot; The manifesto further stated that the Labour Party had decided &quot; to conduct a great national campaign to enlighten the public on the facts of the situation and to present labour policy.&quot;

In London alone thousands were hungry, half naked, and practically homeless. Cold weather at the beginning of the month added greatly to their sufferings, and while the tragedy of the situation over-shadowed the danger of revolutionary action, the possibility that hunger would lead to rioting increased. Tens of thousands of workers were on short time, a fact that entailed considerable hardship, as in some cases the wages earned were only one quarter of the normal rates. Discontent became very sericus, and the doctrine of class hatred, which in normal times had few adherents in this country, took firmer root under the persistent teaching of agitators and of the socialist press. The Christmas season accentuated the difference between rich and poor, cleverly exploited by the &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; which published in alternate paragraphs notices relating to the actions and extravagant purchases of the rich, and details of cases of hardship among the unemployed. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, which came into force on 8th November, provided&quot; alleviation for the workless who were registered, but section 44, which ruled that no benefits could be drawn until four contributions had been paid, debarred many from relief.  This clause of the Act was accordingly
amended, and at the end of the month a considerable additional number profited from the Act. Wherever possible, schemes for the provision of work wero begun by the civic authorities, and arterial road construction work was started in tho London districts. All these measures, however, as was inevitable, only touched the fringe of the problem, and the unions composing the National Federation of Building Trade Operatives steadfastly refused to agree to dilution by the training of ex-service men. On December 30th, however, a meeting of the executives concerned agreed to ballot on the last Government proposals, which covered a bonus of 5/. for each of the 50,000 men whom it was proposed to train, and a guaranteed wet-weather allowance.The Labour Party devoted considerable attention to the unemployment problem, and urged that each unemployed person should receive a maintenance grant of 21. per week. The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; supported this policy, but added the mischievous advice, &quot;Go to the Guardians &quot;... what Parliament and the Government won&apos;t do, Poor Law &quot; Guardians must do, and will do, if organised Labour and the unem-&quot; ployed will but stand together and compel them to carry out the law.&quot; This explanation to the unemployed of &quot; their legal rights &quot; was printed in leaflet form and distributed gratis. On December 29th the special conference of the Labour Party, which mot to discuss Irish affairs, passed a emergency omnibus resolution on unemployment, in which the demand for maintenance grants for all unemployed persons was reaffirmed. This resolution was the result of the activities of the London District Council of Unemployed Organisations, Avhich on December 21st sent a deputation to the National Council of Action to urge the necessity, in view of unemployment, for the resumption of trading relations with Russia. The Council of Action then arranged for the conference to discuss the matter, instead of embarking upon a perilous course of national conventions and ultimata to the Government, which it could not hope to substantiate. The London District Council of Unemployed Organisations also issued a leaflet to members of the Labour Conference, in which the demand for a convention of local councils of action was reiterated and the proposal made that this convention should give the Government seven day s in which to accede to demands for full maintenance of the unemployed at Trade Union rates of wages. Further, the leaflet required the recognition of the Russian Soviet Government, and the removal of all obstaelcs to trade between Soviet Russia and Great Britain.There was a recurrence, on a smaller scale, of the seizure of buildings, the districts concerned being Hackney (where a fracas between ex-soldiers and police occurred), Ponders End, Walworth, Stratford, and Notting Hill. On December 29th about 100 unemployed held a meeting in Kensington Public Library, but decided afterwards to leave the building. On the same day the unemployables who had been in the Essex Road Library, Islington, were removed by the police, but a subsequent demonstration, numbering about 400, did not attempt to regain possession. Throughout the month processions of genuine unemployed marched through the West End, and were allowed, under certain safeguards, to make collections ; permission to do this went far to consolidate the steadier men, but the fact that unemployment was a powerful recruiting agent for the revolutionaries was nevertheless apparent.Although there was no recurrence during December of the Sinn Fein outrages which marked the previous month, the Irish question obtained much prominence in the Labour movement. A Commission appointed by the Labour Party, and accompanied by a &quot; military &quot;and a legal adviser,-
27visited Ireland to investigate conditions, and on December 28th issued a report in which they declared that &quot; we believe the evideuce wo have &quot; been able to obtain is more than sufficient to justify tho strongest &quot; condemnation of the policy of the British Government.&quot; While dis-senting from the view that the Government &quot; directly and definitely inspired reprisals and violence,&quot; the Commission considered that it had brought into existence &quot;a new constabulary, with its auxiliary division, which was undisciplined and virtually uncontrolled,&quot; and that &quot; the Government must take full responsibility for its own offspring.&quot; The opinion was further stated that &quot; the Cork fires were caused by the Crown forces.&quot; These indictments were repeated in more violent form at a special conference of the Labour Party at the Caxtou Hall on December 29th, when some 800 delegates represented about Z\ million trade unionists and 47,000 members of socialist societies. Of the two resolutions passed, the first called for a judicial inquiry into the question of reprisals, challenged the Government to disprove the statements of the Labour Commission by such an inquiry, and called for the punish-ment of offenders ; the second resolution condemned the outrages &quot;conducted in the name of Sinn Fein.&quot; It supported the view that a possible ground of a settlement in Ireland might be found in the withdrawal of all armed forces, the placing of the responsibility for the maintenance of order on the local authorities, and the immediate election of an entirely open constituent assembly free to frame au Irish Constitution on any lines, provided that it safeguarded minorities and prevented Ireland becoming a military or naval menace to this country. The conference, in the course of which several violent speeches were made, was addressed by Thomas Johnson, secretary of the Irish Labour Party. A vigorous campaign in support of the resolutions will be conducted throughout the country from January 17th to February 14th. Members of the Commission addressed meetings in various parts of the country and aroused a good deal of sympathy. Mrs. Sheehy Skeffmgton also delivered a series of lectures in London.On December 5th an important capture of two Irishmen, who were in charge of a car containing 3 cwt. of gelignite and samsonite explosive, 300 detonators, strum, rifles, bayonets, and revolvers, was made by the Alloa police ; other arrests of Irish people were made in Lancashire. A number of raids were made in Glasgow and London ; papers seized on the premises of Art CBrien in London and his banking account showeu that he had been financing Sinn Fein representatives abroad as well as persons concerned in attempting to introduce munitions from Germany into Ireland. He had also been negotiating with Indian and Egyptian extremists.The various communist executives, unwearying in their efforts to obey Lenin and obtain more of his money, met in Manchester on December 11th and decided to hold yet another, and they hoped a final, &quot; unity&quot; conference - termed a &quot; national convention,&quot; in Leeds on January 29th and 30th. The commuuist demonstration in Trafalgar Square on the following day to protest against &quot; the savagery of the sentences imposed on communist propagandists &quot; attracted only about 300 people. A circular letter was issued by the Communist Party of Great Britain directing all members, and particularly shop stewards, to spread communist doctrines ceaselessly among the unemployed, into whom it was to be &quot; drummed &quot; that communism and the control of industry by the workers was their only salvation. This party also requested Francis Meynell, who had been forced to resign his directorship of the &quot; Daily Herald&quot; on account of the disclosures regarding the subsidy of 75,000/. from llussia, to take over the editorship of &quot; The
Communist&quot;; it was rumoured that he would bring with him part of that sum. On December 11th the Hainpstead branch of the party gave a dinner to Klishko, who, by attending, committed one more breach of his undertaking. He was at this time in communication with Langdon-Davios, of the Labour Publishing Company, regarding the publication of a trade union journal &quot; when the treaty is through.&quot; William Paul, who had been for some weeks in Russia, actually on behalf of tho Com-munist Party of Great Britain, though nominally studying educational methods in neighbouring countries for the Labour College, returned to this country. Lenin had given him explicit instructions as to the part which the communists must play in &quot; the forthcoming Parliamentary elections.&quot; Tn constituencies where they were unable to put up candi-dates, they were directed to issue a manifesto urging the workers to vote for the Labour candidate &quot; in order that Henderson, MacDonald &amp; Co. may demonstrate to the masses their sheer helplessness.&quot; Evidence of tho extent of the Russian dictatorship in England was unwittingly given at this time by Walton Newbold, who admitted in print, &quot; I took opinion &quot; on the iitness of my accepting an invitation to stand as a Labonr Party &quot; candidate, and was informed by the representative of the Third Inter-&quot; national that there was no objection. Otherwise I should not have &quot; accepted.&quot; The extent to which Newbold had absorbed the teaching of his Russian masters was further illustrated in the following passage : &quot; We are no longer operating in the days of archers, pikemen, or even musketeers. War civil war is possible for the infinitesimal minority disciplined and equipped with, and accustomed to use, hand-grenades, machine-guns, armoured-cars, tanks, gas-outfits, firejets, and aeroplanes.&quot;The &quot; Hands off Russia &quot; Committee, which had become almost identical with the Communist Party of Great Britain, issued to all Trades Councils, local Labour Parties, and local Councils of Action a manifesto setting forth the details of the contract alleged to have been secured for United States of America syndicates by Washington Vanderlip, and declaring that &quot; the National Council of Action can force the British &quot; Government to make peace and establish full trading relations with &quot; Russia the rank and file can force the National Council of Action to &quot; act.&quot; The National Council, however, had neither the will nor the power to act; in the words of Krassin, it &quot; has dried up entirely, and in &quot; the next few months T fail to see anything that can galvanise its &quot; corpse.&quot; The &quot; Hands off Russia &quot; Committee nevertheless main-tained its efforts to present trade with Russia as the panacea for unemployment, and was ably seconded by left trade union officials and communist agitators.The &quot; Daily Herald&quot; ran a much advertised &quot; Circulation Push.&quot; This presumably was intended to conceal the use of Russian money, since plans for the Northern edition were developed, in spite of the fact that the investments by trade unions remained comparatively negligible.On December 18th a &quot;Hands off India&quot; movement was inaugurated at Manchester, the intention being to organise a series of meetings &quot; so &quot; that the rank and file of the Labour movement may become informed of &quot; the situation in India.&quot; JNo effect is so far apparent, although effective propaganda speeches, unconnected so far with the above move-ment. have been made by Saklatvala.The scheme to amalgamate all the trade unions connected with dock, waterside, and road transport and various sections of general workers was approved ou December 1st at a conference where some 500,000 workers were represented.    If the scheme be approved by ballot the, local
organisation will take the form of area committees, trade committees, and brandies, and the British Isles will be divided into 11 geographical areas.The Co-operative Wholesale Society directors, who had been obliged to modify their attitude towards the political section of the movement, decided to recommend a grant of 1,000/. to the Co-operati ve Party for the year 1920. On December 18th a joint conference of representatives of the London Co-operative, Labour, and Trade Onion movements discussed the erection of a &quot; Labour Temple &quot; which would house trade unions with headqua tors in London and serve as a central trading depot for the metropolitan co-operative societies. The meeting pledged itself to assist the co-operative movement by trading at co-operative stores, by diverting the workers&apos; savings from the capitalist and Post Office banks to the savings banks of the society, and by investing trade union funds in local society stock or in the Co operative Wholesale Society&apos;s bank.Although revolutionary propaganda made headway in the Welsh and Scottish coaldfields, the miners, as a whole, worked well and increased output ; the powerful trade unions were comparatively quiescent. In spite of this fact, which was due in the main to the steadying influence of unemployment, a slight fall in prices, the holiday season, and the preoccupation of trade union leaders with political matters, the outlook at the end of the year was gloomy, for the dark cloud of unemployment overshadowed the whole country, and industry was rushing towards a crash of the first magnitude. The refusal of banks to make advances on bills of lading and stocks threatened to wipe out, possibly per-manently, small trading concerns and middlemen, and to perpetuate an intensified system of trusts, which must of necessity expedite class war. The strike of shipyard joiners against the reduction of their wages was perhaps the most ominous symptom, for it indicated the proximity of that struggle between capital and labour which must result, either in the obedience of the latter to the laws of economics, or in the bankruptcy of industry. While the issue of the struggle is scarcely in doubt, its course must inevitably be one of industrial upheavals, which will sorely try the stability of the State.CONVICTIONS.January  6th -      -   T.
