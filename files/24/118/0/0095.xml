The revolutionaries are having matters all their own way end there is a steady increase in the number of persons who believe that the Capitalist system is doomed and that &quot;over production&quot; is the cause of the present slump.   Simple explanations of the economic situation are very urgently needed. They ought to be given in the Press as well as in Parliament and every speech delivered by Members to their constituents ought to contain some elementary economic facts.About 5,000 men assembled in Hyde Park to-day and marched via Oxford Street to ICingsway.   No speeches were made and the men matched in an orderly manner.   It is reported, however, that if any attempt is made to check the procession they intend to break through the cordon of police.   The extremists had been urging the procession to ,march to Whitehall, but the saner men prevailed and the extremists are unlikely by themselves to try conclusions with the police.There is growing discontent among the miners, who fear general short time.   The railwaymen and eleotrioians are also restless, but the former have been steadied to some extent by the recent dismissals.   In all these industries the extremists are concentrated on &quot;control.&quot;The Locomotive men and the Railway Clerks have issued a long memorandum in reply to the White Paper from the Ministry of Transport, declaring that &quot;the ultimate nationalisation of railways is inevitable.&quot;  Prom the fact that the National Union is,not a party to this d-oument it may be inferred that there iB still some friction between the two bodies of Railwayman.Efforts are now being made to settle the long standing claims of the Railway Shopmen.Particulars/
t   1Particulars are given of the falling off of the circulation of the &quot;Daily Eerald&quot;.The Court of Enquiry into the national demands of the tramwayman opened yesterday.   The London &apos; busmen are growing restive.Police action in the matter of Sinn Fein in England has h a UBeful effect.There has been a more active campaign of murder in Irelaa during the week. On the other hand, there is abundant evideno of the waning influence of the murder gang end of a shortage o money for the support of persons &quot;on the run.&quot;
unemployment the report of the Joint Committee--on-Uiiemploymentappointed by the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades UnionCongress and the l&amp;eoutive Committee of the Labour Party hasbeen oiroulated to the delegates who will attend to-day1sconference.   It recommends: .Maintenance grants of at least  8 per week for each householder*Maintenance grants of at least  1. 5. 0* for each unemployed single man or woman.Proportion 1 aid for the &quot;under-employed&quot;.Increase of insurance against unemployment.A compulsory 44 hours week and no overtime.Immediate re-opening of trade with Russia.Trade credits and the stabilization of exchanges.Termination of &quot;military adventures&quot; in the East and of &quot;oppression&quot; in Ireland.Construction of new roads and light railways: re-organisation of railways and canals; afforestation; land reclamation and development ef agriculture; better equipment of ports and harbours.Elimination of child labour: raising of school age; increase of scholarships and bursaries.Re-housing on a national scale.These proposals, which even Labour leaders must know to be utterly beyond tho present financial resources cf the country, will probably be accepted at to-day&apos;s conference, but no drastic action to enforce them appears to be contemplated at present.   It is intended to send the report and resolutions to the Prime Minister for consideration by the Cabinet, to every member of the House of Commons, and to Trade Unions and local Labour parties for such action as they may think fit.If the Government has not taken &quot;satisfactory&quot; action in the meantime, the Parliamentary Party will be requestedto/
ito bring the matter before the House of Commons at the opening of the Session.In order to enable trade union lixeoutives to take -the opinions of their members on uny further steps that may be necessary to seoure the adoption of the recommendations, it is proposed that a conference shall meet again on February 23rd.The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is of course doing its utmost tobring about direct action in connection with theunemployment problem; on January 22nd Lcnsbury wroterespecting to-day&apos;s conference:&quot;The keynote of all the talk should be that organised Labour will refuse any longer to pay the toll exacted by Capitalism.   I do not know what the feeling of others may be, but I am quite honestly tired of conferences, resolutions, speeohes, and evejj newspapers.   It is so true - &apos;We live in deeds not words.1nlansbury is opposed to marches and street collections and strongly advises the unemployed to &quot;go to the Guardians&quot;, who, he alleges, study the rate payers first: the unemploy should ap$ly to them not only for ordinary relief, but should make them store their furniture.The marches&apos; of unemployed in the London area have tak place as usual during the week, without untoward incident: there is, however, talk among the unemployables of drastic action before long.   The organisers appear to be making considerable profits and in the oase of Rorton are stated 1 pay themselves as much as  10 per week; the St. Pancras men on the other hand, recently refused to march as they did no receive enough money.Houses have been seized during the week in Blaokfriars Road, Southv/ark and Battersea, in the last named district, at least, by genuine unemployed.Practically no improvement in the unemployment problem is/
- ii!is rtported from the provinces: the only trades in which the demand for workers exceeds the supply appear to he bricklaying and coaohbuilding.   The feeling of the unemployed is becoming very bitter: on January 2l8t a queue of men at Liverpool was a quarter of a mile long and at the women&apos;s exchanges thousands of women waited hours in the side streets for their insurance money; indignation against what is termed &quot;inhuman treatment&quot; is reported to be intense..THE COMMUNISTSUnemployment is still the main theme of communist speeches which are devoted almost entirely to fostering class hatred: nevertheless, the imprisonment of Malone and Sylvia Pankhurst seems to act as a restraining influence, for the speeches are, on the whole, less violent.Communist councillors have identified themselves with the militant unemployed in some London boroughs, but the group of extremists from the International Socialist Club seem to be discouraged.   Mrs. Thring, for instance, who was one of tho originators of the committees of unemployables told my correspondent last week that her &quot;faith in the working class was shaken&quot;; in future she would not be so foolish as to undermine her health in order to help the unemployed. She said that it had been her ambition to inflame the passions of the unemployed in order to.start the revolution; her early successes at Islington, Acton and Enfield had been merely a flash in the pan and she now believes that if a revolution occurs it will be in spite, and not because of, the workers.Jetmett, the organiser of the Islington riot, has been arrested/
. .       or,., ,vvJ V &apos;)C%       ,............ - .....arrested and this faoi will further discourage his association? He has been identified as a man who was oonvioted of laroenj and he was also tried for fomenting mutiny in the Army.It is reported that the extremists have embarked upon a -r^xy expensive form of propaganda; they send glib spokaamarLf railway to many of the Northern-and- Midland Industrial towns such as Bradford. Nottingham and Sheffield. These men engagj their fellow pjissangere in conversation and work in as much \ propaganda as circumstances allow.At Birmingham-van incident has occurred which is typical of the schism in the Labour movement. The communists asked I local Labour Party to appoint representatives to the newly formed Free Speech Committee. After a lengthy discussion fail an amendment, advocating the establishment by the Labour Part;! a Free Speech Committee representative of the whole labour ail trade union movement since the existing, committee was a coma! body, was defeated, it was decided not to appoint repr^eentatJThe first number of   &quot;The Communist&quot; issued under the editorship of Francis Meynoll was stated by the &quot;Daily Herald1 to be &quot;sold right out&quot;, but was nevertheless very poor value, A member of the staff at the new King Street headquarters informed one of my correspondedits that they had &quot;oome into a fair tune - the money the 1 Daily Herald&apos; refused some time ago, The general opinion among the London members of the party is that the paper will deteriorate under &quot;a Roman Catholic bourgeois editor&quot; but they add that they &quot; had, to swallow him in order to get the cash.&quot;The future of the &quot;Workers1 Dreadnought&quot; is nebulous:a somewhat acid editorial in the current issue states that theIsecretary of the Communist Party (British Section of the Third International) informed the editorial committee that the &quot;Workers1 Dreadnought&quot; can no longer be the party organ, owingto/
- 5 - 513to the forthcoming communist fUBion.   The paper will therefore &quot;become an independent organ, giving an independent support to the party from the Left Wing standpoint and it will be run by the comrades who are now responsible for it until Comrade Pankhurst&apos;s release from prison.   Last week the editor disclaimed responsibility for signed articles, thus giving further proof of the effect of recent prosecutionsPROPOSED NEW INTERNATIONALThe provisional constitution and statutes of the new &quot;all-inclusive&quot; International which is to be founded in Vienna next month have been issued.   A summary of various clauses indicates that several of the suggestions of the Independent Labour Party have been embodied, and that the International will incline towards the Left.THE COAL MINERSOn January 24th and 25th the executive committee of the Miners1 International met in London:   Britain, Prance, Belgium, Germany and Czeobo-Slovakia were represented. The delegates appear to have dealt with the economic position of the industry, its &quot;socialization&quot;, the effect of the Peace Treaty on the German miners and proposals for an International Control Board.The fall in exports appears to be seriously affectingi&apos;-,f-the ooal industry in this country and fears of generalshort time are entertained: much capital is being made outof the situation by the extremists who allege that overproduction is the cause.The miners Unofficial Reform movement appears to be making progress and to be closely allied with the &quot;Red&quot;International of Trade Unions.   The Northern miners      ,. .    Section/
Section of the Miners&apos; Unofficial Reform movement held   I a conference in the Socialist Hall, Newcastle, on January 22nd.   Twenty-four miners&apos; lodges sent delegates, the majority being from the Durham coalfields end the others from Northumberland.   Mr. W, Mee, of We3terhope, Co. Durham, President of the Section, was chairman. Mr. George Rcrvey, of Wardley Colliery, near Pelaw-on-TynJi Co. Durham, is secretary of the Section.   Mr. Harvey addressed the conference and reported that letters of congratulation had been received from various districts upon the launching of the miners1 left wing movement in the Northern counties.   He said the movement in other parts of the Kingdom was making rapid progress, and soon the. Miners&apos; Communist movement would be established in every mining district throughout the land.In the North, they had been slow to move, but, he was pleased to report that many enquiries had come to hand as to the meaning of the Northern Miners&apos; Communist movement, and he hoped they would be in the forefront of the National movement ere long.Harvey announced that there would be a world Congress of Trade and Industrial Union Organisations held in Moscow on May 1st,   It would be the Red International of Labour, which would stand opposed to the Black and Tan International of Capitalism.   Capital had formed its v?hite Guard; Labour must form its Red Guard and forge a mighty weapon in the world-wide liberation war of the working class.   He vsas pleased to report that their national movement would be represented at Moscow.   There was to be a national conference at Manchester in the near future, and steps would be taken to link the various coalfield movements- closer together.There/
There would be an interchange of speakers, and efforts would be made to appoint oormanent organizers. L strong determined movement was necessary to get the Trade Unions to withdraw from the Amsterdam Trade Union Federation and support the Red International Trade and Industrial Union Movement of Moscow.   It was up to the miners of Great Britain to support the Russian movement and help to make the Russian Labour Day a Red International Lay, whioh would live in the annals of Labour history.A oircular has been issued by the Northumberland Miners&apos; Association in which it is stated that during the recent strike,  65,000 were paid out weekly with the result that the association hts an overdraft of  60,000 &quot;which has to be repaid at a fixed weekly rate and in addition a large interest on the loan.&apos;&apos;   A vote is to be taken before February 5th as to whether full members will pay a levy of Is. per week, a/-d half-members 6d. to supoort the unemoloyod members..TEE SHOP STBffARDS ESMM1In connection with the &quot;Rod&quot; International of Trade Unions, strong efforts aro b-iing mado to revive the Shop Stewards movement in the Midlands.   The conference between Trade Union officials, shop stewards and Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee, to which rafarence was made in my last report, was held at the Independent Labour Party Rooms, Broadgate, Coventry, on January 23rd.   The following extremists were presont in an official capacity:   Tom Dingley (Coventry organiser Shop Stewards Movement), H.M. &quot;Smery (Secretary of Coventry Unemployed Workers1 Committee), W.J. Chalmers (Secretary of Coventry Branch of Communist Party of GreatBritain/
Britain), Leonard Jackson (Secretary of Coventry &quot;Council of Action&quot;), Jack Leckie (Clyde Workers&apos; Committee), and W, Gallacher (Clyde Workers&apos; Committee).Smery invited several Coventry &quot;rebels&quot; to the conference as ho said   ha wanted them all to watch progress as there would be a possibility of &quot;action&quot; very soon.   It soon became apparent that there was bad feeling between the Amalgamated Engineering Union officials present and the leaders of the Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee (T. Dingley and Emery).   The former have been criticised by the latter for some time past, and the revolutionaries have made no efforts to conceal their, contempt for the constitutional attitude adopted by the Trade Union officials during this unemployment crisis.   Mr. J. Chater (one of the Amalgamated Engineering Union men) asked Dingley how many jobs the Amalgamated Engineering Union had offered him recently and why he refused all work.   Dingley replied that he had never been offered nor refused any jobs offered him by the Amalgamated Engineering Union, and said very heatedly that he was a victim of circumstances.The agenda of the conference covered workshop control: taking over factories: reduotion of wages: and election of Workers&apos; Committees.   The first resolution, whioh was carried unanimously, declared &quot;that this meeting, an organised body of workers representing&apos; every class of industry, resolve to get together and organise both inEide and outside the factories by nrooagancla, with a view of obtaining control of the means of production, believing tnat this is the only solution of the present crisis of unemployment.&quot;   The second resolution, which was carried with one dissentient, decreed &quot;that each Shop Steward of works shall get the men to organise on a class basis in the works so as to be in a position to counteract the/
the attitude of any overbearing foremen or management.&quot; Tom Dingley remarked that this resolution was a great step forward if the Shop Stewards would only carry it out.The following members were then elected as &quot;Workers Council Committee&quot; for Coventry:   Comrade Thompson (Chairman), H.M. Emery (Secretary), Councillor J. Read (Independent Labour-Party), Leonard Jackson (Communist Party), Comrades Harrie (late Unemployed Workers1 Committee), Shillets (Shop Stewards Movement), H. Rinksman (Communist Party, also Building Trade), Shaw (Unemployed Workers1 Committee), Barrett and Stokes (Amalgamated Engineering Union).W, Gallacher and Jack Leckie were present from the Clyde to watch events and to tender advice as to the course to be taken by this r.ewly formed Coventry v?orkers&apos; Council.THIS INlBPSHDSflT LABOUR PASTYThe Left Wing of the Independent Labour Party is not meeting with success at the divisional conferences.   The voting against affiliation with the Third International was 49 to 18 in South Wales and 71 to 16 in Yorkshire.   The extremists are nevertheless &quot;working hard and are now concentrating on the national conference of the party which will be held at Easter. An energetic Left Winger has suggested to Lsvin of the Scottish Labour College, that a &quot;Delegates Training Class&quot; should be started, with the following &quot;functions&quot;:&quot;Careful study of the Agenda.&quot;The best means of attack on Eight Wingers and Centre. &quot;The evidence necessary to prove who are Ttraitors&apos;(a) What the traitors teach in T^rint.(b) What the traitors teach in speeches.(c) General attitude re class war.(d) Reformism.(e) With what Capitalists they &apos;hob nob&apos;.(f) The actual work they have done for Socialism.(g) Is their Socialism&apos; Socialism.&quot;The/       ,
The writer adds:&quot;If the Third International is going to win, it must he by an attack, with all strategical points well guarded and plenty of ammunition.   Can you supply this ammunition from your stores and then *e can hand It out to all delegates before the &quot;Saster &apos;do&apos; at Southport.&quot;That is the suggestion; a systematic organised attack based on facts, courage ai.d fluent speech and we ought to oause a panic in the Right Wing and Centre. Moscow might have some facts for you.   What a fine booklet it would make - Pacts for British Bolsheviks.   You remember that series of questions in &quot;Data&apos;, well like that only more and above all Classified and Indexed ready for use at conferences, so ae to fire off rifcht away while a chap is speaking.   Furnished with a booklet like that we could go to conferences and play &apos;Dodor with &apos;Eeadwalls.&apos;&quot;The Indopendent Labour Party has just celebrated its28th anniversary and the chairman, R. C Wallhead, addressed a meeting at Coventry on January 2ord.   Parts of his speechillustrate the propaganda wnich is being widely spread and whicLis Particularly pernicious when read in connection with theunemployment p.roblem:&quot;Silesia is wanted by the Prenoh Authorities to go to Poland; this is a move on their part so that the Germans cannot fulfil their indemnity in sending the quantity oi? coal to France they should do.   You see if the Germans tail to send the amount, the French will then occupy the Ruhr, Valley, thus   they will get coal from each place whioh they want, not so much for the coal itself as for the bjf- ; products these two coals realise.   Bv these things coming into a country it is euro to make and produce unemployment, I because you cannot compete with the price that these ariiclj from Austria Hungary and Germany are produced in these plaoes.   Take for instance the Russians who used to get w weaving shuttles from Lancashire, but because these could not be sent the Russians hed to make their own with the result that they now have millions of them, so you see they need not come to this country to get these things. The Russian Government sent an order to Dundee for 2,000   j bags and if these could be got through to Odessa they woulij send them back full of corn, and a further order would then be sent for 2,000,000 bags,   flow this order did not  I reach Odessa, but was held up by Winston Churchill at Constantinople, therefore the further order was lost to tbll country end the people of Dundee are working two days per I week instead of full time.   This country wanted to bujr things from Russia but Lloyd George said &apos;But we cannot deal with a revolutionary country&apos;.   So you have all your I boot-makers in this country on short time, yet if each    [1 person in Russia had two nairs of boots each it would find! enough work for all the boot-makers in this country for 5 I years and on full time.   You could ftlso get millions of tow of tim&amp;er from Russia, this would bring down the price of I timber so that houses oould be built oheaper and your renm would be loss.&quot; * j&apos; THE/ - I
A circulation o,gent for one of the London dailies has informed my south Wales correspondent that he estimates the present circulation of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; at about 150,000.   Enquiries which he has made locally show, in some oases, a decrease of 66$ while the average decrease in the South Wales coalfield, since the price was raised, is, he states, 50$.The following circular, which is of particular   * interest, has been sent to all miners1 lodges in South Wales: it will be noted that the price quoted for 100 copies works out at 1^-d. per copy, while the price is slightly less for 1,000.&quot;The &apos;Daily Herald&apos; Limited. .December 31st, 1920.Dear Comrade,We know we have the ^ood wishes of your members, as we have of the whole Miners&apos; Federation, and we are frequently being asked by Lodges, how they can best help the paper in addition to the investment which the Federation has in this company.Curiously enough two miners&apos; ledges have provided what seems to us the best method of assistance.   The two lodges, Choowell and Dawdon, (Durham) purchased a number of copies of the 1 Daily Herald&apos; and arranged for their free distribution.   The results were excellent and confirmed our experience that if we can only get the paper into the hands of trade unionists who have not already seen it we are assured of considerable benefit.Our suggestion now is that your lodge should,,if it can, purchase 1.000 oooieB ,a day for a week.   These we would be willing to supply at  6 per 1,000 per day, and we would pay carriage to tho nearest railway station.   It may be that you cannot see your way to distribute so many, and we would supply smaller quantities at the rate of 12s. 6. per hundred.We would leave it to you to choose the week we shall supply you and of course it is understood that you would give them away free and not sell them.If you are in a position to accept this proposal&apos;&apos;...will/THB &quot;DAIM HERALD&quot;

BRIE AIMThe recent Police action in arresting most of the persons responsible for tho attempted arson in Wandsworth and in searching the houses of known leaders of Sinn Pein his had satisfactory results.   The Irish Self-Determination League is now anxious to disclaim all connection with outrage, for they find lfcheir membership falling off from fear on the part of Irishmen that they may lose their employment in England, and they are finding a difficulty in obtaining halls for meetings.   In spite of their disclaimer there can bo no doubt that a section of them, with the sanction, if not the active co-operation, of Sean McGrath has been in communication with the murder gang in Ireland with a view to carrying on outrages in England.The Labour party&apos;s &quot;Peace with Ireland&quot; campaign has so far not aroused great interest: the largest meeting last week was at Preston, on January 21st, where 4,000 people were present.   The speakers were Messrs. Tom Shaw, Arthur Henderson and Arthur Greenwood, but they added little or nothing to their remarks at previous meetings.   A somewhat dull meeting at Wakefield was attended by 2,000 people, very few of .whom, however, bought the report of the Commission of Enquiry, which was on sale at 2s.   Messrs. Henderson, Greenwood and Lunn are campaigning in Yorkshire.On January 23rd Mrs. Sheeny Skeffington delivered her usual speech at Tonypandy to an audience of about 800, and  , 0&apos;Shannon spoke at Tottenham on the same day.Ireland/
IRELAND317The state of the Provinces has been very much disturbed.   The extremist section of Sinn Fein has increased its activity considerably, with the result that the total number of outrages committed has increased from 182 to 268.The peace rumours have died down; Sinn Fein is not by any means inclined to surrender without s severe struggle, and intense activity may be expected wherever conditions are favourable.It cannot be said that there is any spirit of compromise displayed in the manifesto recently issued by de Valera, whatever there may be in the private thoughts of the &quot;President&quot; and it is not impossible that the muzzle of the revolver of Michael Collins helped to guide the pen that wrote it.Two District Inspectors and ten other ranks of the Royal Irish Constabulary were murdered, 14 polico were wounded, 2 threatened and 12 were attacked but escaped injury.   18 police barracks, mostly situated in the Martial Law areas, were attacked but the attacks were repulsed.T;-.ere are indications that all is not well with the finances of the Irish Republican Aray.   T*ie numerous arrests of its members have undoubtedly taxed its resources for the support of the dependants of the prisoners.   A collection campaign has now been started.   The finance Committee of each County Council has been &quot;requested&quot; to appoint collectors and to organise the collection of subscriptions all over the country.   In many places subscriptions will have to&apos;be exacted by threats as the farmers are not having the best of times and the munition strike cost them a lot of money, both in iipsses and subscriptions for the support of the strikers.
