This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.-      .//   /,o., ,/&apos;    &apos;     /SECRET. &apos;CP. 2460.THE CABINET.THE &quot; EINWOHNER WEHR&quot; IN BAVARIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I have received the following letter from a German officer who was directed to look after me when I was the Kaisets guest at the German manoeuvres. I have every reason to believe that the writer is a man of honour, and that what he says is quite true.W. S. C.The War Office,13th January, 1921.Neubeuern,Dear Winston Churchill, 7th January, 1921.As I hear that certain circles of the Entente expect proposals for a diminishment of the Einwohnerwehr in Bavaria, I venture to write you again in order to assure you upon my honour as a gentleman that such a diminishment in the present moment is an absolute impossibility, unless the policy of the Entente aims at our complete destruction.The constantly increasing-want of labour and want of provisions, the indefatigable propaganda of the Communists, strengthened and backed by Russia, are combined facts which will undoubtedly set the whole country on fire if a diminishment of the Eimvoh-nerwehr should be urged now.I beg you to consider that the Einwohnerwehr has no militaristic or military character whatsoever, and that all contrarious assertions are nothing but radicalistic blunder.I appeal to that personal acquaintance of ours which enables you to know that I speak the truth, and that my patriotism simply compels me to try in perfect honesty and fairness to save the little that can be saved of and for my poor country.I beg you furthermore to consider the fact which I mentioned in my last letter, that is to say, that the danger of a Bolshevistic revolution, heretofore evidently always belittled, is imminent, and bound to spread all over Germany and the neighbouring countries with overwhelming vigour as soon as you do away with or only weaken the last rampart and bulwark against it, namely, the Eimvohnenvehr.I have no confidence into the Reichswehr and Sicherheitspolizei. They would, perhaps, be of some use in Bavaria, because they would not feei alone in the case of emergency. But in Germany at large they are, spoiled by the Russian propaganda, which has its centre in the Russian camps.Believe me that any change now would entirely upset the consolidation of the Bavarian Governments policy. And this policy is fully democratic, decent in every way, constructive and treaty-abiding.I hope and trust, and I do wish by all my German heart, that you in your powerful position will hear and heed my very concerned words.Believe me to be, with all suitable remembrances,Very sincerely yours,Herwarth.(B21/66)   100   1/21  H&amp;S, Ltd  8893wo
