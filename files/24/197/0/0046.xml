Printed for the Cabinet.  October 1928.SECRET.                                                     Copy No.CP. 29.7  (28)..                                 CABINET.THE PROPOSED  REPARATIONS  ENQUIRY.                NOTE BY THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER.    I CIRCULATE, for the information of the Cabinet, the attached memorandum inregard to the proposed reparations enquiry.                                                                   W. S. C.    Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,          October 9, 1928.                           REPARATIONS AND  DEBTS.     THE French Government appear to have issued to their  Press  a positively-astounding summary of what they hope to get out of the proposed reparation enquiry.     After some very inaccurate remarks about the theoretic debt of Germany, thestatement asserts that France requires a watertight guarantee that she will receive, inany new settlement      (a) her  total debt payments to the United States of America and Great Britain          ( 645 millions), plus     (b) the  full cost of  all her expenditure on  the devastated regions (put at some           800 millions).  This gives a combined  total of  1,500 millions  that          France must  demand from Germany as a minimum.     As France is entitled to approximately 50 per cent, of the German payments, ifthis  demand is to be satisfied, the German debt will have to be fixed at something over  3,000  millions, i.e.,  it would have to be approximately 50 per cent, more thanthe capitalised value of the Dawes Annuities. The statement suggests, however, thatthe British Government and the other Allies will not require their full shares, so thatthe total German payments might be reduced  to about  2,250 millions,, of which 1,500 millions, or, three-quarters (sic), will go to France.     Finally, the debt so fixed is to be &quot; mobilised &quot; in parcels of  100 millions to 250 millions at a time.  The process is to be spread over six or eight years, and the rhineland is to be evacuated only after the first   800  millions has been mobilised !    Now this  statement is, from beginning to  end,  sheer stark, staring nonsense.It is obvious that, if Germany.is to be induced to give up  transfer protection,  the dawes payments  will have to be reduced by 50 per cent, rather  than increased by50 per cent.  The requirements of Great Britain and the other Allied Governmentscan certainly not be so scaled  down as to come within the  figure of  750 millionssuggested.  Nor is there any reason why  they should accept any  reduction of their full claims if France is trying to squeeze  800 millions from Germany over and abovedebts.    It is difficult to believe that any of the French Treasury officials or the Bank ofFrance officials has encouraged a scheme of this kind.   It seems to  be  a directemanation from M. Poincare.  It represents the policy  which  he maintained inflexiblyduring the years 1921 to 1924, when the failure of the Ruhr enterprise drove him frompower;  but he seems to have forgotten anything that he then learnt.    If the French representatives on the proposed Committee are  to be instructed toput forward demands of this kind, the Committee will not merely be a  failure, butit will create a  situation of great difficulty (both politically and financially) between us and France and between France and Germany.
