CONFIDENTIAL.O.R  295 (28Y.Draft Circular Despatch to His Majesty&apos;s  Representatives in the Capitals of all    Countries represented  on the Preparatory Commission for  the  Disarmament    Conference.                            THE observations of the Governments of the United                         States,  Italy  and  Japan  on the  British  and  French                         compromise proposals in the matter of the limitation of                         naval armament  having now been  received, the  present                         moment affords a convenient opportunity of presenting,                         for your information and guidance, an outline of recent                         discussions and correspondence on this subject.                            As a result of unauthorised and incomplete disclosures,.                         the nature and scope of this compromise became, as you                         are aware, the object of public  speculation, often of an                         erroneous  and misleading  character.   His  Majesty5s                         Government are  contemplating  the early publication of                         papers, which, in  covering as  briefly as  possible the                         history of the negotiations for naval disarmament, should                         serve to place the matter in its true perspective.   That                         they have refrained hitherto from  publication has been                         due  in part to their anxiety not to embarrass the  other                         Governments concerned by what might have been regarded                         as an attempt to  force  their  hand,  in part to  their                         reluctance  to publish documents while still  incomplete,                         on a matter at once complex in  its technical aspect and                         far-reaching in its  results.                            The Anglo-French compromise cannot be regarded as                         a detached or isolated event; it is the most recent link in                         a long chain of endeavour  to implement the  provisions                         embodied in Article 8 of the Covenant of the  League of                         Nations to the effect that  &quot;the  members of the League                         recognise  that the  maintenance of peace requires the                         reduction of national  armaments  to  the  lowest point                         consistent with national safety.55  The first steps taken                         by the League to fulfil this obligation were turned in the                         direction of comprehensive schemes of  mutual assistance                         in the belief  that  the  creation  of  a  general sense of                         security was the most promising avenue to an all-round                         reduction and limitation of armaments.                            In the face of continued failure to reach  agreement                         on any such scheme, this line of approach was abandoned                         in favour of more direct methods, and  in December 1925                         the Assembly set  up a special commission with mandate                         to prepare the ground for a general conference.  On the                         completion of certain preliminary researches on technical                         matters which monopolised its attention  during  the                         ensuing year, this commission, known as the Preparatory                         Commission,  attacked its main task at its third session                         (March-April 1927), at which the British  and French                         representatives each put  forward  a  draft skeleton                         convention as a basis of discussion.[18265]
    There  was  a wide divergence between these two drafts.  On the naval side the British draft provided for the  limitation  of  vessels  of  war  in  nine  separate categories; the French draft  for limitation,  broadly speaking,  by total tonnage.   It was between these two principles--limitation by classes or limitation by total or &quot;global&quot;  tonnage that  the  chief  controversy has turned.    The  other  Governments represented on  the Commission ranged themselves some on one side, some  on the  other.  Italy,  in particular,  supported the French thesis,  while  the United  States  favoured  the British plan of limitation by  classes while differing as to its application in  detail.   In  the hope of bridging this divergence the  French delegation  some days  later put forward a modified proposal, which became known as the French compromise proposal, and which went so far  to meet the British view  as  to introduce classification by four classes.    It  contained  provision,  however, for unlimited transfer of tonnage from one class to another, and partly for that reason and partly owing  to the small number  of classes proved  inacceptable to  the  British delegation.    Confronted by these acute and  seemingly  irreconci- lable divergences, and anxious to do nothing which might prejudice the success of the  Naval  Conference, to which the United States Government had recently issued invita- tions, the  Preparatory Commission  adjourned without having  made any  progress towards an agreed text of a skeleton convention.  Two months later (June 1927) the Naval Conference met  in  Geneva, only to break  down after seven weeks  of effort to adjust the differing points of view of the Governments represented.   In the face of the  deadlock  in  the  Preparatory Commission,  followed  by the  failure  of   the  Geneva Conference, all prospect of immediate progress appeared to be  extinguished.   The  French  and  English  draft conventions remained unreconciled,  all attempts to arrive at an agreed text having  broken down.  Informal con- versations, however,  were frequent  at Geneva;  naval experts  discussed  the  different points  of  view; the political delegates also  sought a way out of the impasse. These talks ultimately culminated  in the  conversation between M.  Briand  and  Sir Austen Chamberlain  at Geneva in March 1928, which led to the compromise under review.   In the course of their discussions  Sir Austen Chamberlain mentioned certain suggestions which had been made by the British Admiralty and he subsequently communicated a written note of them to M. Briand at the latterfs  request.   They provided  for limitaion by  six classes,  all types of vessel being included.   In considering the terms of this  compromise it shouldbe: borne in mind that the British contention  had always been for limitation in detail, the French contention forlimitation  by total tonnage.   Thus the original  British plan had been for classification by nine classes.  Under the modified British proposals, as submitted to M. Briand after the March conversation, the number of classes had been reduced to- six.  On their side the French Govern- ment, no less  anxious  than  His Majesty&apos;s  Government to promote agreement,  had shown a disposition  to meet the British thesis so far as possible.  In the end a com-
promise was reached on the basis of a limitation applic-able to four classes of wTar vessel.  Like all compromises,.these tentative  proposals  involved concessions by bothsides.  They represented an advance  from a position of difficulty and deadlock which had prevailed for over ayear. While admittedly incomplete as a final solution ofthe naval limitation  question, they would, if  adopted,have  added  two further  classes  of  vessel to  the two classes limited under the Washington Treaty. They couldonly lead to useful results if the other  principal  naval powers were ready to regard them as  offering a possible basis for resumption  of  negotiation in the PreparatoryCommission.  As, in  the  matter of naval disarmament,the question of  classification versus global  tonnage had hitherto  impeded progress, so, in the  matter of landdisarmament, the question of the limitation of military-trained reserves had  proved  a stumbling-block.   the trench  Government and the majority  of  the Govern-ments represented on the  Preparatory Commission had held that reserves  should  be excluded from limitation,while His Majesty&apos;s Government, for reasons into whichit  is  here  unnecessary  to  enter,  had  consistentlysupported the opposite thesis.  For some time, however,they had realised that further opposition on  their part to the exclusion of these trained reserves could,  in the face of the  attitude of the majority of the PreparatoryCommission, only have the effect of preventing progressindefinitely.  So long ago as April 1927 the British repre-sentative  on  the  Commission  (Viscount Cecil) clearlyforeshadowed the withdrawal, for the sake of agreement,of British opposition to the opinion held by the majorityof that body.   When, therefore,  the two  governments were advancing towards a compromise in the  matter ofnaval limitation, it was felt that the process of agree-ment could only be facilitated by a formal intimation tothe French  Government that a concession  made  to theviews of His Majesty&apos;s Government on  naval  classifica-tion would enable them to withdraw  their opposition tothe French standpoint in the matter of military-trainedreserves.   His Majesty&apos;s  Government  have  been  criticised onaccount of the secrecy in which the negotiations described above are alleged to have taken place.   The facts are thatas long  ago as  March  last it was  announced in thePreparatory Commission that conversations were takingplace in the hope of removing the differences which had hitherto  obstructed progress.   When  the Anglo-Frenchcompromise proposals  were ready for submission to theother naval  Powers,  the  fact  was  announced by sir austen Chamberlain in the House of Commons.  I myselfgave to the press on the 30th August last a full summaryof the compromise and an emphatic denial of the specula-tions as  to  the  existence  of secret clauses and politicalunderstandings.   The  whole  case is revealed in the correspondence,  and any suggestions to the  contrary aretotally devoid of foundation.   The proposals thus negotiated were submitted at theend  of July to  the Governments  of  the United States;Italy and Japan.  The replies of these Governments havenow been received  and are enclosed herein.   While theJapanese Government express their  concurrence  in thepurport  of  these  proposals,  the  Governments of theUnited  States and Italy, for reasons which are clearly
and cogently explained in their notes, have not seen their way to accept them.  It is a matter of sincere regret toHis  Majesty&apos;s  Government that this latest attempt to advance from the existing deadlock cannot be completed by being further accepted as a basis for negotiation.  Thevarious  suggestions made  in  the correspondence  are,however,  being sympathetically and attentively studied,and  His  Majesty&apos;s Government  will  continue in thefuture, as in the past, to seek a common basis of agreementbetween  the Powers on this  complex and  supremelyimportant question.
