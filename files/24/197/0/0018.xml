                II.-POSITION  IN  CHIEF  INDUSTRIES.COAL MINING.    A general increase in unemployment in the coal mining industry took place during the quarter.  In some areas the increase took the form of extended short-time  working, whilst  in others, for example,  South &quot;Wales, the&apos; increase was mainly in whole-time unemployment.  For the  country as a whole there was atotal increase  in unemployment of just over 90,000 for the three months endedJune.IRON, STEEL AND TIN PLATE.    While the production of  steel showed  a slight decrease during the quarterthere was, on the whole, little change in the employment position of the trade.In pig-iron manufacture, however, a number of blast furnaces were damped down,employment as a result becoming somewhat slacker. In the tin-plate trade, on theother hand, employment was considerably better at the end, than at the beginningof the quarter.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.    The  completion  of  a large number of contracts  and the scarcity of replace-ment orders  were responsible for  a general  slackening in activity in the ship-building  industry during the quarter.    Ship-repair work was  also  somewhatslacker, although in Southampton there was some improvement.ENGINEERING.    Employment in the engineering industry remained on the whole fairly steadyduring  the  quarter.    There was,  however,  some  falling  off  in the marine engineering section, whilst the usual seasonal slackness in motor engineering also made itself apparent.TEXTILES.    Cotton. In  the manufacturing section  of  the cotton  industry, and  inparticular in the American spinning section, a general increase in short-time working took place during the quarter.   Employment in  the Egyptian sectionremained fairly good.    Woollen and Y/orsted. An extension of short-time working was reported from the chief sections of  the woollen and worsted trade, the total percentage ofunemployment  in the industry rising to 12&quot;0 at the  end of June.    Other  Textiles. In the silk and hosiery trades employment remained fairlysteady during the quarter, but a slight decline in activity in the lace, linen andjute trades took place.BUILDING. BRICK AND TILE MANUFACTURE.    During April and May some seasonal improvement took place in the buildingindustry, but this was counteracted by a  decline in employment during June, due mainly to a falling off in the decorating section of the trade.   In the  brick andtile industry a slight improvement was shown during the period.
CLOTHING TRADES.    In the clothing and tailoring trades the normal seasonal slackness appears tohave set in somewhat earlier than usual, with the result  that employment wasconsiderably slacker in June than  in the two  previous months.   Similarly in theboot and shoe trade unemployment more than doubled itself during the quarter.TRANSPORT, DOCK LABOUR AND  SHIPPING SERVICES.    Employment  at the docks  continued to remain slack.   Some seasonalimprovement  was  shown  in  shipping  services  and  transport towards  thebeginning of the quarter, but employment became somewhat slacker in June....... ::/;^/:: 7 r/;-- .:.f,yr-- ... &quot;
     III. WORK  INSTITUTED  FOR  RELIEF OF  UNEMPLOYMENT.                               Numbers Employed.          [See note on page 1 of November 1924 Report (CP. 541 (24)).]     The  table which follows has been prepared to show, so far as information  is available, the number of men employed on works instituted, with financial assistance from the Exchequer or the Road Fund, for the relief of unemployment.     Scope  of  Table. The  schemes  included  are  those  undertaken  by  Local and  other  Authorities  and  Public  Companies   with  a  financial contribution from  the  State  with  the  object  of  relieving  unemployment;  and  works in  respect of  which  guarantees  have been  given  under  the  Trade  Facilities Acts  as  capital  undertakings   calculated  to   promote   employment  in   this country.   Schemes  to  which  State  financial  assistance  is  given,  but  which are  not  undertaken  primarily  for the  relief of unemployment  (e.g.,  Housing Schemes), and works put in hand by Local Authorities without State assistance are not  included.   Certain  other schemes  involving  Government assistance  are  also excluded  in view of the impracticability of ascertaining the exact number of men who are directly provided with employment thereby; these include the Export Credits Scbeme and contracts  for equipment,  clothing, &amp;c,  accelerated by Government Contracting Departments.     Method of  Compilation. :The figures  for the  Road  and  Bridge  Schemes assisted  by  the Ministry  of  Transport  and  for  schemes   assisted  by  the Unemployment  Grants   Committee  are  (with the  exception  of  certain road schemes  in  respect  of  which returns are  received  direct  by  the Ministry  of Transport)  obtained   from  returns  received   at   Employment   Exchanges  from local   and  other  Authorities  and   Public   Companies.    Those  relating   to schemes assisted under  the Trade  Facilities   Acts are  compiled  by  the  TradeFacilities Act Advisory Committee from returns received from Companies  to whomguarantees under the Acts have been given.Works assisted by 	Number of Men employed at 				June 30,1928.

The figures take no account  of the employmentprovided indirectly, e.g., in the preparation and transport of materials, &amp;c.    f These figures indicate men employed, on the work itself.  They include part only of the men employedon the  manufacture of the&apos; materials used.  They take no account of the  labour involved in winning,transporting, &amp;c, raw materials.    Note, No distinction is now made between the Forestry Commission^  normal and relief work, and grants for afforestation form part  of the normal  programme.  The average number of forest employeesengaged on the. Commissions operations (including Crown woods) during the quarter ended June 30, 1928,was 3,250 as compared with 3,023 for the corresponding quarter of 1927.
                                                 IY. OVERSEA  SETTLEMENT.                                                        (Dominions Office.)    Under the  Empire Settlement Act, 1922 (an Act  to make better  provision for  furthering British settlement in His  Majesty&apos;s OverseaDominions), various schemes have been agreed with  Dominion Authorities.  This Act, as its title implies, is not one of the government measures designed to deal with unemployment, and should not be so regarded.    For many years before and after the war, the natural increase of  population exceeded the net migration movement by about 300,000 ayear, but recently the gap between the natural increase and  the net migration movement has tended to diminish.   During 1926, the natural increase in England, Scotland and Wales was 279,775, and the net migration movement was 103,969.   Consequently, the natural increase during the year, after deducting the net migration, was 175,806:  &apos;&quot;    The number  of persons approved for assistance and the. number of departures during the months of April, May and June, 1928 (with thecorresponding figures for the year 1927), and for the three months ended  the  30th June,  1928 and 1927, respectively, are set  out in thefollowing Table :-                   Quarterly Progress Return relating to Schemes approved under &quot; The Empire Settlement Act, 1922.&quot;Approval and Departure Figures.Dominion.

With regard to the latter, the methods of financial co-operation are so diverse that it is impracticable  to give  an  aggregated  figure of ExchequerAssistance.

Unemployment Insurance.                          (Estimates, Class V, Vote 9.)     The National Insurance Act of 1911 provided insurance against unemploymentin certain selected industries.  It was followed by the Act of 1916, which increased the numbers  of  persons  insured, and, in 1920, by an Act of general scope which applied  compulsory insurance  against  unemployment  to  12,000,000  persons.Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions of receipt  of benefit, increased contributions, provided benefit  in respect of  dependants,  and authorised  theTreasury to make  advances out  of  the Consolidated  Fund up to a  limit of 30,000,000.    By the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1927, the rates of  benefit were revisedfrom the 19th April, 1928, as follows :  17s. (instead of 18s.) a week for men, 15s. aweek for women, with 7s. (instead of 5s.) a week for an adult  dependant and 2s. aweek for each young dependent child.  As from July, 1928, reduced rates of benefitoperated for persons under 21 years of age having no dependants ;  contributions alsowere reduced for all persons under 21 years of age.  Benefit may be paid for threemonths to a  claimant who has paid  30  contributions in the two years preceding the date of his claim, and may continue  throughout each  subsequent period ofthree months  at the beginning of which  this condition is still  satisfied.  During a transitional period,  which in individual  cases may extend to April  1930, benefitmay be paid to a claimant who does not satisfy the above  condition, if he has paid 8 contributions in the two preceding years or 30 contributions at any timeand fulfils certain other conditions.

TABLE 4.                              LAND SETTLEMENT.    In England and Wales the provision of small holdings under the Land Settle-ment  (Facilities) Act, 1919, and other  Land Settlement Schemes for the benefitprimarily of ex-Service  men, are carried out (a) through the  agency of CountyCouncils and Councils  of County Boroughs and  (&amp;) through the Ministry ofAgriculture and Fisheries.    Settlement through Local Authorities. The net capital cost of these schemes upto the 31st March,  1926,  when  the Land Settlement  Scheme came to an end,  isestimated to be  15,250,000, of  which approximately  14,050,000 (net)  was loanedby the Public Works Loan Board.   Interest in respect of such loans is payable byCouncils.   Under Section 26 of the Land Settlement (Facilities) Act, 1919, theExchequer bore the loss incurred up to the 31st March,  1926, on the Councils&apos; SmallHoldings account (e.g., due to charging a fair as opposed to an economic rent), sofar as such loss had been reasonably and necessarily incurred.    As from the 1st April, 1926, the Exchequer assistance takes the form of annualcontributions to meet the difference between the loan charges  and the estimated net income from the Councils&apos; estates.  These contributions which  did not commenceuntil the year 1927, will vary from year to year, and  their total capitalized valuecannot at present be estimated.    In Scotland  land settlement is not conducted  through the  agency of CountyCouncils.    Ministry&apos;&apos;s  Settlements. Since  1916  a  number  of  properties  have  been acquired, and the capital expenditure thereon and the difference, if any,  betweenthe annual cost of maintaining and administering them and the rents received from small holders is being borne by the Exchequer.  Some of these properties have been disposed of and the net expenditure on the remainder does not  involve an appreciablecash call upon the Exchequer, as additional capital expenditure is met from thesurplus cash revenue or from proceeds of sale of property.

After the Armistice, Juvenile Unemployment Centres were opened in  certainlocalities  to deal with the problem of unemployed juveniles.  After a period of closure centres were again established, and the cost, which was originally shared bythe Board of Education and Local  Authorities, was, from the 1st April, 1923, to the31st March, 1924, partly met out of Relief of Unemployment Vote by grants up to75  per cent, in respect  of approved schemes, the - Local  Authority providing theremaining 25 per cent.  From the  1st April, 1924,  the Exchequer Grant was, as anemergency measure, for so long as unemployment amongst juveniles  remains acute,raised to  100 per cent, of the approved out-of-pocket expenses  of  Local EducationAuthorities.     From the 1st April,  1926, the Exchequer Grant was revised as follows: (1.)  To Authorities in whose areas the average rate of unemployment among insured        juveniles exceeded 6 per cent, during the twelve months which ended on the        23rd November,  1925.     A per capita grant  fixed by the Minister for each  Authority  separately equalto the approved average weekly cost to the Authority of each Juvenile in averageattendance, taking  into  account  recurrent expenditure only,  during  the  twelvemonths which ended on  the  30th  June, 30th September,  or  31st December,  1925,whichever was the latest period for which consecutive claims had been received.  Ifcomplete figures for one  year ending on one of the above dates were not available,or if the Authority had not previously opened Centres, the per capita grant was fixed by  the Minister on such information,  including the  Authority&apos;s  proposals  for1926, as was available to him.(2.) To Authorities in whose areas the average rate of unemployment among insured        juveniles was not less than 3 per cent, and not more than 6 per cent, during        the twelve months which ended on the 23rd November,  1925.     Either  (i) a per capita grant calculated as in (1)  above, but equal to  three-quarters only of the approved average weekly cost, or  (ii)  a  grant of 75 per cent.of the approved out-of-pocket expenditure incurred by the Authority during  thefinancial year 1926, as  the Authority chose.                           ySCHEMES FOR TRAINING WOMEN AND JUVENILES AND YOUNG UNEMPLOYED FIT MEN.                          (Estimates, Class V, Vote  9.)                                (A.) WOMEN.    The following  table aggregates: (i) the expenditure incurred wholly by  theMinistry of Labour in connection with the Registered Unemployed Women&apos;s Schemewhich operated from 1919 to 1921;  (ii) the expenditure on schemes for trainingwomen in Domestic Service, &amp;c,  under the auspices of the Central Committee, forWomen&apos;s Training. Up  to the 31st July, 1924, the cost of this  scheme was metpartly from Exchequer Grants and  party  from other sources, but, as from  the1st August, 1924, the  whole cost has been borne by the Exchequer.   additional provision has  been made  in the  vote for  1928  for training women and girls  indistressed mining areas with a  view to their migration to other Districts.
(3.) To Authorities in whose areas the average rate of unemployment among insured         juveniles was less than 3 per cent, during the year which ended on the         23rd November, 1925.    Normally no grant  is payable, but if in the case of a County Council theAuthority  can show  that  there are clearly  defined districts where the averagepercentage of insured juveniles unemployed during the year was definitely abnormal,the Minister is prepared in approved cases to sanction grant as in (2) above in respectof expenditure on Centres serving these districts.    In the case of approved Centres established by Authorities who are authorities for elementary education only, grant is paid under (1) or (2) above, according to thepercentage of unemployment among insured juveniles in the area of the Authorityfor elementary education only,  provided that the proposal of  the  Authority  hasreceived the concurrence  of the County Authority concerned.    From  the 1st Api-il, 1927, the Exchequer grant is payable under terms similarto those  in  force  for  the  financial  year  1926, with  the  exception  that,  to qualify for grant  under paragraph 1, the average rate of unemployment amonginsured juveniles in the area of an Authority must have  exceeded 7 per cent, forthe calendar year 1926.   Further, per  capita grants  were revised  so  that  themaximum  rate of grant is 5s. for boys and  4s. 6d. for girls per week of 15 hoursinstruction.    Pending  consideration  by the National  Advisory   Councils  for  JuvenileEmployment of  the recommendations of the Malcolm and Salvesen Committees,it  has been  decided  that  during the financial year 1928  each Local EducationAuthority should receive grant  at  the rate at which grant  has  been paid to them during 1927, irrespective of the percentage of insured juveniles unemployed in their area.    It was decided in December 1927 that  the provision of Centres in mining areas should be largely extended, and in these cases payment of 100 per cent, approvedout-of-pocket expenditure has been sanctioned to the 30th September, 1928.Estimated Net Expenditure from Aimistice to March 8.1,1928.			1928 Estimates.

The Ministry of Labour is conducting a scheme of training for employment inthis country and for work on the land overseas for the benefit of unemployed menwho, owing to the prolonged trade depression, have had no opportunity of learninga skilled trade.   Four urban and two  rural centres have been established.  Thelength of a course of training varies from 10 to 26 weeks.Approximate Expenditure to March 31. 1928.	Provision for 1928.
