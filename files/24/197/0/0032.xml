[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. jLEAGUE OF NATIONS.CONFIDENTIAL.[W 9338/28/98]          Mr. Houghton to Lord Cushendun. (Received September 28.)                                      United States Embassy,My Lord,                                         London, September 28, 1928.     THE Government^of the United States has received from His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment a communication summarising the understanding  reached between the Britishand the French Governments as to a basis of naval limitation, which agreement, itis stated, will be submitted to the next  meeting of the Preparatory Commission forthe Disarmament Conference.     The Government of the United States is willing to submit certain suggestions as to the basis of naval limitation,  as  summarised in the British note.  From the communication of His Majesty&apos;s Government it appears that:      The limitations which the Disarmament  Conference will have to  determine will deal with four classes of men-of-war :  (1) capital ships, that  is, ships of over tenthousand (10,000) tons or with guns of more than 8-inch calibre; (2) aircraft carriersof over ten thousand  (10,000) tons;  (3) surface vessels of or below ten thousand(10,000)  tons  armed  with guns of more  than 6-inch and up to  8-inch calibre,(4) ocean-going submarines  of over  six hundred  (600)  tons.     As the Washington Treaty  regulates the first two classes, that is, capital ships and aircraft carriers, the Preparatory  Commission  will have  to consider only thelast two categories so far as the signatories of  that treaty are concerned..     From the foregoing summary of the agreement it appears  that the only  classesof  naval vessels  which it  is  proposed to  limit under the  Anglo-French  draft agreement  are cruisers  of or below ten  thousand (10,000) tons  armed with guns ofmore than 6-inch and  up to 8-inch calibre, and submarines of over  six hundred(600) tons.  The position of the Government of the United States has been and now is that any limitation of naval armament, to be effective, should apply to all  classesof combatant vessels.  The Anglo-French Agreement provides no limitation what so-ever on 6-inch-gun cruisers or destroyers, or submarines o^ six hundred (600) tonsor less.  It could not be claimed that the types of vessels thus left without limitationare  not highly efficient fighting  ships.   No  one  would deny that modern cruisersarmed with 6-inch guns, or destroyers  similarly  armed, have a very high offensivevalue, especially to any nation possessing well distributed bases in various parts ofthe world.  In fact, such cruisers constitute the largest number of fighting ships nowexisting in the world.   The limitation of only such surface  vessels as are restrictedin class 3 of the draft agreement, that is, cruisers of or below ten thousand (10,000)tons armed with guns of more than 6-inch and up to 8-inch calibre, would  be theimposition of restrictions only on types  peculiarly suited to  the needs of the UnitedStates.  The United States cannot accept as a distinct class surface combatant vessels of or below ten thousand (10,000) tons armed with guns of more than  6-inch and upto 8-inch calibre.  It is further clearly apparent that limitation of  this type only would add enormously to the comparative offensive power of a nation possessing alarge merchant tonnage on which preparation  may be made in times of peace formounting 6-inch guns.     At the Three-Power Conference  at Geneva in 1927  the British delegationproposed that cruisers be thus divided into two classes :  those carrying  8-inch guns,and those carrying guns of 6 inches or less in calibre. They proposed, further, that8-inch-gun cruisers be limited to a small number or to a small total tonnage limita-tion, and that the smaller class of cruisers carrying 6-inch guns or less  be permitted &amp;much larger total tonnage,  or, what amounts  to the same thing, to a very largenumber of cruisers of this class.   The limitation proposed by the British delegation on this smaller class of cruisers was so high that the American delegation considered it in effect no limitation at all.   This same proposal  is now  presented in a new andeven more objectionable form, which still limits large cruisers, which  are suitable to american needs, but frankly placed no limitation whatever on cruisers carrying guns of 6 inches or less in calibre.   This proposal is obviously incompatible with  the       [571 ee-1]
American position at the Three-Power Conference.  It is even more unacceptablethan the proposal put forward by the British delegation at that conference, not only because it puts the United States  at a  decided  disadvantage, but also because itdiscards altogether the principle of limitation as applied to important combatanttypes of vessels.    Much of what has been said above as to vessels in class 3 of the Anglo-FrenchAgreement applies with equal or greater force to class 4.  The American Govern-ment cannot accept as a distinct class of  submarines those of over six  hundred (600)tons,  leaving  unlimited  all  submarines  of six  hundred  (600)  tons or  under.Six-hundred-ton submarines are formidable combatant vessels.  They carry the sametorpedoes as are carried by larger submarines and of equal destructive force withinthe radius of their operation.  They can also be armed with guns of  5-inch calibre.The United States would gladly, in conjunction  with all the nations of the world,abolish the submarine altogether.  If, however,  submarines must be continued  asinstruments of naval warfare, it is the belief of the American Government that theyshould be limited to a reasonable tonnage or number.    If there is to be further limitation upon the  construction of war  vessels so thatcompetition in this regard between nations may  be stopped, it is the belief of  theUnited States that it should include all classes of combatant vessels,  submarines aswell as surface vessels.    The Government of the United States has earnestly and consistently advocatedreal reduction and limitation of naval  armament.  It has given its best effortstowards finding acceptable methods of attaining  this most desirable end.  It wouldbe happy  to continue such efforts, but it cannot  consent to proposals which would leave the door wide open to unlimited building of certain types of ships of a highlyefficient combatant value and would impose  restrictions only on types peculiarlysuitable to American needs.    The American Government seeks no special advantage on the sea, but clearlycannot  permit itself  to be placed  in a  position of manifest disadvantage.   TheAmerican Government feels, furthermore, that the terms of the Anglo-French draft agreement, in leaving unlimited so large a tonnage and so many types of vessels,would actually tend to defeat the primary objective of any disarmament conference for the reduction  or  the  limitation of  armament, in that  it would  not eliminatecompetition in naval armament and would not effect economy.  For all these reasons the Government of the United States feels that no useful purpose would be served by accepting as a basis of discussion the Anglo-French proposal.    The American Government has no objection to any  agreement between GreatBritain and France which those  countries think  will be to  their advantage and inthe interest of limitation of armament,  but naturally cannot consent that such anagreement should be applied to the United States.    In order to make quite clear that, in declining to adopt the Anglo-French Agree-ment as a basis for  discussion of naval  limitation, it seems appropriate briefly to review the attitude of the United States regarding the methods of limitation in orderto  show  that  the American  Government  has  consistently  favoured a  drasticproportional limitation.  The success of the Washington Conference  is known toall.   It strictly limited  all combatant  ships and aircraft  carriers of over  tenthousand  (10,000) tons.   In order to bring  about such limitation  the AmericanGovernment  made  great sacrifices  in  the curtailment  of plans of  building and  in  the  actual  destruction of  ships already  built.    At the first sessionof  the  Preparatory  Conference the American  Government submitted proposalswhich,  were  consistently  adhered  to   at  subsequent  meetings :    (1) That  thetotal  tonnage allowed in each class of combatant vessel be  prescribed; (2) that  themaximum tonnage of a unit and the maximum calibre of gun allowed for each classbe prescribed; (3) that, so long as the total  tonnage allowed to each  class is notexceeded,  the actual number of  units may be left  to the discretion of each Powerconcerned.    Within this general plan the American proposal at  the Geneva Conference was,for the United States and the British Empire,  a total tonnage limitation in the cruiserclass  of from two hundred and fifty thousand (250,000) to three hundred thousand(300,000)  tons, and for Japan, from one hundred  and.  fifty thousand (150,000)  toone hundred and eighty thousand (180,000).  For the destroyer class, for the UnitedStates and the British Empire, from two hundred  thousand (200,000) to two hundredand fifty thousand (250,000), and for Japan, from one hundred and twenty thousand (120,000) to one hundred and fifty thousand (150,000) tons.  For the submarineclass, for the United States and the British Empire, sixty thousand  (60,000)  to
 ninety thousand (90,000) tons,  and for Japan, thirty-six thousand  (36,000)  to fifty-four thousand  (54,000) tons.  It was further stated by the American delegation that, if any Power represented felt justified in proposing still lower tonnage levels for auxiliary craft,  the American Government would welcome such proposal.     The purpose of these proposals was that there might be no competition between the three Powers in the  building of naval armament, that their respective navies should be maintained at the lowest level compatible with national security and should not be of the size and character to warrant the suspicion of aggressive intent, and, finally, that a wise economy dictates that further naval construction be kept to a minimum.    The Government of the United States remains willing to use its best efforts to obtain a basis of further naval  limitation satisfactory to all the naval Powers, including those  not represented at the Three-Power Conference at Geneva, and is willing to take into  consideration in any conference the  special needs of France, Italy or any other naval Power for the particular class of vessels deemed by them most suitable for their defence.  This  could  be accomplished by permitting any of the Powers to  vary the percentage of tonnage in  classes within the total tonnage,  a certain percentage to be agreed upon.  If there was an increase in one class of vessels it should be deducted from the tonnage to be used in other classes.  A proposal along these lines made by  Great Britain and discussed by the American and British repre- sentatives would be sympathetically considered by the United States.  It expects onthe part of  others, however, similar consideration  for its own needs.  Unfortunately, the Anglo-French Agreement appears to fulfil none of the conditions which to theAmerican Government seem vital.  It leaves unlimited  a very large class of effectivefighting ships, and  this  very fact would inevitably lead to a recrudescence of naval competition disastrous to  national economy.                                                   I have, &amp;c.                                                       A.  B.  HOUGHTON.
