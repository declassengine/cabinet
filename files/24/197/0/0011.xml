 his document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.                           CABINET.EI.     ;362  (23) .                 Irish Immigration.Memorandum &quot;by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland,        The Cabinet desired that wo should circulate for their  consideration a.memorandum on immigration from Ireland.   After  consultation we thought it well that the matter should first bo .  explored in its various aspects at an interdepartmental  Conference.   The Conference, comprising representatives of the  Home Office, Scottish Office, Dominions Office and Ministry of  Labour, has met and formulated certain conclusions with which  we are in agreement.   These conclusions are summarised in the  appended note.                                                W o J .H.                                                .  J.G.31st July,  192B.        Note of Interdepartmental Conference on the possibility           of controlling Irish. ^immigration into Scotland&quot;and           &quot;       &quot;               England.        1.   The Conference recognised that there was no precedent  for interference with the right of a British subject to enter  this country and they regarded with misgiving any proposal which  would involve such interference;  but it seemed to them that the  gravity of the  situation  justified a departure from present law  and custom to the limited extent proposed in their recommendations        2.   Note was taken of the possibility as to which the  Foreign Office  are being consulted, of a reduction in the  present quota of Irish immigrants to the United States.   It-  was considered  that If any substantial reduction were made the  result would bo an increased flow of the least desirable class  of Irish immigrants into this country.        3.   Nothing can be done without legislation;  and it was  agreed to recommend that  such legislation should take the form
of prohibiting for a term of years the employment of any personnot fulfilling certain requirements which would be laid down asqualifying him to be regarded as properly belonging to, andordinarily resident in, this country, who should arrive in thiscountry after a specified date, and who had not obtained a permitfrom the Ministry of Labour   or an Employment Exchange).    Thepermit, which would ordinarily be issued only after the applicant&apos;arrival in this country, would specify a particular occupation and a particular employer and it would bo an instruction to employment Exchanges that no such permit should be issued ifworkmen capable of performing ths work were available locally,.or could be made available from other Exchanges.   In announcingtheir intention to legislate, the Government should make it clearthat permits would be granted only in exceptional cases.  Penaltiesshould be imposed on any person knowingly employing such animmigrant who was not in possession of a permit, and on such anImmigrant accepting employment, and power should be taken toremove an immigrant found in contravention of the law.   Exceptionmight be made in favour of certain classes of workers, e.g. femaledomestic servants, and arrangements might bo sanctioned underwhich an exchange of skilled workers in the same trade might bemade betv^een employers in this country and outside.      4.   It  was agreed further to recommend that Courts of summary Jurisdiction should have power to order the removal ofany such immigrants who becomo chargeable to the poor rate withina specified period of their arrival in this country..   the sheriff in Scotland has at present this power with regard to natives of Northern Ireland;  and it should be mentioned that the  IrishFree State Government were recently asked to agree to a reciprocalarrangement for the compulsory repatriation of persons who becomechargeable to the poor rate in Great Britain and the Irish FreeState respectively before they acquire a status of irrsmoveability.No reply has been received from the Free State to this communication.
      5.   The Conference considered, that the advantages of thecourse proposed were that whereas immigration from Ireland wouldbe greatly reduced, it could not he alleged that this was done.on racial or religious grounds, or on any ground other than theprotection of the workmen of this country.   There would be no&apos;discrimination as between the Irish Free State and the otherDominions or as between the Irish Free State and Northern IrelandAgain, the proposal would be free from the objection to which .any method would be open which involved the control at british ports of passengers arriving from Ireland.   The number of suchpassengers is about half a million annually and a large staff of&apos;officers would be required for the work of examination.-   Suchexamination to be effective would take a long time and would seriously incommode a large number of persons travelling in theordinary course.   Evasion would be easy particularly in viewof the facilities of transit from Ireland to this country byother means than the regular steamer services.      8.   The conference considered that, if legislation onthese lines were passed, there would be some evasion of -the law,but that it would not be difficult to devise checks which would reduce the number of persons, illegally employed to a negligiblefigure.      7.   The conference did not contemplate that the measuresindicated would apply to any persons now in Great Britain.   they thought, however, that if the Government should see fit to make an early announcement of their intention to legislate such legislation might properly be made retrospective to the date ofthe announcement.   If  action is to be taken at all it seems.eminently desirable that an early date should be fixed to-prevent forestallment.      It would be desirable to give a confidential warning inadvance to the Dominion Governments of the intention to make theproposed announcement.   Special consideration would also haveto be given to the case of any persons already on their way to
this country from overseas at the time of the announcement totake up employment.      8.   Reference was made at the conference to thenegotiations in which the Government are at present engaged to induce the Governments of Australia and Canada to relax thepresent restrictions on the entry of British workmen into thesecountries.   In particular the criticisms of the industrial transference Board directed against the Canadian and Australianrestrictions might, it was thought, afford material for a damaging criticism of the present proposals.   But on.the wholeit was felt that this was a risk that would have to be run andthat the counter-argument should prevail that it was no usetrying to facilitate emigration from this country if anyvacancies so created were immediately to be filled up byimmigration into this country.      9.   If the matter is to be pursued it will no doubt bethought right to consult the Government of Northern Irelandat an early  stage.   Any discrimination between  NorthernIreland and the Free State would add greatly to the possibilitiesof evasion, and moreover, if immigrants from Northern Irelandwere to remain uncontrolled, the purpose of the scheme mightbe largely frustrated.   In meeting the objections that mustbe anticipated, stress may legitimately be laid riot only on the gravity of the unemployment situation in Great Britain but also on the fact that the British Exchequer is at present making aspecial contribution of very substantial amount annually towardsrelief of unemployment in Northern Ireland.   It happens thatthat contribution is made under an agreement which expires in1930, but for the continuance of which on a permanent footingthe Northern Government are now pressing.
