         zo   (28  y a^/TfSSAPra^SP^ATIONS.CONFIDENTIAL.August 27,  1928.SECTION 1.  [W 8100/28/98]                     No. 1.             Mr. Chilton to Lord Cushendun. [Received August 27.)  (No. 1726.) My Lord,                             Beverly Farms, Mass., August 16, 1928.      WITH reference to my despatch No. 1694 of the 9th August, I have the honour to report that the Anglo-French Accord  on Naval Limitation continues  to be the subject of a considerable amount of comment in the press of this country.  It was, of course, in  the nature of  things that  this should be so,  but with the pre-budget campaign of enthusiasts for a large navy,  which usually starts at this time of year, gathering momentum, the news of the accord and-the understanding as to its terms was well timed to furnish further material  for propagandists  and to give them a peg on which to hang all the old arguments about parity, size and number of cruisers, naval  bases,  merchant marine,  lines  of  communication,  national wealth,   &amp;c. Partisan statements of the comparative naval  strength of the United States and Great Britain are again to the fore, and the United States navy is shown  to be far inferior to that of Great Britain.     2.   In paragraphs 3,  4, 5 and 6 of my  despatch under reference I referred to the doubts  being expressed as to the nature of the agreement and  to the apparent feeling that some mystery surrounded it.  Comments of this nature continue, in spite of the publication of press telegrams emanating from London on the 10th and 11th August stating that the accord involved no pooling of French and British navies, that it was merely  a suggestion for submission to other Powers, and that it would never become a fact if any of these Powers should object to it; that, if agreed to by those Powers, it would still have to be laid before the League Disarmament Conference after discussion by  the  Preparatory  Commission, and that, if endorsed by  the conference,  it would still have to be ratified by the Powers concerned.     3.  In paragraph 2 of my above-mentioned despatch I referred to the possibility of the United States opposing the idea contained in the accord for  the limitation of cruisers, and in my telegram No. 235 I reported the views of the Assistant Secretary of State on this point as given to the Resident Secretary in Washington.   I fear that opinion in  this country  may  concentrate on the question  of  the  limitation of 10,000-ton cruisers;  that it will see in the  suggestions  of the  accord with regard to this matter an alignment of French and British opinion as against that of the United States,  instead of resting satisfied with the fact that the common Anglo-American view as to limitation by categories rather  than on the basis  of global tonnage has prevailed  against the views hitherto held by France.  Opinion here is likely to con- concentrate on the difference of view between  the United States  Government  and  His Majesty&apos;s Government on the subject of 10,000-ton cruisers,  which appears still to subsist  and which is held here to be the most important matter in the field  of naval disarmament.    4.  Mr. Frank H.  Simonds has written a syndicated article in which  he takes this view, and which he concludes by stating that, at the precise moment of  the acceptance of the multilateral peace pact,  Great Britain and France have  reached an  agreement ensuring common  opposition  to all American policy in  the matter of disarmament,  or  rather limitation of armaments, not only on  water but  also  on land; and in the &quot; New York Times,&quot; Sunday edition of the 5th August, Mr. P. W. Wilson, whose articles are rather widely read, contributes  an interesting review of the efforts of the nations towards disarmament, in the course of  which he says: &apos;&apos; Here  and now the point is that Britain and France are  acting together  in what must  be regarded  as a scarcely disguised alliance,  not, indeed, offensive,  but assuredly  defensive in every sense of the word,&quot;  and in which he lays stress on thefact that it is from these two Powers that the United States, whose views on  the cruiser  question  are still opposed  to Great Britain, has received an  invitation to renew the  discussions on naval armament limitation.    5.  It is to be feared that it is this view of the position which will gain currency and which will be held before the American  public.                                                    I have, &amp;c.                                                          H. G. CHILTON.[543 dd-1]
