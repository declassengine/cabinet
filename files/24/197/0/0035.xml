Lord Cushendun to Mr. Campbell (Washington).(No. 1365.)Sir,                                        Foreign Office, September 26, 1928.    THE American Ambassador came to see me this morning and handed me the annexed telegram which he had received from the United States Government.  he also read to me from  a communication  w7hich  he said he  had received  fromMr. Kellogg relating to the incident referred to in the telegram.  In this communica-tion Mr.  Kellogg called  attention to a statement made  by Mr. Winston  Churchillin the House of Commons some months ago to the effect  that the Anglo-Persian oil company was controlled  by the British Government.    Mr. Kellogg went on to say that, of course, the United States had no right orwish to interfere with concessions or business arrangements in Colombia, but thatas Sir Arnold Wilson appeared to be, indirectly at all events, an agent of the BritishGovernment, the language he was reported to have used was  hardly  proper  for aperson in such a position.    I replied to the Ambassador that I had no knowledge of the matter myself, butthat if the facts were as he represented  them, I was disposed to agree that Sir ArnoldWilson&apos;s  language was infelicitous.  There was nothing, however, to show on what sort of occasion the reported speech was made, and it may have  been an after-dinneroration or on some wholly informal occasion, and  Mr.  Houghton  would recognisethat impromptu speeches on such occasions were not always well-chosen, and wordswere sometimes used which the speaker himself would admit  to be  ill-chosen.  Ipromised the Ambassador to look into the matter, and I  asked him  if he desired meto make any official communication on the  subject.  Mr. Houghton replied that- he.thought that would be unnecessary and would  be making too much of a trivialincident,  and that he was quite satisfied with  having  brought the matter to myattention.                                                        I am, &amp;c.                                                           CUSHENDUN.Enclosure in No. 1.                                 Telegram.    THE entire morning press of Bogota on 21st September quoted the following statement of Sir Arnold Wilson, representative of the Anglo-Persian Oil company in Colombia           &quot; The august shadow of the illustrious Mr. Monroe has not yet fallen on    the Province of Uraba,  and there is  no reason to suppose that  American    companies or the Department of  State will oppose the legitimate development    of the natural resources of the Colombian nation in any part of Colombia by    any foreign or Colombian company.&apos;&apos;    September 26, 1928.[573 cc-1]
