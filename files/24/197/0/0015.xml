In  pursuance of tho decisions of the Cabinet taken  at  its meeting on July 25th,  1928  (Cabinet  41 (28)  Cohclu-  sion  7),  the  Committee cn Policy lri regard  to the Induction  and limitation of Armaaa&amp;Bts met on Tuesday.J$$3$[, 31st,  to  consider  the  following questions  German Proposals  for Publicity.       The  Cabinet,  at the  meeting quoted above,  requested  the Ministerial heads  of the Fighting Services  to instruct  their respective  Departments to draw  up for the  guidance  of  the 3ritish representative at Geneva Memoranda setting  out the technical  arguments  against Tables  10 to  14  of  the  G-ermen Proposals  for Publicity.    These Memoranda were  accordingly submitted  to  and tsiren note of  by the Cabinet  Committee  at  the meeting  held on the  31st July.

The  Cabinet  empowered  the Policy Committee,  without  further reference  to the  Cabinet,  to  draft  criticisms on  the Model  Treaty to  Strengthen the Means  of Preventing War  for the guidance  of  the British representative at Geneva  in  case he should  decide  that he required them.       A Memorandum w&amp;s  accordingly prepared  and approved by  the Cabinet Committee  at  the meeting  held on  July 31st.

The Cabinet &quot;instructed the Committee toconsider and determine before tho lilecesc, withoutfurther reference to the Cabinet, unless It was deemed necessary, the instructions for the guidance of theBritish representative on the subject of the FinnishProposals for Financial Assistance, in accordance withthe advice of the Treasury and Poreign Office which Wasunder consideration.   Two papers preparod by the PoreignOffice and Treasury respectively were submitted forconsideration by the Cabinet Committoe.   Copies ofthose papers are attached as an Appendix to thisHeport,   The Committee endorsed the proposals containedin these Memoranda and wished to emphasise in particularthat it would bo undesirable that all the States Whoare contributors to the Finnish scheme should be allowedto sit at the Council on every occasion at which theapplication of the Pinnish Proposals was underconsideration.    Further, the Committee consideredthat, when the details of the financial scheme havebeen worked out  by the Financial Committee at Geneva,the scheme should be submitted to the governments for detailed examination and report by their respectiveTreasuries, and that His majesty&apos;s Government shouldnot finally consent to become a party to these proposalsuntil such time  as this examination had been completed and had been found satisfactory.Private Ilanofactore of Arms.          The  Cabinet  desired the Committee to reconsider     (a)   the Preamble to the Preliminary DraftConvention for the private Manufacture of Arras,  with a
 view to advising whether the  supervision proposed in that preamble was free  from the possibility of dangerous developments, and      (b)    whether the  provisions  of  Article 16  of the Draft Convention were sufficiently precise  to secure that ratification by His Majesty&apos;s Government would not  take  effect  unless  and  until there had  been  a similar ratification  by  the principal producing  Powers.           She Committee  accordingly had  under consideration- tion an alternative text  to Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the original  preamble,  which  had been  prepared  by the Legal - Advisers  to the  Foreign  Office.    As  a result of  their examination,  the  Committee  recommended/that the following alternative text  should  be  adopted  In substitution  for the  original  third  and fourth paragraphs of the preamble:      &quot;Whereas  it  is desirable that  the manufacture      of arms  and  ammunition and  of  implements  of  war      should be subjected  to an  effective system of      publicity and  of Governmental  supervision&quot;. The  above formula has a twofold  advantage -      (i)  that its wording Is not  confined  to private- manufacture, but- covers also manufacture by  the State,which  is the policy approved by  the Cabinet,  and     (ii)  It states quite clearly that the supervision shall be national and not international.                                       .  ed          The Committee further  recommend/ that the fifth paragraph of  the original preamble, which reads -      &quot;Whereas the manufacture of arms, ammunition or      implements, the use  of which in war is     prohibited by  International law,  ought  not to be     permitted for such purpose&quot; - should be excluded, since this paragraph covers the use of poison gas,   for example, which  is  nowhere
referred to in the body of the Convention.   In making this recommendation, however; the Committee felt thatit would be advisable for the Legal Advisers of theForeign Office to be given an opportunity to considerwhether the inclusion of this paragraph is desirable,and that If they should come to that conclusion therecommendation should be modified accordingly.

(Reference Paper No^PtR .A.,Sir,     At their meeting-on the 24th instant the CabinetCommittee on Policy decided to recommend that the cabinet should Instruct the Treasury and Foreign Office to submit to the Committee their views on the Finnish scheme for financial assistance to states victims of aggression Insufficient time to enable them to be considered before the recess.2,   In accordance with this decision, I am directed byHis Majesty [s Principal Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to affer the following reservations on the report ofthe joint committee of the League of Nations entrusted withthe examination of the question and in partiouLar the eightgeneral recommendations tabulated on page 2 of the report.3.   As regards recommendation 8, it seems clear that Ifthe scheme is tfv prove practicable the obligations of theparties to the convention must come into play on a decisionof the Council that the moment for putting them into operationhas arrived.   If each signatory State Is tc reserve the-rlght tf^ decide in each particular case vshether It willoarr?/ out the provisions of the contention, it seems that theconvention can serve no purpose and would add little to
paragraph 3 of article 16 of the Covenant.   Inasmuch as thethesis that the fact of being a party to the conventionentitles each signatory to sit at the Counoll when thequestion is considered would probably only result in preventing the practical application of the convention,it seems necessary to exclude the possibility of such aninterpretation.   There would be little difficulty inincorporating a clause in the convention to the effect thatits provisions are to come into operation on a- decision ofthe Council (for which purpose the votes of the parties tothe dispute would not be counted) and that the fact of being a party to the convention is not to be regarded as makingtho matter one &quot;specially affecting the interests&quot; of themembers of the League concerned, so that tho matter would bedealt with by the Council in Its ordinary composition.   Ifsuch a proposal were not agreed to, it is doubtful whetherit would be worth while proceeding with the idea of con-cludlng a convention at all.   It would obviously he undesir-able to introduce into the convention any attempt to define the aggressor and it seems unnecessary to do so since, evenif no convention existed,  the circumstances would almost certainly be such that the Council would have to decide whether a breach of the Covenant had taken place.4.   Be commendat ion 3 is in accordance with the usual practice whereby League conventions are open to accession byany member of the League and by any non-member State to whomthe convention is oommunioated by the Council for the purpose.If the idea behind the proposal is that the United States ofAmerica may accede, tho recommendation is unlikely to achieve its object, but there seems no reason for excluding theprovision, although it is  Improbable that any State which is
not a member of the League will be filling to participate in a reinforcement of the sanctions of the Covenant.5.   Recommendation 7 principally concerns the Treasury,but the Secretary of Slate desires me to observe that  in aletter to the Foreign Office on the 23rd ultimo the lords commissioners of His Majesty*n Treasury concurred  inprinciple in the application  of the scheme by the Council.under article 11 of the Covenant before article 16 carries int*for ce.6.   The above observations were communicated in a letterof the 21st instant.from tho Foreign Office to the Treasury,who will doubtless submit their views to the CabinetCommittee on Policy.

In reply  I am  to request you to inform Secretary  Sir    Austen Chamberlain  that  Ify  Lords  agree generally with  the views    expressed in the letter  under reply and particularly with those    In  regard to recommendation 8.   They  regard It as  essential    &quot;chat the signatories  to  the proposed Convention should bind    themselves  to  honour  their  obligations under the Convention,    if  and when the Council  of  the League  (excluding States who are    parties tc  the dispute)  decides unanimously that it should come    into operation.

 ill the Convention to make clear that the  signatories of the Convention who are not members  of  the Council are not entitled, to sit with the Council for  the purpose of taking such a decision.   It appears to Their lordships that the requirement of unanimity in the  Council (excluding the parties to the dispute) represents a very adequate safeguard for the States not  represented on the Council that a clear case will have arisen for the application of the scheme ana, for Their part They would not be prepared to recommend His Majesty&apos;s Government to adopt the&apos; Convention unless in such a  ease, its obligations become binding on all the  signatories.        As regards recommendation 7S My lords have already expressed Their concurrence in principle  in the application of the scheme by the Council under Article 11 of theCovenant before Article 16 comes into play.  In thisconnection it should be borne in mind that the financial assistance to be obtained under the scheme would not necessarily take the form of the flotation of long-term loans.  The natural course would be for a State threatened.with aggression to obtain In the first instance a temporary Bank advance or short-term loan which could either be repaid at maturity or consolidated into a long- term loan as circumstances required.   If  such a State were to receive from the Council of the league an assurance that the scheme would be put into force for its benefit, should the aggression be persisted in it should  be able without difficulty to obtain on this security  such temporary advances as it required; and if the Council is authorised. to give such assurances, it should simplify the procedure and increase the effectiveness of the proposed Convention, The other recommendations of the Financial Committee appear to call for no comment,,                             I am, etc 0                       2.
