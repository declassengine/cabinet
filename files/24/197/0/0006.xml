Copy No.   ^                             CAB I H E 37*            -^-cm-CP.256(28).,          PROJECTION FOR BRITISH TRAHLERS OH. MS                        MtJKMAlT  CQASg.      Memorandum by the J*lraLord^of ^ the^Admiraltjv          If we are not to repeat the action of last year and take  all possible steps to prevent British fishing vessels from  going to  the Murman Coast, I consider the proposal for an Armed Escort the only satisfactory one.          As regards the various alt ernatives,&apos; mentioned in CP-  235,  it cannot be assumed that there will be less risk of conflict with Russia If No.l is adopted.  If vessels go without  any control of any sort the likelihood of the very situation that we wish to avoid is Increased rather than diminished.          Alternative  2 appears to  be  open to grave objection.. She Commanding Officer of a protecting vessel who had orders not to use force in any event would be placed in an unfair and impossible position in the event  of any aggressive action by the Ea.s-russians*  His inaction in  the presence of an incident occurring  between the 3 and  12 mile limit would not only be damaging to  our prestige^ but might well be used by the Russians as an argument that we hai abandoned  our contentions as regards.the extent of  territorial watersi         Alternative  4 is, I Imagine,  out of the question..          There remains alternative 3  - and  this is the course recommended.  It is desirable to assert a claim  that is entirely just.  It is an undoubted advantage to have two alternative  regions from which supplies may be drawn, particularly in the winter months.   Pish from the: Murman                                                     Coast /
Coast are a Valuable addition to our markets and commandvery high prices.  It is difficult to  justify a state of-affairs whether German vessels can bring in fish and sellit at high prices which. British vessels are precluded fromcatchingo         If it is decided to afford protection there wouldhe little difficulty in imposing on the trawlers conditionssuch as the carrying of Wireless, reporting of movements,making of rendezvous and keeping in touch with the protectinvessels and vlae avoidance of certain areas which may beconsidered necessary in order to facilitate protective .actions.July 24th, 1928.
