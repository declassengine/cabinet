In view of the bearing on our general commercial    treaty policy, of the Commercial Treaty recently signed between    the  Union  of South Africa and Germany,  I circulate, for the    information of my colleagues and after consultation with the    Dominions  Secretary, a memorandum on the subject which has    been prepared by my Department.                                            sP.C-L.

            SOUTH AFRICANDERMAN GOMivSRCIAL TREATY.     As the points of difficulty arising on the SouthAfrican German Treaty are largely technical and are important not so much for their practical effect in the nearfuture, vhich appears to be nil, as from their implications,the following note in which an attempt is made to elucidatethem may be useful.     The present scheme of our commercial treaties isbriefly as follows.   The treaty is entered into by HisBritannic Majesty but is signed by a plenipotentiary whois designated as having been appointed &quot;for Great Britainand Northern Ireland, all British Colonies and protectorates and all mandated areas administered by His Government inGreat britain&apos;.   The Treaty, however, applies territoriallyonly to Great Britain and Northern Ireland except in sofar as notice may be given of His Majesty&apos;s desire thatthe treaty should be applicable to other parts of the Empire.Sometimes there is a time limit within which the option to accede must be exercised.   Colonies frequently come into our treaties but Dominions seldom do so.   It will be seenthat if no notices of application of the treaty to other-parts of the Empire are given the rights of the foreign country under the Treaty are limited to Great Britain andNorthern Ireland.   It must not however be assumed that therefore the rights under the treaty against the foreign country are of interest only to Great Britain and NorthernIreland; it depends on whether the subject matter is necessarily identified with a distinct part of the Empire.     The main provisions of a commercial treaty fall underfour heads, namely, goods, companies,  ships and subjects.     As regards goods, these are  clearly identifiable  witha .distinct part of the Empire and  in view of the fact  that
4 o1.6different parts of the Empire have different tariffs,it Is unreasonable to expect a foreign country to givethe same privileges to the goods of a Dominion as itgives to the goods of this country if that Dominion isunwilling to enter into the same obligations as wedo by acceding to the treaty.   Nevertheless we havehitherto been generally successful in persuading foreigncountries to agree to a provision under which the goods of any part of the Empire enjoy m.f.n. treatment so longas that part of the Empire gives such treatment to thegoods of the foreign country.   As the importance ofDominion trade increases it will no doubt become more andmore difficult to persuade a foreign country to accept this provision in a treaty made with this country.   TheGermans raised some objection and insisted on the insertion of a clause under which the provision inquestion could be terminated by them at three monthsnotice in the case of any part of the Empire to which thetreaty had not been applied by a date which was about oneyear after the ratification of the treaty.     As regards companies, these must be registered atsome definite place and any rights given to companiesunder the treaty are clearly limited to Companiesregistered in a part of the Empire to which the treatyapplies, that is to say Canadian companies can get norights under our treaty with Germany since Canada has notacceded to the treaty.     As regards ships, our treaties have generallyincluded a clause under which we obtain rights for all ships which are British according to British law.Consequently In practically all  our treaties
British ships, no matter in what part of the Empire theymay be registered, enjoy identical privileges.     It has been our policy to endeavour to maintain thisequality of treatment for all British, ships, but the Germanssubmitted that If Australia, for example, discriminatedagainst German ships It was unreasonable to expect Germanyto treat Australian ships in the same way as she treats shipsregistered in the United Kingdom, in the ports of which german ships enjoy certain rights under the treaty, whereasthey enjoy no rights in Australian ports owing to the factthat the treaty does not apply to Australia.  V;;e had to give way on this point and the German treaty consequently contains an article to the effect that the provisions relating to ships do not extend to vessels registered in any territory to which the treaty is not made applicable.     As regards subjects, we have so far successfullymaintained the view that no distinction shall be drawn between different British subjects according to the part ofthe Empire with which they are connected or in which they areordinarily resident.  The fact that the treaty with Germany isentered into on one side by His Britannic Majesty and givescertain rights in Germany to His Britannic Majesty&apos;s subjects,is considered to show clearly that it is the intention of thetreaty to give those rights to all British subjects without exception.  From, the point of view of maintaining the unity ofthe Empire this Is clearly an  important principle, but how long it will be possible to persuade foreign countries toaccept it is by no means certain.
     From the above it -Till be  seen  that  the righto  and privileges of British subjects  belonging  to the  Dominionsand British  ships registered in the  Dominions  (ignoringthe case of  Germany) In foreign countries are  governed by the network of commercial treaties  entered  into  by great Britain and that there is no occasion for  the  dominions to enter into separate treaties with foreign countriesdealing .71 th subjects or,  except in  the case of  Germany,with ships.  The case of  goods  is obviously quite differentand we cannot be expected  in this country to negotiate forthe Dominions satisfactory tariff treaties.  hither to the treaties entered into  by other parts  of the  Empirehave related to the treatment of goods^   Canada, forexample, has had tariff agreements with France for  a numberof years.     It nhould be noted that in all  our treaties vie  arevery careful to make it plain that when ve grant to  theforeign country concerned  most-favoured-nation treatment, wemean by that expression the treatment  accorded to other foreign countries.  By this means we except from the operationof the most-favoured-nation clauses  any special  treatment inregard to any matter -rhich we may accord  to other parts  ofthe Empire.  The main point in  this  connection is,  of course,Imperial Preference.     In their Treaty with Germany the  Union Government havedeliberately avoided the  use of the  word  &quot;foreirn&quot;  in their most-favoured-nation clauses.   In these clauses  they give toGermany treatment accorded to &quot;any other  State&quot;, a  phrase^hich  is clearly intended  to include Great Britain  or any, one of the Dominions.  There are two points -.vhich arise  outof this.     In the  first place,  since  Great Britain and the rest ofthe Empire are lumped in  with other  States it  is an  obviousinference that the  only British subjects  and British ships which  can claim rights under the treaty inGermany are  South Africans and  South African ships.                            -4-
The treaty is signed on behalf of the Union and if atreaty concluded by His Britannic majesty on behalf ofSouth Africa covers only South African Nationals and ships, it provides a good argument for maintaining thata treaty concluded by His Britannic hajesty in respect ofGreat Britain and Northern Ireland covers only Britishsubjects in Great Britain and Northern Ireland and shipsregistered therein.  As explained above this is aninterpretation which we refuse to admit and if It wereadmitted, British subjects connected with other parts ofthe Empire and ships registered outside the Unitedkingdom would under most of our treaties have no rights at all, and there are no treaties entered into by theirown parts of the Empire which would help them.  Thiswas pointed out to the Union Government and it ^as suggested to them that by means of a protocol to the treatyit should foe made clear that the treaty applied on theBritish side only to South Africans and South African ships.There was obviously no difficulty in getting the germans to accept this limitation and the Union Government couldnot well, in view of their general attitude, take the line that they were concluding a treaty on behalf of Britishsubjects in other parts of the Empire.  The Protocol has accordingly been appended to the treaty and this is satis-factnry in assisting us to maintain our policy.     The other difficulty which arises out.of the use ofthe phrase &quot;any other State&quot; instead of &quot;any other foreign country&quot; relates not to British rights but to the rightsaccorded to Germany.  So far as customs duties are concernedit means, of course, that South Africa cannot reduce herduties in favour of the goods of any part of the Empirewithout simultaneously reducing them in favour of similarGerman goods.  There is, however, a proviso in the treatythat those classes of goods for which preferential rates of                           -5-
duty already exist in favour of Great Britain, NewZealand and Canada shall be outside the scope of thisprovision.   It is, however, impossible under the treaty for south Africa to grant preferential rates on any other classesof goods.   Australia, New Zealand and the  Irish Free Statehave made representations against this provision, the implications of which have also been pointed out by HisMajesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain.   The answer of theUnion Government is in effect that the existing preferenceswere only recently established and represent all that SouthAfrica was prepared to give at the time, that she is unlikely to be willing to accord any fresh preferences duringthe term cf the treaty,which is 2% years, and that if, when she desires to do so, she cannot make an amicable arrangement with Germany she can denounce the treaty if necessary.   Itshould be noted that the South African Tariff consists only of two columns, a maximum and a minimum.   The maximumtariff is the one generally applied and it appears to be theintention that the minimum tariff should be doled out piece-meal to countries with which South Africa may make agreements.In the Act establishing this tariff the minimum tariff wasaccorded to a considerable number of classes of british goods and it was provided that the minimum rates for thoseclasses could not be extended to any foreign country.   Theonly way in which South Africa could make any tariff con-cession to a foreign country under existing legislation would be by the accord of the minimum rates on certain articles not included among those for which minimum rates are granted to this country or the Dominions,   Such concessionswhen granted will have to be extended also tc this country butwe should, of course, under such an arrangement  get nopreference..   Under the Act it would have been possible for south Africa to extend the lists of articles  of  British orother Empire origin accorded the minimum rates without                             -6-
 granting  auch rates  to  foreign  countries to which  she was hound to  give ra,f.n. treatment, hut under the German Treaty she  cannot  discriminate in this way and having accorded such rates to  Germany  is  compelled to give them to certain foreign countries with  which ve have made treaties if she  wishes to continue  to receive  m.f.n.  treatment in those countries on terms of  reciprocity.      Similarly  as regards  subjects and ships she must give to foreign  persons and  foreign  ships the same privileges as she  gives to persons and ships  connected with other parts of the  Empire.  The practical  effect of this at the moment is probably  not great as generally speaking the same  treatment is accorded to  South African, other Empire, and foreign subjects  and ships.  She has, however, tied her hands and could not,  for  example,  exclude German ships from  her coasting trade  without at the same time excluding all British ships other than  those registered in South Africa.      It appears from the correspondence with the Imperial Secretary in South Africa that the Union Government are prepared  to endeavour to secure a modification of  some of the articles  of the Treaty  (other than that dealing with Customs duties) in  order to meet the difficulties to ?/hich attention is drawn  above.  The views  of H,M, Government in Great Britain on  this proposal, as set out in the last telegram to the  Imperial Secretary, may be Summarized as follows:-      (1)  vlihere  the Treaty grants Germany in terms  &quot;most favoured  nation&quot; treatment, it would be best to leave this expression unaltered -  a course which would render It possible for  the Union Government, if the:/ wished, to interpret the expression as we do, i.e, as meaning the treatment accorded tothe most favoured foreign country.      (2)  ?.Vbere the Treaty grants Germany the same treatment as &quot;any other country&apos;&quot;&apos;  or &quot;any other State&quot;  it  would be                           -7-
desirable, on principle, to secure, if possible, thoaddition of such a formula as &quot;not being in regard toHis Majesty one of the members of the British Commonwealth&quot;.     (3) From a practical point of view the Insertion ofthe formula mentioned under (2) would be of real importance only in the case of a few Articles.     It remains to be seen to what extent the UnionGovernment will be prepared to amend the Treaty on theselinesj according to our latest information it is very doubtful whether they will be able to do so.Board of Trade,     20th September, 1928.
