[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.!Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1928.SECRET.                                                     Copy JNo.  2iCP.  282 (28).                                 CABINET.THE FRENCH DEBT  AGREEMENT.             MEMORANDUM  BY THE CHANCELLOR  OF THE EXCHEQUER.    I  CIRCULATE,  for the  information of my colleagues, a draft Note to theFrench Government on the subject of their failure to secure ratification  of the FrenchWar Debt Agreement signed by M. Caillaux in July 1926.    M. Caillaux fell from office shortly after signing the Agreement, but I received an assurance from his successor, M. Poincare, in August 1926, that he would ask theChamber to ratify the Agreement as soon as possible, and at the latest in the autumn of 1926.    In July last Lord Crewe made representations to the French Government  aboutthe delay in  the ratification of the War Debt Agreement. The French reply confirms the assurances given by M. Poincare, but,  in effect, takes up the position that FrenchDebt payments are conditional upon her reparation  receipts,  whereas it  was anessential part of the settlement that the Annuities are on the sole credit of France.    A copy of the  British Note of the 19th  July,  1928,  and a translation of theFrench Governments reply of the  30th August, 1928, are attached for  reference (seeAppendix).    Treasury Chambers, September 29, 1928.                                                                   w.  s.  c.                Draft Note to be sent to the French Government.     HIS Majesty&apos;s  Government desires to thank the  Government  of  the  french republic for the full and frank explanation of its views contained in  the verbal notetransmitted by his Excellency the French Ambassador on the 23rd  August.   HisMajesty&apos;s Government notes with satisfaction the statements that the French Govern-ment has no intention  of departing from the formal assurances given in 1926 withregard to the submission of the War Debt Agreement for ratification by the  FrenchParliament,  and that Bills providing for ratification were introduced afresh duringthe  first session of the existing  Chamber in order  to  keep the  subject  on  theParliamentary programme.     2.  The French Government explains that it has not been possible hitherto topress through the ratification of the debt agreements owing to the doubts felt in theFrench Parliament as to the capacity of France to meet her obligations over the  fullperiod of 62 years contemplated in  these agreements.   The fact that the amoimtand the duration of the Dawes Annuities have not yet been definitely fixed is adducedas a ground for these  doubts,  but it  is pointed out that the French Parliamentauthorised the provisional  payments made last  year  and  this,  and  the view is.expressed that France may be expected to maintain such payments so long as she con-tinues to be regularly paid by Germany.     3.  His  Majest&apos;y&apos;s  Government regrets that it cannot regard such  a qualifiedundertaking  as satisfactory to them or to public opinion in this country.    TheFrench Government will certainly recollect that the suggestion that the French war debt payments to  this country should  be  dependent on French receipts  under  the dawes Plan was  one   which His  Majesty&apos;s  Government was  unable  to  accept.Throughout the negotiations which took place in 1925 and 1926, it was  made clearthat the settlement of  the war debt  offered  by His  Majesty&apos;s  Government and eventually embodied in the Agreement of the 12th July, 1926, was governed by  theprinciple&quot; that the  annuities therein fixed should be on the sole credit of France,and only on this basis was it possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to  agree to terms which amounted in effect to the cancellation of two-thirds of the War Debt.  If  the[18226]B
payments from France were to have been conditional upon her receipts from Germany,there would obviously have been no justification for any such alleviation.  Indeed, solong as the German payments were being duly received, France could reasonably havebeen required to meet the full interest  accruing on her  debt.  During the two years from September 1926, for example, the French receipts from reparations (exclusive of army costs) have amounted to  68,700,000, and would have sufficed to meet the fullinterest charge of approximately  60,000,000 which has accrued on the French debtduring the same period.  The actual payments by France as fixed in the agreement of1926 amounted to  10,000,000, and the balance of  50,000,000 has been left at thecharge of the British taxpayer.     4.  His Majesty&apos;s  Government  has  been willing, provisionally, to accept the reduced payments on the scale fixed in  the Agreement of the 12th July,  1926, in the expectation that that Agreement would in the near future be definitely ratified; but itcould not for a moment entertain the suggestion that France is  at liberty to acquitherself of her War Debt by paying  the reduced annuities fixed in that Agreementso long as she receives  reparations from  Germany to an equivalent amount, butcan reserve the right to suspend those payments if at any time there is any failureof German  reparations.  Such an arrangement would combine the disadvantagesboth of compounding a debt for an immediate settlement and of  nursing a debtor in difficulties,  in the hope that his circumstances may alter.  In the case of France,indeed,  circumstances  have altered,  and altered  very  materially.   For when theAgreement of 1926 was made, the representatives of France pleaded for and obtained a scale of reduced payments during the earlier years, up to 1930, on the ground thatduring these years France would be overburdened with the payments of commercialdebts for which she was liable as guarantor in particular the  payments of theBanque de France to the Bank of England.  In fact, however, the French financial situation underwent so striking an improvement that in 1927 already the Banque deFrance was able to repay its debts to the Bank of England by anticipation, and thisreason for  reducing  the debt annuities payable  to  His  Majesty&apos;s government accordinly disappeared.  While His  Majesty&apos;s  Government is cordially gratifiedthat such a change in the financial situation has been achieved, and admires the effortsthat the present French Government have made to ensure it, it must point out that this change has tended to excite adverse criticism in this country of the reduced paymentsfixed in the Caillaux-Churchill Agreement, and if it were known  that the  FrenchGovernment had suggested that even these payments might be discontinued in theevent of their no longer being covered by the French reparation receipts, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be subjected to irresistible pressure to withdraw the concessions inthe Agreement of 1926 and to ask for a settlement of the  French War Debt on very different terms.     5.  His Majesty&apos;s  Government has  thought  it  well  to  set  out  the  aboveconsiderations; with the same frankness as marked the  communication of the FrenchGovernment, so as to indicate that His Majesty&apos;s Government, as well as the FrenchGovernment, is faced with difficulties as regards Parliamentary and public opinion in regard  to  the War  Debt,  and that such  opinion makes  it  impossible for  HisMajesty&apos;s Government to contemplate an indefinite postponement of ratification.     His Majesty&apos;s Government  does  not desire to  prejudge  the result  of  any discussions which may  take place with a view to arriving at a final settlement of debtsand reparations.  His Majesty&apos;s  Government, though  it has no particular interestin initiating any such discussions, would naturally welcome an  arrangement whichwould completely cover the liabilities it has incurred to the  United States Governmentand thereby permit  it  to release France from her debt obligations, in accordancewith the principle laid down in the  Balfour Note.  But, as  at present advised, HisMajesty&apos;s Government sees no prospect of any arrangement being arrived at whichwould obviate the ratification by  France of  the debt  agreements, and  indeed  suchratification, involving  the acceptance on the  sole credit of France  of the annuitiesfixed in  these agreements, appears to  it to be  essential to any  progress in  further negotiations.     His Majesty&apos;s Government of course agrees that the  French Government aloneis  in a position  to judge the most  favourable  opportunity  for  submitting theAgreements for the ratification of the French legislature, but it relies on the FrenchGovernment to give effect to its assurances to do so at the  earliest possible date, andit must  reserve the full rights that it derives from the  actual obligations of theFrench Government  which it holds, in the event of such ratification being undulydelayed.__      :
APPENDIX.                               THE FRENCH DEBT AGREEMENT.                             (1.)  British Note of July 19,  1928.     HIS Britannic Majesty&apos;s Ambassador is  instructed to set before the Government  of the Republic the following considerations with  reference  to  the French Debt  Agreement with Great Britain :      2.  Mr. Churchill expresses his disappointment at the  negative attitude which M. Poincare adopted in  his references to  the question of inter-Allied debts in the course of his speech in the French Chamber on  stabilisation; and recalls that when M.  Poincare  took office in 1926 he gave Mr. Churchill an assurance (which the latter communicated to the House of Commons on the 3rd  August, 1926) that he would  submit the Debt Agreement for ratification as soon as possible and, at the latest, as soon as the Chamber met in the autumn of that year.  This undertaking has not been  fulfilled;  ratification was postponed from session to  session,  and finally  stood over until after the elections.   Mr. Churchill,  however, hoped that once  a new Chamber was assembled M. Poincare would take steps to carry through not only the stabilisation of the franc but  also the ratification of  the Debt Agreement,  and  thus clear up  a very unsatisfactory situation.     3.   During the course of his speech M.  Poincare stated that the creditors  of France  had not exercised any pressure upon her.   This is  certainly correct, for His Majesty&apos;s Government, having regard  to the  assurance  which M.  Poincare  had already given to Mr.  Churchill,  felt that the exercise of any pressure would be out of place.  On the other hand, the statement as made  by M. Poincare may give rise to criticism in Great  Britain, and  it is  desirable that M.  Poincare should be left under no misapprehension of the expectation of  His Majesty&apos;s Government that he will proceed in the very near future to  propose ratification to the Chamber. In this connection there are two points which  should be noted :    .     4.   In  the first place, there would appear to be no foundation for M.  poincare&apos;s hope that ratification  may be avoided  by  means  of a general  settlement of inter-Allied debts  and reparations.  The information which  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government have received  from America (which was  confirmed only quite  recently by the  United States citizen on the  Reparation Commission, who  is in close  touch with the Agent-General) goes to show that the  delay on the part of the Government of the Republic in ratifying the  Berenger Agreement is a definiteobstacle to any progress with  the United  States Government  on the general question  of  debts,and that the latter will insist  on ratification of this agreement before they will  enter into any discussion  of possible  new  agreements.   It  would  appear, therefore,  that   M.  Poincare&apos;shesitation to ratify the Debts  Agreements  is impeding rather than helping the settlement-which he desires.     5.   Secondly,  His Majesty&apos;s Government, while appreciating the fact that the ratification of the Debt Agreements  is  not  a  popular proposal in  France, cannot  but  fear that thisopposition will only be increased by  delay.  On the other  hand, it  seems reasonable to hopethat,  if M. Poincare would only advocate ratification with the full  authority that he possesses,the Chamber would accept it just as they have  accepted his stabilisation proposals.   It is.particularly desirable  that ratification should  be carried through  while M. Poincare remainsPresident of the Council  and  Minister of Finance.   Any successor to these offices would findhis  task in  proposing  ratification far more difficult.   His Majesty&apos;s Government consider  theearly ratification by France of the&apos;&apos; Debt Agreement to be as  essential as ever, and relying onM. Poincare&apos;s former undertakings, they  expect him to  invite the  Chamber  in the near future to proceed to ratification and  to ensure a favourable  vote by  making the matter a question ofconfidence.   They therefore urge that this should be done as early as possible in the autumn.    6.   It is far from  being the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government to press this request ina disagreeable manner, but they wish it to be  clearly understood that they adhere to the viewthat  these Debt Agreements should in the general interest be  ratified at  the earliest possible&apos;opportunity.    July 19, 1928.[18226]
 (2.) Translation of verbal Note handed to the Foreign Office by the French Ambassador on       August 23, 1928, on the subject of the French War Debt, in reply to the  Aide-Memoire       handed to M. Briand on July 19.     The French Government has considered with the greatest  interest  the aide-memoire on the subject of the War Debts of France, transmitted on  the  19th July on the instructions  of the  British Government  by his  Excellency  the  British  Ambassador at  Paris.   The  French Government wishes to thank the British Government for  the frankness with which it has been good enough to make known its views  on a question in  regard to which it is important to clear up all  misunderstandings, and the French Government  proposes to reply in the same spirit.     1.   The French Government has at no time forgotten the assurances given to Mr. Winston Churchill at the  end of the  month of July 1926  on the  subject of its intention to  submit  to the French Chambers the ratification  of the War Debt Agreements with the shortest possible delay and  at latest in the autumn of  the year in question;  but the French Government has always expressly  reserved the sovereign rights of  the representatives of the nation.  If it has not been possible to obtain ratification, the French Government has explained the  reasons for this to the  British  Government on several occasions at the end of the year 1926 and  at the beginning of the  year 1927.   The British Government  has, moreover, been ready  to show its appreciation of the relations between the Government  and Parliament in France by agreeing to conclude a first provisional agreement for the year  1927-28 and  (the  situation  not  having changed) by renewing this agreement for the year 1928-29.     2.  The French  Parliament would  no doubt, be disposed to  ratify the Debt Agreements if it were convinced that France will be able to meet her engagements during the whole period of sixty-two years contemplated by the agreements.  But without  speaking of other elements in the financial  situation, there  remains, in its opinion, too  much  uncertainty  about the payments of reparations,  which are of  essential  importance,  for  it to be able to  bind the country finally and  without reserve towards its creditors.  No doubt the situation is not  exactly the same as regards the Agreement with Great Britain and as regards the  Agreement with the United States.  But it is none the less true that the reserves accepted by Mr. Winston Churchill are considered by far the most important part of parliamentary opinion  as providing  France with only an  uncertain and limited safeguard.  These considerations apply with  even  more force to the Agreements  with  America, which we should doubtless find ourselves  obliged  to ratify at the same  time  as the ratification of the Agreement  with Great Britain.   This state of mind continues to delay the ratification of the Debt Agreement and, in fact, makes ratification altogether impossible at the moment.    3.   The British Government considers, however, that the French Parliament would agree to modify this point of view if the President of the Council asked for this,  making it a question of confidence.   The French  Government thinks it is  its  duty to assure the British Government that such an attempt to exercise pressure on  the  Chambers would not under present circumstances- stances have any chance of success.  To realise this it is only necessary  to mention that for the last two years each time that mention has been made of the debts in the  Chamber and Senate, no  one has  spoken in favour  of ratification.    The  President of the  Council has, moreover, had occasion frequently to collect  the  opinion  of the  members of the commission of the  two  Chambers  which, up  to the present, have voluntarily refrained from reporting on the Bills for the  ratification of the Agreements laid before them in 1926.  The President  ofthe Council has since the last legislative elections, been  able to consult  personally  the  most influential Members of Parliament.   These conversations have confirmed him in the conviction that the French Parliament continues  to be formally opposed  to  ratification.     The French Government  further desires to inform the British Government  that, in spite of this, the French Government has in no  way  gone back upon the formal assurance  which it gave to the British Government in  1926 to  keep  ratification included in the parliamentary programme.  The Bills introduced during the  former Parliament, not having been reported on in time and having lapsed&apos;, the French Government introduced  the  Bills afresh  during the first session of the new  Chamber, and if the President of the Council,  in the  course of his speech on  stabilisation,  mentioned the  conciliatory  attitude shown hitherto  by the creditors of France, and especially by Great Britain, it does  not seem that British public opinion can raise objection to the fact that the attention of Parliament was thus drawn to a problem the final solution of which rests with it alone.     The British  Government,  moreover, cannot  fail to realise that insistence on the part  of the  creditors  of  France  would  have irrevocably  compromised any hope of obtaining the ratification of Agreements, and the French Government notes  with satisfaction that the  British Government maintains the same friendly attitude in  its  aide-memoire of the 19th July.     4.  The French Government feels bound  to add that  although  the Caillaux-Churchill Agreement has not been ratified, nevertheless the French Governmnt has, in fact,  paid  to the British  Government since 1926 annuities equivalent to those laid  down by  that Agreement. The Agreement has thus been carried out as regards its principal provisions, and will continue to be so as long as the German payments permit.   The  existing Government cannot, it is true, bind its successors, but the French Government can assure the British Government  that it  is not  to the  amount of the annuities in the  Agreement to which  the  principal objections  of Parliament  have been  directed.  They have  rather  been  directed to  the fact  that  it  is
impossible for France  to know if she will be  able to pay and  transfer during sixty-two years,whereas  at present no final  settlement has  been reached  about the duration or  about  theexecution of the Dawes Plan.  But the method of provisional payment  has been  authorised by Parliament explicitly last year and implicitly this year, and there is every reason to believethat,  if no objection &quot;is raised by her creditors, France has decided to maintain this policy aslong as she is paid regularly by Germany.    5.   The French  Government has  examined  with  particular  care paragraph  4 of  the aide-mSmoire of the 19th  July, in which  the British  Government states, on the strength ofinformation from a source  which is not known to us, that in the  absence  of ratification of theMellon-Berenger Agreement,  the Government of the United States  would refuse to take partin a discussion in due  course of a general settlement of reparation and Allied debts.    France, being creditor of Germany on account of reparation and debtor on  account ofAllied debts, would evidently have no  reason to oppose  a  general  settlement of this  kind, ifit  took full account of the right of France  to reparation.   This is not a  matter in  which theinitiative rests with the French Government, and it can only inform the British Governmentthat,  if  the opportunity of such  a general settlement comes to be recognised,  the FrenchChambers, which will  have to approve the final conditions and the settlement of the period ofthe German payment,  will also necessarily  have to pronounce  upon the final conditions of thesettlement of the debts of France to the United States and to Great Britain.   When this comes to pass, the question of ratification will  no  doubt be presented under  a new aspect.
