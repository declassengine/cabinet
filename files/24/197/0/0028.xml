[This  Document  is the Property  of His Britannic  Majesty^ Government. ]Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1928.SECRET.                                                     Copy No.2iCP. 279 (2.8).                                 CABINET.FUTURE BRITISH GARRISONS IN CHINA.                NOTE BY THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER.    I CIRCULATE for consideration by my colleagues a Memorandum prepared bythe Treasury in reply to the Memorandum by the Secretary for War (CP. 278 (28)).                                                                  w. s. c.    Treasury Chambers, S. W.  1,          October 9, 1928.     1.  The total number of  battalions  in China was,  before the War,  6; and in1926, 3; now it is 8.  The War Office propose that the permanent strength shall infuture be 6, i.e., 3 more than  before the  recent disturbances.  (The figures in eachcase include  1 Indian battalion.)   This  increase is apart from the  demand  for a fourth  additional  battalion  at  Singapore,   made  by the  C.I.G.S. last   April(CP. 136 (28), para. 7).     2.  Such an increase, as  pointed out by the C.I.G.S.,  in 847-B, para.  9  (b),&quot; would upset the balance in line battalions at Home and  Abroad, and, since financial conditions preclude an increase in the number of battalions, could only be adjustedby  a modification of the Cardwell system,&quot;  which would  in  turn (para.:  9 (e))&quot;involve a reduction of the pool  of infantry at home from which to organise ourExpeditionary Force  to such figures as to leave  practically no margin for internal security in England.&quot;     3.  While the Army Council are (apparently) at present prepared to take thatrisk, in order to secure the desired addition to the Far. Eastern garrison, withoutasking now for an increase in the total number of battalions, it is conceivable thata time may come when the consequent weakening of Our forces at home, and the alleged  desirability of adhering strictly to the Cardwell system, will be  used as aground for demanding such an  increase.  The present proposal, therefore;, if accepted,amounts practically to. a confession that our  present Army.is too small; and thewhole tenor of  Paper 847-B  shows that the C.I.G.S.   is not likely  to regard theposition as permanently satisfactory.  See also  Paper  900-B, para. 42.   &quot;Underthe proposals of the C.I.G.S.&quot; (for strengthening the  permanent garrisons in theFar East and the Mediterranean), &quot; the margin of regular infantry remaining &quot;  (athome) &apos;&apos; over and above the 60 battalions required for our 5 divisions &quot; (ExpeditionaryForce), &quot; cannot be regarded as a safe one.&quot; .    4.  The direct financial effect of this proposal is the cost of providing permanent accommodation for 2 British battalions at Hongkong.   The Secretary of State givesno estimate but, to judge from the pre-war cost of building in China, it would appearthat the total cost should be put,  very roughly, at between  700,000 and   900,000,spread over two or three years.   In view of the pressing need of economy in the nextand following years, in order that provision may be made to meet the needs of the rating Reform scheme and the grave Unemployment situation, as emphasised by therecent Cabinet decision of  the 23rd July, 1928 (40 (28), Conclusion 1  (o)), such aproposal could only be justified on grounds of imperative urgency.   The Treasurycontend that in fact no such urgency exists.      [18214]
    5.  The proposal appears to be advocated on two grounds :      (i) as a measure of insurance, &quot; to obviate the necessity of sending reinforce-&apos;           ments from England should another emergency arise.&quot;    (ii)effr&apos;$heLprotectioh of the Naval bases in the Far East against the danger of           attack by Japan.  &quot; With the initiative in her hands at the outset, Japan           might  attempt the  capture of  Hongkong or  Singapore,  or  both&quot;           (Review of  Imperial Defence, 1928, by the Chiefs  of Staff,  900-B.           para. 38).   &quot; The doubling of the present garrison of Hongkong would           provide .a. material deterrent against attack by Japan &quot; (ibid.).    6.  As regards (i), it is possible to over-insure.  There have, in fact, been only two occasions in the last 50 years,  prior to 1927, when  extra forces have had to besent to China, viz.  :          (1) Boxer Rebellion,  1900  : Sixteen Battalions.         (2) The &quot;first rebellion,&quot;  1911/12:  Three Battalions.Since, in 1900, we  had to send 16 extra battalions, and  in the alarm of 1927 no lessthan 20,  it by no means necessarily follows that in  a future emergency the presenceof 6 battalions will secure us from the cost  of  temporary  reinforcements.  that number was, in fact, already in  China in 1911/12 when the extra 3 battalions were required.   It is submitted that the &quot;insurance&quot;  argument does not justify theheavy  additional expenditure  directly involved, with  the contingent  liability  ofincreasing pressure for a permanent increase of the size of the Army.    7.  As regards the second argument, reference should be made to the  foreign secretary&apos;s remarks at the 215th meeting of the  C.I.D.  in July 1926, when he drew attention to a paragraph in the Chiefs of Staff Review  for 1926 &quot; to the effect thatthere  might be some further safeguards which could be taken locally or  organizedin advance to enable Hongkong to hold out during the period before relief.  In this connexion he hoped that the matter  would receive careful attention, and that nothing would be done which might be interpreted as an infringement  of the washington treaty and might lead to, the building  up of new fortifications in the  forbiddenarea.&quot;    In fact, however, the policy of the Service Departments in the last 2 years hasbeen constantly directed towards the strengthening of Hongkong as a naval, militaryand air base.  Last winter it was decided to establish an aerodrome there, ostensiblyfor Civil  aviation, but really  for defence purposes;  arrangements are being madeto provide a certain number of  anti-aircraft guns;  increase of  range of  the coast defences is contemplated  (C.I.D., 235th Meeting); and  now it is proposed to treblethe permanent garrison by the addition of two British battalions.    It is submitted that  in present circumstances measures directed against  analleged Japanese menace are an unnecessary and undesirable waste of public money,only calculated to disturb our existing good relations with that country.      ,ii    8.  Finally, it is  submitted that  the  present  proposal  is at least premature.There can be  no need  for  an  immediate decision so long as an  emergency  force is retained  in China. The first step should  be to secure  a further reduction of the shanghai Force;. and the Treasury urge that the Army Council should now,be invitedto consider, in consultation with the Foreign Office and the Admiralty, whetheranother 2 battalions and the armoured car company  can  shortly be withdrawn.  It isalso a question whether, as the danger of any sudden  external  attack seems, to  bebecoming remote, the  International Settlement at Shanghai should not be expectedto provide for its own internal security, so  as  to  enable  the British forces, to  be completely withdrawn at an early date.    It will be time enough when these steps have been taken to consider what british garrison  should be permanently maintained in China.                       t
