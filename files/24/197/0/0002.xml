[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government. 1               Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1928.SECRET.                                                     Copy No.    21CP.  252  (28).CABINET.RATES  OF PENSIONS  OF THE FIGHTING SERVICES-.        Report of Committee on the Rates of Pay of the Fighting Services.     ON the 10th February, 1926, the Cabinet agreed :-         &quot;That the Secretary for Scotland&apos;s Committee on the Rates of Pay of the     Fighting Services should be re-assembled to consider the revision of the rates of     Service Pensions.&quot;   (Reference Cabinet 4 (26), Conclusion 4.)     2.  The Committee had before them the proposals for the revision of  service pensions of men  which were submitted to the Treasury by  the Admiralty and WarOffice in accordance with the directions given by the  Cabinet on  the 13th October,1925.   (Reference  Cabinet  48 (25),  Conclusion  3.)    These proposals  differedwidely  both  in principle  and in the extent of  the reductions suggested.   As the pension systems of the three Services are, in their essentials, on identical lines, theCommittee considered that  it was most desirable that a common basis  of revisionshould be adopted.  Accordingly, after examining the Admiralty and  War office proposals,  and after  discussion with  the representatives  of all  the Departmentsconcerned,  they referred back the whole question for inter-Departmental considera-tion with a view to alternative schemes being submitted to  them which would beeach capable of application  to all the Services.   As a result a considerable measureof agreement between the Departments was eventually reached.     3.  Service Pensions do not depend in any way on rates of pay.  As revised in1919, they  are made up of a basic element of \\d. a day for each year&apos;s full-time service, together  with additions (varying with  rank)  for each year in  the  migher ranks (e.g., for each year as Petty Officer or Sergeant, Id. a day is added).   In theNavy the full rank elements  are only granted to men with very good character.  TheNavy also make special additions for good conduct badges, very good  character, andto pensioners awarded the good conduct medal.     4.  In addition to the pension determined by the above factors and  payable ondischarge, an age addition of 5d. a day is granted when the pensioner reaches theage of 55.  At 65 the  pensioner becomes eligible for benefits under the contributory pensions Act.     5.  As compared with pre-war, the principal feature of  the 1919 revision wasthe trebling of the  service element  (l^d. a day  instead of  \d. a  day).   The rankadditions for Naval pensioners were left entirely unchanged.  Consequently,  thelower ranks received proportionately far greater  increases than the higher ranks, asis shown by the following figures : \--	Pre-war.	1919.	Increase,Navy  Average pension of A.B.&apos;s P-0.&apos;s...... C.P.0/8...... O.P.O.&apos;s (E.R.A.) ..

     6.   It is necessary to have-regard to this characteristic of the 1919 revision in considering the basis of reduction appropriate at the present time.  If all pensionswere reduced proportionately to an extent commensurate with the fall in the costof  living  since  1919,  the rates  applicable  to the senior ranks would compare unfavourably with those in force before the war.     7. :  It should be pointed out that the above outline of the pension scheme includesno  reference to disability pensions.   As  the  Cabinet  have recently been informed(CP. 326 (28)), it is not proposed to alter the post-war disability elements of pension.The revision now contemplated relates only to pensions granted  for  service, andfuture disability pensioners  will only  be affected by it in so far as they may receiveby virtue of long service pensions greater than the disability elements alone.     8.   A reduction in the  pension scales will only apply to new entrants.  Thiswould be a necessary consequence of a decision given in 1925 in regard to pay, but apart from that decision, soldiers now serving have, under  the Army Pay Warrant,vested rights in regard to pensions.  The normal periods of service to complete timefor pension are 21 years for the Army, 22 years for the Navy, and 24 years for theRoyal Air Force.  New scales of pension will not take effect to any appreciable extent in the three Services until these periods have expired.     9.   It is generally agreed that the increased purchasing value of money at thepresent time, as compared with  1919, calls for a reduction of the present pensionscales.   It is not, however, considered  that Service Pensions should be subject to any system of variation dependent on cost of living figures.  No such adjustments are provided for in the present Service Pension regulations, or in connection with pay,and the  fact that new scales of pension will not be effective for many years makesthis course clearly undesirable.     10.  After considering various alternatives, the Committee are of opinion thatthe only  satisfactory basis of revision  lies in the reduction of the service element  ofpension,  leaving unchanged the rank elements.   To provide  for an  appropriatemeasure  of adjustment, it is necessary to place the service element on a weekly insteadof a daily  basis, and the Committee are satisfied that the practical alternatives areto substitute  for the present  element of \\d. a day for each year of service (10-^. aweek), either an element df Sd. a week or one of %\d. a week.   In addition, an adjust-ment of  the good conduct, &amp;c, elements peculiar  to Naval  pensions is desirable,  inorder to equalise, as far as is practicable, the average effect of the reduction on navy and Army pensions respectively.   Details of the changes which would be made onthese two bases are given  in Appendix I.  Their effect on actual rates of pensionappropriate to the various ranks is shown in Appendix II.     11.  The ultimate financial effect  of these reductions is estimated  as follows :               Service Element.                 8d. a Week.           S^d. a Week.      Navy  ...    ...     ...    ...       1S&quot;35 per cent.      14-8 percent.      Army............       18&quot;5               14&quot;8or, in terms of total saving, assuming the forces remain at their present strengths                                                            .        Navy  ...    ...     ...    ...    587,000 per annum   473,000 per annum.      Army (including Indian share)    640,000     ,,         515,000    .,,                 Total    ...     ...  1,227,000 per annum   *)88,000 per annum.    12.  In the case of the Royal Air Porce, conditions are not sufficiently stabilisedto enable corresponding figures to be given,  but it can be taken that the percentageeffect will not differ greatly from that shown for the Navy and Army.  Neither basiswill produce  savings to the full extent originally proposed by the Admiralty.  Sincethe reduction proposed falls more heavily, proportionately, on the lower ranks thanon the higher ranks, careful  regard must be given to its effect on the Able Seamanand the Private Soldier.   The case of  the  former is not considered of importance,since a relatively small proportion.of Naval ratings are discharged  as Able seamen and the Naval pension scale is more favourable than that of the Army.   On the other
hand, recent statistics show that 24 per cent, of the soldiers discharged to pension arePrivates.   The Army Council are of opinion that even to reduce the service elementto 8d.  a week would reduce the Private&apos;s pension more than is desirable, and theyconsider that the alternative of 8\d. a week should be adopted.    13.  In Appendix III will be found a statement showing (1) the pre-war pension rates increased proportionately on  the  basis of an estimated  average Ministry ofLabour cost of living index figure for 1928; and (2) the 1919 rates reduced proportion-ately according to the cost of living index figures for 1919 and 1928.  The Committeeare of opinion that these figures on  the whole indicate that it is not unreasonable toadopt the service element of 8^. a week in preference to 8\d. a week.  In the case ofthe Army Private, the typical pension payable on discharge will be  36 10s. per annumas compared with   33 4s. per annum obtained by adjusting the  1914 pension, and 38 8s. per annum obtained by adjusting the 1919 pension.    14.  The Committee are also influenced by the fact that any revision of pensionscales does not take effect for many years  owing to the vested  rights for servingpersonnel which must be admitted.  The future course of the cost of living, i.e., the purchasing value of money, cannot be foreseen  at the present  time.  If conditions should arise wherein  the  pension rates now fixed become too low, there will  be nodifficulty in making an upward revision.  On the other hand a downward revisioncould only be undertaken  with further recognition of vested rights.    15.  The possible effect on recruiting of the adoption of one of these alternativesas opposed to the  other has been considered.  The Committee are of opinion thatrecruiting is not likely to be affected by the actual figure adopted. ^ Any reduction inpension rates may be expected to have some adverse effect on recruiting, particularly at the time the change is made.  The effect will, however, lie in  the fact of reductionrather  than in its precise extent.    16.  The Committee  accordingly  recommend  to  the  Cabinet that  service pensions  in the  three Fighting  Services should be  revised  on the basis  of alternative A set out in Appendix I.
