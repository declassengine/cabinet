AITHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) .7u[SECRET.                                     COPY NO; C gFo 259 (28),                            CABINET,    WESTERN HIGHLANDS STEAMER SERVICES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for            &apos;   Scotland&quot;    (Previous Papers  CeF, 241 (28).la   The Report of the Select Committee on this subject(House of Commons Paper 117) recommends for the Government&apos;consideration two schemes submitted jointly by Sir Josiah Stampand Sir Alfred Read on behalf of the London Midland and scottish Railway Company and Coast Lines, Ltd.., respectivelyunder each of which schemes a new company would be formed totake over the services hitherto rendered by David MacBrayneLtd-   The first scheme is, with certain modifications, that.,.,summarized In CP. 241 (28)j  the second scheme differs from it mainly in providing, for a fluctuating subsidyaccording to the returns of trading.   For convenience the main features of the schemes are appended to this Memorandumalongside the terms proposed under the contract from whichMessrs. MacBrayne resiled.2a    After preliminary conferences with the representativesjOf the L.M.S. and Const Lines and with the Treasury and otherDepartments concerned I am  disposed to prefer the first scheme with a fixed payment.   Examination of this scheme with theinformation at my disposal  indicates that in all probabilitya settlement on the basis of a payment of  50,000 will be afavourable one for the Government especially if, as I hope,I can  succeed  in securing within that limit greater concessions in respect of reduced, freights and fares than the 10^offered.   I have considered whether it would be practicable to reduce  commitments by ax&apos;ranging for a modification of these     .    :   ..            &apos;.   -l-.
 proposals,  but  I. an satisfied  that from  the  Parliamentary  point  of view  it  is  impossible  to whittle down the recommendations  of the Select Committee  in this respect. 3.    I therefore  propose to concentrate  on Scheme 1 and to endeavour to  secure  an agreement to reductions of freight and fare revenue  of  approximately 12j$  within the limits of the  50,000 annual subsidy.   I  also hope  that it may be possible to obtain some modification in the Government Ts favour of the terms as to sharing  of  surplus  profits, but I cannot at the moment make a definite statement  on  this.    It Is,  however, essential that an agreement should be reached without delay, as otherwise I fear that great difficulties (probably resulting in an increased State liability) may arise In connection with the arrangements for taking over the  existing MacBrayne concern and in preventing a breakdown in the services.   I therefore desire the Cabinet!s general authority to make the best bargain I  can within the commitments of one or other of the.  schemes, subject  to consultation with the Treasury. 4.   I also desire to have authority  for the Introduction at thebeginning of next Session of a Bill to confer necessary powers. The position is that Sir Josiah Stamp has me.de it an absolute condition of his Company&apos;s participation in the undertaking not only that the Company  shall be relieved of all expense in obtaining powers (See CP. 241(28)) but also that satisfactory assurances are given that the Government will pass the necessary legislation (of which he wishes  to see an  &quot;acceptable draft&quot;).   Without entering in detail  Into the difficulties which arise in given Sir Josiah  a  sufficiently firm assurance In this matter, I may say that the Departments have reached the conclusion that a public Bill so drafted  as if  possible not  to involve Hybrid Bill procedure is the best, if  not  the only way, of surmounting these difficulties.
    5o   Whcit is in view is a Bill to empower, the Minister of Transport in consultation with the Secretary of State to authorise any Railway Company to  take and hold sliares in a Company operatins services In the Western Highlands and Islands.   It cannot unfortunately he assumed that such a Bill  would not he treated by the  Parliamentary Authorities as  a  hybrid Bill,  involving reference to  a Select Committee, and Sir Jcsiah Stamp,  on  behalf of his Company may doc line to  accept such a  Bill.  But,  as there are grave  difficulties in  widening the scope  of  the  Bill so as to assure its  being treated as  a Public  G-eneral Bill,  I can only  tell him  that the Government.will  undertake  the introduction of such a  Bill in  the  House,  at  the same  time  expressing the  view that no difficulty will arise  in  securing  its passage, and undertaking that  if for  any reason the necessary powers are  not  obtained the Government will  indemnify the new Company  for any expenditure  incurred  in anticipation of the scheme going through.,    6.     In order  to meet a very difficult situation,  I ask my colleagues  for authority to  promise  the necessary-.legislation early next Session,  and to give the  nesessary  undertaking as to  indemnity.   I anticipate that  legislation on  the  lines proposed will be acceptable to the  Opposition  Parties  in theHouse in view  of the unanimous  Report  of  the Select Committee. The Minister  of Transport wishes  to  make  it clear that  a Bill of  this kind,  enabling a Department  to  confer  powers normally conferred  only by Parliament, would  be  an innovation,  and he has some  apprehension that it may arouse  criticism.  He does not, however,  in  the special circumstances,  dissent from the proposal,  to  which there appears  to  be  no  alternative,      7.    Two  further  questions should  be  mentioned.   I understand  that the  Postmaster  General  desires that he  should be  relieved  of the responsibility for entering into the contract  with  the new  Company.  So  far as this is  based upon
        doubts as to the Postmaster General1s power to enter into        the proposed contract, I should like  to observe first that        the new contract will be similar in character to the        contract made by the Postmaster General in April last,        which was laid before Parliament,   Secondly,  that it is        essential that a new contract should  be made  before        Parliament reassembles.   I feel that,  in the  circumstances,        in order that the Government  may be saved from serious        difficulty,  there is no  practicable alternative  to  the        continuance  of past  practice  by the Post Office  and to  their        making a contract, even  though it  may  technically be ultra.        vires^   No  other Government  Department has the  power to        make  such a  contract,                 Secondly, it should  be mentioned that both of  the        schemes submitted contemplate that there should  be  two        Government Directors on  the Board  of the new  Company.        There are arguments  on both sides., and I think it        desirable that  I should  have  a free hand to  decide the        question as  best I can in the further  negotiations.
