I ATTACH a memorandum prepared in the Treasury in regard to the Britishsilver coin in  the  Irish  Free State.   It is  very clear that the Irish Free StateGovernment will not willingly accept any arrangement other than one which sooner or later fastens on the British Exchequer a loss  of some  1,800,000, the differencebetween the face value and the bullion value  of the British silver coin, and therebyenables the Irish Free State to make a clear  profit of roughly equal amount out oftheir new issue.  Before proceeding further with the negotiations,  I should like to consult my colleagues on the question whether I may do so on the basis that unless a satisfactory compromise is reached with Mr. Cosgrave we shall pass the necessary legislation.                                                                    w.  s. c.    Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,           July 31, 1928.            BRITISH  COIN  IN  THE  IRISH FREE  STATE.                        MEMORANDUM BY  THE TREASURY.    The Irish  Free State is introducing a new currency  of its own, including a,new issue of silver coin.   On the 23rd  May last the Cabinet considered whether legislation should be introduced prohibiting the return to this country of the British.silver coin  circulating in the  Irish Free State.  This  coin is estimated  to  amount.to circa  3,000,000 in face value, including some  500,000 held by banks in Dublinas cover to their note issue.   The silver  coin, if returned,  could not  be put to any use in this country :  its sole value here,  namely,  its  bullion value,  is only about40 per cent, of face value.   The difference  (say,   1,800,000) would, except for asmall  fraction^  be a Budget  outgoing.  If the Irish Free State authorities used the metal of the existing coin to  strike their new coinage, they would, it appears, beput to no expense and might make a small  profit; their new coinage is of much thesame  fineness as, or slightly less fineness than, the average fineness of the differentclasses  of  British  silver now circulating in  Ireland.  If  the Irish  Free Stateauthorities refuse  to  do  this and strike  their new  coinage from bullion bought inthe market, they would make  a profit probably in the  region of  1,800,000.    *In  the Treaty the Irish  Free State was left free to put out a coinage of its own -ynothing, on the other hand, was provided  to invalidate or demonetise the existingsilver coin  there.   The British Government  is under no obligation in any  circum-stances to take back silver coin (other than worn coin) at its face value.    The Cabinet ruling on the 23rd May is recorded in the following terms : * .    &quot; The Cabinet agreed-    (a.) That the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who  undertook to keep in touch           with the Secretary of State for. Dominion Affairs on the subject, should[18031J* Cabinet 30 (28), Conclusion 11.
           discuss the matter with the President of the Executive Council and the           Minister of Finance of the Irish Free State, with a view to arriving at           some arrangement.  Mr.  Churchill should have discretion, if he thought           fit, to show the Bill  to the representatives  of the Irish Free State, in           order to prove the power, and the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government           in Great Britain to prevent the dumping of silver in  this country.  He          ; should also have authority, if necessary, to make some concession whereby           some portion  of the silver involved might be returned gradually to this           country, spread over a period of years.    (b.)  That the use of the word &apos; foreign &apos; (as applying to all countries outside the           United Kingdom) should be avoided in the Bill.&quot;    Oh the 13th June the Chancellor wrote to Mr.  Cosgrave, and he replied on theSth July as follows :     &quot; My dear Mr. Churchill,         I have now  been  able  to consider the question which  your  letter of the    13th ultimo raises as to the future of the token coinage at present circulating    here.  Now that it has been raised, both Mr. Blythe with  whom  I  have    discussed-your letter and 1 are glad of the opportunity of going;into it fully.    Your letter shows, I think,  that our position is not clearly understood on your    side.  When the  change of Government took, place here it was always regarded    as a logical consequence Of that change and of the fiscal independence which  -  accompanied it that, among our other national institutions, we should, have a    coinage of  our.own.  Apart altogether from the Australian and South African    precedents, it would be unreasonable  to  regard  this simply  as  a matter of ,   sentiment for which we ought to be prepared to pay a price.  If there were    anything unexpected or unusual in our programme, we could understand your    reluctance to take back at face value the British tokens,which are to. be replaced;    but we feel that, while we are proceeding on normal lines, the attitude taken up    by your Government is exceptional,  having regard to the very different arrange-    ments-made by you-with the  Union of  South Africa  and Australia when  they    began to issue their own coinage.         You might, as you  suggest,  prohibit by  legislation the importation of token    coins from  the Saorstat into  Great Britain, but the situation you propose to    create is not  one which would be readily  understood by the people of this    country.  While  they were generally aware  that the intrinsic value of the coins    was less than their currency  value, they were satisfied that the fact that the coins    were issued by the Royal Mint under the authority of the British Government    was a guarantee that they were good for their full face value.  People here would    be slow to believe that you now propose to regard the coins as being merely    equivalent in value to the bullion which they contain, and I can give you a most    positive assurance that any such attitude on your  part would  present itself to    them as an act of repudiation which could  not fail to strengthen  the hands of    persons advocating  a  like  attitude  towards  obligations to  the  British    Government.         I may mention that there is a considerable body of opinion in this  country    which does not share your  view as to the  generosity of the terms which we    received under the Ultimate Financial Settlement.   In any case, that Settlement  V did not involve questions of coinage or currency and has not prejudiced the issue    of currency notes here  or the withdrawal of the Treasury notes at present in.    circulation.  Presumably, if we offered to return the coins in part payment of  &apos;-. some of our obligations under the  Ultimate Financial Settlement,  you would    object on the ground that they were not legal tender;  but,, however reasonable    it might be as between third parties to stand on such a legal technicality,; it    would be difficult to convince us that it was equitable as between the issuing    authority  and the  people  of this country.   I  may  further  observe,  in  this  *  connection, and this is  a most important point, that in return for these tokens    you obtained the full measure of their face value in the shape of goods.         In regard to the point  made by  you that  you  cannot absorb; this silver as    you already have   millions stored away in the Bank of England, I  think you    will agree, on consideration,  that it  cannot reasonably be held that  the whole    body of token coins in this country should be treated in the same fashion as the  :  accumulations made by  your banks and railway companies in  the&quot; course  of their    business.
         L would draw your attention to the fact that the amount&apos;involved in the   : present  discussion is; only   737,262 10s.,  and,  while we; are convinced that     the British Government are under an obligation to take back the coins- at their ;    face value, we do not urge  that the entire stock of coins should be returned at i-   once.  Instead, it would be  sufficient for the moment if enough were removed to     make way for the new issue; the balance could be withdrawn later, perhaps in     instalments, in accordance  with some arrangement to be  made between us in     regard to them.   I may add  that, in our opinion, the figure of   3,000,000     mentioned by you as our circulation  of token coins is much top high. -         I  am putting forward the above considerations in the hope that they may     weigh with your colleagues  and yourself in your deliberations on this  question.     I am naturally anxious that the change over to the new coinage should be made     with the goodwill and co-operation of: all the parties interested.  I may mention     here that while the choice of an English artist to execute the whole  series of     designs was purely on the grounds of merit, our action in placing the contract     with the Royal Mint was due not alone to the desire to obtain the services of   &quot;  such an efficient organisation, but  also to - our belief that the placing of the     contract in London would be appreciated and might have a favourable  influence :    in effecting a smooth transition to the new-coinage                                     With all good wishes,                                         Believe me,                                          ;    Yours sincerely,                                       (Signed)      -WILLIAM&apos;  T.  COSGRAVE.&quot;     Mr. Cosgrave refers early in his letter to the arrangements we made with SouthAfrica and Australia when they  began to issue  their own silver coinage.   Eacharrangement was one for taking back our silver in instalments over a long  periodof years.  The arrangement with Australia was made prior to the War when we were able to use  the returned silver without any loss to ourselves.  The arrangement with south Africa was more  recent and it constitutes  a more difficult precedent.  Ourwithdrawals  from Australia and South  Africa  are being made slowly  ( 100,000 ayear) over long periods.  The withdrawal from Australia began in 1910 and  is stillgoing on.   The withdrawal from South Africa began in 1922 and will probably goon to 1937.     Mr. Cosgrave&apos;s most impressive and  least justified statement is that if  we leavethe silver in Ireland, it will be taken as an act of repudiation. There is no real sensein this unless Mr. Gosgrave means to imply that  the silver will be left surplus inthe hands of the common people or the  Banks in  Ireland, and  they will find theyhave no use for it except to sell it at bullion value. This ingeniously begs the question.There is a silver coinage now in  circulation in the Irish Free State. If the Govern-ment wish  to substitute  another, the only  reasonable course that they all pursueis  to issue  the new coinage in exchange  for  the old.   In this way the old coinageautomatically comes into the hands of  the Free  State Government.   The proper course is for the Government to use the  old coin as it  comes in for the striking ofthe new coins.  They  can adopt  this course probably at a small profit to themselves as the new  coins will  be rather less fine than the old ones.   There is no question ofrepudiation;  only a question of stamping an existing stock of metal into a  differentoutward form.   The Irish Free  State could only begin to speak about repudiationif  they were entitled to  argue that  they have an  absolute right to order our coinout of the countrjr,  and then fill  up the gap  with new coin of their own.    Mr. Cosgrave next says that the settlement,did not involve questions of coinageor  currency and has not prejudiced the issue of currency notes or the withdrawal ofthe Treasury notes at  present in circulation.   The difference is this.  Currency Notesare legal tender for any amount and convertible into bar gold.  If, therefore, theIrish Free  State Government decides to  displace them by  a currency of their ownthey have only to bring in the notes and we are powerless to avoid paying for them.But silver is not legal tender (except in insignificant amounts), and we are under no obligation to take it back.    Mr. Cosgrave then suggests  that he would be entitled to return the coins in partpayment of obligations under the  ultimate financial settlement, and  that our onlysafeguard would be what he describes as &quot;the technicality that they are not legaltender.&quot;  This is mere dialectic.   Clearly the ultimate financial settlement must bemade in legal tender,  and there is no sort of obligation upon us to accept token coin.
    His next point is that in return for this token:coin we have received, full measureat face, value in the shape of goods.   This is, of course, true in the sense that it was issued for money&apos;or money&apos;s worth, but it is quite irrelevant to the question whether,when issuing a new token  coinage of their own,, the Irish Free State government ought to absorb the existing metal.   Moreover,  the surplus of the money received for silver coins over the cost of providing them is  an ordinary Budget receipt usedto relieve taxation.   Down  to the separation these receipts went to  the JointExchequer, and were as much for the benefit of-the  Irish as for the British taxpayer.The Irish taxpayer has had his share of any profit  already.    Mr. Cosgrave then refers to the fact that h\  millions  are already stored awayin the Bank of England, and  says that it cannot reasonably be held that the Irishsilver should be treated  in the same fashion as  the accumulations made by ourBanks, &amp;c, in the course of business.  This mis-states the  case.   The accumulationin the Bank of England is really due to the fact that less silver is required in active-circulation in this country than was required in the period of high prices at the endof the War.  It is redundant just as the British silver in Ireland will be redundant,but it is our own normal redundancy and not a redundancy artificially  created byexecutive action of a Dominion in discarding our currency in favour of a new one.    It should be added that when Mr. Cosgrave refers to the amount involved in thepresent discussion as being, only  737,000, he refers, so it appears, to the face value-of a first instalment of new silver which  his Government proposes to put out in thenext few months.          &quot;    Another currency question but one of much smaller dimensions is also in issuebetween the Treasury and the Irish authorities.   The Joint Stock Banks in Irelandhave long had the right of issuing private bank notes.   Substantial numbers of notes-issued by the Irish Banks during the last eighty years or so have been lost or destroyed and will never be brought in for payment.  The profit on these &quot; dead &quot; notes is not allowed to accrue to the Banks.   The Banks are required to continue to  hold  our-currency notes as cover against them, and the profits thus become part of our profits of issue.  The Irish Free State Government claim that the Irish Banks should be relieved of the obligation to keep cover against the dead notes, and should be allowedto return the Currency Notes acting as cover for the dead notes in the Irish FreeState and receive money for them from the British Exchequer, in order that the IrishFree State may be left free to subject the amount represented by the dead notes to anannual tax.   The claim is not a reasonable one,  and the Irish Free State authoritiesshould be asked  to forgo1 their contention in this  respect, as on? of the terms of any&quot;arrangement that may be reached for taking back part of our silver from them. -Treasury Chambers, July 31,1928.
