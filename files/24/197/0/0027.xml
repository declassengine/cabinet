This document is  the  property of His Britannia Majesty&apos;a Government,150Printed for the  Cabinet,  October, 1928.SECRET.                                                                    COPT No.  p C.P.  278  (28).THE CABINET.FUTURE  BRITISH  GARRISONS  IN  CHINA.               (Former paper CP. 136 (28).)        MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  WAR.     1. In April last I put forward for the consideration of my colleagues a memorandum .  ^jj prepared  by the  Chief of the Imperial  General Staff (CP.  136  (28) ) making certain .  Abroad proposals for the  immediate reduction of the forces in China.  In this memorandum  the view was  expressed that an addition of at least 4 battalions would be required for our Far Eastern garrisons (viz., 1 at Singapore, 2 at Hong Kong and 1 at  Tientsin, as explained in C.I.D Paper 847-B), on the ground that our original post-war garrison  of 3 battalions (2  British and  1 Indian)  distributed  between  Hong Kong  and Tientsin  had been inadequate to cope with the present emergency, and  sufficient troops  must be located in China to obviate the necessity of sending  reinforcements from England should a similar situation arise in the future.     This memorandum was considered at the Cabinet meeting held on  2nd May,  1928 (Cabinet 26 (28), item  3).                                &quot;     2. Further consideration has confirmed me in the view  that our future permanent garrison in China must  include three additional British infantry battalions, of which two should be stationed at Hong Kong and one at Tientsin.   The  question  of accommodation for  the extra battalions  at Hong Kong requires  early  decision.  My  advisers  have considered  alternative  sites  and  have  discussed  the  matter   with the  Governor, who  has   given  an  assurance that  the  Colonial Government will  raise no objection to  the concessions  involved  in  the  . scheme.  .  If  provision  is  to   be   made   in Estimates, 1929, for beginning the construction of these barracks (which even so would not all be ready for occupation by the end  of  1930),  instructions must be  given to that effect at once.  Events in China are likely to move rapidly :  the military situation  in Shanghai  has recently shown improvement, and  a state of affairs may soon be reached which will permit of a start being made with the redistribution of our troops in China  to meet our  requirements  in connection with the ultimate permanent garrisoning of the country.     3.1 therefore ask the Cabinet to approve in principle the fixing of the  future british garrison in  China at five battalions (in addition to the Indian battalion) in order that Imay take  immediate steps  to discuss with the  Treasury the  details of the provision  of accommodation for the two additional  battalions to be located at Hong Kong.                                                                       L. W.-E.  THE WAS OFFICE,        2nd October, 1928.                                                                *
