I  CIRCULATE,  for  the  information and consideration of  the  Cabinet,  amemorandum  prepared in  the Treasury  on  the  subject  of  &quot; Ex-Service  CivilServants.&quot;                                                                    w. s. c.    Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,         October.!, 1928.                          EX-SERVICE CIVIL SERVANTS.     ON the 28th August the &quot;Times&quot; printed  a letter under the above title  (see Appendix A to  this memorandum) from  four Members  of Parliament  protesting against the issue of notices of discharges to a number of temporary employees in the Government.     2.   The human sympathy for a man who may lose his job is naturally enhanced by the very proper sentiment which the word &quot; ex-Service &quot; evokes;  and, as this may tend to obscure the position, it should be explained at the outset that the  phrase, as used by  these unfortunate men and the trade-union which speaks for them, gives (no  doubt unintentionally) quite a false impression  so far as the Civil  Service is concerned.  The 5,000 temporary employees* for whom the Association of  ex-Service Civil  Servants is moving, and  to whom the letter  refers,  are  the residue  of approximately 30,000 men clerks taken on at the end of the War (for 25,000 of whom assured employment has been  found),  and  it is these men alone who describe them- selves, and who are spoken of, as &quot; ex-Service &quot; Civil Servants.  In fact, however, they constitute only  about 20 per cent, of the  total number of  ex-Service Civil Servants, approximately 120,000 other civilian employees of Government having also served with the Colours during the war.     It follows, therefore, that the 5,000  men referred to  in  the  letter  constitute not -gth, but   th of the ex-Service civilian employees of the State.     3.  As already indicated, 25,000. out of this particular 30,000 men have already been given regular employment  (16,000  established jobs,  9,000  permanent non- pensionable ones).   .  The average standard of these 25,000 is definitely below that of recruits by open competitive examinations; for this a  price has to be paid  in  lower efficiency and larger numbers, and the Parliamentary and Press champions of these men&apos;s claims are inconsistent when, having effected their immediate object,  they  then criticise the Service for inefficiency and redundancy.     4.  In addition,  provision is made for appointment to established vacancies of any  of the 9,000 permanent non-pensionable employees who  are found fit  for it; as   * It is to a certain number of these  men that notices of discharge were issued by Departments nolonger needing them;  but as explained in  paragraph 8 below, a demand from  other Departments for temporary men is providing work for them.       [18230]                                                     &apos;    B
regards the residual 5,000,  every third  wastage vacancy in the permanent non-pensionable class  is  made  available for  suitable men among  these 5,000;  and,furthermore, a  Government pledge has  been given that  no efficient*  temporaryex-Service clerk shall be dismissed to make room for successful candidates recruitedby open competition, and that  the appointment to the Civil Service of successfulcandidates so recruited shall not affect the special promotion of well-qualified membersof the permanent non-pensionable class.     5.  The balance  of 5,000 (out of the 30,000), of course, represent a still loweraverage standard  of efficiency;  for they  are, in the main, a  residuum who have repeatedly failed  to  reach the  low  educational  standard fixed  for  the  qualifyingexaminations by  which ex-Service  temporary clerks  have been  admitted to  the established Clerical Classes.     6.  There are two considerations which are relevant for mention at this stage,before dealing  further  with  the fate of the  5,000 :  these are      (a) the Chancellor of the Exchequers 1928 programme for a reduction of Civil           Service numbers by 11,127 (see Appendix (B) to this memorandum);     (b) the 1927 pronouncement of the Select Committee on Estimates in favour of           recruitment by open competition  (see Appendix (C)).These two matters are inter-related;  for the success of the staff reduction programmeoutlined in the  Budget  is dependent (inter  alia) upon recruits  into the permanentCivil Service over the next five  years  being fully  up to normal standard.  the reductions contemplated will only prove possible if Departments are at liberty to recruit candidates of the right age and the right calibre by open competition.  Anyfurther dilution of the established clerical,  &amp;c, classes resulting  from recruitmentotherwise than by open competition  would have to be heavily paid for.     7.  The reference in the M.P.s&apos; letter to the Prime Ministers letter to employers,following on the issue of the Industrial Transference Board5s report, is, of course, acomplete  red herring which may, nevertheless, be used  unfairly against the Govern-ment. The position of the miners is that there are scores of thousands of first-rateworkmen whom any  employer should be  glad to get;  and on the other  hand theseunfortunate clerks are  for the most part completely below the requisite standard of efficiency.     8.  There is,  in  fact, no immediate question of turning any of these 5,000 menadrift.  Actually, at the present time, ex-Service  temporary clerks are not beingdischarged  from  the Civil  Service; for  such of them as become  redundant in one department further employment is at  once available  in other Departments, e.g.,the  Ministry of Labour and the Inland  Revenue Department, where extra staff  istemporarily needed to meet the growing requirements of the unemployment situationand the increased volume of work resulting from the Governments derating scheme.This phase will of course not last indefinitely.     9.  Although discharges are not imminent, the demand that these men  shallbe permanently retained will certainly be revived when  the House meets in november and it will  then be necessary for the Government to announce its policy.     10.   The attitude of the Union is notwithstanding its 1925 acceptance of thepresent arrangements  already  summarised that nothing will satisfy  it short ox an arrangement which  will protect the whole body of ex-Service temporary clerksfrom discharge.     The  proposals made by it  for the removal  of the ex-Service  temporary clerks5problem have taken different forms.  One proposal is that, for  the next three years, 75 per cent, of all  vacancies arising in  the Established Clerical  Classes should be earmarked  for  ex-Service men now in  the Civil Service, and it is maintained  that, if this proposal  were  adopted, it would not be found necessary to discharge  any ex Service temporary clerks from the Civil  Service.  A second  proposal is that the Government should, here and now, give permanent status to all ex-Service temporary- clerks.   A third proposal  takes the  form  of  a recommendation  that  ex-Service temporary clerks  should be appointed, as the work on which they are engaged comes to an end&quot; in wastage vacancies arising in the Writing Assistant Class (Women).     * This means &quot; efficient&quot; according to the laxer standards applied to these men.  The arrangements outlined in  paragraphs 3 and 4 were in 1925 accepted by the men&apos;s Union as a Final Settlement.
     The  demand for the earmarking of 75  per cent,  of,  indeed, of  any otherproportion of vacancies in the Established Clerical Classes is an impossible one.  The1925 Agreement  already provides for  the continuing promotion to  those classes ofpermanent non-pensionable clerks who  are deemed to- be qualified for the work which.is required of members of those classes, and up to the present 480 such clerks havebeen given promotion. It is known that Departments generally have been at pains topromote wherever promotion could, by any means,  be justified.   This  process of selection will continue so long as there are suitable candidates to promote.  For therest, so far as appointments to this class may be necessary, it is imperative to securecandidates of open competition standard.  Already departmental machinery is in danger of breakdown owing to shortage  of clerks of the right calibre (e.g.,  in theMinistry of Health,  where the arrangements for bringing the derating scheme  intoforce are  being seriously affected from this cause).  The next open  competition for admission to the  Established Clerical  Class is  due to be held in the spring of nextyear, and it is essential that  a preliminary announcement to prospective candidatesshould be  made without further delay.     The second proposal put forward by the  Association, namely, that the whole body of ex-Service temporary clerks  should be given a  guarantee of permanent employment,  is also  impossible.  In guaranteeing permanency  to 9,000  temporaryclerks  under  the  terms of the  Guinness Agreement, the Government were already taking a serious risk of eventual redundancy.   They would certainly not be justifiedin agreeing to a revised settlement which  left Government  Departments with no margin whatever  in the form of a temporary fringe.     As regards the third proposal, namely,  that ex-Service temporary clerks shouldbe appointed in wastage vacancies in the Writing Assistant  Class (Women), on theone hand  it cannot be maintained that the ex-Service temporary clerks have failedto satisfy any prescribed test for admission to this Class, and it may be argued thatthe work of a Writing Assistant is less important and requires less intelligence thanthe work of a  Clerical Officer, and that an ex-Service temporary clerk who has been unable to  pass the prescribed  test for admission to the Clerical-Class may still suffice for the inferior work of the Writing Assistant  Class.  On the other hand, it cannotbe gainsaid that the prime qualifications of a Writing Assistant are quickness of eyeand hand, and accuracy;  that for duties requiring these qualifications girls have beenfound  peculiarly  suited; and that the standard of performance on these duties of ex-Service temporary clerks,  where they have been tried on  them, has  undoubtedlyfallen far short of the open competition standard.  If, therefore, ex-Service temporaryclerks were to be appointed instead of girls on this class of work, the inevitable results would  be  that an increased staff would be required for the work (tests have shownthat  two  women  Writing Assistants  are at least equivalent  to  three  ex-ServiceClerks); that  the work would be done at increased cost; and that a  greatly reducedstandard  of efficiency would  lead  to an  increasing volume of complaints from thegeneral public.   A  decision  on this  basis  would certainly upset the  successfulcompletion of  the programme of staff reductions propounded in this year&apos;s  Budget,one of the conditions of which is that, in so far as recruitment to the Civil Service maybe necessary,  Departments  shall be  free  to  introduce   candidates  of the opencompetition standard.     11.  This third  alternative, with all its defects, is the least objectionable of thethree demands of  the Union, if it were decided for political, as distinct from business,reasons to agree to any of them.  Any such agreement, if decided on, should be  subjectto the  proviso  that  appointments  of  ex-Service temporary  clerks  to WritingAssistants&apos; posts shall be regarded as purely temporary, the clerks so appointed being-transferred to temporary clerical jobs  as they  become available. It should  also bemade a condition of acceptance of this proposal that any ex-Service clerk who is foundto be incompetent shall be discharged.     12.  In conclusion, it is only fair to the Service that its critics should be regularlyreminded  when they  indulge in their  recurrent  diatribes about its inefficiency ornumbers that to the extent to which these charges can be justified at all it is the critics.themselves who are responsible, for it  is  they who have insisted on the dilution ofthe quality by substituting practically indiscriminate absorption for open competitionrecruitment.  And, as mentioned by the Select Committee on Estimates, the ill-effects of lowered standards will be  increasingly felt as time goes on in consequence of the abnormal  age distribution which post-war methods of recruitment have  involved.[18230]
APPENDIX (A).&quot;Times,&quot; August 28, 1928. LETTERS TO THE EDITOR.Ex-Service Civil Servants.                              Government Pledge.                        (To the Editor of the  &quot; Times.&quot;)Sir,    THE Prime Minister, in issuing his personal appeal to large employers to keepas many men in  work as  possible, compels the  undersigned  to  draw  attentionto the anomalous  position in the Civil Service in  regard to the employment of ex-Service men.    Indeed, almost simultaneously with  Mr.  Baldwin&apos;s appeal notices of dismissalhave been issued to a number of ex-Service men holding clerical posts in the CivilService.  They are given notice to leave on grounds that there  is insufficient workfor them, but this plea would be far more effective  were it not that, at the sametime, some hundreds of young men and women have just been given new appointments.We, the signatories to this letter, who spoke on this subject in the House of commons on the 2nd August last, feel strongly that a deserving class were being cast aside.    It is almost  four years  since, largely through the advocacy of your  columns,steps  were taken  to ameliorate the conditions of a large number of ex-Service menwho obtained what is euphemistically termed &apos;&apos; temporary &quot; employment in variousclerical capacities in the Civil Service.  Although  to a,large extent these difficulties were smoothed away, a residue of some 5,000 men were  left out of the arrangements,not necessarily through any fault of their own, but because the Guinness Agreement,as it  was called,  of the 12th January, 1925, only  provided for  the settlement of acertain number.   The plight of these  remaining 5,000 ex-Service temporaries  isto-day thoroughly  unsatisfactory, and  presents a problem  which a considerablenumber of our friends in the House of  Commons believe should be cleared up.    They have served the Government on an  average of from eight to ten years,are men of an average  age  of over 38, are mainly married with families, and areexpected to maintain a position  of decency on a salary  of  3 3s.  11^. (less insurancedeductions),  which will be  reduced on the  1st September next to   3 2s, 4td.Unattractive  as the  existing conditions of  these men are, their  retention  in theService is a case of Hobson&apos;s Choice.  There is very little hope for them to obtainemployment in the commercial world to-day, and yet, after all this continuous  service on the top of war service, these men are  gradually being thrown into unemploymenton the grounds that there is no work for them to do.    In the limited time  afforded on  the  2nd  August, during the debate  on the appropriation Bill  (the session ended the following  day), the position was madeabundantly clear, and indeed not denied,  that the present policy of many GovernmentDepartments  is to give permanent posts to young women called writing assistants,and put them upon clerical work wmich could well be performed by the men, and wasin fact in  most cases performed by them until on grounds mainly  of economy theywere  superseded by these young women; that in the Ministry of Labour (Kew) andin the Ministry of Health (Acton),  to name but two  Departments, within the last few months large numbers of men have  been discharged, whilst the girls have beengiven posts.   To contend that this leads to economy is open to question,  for the bulkof the men are compelled to resort to labour, bureaux and to draw unemploymentpay;  but even apart from this, the  economy when shown is largely illusory, as themen  are upon their  maximum  scale of  salary, Avhereas the.women are entitled  to annual increments, and thus automatically add to the cost, whilst also being entitled to pension rights, estimated by the Treasury to  be worth 12-1 Per  cent, of  their salaries.     It appears to be the policv of the Treasury to-day, under various ways and nretexts, to staff as far as possible minor posts in Government  Departments, either by 3^young  women or  by new entrants to the Service.   This  is surely  a breach  of Government pledges.  On the 27th July, 1927, the then Financial Secretary to the
Treasury, Mr. Ronald  McNeill (now Lord Cushendun), gave  a definite pledge inthe House of Commons that new entrants should not cause the dismissal of ex-Servicetemporaries or prejudice their promotion to the permanent ranks. There is a feeling of disquietude on the part of many Members of Parliament as to the observance of this pledge  and others,  for there  are many instances on record of a considerabletransference of clerks from post to post resulting eventually in  the displacement ofthe  ex-Service temporaries.   The statement  of the Financial Secretary to  theTreasury, Mr.  Samuel,  in  the House of  Commons in the recent debate, referred toabove, only traversed old ground and never attempted to meet the real issue namely,that it will be a blot upon the country&apos;s fair fame if men who have worked efficientlyfor some ten years on the top  of war service are  to be flung into the street to make room for others who have to be taught their work and are not even economical in cost.     The Financial Secretary  on  the same occasion  saw fit to allude to the pledge given by his predecessor,  that &apos;&apos; no efficient temporary ex-Service clerk shall  be dismissed to make room for  any successful candidate in open competition,&quot; andto add that &quot; the  Government are determined to  give effect to that,&quot; and yet on thevery day preceding we are informed that the Ministry of Labour, which dismissed122 ex-Service men last  November, on  grounds of redundancy, had announced thatclerical  vacancies  for 150  boys and  50 girls were to be  allocated to new  entrants,and  100 further posts to young women  writing assistants.   How can it be pretendedthat this is not a contravention of the pledge ?     In 1924 you, Sir, were of opinion that these temporaries should be given securityof tenure.  Four years later the problem arises in yet more  acute form, for  each day the men are older  and find outside employment more difficult to  obtain.  The policyof the Association of Ex-Service Civil  Servants, that all the remaining efficienttemporaries should be given unpensionable permanency, seems  to be the only justsolution to the difficulty, and it has  the further merit that it will not only cost thecountry nothing extra, but may well save public  funds.                                   We are, Sir, your obedient servants,                                                      FREDERICK HALL.                                                       GEORGE H.

CIVIL  STAFF REDUCTION PROGRAMME  (1927-32),    Detailed schemes for the reduction of the staffs (other than industrial staffs) ofCivil  Departments during  the period of five years from the 1st April, 1927, havebeen worked out by the Departments concerned in collaboration with the Treasury.The reductions to be effected are  shown in Table I.  It will be seen  that  in theaggregate they amount  to 11,127, or  18 per cent,  of the total  staff as at the1st April,  1927.           ..    The whole programme of reduction will only prove possible in so far  as thedepartmental estimates are not varied by new legislation or important  decisions ofpolicy entailing considerable increases of staff, and  provided  that the  Ministry ofLabour  in particular is entitled to assume, for the purpose of fixing the numbers ofthe Employment Department, that during the next five years trade will become good and that, so far as may be necessary to meet the requirements of the reduced establish-ments, departments will be at liberty to recruit candidates at the right  age by opencompetition.    In  Table II are shown the reductions effected year by year in the staff of civil departments during the period the 1st April, 1925-the 1st January, 1928, i.e., duringthe lifetime of the present Government.

APPENDIX (C).SELECT  COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES.Extract from Second Report,  1927.                        Recruitment for the Civil Service.     (2) Your Committee think it right to draw attention to the conditions of recruit-ment for the Service since the War, upon which they have heard evidence from theTreasury, and to express some opinion on those arrangements in so far as they havehad a bearing on the increased cost of the  Service to the  State.  During the War,recruitment to the Civil Service by open competition was almost entirely suspended,and, since that date, vacancies in the establishment of the administrative and clericalgrades have been filled almost wholly by limited competition amongst  ex-Servicecandidates.   For the Administrative Class open&apos;competitions were held in 1921 andin  the years  1925  to  1927,  and these supplied,  in  all,  59  candidates, or rather more than one-fifth of the total recruitment to the class  since the War.   For theExecutive Class, no open competition has yet been held.  For the Clerical Classesthere have been, since the War, seven open competitions for Women&apos;s posts, yielding,in all, 1,528 successful candidates, and two reconstruction examinations for.maleclerks in Employment  Exchanges, yielding 1,069 successful candidates.  The resultsof one other open competition,  for candidates of both sexes,  are not  yet available.All other appointments by recruitment, numbering approximately 18,000 to this class,have  been  made by limited  competition from  amongst candidates employed  in  atemporary capacity, most of whom are ex-Service men.     These abnormal arrangements for the recruitment of the Civil Service  have involved considerable relaxation of the educational standard required  of candidates for admission to the Service,  and have also resulted in an abnormal age distribution in the various classes.   Thus, out of approximately 41,500 members of the clericalgroup, to which recruitment would normally be made by  open competition,  amongcandidates of the age  of 16 to 17, only about 4,300 were under the age of 25, and about 700, including 600 women, were under the age of 20 on the  1st April, 1926.These figures, according to the evidence given before your Committee, are approxi-mately one-third of what they would be in normal circumstances.  The administrativedisadvantages inherent in an abnormal age distribution are already serious and willhecome increasingly so as time goes on.  Any lowering, moreover, of the educationalstandard  required  of  candidates for admission to the Service is  likely to reactadversely on administrative efficiency and economy and must tend to a larger numberof people being required to carry out the work of Departments.    Whilst your Committee agree that in the circumstances existing after the warthe arrangements made were appropriate, they consider that, in the interests of futureefficiency, and in view of the urgent need of correcting the existing age distributionwithout delay, steps should be taken, as vacancies arise,  to resume a system of opencompetition with the  intention, on the one hand, of  improving the  standard  of admission to the various classes, and, on the other, of maintaining the regular flow of recruitment to the service at the normal ages.o
