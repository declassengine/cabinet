The attached memorandum, prepared  in  the Treasury,       Is circulated in connection with  the Chief Whip&apos;s  note       on Parliamentary Business for  the coming  Session       (CP. 27S (28)).                                      (Signed)  T. JONES,                                  Deputy Secretary  to the cabinet whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1,  September 27th, 1928.
          It is &apos;assumed that normal procedure is followedto Easter:  that Parliament resumes on April 9th and devotesits whole time thereafter to finance *1.        To take the normal 20 allotted days for Supplyplus a Finance Bill (reducedto its shortest terms) would carry the Session into June, or end of May if no whitsun recess .          To end the Session by middle of May, i.e, beforeWhitsun, it is necessary either (a) to reduce allotted days to 10, or (b) to leave Supply          J.-.uncompleted.          The reduction of the allotted days to 10 saves 9Parliamentary days (10 minus 1 for discussion).   It wouldnot be necessary for the Government to announce its&apos;intentions much in advance since all that is needed is a newSessional Order.          There is no precedent for reducing allotted daysexcept, during War years:  the necessity has not arisen.2.        The alternative course of leaving Supplyuncompleted raises from the point of view of the Treasuryseveral difficulties.          Supply will have to be completed in the new parliament.          ijhls does not save an Appropriation Bill in theold Parliament:  any Supply which has been taken must boappropriated before the Session ends          Votes on Account will be necessary in the oldParliament for the Navy, Army, Air Force,  which includings  (Parliament votes money in March for particular Navy,  Army, Air Force Votes  and Treasury powers  of viremcnt  enable these moneys to bo used for any Army, Navy  or  Air Force expenditure&apos;until supply is completed.   But  these Treasury powers  end with the Session.)                          -1-
report might in the event of obstruction take six days.          As regards Civil Votes, it is assumed that a vote on Account for the normal period of 4-g- to 5 months will have been taken in March.   A second Civil Vote onAccount (another possible two days) will be necessaryIn the old Parliament unless it can be guaranteed thatthe new Parliament will complete financial business bythe middle of August.   In view of the other businessfalling on a new Parliament (swearing of members,Address, etc .) this may be difficult.   On the otherhand a second Vote on Account providing for a long period is open to Parliamentary cSiHiolsm.   Lord John Russellin June 1841 asked for supply till 1st October.   He was forced to give a pledge that the new Par! parliament would be summoned as soon as possible.   Mr. Gladstone in June1885 as-ked for supply till 31st  October and gave asimilar pledge.   In 1095 a Vote on Account for ono monthwas taken immediately before the dissolution of Parl parliament          Thus the non-completion of Supply may (a) wastea good deal of time If there is obstruction of thoadditional Votes on Account necessary, and (b) necessitate a very early meeting of the new Parliament.
     I consider that our policy must be      (a.) To adhere rigidly to the Balfour Note principle.     (b.) To be critical of all  schemes of  revision unless  they ensure the           complete fulfilment  of that principle.     (c.) To make all concessions on our part either to our. ex-Allies or to           Germany  dependent on equivalent concessions by  the  United           States to us in respect of our debt.     As there is no likelihood whatever of this last condition being fulfilledpending the American elections, or for a year at least after those elections,it seems to me that any financial negotiations at the present time  are likelyto be both futile and dangerous.     In  view of  the  agreement reached at Geneva, we shall  have to berepresented at the meeting  of Experts; but I  consider  that we should postpone this  meeting  as long as possible, and when it  is held give our representatives definite instructions on the above lines.     There is one further point.  It  appears that the Agent-General for reparation Payments has  throughout maintained that the United  StatesGovernment will in no circumstances  link up the question of  Debts withReparations.  But he has encouraged the hope that, if  a final settlement of reparations were reached  between the Allied Governments and Germany,:the moral effect would be such  that the United States would subsequentlyprove more accommodating in regard to European debts.  I believe that anysuch hope is an absolute delusion, and I am not prepared to embark on any negotiations on such a basis.  It is quite probable that America will for along time refuse to link Debts and Reparations formally together;  but, if so, our arrangements must be so framed that the two are linked  in fact.                                                          W.  S.  C.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1,    September 28, 1928.
