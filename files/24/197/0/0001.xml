TEE DEBT ON THE TOIEIjg.LOYI.ENT FUND, &apos;                 Memorandum by the President of the. Board.                  The Minister of labour&apos;s Paper on the Debt on the          Unemployment Fund (CP. 244(28)) prompts me to raise a          question which has been in my mind for some time, at the          risk of making suggestions which may appear impracticable.                  The bulk unemployment figures with which we are          familiar do not, of course, show the real state of          industry.   If coal mining be separated out from these bulk          figures we find that while at the end of June 1924, there          were in round numbers 984,000 persons unemployed in          industries other than coal mining and at the same date in          1925 1,026,000,  there were at the end of June, 1927, only          805,000 and even at  the end of last  month,  in spite of          slack trade,  there were no more than 925^000.  As near as          I can make out in the three years 1924-27 the number of          insured persons  employed in industries other than coal          mining  and contributing to the Unemployment Insurance Fund          must have  increased  by something like 600,000 and there          has  probably  not been a net decrease  since  then.   It is,          I presume,  fairly certain that,  excluding the mining          industry, we  shall succeed before very long in returning          to and  passing the low record level  of unemployment which          we reached last  year.                  It  is obviously absurd to burden a  Fund which would          otherwise  be  in  the  comparatively prosperous position          indicated  by  these figures, with the  dead weight  of 300,000          miners  who  we not only know will not  be re-absorbed into
 their industry but  whose re-absorption we positively wish  to  prevent in  the  economic  interests of the industry itself.  As  I  undeistand it,  the Unemployment Insurance Act  aims  at getting rid of this burden  by throwing out of insurance all men who  must be regarded as permanently unemployed.   This  is, no doubt,  a  sound principle, but I have never been  able  to  understand how this  proposal  is expected actually to  work in the mining areas.   There  are 300,000 miners  out of work to-day; there were 314,000  at this  time three  years  ago;  and there were 233,000  last year.   While  these  are,  of course,  not all the same  men,  yet  I suppose  that when the Unemployment Insurance  Act comes into  full force next year something like  a  quarter of  a million miners will lose their right to  unemployment  benefit  either immediately or within a few months.  Is this  a prospect which we  can face,  or which we can expect  the public to face,  at the time of a General Election?    If not - If I have misunderstood the probable operation of theUnemployment Insurance Act  or  if we are driven to amend that Act  - then the industry of the country  as a whole will continue  to have to  bear  the burden  of the surplus labour discarded by the mining industry and  the only alternatives to the growing insolvency of  the Unemploy- ment  Insurance  Fund will  &quot;be those suggested, by the Minister of Labour, viz.  a higher level of contributions or a  lower level of benefits.  How can we  possibly justify  to the  industries of the  country  as  a whole such revolutionary  treatment of a Fund which would  be in a relatively healthy condition if it had not to  bear the burden thrown on it by  the mining  industry?
         I feel we  ought, at any rate, to consider anotherpossible alternative7 namely, that  of temporarily takingthe coal mining indust.ry out of the Unemployment insurance fund altogether,   I have not^ of courset the necessaryknowledge to put forward a concrete proposal with any certainty,, but I suggest the following plan simply in orderto provoke discussions       - The Unemployment Insurance Act should be amended soas to give the Minister of Labour power to take temporarilyout of the Insurance Pond any industry where there is anabnormal percentage of permanent unemployment and which isincapable of reabsorbing any considerable number of theseunemployed.  A separate fund should be established for suchan industry, financed by the statutory contributions fromemployersj workers, and the State, plus a contribution fromthe general Unemployment Insurance Fund calculated on theassumption that the percentage of unemployment in theseparated industry is equal to the average percentage rateof all the industries contributing to that Fund.   If aseparate coal mining insurance fund, constituted on this basis, were to continue to pay out the existing statutorybenefits to unemployed miners, I should presume, at a rough gues33 that  it would have to face a deficit of atleast  5,000,000 a year.  I suggest, however, that theseparated, fund for the coal mining industry should not be bound to pay out the existing statutory benefits.  If theAct were left to operate as It stands, a very largeproportion of the unemployed miners would forfeit all rightto benefit and would be thrown upon the poor rate, and itshould, therefore,, be the fanetion of the separated fund to administer a system of poor relief rather than a systemof Insursnce.  The scheme would9 in fa,ct, amount to the                          3o
       assumption by the central government of responsibility,       not Indeed for the able &quot;bodied unemployed of particular       areas., as foolishly suggested by our opponents, but for       the unemployed of a particular industry in process of       fundamental reorganisation^  Even so, the deficit would be       large.  When conditions in the mining industry become       settled, the separated fund would.be liquidated; and the       industry\ retransferred to the main Fund,  and no doubt the       State  would then have to pay  off the greater&quot;     part, if       not the. whole, of the deficit-.                  I need hardly say  that I fully realise the       objections to- this proposal,  financial and other, but I       would  urge, the following considerations in its favour.  It       is infinitely preferable to Increasing the contributions       or lowering the benefits of unemployment Insurance as a       whole.  It is preferable also to the quite impracticable       course of throwing the&apos;whole  of this indigestible lump       of unemployment on to the.Poor lew Guardians.   It would,       I assume, restore the Unemployment Insurance Fund to a       condition of solvency.  It would, finally, greatly increase       our power of bringing pressure to bear upon the population       in the mining areas to seek work elsewhere by making       that  population dependent upon a fund directly administered       by the Minister of Labour with the widest discretion as       to the distribution of relief,                                              EoP.Board of Education,  20th July,  1928.
