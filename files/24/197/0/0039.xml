[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.1               Printed  far the Cabinet.  October 1928.CONFIDENTIAL.O.P.  290 (28).DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATION OF THE DOMINIONS.     MEMORANDUM BY THE ACTING SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS.      THE  question raised by the  Secretary of State  for  the Dominions in his memorandum on the appointment  of  Canadian and  Irish  Free State diplomatic representatives in Paris is one of the first importance in regard to the constitutional structure of  the British Empire as a whole,  and it is  therefore one that ought not to be hastily decided or without consultation with the other  Dominions  and the Government of India.      i can find no justification for the contention of the Canadian Government that the form used in Mr. ChiltoiTs note to Washington of the 19th November,  1926,  is in any way inconsistent with the conclusions of  the last Imperial Conference.      The position in regard to the diplomatic representation of the British Empire abroad resulting from the settlement at the last Imperial Conference, and the notes regarding  the  appointment  of  Irish  Free  State  and  Canadian  Ministers  in Washington, is that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador or Minister is charged with the duty of representing to  the  foreign Government  to which  he is accredited  matters  of Imperial concern or matters which concern other  Dominions.  While neither Great Britain nor the Dominions could be committed to the acceptance of active obligations except with the consent of their own Governments,  the conference did  not regard this  &quot; governing consideration&quot;  as  incompatible with a  recognition that in the general conduct of foreign policy  as in matters of defence,  the major share of responsibility rests now, and must for some time continue to rest, with His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain.  So  long as that position is intact the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs remains the channel, and, as is clearly shown by the notes to the United States Government, the sole channel, by which the will of  the several Governments of the Empire should  be co-ordinated in the  instructions sent to His Majesty&apos;s representatives abroad in matters of Imperial concern.  But the Secretary of State, of course, acts in accordance with the new system of communication and consultation to which special attention was given at the last  Imperial Conference.     The interests involved are not confined to^ those of the two Dominions which have raised it.  It is a matter which it may not be possible to settle except at the next Imperial  Conference, and which cannot, I submit, in any case be settled in any sub- stantially new way without consultation with all the  Dominions.   If His Majesty&apos;s- Government in Great Britain  were satisfied with  any new formula suggested, they could not, if it departed from the old one in any  material manner, answer for any other self-governing part of the British Empire.  Australia and New Zealand are as much concerned as the rest of the Empire, and have both shown in the past that they have  views which cannot be disregarded.    When the arrangements for an  Irish  Free State  Minister at Washington  were under discussion early in 1921, the Commonwealth Government expressed the  view that the new appointment might lead to consequences having a serious effect on the principle of the diplomatic unity of the Empire and deserved fuller discussion before effect was given to the proposal; they suggested that, as no urgency was apparent, the matter might await the next Imperial Conference.  The  Prime Minister of New Zealand recorded the view that it  was &quot; essential that  all territories of  the  Crown should be united in their relations to foreign Powers,&quot;  and the belief that  &quot;union can only be maintained by a  single representative of the Crown in every foreign capital. &quot;*   * The formulas adopted in the case of the Canadian and Irish Free State Ministers at Washington were settled without reference to any Dominion other than Canada and the Irish Free State respectively, but allother Dominions were, informed of their adoption, and in the  absence of comment on the part of anyDominion, it may be assumed that the adoption  of the existing formulae would be generally acceptable.      4611   [18242]
     It must also be remembered that whatever concession is made to the Dominions in this respect now might be claimed in the future for India!     In the notifications to the French Government in regard to the Canadian and Free State  Ministers, it is not enough to describe  their functions  only;  it is also necessary to define, without unduly circumscribing them, the Imperial  functions which His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Paris will in future carry out.  His position must not be reduced to that of an Envoy from His Majesty for  Great Britain only;  or even for Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand and those parts of the British Empire which are not separate Members of the League of Nations.  He must, in the opinion of the Foreign Office, remain the  King&apos;s Imperial Representative,  who acts as the mouthpiece of all His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the case  of all representations on the greater political  issues  which affect the welfare of the Empire as a whole, without the necessity of taking with him to the French. Minister for Foreign Affairs, on  every such occasion, a number of Dominion representatives, who will certainly number two and might possibly be five.     The crux of the matter is the method of handling, vis-a-vis foreign Governments, matters  which affect more  than one  part  of  the  Empire.  The Irish Free  State and Canadian Governments wish to  have  joint or concurrent action on the part of His  Majesty&apos;s Ambassador and the Dominions  Minister,  instead of the latter, after any  necessary  preliminary  consultation, remaining  in the  background and leaving the Ambassador as the spokesman.  We might admit in theory that a matter of purely Canadian and Free  State  concern should be  dealt with by the two; butthere is  the danger that this would involve, or lead to, jointly signed, concurrent, or,  worse still,  divergent, notes, which would certainly lead to the  gravest possible inconvenience  and  confusion.   It  would form   an  irresistible  precedent for simultaneous action by all the representatives when a  matter affecting all  was in question.   The  French Government would  have to  deal  with  three  or  more representatives, speaking,  sooner or later,  with varying voices on a matter which should  have been  settled  as between the parts  of  the  Empire  involved beforeanything was  said to  the  French  Government.   Moreover, the  opportunity so afforded for exhibiting to foreigners open dissension in the Empire, and for working towards the dissolution  of Imperial unity, is obvious. It is hardly more necessary to point out the perplexity which the French  Government  would feel  in dealing with several  spokesmen  instead of one.   The system would,  without any doubt, lead to grave practical difficulties.     In  the view of the  Foreign Office, therefore, a case  concerning any part of the Empire besides the individually represented Dominion should be dealt  with by His Majesty&apos;s  Ambassador, with  as  much  preliminary  consultation  with  Dominion representatives as may be necessary.     It is true that an apparent departure from  this principle (the departure to which both Canadian and Irish Free State Governements drawr  attention) was made in connexion with the Treaty for the Renunciation of War as an instrument of national policy.   In this case,  after the preliminary discussions had been conducted through the United States  Ambassador in London  and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,  invitations to join in the  treaty were  sent  to the Canadian and Irish Free State Governments, not  through the Foreign Office or through their own Ministers in Washington, but through the United States Ministers in Ottawa and Dublin.  Though it would probably  have been better to avoid this in order to carry out in full the principle set up  when  Ministers were appointed at Washington,  it can hardly be said to constitute a serious  departure from the arrangements made at that  time; and it is a departure which we should not allow, if we can avoid  it, to grow into established practice.     The Secretary of State for the Dominions attaches more importance than  I can do  to  a written  assertion that diplomatic  unity  is to be  maintained.   Such an assertion, if Mr.  Amery&apos;s proposal be carried out, would be simply untrue.  Indeed, it is untrue already; for diplomatic unity does  not consist in agreement which may or may not be continuously secured between various authorities, but in utilizing  a single channel of  communication with  Foreign Governments.   We have already gravely  compromised diplomatic unity, and I  agree that it is now, as Mr.  Amery forcibly points out, extremely difficult to devise a logical limitation to the  extension of disintegration.  But. we should surely do our best to discourage and  delay it?  I submit  that before any further step  is sanctioned,  the whole problem, with&apos; all its implications and dangers, should be frankly laid before  an Imperial Conference.     For the practical dangers of diplomatic disunity are very real.   Not much harm can  be  done by Dominion  Statesmen separately  signing a  Peace Pact, or making
speeches at Geneva;  but it would be not a; little embarrassing&apos; if their accreditedrepresentatives at foreign capitals were to  put forward officially views on mattersof international law, such as the extent of territorial waters or belligerent rights, at variance with those maintained by the Imperial  Government.  Yet this would be within their rights if they are not to be restricted to matters exclusively  relatingto their own Dominion.  To believe that none of them will ever do so appears to mea facile optimism, hazardous to rely upon.  Even  if we assume the existence in allthe Dominions, both now and in the future, of the strictest loyalty to the unity ofthe Empire, can anything be more certain than that sooner or later divergent viewswill be expressed on questions of common concern, if more than one voice is raisedwhen such questions are under discussion with a foreign Government ?     The results may at any moment be gravely prejudicial to the general interests ofthe Empire : (an easy example is the discussion with the German Government for extending  the operation of the Reparation Recovery Act so as to make  it coverGerman exports to the Dominions as well as those to the United Kingdom).     If,  therefore, the  wording of the notes to the United States Government is tobe abandoned,  I  suggest  that their  substance at  least should be  preserved.  Thefollowing formula is submitted by the Foreign Office as possibly more acceptable tothe Canadian and Irish Free State Governments, though it is recognised and intended that in substance it does not differ from the old one :          &quot; Such a Minister would be accredited by His  Majesty  the King to the     President of the French Republic and  he  would be furnished with credentials     which would enable him to take charge of all affairs  relating to Canada.  He     would be the ordinary channel of communication with the French  Government     on  these matters.  Matters  which concern more than one of His  Majesty&apos;s     Governments or the whole of the British  Empire will continue to  be  handled     by His Majesty&apos;s Embassy as heretofore, as also matters of concern only to His     Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain or a part  of the Empire which has not     individual diplomatic representation  in  Paris.   It  is not  intended that the     arrangements proposed should derogate from the  principle of the diplomatic     unity of the Empire,  The Canadian Minister would be at  all times in the closest     touch with His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,  and any question  which may arise as to     whether a matter comes within the category of those to be handled -by the     Canadian Minister or not would be settled by  consultation between them.&quot;                                                                           C.Foreign Office, October 8, 1928.
