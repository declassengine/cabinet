The  King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament.                               August; 3, 1928.My Lords and  Members of the House  of Commons,    THE visit of Their Majesties the King and Queen of Afghanistan in march last was an auspicious event in the history of Our two countries.  To Me it will always be a pleasant memory, and I have received with much gratification messages.from  King Amanulla expressing His  warm appreciation of the welcome  accorded to Their Majesties.  It is a matter of national congratulation that the visit has.confirmed and strengthened the good relations existing between Afghanistan andthe British Empire.    My  Government  have  been happy to  accept the  proposed  treaty  for the,renunciation  of  war in the foi*m  in  which  it was  finally proposed to them bythe Government of the United States.  The  proposed treaty has similarly beenaccepted by My  Governments in the Dominions  and by the Government of India.It is  My confident expectation that, when completed,  it will constitute a new and important guarantee of  the world&apos;s peace.    Negotiations between My Government and  the  French, Italian and Spanish,Governments for the  revision  of the Tangier Statute have just  reached a.successful  conclusion.   Under  the terms  of  the  instrument  embodying theresults  of these negotiations, which  I have  caused to be laid before you, Italybecomes a contracting party  to the  Statute  and Spain  receives  additionalguarantees for the security of her zone.    A treaty between  Myself  and His Imperial Majesty the  Shah  of  Persia,regulating the commercial relations between Our countries, and providing for the abrogation of existing treaty provisions which limit  the right  of Persia to settleher customs tariff autonomously, has been signed by Our respective representatives.They  have also recorded agreements on other  important questions in subsidiarynotes.  The texts of these documents  will be laid before you in due course.    In  harmony with  the  Resolution  of  the Imperial Conference  of  1926,recommending the  further development of  the  present system, of  consultation between My Governments, arrangements have been completed for the appoint-ment  by My Government in Great Britain  of a representative in Canada, withthe title of High Commissioner.  He will proceed to Ottawa in September.    The Imperial Wireless  and  Cables Conference  has submitted a unanimousreport on the improvement  of  telegraphic communications  between the  severalparts  of My Empire.   To the principles underlying  the report the Governmentsconcerned are favourably disposed.  I  hope that  with whole-hearted co-operation the telegraph  systems which unite  its various  parts  will  be organised to thelasting  benefit of My Empire.    The Order  in Council under  the British  Guiana Act, 1928, enabling Me tocreate a new Constitution for that Colony,  has been passed. &apos;!   The Commission appointed to examine the  Constitution of  Ceylon has now presented its  report,  and  its  recommendations will  receive  the careful con-sideration of  My Ministers.    The  Commissioners  appointed  to enquire into  agriculture  and ruraleconomy in British India have  submitted a unanimous report, containing many-recommendations for  the  promotion of the  welfare  of  the rural population.   Iam confident that these recommendations will  receive  sympathetic and fruitfulconsideration from the competent authorities    1S014
MY LORDS AND  MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS,    The condition  of  our basic industries  and the high level of  unemploymentcontinue  to  cause Me anxiety.    My  Ministers  have prepared  a  scheme  for relieving agriculture  and other productive industries  from the onerous burdenof rates.   The  relief  will affect not only the direct burden of rates but also the indirect  burden  thrown  specially  upon the  basic industries by the presentsystem of rating railways, docks and canals.  This policy involves  as  a. necessaryconsequence the enactment of long-desired reforms in local government and inthe financial  relations between the State  and  local authorities.   My  ministers are hopeful that in respect of selected industrial and agricultural traffic the reliefmay come into  force at the  end  of  the present  year.   I  trust  that   thesecomprehensive proposals will not only  increase employment generally,  but willalso  bring  special relief to the  areas which are most  in need of  it.    I have given My assent  to a measure assimilating the Local Government and parliamentary Franchise of  men and women.   This will  confer  equal  electoralrights on the two  sexes.    A Bill  has   been  passed, based generally  on  the recommendations of MyCommission  on  National Health  Insurance, whereby the existing  system will be materially  simplified  and improved.    Steady progress has been  made  during  the  year in the provision of housingfor the people,  and  the price  of  house construction has continued  generally to fall.    I  have  given My assent to  a  measure for assisting  the credit of persons engaged in agriculture in England and Wales, and  My Government have prepared a scheme for effecting the same object  in  Scotland.    A Bill   has been passed  to  provide  for  the  grading  and  marking  ofagricultural produce.    It is a source  of  special satisfaction to Me that it has been found  possible,subject to  suitable  safeguards, to  secure permanently the  present   rates  ofdisability pension  for the Great War against any  reduction  owing to a fall inthe cost of  living.   This will remove an element  of uncertainty which disturbsthe minds of those who are,  unhappily, still suffering from the effects of  their war service.    The rapid growth of road  traffic has  created new problems  which demandinvestigation.   I have appointed a Commission  which will,  I hope,  result  in measures for the wise development of all available means of transport.    Bills  have  also  been passed to reorganise  certain Scottish  Departments,and  for  setting up  a Commission to  deal with educational endowments  inScotland.           ...    It is  My earnest  prayer that the blessing  of  Almighty God may rest  upon all your past and coming labours.MEMBERS OP THE  HOUSE OF COMMONS,    I thank yon for the provision you have made for  the  public service.
