In May 192 7 a Committee of tho cabinet approved? a proposal to introduce legislation increasing            by two  the numbers of the members of the Judicial            Committee  by the appointment  of two people of Indian            experience,  thus affirming the principle embodied in the            Judicial Committee Bill of 1926.    The Committee at the.P.154(27)   same  time, after considering  a memorandum3&quot; prepared by            !orC  Haldanw,  decided that no case had at that date            been  made  out  for increasing  the  number of Lords of            Appeal  in  Ordinary.   (cabinet 32(27)  Conclusion l).            2.      The  proposal  for enlarging the numbers of the            Judicial Committee was again  affirmed by the  Cabinet -            this  year  (Cabinet 16(28)10), was embodied in the            Administration of Justice Bill, and passed the House of            Lords,  but It  had to  be omitted from the Bill in the            House of Commons through lack of  time.  This  px*proposal has,            therefore,  on  three occasions been befegre Parliament            and passed the House  of Lords,  and it  has three  times            failed  to  become law  through  lack of  time and through            the opposition of a small minority in the Commons.            It Is no less  important now than  it was  in 1926.            On the  contrary,  the  fact that  the Indian Assembly            in that year passed a Resolution  in favour of defraying            from  Indian  funds half the  salary  of  each of  the  two            members to be  appointed makes it  especially Important            that  the necessary legislation  should  be  enacted  without            further delay  in this  Parliament.   Since  1926 the work                                     1.
 of  the Julieial Committee has increased.,  especially in Indian appeals,  and  it  is impossible to  carry on the work of that  Committee  with  reasonable  efficiency unless the  proposal  is  again submitted  to  Parliament and carried into law during  next Session.    As  the matter has been three  times before my colleagues and on  each  occasion received their approval,  it  appears  unnecessary  to argue the  question  further-   I  only desire to register emphatically  my  view -  which I have  reason  to suppose is also  that  of  the Secretary of State for  India that It  is imperative that action should,  be taken in this matter before the  C-eneral Election.     3c    The  case with  regard  to  the other  proposal,  that is?  the  provision of additional  lords of  Appeal  in Ordinary, does not, however,  stand as it  did  in  19E7. lord Gaves In considering the  situation as  it thon stood, reckoned  that there would  be  available for  thework of  the House of Lords and the two Divisions  of  the Judicial Committee, when the  Judicial Committee  Bill had passed,  no less  than nineteen  peers  or Privy  Councillorswhose attendance might be expected with reasonable regularity when  it was required.    4*  . These nineteen were -         The  Lord. Chancellor         6 Lords of Appeal In  Ordinary         2 new Indian, members  of  the Judicial              Committee         3 ex-Lord Chancellors (Lords Haldane,              Bue master s and Finlay.)         4 volunteers peers  (Lords V/renburyv              Phlliimore, Darling, and Warrington)-         3 Privy Councillors  fiord Sinaa, Lord              Salve sen,, Sir Lancelot  Sanderson)o
 5.     He reckoned that  there were  other  qualified persons to whom recourse could he had  in  emergency.,6..    As the., utmost- number required to man the two Tribunals at full strength is fifteen, this appeared to the Lord Chancellor to give sufficient margin, and, if matters still stood now as they  stood  then, I should not now ask my colleagues to reconsider the matter. Very serious alterations in the situation have, however, occurred. 7.     The Lord Chancellor and the  six Lords of Appeal in Ordinary of course remain as before, and if (but only if) effect is given to the earlier  paragraphs of thisMemorandum, there will be in addition two Indian membersof the Privy Council - a total paid strength of ninemembers, though it should be noted  that two of them will be available only for the Judicial Committee.8.      But old age., illness and death have most seriouslythinned tht; ranks of the ten unpaid qualified persons on whom Lord Cave relied.   Lords Ealdane and Sinha aredead; Lord Pinlay, who is 86, has suffered a severeillness and It is improbable that he will ever again sit on either of these Trihunals;  Lord Buckmaster also hasbeen seriously ill,  and though it may bo hoped that fromtime to time he will be  ahle to assist,  he must he written off as a regular attendant;   Lord Wrenbury is nearly 83 and almost totally blind, and thus the number of regularvolunteers has been reduced in twelve months from tento five.9.      But this is not the full discount to which lord Cave&apos;s figures must be subjected.   Lord Phillimoro
 Is  also  nearly  83.   It  is  obvious that he cannot  long be  expected to  serve and he has many outside engagements which  occupy his time,  and is entitled by his many years of  service to such leisure as he desires.   It will be remembered that Lord Darling never sat in the Court of Appeal and, by  reason of this fact and of the nature of his experience both  on the Bench and at the Bar, cannot reasonably be ashed to sit in a large proportion of the oases which occupy the time of either Tribunal. Lord Salvesen and Sir Lancelot Sanderson are not qualified to sit in the House of Lords, and it is highly probable that, when the Judicial Committee Bill Is passed, Sir Lancelot Sanderson (if not appointed to one of the twopositions created by it) will cease to attend.  Thus LordWarrington Is left as the only completely effective judicial person in addition to the nine paid members available for the work of both Tribunals, and he, beingunder no obligation,  moral or legal,  to sit, desiresduring certain periods of the year to be away from London- 10.    During the greater part of last term the full number of persons available was absorbed as  follows:-       (a) The Lord Chancellor,  with  three Lords           of Appeal in Ordinary (Lords Dunedin,           Sumner, and Atkin) sat to hear Dominion           Appeals at the Judicial Committee, the           number of the Court being  brought up to           five by the attendance of  the Chief Justice           of Canada.       (b) Three other Lords of Appeal In Ordinary           (Lords Shaw,  Carson,  and Blanesburgh),           with Sir John Wallls and Sir Lancelot           Sanderson, were engageC to hear a very           long Indian Appeal. 11.     As Lord Warrington was in the country and LordDarling was engaged on the Co&amp;mittee  considering theRailway Bills, Lord Phillimore was the only other g person qualified to sit on either Tribunal and it was,  therefore,                        4.
 impossible-  to continue  the  Sittings  of the House  of lords for judicial business between  the  30th  June and the end  of  July, although, nine cases - some of them of great importance - were in  the list  for  trial. 12o      There will be no improvement when the Legal Term begins in October,   5  Dominion, 5 Grown Colony and 33 Indian cases stood for  trial at the  end  of July, all of which ought to be tried in  the autumn; and prob3.&apos;bly others have matured since.  The Chief Justice of Canada has returned to that country and Lord Y/arrington  is available to take his place;  Lord Phillimore  if he is willing to sit and Lord Salvesen will  probably be available, but this only makes twelve persons for the three CoxurtSo  But it is impossible longer to suspend the Sittings of the House of Lords, and I have i therefore. been obliged to instruct the Registrar of the Judicial Committee  that there can be no sitting for the purpose of  taking Dominion appeals until further notice.  The result  is obvious and seems to require no comment, 13o      It is, therefore, apparent that  the House of Lords and the two Divisions of the Judicial Committee cannot,while the judicial strength remains  at its present numbers, continue to sit simultaneously.  One Tribunal or the othermust suspend its operations in order to enable the otherto continue at proper strength.  The result is either tc inflict irl&apos;..;b amounts to. a denial of  justice upon english and Scottish litigants,  or gravely to reduce the importance and prestige of the Judicial Committee in the  eyes ofthe Dominions,  and to cause a very serious and increasingdelay in the hearing of appeals from Overseas.14c     I have considered anxiously whether in thesecircumstances I ought not to ask my colleagues to
 authorise  the  introduction  of  legislation  increasing the  number of  Lords  of  Appeal  in  Ordinary  by  two. I fully  realise  the  difficulties  - Parliamentary and otherwise  - which  are involved in such  a proposal, but, as  I have  already  stated, unless  some addition  is made, the two.  Tribunals  cannot continue  to  do  their  work  efficiently and  can  hardly continue  to  do  their  work at all.  I have, however, coma  to the conclusion that an addition-of one at the  present moment would remove some of our pz^esent difficulties,  and  I  now  limit  my  proposal  to the addition of one,  partly from  a desire to impose as  small a financial charge as  possible, and partly because any large addition to the permanent numbers of the Tribunal must necessarily involve  the danger of reducing its quality.  I should propose  that the additional member to he appointed when Parliament has given its authority should be taken from the equity Bench,  so that the Lords of Appeal  in Ordinarywould then be  constituted, as to two, from Scotland,  as to three, from among the English Common lawyers,  andv  as t&apos;o two, from among the English Ghancery lawyers.   Theunexpected loss of Lord Haldane and Lord Buckmaster and the inability  of Lord Wrenbury to sit makes the Court dangerously weak on its equity side. 15.      I propose that the form the legislation should takeshould be the conferment upon the appropriate  authority of the power to appoint  an additional lord  of  Appeal  in Ordinary and to fill up  any vacancy,  and not an imperativerequirement that there should at all  times  be  sevenLaw Lords.    The result  would bo that if hereafter  thesituation alters, as it  might do,  for example, If severalex-Lord Chancellors were once again alive and  available,
       it would &quot;be possible to leave any vacancy in excess of six       unfilled.-.       16.     It will be noticed that, even if this addition Is       made, there will still be available only ten salaried       members under a continuous duty to serve-   The situation       will thus still remain anxious *  I should hope, however,       that by obtaining the assistance of Lord Warrington and       occasionally of Lord Phillimore, and of Chief Justice       Anglin or some other Canadian Judge during the Summer, with       occasional aid from among the others qualified to sit,       and by adopting more frequently the practice of composing       a Court of three members only, we may be able to carry       on the work.  Unless the additions, here proposed, both       to the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary and to the Judicial       Committee are made, it is totally impossible to do so.       17.      The cost of the additions proposed to be male       to the Judicial Committee will be  4000 a year -  4000 in    ,   addition being found by India.  The cost of the proposal       to add a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary is  5000 per annum,       being the salary attached to that office -  This latter       proposal involves no additional charge r.pon Parliamentary       time as the legislative provision required can be included       in the Judicial Committee Bill and only one financial       Resolution Y*rill be needed to cover both proposals..                                       (Intd)  H.House of Lords,         4th October, 1928
