DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.                                                             28                                                  Copy No_                           CABINET.           CONVENTION FOR THE ABOLITION OP  IMPORT AND EXPORT                    PROHIBITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS.           Memorandum by the president of the Board of Trade.     An International Conference was held at Geneva in July lastto consider inter alia - the conditions under which the Conventiondrawn up at a previous conference  held last year for theabolition of Import and Export  Prohibitions and Restrictions shouldbe brought info force.   We have now to consider whether steps should be taken to ratify this  convention.   No question oflegislation is involved.     It is not necessary to consider the provisions of theConvention, in any great detail.  It is sufficient to  say that whilstrecognising that there are certain classes  of prohibitions andrestrictions which may properly be maintained or imposed,  (e.g.those relating to public security or public health  or thoseregarding traffic in arms)  it definitely secures that prohibitionsshall not be imposed by any of  the Contracting Parties which donot fall within one or other of these defined categories.Exceptionallyj certain countries are allowed to maintain specified Iexisting prohibitions which do  not so fall,  and in  particularour right to maintain the  existing restriction on the importation   Iof dyestuffs is thus recognised.   The acceptance of the  Convention - 1by us would involve no change in the existing practice  of theBritish Government with regard  to  the imposition oi prohibitionsor restrictions;   and in fact it would impose  on us noobligations other or more  onerous  than those already  assumed  by                               -1-jjRBT.p. 296 (28).
9 99AJI M Wus under the Anglo-German Treaty.     The Conference which was  held in July determined that theConvention should come into force on January 1st 19 30, but only if it were ratified by 18 countries, which might however, hereduced to 1? should the United States fail to ratify.  power was given to any country to make its ratification conditional onthe accession or ratification of any or all of the countries in a specified list.  In the event of such a condition not beingfulfilled, the ratification of the country concerned would not,of course, he effective, and  it would not count towards thenumber of 18 ratifications required.     In my opinion, it is desirable that steps should he taken at an early date for the ratification of the Convention on behalfof the United Kingdom, and that without attaching any oondition toour ratification.  My reasons for this conclusion are as follows.     As already stated, the acceptance of the Convention by H.M.Government would impose no obligations other or more onerousthan those which they have already assumed under the Anglo-German&apos;Commercial Treaty, which also limited the right  of the two Partiesto impose prohibitions and restrictions.  But, if it came intoforce, it would have the effect of imposing the  same obligationson 16 or 1? other countries;   and we,  as a great exporting country,have much to gain from the acceptance by other countries of these obligations.  Nothing is more hampering to our exports, and moredetested by our exporters than any form of prohibition or restriction on the admission of their goods in overseas markets.The necessarily arbitrary nature of a licensing systemassociated with prohibitions on imports,  and the opportunity forhidden discrimination, mean that trade is subjected to themaximum of uncertainty and that all confidence is destroyed.     We therefore stand to gain largely from the coming into  force othe Convention;  and to my mind there is no doubt that  byratifying as soon as possible and without conditions,  we should
Q *JIw 5 help materially  in  getting it brought into force.  We should be  setting  an  example which other States would be likely to fellew.  If we do not give this  early lead* certain other countries,  through  excess of caution, may ratify only on conditions  which are ultimately  found to be -unfulfilled and therefore to render their ratifications nugatory.  Moreover, the longer  ratifications are withheld,the more likely are some countries,  which would ratify now if they were given an unhesitating lead, not to ratify at all.     Further,  there is a general consideration, connected with our position in  the League, to which I venture to think weight should he attached.  In so many cases, in League matters taken as a  whole, political and  economic, we have to hang back or  put on the  brake.  When, therefore, we can lead without running any risk there is a great deal to be said for seizing the opportunity.  And in this case there is no difficulty.  We have as a government expressed our approval of the principles, as  we read  them, which underlay the Resolutions  of the World Economic Conference of 1927;    and there can be no doubt, I should say, that  we should do well to he, if possible, first in  the field and to give tangible evidence of our approval by  an early adherence to the first  International Convention framed to give effect to certain of those principles,  and particularly as their adoption happens to he wholly in our interests.     There is only one argument  that  occurs to me on the other side.  This should be mentioned,  though it  is  based on a conceivable combination of circumstances which is very unlikelyand appears to  be relatively  unimportant even  if that  combination
should take place.  Germany and Poland  have for a long time been trying to make a commercial  treaty but so far they have failed and are maintaining prohibitions  against each other.If they continue to fail and Poland does not ratify theConvention, Germany may be unwilling to do so.  This would not much matter to us so long as the Anglo--German Treaty remained in force as it contains a clause relating to prohibitions.But Germany by denouncing this Treaty could bring- it to anend by September 1930 or at any time thereafter.  In this event Germany, if she did not ratify the convention couldimpose prohibitions.  But we, if we had ratified theConvention and it became effective, would be bound until 1936,the earliest date at which we could withdraw from theConvention, to enforce no new prohibitions against any of the signatories or against any country entitled in the UnitedKingdom to most-favoured-nation treatment in this matter by Treaty.  Consequently we could only enforce prohibitionsagainst Germany if we should ever desire to do so,by discriminating against her, which would certainly resultin counter-discrimination and probably in a tariff war.It might be said, therefore, that we  should either makeGermany&apos;^ ratification a condition of our ratifying orwait  till Germany has ratified.  Further, it might be saidthat as France may hold back, and Italy also if Germany doesnot ratify, we should refuse to be bound-unless they also are bound.     I must confess that this argument does not appeal to me.If countries are encouraged to ratify only on conditions,the coming into force of the Convention may be indefinitelydelayed;   and nothing would do more to induce Germany tomake a  serious effort to come to terms with Poland than a fewratifications without conditions,  including ours.   In view of
9 9^ W 1/the prominent part Germany has played in the negotiation ofthis Convention, she would he placed in a most invidiousposition if it came into foroe without her  adherence..  And.ifit did, she would find it very difficult to maintain anyprohibitions against the signatories, for the same reason.Moreover,whatever happened, we should in my view stand to gain,as the  adherence of at least 16 other States would be wellworth having.  Rightly I think,we did not hesitate to include a prohibitions clause in the Anglo-German Treaty, although itplaced us in an even more one-sided position, as Germanyalone was pledged to us whereas under most-favoured-nationclauses in our Treaties we became pledged to most othercountries with which we have treaty relations.  A fortiori.we ought not to hesitate in this case, because when theConvention comes into force we shall have at least 16 othercountries pledged to us.  And among these 16 there are bound tobe a number of important Countries.     I ought to add that if we should decide to ratify theConvention in question it follows that we should also ratifytwo minor Conventions relating to export prohibitions and export duties on hides and skins and bones and glue stock.These are to come into force somewhat before the maininstrument, and their enforcement indeed is needed to pave theway for the  general adoption of the  latter.  Theseinstruments substitute by agreement certain limited exportduties for prohibitions.  We are not directly concerned as wehave neither prohibitions nor export duties in connection withthese articles and there is no reason to suppose that  weshould ever desire to impose either.     I therefore recommend that we  should ratify the .mainConvention on behalf of the  United  Kingdom at  an early date,without attaching  any condition to  our  ratification, and  that
we should also ratify the  two minor Conventions  referred toin the preceding paragraph.                                P.C.-L.10th October,  1928.
