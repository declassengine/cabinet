[This  Document is the Property of His Britannic  Majesty^ Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1928.SECRET.Copy No.CP. 268 (28).CABINET.SILVER AND  CURRENCY IN THE  IRISH FREE STATE.            MEMORANDUM BY THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER.&apos; -   IN accordance with Conclusion 14 of Cabinet 42 (28), I circulate a draft of theletter which I  propose to send to Mr. Cosgrave on  the subject of the British silvercoin now circulating in the Irish Free State.    The  letter will be dispatched in this form unless during the course of the next week I receive any objections or suggestions from my colleagues.                               ^              &apos;      &quot;            w. s. c.    Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,My dear Mr. Cosgrave,    I DULY received your letter of the 9th July* in regard to the withdrawal ofthe British  silver coin now circulating in the Free State.   Though I must demurto some of your principal arguments, I much  appreciate the spirit in which, you have set out the views of your Government, and it is in no contentious spirit, but rather in the hope of clearing up misunderstandings, that I should like to develop the case as we see it.    In the first place, you refer more than once to &quot; the Australian and South Africanprecedents,&quot; and you urge that our attitude towards the withdrawal of British silverin the Free State is inconsistent with  these arrangements.   But the fact is that thearrangement with Australia was entered into at a time when the withdrawal of thesilver coin could be effected without any loss; and when the arrangement was madewith South Africa the value of silver  was 30 per cent, higher than it is to-day, andthe loss on withdrawal correspondingly less.   In both these cases,  the arrangementsmade for the gradual redemption, over a long period, of the silver in question clearlyimply a recognition, on the part of the Dominions concerned, that the British Govern-ment was under no legal obligation in the matter.  Indeed, it has, never before  beensuggested that  a Dominion Government has the right to  present, or  the BritishGovernment the obligation to accept, silver coin withdrawn from circulation withouta previous  arrangement between the  two Governments, which arrangement would naturally be framed in accordance with the circumstances, of the moment.    You argue, indeed, that we have a moral responsibility in that we obtained full value for this token coinage in the shape of  goods.   But is this argument really a.sound one 1  There was, of course, a profit when the token coinage was first  put  intocirculation, but any and all profits so realised from the coinage issued both  in GreatBritain  and in  Ireland were part  of&apos; the ordinary budget receipts used to relievetaxation.  Until the separation, these receipts  went  to the Joint Exchequer,  andinured as much to the benefit of the Irish as of the British taxpayer. This is anotherconsideration which should be borne in mind when the question arises of drawing aninference from the arrangements made with South Africa and Australia.   In neitherAugust 18, 1928.*Reproduced in CP. 264 (28).[18099]
 of these Dominions had  the taxpayer received-any benefit from the profits  of the coinage which we agreed to withdraw, and in our view this was the most important ground for the concessions made to them.  In our view, therefore, the situation in the Free State differs very materially from that in Australia or in South Africa, and your proposal involves the imposition on this  country, without compensation or con- sideration of any kind, of a heavy charge which  we are under no obligation to meet and which I, as Chancellor of the Exchequer,  would find very  great difficulty in justifying to Parliament.  We do not object in any way, of course, to the issue by the Free State of a new coinage, but we do object to it being operated in such a way as to involve a quite unjustifiable and unnecessary burden on us.     Let me put the matter in another way.   There is a silver coinage now in circu- lation in Ireland, responsibility for which was taken over by the Free State when it was constituted, without any questions being raised.  If it is now desired to with- draw this currency and substitute a different  design, surely the right and reasonable course is to use the old coins for striking the new designs ?  This course would give rise to no difficulty or objection on our part,  and it provides  the Free State with its new coinage.   The only difference,&quot;&apos;in fact, from your proposal is that, under this arrangement, the profit of recoinage would be limited to the profit accruing from the alteration in the silver content of the new coinage, which we consider to be the only profit  that the Free State Government can fairly claim.     I  note that you suggest that our estimate  of  3 millions as the amount of British silver  in circulation in the Free state is much too high and  that the amount involved in the present discussion is only about  737,000.   I do not know how your figure is arrived at, but if, as appears, it refers to the face value of the first instalment of your new silver coinage, it is clearly not possible to confine the question.to that instalment, and we must deal  with  the  total  volume of  coinage that may ,be withdrawn.     I  do not wish  to deal with your letter  in  every detail; and I hope that the considerations outlined  above  will be  sufficient  to  persuade you that our attitude is not so unreasonable as you were inclined to suggest.   I  can  only repeat that the British Government are quite unable  to contemplate  the  prospect of large blocks of  silver  being withdrawn in the  Free  State  and  presented  as currency in this country;  and so strongly do my colleagues  and I feel on the subject that,  if ho reasonable arrangement can be arrived at, we shall feel bound to ask Parliament to give us the necessary powers to&apos; exclude such silver.   I should, however, for my part-be  very sorry if this course  proved necessary,  and I am  prepared to meet the representatives  of your  Government and to  explore the whole question freely.and frankly with them in  the hope that it may  be  possible  for  us  to reach some accommodation which will meet your requirements Avithout involving a charge upon the British taxpayer which we really cannot, in  present circumstances, contemplate. I suggest, therefore, that Mr. Blythe and an  expert adviser should come over in the-early autumn and discuss the matter with me and my advisers in this spirit.  -   rd     There is one other point to  which  I  ought  to  refer.   We have received representations from your Government regarding the notes  issued by Irish Banks-in the past and appertaining to Irish Free State territory which have been  lost or&apos; destroyed  and will  never be presented for  payment.   Compared with the question -of  the silver, this matter is a  small one, and I  think the  only financial interest; of your Government lies in a tax  which you would seek to impose  on the value of those dead notes.  I will not seek now to  argue this very technical question,  but I suggest that it might well be brought into the discussion of the silver question and disposed of at the same time.                                                          .;)
