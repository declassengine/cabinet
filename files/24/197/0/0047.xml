CONFIDENTIAL.Draft Circular Despatch to His  Majesty&apos;s Representatives in the Capitals of all    Countries represented  on the Preparatory Commission for  the  Disarmament    Conference.                            THE observations of the  Governments of the United                         States,  Italy  and  Japan  on the  British  and  French                         compromise proposals in the  matter of the limitation of                         naval armament having now been  received, the  present                         moment affords a convenient opportunity of presenting,                         for your information and guidance, an outline of recent                         discussions and correspondence on this subject.                            As a result of unauthorised and incomplete disclosures,.                         the nature and scope of this  compromise became, as you                         are aware, the object of public  speculation, often of an                         erroneous  and misleading  character.  His  Majesty&apos;s                         Government are contemplating  the early publication of                         papers, which, in  covering  as  briefly as  possible the                         history of the negotiations for naval disarmament, should                         serve to place the  matter in  its true perspective.  That                         they have refrained hitherto from publication has been                         due in part to their anxiety  not to embarrass the  other                         Governments concerned by what might have been regarded                         as an  attempt to  force their  hand,  in part to  their                         reluctance  to publish correspondence,  while still incom-                         plete, on a matter at once complex in its technical aspect                         and far-reaching in its results.                            The Anglo-French compromise cannot be regarded as                         a detached or isolated event;  it is the most recent link in                         a long chain of endeavour to implement  the  provisions                         embodied in Article 8 of the  Covenant of the  League of                         Nations to the effect that  &apos;&apos; the  members  of the League                         recognise  that the  maintenance of peace requires the                         reduction of national  armaments  to  the lowest point                         consistent with national safety.&quot;   The first steps taken                         by the League to fulfil this obligation were turned in the                         direction of comprehensive schemes of  mutual assistance                         in the belief  that  the  creation of a  general sense of                         security was the most promising avenue to an all-round                         reduction and  limitation of armaments.                            In the face of continued  failure to reach  agreement                         on any such scheme, this line of approach was abandoned                         in favour of more direct methods, and  in December 1925                         the Assembly set up a special commission with mandate                         to prepare  the ground for a general conference.   On the                         completion of certain preliminary researches on technical                         matters which monopolised  its attention  during  the                         ensuing year, this commission, known as the Preparatory                         Commission, attacked its main task at its third  session                         (March-April 1927), at which the British and  French                         representatives each put  forward  a  draft skeleton                         convention as  a basis of discussion.[18265]
    There  was  a wide divergence between these two drafts.  On the naval side the British draft provided for the  limitation  of  vessels  of  war  in  nine  separate categories; the French draft  for limitation,  broadly speaking,  by  total tonnage.   It was  between these two principles limitation by classes or limitation by total or &quot;global&quot;   tonnage that   the  chief  controversy has turned.    The  other  Governments represented on the Commission ranged themselves some on one side, some  on the  other.  Italy,  in particular,  supported the French thesis,  while  the  United  States,  who,  though  not a member  of the League  of Nations, is represented on the Preparatory Commission,  favoured the British plan  of limitation  by  classes while differing as to its application in  detail.   In  the hope  of bridging  this  divergence the  French delegation  some days later put  forward a  modified  proposal,  which   became known; as the French compromise proposal, and which  went so far  to meet the British view  as  to introduce classification by four  classes.    It  contained provision,  however, for unlimited transfer of tonnage from  one class to another, and  partly for that reason  and partly owing to the  small number  of  classes proved  inacceptable to the British delegation.   Confronted by these acute and  seemingly irreconci-lable divergences, and anxious to do nothing which might prejudice the  success of the Naval Conference, to which the United States Government had recently issued invita- tions, the  Preparatory Commission adjourned without having made any progress towards  an agreed text of a skeleton  convention.  Two  months later (June 1927) the Naval Conference met  in  Geneva, only to  break  down after seven weeks of effort  to adjust the differing points of view of  the Governments represented.   In  the  face  of the deadlock in  the  Preparatory Commission, followed  by  the  failure of  the  Geneva Conference, all prospect of immediate  progress appearedto be  extinguished.   The  French  and  English  draft conventions remained unreconciled, all attempts  to arrive at an agreed  text having  broken  down.  Informal com versations,  however,  were  frequent  at  Geneva;   navalexperts  discussed  the  different  points  of   view; thepolitical delegates also sought a  way out of the  impasse. These  talks ultimately culminated  in the conversation between  M. Briand  and  Sir  Austen Chamberlain  at Geneva in March 1928, which led to the compromise underreview.   In the course of  their discussions  Sir-Austen Chamberlain mentioned certain suggestions which had been made  by the British Admiralty and he subsequently communicated a written note of them to M. Briand at thelatter&apos;s  request.  They provided  for limitaion by six classes, all types of vessel being  included.   In considering the terms of this compromise it shouldbe borne in mind that the British contention had alwaysbeen for limitation in detail, the  French  contention for limitation  by  total tonnage.  Thus the original British plan had been for classification  by nine classes.  Under the modified British proposals, as submitted to M. Briand after the March conversation, the  number of classes had been reduced  to six, but included vessels of all types.On their side the French  Government, no less  anxious
than His Majesty&apos;s Government to promote agreement,had  shown a  disposition to  meet  the  British  thesisso far as  possible.   In  the  end  a compromise  wasreached  on  the   basis  of  a  limitation  applicableto four  classes of war vessel.  Like all compromises,these tentative proposals  involved  concessions  by bothsides.  They represented an advance from a position of difficulty and deadlock which had  prevailed  for over ayear.  While admittedly incomplete  as a final solution ofthe naval  limitation question, they  would, if  adopted,have added two  further  classes of vessel to  the  two classes limited under the Washington Treaty. They couldonly lead to useful results if the other  principal naval powers were ready to regard them as offering a possible basis for resumption of negotiation  in the PreparatoryCommission.   As,  in  the   matter  of  naval  disarmament,  thequestion  of  classification  versus   global  tonnage  had hitherto impeded  progress,  so,  in  the  matter of landdisarmament, the question of the limitation of  military-trained  reserves  had  proved  a stumble-Hock,French^ government  ana  /he Majority &quot;of the Sovern-ments represented on the Preparatory Commission hadne;lcl that  reserves should be excluded from  limitation,TVnile His Majesty&apos;s  Government, for reasons into whichit  is  here  unnecessary  to  enter, had  consistentlysupported the opposite thesis.   For some time,  however,they had realised that further opposition on their  part to the exclusion of these  trained reserves  could,  in the face of the attitude  of the majority of the PreparatoryCommission, only have the effect of preventing progressindefinitely.  So long ago as April 1927 the British repre-sentative  on the Commission  (Viscount  Cecil) clearlyforeshadowed the withdrawal,  for the sake of  agreement,of British opposition to the opinion held by the majorityof that  body.   When, therefore, the two  governments were advancing towards a compromise in the matter  ofnaval  limitation,  it was felt that  the process of agree-ment could only be facilitated  by a  formal  intimation tothe  French Government that a  concession made  to theviews  of His Majesty&apos;s Government on naval classifica-tion would enable them, to withdraw their  opposition  tothe French standpoint  in the matter of military-trainedreserves.   His Majesty&apos;s  Government have been  criticised onaccount of the  secrecy in which the negotiations described above are alleged to have taken place.  The facts are thatas long ago  as  March last  it  was announced in thePreparatory Commission that conversations were takingplace in the hope  of removing  the differences  which had hitherto obstructed progress.   When the  Anglo-Frenchcompromise proposals were ready for submission  to theother  naval Powers,  the  fact was announced by sir austen Chamberlain in the House of Commons.  I myselfgave to the press on the 30th August last a full account ofthe circumstances in  which the compromise was reached and  an  emphatic denial of the speculations as to theexistence of secret clauses and political understandings.The  whole  case is revealed in the correspondence, and any suggestions  to the  contrary  are  totally  devoid  offoundation.   ;  : : ;    ... :                        , ,,,,.  - The proposals thus  negotiated were submitted at theend  of  July to the Governments of the  United.

While theJapanese Government express  their  concurrence in thepurport  of these proposals,  the  Governments  of theUnited States and Italy,  for reasons which are clearlyand cogently explained in their notes, have not seen their way to accept them.
