I 9ox d) this  DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY  OP  HIS  BRITANNIC MATESTYr5CABINET.28).           BILL  FOR  INCREASING  BORROWING   OWgRS^ OP                        UNSMPL OYMENT  FUND.               Memorandum by the Minister of Labour,        As Indicated in my memorandum (C.P.244(28)) of   19th July last, it will be necessary to pass a Bill in the   early part of next Session Increasing the borrowing powers   of the Unemployment Fund under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.        The present limit of borrowing powers Is  30,0003 000.   Owing to the great volume of unemployment and the fall in the   revenue due to the reduction of contributions in 1926, the   amount actually borrowed from the Treasury was on   15th September,  27,000,000, and in addition there was a sum   of  500,000 representing sums due to the Treasury and unpaide        The revenue does not cover expenditure unless the live   register is below 1,000,000, and as the live register at   present is in the neighbourhood of 1,300,000, it is certain   that the borrowing powers will be exhausted before long,   though not, I hope, before the end of November.        In the memorandum of 19th July, I pointed out that this   further Increase in the borrowing powers makes it necessary   to &quot;re-examine the finances of the Unemployment Insurance   Scheme, for we clearly cannot contemplate the continuance of   a burden of debt of this kind, pointing as it does to a wrong                                                /relationship
1 9 0J. O) t?relationship between revenue and expenditure *   The loadof unemployment which we have oarried, and  are carrying,requires either a higher level of contributions or a lower level of benefits.&quot;     What I ask for now is authority to prepare a Bill,to be introduced at the beginning of next Session, and passed into law as soon as possible. The Bill will be quite short and restricted to the necessary financial provisions, the details of which will of course bediscussed beforehand with the Treasury,                               (Intd.)  A.  S-Ivl.Ministry of Labour*26th September, 1928.
