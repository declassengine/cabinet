THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT..                               CABINET.                        Railway Freight Relief.                           Coal for Ireland.               Memorandum by the ?!inlster of Transport.             In accordance  with one  Prime  Minister&apos;s announcement in   the House on the  24th July  last the rebates  from railway freights to   come into force on  the  1st  December in  anticipation of  the derating   scheme  will  be concentrated,  so far as  coal  traffic is  concerned,   upon coal for  export,  foreign bunkers,  and bunkers for  fishing   vessels,  and on coal  delivered  to  Iron  and Steel Works.   Bunker   coal for  coastwise  shipping and other coal shipped coastwise  will   be  excluded.             By existing Customs practice  coal  shipped to  Northern   Ireland is entered  as  &quot;shipped  coastwise&quot; while coal  shipped  to the   Irish Free State  is entered as  &quot;exported&quot;.   A similar distinction   applies in the case of the  bunkers  so that if Customs practice were   followed,  coal for  the Free  State  would be entitled to  the rebates   while coal for Northern  Ireland would not.             The  Government  of  Northern Ireland have unofficially   represented  that  any  such difference in treatment between the two   parts of  Ireland  would be prejudicial to  the  ports and  railways   of  Northern  Ireland as tending  to  cai?:se a diversion of  traffic   from their routes to  those via  ports and  railways in  the South.   It  is not possible  to say to  what  extent  such diversion would take   place,  but that it  might  occur  is  evident.   In that event strong   representations would no  doubt  be made  that an unfair position   had been  created, and pressure  be brought to  bear to  extend the   rebates to coal for Northern  Ireland.   Apart  from these   considerations there  appear to  be no economic grounds for giving   consumers in the  Free State advantages  not extended to  consumers   either  in Northern  Ireland or in Great  Britain.   I am informed   that  there are no blast furnaces in Ireland.BET280( 28).
                                                               1r ey                           -2-          It therefore seems desirable that coal for any partof Ireland should be excluded from the benefit of the rebatescheme.          As a result of informal discussion with the dominions office and the Home Office I understand that in the view ofboth those departments differential treatment of the two partsof Ireland in this matter might well involve political difficulties, but no such difficulty is anticipated from the exclusion of all coal shipped to Ireland from the benefits of the scheme.          We have in addition, the following &quot;arguments uponwhich the exclusion of the Free State could be justified :-(1)       The rebates in question are to be given in respect     of the charges for conveyance by railway, and under ordinary     railway practice shipment rates apply equally to; coal to be     carried coastwise and to coal for export, and therefore     aPPly to coal for Northern Ireland and for the Free State.(2)       The Irish Free State (Consequential Adaptation of     Enactments) Order 1923, while providing that for Customs     and Postal purposes the Free State in re^Jjtion to any part     of Great Britain or Northern Ireland is to be deemed to be     parts beyond the sea, also provides that a ship trading     between a port in Great Britain and a port in the Irish     Free State shall be deemed to be employed in the coasting     trade for the purposes of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894-     and of any enactment relating to charges leviable by a     port or harbour authority in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.     By this provision the Free State obtains the benefit of the     lower scales of Harbour dues applicable to vessels engaged     in the coasting trade, notwithstanding its status for Customs     purposes.
JL                                       (Intd, )    \f. A.26th September,  1928, (3)       Special treatment has been accorded to the Free State     in connexion with the importation of cattle and meat into     Great Britain.   Certain restrictions applicable to imported     cattle do not apply when the animals are brought from any     part of Ireland, while for the purposes of the regulations     governing the importation of meat into Great Britain, meat     from the Free State is treated on the same basis as home     killed meat.          I suggest that coal sent to the Channel Islands,which by Customs practice would be export coal should also be excluded from the benefit.of the scheme.   shipments to the isle of Man are entered by the Customs as &quot;coastwise&quot; and will in anycase be excluded.          If my Colleagues agree to the above proposals, inwhich I understand that the Mines Department and the Board ofTrade concur, it will probably be advisable t&apos;o find some termother than &quot;coal for export&quot; to describe the traffic to whichthe rebate is to be applied and no drafting difficulty in so doingis anticipated.
