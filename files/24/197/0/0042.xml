Printed for the Cabinet.  October 1928. .SECRET.                                                     Copy  No!     28CP. 29.3  (28).         I                        CABINET.REDUCTION  OP ARMAMENTS.Naval  Limitation.                 NOTE BY  THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER.    1 VENTURE to circulate this telegram which was drafted by me and sent towLord  Balfour at &quot;Washington on  the 17th December, 1921.  I was at that timeacting as Chairman of the Committee  of  Imperial Defence and I drafted  this telegram for the Prime Minister,  Mr. Lloyd George, who cordially agreed  with itand dispatched  it without making any alteration.  I  venture to think that the opinions adopted by Mr. Lloyd George in Part III are worthy of note.                                                                   W.  S.  C.    Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,          October 6, 1928.                                  Telegram. ;            it               From :  Prime Minister.      ,      X                  To: Mr. Balfour.Personal.  Secret.  Absolute Priority.    Your 162; 167, 168 and 169.    We  have considered  in consultation with First  Sea Lord the very seriousdecisions to which you have come.  We consider you were  quite right in all thecircumstances prevailing  on the  spot, of which you  are far the  best  judge, toact without  reference to the  Cabinet.  We do not  see how  you could avoidmaking  the Sacrifices involved  in the capital ship agreement.  We also adhere to all we have  said  about the  importance  of  the ten  years&apos;  naval holiday.This  period fdf  arrest from building  is now bridged  to  some extent  by  theconstruction :i&apos;bf  the  two  ships  agreed  upon,  and  the unproductive  expenseof keeping  our  constructive  plant  in being  is to some  extent  relieved.   we hope, therefore,  though this is not the naval view,  that  you  will continue toaccept this complete naval holiday without reservations.   Importance is, however,attached to the definition  of the tonnage limit for the  two  new ships we are nowto build.  The Admiralty, of course, regret having to abandon the  design of thetwo super- &quot; Hoods,&quot; but good ships can be built within the limits prescribed solong as it is clearly understood that &quot;British legend tonnage&quot; is adopted as the sole  standard regulating  size of capital ships.  We presume this will  apply toall calculations in regard to capital ships to be retained for the line of battle.  Wedeprecate being drawn into meticulous definitions of tonnage such as are proposedby the  American experts as  described by  Admiral Chatfield  in  his  telegram to the  First  Sea Lord.  This  will  give  unlimited opportunities  for unfairinterpretations,  for dispute  about what is actually being done, and  for reciprocalinspection to an intolerable  extent by  every naval Power signatory to the agree-      [18257]
ment.   &quot; British legend tonnage &quot;, is  perfectly well .understood in every Navy andshould be accepted as the sole rule by which we can be bound.   Having made the sacrifices  which matter far more to us  than to any other Power in respect  ofcapital  ships, we feel that the safety of the Empire  does not  enable us to.go anyfurther in other classes.                                                       -    Part II.   The United States proposal  about aircraft carriers is, for instance,unintentionally unfair to us.  They  would  permit them to build in the (light: of,every modern development brand new aircraft carriers of the largest size, while weshould  be  prevented from adding in any way to our old vessels of this class, themajority  of  which  are  quite obsolete.  We  consider  that the aircraft  carrierconstruction should  be  based upon  the  same principles as have  regulated thecapital  ship  agreement, viz., the ratio of,. 5, 5, 3 should be accepted between thethree leading naval.Powers, both for aggregate tonnage and numbers, an individualtonnage limit of, say, 25,000 tons per ship  should be agreed upon, and that thereshould be liberty for new construction of ship for ship within these limits.    Part III.  We  welcome your decision to press for the total abolition  of submarines.   Even if you can obtain this  we wish to be consulted before a finaldecision is taken upon the limited scales  of construction in small craft permitted to the  various signatories.   The   position  of  Britain  with  her   world-widepossessions and food supplies on the one  hand clearly require an entirely differentstandard to  that acceptable by self-contained nations.   We apprehend, however,that there is very little chance of abolition  of submarines being  agreed upon, andin this event we must insist at all  costs upon absolute freedom in regard to thecharacter and numbers of all vessels  under, say, 10,000  tons.  We cannot in the face of French freedom  to  construct a great  submarine  fleet, to say  nothing of american submarine and cruiser construction  and that  of&apos; other  Powers, enterinto any agreement fettering our liberty to  build whatever numbers and classes of cruisers and  anti-submarine craft we may  think necessary to  the maintenance ofnational and Imperial life.  We feel  sure from our knowledge of your outlook onthe whole problem that you will share this view to the full.  Even at the cost of acomplete rupture you should not agree to any restriction  in this sphere without previous consultation of the Cabinet.    Part IV. With  regard  to fortifications in the Pacific, you  say Singapore isnot mentioned.  We presume - you  mean  by this  that  we are free  to  developSingapore as a first-class naval base if we think it necessary to  do so.  This we regard  as indispensable  and we hope you  will make sure there is no misunder-standing with the Americans and still more the Japanese on this pojnt.  As youare aware from discussions over  which you have presided in the  Gpmmittee ofImperial Defence, the defence of Australia and  New Zealand might  in certaincircumstances depend entirely upon Singapore;            -                oi  .    Part  V.   We think that the whole arrangements ultimately come to should include provision  for a  conference between the signatory Powers iii case of anydecisive modification  of existing  situation  either through some entirely  hewinvention or the development of  the Navy of some non-signatory Power.   this feeling on our part is due to the far more vulnerable position which  . we occupyin naval matters  compared  to any other  nation.  We do not  of  course desire  to imply any wish to diminish the  fundamental securities for peace and disarmamentcontained in the agreements now being arrived at.     nth December,  1921.                                           i        ,
