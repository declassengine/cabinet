    [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government. 1                     Printed for the Cabinet.  October 1928.SECRET.                                                     Copy No.   28CP. 285  (28).                                 CABINET.FUNCTIONS OF  DOMINION  MINISTERS.            Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.      CORRESPONDENCE has been proceeding with the Canadian and Irish Free  State Governments as to the appointment of a Canadian Minister at Paris and the  proposed appointment of Irish Free State Ministers at Paris and Berlin, and in this  connection  both Dominions have raised the question  of  the phraseology  to be  employed in the notes to the French and German Governments, in so far as it relates  to the respective  functions  of  the  Dominion  Ministers and of  His Majesty*s  Ambassadors at the foreign capitals concerned.      Copies of  the notes addressed to the United States Government as regards the  appointment of Irish Free State and Canadian Ministers at Washington are annexed  (Appendix (A)).  It will be noted that in each case a definite distinction was drawn  between matters relating to the Irish Free State or Canada (in the former case the  words are &quot; exclusively relating &quot;), and &quot;matters which are of Imperial concern or  which affect other Dominions,&quot; which latter were to continue to be handled as here-  tofore &apos;&apos; by the Embassy.&apos;&apos;  This definition in the second paragraph of each of the  notes was followed, in  the third  paragraph,  by a statement that the arrangements  &quot; would not denote any departure from the principle of the diplomatic unity of the  Empire.  The  Irish (or Canadian)  Minister  would be at all times in closest touch,  with His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, &amp;c.&quot;      The Canadian Government, in a telegram of the 17th August, expressed their  view as follows            &quot; We  have been led to conclude, on further consideration  of the form used      in notifying the United States Government of the proposed establishment of the      Canadian Legation in Washington, that some variation would be more consistent      with the conclusions of the Imperial Conference, 1926, and with actual practice.      It  does not seem  necessary to make any  specific  affirmation,  such as  was      contained  in Mr.  Chilton&apos;s note No. 723 of the 19th November, 1926,  as to-      whether or not the diplomatic unity of the Empire is affected by the arrangement,      and the phrasing of the  preceding paragraph of his note might be taken to imply      that Canadian Ministers would be excluded from dealing jointly or individually      with any questions which affect other parts of the Empire as well (as for example      the multilateral pact for the renunciation  of war).  Accordingly,  we would      suggest that in this respect the following wording would be desirable :  &apos; Such      a Minister would  be accredited by His Majesty the King to the President of      France, and he would be furnished  with credentials which would enable him      to take charge of all affairs which concern His Majesty&apos;s Government in Canada.      He would be the ordinary channel of communication with the French Govern-      ment on these matters.  Matters which concern His Majesty&apos;s Governments in      Great Britain or in other Dominions will continue to be handled as heretofore      by this  Embassy.   The Canadian Minister will be at all times in closest touch,      and any question which may  arise as to method in which any matter should be      dealt with will be settled by  consultation between them.....&apos; &quot;      The Irish Free State Government, when notifying their proposals in despatches  of the 3rd  August, intimated that, in their  view, the procedure outlined in  the  second paragraph  of the note to  the United States Government of the 24th June,i      [18233]                                                         B
 1924, required amendment to bring it into harmony with the present constitutional relationship of the Members of the Commonwealth, but they  did not in these despatches define precisely the alterations of phraseology which they desired.     The question, in so far as it related to the appointment of the Canadian Minister at  Paris, was discussed  between the Prime Minister of Canada  and the  Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the 27th August, when Mr. Mackenzie King explained that he was very anxious to have the wording settled in order that the Legation might be opened by the 3rd October.  Lord Cushendun intimated  that he could not, on his own authority, approve any  departure from the wording  used in the Washington case,  and a  Cabinet decision  would be indispensable; if, however, Mr.  Mackenzie  King could accept  the  Washington  precedent, the  necessary formalities  could be expedited so as to make possible the opening  of the Legation by  the  date desired.   In the circumstances,  Mr. Mackenzie King agreed to the adoption of  the  Washington  formula,  &quot; leaving to a  more  convenient  season consideration of such modification  as may be deemed advisable by a supplementary communication, if necessary, of the wording employed in the notification.&quot;   A note was accordingly addressed to the French Government in this form  (see Appendix (B)).    The Irish Free State Government (who were made aware  of what  had been agreed  in the case of Canada) have now explained their views in more detail in the despatch which  is annexed (Appendix  (C)).   It will be seen that they do not appear  to raise any objections to the retention of  paragraph 3 of the Washington note.   Their general view is expressed in the following words :          &quot; While they are in  favour of the closest co-operation between the  British    Ambassador and the  Irish Minister in all  matters that may be deemed to be of    common interest, or of interest to more than one Government of the Common-    wealth  of Nations, they  feel that  all matters whatsoever that may affect the    interests of the Irish  Free State should be dealt with by the Irish Minister.&quot;    It seems almost certain that Mr. Mackenzie King, while he  is in this country, will revert to the subject, and it is necessary to consider both what should be said to him  if he raises  the question of modification of the  wording employed  in  the note to  the French Government of the 28th August and what reply should be sentto the Irish Free State Government.    I think that it is of the utmost importance to retain the paragraph in the note which deals with diplomatic unity,  but, subject to the retention of this paragraph,my  view is that it is  a mistake to try to lay down a hard and fast definition of whatis Imperial or common, and  to exclude Dominion Ministers at foreign capitals fromany discussion which may come within that definition.   It would be impossible forDominion Governments, even if they wished  to do so, to keep  within any suchdefinition in the Dominion  capital,  and to decline even to discuss  with a foreignrepresentative at that capital  any matter which could be regarded as affecting otherparts of the Empire.   It  seems to me that we must accept and make the best of theposition, that they will say in such  a case that they will be quite ready to discussany such matter, but that it is a question of  wider interest on which it is necessaryto consult with the rest of  the Empire before answering the foreign representative.    In  this connection, I might observe that a departure has been made from  theprinciple of  the Washington  formula in  connection with the Kellogg Pact, whichultimately  affects the  whole  Empire.   This was clearly  a case in which,  if  the restriction  imposed  by the Washington  formula was  to be maintained, discussion should have  been conducted solely  with the Ambassador.  Again, at Geneva, wehave accepted the position that the powers and responsibilities of Dominion repre- sentatives cover all  subjects.   If the  Secretary of  State for Foreign Affairs ever speaks for  the whole Empire  at Geneva, it is only  after having assured himself by cnnsultation that he is in a position to do so.    Moreover, as the Free State Government contend, the attempt to draw  a hard and fast line between what  is local  and what is common would not appear to be in accordance with the  conclusions of the Imperial Conference of 1926.   The essence of the position, as recognised  at the  Imperial Conference,  is that every one  of HisMajesty&apos;s Governments has  an unlimited field of  authority coupled with  a realmeasure of responsibility for the common interest.  The difficulties arising from this situation can, I submit, only be solved (a) by a determination on thepart of  all the Governments of the Empire  to maintain a  united front  to the  outside world  inessentials;  (b) by systematic  consultation at Dominion capitals between Dominion jrovernments and British  representatives, and at foreign capitals or Geneva between
 all the representatives. Foreign Governments, knowing where the centre of gravity- is, will, in fact, on the big issues, go to London or to the British Ambassador at their capital.  The question is,  no doubt, one of considerable difficulty, but I feel that it is clearly  impossible  to  attempt  to retain  diplomatic unity  by definition  of subject matters.  On the other hand, the vitally important thing seems to me to  be that we should retain the insistence  on diplomatic unity as the affirmation, both for ourselves and for the outside world, of a fundamental principle.     It will be seen that the Canadian  Governments objection to the affirmation of the principle of diplomatic unity is based on the preceding paragraph of Mr. Chilton&apos;s note (Appendix (A) ), which,  in fact,  contains a definition of issues of Imperial concern, &amp;c.  The  line which I  should like  to be authorised to  take, therefore, in discussing the matter with Mr. Mackenzie King, is to meet the fundamental objection of the Canadian Government by agreeing to the omission of any such paragraph.  But I would insist on the retention of the general declaration of diplomatic unity with its reference to consultation,  &amp;c,  as no less essentially ia the  spirit of the 1926 Conference than the elimination  of any definition.  The formula I should therefore like to see adopted is the following :          &quot;Such a Minister would be accredited by His Majesty  the  King to the    President of the French Republic,  and he would be furnished with credentials    which would enable him to take charge  of all affairs relating to Canada.   He    would be the ordinary channel of communication with  the French Government    on these matters.  The  arrangements proposed would not denote any departure    from  the principle of  the diplomatic unity of the Empire.  The  Canadian    Minister  would be  at all  times  in the closest  touch with His  Majesty;s    Ambassador, and the  best method of dealing with any question which may arise    which may  concern more than one  of His Majesty&apos;s Governments or the whole    of the British Empire would be settled by consultation.&quot;    If the Cabinet approve  of my adopting this line with Mr. Mackenzie King,  andthe formula proposed above is accepted by him, I should propose to take a similar  line in discussing the matter with the Free State Government.

UNDER instructions from Lord Cushendun, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that His Majesty&apos;s Governments in Great Britain and Canada have come to the conclusion that it is desirable that the handling of  matters at Paris relating to  Canada  should   be   confided  to   an  Envoy   Extraordinary  and  Minister Plenipotentiary accredited to the Government of the Republic.   Such a Minister would be  accredited  by  His Majesty  The  King to the  President  of the French Republic,  and would be furnished with credentials which  would enable him to take charge of all  affairs  relating to Canada.   He would be the ordinary channel of communication with the Government of the Republic on these matters.    2.  Matters which are of Imperial concern or which  affect other Dominions in the Commonwealth in common with Canada will continue to be handled as heretoforeby this Embassy.    3.  The arrangements proposed by His Majesty&apos;s Governments would not denote any  departure  from the principle of  the diplomatic unity  of  the  Empire.  The Canadian Minister would be at all times in the closest touch with His Majesty&apos;ambassador, and any question which may arise as to whether a matter comes withinthe category of those to be handled by the Canadian Minister or not would be settled by consultation between them.   The Canadian  Minister  being  responsible to HisMajesty&apos;s Government in Canada would not be subject to  the control of His Majesty&apos;ambassador, nor would His Majesty&apos;s  Ambassador be responsible for the Canadian ministers actions.    4.  In communicating to  you these  proposals, which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentstrust will promote the maintenance and development of cordial relations between theBritish Empire  and  France,  I  have been instructed to express the hope that theGovernment of the Republic will concur in the appointment of a  Canadian Ministerat Paris on the footing I  have  indicated above.   As regards questions such as theprecedence to be attributed to the Canadian Minister, or any other points which theGovernment of the Republic may desire to raise in connection with the appointment,the views of the Government of the Republic will be awaited.

Confidential.)               Department of[External Affairs,Sir,                                       Irish Free State, September&quot; 19, 1928.    I HAVE the honour to refer to my Confidential despatches of the 3rd Augustregarding the appointment of Irish Free State Ministers at Paris and Berlin.    2.   His Majesty&apos;s  Government in the Irish Free  State  have given carefulconsideration to the wording of the Note used in notifying the proposed appointmentof an Irish Free State Minister to Washington, and have come to the conclusion that,to be in accord with  the conclusions of the Imperial Conference, 1926,  considerableamendments are necessary.    3.   While they  are in favour of the closest  co-operation between the british ambassador and the Irish Minister in all matters that may be deemed to be of common interest or of interest to more than one Government of the Commonwealth of Nations,they feel that all matters whatsoever that may affect the interests of the Irish FreeState should be dealt with by the Irish Minister.   Furthermore, they  are satisfiedthat the conclusions of the Imperial Conference agree with their point of view in thismatter.  That being so, it appears that paragraph 2 of the Note should be deleted, asit tends to imply that matters of Irish concern should be  taken  out of the hands oftheir Minister.
    4.  As the words &quot; only &quot; and  &quot; exclusively &quot; in the fourtn and ninth lines ofthe first paragraph of the Washington Note obviously have reference to the second paragraph which should now  be deleted,  His Majesty&apos;s Government consider thatthose words should also be deleted as being no longer necessary.    5.  Being anxious to proceed with the creation of the posts in Paris and Berlinwith as little delay as possible, they would be glad if His Majesty&apos;s Government inGreat Britain would intimate their concurrence in these views at the earliest moment.                                                I have, &amp;c.                                        (Signed)      P.
