if(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAHNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT)                                                   Copy  No-CP. 253  (88).CABINETREDUCTION AND LIMITATION  OP  ARMAMENTS.COMMITTEE ON POLICY.REPORTSECRET
lo   We held a meeting at 11 = 30 a.m, on July 84th,           ^to consider certain questions in regard to the reduction and  Imitation of Armaments and the Private Manufactureof Arms *   We deal with these questions belowoFRENCH PROPOSALS (JULY 1928) FOR LIMITATION Off NAVALARMAMENTSn2,   In regard to these proposals, which are set oat inAppendix I to this Report, two questions arise for consider-ation - (a) whether the proposals are in themselves accepta--ble and, if so (b) what procedure should be adopted inputting thenyforward .3.   With regard to (a) the proposals involve the classi-fication of wax-ships  into 4 categories, of which thefirst two - capital ships and aircraft carriers - coincide with the classification which has always been advocated by Great Britain.  The other two categories involve,  forall Powers, a maximum tonnage in respeot of surface vesselscarrying guns of a greater calibre than 6&quot; and in i-espectof ocean-going submarines of over 600 tons.  No limitationis proposed for surface vessels carrying guns of 6&quot; calibreand under,  or for small submarines.   The proposals are,therefore,  essentially a compromise between the French andBritish points of view.  In so far as the last two categoriesare concerned,  it will be observed that the British contentionis met in that there will be liberty to maintain as many small cruisers as may be desired;  on the other hand  there isno limitation in regard to small submarines,  which does tosome extent constitute a danger to British shipping In the narrow home waters.  It must be appreciated,  however,  thatthese small submarines are claimed by the French Admiralty tobe &quot;defensive&quot; vessels, and it is suggested that the real danger to be apprehended from submarines is from the largeocean-going type which is essentially &quot;aggressive&quot; in characterWe understand that the Admiralty realise that this is not thewhole truth but is nevertheless prepared to/
 accept the risk involved in the interests of securing an agree-ment with the French..  It will farther be observed that theproposals provide for a maximum tonnage in regard to categories (ill) and (iv) for all Powers.  In effect this means that in theory there will be the right to parity not only as betweenGreat Britain and the United States of America, and between france and Italy, but also as between, say, Franoe and the UnitedStates of America and Japan and the United States of America.No doubt such a right, even in theory, will not meet with readyacceptance on the part of the United States of innerica, but asthe champions of parity, they will find it difficult to produce                                 of coursearguments for its rejection.  It is.not contemplated, however,that this right to build up to the maximum will be exercised in      Under para. 4 of the French proposalspractice. / each State is to indicate the extent to which it proposes to exercise this right,  and If it appears that any oneState is exceeding its justifiable requirements in this direction,it is open to any other State to refuse to be bound by the figures which it has already indicated for its own programme,CONCLUSION.               So far as the proposals are concerned,therefore,               we consider that they may be accepted as a               satisfactory compromise.     With regard to fb) - the procedure to be adopted in putting the proposals forward, we suggest that the Foreign secretary should intimate to the French Ambassador that the proposals are acceptable to Great Britain and that a formal acknowledgement tothis effect will be given as soon as they are formally receivedfrom the French Government.  The proposals then might be communi-cated to the Governments of the  United States of iimerica,  japan and Italy as constituting a compromise jointly arrived  at betweenthe British and French Governments,  while IS..  Louden,  the Presidentof the Preparatory Commission at Geneva,  might be informed pri-vately by the Foreign Secretary that the conversations on naval armaments between Great Britain and  France have been brought toa successful issue and that so far as this question is concernedthere is no need to delay further the next meeting of thePreparatory Commission.
4e   The German proposals for Publicity involve the periodical submission to the League of Nations of anumber of Tables relating to the scale of armaments,and the condition of such industries as are adaptableto warlike purposes.   In addition they Include the giving of information in regard to changes of organlsa-tion and material In military programmes.     There Is no need to trouble the Cabinet with thedetails of these proposals *   It will suffice to statethat the first nine tables which refer to &quot;effectives&quot;,are acceptable to the Fighting Services, as are alsothe proposals in regard to military programmes.   Thelast two tables (XIII and XIV) which refer to industriesengaged in the manufacture of war material etc, are by unanimous consent judged to be unacceptable.   Thereremain for consideration therefore only Tables X to XII??hich have to do with material in the scale of armaments,The Fighting Departments are united In the view that theseTables should be rejected.   It was urged,  on the otherhand that, unless the diirulgenoe of the information whichthey contained was  really harmful from the point of viewof national  security, they should be accepted on political grounds.   We feel  however that, since these three Tablesare closely  allied  to Tables XIII and XIV which deal withindustries and since these latter have, by unanimousconsent to be rejected,  the  integrity of the proposalshas already  to a large extent been destroyed.   Furtherwe feel that without some system of control the moralvalue  of  the information to  be contained in these Tables
Is lost, since in, times of stress and internationalsuspicion, the figures shown therein, even ifscrupulously accurate, would never he accepted unless they had been verified by some independent tribunal.-We need hardly remind the Cabinet that it has been frequentlylaid down not only by our own Government but by others aswell that no system of international control or supervisionwould be tolerated.   CONCLUSION.          We consider therefore that the German      Proposals for publicity should only be accepted.      In so far as &quot;Eff ectives58 (Tables I to IX)      and Military Programmes are concerned, provided      that information In regard to the latter      is confined to that which is normally presented      t o Par 1 lame nt.          In order to enable the British Representative      at Geneva to be provided with all the technical      arguments which can be adduced against Tables X      to XIV, we suggest that the Fighting Departments      should be instructed to draw up memoranda for      his guidance.5.   MODEL TREATY TO STRENGTHEN THE  SANS OF PREVENTING WAR,     Arising out of the German Proposals for the Preventionof War, which were the subject of consideration by theCabinet in June last  (Cabinet 34 (28) Conclusion 5),the Committee on Arbitration and Security at Geneva has produced a Model Treaty to Strengthen the Means of preventing War.     As a model, this Treaty does not at this Stage require any decision on the part of His Majestyfs Government as towhether they will adhere to it or not, but In view of possible developments in the future, it would be inadvisable to let it be thought that lack of criticismat the time when this Model was under considerationImplied that His MajestyTa Government was in agreementwith Its provisions.   In point of fact, the Model,on account of its vague language and Imperfections
  if for no- other reasons,of drafting/Is not one which we could ever recommend for adoption by His Majestyfs Government.   CONCLUSION $.          We suggest therefore that we should be       empowered without further reference to the       Cabinet to draft criticisms on this Model       for the guidance of the British representative       at Geneva,6a   SCHEME FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO STATES VICTIMS                     OP&quot;AMrT SSTd!n     The Finnish  scheme for financial assistance toStates victims of aggression is one which has from itsInception commended Itself to His Majesty&apos;s Government0The latest developments in this connection involve proposalswhich require to be studied by the Treasury and theForeign Office.   We understand that steps have alreadybeen taken for such a study to be undertaken,   CONCLUSION,    We suggest that the Cabinet should instruct the Departments concerned (Treasury and ForeignOffice) to submit their views to us in sufficient time for them to be considered before the Recess.,and that we should be empowered, without further reference to the Cabinet unless such a course should seem to us to bo necessary, to draft instructions for the guidance of the british representative, when this question comes up forconsideration by the Assembly in Geneva07,   PRIVATE MANUFACTURS OF arms     We attach hereto   - as Appendix II - a reportby the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial defence on the Private Manufacture of Arms, etc    We endor-30the view set out in the second paragraph of this Reportthat athe provision of any convention in regard
to the Private Manufacture of Arms should also beapplied to the manufacture of similar articles carriedout in State-owned or State-controlled factories.x x x x x  and that His Majesty&apos;s Government should onlyagree to adhere to the Convention on the expressunderstanding that its provisions are applicable alsoto State Manufacture1&apos;,     Most of the detailed amendments in the attached report are consequential on the above recommendation and need not be the subject of further observation.CONCLUSION.            We therefore recommend that the Cabinet           should approve the report in Appendix II           as the basis of the instructions of the           British Representative at Geneva, when           this Convention comes up for consideration-.

Ammunition and implement a of War.1.   By the Prime Minister*s direction we have had underconsideration the Report of the Special Commission of theLeague of Nations and the Preliminary Draft Conventionprepared by this Special Commission with regard to the supervision of the Private Manufacture, and Publicity ofthe Manufacture of Arms and Ammunition and of implements of war.   A copy of this Draft Convention Is attached as appendix I to this Bsport.2.   Before passing to a detailed examination of theArticles contained in this Draft Convention, we wish topoint out at the outset that in our opinion the provisionsof any Convention in regard to the Private Manufacture ofArms should also be applied to the manufacture of similararticles carried out in State-owned or State-controlledfactories.   If this course is not adopted, the states the armaments of which are produced in State factorieswill be placed in an unduly advantageous position inrelation to the States who rely almost entirely on privateundertakings to supply them with their requisite armaments.Indeed, we recoramend for the consideration of His Majesty1 sGovernment, that they should only agree to adhere to theConvention, on the express understanding that  its provisions are applicable also to State manufacture.
3*   With this preliminary observation we turn to a detailed examination of the Convention itself.   It will be observedthat this draft is the result of an attempt made last yearby a drafting Committee at Geneva to oombine an earlierdraft - also prepared at Geneva - with various amendmends and observations submitted by the delegations represented on the Special Commission.   It contains, therefore, in some instances alternative texts printed in parallel columns.For convenience of reference we attach hereto, as Appendix II,a copy of this draft, which shows in italics those passageswhich have already been accepted by His Majesty&apos;s government or are now recommended for acceptance.preamble *          We recommend that of the alternative texts of     paragraph 3, that in the left hand column should be     adopted, as its wording is such as to cover manufacture     by the State, in addition to manufacture by private    &apos; undertakings.Article 1.          This article sets out the Categories of arms,     ammunition and implements of war - and has already     been accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government.Article 2.          We recommend that this article should be accepted,     except for the words &quot;excluding in all cases manufacture     on the order and behalf of the State&quot;, which are     inconsistent with our reooraraendation that State     manufacture should also be governed by the Convention.
Article 3.          We recommend that this Article should be accepted     with the exclusion of Category IV - aircraft and aircraft     engines - since It is not practicable tc draw a satis-     factory line between warlike and non-warlike aircraft and     engines.   Further if the return should include both civil     and military aircraft, by means of a simple calculation It     would  be easy  to deduce  the numbers of aircraft maintained     in reserve for the Air Force.   It will be appreciated that     this latter argument  Is probably unsuited for use at Geneva.     The  exclusion  of this Category has already been approved by     His  Majesty&apos;s  Government. Article  4.          We  recommend  the acceptance  of  this Article. Article  5.          We  recommend  :-           (a)  Acceptance of  the text  in the right  hand  column               of the  first  paragraph,  with the  addition of the               words &quot;compile  and&quot;  befofe  the word  &quot;transmit&quot;  in               the second line.           (b)  Rejection of the second paragraph and the Annex               referred to therein, as it  has already been agreed               by His Majesty&apos;s Government that  It  is both un-               desirable and  impracticable to give  details as  to               the number and weight of the articles concerned.            (c) Acceptance of the third paragraph,  with the               exclusion of &quot;Category IV&quot;, for the  same reasons               as are given under Article 3 above,            (d)Acceptance of the fourth paragraph,  for the reasons               given In paragraph 2 of this Report. Article 6.            We recommend the acceptance of this Article with the       exclusion of  the  ?Jords  &quot;on behalf of the State&quot; at the end       of the first  paragraph.   By the terms of the Treaty of       Washington we are obliged to Inform the other /                                -3-
e           Contracting Powers  in regard to the  const ruction of           any vessel of war for a non-Contracting Power,           and it is very desirable tha&apos;t this obligation should           be made applicable  also to the States who are not           parties toi the Washington Treaty.      Article 7.                We recommend the acceptance of  this Article.      Article 8.                We recommend the rejection of this Article, as           the Annex has already been rejected  (vide remarks on           Art i cle 5 above)9      Article 9.                We recommend acceptance of the  first two lines,           down to the word &quot;belligerents&quot;.  We are doubtful           however, of the wisdom of accepting  the remainder of           this Article.,  Admittedly in the event of a large           world war, the application of the Convention would be           suspended.  But there seems no reason why its applica-           tion should be suspended In the event of a small war,           which only affects a limited number  of States.           The Article as at present worded would enable any           neutral State to seize on the opportunity of any war,           however small, as an excuse for claiming exemption,           and thus the whole Convention might become  a dead           letter.  We do not wish to lay any great emphasis on           this point, but we think that the British Representative           might be instructed to bring it forward when the           Convention is under consideration at  Geneva.      Articles 10   16.                We recommeud the acceptance of these Articles.                                          (Sd.)

REPORT  OF  THE  SPECIAL  COMMISSION  TO THE  COUNCIL.    The Special Commission appointed by decision of the Council dated December 9th, 1926,for the purpose of framing a final draft which would be used as a basis for discussion at anInternational Conference for the Supervision of the Private Manufacture of Arms and Ammu-nition and of Implements of War held its first session  at  Geneva from March 14th to April25th,  1927.    The Commission appointed a Drafting Committee from  among  its members to examinethe preliminary draft framed by the Committee of Enquiry of the Committee of the Council,and also the amendments, proposals and observations submitted by its own members.  these amendments, proposals  and observations are to be found  annexed  to the  present report(Annex II).    As the result of its study,  the Drafting Committee  presented to the plenary commission a report the text of which is as  follows :    &quot;At the meeting held on March  14th, 1927,  the Special  Commission requested the dele-gations to submit such observations as they might desire on the preliminary draft convention which the Council had referred to it,  and appointed a Drafting Committee to prepare, in thelight of the amendments proposed, a new text which might serve as a basis for its discussions-    &quot;Amendments were submitted by  the  American,  Belgian, British,  Italian, japanese and Netherlands delegations.   The Drafting Committee took note of them at its meetings onApril 19th and  20th, 1927.    &quot;It found that these amendments were  based in the  main on two different principles :in  some  cases  on  the principle set forth in paragraph 5 of Article  8 of the Covenant andin other cases on the principle formulated in paragraph 2 of the Final Act of the  conference for the  Supervision of the International Trade in Arms and Ammunition and in implements of War.  The first group thus referred exclusively to  the supervision of private manufacture and the other to publicity in regard to manufacture in general.    &quot;The Drafting Committee was not able in every case to reconcile such different points of view.  On the other hand, it did not feel authorised to choose between them.   It has thusbeen obliged to  submit to the  Commission a preliminary draft (Annex I), which offers alter-native texts for certain  articles.  It will be for the Commission itself  either to choose between these or to find a new text which might meet with unanimous agreement.    &quot;In regard  to Article^ 1, certain members of the Committee pointed  out that the  listswhich it provides for were imperfect and that the proposed Conference should have power toexamine them and, if necessary, to revise them.    &quot;In regard to Article 2, the Committee had  to consider  a British  amendment framed asfollows : &apos;After the words : &quot;of which the State is not the sole proprietor&quot;, insert the phrase :&quot;and which are mainly  or to a large extent engaged in the manufacture of the said  articles&quot; &apos; ;and an Italian and Japanese amendment, the text of which is as follows  : Tnsert after thearticle as it stands : &quot;excluding in all cases manufacture on the order and behalf of the State&quot; &apos;.The Committee decided not to embody these amendments in its draft but to bring them tothe notice of the Commission, as the latter alone has power to settle  the important questionsof principle involved.    &quot;In Article 3, the Committee considered the Netherlands amendments concerning arms,ammunition  and implements of war the use of  which is prohibited in warfare.   It was ofopinion, however, that  the full value of these new texts would only  be obtained if the natureof the arms, ammunition and  implements in  question were stated.  The Committee  decidedthat it  was not  for it to specify them but that the matter should be left for the Commissionto discuss.    &apos;&apos;As regards Article ll1, one member has pointed out that its maintenance would greatlyfacilitate ratification of the Convention by certain producing countries which, in the  absenceof such a text, could not bind themselves unless all the principal producing States assumed thesame obligation.&quot; He thinks therefore that, if Article 11 were deleted,  this would  necessitate the insertion of a somewhat lengthy list in Article 18 and would thus  make the entry into forceof the Convention less  probable.     &quot;Lastly, as regards Article 18, the Committee did not consider itself competent  to draw upthe list of States whose ratification is  required.   It decided simply to lay before theCommission  the British proposal, according to  which  the  list  would  be  drawn  up  asfollows: &quot;Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia,  France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan,Netherlands, Russia, Spain, Sweden, United States of America.&quot;    1 &quot;The High Contracting Parties undertake to conclude no purchase contract for the supply of articlescovered by Categories I, II and III in a State which is not a Contracting Party to the present Convention.&quot;
    During the examination of this report by the plenary Commission,  the  Roumaniandelegate, supported by the Polish delegate, showed the necessity for including in the draftConvention to be drawn up an article similar to Article 29 of the Convention for the supervision of the International Trade in Arms and Ammunition and in Implements of War, of which the text is as follows :        &quot;The High Contracting Parties agree to accept reservations which  may be made by    Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Poland and Roumania at the moment of their signature of the    present Convention and which shall suspend in respect of these States, until the accession    of Russia to the present Convention, the application of Articles 6 and 9, as regards both    export to and  import into  these countries  by the  High Contracting Parties.   These    reservations shall not be interpreted as preventing the publication.of statistics in accord-    ance with the laws and regulations in effect within the territory of any High Contracting    Party.&quot;    After considering this  report, the plenary Commission unanimously declared that thequestion the study of which had been entrusted to it was too closely bound up with the questionof the limitation and reduction of armaments for it to be possible to arrive at once at a unani-mous text when no such text has yet been reached for a General Conference for the Limitationand Reduction of Armaments.   The Commission considers it its duty to report this situation to the Council and to propose that the studies already begun should be continued pari passuwith the  work of the  Preparatory Commission for  the Disarmament  Conference concerningthe general  Convention.    As regards the  fixing of a date for an international conference to be convened with theobject of concluding a draft Convention, the Commission could  not but note  the  above^-mentioned considerations relating to the connection between this question and the questionof the limitation and general reduction of armaments.

 z.   OBSERVATIONS  OF  THE  REPRESENTATIVE  OF   THE   NETHERLANDS.                                                          Geneva, March 17th, 1927.     With reference to the  resolution  adopted at the meeting on  March  14th last  by the Commission to draft a Convention on the Private Manufacture of Arms, the Netherlands repre- sentative on the Commission has the honour to transmit to the Chairman of the Drafting Committee appointed at that meeting the following observations on the preliminary draft Convention as set forth in document A.47.1926.   These observations  are  not exhaustive, and the Netherlands representative reserves the right to make others when the Preliminary draft is discussed by the Commission in plenary session. Article  3.     The Preamble of the preliminary draft declares that the manufacture of arms, etc., the use  of which  in war is  prohibited ought not to be permitted for such purpose.  It would perhaps be more in keeping with the spirit of this declaration, however, if the various articles of the Convention did not omit mention of the manufacture of prohibited arms not intended for use  in war.  If no supervision or publicity of  any kind is required in regard to prohibited arms, etc., the result might be to allow unlimited quantities of these articles to be manufactured. It would be desirable, therefore, to add in the first paragraph of Article 3, after the words &quot;of Category V&quot;,  the words &quot;or of the arms, ammunition and implements the use of which in war is prohibited by international law&quot;, and further to add a  new paragraph to the same article worded as follows : &quot;As regards arms, ammunition and implements the use of which in war  is prohibited  by  international law, authorisation shall  only be given in cases where it is established beyond  doubt that such articles are to be manufactured for purposes other than war.&quot; Article. 4.     The words &quot;who has advertised war material&quot; are not at all  precise;  it is uncertain whether they  cover tenders made by a firm verbally or by letter to a foreign Government. If they do, the prohibition laid down in the  second paragraph  of Article 4 would extend too far.  The Governments of non-producing countries would fail to obtain information as to new discoveries or new uses of material in other  countries, and a clause of this kind would thus unduly favour producing  countries.  Moreover, industries established in small countries would in practice be unable to find a sufficiently large market and would thus be handicapped as corn- pared with industries in larger countries.  In these circumstances, it  would seem preferable  to . omit in the second paragraph the words &quot;who has advertised war material covered by Cate- gories I, II and III or&quot; and  in consequence to substitute the words &quot;the categories mentioned in Article 1&quot; for &quot;Categories  IV and V&quot;. Article 5.     It would be more in keeping with the ideas underlying Article 5 not to limit the undertaking to the case of members  of a legislature but  to stipulate that no  contract may be concluded with a private firm one or  more of whose directors  or  managers are exercising political  or administrative functions  or are members of the legislature of that contracting party. In order to avoid any uncertainty  on this point, it would be desirable to add the words &quot;It is understood that this rule  shall not apply to commissioners or delegates appointed by a Government, to supervise a private or mixed  undertaking and sitting for that  purpose with the directors  or managers of  an undertaking&quot;. Article 7.     In  its discussion at the meeting on March 14th, the  Commission dealt chiefly with the desire expressed in various quarters that the scope of the draft Convention should be enlarged by abolishing  the restriction of its application to the national regulation of the manufacture of arms by private firms. The Netherlands representative  agrees with this suggestion, which would render the Convention applicable to State undertakings.     Should this view not be  taken by the Commission, the Netherlands representative proposes that the words &quot;as far as possible&quot; be deleted  from the last paragraph of Article 7 in order that publication relating to establishments of which the State is the sole  owner should not be left optional.     As regards the  second  paragraph of Article 7, it would seem desirable to define  more precisely the nature of return which is to be drawn up  by the High Contracting Parties byinserting after &quot;Article  1&quot;  the  words &quot;and  for  each separate licence-holder&quot;.  The words&quot;and as regards all articles  supplied, the names of the  Governments, institutions or persons to whom they have been supplied&quot; might also be  added  at the end of the first sentence. Article  9.     As, according to Article 3,  a licence  is required for the  manufacture of articles coveredby paragraph  1 of Category  V, and as Article 6 stipulates that all  licences must be published,it seems hardly logical to say in Article 9 that articles  covered by Category V shall only besubject to such publicity as  may be prescribed by the national legislation.  This rule should only apply to  articles covered by paragraph&quot;2 of Category V.   It would therefore be better to substitute the words &quot;the second paragraph of Category V&quot; for &quot;Category V&quot;.
Article 11:    While agreeing  with the intention underlying Article 11,  namely, that no  advantage should be given to States which are not parties to the Convention, we venture to ask whetherthis rule ought not to be applied  also to articles covered by Category IV.  Although it is truethat  this  category  includes,  inter  alia,  articles intended  for non-military purposes  a circumstance which would seem to make the proposed rule hardly applicable to this category- it should be remembered that in its present form the article would place non-participatingStates in  a privileged position as regards the  sale of aircraft, etc. Moreover, if the scope ofArticle 11 were enlarged, the various States would have a further inducement to ratify theConvention or adhere to it.Article 12.    In time of war, non-belligerent States might experience great difficulty in obtaining the arms, etc., they require. In all probability, some of the countries in which these States usuallyplace  their orders would be unable to execute them.  It would therefore seem hardly justifiable to make the rules of the Convention apply to neutrals in such circumstances and to allow the belligerents to recover full freedom of action. If the legitimate interests of neutral countries are to be consulted, it would be better to  draft Article 12  as follows :        &quot;In time of war, the application of the present Convention shall be suspended until    the restoration of peace as regards belligerents and also as regards neutrals whose supply    of arms is threatened as a  result of the hostilities&quot;.    A further question also  arises, namely, whether this suspension  should be limited  to atime of war or whether any time of crisis or of menace of war should be regarded as equivalentto a time of war.3.  OBSERVATIONS OF THE REPRESENTATIVE  OF JAPAN.                                                          Geneva, March 21st, 1927.                              I.   GENERAL  OBSERVATIONS.    1.   As the Japanese Government has already  had the honour  to state in its reply tothe Councils questionnaire,  arms and ammunition and implements of war are manufactured in japan chiefly by Government establishments, and only to a small extent by factories belongingto private undertakings.  Accordingly, industries concerned  with, the supply  of arms andammunition and. implements of war are very differently situated in  Japan  from  those ofcertain other countries where manufacture is mostly private.  In the case of Japan, previous experience has not been such as to raise  any serious objections to private manufacture as defined in the Covenant  of the League of Nations.  In these circumstances,  the  ImperialGovernment considers it expedient that the International Convention to be concluded shouldbe limited to a number of general principles and that each State should be left  to fix detailsitself.  In this way the future convention will not impose upon  the various contracting governments  any strict obligation to  frame special laws which might unnecessarily, hamperprivate manufacture.    2.   The Imperial  Government  also  desires to  state  that, in  its  opinion, the futureConvention on the Supervision of the Manufacture of Arms and Ammunition and of implements of War should be strictly limited to private manufacture as specified in the  title of the  draftConvention    which in this respect simply repeats the wording of the League. Covenant.In any case, the Convention should not apply to State manufacture the  supervision of whichis  fully guaranteed  by the  State  itself.   Moreover,  the supervision  of State  manufacturewould be bound to give rise to vary difficult problems which, far from contributing to thesuccess of the  Convention, might be the cause of its failure.                                II.  SPECIAL  REMARKS.Article 2.    Article 2 is open to certain objections which make it difficult for the Imperial Governmentto accept it in its present form.  Thus, if the dangers  of private  manufacture are due to thefact that it may be carried out without the supervision of the State and to some extent outsideits sphere of influence,  it would seem reasonable  to&apos;exclude from the future  Conventionmanufactures executed  in private  establishments at the orders of the Government  itself,which in this way exercises the necessary supervision.  With regard to Japan  at any rate,manufacture in a private establishment as the  result  of formal  orders from the competent
 Government authorities is carried out under strict Government supervision and may therefore be placed on exactly the same footing as State manufacture.  For these reasons, the Imperial Government has the honour to propose the following addition to Article 2 : &quot;Except manufac- tures executed on the order and behalf of the State&quot;. Article 3.     As regards the first paragraph of this  article, the Imperial Government considers that the phrase &quot;and paragraph 1 of Category V&quot; should be omitted, since the manufacture of ammu- nition  for arms  and implements of war is already subject to supervision by virtue of various sections of Categories I, II and III.  In this case-, the only substances concerned are powders and explosives which are of negligible  military importance or are only used for laboratory experiments.  In either case, there is  no real  advantage,  and there are certain undeniable drawbacks, in retaining the words in question at  the end of the first paragraph of Article  3, since in actual reality supervision would be very difficult in these cases.     Passing to the second paragraph of Article  3,  the Imperial Government assumes that this article  should be interpreted  in  the  sense that each High Contracting Party will be able to fix freely and as circumstances demand the duration of validity of each individual  licence. If this interpretation agrees with the intention of the authors of  the  draft Convention, the Imperial Government is satisfied ; if not,  it would like to modify the present wording. Article 4.     With  respect to the second paragraph of  this article, the Imperial Government would like some information as to the exact  meaning of the term &quot;commercial  propaganda&quot;.  If this expression is equivalent to &quot;commercial publicity&quot;, the Japanese Government has the honour to propose that the whole of  this paragraph be deleted,  as such a stipulation would  involve excessive interference with individual activity. Article 5.     The Imperial Government would like the whole of this article to be omitted, because in Japan there has  never been any reason to suspect the heads of private firms engaged in the manufacture of arms, ammunition and implements of war of abusing their position.   Moreover, as it is a question of fact, it is better to leave each Government to examine every particular case with  a full  knowledge of the circumstances.  Finally, in the opinion of the Imperial Government,  the question seems to fall rather within the internal administration of each State than within the  scope  of an  international convention.   Furthermore, the adoption  of this article might in certain cases give rise to difficulties in regard to modifications of fundamental national laws. Article  6.     The Government of Japan considers that part (c) of the first paragraph and the whole of paragraph 2 should be  omitted, as these two clauses are  very complicated and could hardly be  applied in practice  without violation of commercial secrecy    a  consequence which might  seriously injure perfectly legitimate commercial interests. Article  7.     The Imperial Government would like the last  paragraph of this article to be omitted, since it clearly lies outside the natural scope of a convention on private manufacture.Article 8.     The Government of Japan has the honour  to propose that the phrase &quot;on behalf of theState&quot; at the end of the fourth line of Article 8 be omitted, for the reasons already indicatedin regard to Article  2. Article  xx.     This article is not concerned with the control of private manufacture but with that of theinternational trade in arms,  ammunition  and  implements of  war.   It  does not  thereforecome within the  scope of the  present draft Convention and should consequently be deleted. Article  18.     In the opinion of the Imperial Government, the Convention ought not to come into force until after its ratification by the principal producing countries and after the ratification bythe same Powers of the Convention on the Snpervisiou of the Traffic in Arms,  Ammunition and Implements of War.  The Imperial  Government  considers this twofold ratification to benecessary on grounds both of  logic and of equity.
         4-   OBSERVATIONS  OF THE  REPRESENTATIVE OF BELGIUM.                                                            Geneva, March 29th, 1927.Article 2.    The definition of private manufacture given in Article 2 is open to no objection.   TheBelgian delegate, however, would recall the fact that his Government has already expressedthe wish that, as regards publicity, no distinction shall be  made between State manufacture and private manufacture.Article 4.                                                                            1    The efficacy of the ruling laid down in paragraph 1 is open to doubt.   The delegate doesnot see how it could be applied in his country without a profound and scarcely practicablechange in the organisation of companies and of the Press.   Further, the delegate considersthat it would be impossible  to prohibit all commercial propaganda in  regard to materialcovered by Categories I, II and III.  He is particularly doubtful as regards material coveredby  Category II.Article 11.    The delegate considers that the provisions of this article might be extended to Category IV.Article 13.    The delegate desires to make certain reservations as to the expediency of the last words:&quot;or of any other treaty, convention, agreement or engagement&quot;.    Finally, the delegate ventures to recall the following passage in the reply by the BelgianGovernment, dated July 26th, 1926, to the  Questionnaire of the Committee of the Council  :        &quot;Lastly, the Belgian Government considers that the regulations should be confined    to the immediate object in view,  namely, the control of the manufacture of arms  and    implements of war.  Accordingly, the proposed  Convention should  state clearly  and    unequivocally, leaving no possibility  of arbitrary interpretation, what is meant by the    term &apos;arms and  implements of war&apos;.  The Belgian Government thinks that it would be    desirable to revise the definition of June 17th,  1925, on the control of the traffic in arms&quot;.    5.   AMENDMENTS  PROPOSED BY  THE REPRESENTATIVE  OF  ITALY.                                                           Geneva, April 8th, 1927.                              I. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.    The Italian delegation declares that the draft should be confined to the supervision ofthe private manufacture of arms and ammunition  and of implements of war&apos;and not includeState manufacture.                                II.  SPECIAL REMARKS.Preamble.    The Italian delegation proposes the deletion  of  the first two  considerations and  theamendment of the third as follows :        &quot;Whereas, in accordance with the spirit of Article 8 of the  Covenant of the League    of Nations,  the private  manufacture of arms and ammunition and of implements of    war should be subjected to a general and  effective system of supervision and publicity&quot;.Article 2.    The Italian delegation proposes the addition of  the following words at the end of Article 2  :        &quot;And which are mainly or to a large  extent engaged in the  manufacture of the said    articles, excluding manufacture on the order and behalf of the State&quot;.Article 4.    The Italian  delegation proposes its deletion.Article 5.    The Italian delegation proposes  its deletion.Article 6.                                                 .    The Italian  delegation accepts the new text proposed by the British Government,  exceptin regard to the  last paragraph.
Article 7.    The Italian delegation accepts the new text proposed by the British Government.Article 81    The Italian delegation proposes the deletion of the words  &quot;or to be constructed&quot;  and&quot;on behalf of the State&quot;.Article 10.    The  Italian delegation proposes its deletion.Article 11.    The  Italian delegation proposes its deletion.Article 12.    The  Italian delegation proposes the deletion  of the words &quot;as regards  belligerents&quot;.6.  OBSERVATIONS  OF  THE  REPRESENTATIVE  OF  THE  UNITED  STATES.Geneva, April 20th, 1927.     Since  the purpose of the proposed  Convention is to supplement the provisions  of  theConvention concerning the Supervision of the International Trade in Arms and ammunition and Implements of War which was signed at Geneva on June 17th, 1925, and since the avowedpurpose  of the proposed Convention concerns the international aspect of the manufactureof such arms and  ammunition and implements of war as were considered in the Arms TrafficConvention, it is suggested that the Preamble of thedraft Convention be shortened and assume the  following form :         &quot;The following countries.   .    .   .   ....   .   .   .  .   .         &quot;Whereas it is desirable that the international aspect of the manufacture of arms     and ammunition and of implements of war should  receive early consideration by  the     different Governments :         &quot;Have decided to conclude a Convention and have accordingly appointed as their     plenipotentiaries      ........&quot;, etc.     In regard to  Article 1 of the  draft Convention, it is believed  that  the categories asappearing  in the Convention for the Supervision of the International Trade in Arms (documentA.16.1925.IX) should be embodied in the proposed draft Convention without change, for  thefollowing reasons  :         (a)  The proposed Convention is supplementary to the Arms Traffic Convention.         (6)  There  appears to  be  no  reason  for  any distinction  in  regard to publicity     of statistics as to  arms which are exported and those which are manufactured.     In regard to Article 2 of the proposed draft Convention, it is believed that this articleshould be deleted for the reason that it is unduly restrictive, and that any steps taken for thenational  supervision,  control or publicity of  the  manufacture of arms and ammunition andof implements of war would serve no useful end toward the maintenance of peace and allayinginternational fear of  aggression  or war if applicable solely to private manufacture.  Therepresentative of the United States is of the opinion that the whole field of production of arms,both Governmental and private,  must be submitted to the same degree of pitiless publicityif the avowed purposes of this Convention are to be attained.     The provisions of Article 3 of the draft Convention are not acceptable to the United states for the reason that the  Government of the United States is powerless to prescribe or enforce a prohibition upon private manufacture which takes place under the jurisdiction of the states which form the  Union  of the Government of the United States.  Federal authority in thisrespect extends only to the District of Columbia  and the Federal territories and possessions.While the Government  of the United States can  exercise supervision or control of inter-Statecommerce,  it has no authority over intra-State production.     Article 4 of the proposed draft Convention is unacceptable to the United States, not only for the reasons stated in the comments on Article 3 of the Draft Convention but also for thereason that the administration of Article 4 would appear to be almost impossible from apractical point of view.   It is obvious that the most elaborate investigational machinery wouldbe necessary to ascertain the connections, if any, of munitions manufacturers with the Press,and, even if this investigational machinery existed, it is not believed that its administration would serve any practical or  useful purpose.
    The provisions  of  Article 5, while plausible  on first sight,  are not  acceptable to theGovernment of the United States. The war materials included in the categories of the ArmsTraffic Convention are manufactured in many types of industrial plants, some of which, even under the broadest interpretation, could not be termed  munitions factories.  To endeavourto eliminate from consideration all manufacturing establishments capable of producing anyof the articles included in the categories and in which plants members of the Senate of theHouse of Representatives  might be directors  or  managers  would, from the standpoint ofthe Government of the United States, be both unwise and impracticable.    In regard to Article 6, the Government of the United States, while  opposing a licensing system, is well known as an exponent of the system of publicity for the manufacture  of armsand ammunition and implements  of war,  It would appear, however, that a more appropriatesystem of publicity is provided for in Article 7, as noted below, than in Article 6.  eliminating the idea of licences from Article 6, there remain merely the provisions that  the names, stylesand addresses of the proprietor or  proprietors, partners, managers or directors of munitionplants be published  and that the existence of all munitions contracts be made known along with the annual report  of each munitions manufacturer.   It is not perceived how the publi-cation  of this information would be of any great value to anyone save to the  competitorsof the  manufacturers in question.  It is believed that,  in so far as the trade of individualplants  with foreign  countries  is concerned, the Arms Traffic Convention provides adequatepublicity.  It would also appear that, in so far as production is concerned, similar provisions would provide adequate publicity for the purposes of the proposed Convention.    In regard to Article 7 of the proposed draft Convention, this article appears to be accep-table provided always that its provisions are extended to cover the production of government as well as privately owned factories for the production of arms and ammunition and implements of war.  It should be  noted,  however,  that  the quarterly  collection  and publication of statistics as provided for in this  article might involve  an unnecessary expense which wouldnot be justified by the object sought to be attained.   It is believed that an annual or a semi-annual publication of  these statistics would  be entirely adequate  for the  purposes of  theproposed Convention.    In regard to Article 8 of the draft  Convention, the  Government of the United States isdisposed to accept this  article and desires to call attention to the fact that the terms of thefirst paragraph are  all-inclusive  and  embrace  not only the ships manufactured in  privateyards but also those constructed in Government yards.    The provisions of Article 9 of the proposed Convention appear to be acceptable to  theGovernment of the United States.    In regard to Article 10 of the  draft Convention, the  Government of the United Statesfinds it  impossible to offer any comment or to accept the provisions until the Annex referredto therein is available for study.    In regard to Article 11 of the draft Convention, it appears that the object of this articleis  to force all countries to subscribe to the  proposed Convention.  It is believed that  theinclusion of this article in its present form in the proposed  Convention would  operate as astrong deterrent to  ratification on  the part  of many Governments  which  would probablydesire to preserve their full liberty of action in regard to the purchase of arms and ammunition and implements of war, if and ^when necessary, in accordance with  the demands placed upon those Governments  by their own national emergencies.    The provisions of Article 12 of the draft Convention appear to  be satisfactory,  providingthis article is interpreted in  accordance with the spirit of the corresponding article in  theConvention  for the  Supervision  of the Trade in  Arms and  Ammunition  and implements of War.    In regard to Article 13 of the draft Convention, it is believed that this article is somewhattoo loosely drafted and that phraseology similar to that  employed  in Article 34 of the ArmsTraffic Convention would be preferable.    The Government of the United States offers no  objection to or comment upon Articles14, 15, 16 and 17.    In regard to Article 18, it is believed that, in the actual drafting of this article, the names of important producing States should be introduced in paragraph 1 in order that ratification by those States should be a pre-requisite for the treaty coming into effect.

The  instruments  of  accession  shall  remain deposited in  the  archives of the Government of the French Republic.                          Article 12 (former Article 15).     The  present  Convention may  be denounced by any High  Contracting Party thereto after the expiration  of four years  from the date when it came into force in respect of that Party.  Denunciation  shall be effected by notification in writing addressed to the  Government of  the French Republic,  which  will forthwith transmit copies of such notification to the other Contracting Parties, informing, them of the date on which it was received.     A denunciation shall take effect one  year after the date of the receipt of the notification thereof  by the Government of the French Republic, and shall  operate only in respect of the notifying States.     Should the  Convention be  denounced  by  one  of the Powers whose ratification  is a condition of its entry  into force, any  other High  Contracting Party may also, within a period of one  year  from the date of such denunciation, denounce the Convention without  waiting for the expiration of the period of four years mentioned above, and may require that its denunciation shall take effect at  the same date as the first-mentioned denunciation.
