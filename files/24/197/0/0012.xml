i(THIS: DOCUMENT  IS  THE PROPERTY  OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT) C R E T..865  (38)                          CABINET.              -  WESTERN HIGHLANDS STEAMER SERVICES.             Memorandum by the Postmaster General.              In the course of the consideration of the proposals         made by the Select Committee of the House of Commons for the         maintenance of communications with the Western Highlands and         Islands of Scotland and of the procedure to be adopted for         procuring the necessary powers for the London, Midland &amp;         Scottish Railway to participate in the scheme, it has been         suggested that any Contract entered into with the         contemplated &quot;MacBrayne (1928) Company&quot; should be made by         the Post Office.              It is true that the MacBrayne contracts made since the         War have been made in the name of the Postmaster General and         have covered the maintenance of a certain standard of         communications as well as the conveyance of mails, part of         the Company&apos;s remuneration having been defrayed out of the         Scottish Office Vote in consideration of this.  The abortive         Contract went somewhat further in that it covered the         provision of new vessels and the reduction of freights, but         it was still arguable that the conveyance of the mails         remained the primary object of the Contract and accordingly         as a matter of convenience It was executed by the Post         Office.  The course of the Debate in the House of Commons,         which resulted in the reference of this Contract to a         Select Committee, and the Report of the Committee, however,         have emphasised the fact that the preponderating factor is         no longer the conveyance of mails but the maintenance of         adequate passenger and cargo communications with the
Islands in the interests of their economic development.  Thishas led me to consider the position further and, after takingthe advioe of the Solicitor to the Post Office, I am ofopinion that I have no statutory authority to enter into such a Contract as is suggested by the Select Committee.Unless, therefore, the Contract can be made by the Ministryof Transport under existing powers, it seems to be necessaryto meet the difficulty by  legislation.     I would add that, apart from the legal aspect of thecase, it would be neither convenient nor appropriate for thePost Office to enter into a Contract of the naturecontemplated, since any demands for modified or additionalservices would almost oertainly be based on passenger andcargo requirements and the cost of meeting them (which would fall upon the Government! could not properly be defrayed outof the Post&apos;Office Vote.  If. the Contract is made by another department the Post Office will use the services for the conveyance of mails and make a suitable payment to the contracting Department, on the lines followed in the oaseof the majority of overseas mail services.  At the outsetI suggest that the Post Office payment might be fixed at 21,500 per annum, that being the amount which would havebeen defrayed out of Post Office funds under the abortivecontract with Messrs. MacBrayne;  and this amount could bere considered at the end  of two or three years, if there is thenany material change in the volume of mails conveyed.                          (Intld.)  W. M-T.NEPAL POST OFFICE,  E.C.1.       31st July,  1928.
