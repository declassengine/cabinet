MEMORANDUM  BY THE  SECRETARY  OF STATE  FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS.    WITH reference  to  the Memorandum  on the  above  subject  circulated asCP. 285 (28), 1 circulate to my colleagues  a copy of a semi-official letter from theDepartment of External Affairs of the  Irish Free State regarding the proposed appointment  of Free State Ministers at Paris and Berlin, together with a copy ofthe letter td which it is the reply.                                                                   L. S.  A.    Dominions Office, Downing Street, S.W. 1,                October 8, 1928.                                          Department of External Affairs, Ref.  No. E.A. 3/1928.                                  Irish Free State, Dear Sir Harry Batterbee,                                    October 6, 1928.     IN Mr.  Murphy&apos;s absence on leave I have to thank you for your letter of the 29th September regarding the proposed appointment of Irish Ministers at Paris and Berlin.     We fully understood what had occurred in connection with the appointment of the Canadian Minister at Paris.  The Government here certainly wish to open the new Irish  Legations in the neai future, but so&apos; much importance is attached to the proposed change  in the wording of the note that we could riot allow our desire to expedite the  appointments to stand iri the way of a re-definition of  the status of the new Ministers.    We find it difficult to see what objection could be made to a proposal that the Irish Minister should deal  with all matters of Irish interest, and that, where  such matters  are  of  common  iriterest to  one  or  more  of  the  other States of  the Commonwealth,  consultation  with British and other  Dominion  representatives should take place prior to any action.    Under the Washington  formula the Irish Minister may be  prevented from dealing with the  Government to which he  is accredited  on matters of the highest importance to this Government.  This position we regard as untenable, and we feel sure that you will, upon giving the matter consideration, agree with Us.  I enclose a copy of the note which we will request you to have presented,  on our behalf, by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors to the Governments at Paris and Berlin, and we would like to have your observations at an early date.    We agree with your suggestion that  the Dominions should also be informed of our intention, and have sent a telegram to Canada, Australia and South Africa.   As His Majesty&apos;s Government in New Zealand retains the old system of  communication, we are asking you to: forward a copy to them.    In the  meantime we would be glad if you would cause His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors at Paris and  Berlin to approach the French and German Governments in the terms suggested in  your final paragraph,  omitting any reference,  in the  first  case, toMr. Mac White.                                                Yours sincerely,                                         (Signed)       JOHN E. LESTER.    Sir H. F. Batterbee.[18262]
Sir,    Under instructions from His Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, I have the honour to inform you that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the IrishFree State have come to the conclusion that it is desirable that the handling of mattersat  Paris relating  to the  Irish  Free  State  should be  confided  to an  EnvoyExtraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary accredited to the French Government.Such a Minister would be accredited by His Majesty the King to the President of theFrench  Republic, and he would be furnished with credentials  which would enable him to take charge of all  affairs relating to the Irish Free State.   He would be theordinary channel of communication with the French Government on these matters.    The arrangement proposed by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free  state would not denote any departure from the  principle of the diplomatic unity of theEmpire.  The Irish Minister would be at  all times in the closest touch  with HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador and with  His Majesty&apos;s  Canadian  Minister.  The  irish minister would not be subject to the control of His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, nor wouldHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador be responsible for the Irish Ministers actions.    In communicating to you these proposals,  which His Majesty&apos;s Governments inGreat Britain and in the  Irish Free State  trust will promote the maintenance anddevelopment of cordial relations between  the British Commonwealth of Nations andFrance, I have been instructed to express the hope that the French Government willconcur in the appointment of an Irish Free State Minister at Paris on the footing Ihave indicated above.  As regards questions such as the precedence to be attributed to the Irish Minister or any other points which the French Government may desire toraise in connection with  the appointment,  His Majesty&apos;s Government in  the  IrishFree State will await the views of the French Government.                                                   I have, &amp;c.                                     Dominions Office, Downing Street, S.W. 1,Dear Murphy,                                  September 29, 1928.     IN Harding&apos;s absence on leave, I am writing to thank you for your letter of the17th September as  to the proposed  appointment of Irish  Free State Ministers at paris and Berlin.  We have also received the official despatch mentioned  in thesecond paragraph of your letter.     We are not sure whether there has been some misunderstanding as to the positionin relation to the proposed Canadian Legation at Paris.   The situation  is thatMr.  Mackenzie King agreed that, with a view to the opening of the Legation at thebeginning of October, the wording used in the notification to be addressed to theFrench  Government should follow that employed in the case of the appointment ofthe Canadian Minister at Washington,  and that  consideration of  the question of possible modification of the wording at a later date should be left over.  Action hasbeen taken accordingly.   For convenience of reference, I enclose  a copy of the noteaddressed by Sir William Tyrrell to the French Government on the 28th August.     If it is the wish of  the Irish Free State Government that the necessary arrange-ments should be completed with a view to the Legations at Paris and Berlin beingopened  in the immediate future, we very much hope that they may  be able to agreeto a similar course being followed in these cases.  The question  of any substantial modification  of the Washington  formula would  require, of  course, very  carefulconsideration, and  there is, further, the question  of  the necessity  for reference toother Dominion Governments. &apos; In the circumstances, you will appreciate that, while we shall be ready, as always, to give the most careful consideration to the Free StateGovernments views, we cannot at present give any promise that it will be possible tomeet them.     We are not sure, however, from your letter whether the Free State Government,in fact, desire to open the Legations at once, or whether they are anxious  to be in aposition to announce immediately that the French and German  Governments haveagreed  in principle to the establishment of Free State Legations  in their  respectivecapitals.  As you say,  an announcement of this nature was made in respect of theCanadian Legation at  Paris  some months before the formal official  notification wasgiven to the French Government as to the proposed appointment.
    If this were the desire of the Free State Government, there would be no difficulty -in asking His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors at Paris and Berlin to approach the French.and  German Governments with  a view to ascertaining  whether  they  agreed inprinciple to the establishment of Irish Free State Legations, and, if so, whether they saw any objection to a public announcement to that effect.                                                  Yours sincerely,                                         (Signed)       H.  F. BATTERBEE.    S. Murphy, Esq.
CONFIDENTIAL.O.R  295 (28hDraft Circular Despatch  to His Majesty&apos;s  Representatives in the Capitals of all    Countries represented on the Preparatory Commission for  the  Disarmament    Conference.                             THE observations of the Governments of the United                          States, Italy  and  Japan on  the  British  and  French                          compromise proposals in the matter of the limitation of                          naval  armament  having now been  received,  the  present                          moment affords a convenient opportunity of presenting,                          for your information and guidance, an outline of recent                          discussions and correspondence on this subject.                             As a result of unauthorised and incomplete disclosures,                          the nature and scope of this compromise became, as you                          are aware, the object of public speculation, often of an                          erroneous  and  misleading  character.  His Majesty&apos;s                          Government are  contemplating  the early publication of                          papers, which,  in - covering as briefly as  possible the                          history of the negotiations for naval disarmament, should                          serve to place the matter in its true perspective.  That                          they have refrained hitherto  from publication has been                          due in part to their anxiety not to embarrass the  other                          Governments concerned by what might have been regarded                          as  an attempt  to force their  hand,  in part to  their                          reluctance  to  publish documents while still  incomplete,                          on  a matter at once complex in its technical aspect and                          far-reaching in its results.                             The Anglo-French compromise cannot be regarded as                          a detached or isolated event; it is the most recent link in                          a long chain of endeavour  to implement  the provisions                          embodied in Article 8 of the Covenant of the League of                          Nations to the effect that &apos;&apos; the members  of  the League                          recognise  that the maintenance of peace requires the                          reduction of  national  armaments  to  the lowest point                          consistent with national safety.&quot;   The first  steps taken                          by the League to  fulfil this obligation were turned in the                          direction of comprehensive schemes of  mutual assistance                          in  the belief  that the  creation of a   general sense of                          security was the  most promising avenue to an all-round                          reduction and limitation of armaments.                             In the face of continued failure to reach agreement                          on any such scheme, this line of approach was abandoned                          in favour of more direct methods, and. in December 1925                          the Assembly set up a special commission with mandate                          to prepare  the ground for a general conference.   On the                          completion of certain preliminary researches on technical                          matters  which  monopolised  its attention  during the                          ensuing year, this commission, known as the Preparatory                          Commission, attacked its main  task at its third session                          (March-April 1927), at which  the  British and  French                          representatives  each  put  forward  a  draft skeleton                          convention as a basis of discussion.[18265]
