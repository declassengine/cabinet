Copy No.   ^CP. 281 (28).CABINET.REPARATIONS  AND DEBTS.           Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    IN view of the discussions in regard to the revision of the Dawes settle-ment which have been taking place at Geneva and elsewhere, I attach,&quot; forthe information of my colleagues, a memorandum prepared by the Treasurysetting out the  main facts and considerations which affect the  question.    At present His Majesty&apos;s Government have no particular interest in pressing for any revision of the Dawes Plan.  We are at long last workingup  to the position in which  our debt payments to America will be fully:balanced by our reparation receipts from Germany plus  our debt receipts from our ex-Allies, and we have no inducement to support any  modificationunless it insures the continuance of this balance.    On the other hand, it is obvious that any fresh negotiations may placeHis Majesty&apos;s  Government in an embarrassing situation.   The Germans,in order to secure the evacuation of the Rhineland, will be anxious to concoctsome new plan.  The French, who have not yet ratified their debt agreements,either with America or with this country, will be no less anxious to devise a new scheme of reparations, hoping to make their debt payments contingent on its success.   Between them they are not unlikely to  fix up some proposal(with or  without the &quot;cognisance of America) which  suits their interestsbut not ours.  If we then refuse to accept the plan so prepared, the Press,both in Europe and America, will be  let loose on  us,  and  we  shall  be denounced as the sole obstacles to  the pacification of Europe.    It appears to me, therefore,  that His  Majesty&apos;s Government should adopt an extremely cautious and critical policy in regard to all proposalsfor the revision of the  existing Plan.   We  must  certainly avoid  theinitiative, or revision will at once be regarded as a  British interest, and weshall be expected to pay both our Allies  and our ex-enemies to  obtain their support for the  proposal.

CONFIDENTIAL.      PROPOSALS FOR THE  REVISION OF  THE  DA WES  PLAN.                   (MEMORANDUM PREPARED BY THE TREASURY.)     THE Dawes Plan has worked very successfully during the past four years, and those who seek to revise it ought to adduce very convincing grounds for their proposal. The Plan has given Europe a  respite  of four years from alarums and excursions,. during which period remarkable progress has been made with the financial restoration both of Germany and of the Allied countries.  From the British point of view, the Plan has enabled us to achieve, or nearly to achieve, the objective of the Balfour Note, viz., to cover our debt payments to America out of our receipts  from reparations and Allied  debts together.  We must  clearly see that any new  proposal that may be put forward gives us not less satisfactory results.    2.  The provisions of the Dawes Plan in regard to reparations may be recalled very summarily.  The Plan did not actually fix the capital sum to be paid by Germany, but provided a scale of annuities rising by steps to the full figure  of  125 millions per annum, which becomes due for the first time in the year from the 1st:September, 1928.  But  the  Dawes  Committee  were  not  content with limiting the  maximum payments to this scale :  they devised a further safeguard to prevent these annuities proving an excessive burden on the German exchange, by providing that Germany was responsible only for their payment in German currency.; The extent to which the payments in  marks could be transferred into allied curi-encies was to be decided by  a  Committee of Bankers, under the  Chairmanship of the Agent-General for Reparation  Payments, whose duty it was to restrict or suspend transfers if at any time such action might be necessary to maintain the stability of the Germau exchange. This so-called Transfer Safeguard was the keystone of the  Plan in  so far  as it gave foreign lenders a definite security against the risk that reparation Claims; might ever again upset the German Exchange, and thereby it provided a  basis ,for the restoration of German commercial credit.    Up to date all the annuities fixed in the Plan have been duly paid by Germany in German currency and have been transferred in full by the Transfer Committee to the Allied creditors.  It is true that it is still a matter of doubt how far this happy condition can be  regarded as permanent.  The Dawes Committee recognised  that in 1924 transfers could only be effected by means of foreign loans, and they recommended that the first annuity should be financed by a special international loan.  This was done, but, in fact, the German borrowing did not stop there, and still  continues. Altogether, Germany has borrowed abroad, since the inauguration of the Dawes Plan,, over  500 millions (mainly  in  America),  or nearly  double  the sums paid  as reparations during the same period.  Latterly, the bulk of this borrowing has taken the form of short-term loans attracted by the high money rates prevailing in Germany,. which is not a very reliable method of finance, and it is quite possible that, if, for any reason, these loans were  recalled,  a severe crisis might ensue in Germany and reparation transfers, in consequence, have to  be restricted.  But there is as yet no- immediate danger of such a situation  arising, and on present indications  there is every reason to believe that the full annuity should be capable of transfer for some time ahead.    3.  In the circumstances there is much  to be  said for leaving well alone andletting the Plan work itself out as the Dawes Committee had themselves contemplated. So long  as the annuities are being transferred in full, the Allied creditors have no reason to want any  alteration;  and so  long as no alteration is made, Germany hasno cause for complaint.  The initiation of fresh negotiations will at once let  loose ahost of acrimonious international controversies which have remained dormant during the  past four years, and it may not be easy to find  a new scheme  which will  restoreharmony again.    4.   The general question of a revision was first raised by Mr.  Parker Gilbert,the  Agent-General for Reparations, at the end of his published report of December 1927, when he suggested that the time for  a final settlement was not  far distant.  He repeated this view in his published report of June 1928, and he is understood to have pressed the  suggestion  still more definitely in unofficial discussions in Paris.  He-has adduced various arguments  in support of the proposal.  To the  Germans he has.      [181931        &apos;                                                B[This Document is the Property of His Britannic  Majesty&apos;s Goger-nment,]
recommended it on the grounds that Germany&apos;s credit cannot be fully restored until a, final settlement has been reached of her Reparation liabilities, and that, until this is done, Germany&apos;s sovereignty  will be impaired by the existence of the foreign controls instituted under the Dawes Plan.  On the Allied Governments he has urged that, so long as Germany enjoys the transfer protection provided  in the Plan, she has no inducement to maintain the strict Budget and credit policy necessary to ensure transfers,  and that a final settlement could.now be obtained under more favourable conditions than are likely to be possible in the future.  None of these arguments are entirely convincing.  The Transfer Committee and other Dawes organisations,  so far from being an engine of oppression, are a most valuable protection for Germany, andthe Germans fully realise this fact.  If a final settlement can be effected tb-day on more favourable terms than will be possible  later,  it must be assumed  that we can induce  Germany to abandon transfer protection for less than its true value not avery  probable contingency.   But  if, in fact,  Germany were voluntarily to accept aheavier  scale of reparation  payments than she would  have had to pay under theprotection of the  Transfer  Committee, the security for the Bonds to  be marketed under the  new  arrangement will  not be improved;  and the acceptance  by  germany of these obligations,  so far from improving her credit, may well tend to stop the flow of foreign borrowings which she needs and thus precipitate transfer difficulties.  Itcannot  be said  that the balance of argument  is at all strongly in favour of revision;and there is  a surmise that Mr. Parker Gilbert is perhaps influenced by his desireto get back as soon as possible to the United States with  the reputation of havingfinally settled reparations on a basis which enables the United States  Governmentto justify;the maintenance of their debt-collecting policy.    5.   It is true, of course, that the Dawes Plan does not itself constitute a final settlement of reparations, because it left  Germany5s total liability  unfixed  and  didnot even determine the number of years during which the annuities should  continue.But  this is a theoretical  rather than a real  difficulty.   The Dawes Plan  fixed themaximum annuities that Germany should pay in any year, and the present value of a payment spread over a large number of years is practically the same as  the value ofa perpetual annuity.  In any case, however, if this were the only difficulty, it couldbe simply  solved  by fixing  the period of the German  annuities  at 62  years (to correspond with the payments due to America  under the various Debt  FundingAgreements), leaving the Plan in other respects to work as it stands for the whole period,  or, at any  rate, until a change of view has occurred in America which wouldmake a  reduction of War  Debts  and a corresponding  alleviation of  Reparationspracticable.    But Mr. Parker Gilbert has indicated  clearly - that he contemplates a widerarrangement, which  would involve  Germany  giving up the Transfer protection andaccepting an absolute obligation to pay in  foreign currency a reduced amount.  Heis understood to have also encouraged the belief that if the Allied Governments makea reasonable  arrangement with Germany a  substantial block of German bonds mightbe marketed  in America and the proceeds  used to pay off  the inter-Allied debts to america at  a  discount.   But he has always  safeguarded  himself  against any suggestion that the United States Government would consent to any definite schemelinking  debts and  reparations.    6.   For  these ideas, Mr. Parker Gilbert has curiously enough succeeded  inobtaining the enthusiastic support of M.  Poincare.  The existing position is,  ofcourse,  entirely  satisfactory to France in so far  as she is at present  receiving asubstantial net  amount  (some  40 millions) of  Reparations  over  and above heraggregate debt payments to  Great Britain and to America.  But the debt payments to the United States will soon increase considerably, and there is no certainty that german reparations  will continue to be transferred in full for 62 years.   Further,the French Debt Agreements with America and with this country have not yet been ratified, nor is there any immediate expectation that the French Chamber will ratifythem  without a  provision making the French payments contingent on Reparations.M. Poincare is  therefore determined, if  possible, to substitute for the unratifiedAgreements some  new arrangement under which France could liquidate her debtobligations once and for all by a capitalisation of reparations.  But time presses.On the  1st August, 1929,  the French debt to  the United States of America for theSurplus  American War  Stocks bought by the French  Government, amounting to407 million  dollars  ( 84 millions),  falls due.   Under the unratified BerengerAgreement, this debt was to be funded, along with  the War Debt  proper, on very
 favourable terms; but if the Berenger Agreement is not,ratified, the whole of this debt must be paid: in cash, or France,will be in open default on a debt, which she has  always herself  classified as a  commercial debt.  Thus, though the  French Government will at the outset claim, that any final settlement should give to. France considerable payments from Germany over and above her aggregate debt obligations to the United States of America, and to this Country, it is not improbable that, as the maturity of the Stocks Debt approaches, they may be much more accommodating.     7.   The Plan which seems to have been discussed at Paris between Mr. Gilbert and M. Poincare  apparently is-     (a)  that  the  German Reparation Annuities  should be  reduced and  made an           unconditional liability without transfer protection;     (b)  that the Railway and Industrial Bonds  under the Dawes Plan (nominal           value  800 millions),  and possibly also further Bonds, should be  sold in           instalments over a term of years;     (c) that the United  States Government should (after a reparation settlement           and without formally linking, the two matters together) obtain power           from Congress to accept prepayment of the War Debt Annuities under a           substantial discount.     These three elements are closely connected in Mr. Gilbert&apos;s mind.  He considers that the Bonds could not be marketed without a reduction and final fixation of the Reparation liability; that the United  States Government would not make concessions about War Debts except after the Reparation liability has  been finally fixed; and that the United States Government would not accept a shortening of the period of payment to less than sixty-two years, while Germany would be unwilling that the Reparation annuities should continue for sixty-two years, so that  prepayment of the capital of the War Debts under discount is the only means of achieving a settlement, and this involves the marketing of the Bonds.    8.   The purport of the discussions between M. Poincare and Mr. Gilbert have been kept entirely secret, and the nature of the proposals which  they have in mind is to a large extent guesswork. , But it may at once be said that, if the Schemes are as outlined above, (a) they seem to be quite impracticable, and (b) they cannot be made to fit into the Balfour Note policy.    The scheme for&quot; commercialising &quot; the whole reparation Debt, or enough of it to pay off Allied War debts to America, is impracticable because of the magnitude of the sums involved.  The.present value of the whole of the Dawes Annuities is about  2,000 millions; and the present value of the War Debt Annuities due to the United. States Government, if the United States Government would accept prepayment under discount at 5 per cent,, is about  1,250 millions.      .           ., ,    This  1,250. millions would  have to be borrowed almost entirely in America, since  it is required for the repayment of Debt to the United  States Treasury.  The&apos; problem  would be facilitated if the United States Treasury would  accept Liberty Bonds and other United States Government Debt,  as well as cash, in repayment of the War Debts, so that part of the  1,250 millions could be obtained by conversion of Liberty  Bonds, &amp;c,  and thus not  involve  fresh  cash.    But  even so it.,seems- inconceivable that  the market could absorb a loan of anything like these dimensions.    Proposals  will  no doubt be  made that  a portion of  any loans raised for capitalising reparation should be  issued in London, but it will be  necessary to resist these proposals, because-    (1)  if sterling is borrowed, it will have to be converted into dollars to be paid to-           the United States,,.and an undue strain will be placed on the exchange;    (2)  the  amount which London has available to lend is  at present very limited,,           and reparation loans to Germany could only ,be made at the expense.of the          legitimate borrowing requirements of our home trade, our Dominions and          our  foreign customers; and          ,   ,              .  .      n\    (3)  the bulk of,any such loans would he,due to France, and France has already          more sterling balances under her control than is desirable.    The  difficulty cannot be overcome by planning  to issue, say,  1,200 millions intwelve instajnie,nts of $I0P -ifijilions. each,, :since.no. one ;will buy a security if he knowsthat the market is to  be flooded with a constant stream of similar securities with theresult that the price will tend to fall lower and lower.      [18193]&quot;                                                      B 2
    Thus in practice it would probably be found that the market could only absorba loan covering a small part of the amount required to pay off the American war debts, e,ff., a loan  for some  100 millions.    But there would be  no advantagewhatsoever in this kind of operation.  It may be worth while accepting some sacrificeto convert into a capital sum the whole Dawes Annuities of  125 millions, since wecannot be certain that we  shall continue to receive them in full; but it is clearly not worth while to accept a reduced capital sum instead of the first few million poundsdue annually, since these first few millions are not subject to any great risk.    Moreover, there are a number of technical  difficulties in the way of any  suchoperation.  For example : -    (a.)  The flotation of any Reparation Bonds would be conditional on the reduction           of the total Reparation Debt to a much smaller figure than has hitherto           been contemplated.   Probably  the market would consider  75 millions a           year an outside figure;    (b.)  Even so,  the service  of any  Bonds issued would have to be given priority           over all further Reparation payments (just as the D-awes loan had), and           their issue would correspondingly diminish the security for the remainder           of the current annuities;    (c.)  The Bonds  in their present form are quite  unsuited for marketing.   They           are denominated in German currency and carry no guarantee of payment           in  foreign  currencies; and  the. German Government would  have  to be           offered some inducement to remedy these defects;    (d.)  Furthermore, German Bonds, carrying, as these do, interest at 5 per cent.,           could  not be marketed at  par  and could  only be issued  at a  substantial           discount.   Even,  therefore,  if the operation were feasible, we should           have to pay a very heavy price  for eliminating future uncertainties.    9.  According to a Belgian report of the scheme, the loss involved  by the saleof 5  per cent. Bonds at a  discount is  to be avoided  by the  (presumably joint)guarantee of the  Bonds on the part of the British and French Governments.   this does not, of course, in any way reduce the  real loss, since the guarantor governments would be assuming  a contingent liability which may  be measured by the discountat which the Bonds would have to be issued if  there were no such guarantee.  Inother words, if a German 5 per cent. Bond could only be marketed at 83 per  cent.of its nominal value,  and a similar  Bond guaranteed by the French and british governments could be sold at par, it may be said that on each  100 Bond the Britishand French Governments  assume a  risk  which is equivalent (in the judgment ofthe market) to an immediate cash payment of, say,  17..  As the credit of the BritishGovernment is stronger than that of the  French Government, this  Country&apos;s  shareof the risk is more than half.    Further,  the contingent liability  would extend  to the  whole  of  the Bondsissued, while the  British Government  would only receive a part of the proceeds.Italy, Belgium, Serbia, &amp;c, would receive  the benefit  of the guarantee and contributenothing  towards  it; and this  would be inevitable in  any such arrangement,  since their  credit is not stronger than that of Germany.    The  guarantee would also  be  open  to  political disadvantages,  since  thereparation^  debt  would not  be converted into  a  purely  commercial  debt.   Theguarantor1 Governments  would  continue to be  directly affected  by the internalfinancial and economic administration of  Germany,  and might claim to  criticise orinterfere in Germany&apos;s internal affairs; while, if a  default occurred, the guarantorGovernments  would be the  losers, and  the possibility of their  desiring to  takecoercive  action, in the event of a default, would be no less than at present.   It is obviously out of  the  question for His  Majesty&apos;s  Government to  entertain anyproposal that it should give a guarantee  of this  kind.    10.   Even if the practical difficulty of  the market  absorbing  huge german reporation loans  could be overcome,  no solution along these lines could be arrivedat which would satisfy the conditions of  the Balfour Note unless the United StatesGovernment are prepared to make considerable concession on their part.    The operation would  involve (i) a reduction of the Annuity to an amount which both  the  German Government and the bankers  would regard as capable of  being paid  unconditionally  in  foreign  currencies  with no  risk of transfer  difficulties;and (ii) the capitalisation of the reduced  annuity on unfavourable terms.    The  result of this double reduction would probably be that the ReparationCreditors would receive less than half the amounts  which will come to them if the
 Dawes Plan continues to work smoothly, since the cash receipts  from the sale of Bonds  would probably be under   1,000 millions,  while the Present Value  of the Dawes Annuities  (assuming  no transfer difficulties)  is  about   2,000 millions. Accordingly,  the  receipts  which  would  be  realised  by  the  capitalisation  of reparations would be insufficient to  pay off the American  War  Debt  Annuities,. even if the United States Government obtained power from their Legislature to accept  prepayment at 5 per cent,  discount.   From illustrative  figures given in Appendix I, it will be  seen that the British receipts under such a scheme would probably  fall  short by  150 millions of our future payments to the United States, as well as leaving uncovered the deficit of  150 millions already accrued (exclusive of interest) for the past.     Some settlement  on  these lines  in the future might be  conceivable  if the United States  Government were to  allow prepayment of the debt annuities under a much higher rate of discount, since a comparatively  small cash  payment  to-day will satisfy a comparatively large debt due after a long period.  For example, at 8 per cent, discount,   90 millions paid to-day would  cancel all the War Debt Annuities due  after 1961, which amount to about  2,000 millions.   On paper, one- can work out a scheme by which  800 millions cash might be obtained from the sale of Reparation  Bonds and distributed to the Reparation creditors  in proportion to their War Debts to America and used to repay those Debts at 8 per cent. Discount. But any such scheme depends on (a)  marketing Bonds  for some  1,100 millions face value in America,  and (6) Congress agreeing to accept prepayment at 8 per cent. discount;  and it is clear that there is no present prospect  of either of these conditions- being fulfilled.     11.   Apart from the difficulties  of inducing the United  States to make any con- cessions, all proposals for capitalising reparations and applying the proceeds to the prepayment of the inter-allied debts to the United States  are peculiarly unfavourable to this country in so far as the terms of our debt settlement with  America involve much heavier liabilities  (in proportion to the amount of the debts) than the  settle- ments accorded by  the United States Government to our ex-Allies,  especially  in the first ten or fifteen years.  In fact, our debt settlement to the United States of America, however capitalised, represents always more than 50 per cent, of the aggregate debt liabilities  of all the Allied  Governments to the United States, whereas our share of reparations under  the  Spa Agreement  (excluding  the share  paid over  to the Dominions) is only 20  per  cent.   Thus our receipts from reparations, if capitalised, on the basis of any figures likely to be realised, could only be made to cover our debt liabilities  if the other Allied Governments could be induced to modify the Spa Agree- ment and  to distribute the proceeds of sale of German bonds in proportion to the respective inter-allied debts of the various Allied Powers.    12.  In short, any scheme for the capitalisation of debts and reparations couldnot  satisfy us  unless  (1)  the  United States of  America allow discount  at approximately  8 per cent.;  (2) the  Bonds  are  marketed in the United States  ofAmerica,  where the payments will finally be received; and (3) the proceeds of the bonds are pooled in proportion to Debts.    It is  most  unlikely  that  agreement will be  reached&apos; on any scheme  whichfulfils the  above conditions.  Indeed, the marketing of German Bonds is a delusionwhich, since 1920, has repeatedly excited the appetites of French Governments, andthere is little  more prospect of their expectations being realised  to-day than on previous occasions.  It is  very improbable  that  any permanent  settlement can bereached on such lines, and  it would be desirable,  if possible, to divert discussion into other channels.  Now it is possible to draw up a scheme which would give us all thatwe require under the Balfour Note by a completely different machinery.  The pro-posal is outlined in Appendix II and may be summarised as follows :     Germany  should offer to take  over the  charge for all  inter-allied war  debtpayments  to the United States of America in return for a cancellation of Reparationsto the European Allies.   Germany  would remain responsible for  the payment  of reparations to the United States, Japan and the Dominions (representing altogetherabout 5 per cent, of the  total Reparation Debt); and she would  have to pay the outstanding balance of Army costs to the United States, France and Great Britain (amounting to  56 millions) as well as the service of the Dawes Loan.  The Germanpajunents would be absolute and unconditional (i.e., the transfer safeguard would be-       [18193]                                                        B 3
abolished) and would be given priority over all other foreign obligations of the GermanGovernment except the Dawes Lpan.    Under this proposal Germany woulol  only  have to pay annuities  amountingto  55 millions in 1929, rising by degrees to a maximum of  89 millions in 1984, andaveraging about   75 millions  a  year,  as  against the normal  Dawes Annuity  of 125 millions;  so that she would have a very fair inducement to  give up the transferprotection.    13.   So long as Germany fulfilled these obligations His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould presumably be prepared, in accordance with the  Balfour Note, to&apos; waive thepayment to us of the Debt Annuities due by France and our other European Allies,though of course we should retain recourse against our Allies  in the event of any german  default.   So long, therefore, as Germany fulfilled her obligations,  france would not merely be covered for  her debt  payment  to America, but  she  would  be relieved of the Annuities due to us under the Caillaux Agreement. In the immediatefuture her receipts would be considerably less than what she has been getting duringthe past  four years, though they  would  on average be approximately  equivalent towhat she would be entitled to receive if the actual amount of German Reparationstransferred were limited to  75 millions a year.   Thus, it is not impossible that theFrench might be  induced to accept the proposal if they become sufficiently nervousabout the prospect of German payments continuing on the present scale, or if theirliability to meet the American debt for stocks is imminent.  It should  be possible to ease the  position further by providing  that Germany should pay France an extra 15 millions (or such other sum as might be agreed)  for the repurchase of the SaarMines, as contemplated in the Treaty. We  should, however, resist any proposal thatGermany should  be required to make additional Reparation payments  as tending to endanger the security for the  debt payments to  the  United  States of  America;but if it  is insisted upon, we must claim our full share of any such payments untilthe arrears due to us under the Balfour Note (some  150 millions plus interest) havebeen made good.    14.   The United States Government would, no doubt, dislike the arrangement aslinking together Reparations and  Debts, but it is not clear that they could justifiablyraise any objection provided that the legal  responsibility of the  Allied Governmentswas not affected.   Any future concessions about.inter-allied war debts made by theUnited States Government would, under this arrangement, directly benefit German^&apos;&quot;and the United States  Government are more likely to make concessions to  Germanythan they would to the  Allied Powers and particularly to Great  Britain.    As  part of such an  arrangement, the Allied Governments  would undertake towithdraw the armies of occupation and  abolish the Reparation  Commission and the dawes organisations, but their resumption  should be provided for, as a sanction, incase of any German default,  and this fact might be a means of pressure on the UnitedStates if Germany proved unable  to fulfil her obligations.    15.  A  scheme on the  above lines  would be satisfactory  to us,  but it is not desirable that we should  put forward any such proposal formally.  It may be hopedthat, by force  of circumstances,  something of this  kind may  be proposed by theGerman  Government if  other  plans fail (a  similar suggestion has  recently  beenventilated in the German  Press); but the chance of getting it through  would  be gravely  diminished if it came forward as a British proposal.    To  sum up :                                            -    (1.)  His Majesty&apos;s  Government has no  particular  interest in pressing for a          revision of the Dawes  Plan at the present time.    (2.)  We  should, therefore, not take  the initiative in  putting  forward any          proposal, as this would lay us open to immediate demands from the other          Governments  for concessions as a  condition of their acceptance of our          proposal.    (3.)  We should examine all schemes put up by other Governments most critically          and oppose them, unless they  fulfil  the conditions laid  down in the          Balfour Note.    (4.)  Any scheme for the mobilisation of  the  German debt  and  the prepayment          of  pur debt to America  can only  be  acceptable to  us if the American          market can absorb the German Bonds and  the proceeds of these Bonds          are pooled  in proportion to  the Allied Debts.  There is little prospect          of  these conditions  being accepted, and a final settlement on this basis          is scarcely likely to be realised.
(5.) The simplest method of realising the Balfour Note would be for Germany      to offer definitely to take over Inter-Allied Debt liabilities to&quot; the United      States of America in lieu of Reparations, but we should not volunteer      this or any other proposal.September 20, 1928.APPENDIX  I.    IN order to illustrate the effect of schemes to mobilise the Reparation Debt, it isnecessary to make a series of arbitrary assumptions and to  work out their results.The assumptions made in this Appendix are as follows :-     (a.)  That the annuity is reduced from  125 millions for an indefinite period to            75 millions for  36 years only.    (b.)  That 5 per cent, bonds to the nominal value of  1,158 millions are sold on           a  6^ per cent, basis on a  single date, the 1st January, 1930, and produce            965 millions cash, and that this cash is used on the same date to pre-pay           the War Debt annuities  under discount.    The interest (5 per cent.)  and  Sinking  Fund on these Bonds  would requireabout  70 millions, leaving   5 millions for the  service of  the 1924 Loan, &amp;c.   the creditor Governments would receive a capital  sum of  965 millions in cash.    2.  This would, under or on the analogy  of existing agreements, be distributed as follows :                                                                millions.To  U.S.A.

The present values of the War Debt Annuities on the basis of 5 per cent.and 8 per cent, discount, respectively, are as follows :           Debts to United States (at 4 - 86 dollars =  1) :-                                  5 per cent.      8 per cent.                                    millions.        millions.France       ...      ...       ...      404          253United Kingdom     ...       ...      687          460Italy        ...      ...       ...      105            59Belgium             ...       ...       45            29Minor Allies...       ...       ...       10   say      7                                       1,251           808Debts to United Kingdom :     France      ...      ...       ...     247           162    *Italy        ...      ...       ...      77            51    Minor Allies...      ...       ...      29    say      20353           233    4.  The following Table assumes that the Debtor Governments will be given an option, both by the United States Government and by His Majesty&apos;s Government, toprepay the  War Debt  Annuities at 5 per cent., or, alternatively, at 8 per cent.discount, and that this option will be exercised, and the Debt Annuities redeemedby a single cash payment on the 1st January, 1930. The &quot; Deficit &quot; in the last columnrepresents the cash which would be required for this  purpose  over and above the cash which would be received from the sale of the Bonds and the distribution of these* Taking War Debt Annuity at flat  4 millions a year.

APPENDIX II.   Outline) of Final Settlement of Reparations giving Effect to  the Balfour Note.     GERMANY should  offer, in lieu of  all further reparation payments to the European Allies, to take  over all the liabilities of France, Great Britain,  Belgium, Italy, Roumania, Jugo-Slavia and Greece on account of their war debts to the United States Government.          [The precise form of the arrangement would depend on whether the United     States Government agreed to  transfer  these liabilities  directly to Germany; if     they would not agree to this, the Allied Governments would remain formally     responsible to the United States Government, but the German Government would     undertake to put them  in funds before each payment  to the  United States     Government fell due.]     2.  The German obligation to make these war debt payments to the United States Government would be absolute and unconditional (i.e., there would be no transfer safeguard), and the payments would have the benefit of the first charge on German assets and revenues under Article 248 of the Treaty,  as against all other foreign obligations of Germany (except only the Dawes Loan).     3.  So long as the German payments were punctually made,  the British Govern- ment would renounce payment of the current annuities due  to Great Britain by her European Allies in respect of their war debts, but payment of these annuities would have to be resumed in the  event and to  the extent of any default by Germany.     4.  Germany  would be free to enter into any arrangement she can make with the United States Government for the mobilisation of German Bonds and for the prepayment of the Allied  Debts under discount,  provided that any such prepayment is applied to all the Allied War Debts without discrimination of any kind.     5.   The German Government would remain liable for :      (a.) The Service of the Dawes Loan ( 5 millions per annum);     (&amp;.) Outstanding arrears of Army costs due to the United States ( 43 millions),           France ( 7 millions) and Great  Britain ( 6 millions); and     (c.) Reparations  to United States  (2^ per cent.),  Japan (f per cent.)  and the           British Oversea Dominions  (approximately 3 per cent.).   (On the basis           of full Dawes Annuities, this liability might amount to  6 millions a year           or (say)  120 millions Capital value; but as the German payments to the           other Allied Powers are being reduced practically by  one-half,  the           German Government could  probably compound  with these Powers  on           a similar basis.)     6.   Germany should also undertake to  pay   15 millions (or such other sum as might  be agreed) to France  for the repurchase  of the Saar Mines;  thereupon theinternational administration  of the  Saar Area  by the League of Nations  to be terminated and German administration restored.     7.   The Allied Governments would agree to evacuate the Rhineland immediatelyafter the signature of an agreement on the above lines, and to terminate the Repara-tion  Commission and  the Dawes Organisations  (with the possible exception of theAllied Directors on the Reichsbank:)  within a period of one year.  If, however, atany time Germany should  fail to meet her obligations in respect of the Allied war debts to the United States  of America, the Allied Governments would have the rightto reoccupy the whole of the Rhineland and to reappoint the Reparation Commissionand the Agent-General for Reparation  Payments,  and the other officials providedfor in the Dawes Plan.  The German Government, moreover, would be required toagree that the Agent-General for Reparation Payments, if  so reappointed, shouldbe given&quot; definite powers of control over  the Budget of the Reich and of the GermanStates.o
