SESSION 1928-29,Note by the Parliamentary Secrstary to the                 T r e^sury,(Circulated with reference to Cabinet 44  (28),              Conclusion IT.          At the Prime minister&apos;s request,  I  circulate a memorandum on the Business of the House next  Session.                            B. EYRES MONSELL.12, Downing Street,. S-W.1,        25th September, 1928.
NOTES ON TEE BUSINESS OP TIED HOUSE, SESSION 1928-29,          A meeting of the House of Commons on Tuesday, 6th-,-,..November, after setting apart the usual number of sittingsfor the -     Debate on the Address     Supply     Christmas Adjom^nment Motion     Cont ingencieswould allow 15 sittings for Legislation before the adjournment on Wednesday, 19th December.This calculation is based, on the assumption that private members&apos; time would not operate until after Christmas.Whenever a new Session has been opened in the Autumn or theHouse of Commons has met at that time of the year to conclude the business of a session, the Government has taken the whole time of the House until the 51st December fortheir business.          Easter is early in 1929 (Sunday, March 51st) and assuming that the Commons reassembled on Tviesday, 5thFebruary, 1929, after allowing for -     Supply (Supplementary Estimates and          Money on Account)     Eastei&apos;1 Adjoui-nment Motion     Contingencies8-fs- sittings remain for Legislation.   In all the Governmentwould have 25-1- full sittings in the period from November toEaster in which to pass the Local Government and other Bills *&apos;ihe Government could take Private Members&quot; time for the wholeof the Session, which would mean the addition of 10 fullsitting days to Government time           If dissolution is to take place early in May,the Chief legislative measures of the Session willhave to be dealt with before Easter leaving onlj essentialfinancial and routine business-to be disposed of beforeProrogation.          The date of dissolution must depend upon thedespatch after Easter of the Budget and the Finance Bill;the Army and Air Force (Annual) Blllj  the Isle  of Man  (CustomBill and whatever Supply is deemed necessary -  even If  Itwere desired, not one of these items  (except Supply/)  couldbe proceeded with before Easter (the  Budget cannot beintroduced until after the end of the Financial  year;   andthe&quot; Army and Air Force (Annual) Bill  until just  before  the easter Recess;  the Isle of Man (Customs) Bill  is consequentlaupon the passing of the Finance Bill  and to alter the normalSupply procedure in Mar ah. either by increasing,  the total ofthe&apos;money to be taken on account for  the new financial  year or by taking votes on account for the Fighting  cervices(instead of a number of votes for each of these  services)would arouse criticism and suspicion), 6 or 5 4 1 iL1413 1 216
BUDGET.             The usual  recess at Easter from Thursday  to  the&apos;          following Tuesday  week is provided for  and unless  this          time were curtailed the first possible  day for  the          opening  of the Budget would be on Tuesday, 9th  April,          the remaining stages being taken as follows, -                   Report stage .............15th  to 17th  April.                   Finance Bill;                     2nd Reading ......, . . . .25th  Aprila                     Committee c............ 2nd  to 8th May.                     Report  o.... *. iiSth  and 14-th May.                     3rd Reading ............ 15th  May.                If new taxation is not imposed in the Budget the        Treasury think the above time table practicable,ly.              The public services must be provided for before        Parliament can be dissolved..        In March of every year a Civil Vote on Account; three or        four votes for each of the three Fighting Services and a        Gonsol.id.ated Fund Bill authorising the issue of the money        are passed, which sever expenditure for about 4-g- months        in the new financial year.                Assuming that it is considered undesirable to alter        the normal Supply procedure in March the courses open to the        Government in dealing with Supply before dissolution are        as follows -            L  Conclude the Business of Supply.             fi) by obtaining the 20 allotted Supply days, but                 this would probably -mean sitting until the                 middle of June and an election about July 10th; or            (ii) by reducing the number of allotted Supply Days                 from 20 to 10;            2.  Take nominal votes on account for the fighting        services,  and meet the new Parliament soon after the        election in order to complete Supply before the original        Votes on Account are exhausted in August..        The money taken for these services in March would        probably last until August but the power of vire-        ment peculiar to the fighting departments only        holds good until Parliament has completed the        grants for all the services.-   If dissolution        occurred before Supply could be completed Votes        on Account would therefore be necessary.    3r,   Take second Votes on Account for all services(Civil, Navy, Army and Air) to provide money until december and in this case Parliament would not necessarily meet untilthe Autumn when the remaining Supply would have to be obtained
           The number of allotted supply days was reduced in  1914-16  to 17;  1916 to 15;  1917-18 to 16, but war precedents  cannot be considered good examples frum a parliamentary point of view.          The reduction in the number of Supply Days or the adoption of either proposals suggested in (2 ) and (3) would,  in the absence of undue obstruction in the House of Commons, allow of a dissolution about the middle of May with an election early in June.   If the Finance Bill and Supply could be disposed of by Wednesday, 15th May and parliament prorogued and dissolved that evening,        Nomination day would be.........  Friday,  24th May.        Polling day would be    .........  Tuesday,  4th June in any event before Parliament could be dissolved anAppropriation Bill would have to be passed giving legislative effect to the Supply already granted,  namely, the Money on Account for 1929 and 1928 supplementary estimates.   Dissolution without the passing of anAppropriation Bill would be a constitutional irregularity.B.E.M.25th September,  1928.
