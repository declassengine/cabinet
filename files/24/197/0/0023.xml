 HIS DOCUMENT IS 2HE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 3 GOVERNMENT.CABINET.Recent Trend of Unemployment Figures.secret.Copy No&apos;jpmorandum by the Minister of labour.CP.     Up to the end of July, the movements of the unemploy-ment figures were unsatisfactory and disappointing.Usually, the figures tend to fall continuously during thefirst half of the year until towards the end of May,  andthe present year, up to the end of March, was no exception;up to that date prospects of further improvement continuedto be bright.   From April to July, however, the figuresincreased with unusual rapidity, and at the end of july the total number uf applicants for employment on the  liveregisters of Employment Exchanges etc.  in Great britain had risen to 1,305,000, or 278,000 higher than the figure for the corresponding date in 1927.   Some part of this increase - perhaps as much as 33,000 -  represented people who, owing to administrative changes,  are now includedamongst the unemployed but would not have been registered in the previous year, but the balance of nearly 250,000indicated a serious worsening of employment.   A substantial proportion of this increase was represented by coal,  wherethe summer decline of employment was much more intenseand widespread than usual.     The live register figures for August and the early part of September have been as follows:-30th July,13th August,20th August,27th August, 3rd September,10th September,17th September,1,305,0001,314,0001,308,0001,320,0001,325,0001,300,0001,293,700/It
     It will be seen that although there was an increase,on the whole, in the total up to the end of August, theincrease was relatively small, and that the latest figureavailable, relating to 17th September, shows an appreciablereduction as compared with the preceding weeks and is slightly below the figure for the end cf July,   In viewof the general tendency to slackness of employment InAugust, and of the greater activity which is ordinarily tobe expected in the autumn, it would not appear unreasonable to hope that the serious decline which was in progress inthe spring and early summer has been arrested and that some improvement may now be expected which will be reflected ina further reduction in the numbers unemployed.     It may be noted, in support of this view, that theproportion unemployed among workpeople insured in GreatBritain and Northern Ireland, which had -risen from 9.6 percent, in March and April to 11.7 per cent,  in July, showedno further increase up to the 20th of August, and that between 23rd July and 20th August there was some improve-ment in employment in the coal mining industry.   Althoughthe proportion wholly unenrployed in this industry was15.5 per cent,  at 20th August, compared with 15,4 per cent,at 23rd July, the proportion on temporary stoppages fellbetween tne two dates from 12.5 per cent,  to 10  per cent.,With the increased demand for coal which may be  expected in .the autumn,  continued improvement in the employmentposition in this industry may be looked for.     Some seasonal improvement in the clothing trades mayalro be expected.    Current market reports  suggest  animprovement in iron and steel and shipbuilding,  and lower                                                /octton
                     3.sotton prices may possibly help the cotton trade to recover a littlee   Against this the influence of theusual winter decline in employment in the building and    fconstructional trades will shortly begin to be felt,   any improvement in the general condition of employment in thenear future is likelye therefore, to bo spasmodic in character and uneven In its effects on different Industries,but the present position is distinctly less ^ satisfactorythan would have appeared likely at the beginning of Augusts     Attached is a Cable in which the course of the live register figures is shown since the end of Mar^h. 1928,with corresponding figures for the four previous years,Prior to the coal dispute in 1926 the trend of the figureswas favourable, and this Table illustrates the effeat ofthat dispute;  during a large part of 1927 industry andemployment were stimulated by arrears of work accumulatedduring the dispute and it was not until 1928 that theconsequences fully revealed themselves.
