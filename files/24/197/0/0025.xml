                    CABINET.                   CHURCH  SCHOOLS.MEMORANDUM BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION.           The  question of  Churoh  Schools  has  recently cone up  again in  a  form which should,  I  think, be  considered by the Cabinet.           In February,  1927,  I  circulated a memorandum to the Cabinet  (CP. 45/27) describing the course of the discussions  in regard  to an Enabling Bill and the temporary deadlock in which those discussions&apos; had. ended.   It seemed obvious  that these discussions  could not usefully be renewed  before  the Goneral Election.   This has been the view generally taken,  I think,  by responsible people in the Church of  England  and I understand that the Archbishopls Commission on  Religious Teaching do  not contemplate issuing a report  until  after tho Election.          Unfortunately, this view  is not shared by some of the bishops and leading clergy  of the Roman Catholic Church. The problem of  Roman Catholic schools has throughout offered more difficulty than that of Anglican schools. The  Catholic Education Council who,  under the Bishops, represent the  Church in this matter, have never accepted the  idea  of an Enabling Bill, because they believe that certain  local education authorities, in whose areas Roman Catholic  schools are particularly strong,  notably Manchester,would, refuse to make use of the powers conferred by suoh  a Bill.   They have therefore insisted on the  necessity of  anational  settlement,  arrived at by national  negotiations.                                                ,nM,j. - -         CI(THIS  DOGIMBNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS G0V3BRNMENT) , SEC RET- CP.  276  (28).                                      COPY NO.
 When the  Cabinet  authorised me  to  pursue  a  certain  line  of policy in regard  to  an  Enabling Bill,  it  was  on  the  distinct understanding that the  Government  should  not  be  placed in the  position of negotiating terms  directly  with  any  national religious body and I have  therefore  avoided anything but the  most  Informal discussions with the  Catholic  Education Council or the Catholie Hierarchy, but  it is  becoming increasingly difficult  to  maintain this position.    The Hierarchy has issued a  Declaration on the subject, a copy of which  will be  found  in  the appendix, and they have gone so far  as to recommend  this  declaration to  the considera- tion of Catholics in connection with the  coming  election. The  Catholic Education  Council  has,  I believe, drafted a Bill which would  raise  in  its most acute  and  dangerous form the  whole question of Government grants in  aid of the building  of  Church schools.   They have not yet  communicated this  Bill to  me,  nor indeed, have they yet approached me formally  on  the subject of an amendment of  the present law; but  they  are  being pressed to do so by some of their members and  by  some  of the Bishops, who, moreover, wish, if my answer  is unfavourable, to undertake negotiations with the other political parties.   It is therefore too much to hope that the  question can be entirely shelved until next summer.          On merits,  there is a strong case for some amendment of the present law.    To take only the most  obvious anomaly,we are at  present engaged in a comprehensive reorganisation of elementary schools into junior and senior schools. This is not only an  educational improvement  but also inmany areas a considerable economy,  the saving  in staff morethan counter-balancing the loan  charges on new buildings.But  in the case of voluntary schools  under the existing
 law,  the  loan  charges  fall  on  the voluntary body while the economy in  staffing accrues  to  the  local authority.   The local authority  can neither  assist  voluntary bodies  in reorganising their schools nor  require them to spend money themselves for that purpose.          To meet this  and  other difficulties, I have long had in mind a  twofold  amendment of  the present law.   In the first place, an Enabling Bill would give local authorities general powers of assisting voluntary bodies to bring their elementary schools up-to-date.   In the second place,  I  contemplate  a more  fundamental change. The existing restrictions in regard to religious teaching and grants  of  public money in aid of denominational schools apply  only to  elementary, and not to higher, education.   The existing line  of demarcation between &quot;elementary&quot; and &quot;higher&quot; education is an artificial one and corresponds  less axid less to real distinctions between different types of school.   The tendency nowadays is to regard  all  education from the age of about eleven as &quot;secondary&quot;, and it would be natural to define &quot;higher&quot; education, which already includes the schools now known as secondary schools,  as covering all education after that age,  so long,-  at any rate, as it satisfies certain minimum conditions.    An amendment of the law embodying such  a  definition would probably be positively popular on its own merits, and it would automatically remove the disabilities of voluntary schools,  so far as concerns education for  the last three years or so of compulsory^ school  life.   Opposition to these proposals would be the less  likely if they were put forward as part of a general revision of the Education Act,  many of whose provisions are becoming increasingly out of date.    I am now working
                                                         1 ^ t) on proposals for  such a revision, which I hope to put--before&apos; the  Cabinet in  due  course.           legislation on these  lines, however, while  it would  in fact give  great relief to voluntary schools  and would  bo welcomed by all those, both  Roman Catholic and Anglican,  who have  real knowledge of  educational problems, would  not  at first  sight be popular with Roman Catholics generally.   As I have said, they are not attracted by the idea of local option under an Enabling Bill, and at the present moment  they are oven less attracted by the idea of re-organisation into junior and senior schools.   Here we come to the special difficulty  of the Roman Catholic problem.   The  Roman Catholics  aro the only voluntary body who  are building  new schools.   The first ambition of every  priest of a newly formed  Roman  Catholic parish  is to have his own parish school, however small it may be and however impossible  it may be to provide proper education for the  older  children in so small  a school.   This tendency is generally supported by the hierarchy and bitterly opposed by the Local Authorities, since nothing is so expensive  as the  staffing of small schools.   The parish priests, and to a large extent  their flocks,  dislike any re-organisation which involves  the removal of the older children from one parish school to another.   This opposition will eventually die  down, for many Roman Catholic parents  are probably already beginning to.be impressed by the  improved education given to the older children in the re-organised&apos;Council Schools.   But, for the moment, the announcement in an election programme of a proposed amendment of the law based upon the two principles of local option and re-organisation would not concilitate Roman  Catholic opinion,  which,  in its present temper,would be content with nothing less than a direct repeal
 of the  clause  In the  Education  Act which  forbids parliamentary  Grants  in  aid  of  the building  of denominational schools.           It is needless  to  add that,  if  a programme ox this kind  would not conciliate  Roman Catholics, it might seriously  alarm Proe  Churchmen.   The  latter hare already practically accepted  the  idea of an Enabling Bill and they would,  I believe, be  quite ready to- acquiesce in a general revision of the law,  including  a re-definition of &quot;elementary&quot; and &quot;higher&quot; education which would be educationally  sound and would. Incidentally turn the flank of the  1S02 settlement;  but it  would  be  a very different thing to ask them to  acquiesce  in this policy if it were put forward as  a frontal, attack  on that settlement.   A general revision of the Education Act  probably could not, for various reasons,  be undertaken before the parliamentary session of .1931,  and  all arguments seem to be against its inclusion  in an e3.oction programme.           In these circumstances, our  only possible coursewould appear to  bo to endeavour  to persuade  the most influential members of the Catholic Education Council and the hierarchy to  take the same viow as has been taken by leaders of the  Church of England:  that whatever may be the prospects  of a new settlement of the denominational schools question, those  prospects could  only be prejudiced by discussion in the atmosphere of  a general election.   The task of persuasion will not he easy but it is not,  I think, impossible, especially if we can give some earnest  of our good intentions  by one or two minor and not very expensive concessions to voluntary schools within our present powers which I may he able to propose to the Chancellor of the
u      Exchequer, but to which I do not, of  course, ask him  to      commit himself at the present moment.   But this line  of      action will involve- some measure  of direct discussion      with the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church  and      while I do not ask the Cabinet at this  stage to take  any      new decision on the subject, I wish them  to be fully-      informed of the situation which   has arisen.                                      x? pBoard of Education.   26th September, 1928c
                       A P P S N.....D I X.        DECLARATION  0?  THE HIERARCHY ON  EDUCATION.     The Bishops at their Annus 1 Meeting had again underreview the present situation of the non-provided schools.They affirmed once mere their  conviction that the actual con-ditions were In no way contemplated when the compromise of 1902was arrived at;  and that these conditions now constitute a burden which is beyond the strength of the supporters of thoseschools to bear.     They desire to emphasise  two principles which are essential to a just and lasting settlement of this urgentquestion.     (1) That to all parents there should be open some liberty of choice of school such as at present belongs in most casesonly to the wealthier  classes;  and that liberty of  this kind is possible only if the system of voluntary schools,, whetherprimary or  secondary,  be maintained and extended.    Any weakening of the voluntary system means  inevitably a  further lessening,in the case of poorer  parents, of the  very  limited freedom of choice of school which they still possess.      (2) That  precisely the same facilities of education shouldbe given to those  who  regard definite  religious  teaching as anessential part  of  education, as  to those who attach  no such-importance  to  teaching of that character.     We claim,  therefore, a reasonable  choice of school__forparents of  every social  class, and equal edu cat ion a. 1 facilitiesfor all, unhampered by disabilities on the  ground of religion.
