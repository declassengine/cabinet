COTSEUMENX,                    ^CP. 265 (28).               ;    .    _                 ft&quot;&quot;*                                CABINET.             COMPENSATION IM THE CASE OF  OSCAR SLATER *        MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND.1.     Oscar Slater was  convicted of murder and sentenced to death    at the High Court  of Justiciary, Edinburgh, on the 6th May.    X909.    The sentence was  commuted to Penal Servitude for life.    He was liberated on  licence on the 14th November, 1927, having    then completed 184- yearsT  imprisonment.   At the present date    he is  56  years old,2.     Since 1909  it has. from time to time, been represented, on    various grounds, thai Slater ought to be liberated.   In    particular numerous  representations were made in 1927, alleging    that new evidence  was available which established his innocence.    In view of these representations the Criminal Appeal (Scotland)    Act, 1927, was passed in  order to enable an appeal to bf hoard    and determined by  the High Court of Justiciary in accordance    with the provisions  of the Criminal Appeal (Scotland) Act, 1926.3.     This appeal has now been heard by the High Court, and on    the 20th instant the Court quashed Slater1 s conviction and    sentence.   In their opinion the Court are unable to hold that    the verdict of the jury at the trial was either unreasonable or    unsupported by evidence:   and the Court further finds that no    new evidence of any  materiality and relevancy has been submitted.    The conviction and&quot; sentence are quashed on the sole ground that    the judge at the trial failed to direct the jury to put out of    their minds evidence regarding SlaterTs disreputable relations    with the female members of-his household.4.     The question of compensation to Slater has been discussed    between representatives of the Home Office, Treasury and    Scottish Office,, and on a consideration of precedents, the    principles applicable in  such cases, and the circumstances of    the Slater case, it  was agreed that the payment, ex gratia, of    a lump sum of   5,000 would be appropriate, this payment to be    regarded as covering all  claims^by Slater, whether in respect    of expenses or otherwise.    5,000 was however the amount paid    in the Adolph  Beck case,  where the period of imprisonment after    wrongful conviction  was only about Si years..   Though the    circumstances  of the Slater case are different, it may on this    account bt* considered desirable to pay Slater rather more than    was paid to Beck.    If this view is taken, it is suggested that    an ex gratia payment of  6,000 should be.made to Slater.    Unless,  however&quot;, my  colleagues feel that  6 009 would be    preferable,  I  should be glad to have authority to pay  5,000    as compensation.                                    1JOHN GILMOUh&apos;oScottish Office.     31st July, 1928.
