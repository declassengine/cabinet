CABINET.BRITISH POLICY IN THE PERSIAN GULF.              MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.     THE major questions  which will  call for consideration by the Persian  Sub-Committee are contained in the Memorandum circulated as P.G. 3.  At one stage orother a decision as to the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government on all the pointstherein referred to will probably be necessary.   In the present Memorandum Ipropose, however, to address myself solely  to  two main  questions of policy thegeneral attitude to be adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government vis-d-vis Persia in theforthcoming negotiations on the British position in the Persian Gulf, and the broadlines of the arrangements in the Gulf at which we must aim if the maintenance ofBritish supremacy is to be secured.     I will preface my observations by the remark that careful consideration duringthe past three months of the question of British policy in the Persian  Gulf, taken with the situation which has gradually developed in the Gulf since the last meetingof this Sub-Committee on the 26th July, has  deepened the conviction towards whichI have long been advancing, that the present juncture is one of critical  importance;that a false step now will  be retrieved  later with the greatest difficulty,  if at all;and that failure on the part of His Majesty&apos;s  Government to take up  the Persianchallenge, and to adopt a strong line  in dealing with that challenge, will havereactions the unfortunate effect of which will not be confined to our position in Persia,in Iraq, or in the Gulf, but will tell adversely on us throughout the East.     My colleagues are familiar with the  previous history of  the situation  in theGulf, and no detailed reference to  it is necessary.  But I feel that before passing toexamine the major issues of policy to which I  have referred above,  their attention should again be  drawn to the series of incidents which have marked the summer ofthis year the reassertion of the Persian claim to Tamb and Abu Musa;  the Persianaggression at Basidu;  the Persian attitude at Henjam;  the vigorous renewal of thePersian claim to Bahrein; the advancement of  a claim,  so fantastic as to be almostunbelievable, to. suzerainty, if  not to dominion, over Muscat and the independentArab States of the Arabian littoral of the Gulf; the indications,  following on theextrusion of His Majesty&apos;s Government from the control  of Quarantine, of a Persiandisposition to challenge the continued discharge by His Majesty&apos;s Government  ofthose other humanitarian and international obligations  (lighting  and buoying;  the suppression of the traffic in slaves,, and of the  trade in arms), which,  owing to aPersian impotence no less marked now than in the past, have hitherto been discharged by them; the Persian attitude on the question of the Air route; and the conduct ofthe Persian Government towards  Iraq.  A record of this character, and  of  thesedimensions, leaves, in my judgment, no room for reasonable doubt that Persia hasdefinitely thrown down the glove, and that she  intends to leave no effort unstrainedto secure the total elimination of the former influence of Great Britain, not merelyfrom, the South Persian shore, and from those islands the  Persian ownership of whichis not in disoute, but from the Gulf as a whole.       [18284]                                                         B
     That the maintenance in the Gulf of British supremacy is essential for Imperialreasons I am myself disposed to regard as axiomatic, and while I have not yet hadthe advantage of seeing  the views expressed on  the point by  the  Chiefs  of  StaffSub-Committee, I am  fortified in that  impression by the views  of the Governmentof India, which were circulated to the Committee in P.G. 9, and of the Indian GeneralStaff.  The definition of supremacy is a matter  which likewise has been referred tothe Chiefs  of  Staff Committee, and  on which  we await their  considered  opinion.For the purpose of the present  Memorandum, I am prepared to base myself on thegeneral proposition outlined by the Government.of India in their telegram of the23rd  July, that  it   may  be  regarded  as  the  exclusion  from  the   gulf of  a  foreign  naval  base or  fortified  port;   the  prevention, equally,  of theestablishment of a foreign military air base within  striking distance of our  Gulfcommunications; and  the maintenance of the  status quo on the Arab  littoral ofthe Gulf.     On the assumption, then, that the maintenance of British supremacy is of vitalimportance,  and (subject  to the expert opinion  which we await  from  the Chiefs ofStaff) that it may be defined for present purposes in the terms I  have suggested, thequestion which next calls for consideration is the weight to be attached to the presentCentral  Government in Persia;  the extent to  which  it can be regarded  as  in aposition to control the Gulf area;  the importance to be  attached to a challenge by itto our special position in that area;  and the reliance  which can be placed on anyengagement into which  it may  enter regarding that area with  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.     As I have already indicated in  this Committee, I am myself disposed to feelgrave doubts as to the desirability of  treating with the  present Central Governmentin Persia as a civilised Government exercising effective power over  the whole of persia and entitled to rely on a substantial  duration of that power; and, were thematerial there to build on, I am not sure that I should not have been inclined even now to welcome a reversion to the system of regional agreements with the local Chiefsof  the  Gulf area  on  the basis of which  our  present supremacy  was  so largelyestablished.  But the close examination of this question  which,  at my request, hasrecently been undertaken by the  Government of India and  the Political Resident,the results of which will,  I hope, shortly be available to members of this Committee,goes to show that this line of policy  could hardly be adopted now with advantage.I cannot resist the unanimity of  expert opinion on this question.;  and, though not without anxiety, I am prepared,  therefore, to recognise that, despite  the numerousand serious factors which justify suspicion alike of its capacity and of its bona fides,&quot;we must pin our faith to the Central Government,   But I would  emphasise thatthe existence of  those factors, and the obscurity of the future, constitute  weightyarguments against the making of concessions at  the present time to that Governmenton any point which would prejudicially affect our supremacy as  defined above.     To turn now to consideration of the attitude to be  adopted  in dealing with theCentral Government and  the ends at which we should aim in the interests of main-taining supremacy as denned above.     After careful consideration of the position of His Majesty&apos;s  Government onthe Persian littoral of the Gulf, I am disposed  to the view that, in  present circum-stances, we can hardly maintain any special position or privileges in  the face of a vigorous attack, such as there is  reason to anticipate, by  a Central Government whichwe are obliged to regard as speaking authoritatively cn behalf of Persia as a whole.I do not propose to examine that position in detail, or, indeed, to  do more than brieflyto indicate,  for the consideration of my colleagues, the conclusion at  which I havemyself arrived.  That conclusion is that on the assumptions that the special british position on the Persian littoral is untenable in face of a determined Persian challenge;that beyond the Duzdap Railway  and a compromise on the question of her debt, wehave little of substance to offer Persia in return for concessions at Hen jam or inrespect of other special privileges; that it is in any event essential to secure the with-drawal of her pretensions to Bahrein and the Arab Coast;  that a compromise in theSouth Persian area purchased by  admission of those pretensions  would be unaccept-able:; then that the maintenance,of the general position of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the Gulf area, and the securing of the degree&apos;of British supremacy in that area which I suggest must be regarded as essential, can be attained only by the consolida-tion of the position at present enjoyed by His  Majesty&apos;s Government on the Arablittoral and in the Islands of the Gulf.  The detailed methods by which that positioncan be consolidated I will not  now  examine, nor would  a  detailed exposition be
                                                                                     9 -? 9                                        3 appropriate in a memorandum, the object of which is to adumbrate a general policy in general terms. But it is necessary to a full appreciation of a point which I develop in the following paragraph that I should explain that it involves the repudiation of Persian claims to Bahrein;  to suzerainty over any portion of the Arab littoral; to those islands in the Gulf itself (such as Tamb and Abu Musa), which His Majesty&apos;s Government have in the past recognised as belonging to the Trucial Arabs;  and of  any  claim  by  Persia to  islands  the  status  of  which  has  either never been  determined, or is in dispute between Persia and  our Arab  protectorates. His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  should,  in addition, in  my judgment,  be  prepared to consider whether they should not also repudiate the right of Persia to interfere in the administrative control of the Gulf within areas which  can reasonably be regarded as Arab territorial waters (or, indeed, possibly international), justification for such action being afforded by  the  present impotence of Persia adequately to discharge the  international obligations involved outside Persian territorial waters.     The adoption of a policy such as I have outlined above would clearly involve the taking of the  diplomatic offensive  against Persia.  I  do not ignore the arguments which can be adduced against such a course;  and I recognise  that the final statement and  balancing of arguments  must await the  result  of  close examination of the problem  as  a  whole in this Committee.   But,  on  the assumption that  the  more * substantial reasons which can be alleged against the adoption of such a course are, in the first place, the international difficulty and suspicion  to which it might  give rise, more especially if coupled with a  Persian appeal  to the League,  and-an argument on a different plane: the danger that it might result in interference with the  Anglo-Persian  Oil  Company,  and   so  with   the  oil  supplies  of  the fleet,   I   am   not   disposed   to   attach   overdue  weight to   either,   and  at a  later  stage  in  this  memorandum  I have  indicated  the  reasons  on  which this attitude is based.  On the other hand,  the maintenance of a  merely  defensive attitude in the face of  Persian encroachments  is likely, in my judgment,  to result in a continuance of the  process of attrition at the expense of British interests which has already been carried so far by Persia, coupled with a gradual lowering of British prestige on the Arab littoral, until  His Majesty&apos;s Government will find it extremely difficult to consolidate, or to regain, their position in that area (which has achieved a fresh Imperial importance in connection with the Air  Route), without the  adoption of a policy which will attract international  attention  to an  undesirable degree. It is not irrelevant to  remark, in this  connection,  that our abandonment of the Sheikh of Mohammerah (inevitable though  it may have been) has done us great injury in the Gulf;  and that the adverse effect on our prestige which would result from yielding in the least degree to Persian pretensions in the case of Bahrein (the Sheikhs of which already entertain doubts as to the bona fides of  His Majesty&apos;s Government),  or of the Trucial Sheikhdoms would be incalculable.    At the  present stage His Majesty&apos;s. Government can hold,  or develop,  the advantages  they  possess;  to  endeavour to regain them, once they have passed, or have begun to pass, from us would be a much more difficult task, and I would therefore invite  the earnest attention of my colleagues to  the desirability of adopting an  attitude  of  active  opposition to Persian claims elsewhere than on the South Persian coast and in Persian territorial waters, and to the employment, as  the best means to secure our interests in the Gulf against the attack which has been directed upon them by Persia, of a vigorous counter-offensive.     The  importance which, in my judgment, attaches to the adoption in the forth- coming negotiations of  a policy such as I have outlined above,  and the  extent to which the position  of the Anglo-Persian Oil   Company  and the  existence of the League of Nations have, in earlier discussions  of  this  subject, underlain the reluctance to adopt  a strong line in dealing with Persia, point to the desirability, before concluding this memorandum, of  indicating briefly the reasons for  which I am disposed to attach only a qualified importance to those arguments in the present connection.     In the first place, before examining either argument in  greater detail,  I would hazard the general proposition that  these are difficulties which must be faced at some stage  in our relations with Persia, and that they can better be faced now than later. Once Persia realises-and to some extent she has already begun to realise that our anxiety as to  the position of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and our anxiety to stand well in the eyes of the League are points on which she can apply pressure in her dealings with us, she may be relied on to blackmail us through them.  And the process, in my judgment, unless we are prepared to  face  her on both points, is-unlikely to cease with the stripping of such advantages  as His Majesty&apos;s Government       [18284]                                                       B  2
may have acquired without legal title.   It is more likely to continue until we aresqueezed dry and  are either obliged to pay a wholly extortionate compensation, orto force Persia to  adopt an attitude more in conformity with our interests by actionwhich may adversely affect us internationally.    With these observations, I turn to a  closer examination  of the two points in issue.  As regards the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the oil industry, which it repre-sents, has for practical purposes been created by British capital, and it brings in avery substantial and  increasing  yearly revenue  to  Persia.   So long  as normalpeaceful relations  continue to exist between this country and Persia, the only threatswhich the Persian Government could make to the position of  the Company are the cancellation of their concession and its transfer to a foreign company (the possibilityof effective exploitation of the oil-wells by  the Persians themselves need &quot;not perhapsseriously be considered), the imposition of prohibitive taxation, or the  impositionof a requirement  as to the establishment  of a controlling Persian interest in themanagement.  In the event of cancellation of the concession, the case, internationally,of the Company (and of His Majesty&apos;s Government) would, in my view, be sufficiently strong to make possible the application of pressure to Persia without putting our-selves in the  wrong.   Unreasonable taxation  or  interference with the company would, I recognise, be more difficult to deal with, but the sacrifice of substantialrevenues for the satisfaction of a nationalistic jealousy in which it would result  islikely,  I suggest, to lead the Persian Government  to move slowly in this direction,if at all.   In the event of  war, the  seizure of  the oil area is recommended by theIndian General Staff.  The views of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee are not yet available to me, but, primd facie, on a point of this character, I should infer thatno marked difference of opinion is likely to exist between the view which I have justquoted and the view held by the War  Office and the Admiralty.   I suggest, on abroad view, that the possible Persian threat to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company ismore of a bugbear  than a reality.     The question of the League of Nations  admittedly presents features of a different character, and the danger that the League may be invoked against us calls for careful examination.   But here I suggest that the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government isstronger than might at first sight be thought to be the case.   There are two classesof question on which  appeal may be made  to the League against our  position byPersia.   The  first are  territorial  questions; the  second are our  unauthorised&quot; privileges &quot;  in   the Gulf.   The  territorial  questions fall  into  two  distinctcategories.   The  first category includes concessions such  as  Hen jam  and  Basidu,in which we recognise Persian sovereignty,  and on which  we could not in practiceresist pressure from. her.   These  are&apos; unlikely to  reach  the League.   The secondincludes questions such as the  status of Bahrein; the status of those islands in theGulf which are claimed, or which have been recognised  by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, as belonging to the Arab Rulers under our protection; and the Persian claimto suzerainty over the whole Arab littoral  from Koweit to Muscat.   But in all thesecases the Persian claim, as I am advised, is extremely weak or wholly unsustainable.The counterclaim of the Arab Rulers is at least as strong in law and history, andhas the further justification that it rests on.a status quo which reaches back into the18th century or earlier, and His  Majesty&apos;s Government,  who have themselves no territorial ambitions, are entitled to appear before the League (though not necessarilyto recognise it as a final arbiter), as  the agents  of the Arab Rulers  who, underTreaties of Various dates from  1820, are entitled to their protection, and to maintain that the claim of  those Rulers, who are in possession, is  at least as good as that  of persia.     As regards the &quot; special privileges,&quot;  His Majesty&apos;s Government, if cited beforethe League, can clearly establish that they have in the  past  acquired or exercisedthose privileges solely because  of Persian  impotence (which subsists to  this day)  todischarge them, and the international necessity of providing for their discharge, and can offer to relinquish them as, and in so  far as, Persia,  within what can properly be recognised,  aft  Persian waters, is competent to take them over.  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, in other  words, have, in my  judgment, a strong defence to put beforethe League in so far as they may be challenged by Persia, and in these circumstancesundue weight should  not,  I suggest, be attached, in considering the policy to  be adopted in dealing with Persia, to the danger of League intervention.     The views which I have  embodied in  this memorandum, must necessarily  beregarded as provisional, and I recognise that the course of the discussion may leadme to modify them in substantial respects.   My object in communicating them to my
colleagues at this moment is to endeavour to focus discussion on certain, at any rate,of the major issues which call for consideration, and to facilitate the examination ofSir Robert Clive and of the other witnesses who may appear before the Sub-Committeein the early stages of  its resumed deliberations.  My conclusions can be resumed ina very few words.  They are that, as matters stand, we have no  choice but to dealwith the present Central Government in Persia;  that what is left of our special position  on the South  Persian coast  cannot well  be defended if it  is vigorouslychallenged by Persia; and that, in the interests of maintaining British supremacyin the Gulf, we must therefore be prepared to consolidate our position on the Arabshore (on which, in any case, our obligations to the Arab Rulers, and the importanceof the Air Route, make it impossible for us to make any concession to Persia), and,in the attainment of this object, to adopt a vigorous offensive policy towards Persianclaims directed against the Rulers of that shore or  of the islands in the Gulf; and,finally, that,  in adopting, as the best means of defence, a vigorous  counter-offensive,it  is unnecessary to attach an undue  importance  either  to the  threat which anunfriendly  Persia  might constitute to the  operations  of  the Anglo-Persian  oil company, or, from  a different standpoint, to the risk that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentmay be delated by her to the League of Nations.
