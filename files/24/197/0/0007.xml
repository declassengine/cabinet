THIS aOOUMMT 13 T&apos;HE PROPERTY Off HI 3 ERITMHIC MkJBaE-Y18 GOV^MEIT,                            OiBIJEt.SECRETCP&quot;.857(28)                                       COPY MO..                        SHE FACTORIES BILL.       MemornadtUD by the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of          Labour,  circulated by &quot;direction of the Minister of &quot;Labour.          Ehe principal point in which the Ministry of Labour are     interested is Clause 68, which limits the hours of employment     of women and young persons.   Two alternatives are suggested:-          (1)  A clause limiting the hours to 48 (plus overtime               under Clause 69).          (2)  A clause limiting the hours in effect to 51^ (plus               overtime),          There is also a third possibility, namely, to leave the     existing enactments, which fix the limit at 55^ for textile     factories and 60 for non-textile factories, unaltered.          She question must he considered in relation to the     Washington Hours Convention.    The Government have stated     that they cannot ratify it in its present form, and have     pressed at Geneva for revision, but they have stated     repeatedly that they adhere to the principle of the 48-hour     week..   The attitude of the Government  has been viewed with     the greUtest suspicion, and the allegation has been freely     made that their object in asking for revision is merely     to wreck the Convention altogether.  If in the Factories     Bill the existing limits of hours for women and children     are altered and a higher limit than 48  is inserted, there     will be a triumphant howl of exeoration from all our critics     both at home and abroad, at this confirmation of their  worst     suspicions of the British Governments  hypocrisy.   There     is no doubt that, even apart from international considerations,     the ideal of the 48-hour week, which is in practice observed     over the greater part of British industry,  means a great  deal to     large numbers of men and women in ?;h.is  country, and tc  er.fc.ot     at this time, when the law was being changed,  a higher  limit
than 48, would be regarded by many as a proof that the Governmentwas associating itself with the &quot;attack upon hours&quot; which manyemployers are suspected of contemplating.      It is possible to argue that the Factories Bill deals withthe matter only from a social or health point of view, and that the insertion of a limit of 51% hours (a curiou3 figure In itself)does not prejudice the possibility of further legislation firinga maximum of 48, if and when the Washington Convention has been revised.  Such an explanation would carry very little convictionin this country and none at all abroad.       Vfhatever credit can be obtained from the passing of the factories Bill will be largely nullified If the second alternative(51-1 hours ) *s adopted.  Unless the Government is prepared totake the plunge and fix 48, it appears far preferable fco leave theexisting limits unaltered, explaining that the whole question of hours of labour Is under discussion in connection with theWashington Hours Convention.         It Is probably in the interests of industry that theBill should be passed in the next six months, but its passage in the House in certain to be protracted.  The employers1organisations would like the Bill to pass, but they are boundto move a number of amendments in Committee which will take time.The Labour Party will certainly treat the Bill as a reactionarymeasure, and will seek to amend It at every step in order to restore it to the form of Mr. Benders on&apos;s 1924 3111.  its passage through the House will accordingly be very siow.  Sofar as industry In concerned, It would probably be better not tointroduce it at all than to introduce It and then fail to pas3 it,and to Introduce it with an hours limit of 51t and then fail topass.it would be a course attended by the maximum of discredit.Minlstry^of Labour.                                                                     I23rd July, 1928.
