Printed for the Cabinet.SECRET.                                                     Copy No.   28CP. 300 (28).                                 CABINET.PREFERENCE  IN  GOVERNMENT  CONTRACTS.    MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY  OF  STATE  FOR DOMINION  AFFAIRS.    AT the Conservative Party Conference at Yarmouth  the other day I foundmyself in the position, as the  only Minister present,  of having to defend theaction of  the Post Office  in  ordering certain  quantities of bronze  wire fromabroad.   My  defence, I think,  satisfied my  audience at the  time,  but has been subjected to  considerable criticism since.  I am afraid that a closer  study of thequestion has convinced me that the whole  question of departmental  preference for British goods is in an unsatisfactory position.    The Treasury circular of the 3rd February,  1919,  laid down that  &quot; it is thedesire of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the preference in Government contracts should be effective,  and whilst  they think it undesirable to lay down any exactpercentage, they  desire that  .  ...  the Dominions, Colonies and  Protectoratesshould  have  the  full advantage of  their decision.&quot;   The  Imperial  EconomicConference in 1923 passed resolutions reaffirming  the principle and these werecirculated to  Departments  in a Treasury minute of the  16th January, 1924.   Thequestions whether  the rate of preference should be fixed and made public  was raised at the Conference, but the suggestion was  opposed by the Treasury on theground  that  it might weaken the  hands of  Departments  in negotiating,  and encourage British  and Dominion tenderers  to put up  their  price up  to the fullmargin  afforded by the preference, and was not pressed.    I venture to  submit  that  the time  has come when,  both on economic  andon political grounds, that  decision should be reconsidered.   The present situationleaves every  Department,  in  effect,  the  judge of what  should  be a  matter ofnational policy.  It  also makes every order abroad, regardless of the  merits of thecase, the occasion for attacks upon the Government to which there is  no answerexcept the vague one, which is all I was able  to give in the  present case, that some measure of preference was offered, to which the rejoinder is at once  made that itwas wholly insufficient to meet the difference in wage costs, &amp;c.  It seems to methat the only satisfactory policy  is to calculate a fair  rate of preference taking into account  both the wage differences involved in the existence of the Fair Wagesclause and the loss of revenue, national and municipal (20-25 per cent, of the cost),involved in the order going abroad to  make that  rate  known  and,  subject tothat, to give  all orders on  strictly competitive lines.  When I was at the admiralty laid down that the preference should be 25 per cent, for home, and 16f for Empire,over foreign goods.  The system  worked satisfactorily in every way, and I believethat,  apart from  oil fuel, over 98 per cent, of the Admiralty&apos;s requirements arebought  within the Empire.    In  the present instance I understand the Post Office offered the contract tothe British &quot; ring &quot; at a price of  27 10s. a ton as against a  price of  32  15s. quoted by the &quot; ring,&quot; and an average price  of  23 16s. actually paid to the foreign firms.In  other words, they offered a preference  of about 15J  per cent.   Conceding theoriginal demand of the British firms would  have involved a  preference of about37% per cent, over the average price paid.   I have, of course, no means of knowingwhether the  British  firms would have come down to  within  a  25 per cent.       [18304]
preference, had that figure been offered.  Nor, in the absence of definite Cabinetinstructions on the subject, am I suggesting any criticism of the Post  Office  for not making such an offer.  My only point is that such an offer, based on a definite and accepted principle, would have afforded the Government  a complete reply to subsequent criticism.  If accepted, we could have pointed out that the loss to thePost Office, as Post Office, was balanced by the gain to national and local revenuesfrom having the order carried out  here.  If rejected, we should have- had no lessstrong a case with reasonable public opinion in refusing to pay an excessive price.    A definite announcement in Parliament that in future preference in contractswill  be given in accordance with  fixed and known principles and  on  fixed and published percentages, both for home and Empire products, would not  only avoidmisunderstandings, domestic and  inter-Imperial, and furnish a  standard whichcould not fail to influence the action of municipal and other public authorities inthis country, and of  Governments and public authorities elsewhere in the Empire,but would also  be warmly welcomed  by the general public as a praotical measureof administrative safeguarding to British industry.                                   &apos;                                Li, S. A.    Dominions Office,             October 15, 1928.
