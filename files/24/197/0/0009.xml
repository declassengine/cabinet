THIS DOCUMENT 3S THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC  MAJBSTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.                            CABINET.              Copy No. &quot;7  j)                  Reconstituted and Synthetic Cream.      Memorandum by the Minister of Health.                I wish to submit for the  consideration of the      Cabinet the question of the course  to  be  adopted with regard      to a Bill for regulating the sale of reconstituted and      synthetic cream.                It should be explained that  the expression      &quot;Reconstituted Cream&quot; is used as meaning  an article prepared      by the emulsification of butter with other constituents  of      milk so that It Is as nearly as possible  Identical  in      composition with natural cream obtained by direct separation      from milk.   The investigations which  have been made  by  my      Department and the Government Chemist  show that if      reconstituted cream Is carefully prepared It is impossible      to distinguish It from natural cream by any scientific      methods.   Reconstituted ciream is in effect cream imported      from dairying countries and by reason  of  the lower  cost  of      production It can be sold at about  half the price of  natural      cream.                Reconstituted cream has the  further advantage  that      its materials can be stored and It  can be prepared as and      when required.   According to my information confectioners      have recently been using it to an increasing extent in place      of natural cream as a filling for cakes,  etc,   I have heard      allegations that it is sometimes sold  to  the public as cream,      but I doubt if this occurs to any large extent  and  the      allegation is difficult to check because  of the impossibilityRET.  260(28)
of distinguishing reconstituted cream.          It has been represented that the increased use ofreconstituted cream Is the result of the regulationsprohibiting the use of preservatives in cream,   I do notthink that there is much basis for this view.  A sufficientexplanation for the increased use of this cream is to be foundin Its lower cost of production and in the recent developmentof emulsifying machines, (It may be noted that the prohibitionof the use of preservatives applies also to reconstituted cream).          The expression &quot;synthetic Cream&quot; is used as meaningan imitation of cream which contains Ingredients not derivedfrom milk.   Its relation to cream or reconstituted cream issimilar to that o  margarine to butter and it can easily be distinguished from them by chemical methods*.  According to my information synthetic cream is only Used by confectioners.  IfIt were sold to the public as cream the fact would easily bedetected and proceedings could be taken under the Sale of food and Drugs Acts.          From the point *?f view of my Department as representingboth public health and the general Interests of the consumer,I do not consider that there Is any real necessity for further legislation.   The safeguarding against contamination of thesubstances which make up reconstituted cream should be secured by the existing provisions of the Public Health Acts;  the Sale*of Pood and Drugs Act are sufficient to prevent the sale of synthetic cream as cream and there is no demonstrable prejudice to a purchaser if reconstituted cream is sold to him in placeof cream*          It Is generally agreed that if any steps are takento control the sale of reconstituted cream, it must be by meansof the registration and inspection of the premises at which it isprepared and sold, and&apos; by a requirement as to labelling.  This
^rould involve some addition to the work of the staff -of local,authorities and it is passible that the retirements might; b^-evaded to such an extent as to render the legislationineffective since the product is Indistinguishable--from thenatural article, and the machinery required for its preparationis so small that It can easily be concealed.          The advent of reconstituted cream and its competition with natural cream has given rise to a considerable amount ofagitation on the part of the National Farmers1 Union and theAgricultural Members of the House of Coranono.  They feel strongly that it should not be sold without declaration andalso that It should in terms be. subject to the same publichealth provisions as cream.  Whether legislation on theselines would really benefit the agricultural Interest Is opento doubt since statutory control might result In giving agratuitous advertisement to the reconstituted article.  Inany event it seems to be recognised that as the price to thepublic is. reduced reconstituted cream must inevitablydisplace natural cream to a large extent, and if the latter is to compete successfully Its price will probably have tobe determined like that of British butter and cheese by reference to the price of the corresponding Imported commodity.          To give effect to the views of the agriculturalinterest Mr, Everard introduced a Bill late In the present session to control the production, distribution and sale ofreconstituted and synthetic cream.   After the Bill hadreceived a Second Reading 1 discussed it with the promotersand informed them that I should see no objection to a Billlimited in its application to reconstituted croam and providing-     (1) that places where this article is prepared or sold         should be registered;
     (2) that it should be sold under a prescribed         designation and the receptacles labelled accordingly,         and     (3) that it should be subject to the same public health         provisions as natural cream.          The promoters accepted ray suggested amendment ofthe Bill and asked the Chief Whip to find time for Itsfurther stages during the present Session^   He was unableto arrange this and at his suggestion they then asked me totake the Bill up as a Government measure.          For the reasons I have sei out fully above I amof opinion that the Bill would not be of much serviceeither to the farmers or to the public, and I am not disposedat this date to give any definite pledge to introduce theBill..   I should propose, however, if the Cabinet agrees,to inform the promoters that consideration will be given tothe question of the introduction of a Government Bill at alater date If Parliamentary time permits,           w                              N.C.30th July,  1928.
