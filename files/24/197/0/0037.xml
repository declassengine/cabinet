4 W P*1 id   [This Document is  the Property  of  His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government.]                     Printed for the Cabinet.     October 1928.SECRET.CP. 288 (28).Attitude  of Indian  Politicians.       MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE  FOR INDIA.   I circulate for the information  of my colleagues an extract from  a recent  private letter (dated 6th September) which I have received from  the Viceroy regarding the trend towards the Left of All-India politicians.                                                              BIRKENHEAD.     4th October 1928.          Extract from private letter- from Lord Irwin to Lord Birkenhead,                            dated Qth September 1928.   I am a good deal concerned at the several indications that there are of the degree to which Indian political thought is moving to the Left.  I have not only in mind thetalk in the most  extreme quarters  about independence.  This  is  serious, and I amhaving it examined from the legal aspect.   But what is not less  symptomatic is the degree to which erstwhile moderate opinion, as  rep resented by Sapru, is prepared tomake terms with  such talk, as we  have seen in the introduction  to  the All-PartiesReport and  the proceedings at  Luckuow.  It is also significant  that, whereas two orthree years ago  the Nationalist of  different persuasions was generally disposed toagree that  Foreign Affairs and Defence could  not be committed  to popular control,they have now gone beyond this position, and, with  scant regard for logic  and fact,claimed the lot.   As you  know, one of the  principal purposes that I had in  view in  our recentexchange  of correspondence  in connection with Setalvad&apos;s proposals was to try to break the artificial unity at present prevailing between the different sections of our political opponents, and I think that this will be our principal problem in  the courseof the next year or two.  There is nothing to be done at the moment, but I think thatwe should do well to recognise  quite clearly that these currents are running stronglyand  look  like continuing to do so.   It is,  of course, true that  these  tendencies are-much more noticeable in  all-India politics than in the provincial sphere, and I fully recognise the limitations at  present  on the  representative character of the  all-Indiapolitician.   But it is, to my mind, inevitable that, as education expands  and as theinfluence of the Indian Press  grows,  all these ideas  will also make wider and  more powerful appeal.3141    75  10.28
