Papers regarding the  Limitation  of Naval                 Armaments.                            No. 1.Extract from the Opening Speech of the President, at the Third   Session  of  the  Preparatory Commission  on  Disarmament,   March 21-April 26, 1927.   THE PRESIDENT. The  work of the third  session of our Commis-sion will doubtless be the heaviest, but at the same time it is more clearly denned than that of preceding meetings.        *****   The work of our Commission is not to find the basis of a purelytheoretical understanding; it is to reach some concrete  results, toestablish agreements with regard to principles, to lay the foundations of the Convention,  and even, if possible, to  draft the text of a Con-vention which  would greatly  simplify  the work  of  the  general conference.                            No. 2.    Extract from a Speech hy Viscount Cecil of Chelwood at the          Preparatory Commission on March 26,  1927.   THE British Government  have, I need not say, in common withall the other Governments, been considering this question with thegreatest care, and they have thought that probably the best way theycan help in a solution of this very grave question is to present to this commission  a draft project  of Convention, not, of  course,  with aview of imposing the solutions there stated upon their colleagues that would be an absurd pretension but to form the basis of a dis-cussion which we  hope will be more fruitful than any other way of approaching this delicate and difficult subject.  I have drawn up thatConvention, and before I proceed with my observations I will ask the secretariat to be good enough to hand round copies in English andFrench of that  Convention.

Description.Battleships and Battle Cruisers	War-ships of great displacement that embody the maximum armament protection and mobility which it is practical to combine in a single vessel. In the Battle Cruiser armament and protection are, in some degree, sacrificed to speed.,Cruisers ...	War-ships of medium displacement in which moderate armament and protection are combined with great speed.Aircraft Carriers	War-ships designed for the specific and exclusive purpose of carrying aircraft.

Principal weapon, the torpedo.   Note. There are also other types in existence, such as Coast Defence Battle-ships specially constructed for operating in the vicinity of a coast line ; torpedo boats, which  are small destroyers  lacking in  sea-keeping  qualities ; Sloops,Mine-sweepers, &amp;c, which are small types of war vessel for patrol, convoy ormine-sweeping purposes ; River Gunboats, which are specially designed for operating in shallow waters and in rivers.                          .* Not drawn up.

No.  6.Extract from a Speech by Viscount Cecil at the 18th Public Meeting,   held on April 5, 1927, on the Naval Sections of the British Draft   Convention.                                         i   VISCOUNT CECIL (British  Empire). I  desire  to  offer  a fewobservations in explanation of the  system of naval limitation whichthe British Government has put forward.  I remember that,  when had  the honour of  addressing  this  Commission on  a  militaryquestion on the limitation of military effectives I explained thatthis was a matter which did not directly affect us, since our securitywas  not bound up  primarily with the strength  of  our  land army.But  of course, when you come to deal with naval questions,  thematter is  entirely different  and  there  I  cannot  pretend to bedisinterested in the matter.   The whole  existence of  the BritishEmpire depends upon  the  security of its communications and  thefreedom of its commerce,  and those two considerations,  apart fromothers, make it obvious that  any question of fleet limitation is  amatter of the highest possible importance to us, and when we try to put  in force, as a Member  of the League  of Nations,  the obliga-tions to put  forward  schemes  for  the  reduction of  our  naval armaments to the lowest possible consistent with national safety, we
have, of course,  to consider very carefully any^ propositions which deal with the limitation and reduction of the fleet.    We   cannot  accept  a  system  which   disregards  numbersaltogether, such as the total-tonnage system, and we have a further difficulty about accepting it in that in practice it gives no limit eitherto the size of ships or to the calibre of the guns.    That seems to ue  to leave the matter too much at large,  and we feel that it is quite essential that, in the first place, there should be some effective limitation of numbers, and, in the second place,  thatthere should be  an  effective limitation both  of the size of ships and of the size of guns.        *          *           *           *           -i^:-    That brings me to the conclusion which the British Governmenthold very strongly that the only fair system, the only efficient andclear system is  to have in some form  or  another a limitation byclasses,  including, that  is to  say, the obvious limitation of the well-known descriptions of ships.   I think there are  some eight or ninewhich are perfectly well understood by all naval authorities, whichare used in every book of naval statistics that is printed, whetherthey  be publications by the League authorities, by Governmentauthorities or by private statisticians.  I will read  a list of thesedescriptions :  battleships,  cruisers,  aircraft-carriers,  destroyers,torpedo-boats, submarines,  sloops,  mine-sweepers  and river gun-boats.  I think that includes the classes  to be found in all textbooksdealing  with the  subject,  and  the  British proposition is that  you should have your fleet divided into these  classes and that each of the classes  should be  limited by numbers and by  the size of the ships and of the guns which those ships can carry.        &amp;                       $fc           4)f           ^    I  want to correct  one misapprehension  which appears to. me tohave  underlain a  good  deal  of  the  discussion which took place in sub-Commission  A.   It  seems  to have  been assumed that, if  youlimit by classes, that means that you are  to have the same proportionin each  class, i.e., that if you have one Power which has a proportionof five battleships to  one,  you are to have the same proportion inevery other class.  That is quite untrue  and is not involved in thissystem  at all.  On the contrary, there would be full liberty  for thefinal Conference to take into consideration the requirements  of each country and to  allot to it quite different  proportions in the differentclasses.    That is the  main case I desire to  put before  you, and. theproposal made  by the. British Government is  clear and has beenproved  in actual practice to be practicable.   It avoids secrecy,  itlimits competition, it  gives to the nations of the world a  clear viewof the armaments of their neighbours and of the other countries,  and
1 cannot conceal from you the fact that the British Governmentattaches the greatest possible importance to the adoption of a systemof this kind for the limitation of naval armaments.                             No. 7.Extract from the Speeches -made at tlie 19th Public Meeting &apos;pbi    April  5,  1927,  on the British  and French Draft Conventions    (Naval Sections).    MR. secretary (Japan). For the moment, I propose merely to lay before  the Commission my Government&apos;s views as to the methodof limiting  war  material.  I  have nothing new  to  say, for my government upholds the  views expressed by the Japanese experts in Sub-Commission  A.    I  should  like,  however,  to  outline  briefly  the  technical,economic  and political arguments on  which our opinion  is based.    I will  begin with the  French draft.   That draft does  not  evendraw a  distinction between surface ships and submarines,  which,from  a military  point  of view, should  be clearly distinguished.There  is  another disadvantage from  the military  point  of view;aircraft-carriers  are  designed to carry aircraft and to be used asbases for air operations;  if,  therefore,  a  clear distinction  werenot made in the  case of this class of ships,  it would be impossibleaccurately to gauge the  extent of the  limitation  undertaken inthe air forces attached to the  navy  and  distributed  among  itsvarious  branches.   There  would  be  a gain  in  clearness  if  a distinction were  established between different classes of ships.       *****    M.  PAUL-BONCOUR (France).- I think none  of  us can  fail torealise that  we have arrived at a critical point in our work.    No limitation  of armaments is possible unless it covers  the three categories of armaments -land, air  and naval; further, no limita-tion of naval armaments is possible if there is a difference of opinion between  the  great  naval Powers   and the  rest that  cannot  be overcome.  I hope Lord Cecil will give  me credit for weighing  withgreat care as I always do,  but perhaps more particularly to-day the arguments he has put forward.   In the first place, I appreciatehie having openly and very honestly stated the  special  position ofhis own country  with regard  to naval  armaments,  which for  thatcountry is a  vital question.  No Conference would be possible ifeach country could not state here quite openly the particular reasonscompelling it  to  claim a given maximum in respect of land, air or naval armaments.  Our duty here is to conceal none of  the special needs of any one of. us with-regard either to land armaments or to naval armaments, or to both.  And here  I do  not think we areconcerned with figures; when the final decision is taken,  whateverform of limitation is adopted, no  one will  dispute the fact that,given the  special  position of certain great maritime countries, these
should retain in the figures allowed them a superiority which no one would think of denying them.   Lord Cecil asks more than this.   The Japanese delegate asks more than this.   They ask that, apart from any figure  which,  in their opinion,will  ensure  to their own countries an undoubted  advantage, other nations which have fleets and need fleets should accept an additionallimitation of each class of craft which they possess.  Here we clearly have a fundamental difference of opinion.   No less frankly than the Japanese delegate and Lord Cecil  havegiven the reasons which lead  them to adopt this  definite  attitudewith regard  to tonnage and to tonnage limitation of naval armamentsby classes, do I, taking my turn  after those  countries  which  havealready expressed  their views and before those which will no doubtexpress theirs later, wish to tell you why,  although we are preparedfor any  limitations and  do not seek to cancel by  indirect meansprivileged maxima justified by geographical  situations  and vitalnecessities,  we  are nevertheless unable to  accept this limitation byclasses.        *****   If you accept limitation by classes, whatever tonnage be allowed for each class a question which is not at present under discussion you  inevitably stereotype your navy  in a  certain  form and with  acertain classification.   The great naval Powers, to which  a superiortonnage has been  allotted in virtue of the Washington Agreements,can  obviously contemplate with a light heart and an  even mind the  variations  which  may  occur in technique or for - any other reason.  Their supremacy is assured by the  capital ships  at  their disposal  which  Washington allows them and. which they keep up.Their anxieties?  The doubts  which perplex  some Powers  do not exist for them.  But  for those Powers whose  future is  a blank,  or nearly so;  for those that deliberately&apos;, in the period immediately following the war, wished to effect the inevitable  reductions whichshould follow, and which we are here to effect;  for those countries that  have only retained freedom of development in respect of smallunits;  for them, any  unexpected changes which  may occur in navaltechnique,  at a  time  when everything is in a state of flux,  clearlyinvolve a problem  which they  cannot solve in  its entirety and for  a given length of time.        *          *          *          *           *   The Hon. HUGH GIBSON (United States of America).&apos; I should like  to preface  my  remarks  by  saying   that I  am in complete agreement with  what M. Paul-Boncour said-that  we are not  hereto deal with actual figures or  ratios.  I  agree that we are  hereto deal with the general  aspects of the problem which is presented by seeking to agree upon some method of limitation, and I should like  to  have that  borne, clearly in mind  in  connexion with what i am about to  say that  my  remarks are addressed entirely  tothe technical difficulties  of finding a generally acceptable  method
of limitation  without  reference  to figures  or ratios,  or  to any given country or any group of countries.       *           *         -  *           *,           *   The American delegation  has found no  reason to change  theviews of its  technical advisers as they  were set forth in  detailon pages 81  to  85 inclusive of the report of Sub-Commission A.This fully set forth our views as to the desirability of the  methodof limitation by classes.   We find that  an  insuperable objectionto the method of limitation of naval armaments by  the limitationof total  tonnage  lies  in the  application of  this method  as  setforth in the second clause of this article of the French draft:        &quot;Each of  the  High  Contracting  Parties  shall  be  free to   distribute  and allocate its total tonnage  as may  be best  for   the  purposes  of  security  and the  &quot;defence  of  its  national   interests.&quot;   We  feel  that such  an application  would  be  in  no  senseconsistent  with  the  primary  purpose  of  any  DisarmamentConference as I have stated it.   Such an  application would  not do  away  with  the competition  in  naval  armaments;  on  thecontrary, it practically invites such  competition  by opening widethe door for it.   The provision allowing  each country  to  be  free  to distributeand  arrange the  total  tonnage  allowed  to  it,  without providingin the agreement for the allocation of such tonnage, contains  thegerm of eventual competition.   Such  an  application would  notlessen international suspicion, uneasiness and  mistrust;  indeed,it is hard to imagine any system  which  would tend to  createsuspicion  and mistrust  more than   secret  building  programmesconceived and laid down under such loose conditions.   We grant  that limitation by  total tonnage may be  effective inthe  case of small navies  having  only very limited -categories ofcombatant  craft, but even in such cases  the  -application, as dealtwith  in  the  second clause  of  this  article,  is  open to   serious objection.  It would be  practicable if each  State had  to considerits   own interests and  only  its  own  interests.   This  methodundoubtedly  appeals to  the individual  State in that it can bestprovide for its  own security by  being able  to allocate all  or  anypart  of  the  tonnage  to whatever class it  deems  best  without previous agreement.  At the same time, it would be unfair  to the neighbouring  States,  which  must  compete  to  provide for their security, and which  would  therefore be  constantly in  a  state ofuneasiness and  mistrust.   We believe that the  maximum size of each category should be prescribed,  also  the maximum calibre of gun and  the maximumdiameter of torpedo-tube, because we  are. convinced that we cannotgo wrong if we  deal with tangible and visible  characteristics  ratherthan complicate  the problem by  dealing  with characteristics thatare  not  openly visible to all the world, that cares  to see.   Webelieve in prescribing the  maximum diameter of torpedo-tube in
order to restrict, as far as possible, competition in that destructiveweapon.  I think it is perfectly well known to all  my colleagues that we believe in dealing only  with the  tonnages  in various categories because it seems to us that, when a limitation is placedon the total tonnage of a  category, and the maximum unit tonnageof that  category is prescribed, a sufficiently definite limitation  upon that particular category of ship will be effected.   However, we are ready to consider the  possibility of a more definite limitation  if one  is  presented which  seems to attain the  end  desired  in  apractical and reasonable manner.        *           *          *           *-           -*   GENERAL DE MARINIS  (Italy). I entirely support the  remarksmade by M. Paul-Boncour and I shall not go over them again lestthey should lose some  of their force after the clear, accurate andeloquent statement he made.  I wish to say that I entirely agree withhim and adopt all the arguments developed by him and by the otherspeakers who opposed the principle of limiting by  classes but  werein favour of limiting total  tonnage, the only form of limitation which my country can accept.        *           *          *           *           *                            - No. 8.  Extract from the Speeches made at the 26th Public Meeting on       April 11, 1927, on the French Compromise Proposal.   THE PRESIDENT. The Commission  has before it  the french proposal.     The limitation of naval armaments  agreed  to by  each of the         High Contracting Parties is shown in the annexed. Table X.     The figures in Column I of this table represent the total tonnage         that  each of the  High  Contracting. Parties  considers  it         essential to  attain  for the purposes of security  and  the         defence of its national interests.     The figures in Column II represent the total tonnage that each         of the High Contracting Parties considers it necessary to         complete before the expiry of the Convention.     The figures  in Column III represent   for  each  of the High         Contracting Parties the division of the total tonnage  stated         by it in Column II into total tonnage by groups.  This total         tonnage by groups  applies to all  vessels  classed as  follows :         (a) capital ships; (6) aircraft carriers;  (c) surface vessels         under 10,000 tons; (d) submarines.     Each of the High Contracting Parties, while  keeping within the         limits of total tonnage stated in  Column II, can alter such         division as it deems necessary  for  its security, subject to         informing the  Secretariat of the League of Nations of the
changes effected  in  the division of its  total tonnage,  atleast one year before laying down the portion of the tonnage which is to be transferred.Note. Each  of the  High Contracting  Parties  states  in    Column III the division of its total tonnage, either into    the four groups  of vessels as stated in paragraph 4 or    only into those groups which it considers necessary for    its needs  of security.TABLE X.Total tonnage of vessels employed       for home defence.* a.2ii.(D OuCD Pi- &amp;oHIII.

In  an  earlier  stage  ofour  discussion  I   endeavoured to  explain  to  the  commission the  difference in  the  attitude that we  must  necessarily adoptwith regard to questions affecting  the  naval  aspect  of  the matterand&apos; questions affecting the armies.    I  cannot pretend  to  be convinced that the  provisional  solution  at which we have arrivedabout the army is,  from our point  of view, a satisfactory one.  we still  believe that some  account ought  to be  taken of the trainedreserves or, at any rate, some portion  of the  trained  reserves  of
different countries.  We have felt, and I have stated it all along, thatthat is a matter which however strongly we may feel about it as amatter of principle, does affect other countries very much more than ourselves, and  that, if  a limit can be. arrived  at which would not include any limitation  of  trained reserves   amongst  the  othercountries, then I  do  not  think it  would be at all  likely  that my government would insist on  its view with respect to  that.        *****    In these circumstances,  we are  unable  at present  to  makeany fresh proposal than that  which is contained in our draft, exceptthis:  We have been very much moved by the case of the very smallnavies, which are undoubtedly in a very difficult position, and if,after the fullest consideration, these very small navies should desiresome  freer  system, some system  approaching the system of total tonnage, then that would be a special case which my Governmentwould  certainly be anxious to consider.    It  is obvious  that, when you  come  to  comparatively&apos; small amounts of  tonnage,  there is not  the  same danger of competition,and there is not the same danger of any radical change in thenavalaspect of things which might be wrought by a change  in  policy ofone of the more important  naval Powers.    That is  the position at  which the  British Government havearrived.  They recognise that a desire has been shown to meet their requirements.   They  deeply  regret that they  have, been unable tosee that the proposals now made really  do meet what  they  regard as essential. In  this matter they  feel most profoundly that theywould  be false to their responsibilities if they accepted  any system which  did not give real security.   In  land matters  they  may say,perhaps legitimately, that &quot; other countries  are more concernedthan we are; if they  are satisfied with the system, even if it seemsto us  an incomplete system,  we would not press our opinion to thelast point on a matter of that kind.&quot;   But on naval questions they feel they  have  a special  responsibility;  they feel  that  their experience-is at least as great as  that of  any other nation  in theworld  in this matter.  They  feel that their interests,   that thehappiness and, indeed,  the existence of  their  people depends uponno  mistake  being  made in that respect, and, therefore,  with thegreatest possible  regret, they  feel bound  to scrutinise with great care any proposal put before  them, and, as at  present advised, theresult of their scrutiny has been to convince them that  the french proposal does  not comply  with  the minimum  requirements of security and avoidance of competition which they feel they  must lay down as a  condition  of any  successful or tolerable system  of thereduction and limitation of naval armaments.    M. PAUL-BONCOUB (France). I very  much regret and onlymy. desire  not to imply  any  criticism  of the State  in  question.prevents my expressing this  regret more fully that the  proposal,essentially  in the nature  of a compromise,  which was  officiallysubstituted on Saturday for the first French draft was not approvedby the British Government.  Its conciliatory nature may be gauged
by  comparing it,  representing  as it does the  extreme  limit ofconcession that my country could  make, with  the first proposal fora total tonnage figure not limited  by  any other provision.   The reason  for  which  my  country  and   a  large  number of continental  and Maritime countries put forward  the suggestion oftotal tonnage and  the reasons which  compelled them to reject thesystem of limitation according to  classes  were explained last  weekand there is no need to revert to them.       *           *           *           *          *   MR. secretary (Japan). Now, I will say a few  words on the subjectof the new  French proposal.   We all recognise that the  french delegation  has  made  great efforts -by  mutual  concessions toarrive at an agreement.   We all also approve of the able  wording-of this new  proposal, and we wish to express our appreciation tothe French  delegation for its endeavours.  Certain points of thisproposal seem to us rather difficult to accept.   I shall not  raisehere fundamental issues of principle, but I must mention thefollowing points on  which, however, I think-  it should  not bedifficult for us to reach  an agreement after further discussion.   Our delegation is of opinion  that  it is sufficient to indicate thenumbers provided  for in column II of the table presented by theFrench delegation;  this column should  read  as follows :  &apos;&apos;  total tonnage which each  State  undertakes not to exceed  during the term of the Convention.&quot;   In this way  we  should do away  withthe first column.   Further, in view of the mobility  of naval  forces, I do not see any reason for distinguishing between vessels employed for homedefence and vessels employed in the  defence of overseas territory.This point  has already been raised by General  de Marinis,  and,unless I am mistaken, by Lord  Cecil.  If these changes and anyfurther changes, of course, that  other  delegations  may  wish tomake: are  taken  into  consideration, I  am  of  opinion  that theFrench proposal would form a useful  basis for discussion.       *****                             No.  9.Extract from  the  Closing  Speech of the President (M.  London),     on April 26, 1927, reviewing the  Work of the Session.   THE PRESIDENT. We have now come to  the end  of the first stage of our work.  You may remember that at the beginning ofour first meeting I told  you that  we must prepare the public notto expect  miracles from our first step towards a reduction and limitation  of  armaments.  The general political  situation was notpropitious,  and our  way was beset with  difficulties, the extent ofwhich  public opinion did not, and could not, realise.   In  1921,  the  five  most important naval  Powers  made  a beginning at Washington  towards checking  competition  in naval
armaments, and the result they achieved was appreciable.    Butthe problem of the limitation of armaments in  its widest sensehas never  before in the history of the world been, approached bya  meeting  of  political  delegates.  Our work  had indeed  beenadmirably  prepared  by first-class  experts who deserve our highestpraise;  nevertheless,  from the. political point  of view, it  wouldhave benefited  by even, more  careful preparation.   The public  seems to have forgotten  the fact  that  we are onlya  Preparatory  Commission,  and  to have  ingenuously  imaginedthat we were straightaway going to draw up a sort of programmeof disarmament.   As this  did not happen,  it naturally concluded that, directly a marked difference of opinion arose on an essentialquestion limitation of naval material we were  checked all along the line.   This  mistake was perhaps excusable,  but it  was,  none the less, a mistake.  Our task was to  prepare  for a conference for the  reduction and  limitation of armaments in accordance with article  8  of the Covenant (our  Bible,  as the  Japanese delegatesaid  in  other words).   We thought that, in  preparation for  this conference, the important  thing was not to submit  to the council a  lengthy   report  on  the rather  extensive  work of  our  Sub-Commissions, containing replies to the questionnaire submitted tous by the Council with a view to indicating the scope of our work,but to  draw up a  preliminary draft convention.  We  thereforehad to sketch roughly a first text  after mature consideration.  Wehad two drafts before us at the beginning of our discussions.  Itsoon became apparent, in  view  of the problems  we had to  solve,that  it was impossible to draw up a single text, and in  our reportto the Council  and  to  our Governments we have therefore madea  rough draft  which  has only been decided upon provisionallyat the First Beading.  In this draft, we have marked  the points on which  unanimity was  obtained  with or  without reservations,placed side by side the texts on  which agreement had not yetbeen, established, and poted the  statements  and proposals  onwhich unanimity  was not reached  but  which the  delegates  who made them expressly wished to keep until the Second  Beading.   We  thought that,  with the help of  these documents and theMinutes  of our  debates,  our  Governments  would  be  able toexamine all the points raised  during  the  discussion,   and  give them the close study, which is  indispensable if the negotiations and exchange  of views  between  the  various Foreign  Offices  are to result in our drawing up, at the  Second Beading, a single  textwhich may be submitted to.the proposed  Conference.

Sir Austen Chamberlain on March 9, 1928.   .    AT  Lord Cushendun&apos;s  suggestion,  Sir  Austen Chamberlaindiscussed yesterday with M. Briand the disarmament position withreference to the forthcoming meeting of the Preparatory Commissionon the 15th March.    Sir  Austen Chamberlain began by regretting  that on the twocrucial  military and naval questions  the French and British werediametrically opposed.   British  public opinion, with its  traditions,believed that voluntary armies  were defensive and that conscriptarmies  implied offensive  war; whereas he was fully aware that tothe French mind compulsory military service seemed a guarantee ofa pacific policy and a  voluntary army appeared in the  dangerouslight of a Praetorian Guard.  He went on to say that we had beenreconsidering what  we thought  essential from the naval  point ofview,  and he told M. Briand of the modified  proposals* drawn upby  the  Admiralty.  Public opinion realised  that  concessions were necessary from all parties  for a general settlement to be  reached,and if he could point to a concession by the French in naval mattersit would probably acquiesce in his yielding a point on the militaryside.  On the other hand, we could not abandon the British  stand-point  on the question of army reserves unless  we could justify this concession by pointing to a similar concession made to us  in thenaval sphere.  M. Briand asked for a personal copy of the revisedAdmiralty proposals referred to by Sir Austen Chamberlain,  and saidthat he  would put them before the French naval authorities.

I am faced with this difficulty, that I do not knowwhether the Governments which I fervently appealed to more than once at our previous  meetings  to  seek  to reconcile  their differentstandpoints in regard to  certain questions of  primary importance toour. draft Convention have been engaged in conversations or what may have been the result of such conversations.   I shall be gratefulif the representatives  of those Governments are able to give us some information on that matter.

COUNT CLAUZEL (Prance). But while we have been holding the severy interesting political discussions, the technical experts of most ofour delegations have had a certain amount of leisure which they have turned to good account. They have entered into or continued usefulconversations dealing with the treatment of some of these delicatequestions to which I have alluded and for which only partial solutionshad been found; we hope that some final settlement will be reached as speedily as possible.  One of the conditions of such settlement andone of the main conditions of success is an exchange of views  notonly between  technical experts  but between Governments.  I  am glad to say that we are far advanced along this path and there is no occasion to anticipate  any very  long delay before we arrive  atappreciable results.   In these circumstances,  I think that  we should be wrong toneglect such an important, factor of  success.         :                            No.  13.Extract from a  Speech  delivered  by  the Representative  of1 the    United States of America during the Eighth Public  Meeting of    the  Fifth  Session  of  the  Preparatory  Commission,  March  23,    1928.    THE  HON.  HUGH GIBSON  (United  States  of America). Mr. President I had not anticipated speaking in i regard to  thequestion of the  date for our next meeting at the present  moment,but, inasmuch as the  question has  been broached, I feel impelledto rise early in the debate in order to state the views of the American delegation, particularly as I have learned in numerous conversationsthat a considerable amount of misapprehension.exists to the effectthat the American delegation is  determined that  the PreparatoryCommission  shall remain here  to undertake an immediate secondreading.  Various reasons have been advanced for and. against the
undertaking of the second reading, and, to my surprise, a numberof the arguments both for and against have been attributed to mydelegation.  I  cannot but  feel  that  there  should  be only  onedetermining factor and that  other considerations should be entirelysecondary.  After all, the  essential  consideration is to find  andfollow the path leading most directly to general  agreement and tothe  termination of our labours.    At the conclusion of the firstreading, there were so many points of disagreement that we felt that nothing further could be accomplished in public meetings until after an effort had been made by direct negotiation between the various governments and between groups of Governments to find a way,through mutual  concession, to eliminate existing divergences.  Itwas felt that  only after  eliminating  a considerable part  of  the opposing views could we profitably embark upon the second readingwith some prospect of drawing up a document so harmonious and sorepresentative of accepted views as to offer a basis for  calling a finalconference.                            No. 14.Speech  delivered by the Representative of Italy during the Ninth   Public Meeting of the Fifth Session of the Preparatory ,Commis-   sion, March 23, 1928.   GENERAL DE  MARINIS  (Italy). The Italian  delegation is  quite ready to go on to the second reading at once if the majority of theCommission desire to  do  so,  but I must  confess  that  I  do notontertain  any hope  that  the  second reading would produce  moretangible results than the first.  For  this reason I would not advise the Preparatory Commission  to embark&apos; upon the second  readingnow i   If the majority of the Commission consider that the moment hasnot yet  come, I should be prepared: wholeheartedly to  support thejudicious  suggestions put  forward  this  morning by Mr.  Gibson,namely,  that we should postpone our  next  session until there  is some hope of reaching an agreement  and should not risk a repetition of the results of the first  reading.   Mr. Gibson demonstrated veryclearly that, if the Commission.means  to reach  an agreement,  wemust  allow time  for  conversations to  take  place between theGovernments, with a view to eliminating the most salient points  of difference.    Accordingly,  if the Commission is  in favour of  post-postponing the second reading, I see no reason why we should fix anyparticular date or lay down that it is  to be before the next Assembly.We are  always making the mistake  of trying to settle the question a few weeks or a few months earlier. If the Commission thinks  fitto postpone the second reading, it should have complete confidence in the authority and experience of the  President and leave him  to fix the date for it.  I would entreat my colleagues not to regard thisquestion of a date as decisive, but to concern themselves with theresponsibility which we shall  incur when-we  come to the secondreading if we lay ourselves open again to the  possibility  of failure.[18244]                                            o 2

Several honourable  delegates  have  advanced    reasons why that should not be done, and in particular the honour-i    able  delegate  for  Prance, made a  speech just  now  in  which  he    intipiated that  there were a certain number of conversations proceed-    ing which had not yet reached any  actual result,  but  which  he was    hopeful  might  enable progress to be made with these Conventions    at  a later date,  while the honourable delegate for  Italy,  following    him, observed that,  so far as he knew,  there was  no ground he    did not know of  any ground for good hopes that any such  conver-    sations would have a beneficial result.            *            *           *           *           *       But  I am,  of  my own knowledge,  in a  position to say that    Count Clauzel has reason  for the intimation which he has given.

Cependant, - il lui apparait que,  pour  pouvoir etre utilementsoumises a, 1&apos;agrement des autres Puissances navales intefessees en vue  de  la  future reunion de la commission pr6paratoire et  poursauvegarder pleinement les interests dont il a la charge, ces proposi-tions i devraient etre precisees quant a, leurs modalites d&apos;application.   C&apos;est dans cette intention que le  Chef d&apos;Etat-Major general dela  Marine a interroge recemment le Vice-Amiral Kelly,  de passagea Paris,  sur  les conditions, dans lesquelles 1&apos;Amiraute  britanniqueenvisageait  la  mise  en  pratique de  la  methode  de  limitationproposee.   Le Vice-Amiral Vioiette a demande, en particulier, si leGouvernement britannique,  suivant  une methode deja  preconiseepar ses representants, envisageait, pour  la limitation des batimentssous-marins,  la fixation d&apos;un tonnage maximum egal pour toutes lesgrandes Puissances navales, un tel systeme devant avoir eventuelle-ment 1&apos;avantage d&apos;eviter des discussions souvent delicates touchantla  determination  des  besoins  et  de  1&apos;importance  relative  desmarines.   II a  demande egalement si  la  meme methode  pourrait etreappliquee aux croiseurs  dont la limitation est prevue par la note du28  juin,  etant,  d&apos;ailleurs,  entendu  qu&apos;au-dessous du tonnagemaximum theoriquement  autorise,  il y aurait lieu, pour la  Confe-rence du Desarmement, d&apos;enregistrer les chiffres de limitation que,eil pratique,  les hautes parties contractantes prendraient 1&apos;engage-ment de  ne  pas depasser pendant  la  duree  de  la  convention  aintervenir. Une telle procedure aurait en effet 1&apos;avantage de ne pasengager, sur 1&apos;importance relative theorique de eertaines marines,des  debats  dont les consequences  politiques  pourraient  devenirdelicates.  . Enfin,  le Vice-Amiral Violette  a  demande  si,  suivant uneproposition souvent faite par 1&apos;Amiraute britannique, les sous-marinsne ,ponrraient pas  etre  divises en deux  classes, les sous-marinscotiers etant, ainsi que  la delegation japonaise l&apos;a suggere pendant la  Conference navale a trois, exempts de toute limitation en raisonde leur role strictement  defensif.   Le Gouvernement francais a le  ferme espoir que le Goiwerne-ment britannique ne verra pas de difficultes a, completer dans ce sensses propositions; lui-meme pourrait ainsi les accepter dans leurensemble, et  cela permettrait d&apos;eviter k Geneve des debats penibles,plus propres a, augmenter la defiance entre les Puissances qu&apos;a creer1&apos;atmosphere  de confiance  mutuelle  necessaire  a  la limitationgenerale des  armements.

Paris, le  20 juillet 1928.                         (Translation.)   IN his note of the 28th June last, the Marquess of Crewe was goodenough to  inform M.  Briand of the basis on which His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment, with  a view, to reaching agreement  between Franceand Great Britain  so  as  to ensure the  success of  the work  of thePreparatory Commission  of the Conference on  Disarmament, were ready to treat the question of the limitation of naval  armaments.  he added that, if the French Government shared these views, the BritishGovernment for their part would waive their  opposition to the Frenchstandpoint in regard to  the question of &quot; trained reserves.&quot;   The Government of the: Republic shares the view of the BritishGovernment  that, in  the absence  of any  previous  understanding between the two countries, it  would  be  idle  to hope for a succesful issue  of the work  of the Preparatory Commission,  and  so to bringabout a general  limitation  of  armaments.   They have  thereforeexamined in the most  friendly spirit the proposal which the british embassy has been good enough to address to them.   The French Government would certainly have preferred that theBritish  Government should  have taken  into  account  the opinionalready officially or semi-officially expressed by the United  Statesand Japan, and have found it possible to accept the  compromise pro-posed by the  French delegation in March 1927.  They remain con-vinced that if, contrary to their expectation, difficulties still subsist,the examination of this proposal would result in their solution. &apos;  Nevertheless, in view of the declarations  contained in the british note,  of the conciliatory disposition to which these declarations bearwitness and of their anxiety, to bring to the  solution of this question the same goodwill, the French Government, after careful considera-tion, has decided to accept in principle the proposals contained  in theBritish  note of the 28th June...   The French Government, however,  consider, both  in  order to -safeguard the interests for which they are responsible  and also.to ]
enable these proposals to be submitted to the  approval of the othernaval Powers concerned with the greatest advantage, that the methodof their application should be defined.                             -    With this end in  view,. the Chief of Staff of the French Navyrecently  cross-examined  Vice-Admiral Kelly at Paris on the  coh-ditions under which the British Admiralty contemplated the practical application of the  proposed  method  of  limitation.  Vice-AdmiralAlolette  asked in  particular whether the  British  Government,  inaccordance with the method already put forward by their represenfa-tives, projwsed that submarines should be limited by fixing the samemaximum tonnage for all the  great naval Powers, the advantage ofsuch a system being to avoid the  possibility of engaging on  delicatediscussions concerning the relative needs and importance of differentnavies.    He also asked whether the same method could be applied to the cruisers  which fall within  the scope  of  the British note,  it being understood, of course, that the Conference on Disarmament wouldhave  eventually to record,  below  the theoretical maximum tonnageallowed,  the actual figures which in practice the Pligh ContractingParties would undertake not to exceed  for  the duration of theConvention.   Such a procedure  would  have  the  advantage  of avoiding  discussions on the theoretical relative importance of certainnavies which might have unfortunate political consequences.    Finally, Vice-Admiral  Violette  asked  whether, in accordancewith  a proposal  often put   forward  by  the British  Admiralty,submarines could  not be divided into two  classes, coastal submarinesbeing exempt from all limitation  in view Of their  strictly defensivecharacter,  as suggested by the Japanese delegation at the Three-Power Conference.                      ;    The French Government are convinced that the British Govern-ment will find no difficulty in incorporating these suggestions  in their proposals.  If this is  so, the French Government  would  be able  toaccept them as a whole.  This arrangement would have the effect of.avoiding  at Geneva awkward discussions more likely to increase the.existing mistrust between the Powers than to create the atmosphere of mutual confidence essential  to a general  limitation of armaments.    It will  not have escaped the  notice of the  British Government.that the  agreement so earnestly desired on all sides, can only bearfruit if the United States Government, in particular, agree to accept it.   M.  Briand  will be  glad  to know  whether  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment consider  it advisable  to take the necessary steps to thisend at Washington.  For their part  the Government of the Republicwould not  fail to  explain the  reasons for&apos; which, in their desire  toreach  agreement  they thought it their  duty  not to insist  on theadoption  of the  compromise put  forward  in 1927.   They are convinced that the concerted action  of France and Great Britain willenable the two Governments  to  obtain the approval of  the naval powers concerned.   Whatever the  result, and even  should this hope prove illusory,the  two  Governments would,  none the less,  be under the urgentobligation to concert either to  ensure  success by other means or to
adopt a common policy so as to deal with the difficulties which would inevitably  arise  from a check  to  the work  of the PreparatoryCommission.    Paris, July 20, 1928.                            No.  19.              The  Marquess of Crewe to M.  Briand.   His Majesty&apos;s Embassy is  directed by His Majesty&apos;s principal secretary of State  for Foreign  Affairs  to  inform the Ministry forForeign Affairs that His Majesty&apos;s Government highly appreciate the friendly and conciliatory attitude displayed by the  Government of theRepublic in the memorandum addressed to His Majesty&apos;s Embassyby the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the 20th July, respecting thelimitation of naval armaments.   2.  His Majesty&apos;s  Government,  like  the  French  Government,would  have preferred  to see their  own  proposal for compromiseaccepted in the terms  in which they originally made it, and  theycannot but observe that the supplementary proposals suggested inthe French note make very considerable alterations in it.  Neverthe-less  Plis Majesty&apos;s Government, in their  anxious desire  to reachsuch an agreement with France and other Powers as will lead to thesuccessful conclusion of the labours of the Preparatory Commission,and  believing that the proposals now made by the French Govern-ment are of a character to achieve this result,  are prepared to acceptthe supplementary proposals made  in the French note, namely,that an equal maximum tonnage for submarines and cruisers shouldbe fixed for the great naval Powers,  and that  submarines should be divided into two classes, the smaller class being exempt from  alllimitation.   3.  It is, of course, well known to the  French Government thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government are unable to consider this class of vesselas possessing a strictly  defensive character,  but, as  above  stated,they consent in deference to the views of other Powers not to insistfurther on their point  of view.   4.  His Majesty&apos;s  Government are in full agreement with theFrench Government that the assent of the  other great naval  Powersis essential to success, and, as desired by the French Government-,His Majesty&apos;s Government will communicate to the Governments ofthe  United States,  Italy  and  Japan the  compromise which  hasalready received the approval of France and  Great  Britain,  that isto say  :        &apos;&apos; Limitations which the Disarmament Conference will  have   to determine will deal with four classes of warships :        &quot; (1.) Capital ships, i.e., ships of over 10,000 tons or  with    guns of more than 8-inch calibre.       &quot; (2.) Aircraft carriers of over 10,000 tons.
   &quot;(3.) Surface vessels  of  or  below 10,000 tons armed  withguns of more than 6-inch and up to 8-inch calibre.   &quot; (4.) Ocean-going submarines, i.e., over 600 tons.   &apos;&apos; The  Washington  Treaty  regulates limitations in  classes(1) and (2), and the  Disarmament Conference will only have toconsider the method of extending these limitations to Powers non-signatory to this treaty.   &quot; As regards classes (3) and (4), the final Disarmament Con-ference will fix  a  maximum tonnage  applicable to all powers which no Power will  be allowed to exceed for the total of vessels in each of these respective categories  during the period coveredby the  convention.  Within this maximum limit each Power willat the  final  conference  indicate for each of these categories thetonnage they propose to reach and which they undertake not to exceed  during the period covered by the convention.&quot;British Embassy, Paris,     July 28, 1928.                            No.  20.Telegram  to Mr.  Chilton  (Washington), Mr. Dormer  (Tokyo)  and                    Sir R. Graham  (Rome).                                Foreign Office, July 30, 1928.   PBELIMINAEY conversations have been proceeding between  HisMajesty&apos;s  Government  and the French Government  in  the hopeof finding  a basis  for naval limitation, which might prove  generally acceptable, and thus  render fruitful  resumption of discussions inthe Preparatory  Commission  for  the  Disarmament Conference,whose failure to record any progress during the last eighteen months has been  a source of universal disappointment.   To this end thetwo Governments  have agreed to  substantial  modification of  the positions,  which  they  held respectively at the meeting of  theCommission in March 1927, and have worked out proposals on thefollowing  lines which  they  are  themselves ready  to  accept  andwhich they hope  will serve to promote general  agreement.   Limitations which  the Disarmament  Conference will have todetermine will deal with four classes of warships:    (1.)  Capital ships, i.e., ships of over 10,000 tons or with guns          of more than 8-inch calibre.   (2.)  Aircraft carriers of over  10,000 tons.   (3.)  Surface vessels of or below 10,000 tons armed with guns          of more than 6-inch and up  to 8-inch calibre.   (4.)  Ocean-going submarines,  i.e., over 600 tons.   Washington Treaty  regulates  limitations in  classes (1) and (2)and the Disarmament Conference will only have to consider methodof extending  these  limitations to Powers non-signatory to  this treaty.
 .  As regards classes (3) and (4), the final Disarmament conference will  fix a  maximum tonnage applicable  to all Powers which no power would be allowed to  exceed for the total of vessels in eachof  these respective  categories during the period  covered&apos; by  theConvention.  Within this maximum limit each Power will indicateat  final conference for  each of these, categories the tonnage they propose to reach and which they  undertake not to exceed duringthe period covered by the Convention.   Please inform  Government to which  you are accredited  of  theterms of the above  compromise between  hitherto  divergent views and express to them the earnest hope  of Plis Majesty&apos;s Governmentthat  it may prove  acceptable to them. His Majesty&apos;s government believe it  to offer  the best,  if not  the only  prospect of  making an advance from the  present position  and they are confident that  theGovernments of the other principal naval Powers  will  examine it with the utmost sympathy.   It is  important to receive a reply assoon  as  possible  and at all events  before the meeting  of  theAssembly  on the 3rd September.   A similar telegram  is being addressed  to  Tokyo and  Rome/Rome and Washington/Washington  and  Tokyo.                            No. 21.     Extract from a Speech by Sir Austen Chamberlain in the              House of Commons on July 30, 1928.    THEEE is one other question that was raised in connexion withthe  American Treaty on the  Renunciation of War which  I  wouldrather deal with apart.  It is the question  of disarmament.   Nodoubt the signature of the  Kellogg Treaty is a new factor to whichwe  must all pay attention,  and of which we shall take account, butI say I would rather  deal with the matter apart from the Kelloggproposal, because, whether  that treaty was to have been proposed ornot, we should still have been struggling to forward the limitationof armaments.  The right  hon. Gentleman, I think, and  possibly the hon. Member who opened the&apos;Debate also, asked me. what.was going on in the Preparatory Commission.   At the moment thePreparatory Commission on,Disarmament is not  in session, and no definite date  has  been fixed for its  session,  but, as  has beenpublicly  announced,  conversations have  been proceeding between.ourselves and  the French with the hope  of reducing the differencebetween us, indeed, in the hope of finding some compromise uponwhich  we could both  agree:,-: and which we  might then submit  toother Powers,  and  perhaps,  by our proposals, facilitate progress  inthe Committee.  Those conversations have been successful betweenthe French and ourselves,  and I am about to communicate to theother principal naval Powers the compromise  at  which  we havearrived, with the hope that it may be acceptable to them also, andthat thus a great obstacle to progress will have been removed and a
step made.in - advance.  Until those proposals have been communi-cated  to the other Governments,  I do not  like to  say-more-about them.  -I imagine the first serious discussion on them will probablytake place in the Disarmament Committee itself..              -                            No. 22.Telegram [from Sir Horace Rumbold  to  Sir Austen Chamberlain&apos;.

GERMAN Government  seem somewhat disconcerted by news of-Franco-British naval compromise, and fear that it may imply some concession on the  part of His Majesty&apos;s  Government hi-regard tothe question of the limitation of land forces.  Some colour has beenlent  to  this view  by recent  articles  in  the French press  which .attribute far-reaching importance to the compromise.   I propose  to see the Secretary of  State shortly and I presumethat  if he refers to the question  I may refer him to the statement which you recently made in the House of Commons, and point outthat  there is  nothing in the compromise  inconsistent with the locarno treaties.

                            No.  24.   -  Telegram from Lord Cushendun to Mr.  Chilton (Washington).                              Foreign Office, August 10, 1928.   I GATHER that there is a certain amount of misapprehension atWashington as to the exact scope  and purpose of the Anglo-french proposals for the limitation of naval armament..   As  you  are  aware, the  work  of the  League  PreparatoryCommission for the  Disarmament Conference has  broken downlargely as a result of a deadlock  between the British  and Frenchdelegates in regard  to the principle on which the process of navallimitation should be based.   At  the meeting of the  PreparatoryCommission last  March,   the   British  and  French  delegatesannounced  that conversations were taking place  between the twoGovernments which might lead to some arrangement, if time were allowed for the purpose.  The work of the Preparatory  commission has from the  first  been based  on  two  drafts submitted. by  theBritish  and French  Governments respectively,  in  March 1927,His Majesty&apos;s Government advocating the retention of the principleagreed upon  at Washington  of  limitation  by category,  and  theFrench  Government  advocating  the principle  of global  tonnage.The aim has been to reconcile these by producing an  agreed text;which  would necessarily represent a  compromise between  -thedivergent views  expressed  in the rival drafts.   Clearly  the  first step towards such an agreement was to arrive at an accord betweenthe two  Governments  responsible for the  original drafts.-  the compromise telegraphed to you represents  a successful attempt todo this, but we realise that it is no more than the first step whichwe  hope  may  lead  to general   agreement  among  the  Powersrepresented  on the  Preparatory   Commission, enabling  them to draft  an agreed  skeleton convention  (leaving the  figures  blank)for   submission  to  the   Disarmament   Conference.   In   thedivergence  of  views  which appeared  at  the outset  between  theBritish and French  Governments,  the view of the  United states was in principle in agreement with that of Great Britain, and as the compromise now reached with the French goes a  considerable  way towards meeting the views of the United States  and ourselves weentertain the hope that it will  have the approval and support of theAmerican Government.  But we  desire to emphasise the  fact  thatthis Anglo-French agreement is not a treaty or even a final bindingagreement in regard to naval  disarmament.   Unless  it should  leadto the signing  of -an agreed  convention at Geneva, its  purpose willnot have been achieved, and  it will be necessary to make furtherattempts to arrange  a compromise if we are not to abandon all hopeof a limitation of  armaments by international agreement.   This compromise has now  been submitted to the United StatesGovernment in  order  that they may consider its terms  and,  should they see fit, give us the benefit  of their  considered  observationsand of any suggestions which may occur to them.   Premature  publicity in regard to the details of the proposals would clearly  be undesirable.    Both His  Majesty&apos;s  Government
and  the United  States  Government have  been criticised  on  theground that there was insufficient preparation between governments before the  Geneva Naval Limitation  Conference  of: last  year.However this may be,  we consider it very desirable that the  confi-dential  preparatory  conversations which we hope  will  take  place between  the two Governments before the meeting of  the  LeaguePreparatory Commission  at Geneva  should not be  prejudiced&apos; bypremature  publicity.  It seems only  necessary to say to the  press that   conversations  are  taking  place  between  the Governmentsconcerned with a view to the resumption of the work of the Prepara-tory  Commission and that it would be obviously prejudicial to their ultimate success  if  tentative  proposals  are  at every stage  to beprematurely published.   It has been stated in press telegrams that this naval agreementwith  the French represents a bargain,  one part of  which is thatHis  Majesty&apos;s Government agree  to  support the contention of  the prench  Government in  the matter of  military  reserves.     Here,again, there is some misapprehension.  His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave reluctantly reached the conclusion that it  will be impossibleto move the French and the majority of other European Govern-ments from the attitude which they have consistently adopted onthis  question and that, in present conditions,  no  further  progressin regard  to land  disarmament  will be possible  as  long  as thisstumbling-block remains  in  the  way.    They do  not, therefore,propose to  offer any further resistance to the French contention atthe present time.  It is not believed that.any American interest canbe prejudiced by  the  withdrawal of His Majesty&apos;s  Governmentsopposition  on the military reservist question.   An  agreement on land disarmament, even if it is in our view not entirely satisfactory in the matter of  military reservists,  would  represent an importantstage in the general progress of disarmament and would be far  betterthan no  agreement at all.  Moreover, an acceptance of the FrenchGovernmenfs  thesis  on  the  reservists question  will have  theimportant  effect  of  winning the French Government: over to  theBritish  and American side in the matter of the  classification  to beadopted as a basis for naval limitation.   A reply before  3rd September was  suggested  in my telegramof 30th  July because  it was  feared at. that time  that a  meetingof the Preparatory  Commission might be called before  the meetingof the Assembly.   We ourselves  should have much regretted  thepremature summoning of the commission but  might  have beenpowerless to prevent it.  There now seems little further risk of  ameeting being summoned at that time.   In  the circumstances,the  United  States  Government  will  no  doubt  prefer to  deferreplying until there has been time for  a full  consideration of  thenew proposal in  all its  bearings.  It is, of course,  desirable thata meeting  of the Preparatory Commission should not be summoneduntil the Powers principally concerned  have had sufficient timefor reflection.                              .   You  should read this telegram to Mr*  Kellogg at the. earliestpossible opportunity and use the above information  in  order to
correct, by verbal discussion, any misapprehension which you may find  to  exist at the State Department or in other official circlesin regard to the proposals which have been placed before them onthe subject of naval disarmament.

Statement by Lord Cushendun at Geneva,  August 30,  1928.   THERE has been a great deal of speculation and misunderstandingin regard to the so-called  Anglo-French  agreement or accord on naval  disarmament.   The  difficulty  has  arisen  because of  thedifferent meanings of  the word agreement  and because  we have not got  different  words  for  every  sort  of   understanding  between individuals or nations.  This  is not  an  agreement at all  in theordinary sense of the  word,  as applied to international  negotiationsresulting in an accord.  It is not a treaty and it is not final.      :   The matter can best be explained by referring to the way in whichit has arisen. We must start from the setting up of the PreparatoryCommission for  a Disarmament Conference, the purpose  of whichwas  to lay down agreed principles to be followed by all nations in reducing armaments,  whether by land or sea.   This commission began work in March 1927, and as a basis fordiscussion the British and  French Governments each  submitted  adraft  convention.    The  commission  directed  its  endeavours to reconciling  the two drafts  and producing a single agreed  text.There  were several points on which there was, naturally enough,disagreement, but the most important from the British point of view was  the  divergence of opinion between ourselves and  the Frenchregarding the principles on which naval  disarmament  might be approached.   There is no question of  figures or numbers of ships.  That isfor a later stage.  The commission was naturally concerned  withprinciples-a skeleton form  to be filled  in with actual  figures  by  a
subsequent disarmament conference.  . This disagreement betweenthe French and ourselves for a considerable time prevented anythingbeing done.  The other  nations ranged themselves, some on our side and some  on the French, often  substantially, if not exactly,agreeing with one or the other.  In principle the United.  StatesGovernment supported our view rather than that of the Trench.   Various  meetings, of  the. Preparatory Commission  sought a compromise which might produce agreement.  At the meeting last march,  the French  representative  and I announced that certain .conversations had been j)roceeding, both here and in Paris, some-.times between  Ministers and sometimes  between experts,  to  see.whether  these  divergences  could be  surmounted.  Obviously thefirst step in reaching an agreed text  must be agreement between theFrench  and ourselves.  This so-called agreement is  nothing moreor less than a solution of that particular difficulty. But obviouslythis can only be  a  first step.   All the.other nations  concerned  atGeneva  must come  into  the agreement, otherwise the proposed convention falls to the ground.   We  intimated to the American, Italian and Japanese Govern-ments  that these conversations had resulted  in an  agreementbetween the French and ourselves, and invited their observationsupon the text so agreed.  If they are also all in agreement, then wemay hope that the next meeting of the Preparatory Commission will accept  the draft.  If any of them objects,  obviously that, resultwill not be achieved.   It will, of course, be open to the Governmentsconcerned to make suggestions or amendments, or, if their objectiongoes farther than that, it can be met by an amendment to say thatour views are not  acceptable.  If that is so, it only means that so faras  the  Preparatory  Commission is concerned  we shall have  to approach the matter again and see if we can reach accord on someother lines.    The agreement is simply for the  purpose of  securing a singletext as between two draft conventions.   There are only four or fiveshort but very technical  clauses, and  the natural thing is to delaypublication  until  the Governments most concerned  have  had  anopportunity of  considering their replies.  We want  their observa-tions, and I am Very hopeful that when they are  considered by theother Governments,  possibly  with some  amendments, we  maysucceed in arriving at an agreed text.    Speculations as to secret  clauses  and  so forth have no foundationwhatever.  I see  it suggested, for instance, that  we  were going toarrange for pooling our navy with the French. There is  absolutelynothing in any such suggestion, nor is there anything at all in the shape of an agreed policy between ourselves and the French.  It isnot a question of policy.  That has never been  discussed.  There areno secret  clauses  nor any arrangement.as to an alliance or co-opera-tion of navies.  All that  is absolutely.beside  the  mark;  nothing ofthe sort has ever  been suggested.[18244]

Mr.  Houghton to Lord Cushendun.                         United States Embassy,My Lord,                      London, September 28,  1928.   THE  Government  of the  United  States  has received  fromHis  Majesty &apos;s  Government  a  communication  summarising  theunderstanding reached  between the  British  and  the  french governments as  to  a basis of naval limitation, which agreement,it  is  stated,  will,  be   submitted  to. the  next  meeting  of  thePreparatory Commission for. the Disarmament  Conference.
   The Government Of the  United  States  is willing to submitcertain  suggestions  as to  the  basis  -sef  naval  limitation,  as summarised in  the British  note.   From the communication  ofHis Majesty&apos;s  Government it appears that:    The limitations which  the  Disarmament  Conference will  haveto determine will deal with four classes of men-of-war:  (1) capital ships,  that is, ships of over ten thousand  (10,000) tons or  withguns of more  than 8-inch calibre;   (2) aircraft carriers of  overten  thousand  (10,000) tons;  (3)  surface   vessels of  or  belowten thousand  (10,000) tons armed with guns of more  than  6-inchand  up to  8-inch calibre;  (4)  ocean-going  submarines of  oversix hundred (600)  tons.   As  the Washington Treaty  regulates the first  two classes,that  is,   capital  ships and   aircraft carriers,  the  PreparatoryCommission will have  to consider only the  last two categories  sofar as the signatories of that treaty are concerned.   From  the foregoing summary  of  the agreement  it appears thatthe only  classes of naval vessels which it  is proposed to  limitunder the Anglo-French draft agreement are cruisers  of  or belowten thousand  (10,000)  tons armed with guns of more  than  6-inchand  up to 8-inch  calibre, and  submarines  of over six  hundred(600) tons.  The position  of the Government of the United states has been  and now is  that any limitation of  naval armament,  tobe effective,  should apply  to all  classes of  combatant vessels.The  Anglo-French Agreement provides no limitation whatsoever  on6-inch-gun cruisers  or destroyers, or submarines  of six hundred(600) tons or less.   It could not be claimed that the  types of vesselsthus left without limitation are not  highly efficient fighting ships.No one would deny  that modern cruisers  armed with 6-inch guns,or destroyers  similarly armed, have  a  very  high offensive value,especially to any nation possessing well distributed bases in various parts of  the world.  In fact,  such cruisers  constitute  the  largest number of fighting ships now existing in the world.   The limitationof only such surface vessels as are restricted in class 3 of  the  draft agreement, that is, cruisers of or  below ten thousand (10,000) tonsarmed with guns  of more than 6-inch and  up to 8-inch calibre,would  be the  imposition  of restrictions only on types peculiarlysuited to the needs of the United States.  The United States  cannot accept  as a distinct class surface combatant vessels  of  or  belowten thousand  (10,000)  tons armed with guns of more  than 6-inchand up to 8-inch calibre.   It is further clearly apparent that  limita-tion  of this type  only would  add enormously to the  comparativeoffensive power  of a nation possessing a large merchant tonnage  onwhich  preparation may be made in  times of peace for mounting6-inch guns.   At  the Three-Power Conference at Geneva in 1927  the british delegation proposed that cruisers  be  thus  divided into  two classes :those carrying 8-inch guns, and those carrying guns of  6  inches orless in calibre.  They proposed, further, that  8-inch-gun cruisers belimited to a small number or to a small total tonnage limitation,
and that the smaller class of cruisers carrying 6-inch guns  or lessbe permitted a much larger total tonnage, or, what amounts to thesame  thing, to a very large number  of cruisers of this class.  Thelimitation proposed by the British delegation on this smaller class of cruisers was so high that the  American delegation considered it ineffect no limitation at all.  This same proposal is  now presented ina new and even more objectionable  form, which  still limits largecruisers, which are suitable to American needs, but frankly placedno limitation whatever on cruisers carrying guns of 6 inches or lessin calibre.    This proposal is  obviously incompatible  with  theAmerican position at the Three-Power  Conference.   It is  evenmore  unacceptable than the proposal put forward by the british delegation at that conference, not only because it puts the  UnitedStates at a  decided&apos; disadvantage,  but  also  because it discardsaltogether the  principle of limitation  as applied to  importantcombatant types  of vessels.   Much  of what has been said above as  to vessels in  class 3 ofthe Anglo-French Agreement applies with equal  or greater force to class 4.  The  American Government cannot accept as a distinctclass of submarines those of over six hundred  (600) tons, leavingunlimited all  submarines  of  six hundred  (600)  tons  or  under.Six-hundred-ton  submarines  are  formidable  combatant  vessels.They  carry the same  torpedoes as are carried by larger submarines and of equal destructive force within the radius of their operation.They  can also be armed with guns of 5-inch calibre.   The  UnitedStates would  gladly,  in conjunction  with all the nations  of  theworld, abolish the submarine altogether.   If, however, submarinesmust  be continued as instruments of naval warfare, it is the beliefof the  American Government that  they should   be.  limited  to  areasonable tonnage or number.   If there is to be  further  limitation  upon the  construction ofwar vessels so  that  competition  in  this regard  between nationsmay be stopped,  it is the belief of the United States that it should include all classes of combatant vessels,  submarines as well  assurface vessels.   The Government  of  the  United  States  has earnestly andconsistently advocated real reduction   and  limitation  of  navalarmament.  It has given its best efforts towards finding acceptablemethods of attaining this most desirable end.   It would be happy to continue such efforts, but. it  cannot consent to proposals whichwould  leave the  door wide open to  unlimited building of certain types  of  ships of a  highly  efficient  combatant  value and would impose  restrictions only on types peculiarly  suitable  to  Americanneeds.   The American Government seeks  no  special advantage on thesea, but clearly cannot permit itself to  be placed in a position ofmanifest disadvantage.  The American Government feels, further-more,  that the  terms of the Anglo-French Draft Agreement,  in leaving unlimited so large a tonnage  and so many types of vessels,would, actually   tend  to  defeat  the  primary  objective  of anydisarmament  conference &quot;for  the reduction or the limitation  of
armament, in that it would  not eliminate  competition  in navalarmament and would not effect  economy.  For all these reasons the Government of the  United States  feels that no useful purpose would be  served by accepting as a basis of  discussion the Anglo-French proposal.   The American  Government has no objection to any agreementbetween Great Britain and France which those countries think willbe to their advantage and in the interest of limitation of armament,but naturally  cannot  consent that such  an  agreement should beapplied to the  United  States.   In order to make quite clear that, in declining  to adopt theAnglo-French  Agreement as a basis  for discussion of naval limita-tion, it seems appropriate briefly to review the attitude of the UnitedStates regarding the  methods of limitation in order  to show  thatthe  American  Government  ha6 consistently  favoured  a drasticproportional limitation.  The success of the Washington conference is known to  all.  It strictly limited all  combatant ships and aircraft carriers of over ten thousand (10,000) tons. In order to bring aboutsuch limitation the American  Government made great sacrifices inthe curtailment of  plans of building and in the actual destruction ofships already built.    At  the first  session of  the  PreparatoryConference the  American Government submitted proposals whichwere consistently adhered to at subsequent meetings :  (1) That thetotal tonnage allowed in  each class of combatant vessel be prescribed ;(2) that the maximum tonnage of a unit and the maximum calibreof gun allowed for  each class be prescribed; (8) that, so long as thetotal tonnage  allowed to each  class  is  not  exceeded, the  actualnumber of  units  may  be left  to  the discretion  of  each  Powerconcerned.   Within this general  plan the  American proposal at the geneva conference was, for the United  States and the British Empire, atotal tonnage limitation in the cruiser class of  from two hundred and fifty thousand (250,000) to three  hundred thousand (300,000) tons,and for Japan, from  one  hundred and fifty  thousand (150,000) toone hundred and  eighty thousand  (180,000).   For  the  destroyerclass, for the United States  and the British  Empire,  from two hundred  thousand (200,000)  to  two  hundred and  fifty  thousand(250,000), and for Japan, from one hundred and twenty thousand(120,000)  to one hundred and fifty thousand (150,000)&apos;tons.  Forthe submarine class, for the United States and the British Empire,sixty thousand (60,000) to ninety thousand  (90,000)  tons,  and for japan, thirty-six thousand (36,000)  to fifty-four thousand (54,000)tons.  It was further stated by the American  delegation that, if any power  represented felt  justified  in  proposing still  lower tonnagelevels for  auxiliary craft, the American Government would welcome such proposal.   The purpose  of these proposals was that there might be no corn-petition between the three Powers in the building of naval armament,that their respective navies should be maintained at the lowest levelcompatible with  national security and should  not be of the size and character  to warrant the suspicion of aggressive intent, and, finally,
that a wise economy dictates that further naval construction be kept to a minimum.    The Government of the United States remains willing to use its best efforts to obtain a basis of further naval limitation satisfactory to all the naval Powers, including those not represented at the Three-Power Conference at Geneva, and is willing to take into consideration in any conference the special needs of France, Italy or  any othernaval Power for the particular class of  vessels deemed by them mostsuitable for their defence.  This could be accomplished by permittingany of the Powers to vary the percentage of tonnage in classes withinthe total tonnage, a certain  percentage to be agreed upon.  If therewas an increase in one class  of vessels it should be deducted from thetonnage  to be used in other classes.   A proposal along these linesmade by Great Britain and  discussed  by the  American and british representatives would be sympathetically considered by the  UnitedStates.  It expects on the part of others, however, similar  considera-tion for its own needs.  Unfortunately,  the Anglo-French Agreementappears  to  fulfil none of the  conditions which  to  the  AmericanGovernment  seem vital.   It leaves unlimited a very large class of effective  fighting ships, and  this very fact would inevitably lead to a recrudescence of naval competition disastrous to national economy.

Telegram, from Mr. &apos;Dormer (Tokyo), September 29, 1928.FOLLOWING is text of Japanese reply : &quot; Sir,   &apos;&apos; I have  the honour to  acknowledge receipt of your note of2nd August,  informing me  that as a result of preliminary  con-versations  between  Plis  Majesty&apos;s  Government  and  FrenchGovernment  they  have agreed  to modify substantially positionswhich their respective Governments held at meeting of Leagueof Nations Preparatory  Committee on Disarmament of March1927, and have worked out proposals on the following lines, whichthey are themselves ready  to accept and  which they hope will contribute to the promotion  of general agreement.   In informingImperial Japanese Government of  these proposals,  you enquire-their views in regard to    &quot; (a.)  Limitations  to  be determined by  Disarmament Con-ference will relate to four classes of men-of-war : (1) capital ships,i.e.,  ships over 10,000 tons displacement or with guns  of morethan 8-inch calibre; (2) aircraft carriers of over 10,000 tons; (8)surface vessels below 10,000 tons with guns of more than 6-inchor up to 8-inch calibre; (4) ocean-going submarines, i.e., of over600 tons.
    &quot; (b.)  As Washington Conference regulates limitation of ships in category one and  two,  disarmament conference  will merelyhave to consider method of extending these limitations to Powersnon-signatory to that  treaty.   j    &quot; (c.)  His Majesty&apos;s Government  and French Governmentmake the  following proposals :       Firstly,  as regards  classes 3  and 4,  final DisarmamentConference  shall fix  the  maximum  tonnage applicable  to allPowers which no Power will be permitted to  exceed for  the totalof vessels  in each of the respective categories during the  period covered by convention.    &quot;Secondly, at final conference for  limiting  these categorieseach Power will indicate the tonnage which they  propose to reachwithin the limit referred to in the preceding  paragraph, and whichthey undertake not to exceed during the period covered by theconvention.    &apos;&apos; It has always been the  consistent policy  of the JapaneseGovernment to spare no effort for the  Conclusion of  a  just and fair agreement on limitation of armaments,  and as the formula for restriction  of naval armament, with regard to which an agree-ment has been now  arrived  at between Great Britain and France,successfully reconciles  the discrepancies  between theory  and practice existing in various proposals put  forward hitherto, theImperial Government expresses its concurrence to the purport ofthe present agreement.   &apos;&apos; In view of the fact, however, that maximum tonnage of largecruisers and  submarines to  be  applied indiscriminately  to allcountries must, from the point of view of national security  and ofalleviation of the burden on the people, be satisfactory to various countries  whose circumstances  are  different, the   ImperialGovernment considers agreement in question needs to  be most carefully drawn up  and  just.                          &apos;&apos; I avail, &amp;c.                                  &quot; G. TANAKA, Baron,                             &apos;&apos; Minister for Foreign Affairs.&apos;&apos;
