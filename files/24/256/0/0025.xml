(THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) .COPY NO.    %1SECRET.CP. 165 ( 55) .CABINET. INDIA.Appreciation of the Political Situation, by the Government of India,  dated 16th August, 1935.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential appreciation of the Political Situation in India,  dated the 16th August, 1935, issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.1. The dispute between the Sikhs and Muslims in Lahorementioned in Paragraph 2 of the last appreciation,  dated 15th July, 1935,  developed into a very serious anti-Government agitation by the Muslims, and overshadows other events of the month.    Up till July 18th, some slight hope remained that a settlement might be reached as a result of the discussions between the two parties and of the constant pressure exerted by His Excellency the Governor and his officers on the leaders of both communities to use their influence on the side of peace and moderation.    But the situation took a serious turn for the worse on July 19th, when some Muslim agitators,  in defiance of the order prohibiting public meetings, worked a Muslim crowd into a state of frenzy by means of violent speeches.    This led almost immediately to a clash with the police, and was the prelude to two days of very acute anxiety, during which the authorities were not in complete control of the city.    Huge and extremely truculent crowds collected and for a time the Central Police Station was practically in a state of siege. Repeated attempts to disperse the crowds without the use of firearms failed,  and the authorities were forced to call on troops to fire twice on 20th July &apos;and eight times on 21st July.    Only twenty-three rounds in all were fired.Exact casualties are not known, but not more than 12 persons are believed to have been killed.    Casualties, mostly of a minor nature, were numerous among the police and military. As a precaution, extra armed police were brought into Lahore from other provinces,  and all British troops in the Punjab were moved from the hills to their stations in the plains.    These movements, together with reinforcements of the Lahore Garrison by additional troops,  including one regiment of Indian cavalry,   and the firm
2.action taken by the authorities to disperse the crowds on the 20th and 2ist July convinced the law-breakers that the Government were determined to use all necessary force to suppress the agitation and,as a result, they did not reassemble on 22nd July and the authorities rapidly regained complete control of the situation.    No further acts of violence have occurred and, except for the fact that the Sikh temple, which is the origin of all the trouble,  is still guarded by police,   the situation is now practically normal.    But much bitterness remains.This is directed partly against the Sikhs and partly against the Government who are alleged to have sided with the Sikhs and allowed the mosque to have been demolished under the protection of British bayonets.    But there is also much ill-: feeling within the Muslim community which is especially directed against the Ahrars, a section of the community which held aloof from the agitation and even condemned it as ill-advised.   Attempts are now being made to have those killed recognised as martyrs and commemorated in a suitable form. The usual demand for an impartial enquiry has also been made. Repercussions outside Lahore have been unimportant,   except in one or two centres, though there is considerable tension in most districts of the Punjab.    Coming as it has done on the eve of the constitutional change, which will place a responsible Ministry in the position of having to maintain law and order, this incident has caused a profound apprehension among the more thoughtful persons of all communities in Lahore. The most disturbing features of the agitation have been the complete failure of the reputed leaders to control the more extreme elements in both communities, and the evidence of the rapidity with which communal feeling may give rise to a situation in which the whole existence of the constituted authority is threatened..
2. The Working Committee of the All-India Congress met at Wardha in the Central Provinces at the end of July.    This place was undoubtedly selected because it is the present place of residence of Mr. Gandhi.    The choice of meeting place,  the long discussions which took place between Mr. Gandhi and leading members of the ebmniittee e.nd the exposition of his views to the Committee,   form an interesting commentary on Mr. Gandhi&apos;s claim that he has given up politics and is now devoting all his energies to social work.    That he is still the most powerful influence in Congress politics is a fact about which there is little room for doubt.3. The most important question discussed in the Committeewas whether the Congress Party should accept of flee in the new-Provincial Governments,    The subject had previously received prominence from statements made by Mr. Satyamurti, the Secretary of the Congress Party, in the Legislative Assembly and one of the Congress Leaders in Madras, and also from a manifesto 1 issued by Doctor Ansari and Mr.B.C.Roy,  Congress leaders in Delhi and! Bengal,  and others rtin favour of acceptance,.    Messrs. Satyamurti and Bhulabhai Desai, the latter the leader    of the Congress Party in the Legislative Assembly,, strongly urged the case in favour of acceptance,  which was equally strongly opposed by the left wing elements in the Committee.    Babu Rajendra Prasad, President of the Congress, expressed the view that&apos;:&quot;th.e best course was to support parties prepared to accept a Congress mandate and to carry out Congress policy by obstruction after taking office.Largely owing to the influence of Mr. Gandhi,  the Committee decided that it would be premature to print any decision in the matter at present and that it should be left for further consideration by the All-India Congress Committee
*j *t O&amp; d 6which will meet in Madras in October and for final decision in the full session of Congress at Lucknow in February.    There is every indication that Mr. Gandhi will oppose acceptance of office on the ground that no impediments should be placed in the way of a fresh attempt to gain by direct action much more drastic constitutional changes.    No such attempt need, however,  be anticipated unless and until he succeeds in developing an effective village organisation,  a matter to which his immediate energies are directed. 4.       The decision of the Committee is, no doubt,  in the interests of the unity of Congress, since opinion on the subject is so sharply divided and the elements on both sides are so strong that a definite decision one way or the other at the present moment would almost certainly result in a split in the party.    Interesting points that emerged during the course of the discussion were that Congress leaders are not too sanguine that the elections will give them clear majorities  in the new Legislatures and that they recognise that the new Constitution has been so framed as to reduce to a minimum the danger of a breakdown as a result  of obstruction from within the Cabinet.. 5. In addressing a police parade on July 11th atDacca, His Excellency Sir J. Anderson, Governor of Bengal, explained the present position in regard to terrorism, in that province .   While-the position today is a good deal better than it was two or three years ago &quot;the terrorist virus is still active and malignant&quot; and an unfavourable&apos; feature is that there is still so much fresh activity after most of the leaders have been placed under restraint.    The marked decrease in terrorist crime is apt to give a wrong impression of the situation because the public hear nothing of the conspiracies which are unearthed and the outrages which are prevented by the constant
5.pressure and alertness of the police.    At the same time the Government have during the last two years been able to release a considerable number of detenus and to relax the restrictions on, and to move to village or home domicile, many more.    They&apos;are now, as an experiment, removing greater numbers to home domicile where responsible committees of non-officials are willing to exercise superintendence over them, and are also releasing others on bonds for good behaviour executed by detenus and on the security of the parents or guardians. His Excellency welcomes the appreciation throughout the Province of the fact that the terrorist menace is not merely to the Government of today but to the whole future welfare of the Province, but he pointed out that that attitude must harden into a practical determination to show definitely, by deed as well as by word, that the terrorist is regarded as a public enemy. 6. It is too early yet to roviev; the reactions of thePress to the passage of the Government of India Act.    This subject will be dealt with in the next appreciation.
