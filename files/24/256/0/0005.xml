This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. ^Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence, March, 1935SECRET.208-A   , Copy No. \ 3 9COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCEREMOVAL OF THE ROYAL ORDNANCE FACTORIESMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. It is noted in the conclusions of the 264th Meeting of the Committee of      70 Imperial Defence that the question of the transfer of the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich   General to other localities, which had been raised in Lord Weir&apos;s Memorandum on War     8189 Emergency Preparations (C.I.D. Paper 1138 B), was under examination by the War Office, who would bring the matter forward in due course.2. The question has been investigated by an inter-services committee under the Chairmanship of the Financial Secretary of the War Office, and a copy of their report is attached hereto. It will be noted that by their terms of reference they were directed to consider the removal, not only of Woolwich Arsenal, but also of the other Royal Ordnance Factories near London, viz., the Royal Small Arms Factory at Enfield and the Royal Gunpowder Factory at Waltham.3. The Committee recommend the removal to safer districts of the Royal Filling Factory (Woolwich), the Royal Gunpowder Factory (Waltham) and the Royal Gun Factory (Woolwich), and stress the desirability of the removal of the first two as early as possible.4. It will be observed that in selecting the new sites for the factories the Committee have not overlooked the claims of the distressed areas, but the recommenda-tions, with which the Army Council agree, are naturally governed by the conditions of security and considerations such as transport facilities and proximity to sources of supply of materials and labour.5. The Army Council agree, on the information before them, in the view that the risks attendant on leaving these factories in their present locations outweigh the disadvantages of breaking up the present centralized organization. They therefore accept the main findings of the Committee, but their acceptance is dependent on the basic assumptions of the Committee as to the conditions of security being authoritatively confirmed by the Committee of Imperial Defence.6. There is also the very difficult question of the provision for the cost of removal which, for the three factories concerned, is estimated by the Committee at nearly  7,000,000, excluding the cost of sites and any housing programmes that might be necessary. The Army Estimates are already at the lowest possible figure, and it is not practicable for the Army Council to effect any reduction in the funds provided for the maintenance of the Army in order to meet this expenditure.7. I therefore remit the Report to the Committee of Imperial Defence for consideration in particular of these aspects of security and finance.8. There are certain subsidiary matters arising out of the Report, such as the disposal of the explosives at present held at Woolwich surplus to the needs of the Filling Factory, and measures for increasing the output capacity of the trade Explosives
Factory at Ardeer, which are under the consideration of the Army Council. And I wish to draw the attention of the Committee of Imperial Defence to the remarks in paragraph 17 of the Report concerning the vulnerability of the plant of the Imperial Chemical Industries at Billingham.9. The War Office have also under consideration the re-conditioning of the reserve factory at Birtley, five miles south of Newcastle-on-Tyne ; this factory is for the supplementary output of Shell Cartridge Cases (empty). (See paragraph 21 of the Report.) In view of the fact that there will be no explosives at this factory the Army Council are prepared to accept the risk of the locality rather than incur the extra expenditure of erection of a building elsewhere. The Army Council ask whether the Committee of Imperial Defence concur in this view.H.The Wab Office,22nd March, 1935.

report. The Woolwich Arsenal area.Woolwich Arsenal occupies an area of 1,308 acres with a river frontage of 31- miles, bounded on the Eastern and Southern sides by the London County Council main drainage embankment. The &quot;Western end of the area consists of manufacturing shops, stores, &amp;c.; the centre, of proof butts, ranges and magazines for high explosives ; and the Eastern end, of military and naval stores and other magazines. Within the area there are a number of establishments, the principal being : 	Peace.		War.	Number of employees.	Annual Cost.(a) (approx.)

The Experimental Establishment  at   Shoeburyness  ( 121,000) is -closely linked with the Arsenal Establishments.2. McKinnon Wood Committee.At the end of the war, the question of retaining the Arsenal at Woolwich was referred by the Ministry of Munitions to an inter-departmental Committee the McKinnon Wood Committee. There were then a large number of National Factories in being. This Committee recommended in their 2nd report (22nd November, 1918) that the location of the Grovernment Arsenal in peace should be -continued at Woolwich.
As regards the danger of air attack they said : &quot; The arsenal situated in the South and East of the country is generally assumed to be more open to aerial attack than in the North and West; but, looking ahead, in a few years as the radius of bombing machines grow, all parts of the country will be almost equally open to foreign aerial attack. Moreover, Woolwich must be looked upon mainly as a peace producing arsenal and at the outside only capable of producing a very small percentage of the total armament requirements for a serious war.&quot;They went on to say -&quot; Had, however, the retention of a large arsenal been contem-plated in all probability we should have recommended a considerable section being located elsewhere than at Woolwich but in the case of an establishment of such size as we consider will be required we have come to the conclusion that Woolwich is the natural and most convenient place for such an arsenal. In arriving at this decision we have been guided by five considerations : (1) At Woolwich there already exists manufacturing capacity and experimental facilities for practically all classes of war material.(2) No individual national factory possesses the plant for manufacture of all classes of armament, nor could any be adapted without an expense probably far in excess of the sum necessary to effect a re-organization of the lay-out at Woolwich.(3) The close proximity of Woolwich to Government depart-ments in London and also the main experimental estab-lishment of the Ordnance Committee and Shoeburyness presents advantages which factories further afield would not possess. It is generally agreed that experimental manufacture is largely valueless unless it is associated with manufacture on a supply scale. If therefore,. \V oolwich is the most suitable locality for experimental work it also follows that the Government factory should be located in the same place.(4) Certain topographical features and facilities make Shoebury-ness a unique range for long distance firing. No other such site is readily available. As the arsenal engaged on experimental manufacturing should be near the trial grounds its location must be in the vicinity of London..(5) (Related to a temporary post-war local labour problem).&quot;At the - same time the Committee drew special attention to the danger attendant upon filling operations and the storage of explosives and filled stores in the Arsenal, and recommended &quot; that Woolwich should cease to be used as a storage depot for completed ammunition and finished stores all stores not required by the factory and especially filled ammunition to be removed as soon as possible.&quot;
3. Stevenson Committee.The question of transferring the Arsenal elsewhere was again considered in 1922 by the Stevenson Committee, having regard to new factors since 1918, such as the liability to attack from the air, alterations in the manufacturing conditions in industry and the existence of a number of National Factories still unsold at that date.The Committee made no formal report. Two memoranda were prepared for the Committee by the General Staff and the Air Staff respectively on the air danger. These memoranda were referred to the Committee of Imperial Defence, whose conclusions were as follows : &apos;; (i) That the uninterrupted supply of munitions upon the outbreak of war is the first essential. In view of the considered opinion of the Air Staff that the Royal Arsenal, if retained at Woolwich, &apos; will cease to fulfil any useful function on the outbreak of war with a continental power,&apos; dependence on Woolwich for essential supplies is dangerous from a military point of view.(ii) That the danger of war with a continental power within striking distance of Woolwich Arsenal is not sufficiently imminent to justify precipitate action involving immediate expense and dislocation of industry.(hi) That in view of the increasing range of aircraft it is desirable as a general principle to avoid dependence on any single and concentrated arsenal.&quot;In view of these conclusions the Secretary of State decided that the Committee should be dissolved.4. Existing Factories, fyc.The present position is that the three pre-war factories at Woolwich, Enfield and Waltham have been retained, and of the war factories there have been retained as reserve factories under the control of the Director of Ordnance Factories, the rilling factory at. Hereford ; the cartridge case factory (18-pr. and 4-5-inch) at Birtley (near Newcastle); and certain facilities for explosives at Irvine (Ayrshire), and for small arms ammunition at Blackpole (Worcester-shire). Practically all peace filling work is still continued at Woolwich.5. &quot; Reasonably safe areas &quot;.The terms of reference to the present Committee indicate that it must be accepted that Woolwich Arsenal is vulnerable. The Committee have therefore not considered it as within their province to inquire what protection will be given to other activities on the Thames or in London, which may, or may not, be equally vital to the defence of the country, and to what extent such protection would automatically serve to defend the Arsenal area. They note, however, that no such indication of vulnerability is expressed in the case of the factories at Enfield and Waltham, but as these factories are situated near London
their vulnerability to air attack during war has been assumed. The Committee accordingly invited the General Staff and the Air Staff to advise them what areas of Great Britain can be regarded as compara-tively safe from air attack, and what degree of dispersion of the Arsenal activities within those areas would be necessary.6. Two documents (appended) have been prepared at the request of the Committee, and we have had the advantage of the explanations of the two officers on the Committee representing the two Staffs. As a result of the advice which we have received we accept the position that the only areas which could be considered suitable and reasonably safe are those in south-west Scotland (including Renfrewshire), the west of Cumberland, Westmorland and Wales, though as regards Wales, having regard to the possibility of attack from any part of the continent, it would be preferable to exclude the more southerly parts. In view of the probably increasing range of aircraft no guarantee of safety from damage can be given for any area if the enemy single it out for a determined attack. In this connection we recognize that in the main the industrial activities of the country lie in an area not regarded as reasonably safe in the sense above, and it is on these-activities that we shall largely rely for munitions in time of war.7. General considerations regarding dispersal.It is clear that the probability of air attack on any particular factory would be reduced by the dispersion into smaller units of the activities now congregated in the Arsenal area, and, in general, by siting them as far north and west as possible. Such dispersion would assure a greater degree of certainty of. supply during the early stages of war, not only in the smaller chance of damage but also in the greater freedom from stoppages owing to air warnings. Other factors of importance, however, have to be considered -the cost of moving the factories ; the increased difficulties and increased cost of administra-tion in peace of a number of isolated factories ; the difficulties of finding within districts, which are largely non-industrial, sites with good transport facilities and an adequate supply of work people, large numbers of whom will be required at very short notice in an emergency ; and finally a certain loss of efficiency in the development of new types of munitions or new methods of manufacture which may follow if the present centralized organization at Woolwich is broken up.8. Factories within the Arsenal.The removal of the Arsenal as a whole to a single new site is not a proposal which can, we think, be seriously entertained. It would continue to offer a large and attractive target, and there would be insuperable difficulties in finding a site within the limited areas which are regarded as reasonably safe, and where the large number of employees required in an emergency could be found rapidly. We have therefore directed our attention to the separate activities at Woolwich with a view to their possible dispersal. The Arsenal shops can be grouped into six factories ; against these we show the numbers of employees necessary in peace in a dispersed state (assuming that
peace orders are as at present), and the numbers estimated to be-required in an emergency.-	Peace.	Emergency.Royal Grim Factory	660	3,330Royal Carriage Factory   ...       ...       ...	2,065	7,330Royal Ammunition Factory Small Arm Ammunition		and Quick Firing Cartridge Factory ...	930(a)	8.665(a)Fuze Factory       ...      ...      ...      ...      ...	1,400	6,265Projectile and Bomb Factory	1,130	5,065Royal Filling Factory	1,200	23,500(a) includes filling of Small Arm Ammunition9. In considering the possibility of dispersing these activities we have borne in mind four main considerations (i) the damage which may be expected to arise from the nature and location of each factory as the result of an attack, and the effect of raids and warnings of raids on the output of the factory consequent on the interruptions of work;(ii) the extent to which reliance is placed by the Services on theoutput  of each factory  in the first 12 months of war ;(iii) the extent to which any one factory&apos;s activities are interlockedwith those of other factories and departments in the Arsenal area ;(iv) the cost of removal to a safer site.We have not considered it necessary in the short time at our disposal to attempt any estimate of how the cost of peace administra-tion would be affected by removal. A new factory designed on modern lines would enable savings to be made and some savings may, or may not, arise in wages and material depending on local circumstances. On the other hand increased cost would arise from the unadvoidable duplication of staff and plant; but any such variations in cost would be almost negligible in comparison with the cost of removal.The Filling Factory, Woolwich10. This factory is engaged in filling shell, bombs, torpedo war heads,. &amp;c, with high explosive charges ; cartridges with cordite ; fuzes and pyrotechnics with special compositions, &amp;c. The materials required for filling are drawn from working stocks held in magazines in the area under Navy and Army control and the filled products are-returned to Navy and Army stores within the area, pending transfer to their final destination. The amount of explosive material held in about 90 magazines, &amp;c, in that area in November, 1934, amounted to 3,600 tons, the great bulk of which was cordite.   At the Armistice^(8601)b
&apos;(Noveniber, 1918) the amount was over 10,000 tons of which over 3,000 tons were high explosive materials. While every precaution is taken by way of mounding and other protection to localise the effects of explosions we feel very strongly that the presence of the large quantities of explosive material which are unavoidable in war is a risk which should not be taken in such an important manufacturing centre as the Arsenal or in such a densely populated area. We feel moreover that the presence of this stock of explosives would be a special attraction to an enemy.11. The filling factory at Woolwich is not the only filling factory available. There is a reserve factory at Hereford for filling high -explosives, and certain capacity at Admiralty establishments. The Hereford factory was built for certain classes of filling only and is required to supplement the Woolwich factories. There is practically no filling capacity in the trade. In the last war the increased demands for filling were met mainly by construction of National Filling Factories and not by reliance on the trade. The Services are at present vitally dependent on the filling capacity which now exists at Woolwich.12. The filling work at Woolwich could be readily separated off from the other activities there. Assuming that the other activities remain at Woolwich, it woidd be necessary to retain there, in close association with the Design and Research Departments, filling capacity on a small manufacturing scale in order that the experimental side of the work could conveniently be continued. The work of filling Small Arms Ammunition with cordite is so intimately linked with the manufacture of the case and bullet that it would be necessary to retain that work as part of the ammunition factories. These two reserva-tions would not require any large quantity of explosives to be held in the area.13. Cost of removal.It is estimated that to remove and reprovide the existing capacity, for filling, inspection and magazines, and a certain amount of storage for filled ammunition, &amp;c, necessary to enable the factory to operate as an independent unit, would require a working area of 400 acres ap-proximately and would cost about  2,100,000. We are informed that the Admiralty would wish to provide for certain of this filling capacity in Admiralty establishments and if this were approved the above estimate of cost would be reduced. This sum excludes the cost of the site and any housing programme or special provision for transport that may be necessary for the operatives. In addition there would be some expense estimated at  20,000 in re-arranging the facilities to be left at Woolwich for the small scale plant. We also draw attention to the fact that the storage accommodation at Woolwich for ammunition is greater than that needed by the Filling Factory, and if this excess were reprovided it would cost about  280,000, but the provision and location of such storage is a matter for the separate Services. The removal would release for sale some 450 acres of land at the eastern -end of the Arsenal, if certain quarters and Naval stores, were removed and a wall one mile long built.
We note that the Mensforth Committee which reported in 1921 on-the possibility of releasing land, &amp;c, at Woolwich, estimated that the highest value likely to be realized at that date for 240 acres which formed part of the above 450 acres was  60,000, but within the time at our disposal we have been unable to obtain an estimate of present value.14. Proposed site.In the selection of a locality for a new Filling Factory we have given special consideration to the four depressed areas which have recently been the subject of a special investigation. For the defence reasons referred to in paragraph 6 above, the areas of Durham and Tyneside and South Wales are unsuitable, and in selecting a locality within the reasonably safe area we have felt obliged to have regard to-good transport facilities. The transport in and out of the Filling Factories in war will amount to about 1,000 tons a day each way ; the empty shell will come from the Midlands and the North; the high explosives from the North; the cordite from Holton Heath and Waltham in the South, if the Royal Gunpowder Factory remains in its present situation. Moreover the factory will require large numbers of employees to be taken on rapidly in war. For one or both of these reasons neither the depressed area of Scotland, nor that of West Cumberland is as suitable for a new Filling Factory, to replace that at Woolwich, as a district nearer the Midlands, and we have therefore very reluctantly felt obliged to rule out these two depressed areas as well. We consider that the locality of OSWESTRY which lies close to the border of Wales would be the most suitable. This district would be well situated for the delivery of empty shell and reasonably convenient for the delivery of high explosives and cordite. The advantage of the river frontage at Woolwich would of course be lost but, if a site were found on the Shropshire Union Canal, water transport would be available, as well as good rail and road transport.15. The labour problem.The labour problem of obtaining some 23,000 employees rapidly in war for the Filling Factory will undoubtedly be a serious matter, as the large labour pool of London with its unrivalled transport facilities will no longer be at hand, but to the north of Oswestry, there are the colliery districts of St. Martin&apos;s, Chirk, Ruabon and Wrexham with a population density transitional between close rural&quot; and &quot;semi-urban &quot;.. In order to avoid undue housing expense it would be necessary to arrange in an emergency for a system of road and rail transport. We note that in the case of the cordite factory built at Gretna in the war which employed about the same number of workpeople it was necessary to build townships which added very greatly to the expense. Gretna,. however, about 8 miles from Carlisle, was in a thinly populated area. We have not thought it to be within our terms of reference to consider the effect on labour conditions at Woolwich if the Filling Factory were removed from the Arsenal, but we remark that a certain number of key men would have to be transferred to the new factory and also a. river front site would be set free at Woolwich, which might attract other industries.(8601)
16. The extent of the existing capacity to be reprovided.We have considered the extent to which the filling capacity that -now exists at Woolwich should be reprovided in the construction of a new filling factory. We have been informed that, on the basis of the present manufacturing capacity, the supply of materials (cordite in particular) in the first twelve months of war may not be sufficient to employ fully the existing filling capacity ; on the other hand there are other factors to be considered such as the availability of reserves, imports, and increases in the manufacturing capacity. We do not feel therefore that we are in a position to make a recommendation in the matter but suggest that the point should be specially examined if and when steps are taken to move the Filling Factory. The estimate of cost in paragraph 13 is as there stated on the basis of reproviding the existing capacity.17. Billingham.In the course of our inquiries into the location in war of the factories from which the explosives and empty shell would reach the filling factory, we were informed that the filling factories would be very largely dependent on the plant of the Imperial Chemical Industries at Billingham for the ammonium nitrate required for high explosives, and also, that explosive factories would be mainly dependent on that same plant for nitric acid without which explosives cannot be made. Billingham is situated on the Tees near Hnrtlepool and is not within the reasonably safe area. The question of the trade supplies of explosives does not fall within our terms of reference and we understand that the Supply Board are aware of the risks of relying so largely on Billingham. We feel, however, that we should call attention to the point as it is difficult to justify expensive measures to remove the filling factories if no steps are taken either to secure the provision of the basic nitrogen compounds or to create adequate reserves.The Gun and Carriage and Ammunition Factories18. These three factories are engaged on engineering work and have no explosive risks apart from the negligible risk in connection with filling small arm ammunition, referred to above. They consist of a large number of buildings widely spaced over the western portion of the Arsenal area. The damage that would be caused by high explosive and incendiary bombs would be local and its seriousness would depend on the particular machines or plant hit. Apart, however, from actual damage the output of the factories would be affected by stoppages of work due to both air raids and warnings and also by the persistent effects of gas bombs. Employees at Woolwich who had experienced air raids in the last war expressed the opinion that work would not be seriously interrupted by warnings or even by actual raids unless direct hits occurred. We cannot, however, express any opinion as to what extent output would be reduced on this account in the first 12 months of a future war, and we can only record, for what it is worth, that in
September, 1917, there were seven raids up the Thames during a period of 9 days and in that period work was stopped at the Arsenal for a total of 21 hours, the output during the period being reduced by about 15 per cent. The experience, however, of the last war cannot be taken as a reliable guide as to what might happen in a future war ; particularly if one of the early raids seriously damaged the Arsenal. Although the removal of the Filling Factory and the associated stocks of explosives from the Arsenal will make that area a much less attractive target the frequency of warnings may not be affected owing to the numerous important objectives in the London area.19. Reliance on Woolwich engineering factories in tear.We have been furnished with a statement showing that the output of stores, with certain exceptions, made by these three Woolwich factories in the first 12 months of war bears a small proportion to the total requirements of the services in that period. In the very early months of the war, however, we would have to rely on the Arsenal for the required production as there would be practically no output from ordinary industry. The main exceptions referred to above are the naval guns and the large cartridge cases required by the Navy for anti-aircraft ammunition and certain types of naval fuzes. Moreover, engineering products differ from filling work, in that there is in general some alternative source of supply in the industry of the country so that with the exceptions mentioned there is not the same vital necessity to remove these factories to a safer area.20. TAe Gun Factory and naval guns.The Admiralty would depend on the Gun Factory for 40 per cent, of their heavy naval guns in the first 12 months of war and conversely the Gun Factory is very largely dependent in peace on the orders for naval guns. The Admiralty representative has expressed strongly the necessity from a naval point of view of moving the Gun Factory away from Woolwich to a safer site and if it is not so removed he expresses the view that the Admiralty would feel obliged to consider the necessity for insuring themselves by developing trade capacity for these guns elsewhere or by other means. The Woolwich Gun Factory could, if necessary, be separated from the Carriage and Ammunition factories. To do so, however, would involve the loss of the advantages, which result from its present linkage with the Carriage Department where Gun carriages are made, and of its proximity to the Design and Research establishments. The metallurgical sections of the Gun, Carriage and Ammunition factories work in close touch with the Research Department and it is of great advantage for these depart-ments to be located near one another. We refer later to the more general aspect of this linkage. It is sufficient now to say that if the Gun Factory alone were moved there would be a loss of flexibility in handling labour which Woolwich enjoys in being able to transfer men to different shops as work fluctuates. There would also be an addi-tional cost of administration due to isolation. If the Gun Factory were removed from Woolwich it would be necessary to erect proof butts in
the new locality but it would not be necessary to move the Experi-mental Establishment at Shoeburyness. The engineering district of GLASGOW lies within the reasonably safe area and is we think indicated as a suitable locality for the Gun Factory if it is moved.It is estimated that the cost of removal of the Gun Factory would be about  2,600,000. This sum includes the cost of the removal of the existing factory, shops, &amp;c. (with the necessary ancillary services and accommodation for inspection services) and of the Proof and Experimental section of the Research Department, the butts of which it would be necessary to separate from the factory by a distance of at least two miles and to connect by railway. The area required including the railway connections would be about 140 acres. The cost of the site is not included in the estimate. Without expensive re-arrangement within the Arsenal the removal of the Gun Factory would not free any site for sale.21. Manufacture of cartridge cases for the Navy.The output of large cartridge cases from the Ammunition Factory is vital to the Navy for anti-aircraft ammunition, as there is hardly any other source of supply. The reserve factory at Birtley is not adapted for large cases, but it could be so adapted so that these cases could be made both there and at Woolwich and thus disperse to some extent the factory capacity for these stores. Birtley, however, is situated 5 miles south of Newcastle-on-Tyne, and the Admiralty repre-sentative cannot agree that this locality would provide much additional certainty of supply, nor does he consider that, if expenditure is necessary to provide additional plant, it should be incurred in a factory which lies in an unsafe area. We make no recommendation in respect of the future of Birtley, as it is not regarded as falling within our terms of reference.22. Interlocking of Arsenal activities.We wish to record the importance of the interlocking of the Engineering factories with the other activities of the Arsenal. The Design Department, the Research Department, the Inspection Department, the Ordnance Committee, the linked Experimental Establishment at Shoeburyness, the Factory shops, which form a backing on a manufacturing scale, have all grown up in the course of many years into an organic whole which forms the Government^ main school or centre for the development of the art of munition manufacture. This aspect was stressed by the McKinnon Wood Committee when, in 1918, they recommended the retention of Woolwich Arsenal, and also by the Stevenson Committee in 1922. The manufacturing experience contained in an Arsenal enables process specifications and other means of rapidly mobilizing industry to be prepared in advance. If the manufacturing activities of the Arsenal are dispersed to other localities there will be a certain increase in the cost of design and research, and delays will occur in achieving results. There would also be some imponderable loss due to the absence of the very close touch which exists to-day.
The Royal Gunpowder Factory, Waltham Abbey23. The Royal Gunpowder Factory, originally a gunpowder factory in the time of Queen Elizabeth, is now a cordite factory making the two ingredients nitroglycerine and guncotton necessary for the production of cordite. It is designed to produce a maximum output of 240 tons of cordite a week needing 4,000 operatives. It now employs about 450 operatives. The site which lies along the western edge of Epping Forest consist of a strip of land about 3 miles long, through which runs the River Lea. The factory consists of about 600 buildings in 500 acres of land well concealed by trees. Its southern end is a, little over 13 miles north of the Thames. The cordite made is carried by barge down the Lea to the Thames and then to the magazines in Woolwich Arsenal. The great advantage which this safe water transport to Woolwich affords appears from history to have been an accidental advantage and not one deliberately sought; a similar remark applies to the advantage of the proximity of the Shoeburyness sands to Woolwich. Waltham lies within the London Air Defence Area. The risk from air attack there is much smaller than at Woolwich on account of the factory being more difficult to locate and to hit from the aii&apos;, but being within the London area it would be subject to frequent warnings which would lead to interruptions in work. In the last war, when the factory was fully active, there was in process at any one time 3 tons of nitroglycerine and over 50 tons of guncotton being dried. If these products had been hit, one end of the factory would have been wrecked and the whole factory would have been out of operation for many months. Certain new methods are under consideration which will greatly reduce the amount of risk at any one time, but the risk of serious damage in the case of a hit will remain. The effect on output of- interruption of work due to warnings is likely to be serious. Certain operations (e.g., nitrating a charge of glycerine) once begun cannot be stopped without risk of an explosion, and it was the practice in the last war not to begin such operations in periods in which raids were probable.24. Reliance on the Waltham Factory in war.Apart from the Admiralty cordite factory at Holton Heath near Poole there are only two factories in the country the Gunpowder Factory at Waltham and a trade factory at Ardeer (near Glasgow), which latter would have a rather greater maximum capacity than the Waltham factory if certain acid plant were added to it. Much reliance is therefore placed on the Waltham Gunpowder Factory in war. In the last war the additional cordite required was found partly from the trade, partly from imports, and at a later stage by the construction of a National Factory at Gretna, planned to produce 800 tons per week and employing at a maximum nearly 20,000 operatives.25. Cost of removal and suggested localities.It is estimated that the cost of the removal of the Royal -Gunpowder Factory which, in view of the nature of its plant, would
require almost complete reprovision, would be about  2,200,000, excluding any cost of site or housing which might be necessary for operatives. It is further estimated that the total area required would be 700 acres which permits proper observance of safety distances and of danger building conditions. In view of the emergency requirements no question of reducing the capacity of this factory arises. It would be necessary to transfer about 50 per cent, of the peace staff. We consider that the locality of QUEEN SFERRY, 8 miles from Chester, where there was a large explosive factory in the last war, would afford a suitable site for the Gunpowder factory if removed from Waltham. It would be within the reasonably safe area and in a district with good transport facilities and moreover close to Oswestry the proposed locality for the Filling Factory. Failing that, we would suggest a site in the locality of GRETNA, also within the reasonably safe area, where the former war time cordite factory was situated. Both war factory sites have been sold. The main considerations which determined the selection of Gretna during the war were, a level tract of land, a good water supply, an outlet for effluents into tidal waters, good railway facilities, reasonable access to coal fields, and sufficient population within reasonable distance by train as a supple-ment to local housing accommodation. These considerations also apply generally to the Queensferry district. We have been unable in the time available to obtain a valuation for the land at Waltham which would be released.Royal Small Arms Factory26. The Royal Small Arms Factory at Enfield Lock is situated immediately south of the Gunpowder Factory at Waltham Abbey and has an area of 99 acres. It is designed at present for the manufacture of rifles with certain accessories such as bayonets, &amp;c, and for the manufacture of pistols and machine guns. The risk from attack from the air is similar to that at the Royal Gunpowder Factory, that is to say the risk is much smaller than at Woolwich. The absence of explosives removes the danger of internal explosion that exists at Waltham. During the last war no structural damage was done by raids and the History of the Ministry of Munitions records that &quot; the effect of raids on output was, in comparison with the number of attacks,, small. For instance, of eleven raids in the latter part of 1917 involving a loss of about 18 hours, nine had no effect on output, but as a result of the remaining two a total of 2,600 rifles and a corresponding number of components were lost.&quot; (Vol. VIII, Part II, page 36.) Here, however, as we have remarked in the case of the Woolwich factories, we can only leave this fact on record for what it is worth and without expressing any opinion as to what might happen in any future war as to loss of output due to air raids and warnings of raids.27. In view of the large reserves of rifles held by the Army, and the existence in peace of trade sources of supply, there is not the great dependence on this factory for output in the first 12 months of war that exists in the case of filling and cordite.
28. The factory is a self-contained one with its own local design-and inspection department and though linked for metallurgical purposes with Woolwich it is not closely associated in day by day work with the Research and Design departments there. In view of the fore-going we have not thought it necessary to estimate the cost of removal of this factory or to suggest any new site.Summary and Recommendations29. While the London area is peculiarly liable to attack from the air there are on the other hand no industrially suitable areas in Great Britain that are immune from attack by a determined enemy. The degree of safety of an area is relative and may vary as the years go-by. Apart from the difficulty of determining the relative safety, there is also the difficulty of assigning relative importance to the other factors which must be taken into account, such as the higher degree of certainty of output, the disadvantages of dispersal and the cost of removal.If certainty of supply in war time were the only factor of importance we should, without hesitation, recommend that no manufac-turing activities should remain at Woolwich, Enfield or Waltham, but as we are unable to assess with accuracy the relative importance of the other factors we cannot do more than set out in the following table the order in which we would recommend removal of the factories : Paragraphs of report.

(a) As we have been pressed for time and as these factories come low down in the table we have not considered the question of a new locality for them nor have we asked for an estimate of the cost of their removal.We feel compelled, however, to stress the definite desirability of removal, as early as possible, to safer districts of the FILLING FACTORY at WOOLWICH and of the GUNPOWDER FACTORY at WALTHAM. Under normal conditions in times of peace it would probably take up to three years to complete the removal of each of these factories after the decision to remove had been taken.(8601)C

APPENDIXHEPORTS OF THE GENERAL, STAFF AND OF THE AIR MINISTRY1P.U.S.The Committee on the Removal of the Ordnance Factories at Woolwich, Enfield and Walfcham under the chairmanship of the F.M. have had before them the reports of the General Staff and of the Air Staff on the subject of the Air menace in relation to Woolwich Arsenal which were prepared for the Stevenson Committee in 1922, and the extract from the minutes of the C.I.D. dated 6th December, 1922, on those reports.The Committee would be glad to be given some indication as to the areas of Great Britain that could be regarded as comparatively safe, and whether within these areas the several departments now within the Arsenal could continue with safety to remain in close association as now and if not to what degree they should be dispersed.(Sgd.) G. F. S. Hills.Secretary of the Committee.3rd August, 1934.2PALS.1. Any line which might now be given as defining the &quot; safe &quot; zones in Great Britain would depend upon (a) The position of enemy air bases e.g., whether the Low Countries were in enemy hands.(6) The radius of action of bombing aircraft. As design is continually progressing, any data which we accept now may be quite misleading in a few years&apos; time.(c) The relative importance of the enomy&apos;s objective. It is probable that, in order to bomb an exceptionally attractive target, an enemy would make special efforts, if necessary taking a certain amount of extra risk in order to reach the objective.2. I consider it preferable therefore to regard the whole of Great Britain, with the possible exception of the remoter portions of Scotland, as vulnerable to air attack in a European War. A large arsenal in any part of the country would then be liable to bombing and, possibly, forego the advantage of inclusion in a large defensive area. If you cannot avoid the danger of being bombed, the only course is to diminish its effects by dispersion. On this basis instructions are being issued to Commands regarding the accommodation of troops in time of War. (See 79/Mob./1062.)3. There are two types of dispersion into widely separated groups, which might be called strategical dispersion, and the groups again being dispersed into individual packets, or tactical dispersion. For example, there are presumably some manu-facturing processes or stores which are more vulnerable than others and they should I am, of course, considering the problem only from the point of view of protection be situated in the remoter parts of the country where the risk of continuous raids would at all events be less. At the same time, within the area now occupied by the Arsenal, where there is, I believe, a considerable extent of unoccupied land, some degree of protection could be obtained by thinning out the workshops, &amp;c.   Similarly in any new factory, buildings should be dispersed.
4. It is difficult to give any definite opinion as to the degree of dispersion into-groups. The criterion of the size of group must rest on its importance as a target to bombers. Naturally, from this point of view, the smaller the target is, the better. Local geographical considerations, such as the existence of easily identifiable landmarks, or the proximity of other important industrial centres, may also affect the grouping.   Bach locality will have to be considered on its own merits.R. H.

Copy No.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the Minutes of the 269ifA Meeting, held on April 16, 1935.TV* W TV&quot; &quot;7t&quot;(4)-REMOVAL OF ROYAL ORDNANCE FACTORIES (WOOLWICH,ENFIELD, WALTHAM, &amp;c.) (C.I.D. Paper No. 208-A.)(Previous reference :   C.I.D. Minutes of the 264th meeting, Minute 6,Conclusion 2 (b).)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a memorandum by the-Secretary of State for War covering the Report of an Inter-Services Committee on the removal of the Royal Ordnance Factories at Woolwich, Enfield and. Waltham to other localities^ owing to their vulnerability to air attack (C.I.D.. Paper No. 208-A).LORD HAILSHAM said that this was an important matter, on which it was necessary to ask for the direction of the Committee of Imperial Defence, who had requested the War Office, about a year ago, to consider the problem. The War Office Committee, under Mr. Hacking, had recommended the removal to safer districts of the Royal Filling Factory (Woolwich), the Royal Gunpowder Factory (Waltham) and the Royal Gun Factory (Woolwich), the estimated cost of which was approximately  7 million. With the assistance of the Air Ministry, the Committee had considered the most suitable localities in which to re-erect these-factories, and had recommended the following areas :  Oswestry district.Queens Ferry or Gretna district.Glasgow district.It was necessary for the Committee of Imperial Defence to decide whether the conditions regarding security, as assumed by the Interdepartmental Committee, were correct. The latter had worked on the basis that the Woolwich area was vulnerable and that the presence of large quantities of high explosives was a grave danger. They had accordingly advised the removal of these factories to safer localities. The financial implications were very important, as a sum of  7 million was involved.  This could not possibly come out of the Army Estimates..Two minor matters also arose out of the Report. In the first place, the plant of Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., at Billingham, which produced high explosives, was located in an area vulnerable to air attack. Secondly, the War-Office were considering the reconditioning of the reserve factory at Birtley, five miles south of Newcastle-on-Tyne. As no explosives would be held at this factory, the Army Council were prepared to accept the risk of the locality rather than incur the expense of building a new factory, and they would like the concurrence of the Committee of Imperial Defence in this view.THE PRIME MINISTER observed that from the purely military point of&quot; view the case for the removal of the factories appeared to have been proved. There were, however, many other big problems involved, which it would be-necessary to solve at the same time.[11491-4]
oIn reply to the Prime Minister, SIR PHILIP CUNLIFFE-LISTER agreed that from the military point of view the War Office Committee had an unanswerable case. In spite of the air defence measures which were being under-taken, it would be impossible to prevent the bombing of the Woolwich area.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said we could not ignore the fact that the location of these factories and the storage of highly explosive material in an area vulnerable to air attack created a source of real danger. The psychological effect of large explosions would be very great. He must confess, however, that he was disappointed at the locations recommended for the new factories. He referred to the assumptions regarding security, on which the Committee had based their recommendations (given in paragraph 6 of the Report), and said he could not understand why South Wales had been excluded.SIR ARCHIBALD MONTGOMERY-MASSINGBERD explained that in considering these localities the Committee had taken a long view and had recommended areas which would still be suitable in, say, from fifty to 100 years&apos; time, when the international situation might have changed considerably.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said it was impossible to look so far ahead. Certain very pressing considerations now existed. The labour situation in South Wales was very serious. This area could be considered reasonably safe from attack by Germany. Thus the location of some factories in this area would go a long way to solving the social, political and financial problems at present existing there.THE PRIME MINISTER drew attention to a map attached to C.I.D. Paper No. 205-A, which showed that South Wales was within an arc of 350 miles drawn from the Low Countries. He referred to the rapid development -of aircraft within the last few years, and pointed out that within the next ten years it was quite possible that more distant areas in the United Kingdom might become liable to air attack owing to the increasing range of aircraft.Mr. THOMAS said he would like to see greater consideration given to the needs of the distressed areas when the new location of the factories was decided, always assuming, however, that the areas selected were reasonably safe.Mr. BALDWIN agreed with this view and suggested that, owing to the configuration of the country, South Wales provided many areas offering good security against air attack.   Good transport facilities also existed.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN suggested that it might be possible to induce Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., to erect an explosives factory in the South Wales area at the same time as the Government factory was erected there.Mr. THOMAS thought that the Committee of Imperial Defence could agree in principle to the removal of the Royal Ordnance Factories, but that the other implications of the problem could only be settled by the Cabinet.SIR WARREN FISHER informed the Committee that he had been having a series of informal talks with the War Office on this subject, and he would like these to reach a further stage before the Report was considered by the Cabinet. He would get in touch with the Departments concerned and would arrange for the Report to go before the Cabinet when these investigations had been completed. He did not think it necessary to refer the Report to the Committee of Imperial Defence again.Conclusions. The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed &apos;(a) To approve in principle the recommendations of the Report of the Committee on the removal of the Royal Ordnance Factories forwarded with the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War (C.I.D. Paper No. 208-A).(b) To take note of the remarks in paragraph 17 of the Report concerning the vulnerability to air attack of the plant of Imperial Chemical Industries, Limited, at Billingham.
-(c) To concur in the view expressed by the Army Council (referred to in paragraph 9 of the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War) that in considering the reconditioning of the reserve factory they are prepared to accept the risk of the locality rather than incur the expense of erection of a building elsewhere.(d) That the question should be referred to the Cabinet, who should receivethe paper that had been before the Committee of Imperial Defence, these conclusions, and a report based on the consultations between the Treasury, the War Office and the other Departments concerned.(e) To draw the attention of the Cabinet to Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s suggestionthat it might be possible to induce Imperial Chemical Industries, Limited, to erect an explosives factory in South Wales at the same time as the Government factory was erected there.$fc ^fe ^fc rjfc $fc 4f*2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, April 16, 1935.
MOST SECEET.REMOVAL OF EOYAL ORDNANCE FACTORIES.Joint Note by the Treasury and the War Office..ON the 16th April the Committee of Imperial Defence approved in principle recommendations for the removal of three of the Royal Ordnance Factories from Woolwich and Waltham, but asked for further consideration of the&apos; question whether a site for the Royal Filling Factory, the first.to be dealt with, which it had been suggested should be removed to Oswestry, could not be found in a depressed area. The Treasury and the War Office have accordingly considered the possibility of finding a site in one of the depressed areas. As the North-Eastern area is too vulnerable, the choice lies between Scotland, South Wales and the North-West.The conditions to be fulfilled are : (1) A level site of not less than 500 acres; (2) Low vulnerability to air attack;(3) Accessibility by rail for supplies of components and for distribution ofthe finished product; (4) Labour supply.   (The factory employs about 700 hands in peace and upto 19,000 in war, principally women.)The first condition rules out the Welsh Valleys themselves. The War Office got into touch &quot;with the Great Western Railway, and four sites in South Wales were put forward for consideration by the General Manager. Two of these were definitely rejected for very obvious tactical reasons, and one site proved quite unsuitable owing to the incidence of winter flooding. There remained a fourth site-near Bridgend which was possible. This site, however, has two grave disadvantages. It is a very long way from the sources of shell supply in the Midlands and the North, and further it is open to objection from, a tactical point of view. The Tuskar Rocks, at the mouth of the River Ogwr, give a very definite land-mark for aircraft, following the course of the River Severn, to pick up.Owing to the undoubted objections to the Bridgend site, the War Office explored a number of sites in Lancashire, and they found one which appears, prima facie, to be extremely suitable. It lies between Chorley and Ley land. The advantages of this site from other points of view are very great. It is quite close to an important industrial supply of extremely suitable labour, and from the strategical point of view it is about as safe as any that could be discovered. The Pennine Range creates meteorological difficulties for aircraft, which are of considerable value to any defence, and the site itself is not easily distinguished. A detailed comparison of the labour conditions in the two areas is given in the appendix.It will be seen that the Chorley site has every advantage over the Bridgend site, except that it is not situated in an area which is at present labelled as &quot; depressed.&quot; But, on the other hand, the &quot; depressed&quot; population within easy reach of Chorley is very much larger than that at Bridgend, arid the need of new industries in this part of Lancashire is becoming daily more acute.The result of the further examination by the Treasury and the War Office points to the provisional approval of the removal of the Filling Factory from Woolwich to the Chorley site and the War Office would like to have authority to proceed with a detailed examination of the site, and if it proves suitable, with its acquisition. It is important that pending these enquiries the location should be kept secret.July 26, 1935.
APPENDIX.THE two sites have been examined from the point of view of (a) accessibility to a supply of suitable labour; (b) the claims of the local population in respect of &quot; depression.&quot; The following figures, which relate to May 1935, indicate the position : -I. (a) Bridgend has a total population of 10,000 and an insured population of 3,800.  Percentage of unemployed, 32-1.(6) Within 12 miles by rail are Maesteg, Ogmore and Port Talbot, with a population of 94,000 (insured, 22,100) and unemployment percentages of 43-8, 29-8 and 31-8.(c) Within 15 miles, at Pontypridd and Porth, is a further insured population of 22,000, with unemployment percentages of 54-7 and 43-1.All these places are scheduled by the Ministry of Labour as &quot; depressed,&quot; and are also in the &quot; special area &quot; of South Wales.II. (a) Chorley has a total population of 31,000 and an insured population of 19,500. Percentage of unemployment, 24-1. It is a scheduled &quot; depressed &quot; area.(b) Within 12 miles by rail areWigan Hindley Horwich Bolton Blackburn Leyland PrestonPopulation.		UnemploymentTotal.	Insured.	Percentage.85,000	45,000	27-522,000	7,000	43-716,000	8,000	15-5177,000	67,000	22-0123,000	54,000	32-330,000	11,000	4-4119,000	54,000	18-2583,000	246,000	(c) Within 15 miles there are also Ashton-in-Makerfield (14-6), Atherton and Tyldesley (9-2), Farnworth (20-9), Radcliffe (19-7) and Darwen (26-7) with an insured population of 84,000 (unemployment percentages in brackets).Besides Chorley, Wigan, Hindley and Farnworth are scheduled &apos;&apos; depressed &apos;&apos; areas, and Bolton, Blackburn, Preston and Darwen are scheduled as special &quot;cotton&quot; areas, i.e., places mainly dependent on the cotton trade, where unemployment has been so severe and prolonged as to call for special treatment, e.g., by &quot; transference.&quot;III. It will be seen that the Chorley site has access to a much larger supply of labour, a point of particular importance for war-time expansion. A large proportion of the labour required is female, and in this respect Lancashire has a great advantage over South Wales. Further, in so far as additional skilled mechanics may be needed in war-time, the potential supply within reach of Chorley is very much greater than at Bridgend.Local road and rail communications are very definitely better at Chorley.As regards &quot; depression,&quot; though the area round Bridgend may probably be regarded as being now, and having.for longer been, more severely depressed &amp;s a whole than that round Chorley, the number of individuals suffering from protracted unemployment and without prospects of re-employment in ordinary, industry is much larger in the Chorley area. The Special Commissioner (Mr. P. M. Stewart) would no doubt put in a strong plea for Bridgend. The desirability of establishing Government factories in South Wales was mentioned in Lord Portal&apos;s report.
