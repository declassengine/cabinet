It will be observed that the Committee was not appointed to consider the wider issues involved nor to assess the imperial or international interests at stake. The Committee restricted itself to a study &quot; from the narrow standpoint of the British material interests in and near Ethiopia &quot; of the effect of an absorption of that country by Italy. It should also be noted that the earlier meetings of the Committee took place at a time when an Italian aggression did not yet appear imminent or so certain as it later came to appear.S.

295SECRET.REPORT OF INTER-DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON BRITISHINTERESTS IN ETHIOPIA.[With Map.][J 2381/97/1]Sir John Maffey to Foreign Office.(Secret.)Sir, Downing Street, June 18, 1935.I HAVE the honour to refer to your letter No. J 874/97/1 of the 6th March last, in which it was suggested that an Inter-Departmental Committee should be set up in order to consider and report on British interests in Ethiopia, in the light of the present Italian-Ethiopian tension, and of the expressed desire of the Italian Government to discuss with His Majesty&apos;s Government the possibility of the development of British and Italian interests in Ethiopia in a mutually harmonious manner. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was good enough to suggest that I should act as chairman to such a committee.2. The Departments consulted concurred in the suggestion that such a committee should be set up, and representatives of the Foreign Office, the Colonial Office, the War Office, the Admiralty, the Air Ministry and the Dominions Office were nominated to serve on it. The committee has had a number of meetings, and I now have the honour, as chairman, to submit herewith its report.3. I desire to take this opportunity to express my appreciation of, and to bring to your notice, the services rendered by my colleagues on this committee. Their task has been greatly facilitated by the efficiency of their secretary, Mr. F. G. Lee, of the Colonial Office, and by their desire I call special attention to the admirable manner in which he discharged his duties.I have, &amp;c.J. L. MAFFEY.Report of Inter-Departmental Committee on British Interests in Ethiopia.Introduction.WE were appointed in pursuance of a suggestion put forward in a letter from the Foreign Office of the 6th March, 1935, a copy of which is annexed to this report. That letter referred to an important demarche made by the Italian Government in January last, when the counsellor to the Italian Embassy in London (M. Vitetti) stated at an interview (in the course of which he had given an account of the secret Franco-Italian understanding concerning Ethiopia which was reached at Rome earlier in the month) that he was under instructions to intimate that the Italian Government &quot; would like to exchange views with His Majesty&apos;s Government on the respective interests of - both Governments in Ethiopia and to explore the possibility of the development of such interests in a mutually harmonious manner.&quot;It was pointed out in the Foreign Office letter that this demarche could hardly be dissociated from the Italian-Ethiopian dispute : and that it was necessary that consideration of the reply to be made to the Italian Government should take into account the probable ultimate aim of the Italian Government in Ethiopia -which was defined as being &quot;not a mere economic predominance only, but the virtual absorption of as much Ethiopian territory as can be achieved without jeopardy to their interests and influence in other parts of the world.&quot; It was accordingly thought desirable that the question of how far British interests in 7990   [12021] B
Ethiopia and in the countries bordering on Ethiopia would be affected by the absorption of the whole or part of Ethiopia by Italy should, with certain related questions, be examined in the first instance by an Inter-Departmental Committee.2. We have had seven meetings, and have taken the opportunity to consult a number of persons who have first-hand knowledge of Ethiopia or who are serving in British territories contiguous to that country. We have also consulted representatives from Government Departments in this country.3. It is necessary to explain that we have felt it desirable to limit the scope of our report. It was suggested in the Foreign Office letter in which the formation of the committee was proposed that we should examine, inter alia, how the absorption of the whole or part of Ethiopia by Italy would &apos;&apos; react upon the existing treaty rights and obligations of this country with respect to Ethiopia and the two foreign limitrophe Powers &quot; (i.e. Italy and France), and that we should endeavour to calculate what the effect of such an action by the Italian Govern-ment would be on the general political relations between that Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom. We have felt, however, that we are not qualified to advise His Majesty&apos;s Government on the fundamental question of what British policy should be in regard to Italian aims in Ethiopia; since this policy must clearly depend on factors intrinsically more important than any British interest in Ethiopia -the general situation in Europe and the role which it is desired that Italy should play on the European stage, the question of how far His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to support the League of Nations at the risk of losing Italian friendship, and the like factors which involve considerations of high policy beyond the purview of the committee and some of which, indeed, vary in relative importance from time to time. We therefore came to the conclusion that it would be preferable if we confined ourselves to setting out what, in our view, are the basic facts, in so far as they relate to Ethiopia and the neighbouring territories, which should be taken into account in framing British policy vis-a-vis Italian aims in Ethiopia: that is to say, we have attempted to determine and to set out what are the main British interests, both those existing now and those which may assume importance in the future, in and around Ethiopia, and to say how those interests would be likely to be affected if Ethiopia passed under Italian control. We have indicated briefly what action by His Majesty&apos;s Government would, in our view, be necessary in regard to those interests in the event of the absorption of the whole or part of Ethiopia by Italy : the question of how far such action would be practicable, and of the exact manner in which it should be taken, if practicable, must naturally depend, however, on the general international situation prevailing at the time, and on the general policy which His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to pursue in regard to Italian aims in Ethiopia : and we have therefore refrained from comment on this aspect of the matter. It follows from this that we have equally refrained from attempting to advise on the exact form of the answer to the recent demarche from the Italian Government. We have aimed merely at providing a basis on which a reply could be framed.4. Similarly, we have felt that the most useful course would be if, in considering how British interests in and near Ethiopia would be affected in the event of the absorption of that country by Italy, we took no account of the wider moral issues involved by any such action on the part of Italy. In other words, we have examined the question from the narrow standpoint of the British material interests in and near Ethiopia, and, while we have included a summary of the main international agreements affecting Ethiopia, we have not tried to pronounce an opinion on the fundamental question whether, from a wider standpoint, His Majesty&apos;s Government should acquiesce in an action by Italy which would involve a clear breach of obligations undertaken in at least three international agree-ments, of which both His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Italian Government are signatories the Tripartite Agreement of 1906, the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Kellogg Pact. Thus it must not be assumed that because we refer in the report to possible future arrangements with Italy in regard, say, to a territorial division of Ethiopia, we are suggesting that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should condone, or should connive at, an Italian absorption of Ethiopia, the integrity of which His Majesty&apos;s Government has undertaken to maintain. We have set aside the moral aspect and the question of how far the wider interests of Great Britain or its relations to other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations will be served by opposing designs contrary to international obliga-
tions; we have regarded an Italian conquest of Ethiopia as a given fact, and have then indicated what action should be taken so far as the narrow aspect of British interests, in and near Ethiopia is concerned. In like manner we have not taken into account what may be called the moral effects on Ethiopia itself likely to follow an Italian conquest e.g. the suppression of slavery even though the suppression of slavery can be regarded as a general and world-wide British interest.5. The report is in three parts Part I is intended to give the general background to the problem. Part II is an endeavour to analyse Italian aims, immediate and ultimate, in Ethiopia, and Part III sets out what are British interests in and near Ethiopia, how they would be affected by Italian absorption of the country (or of part of it), and what action would appear to be necessary in that event in order to safeguard those interests.PART I.(a) Situation, Boundaries, and Physical Features.6. Ethiopia, which has no outlet to the sea, is a country of approximately 350,000 square miles in extent, lying between 3D and 150 north latitude and 33Q and 470 east longitude.It is bounded by territories under the control of Great Britain, France and Italy and by the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan : on the north and north-east by the Italian protectorate of Eritrea : on the west by the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan : on the south and south-east by Kenya and Italian Somaliland and on the east by French and British Somaliland. Nearly 2,000 miles of its boundaries are contiguous to territory under British control. The frontier between Ethiopia and Italian Somaliland remains undemarcated, as does that with Kenya and a considerable part of that with the Sudan : this fact, coupled with the vague-descriptions of the frontiers in the relevant treaties, has been partly the cause of the numerous frontier incidents and disputes which during recent years have been a feature of Ethiopians relations with her neighbours.7. The country can be divided into four main areas : (a) The Danakil lowlands in the north-east, an area of sandy and rocky desert sparsely inhabited by the fierce Danakil tribes over whom Ethiopian control is very shadowy. (&amp;) The Somali plateau, beginning in the hills of Harar and gradually declining into a half-desert country towards the Indian Ocean. This again can be regarded as an appendage to Ethiopia proper: much of it is occupied by tribes, e.g., the Ogaden, over whom control by the Ethiopian authorities is intermittent and uncertain, (c) In the south-west there is the Eastern Rift valley, and the high-lands of the Galla country, sinking towards the Sobat plain. This is for the most part difficult and mountainous country rising to over 13,000 feet at one point (Mount Guze) but with much cultivated land and large tracts of forest. (d) Finally in the centre and north of the country, there is Ethiopia proper a high plateau from the eastern scarp to the Sudan plain and from Addis Ababa in the south to the Eritrean frontier. &quot; This section is wholly mountainous except on its western border (where the plateau descends in a series of terraces) its average height being 5,000-6,000 feet. Addis Ababa itself lies at 8,000 feet. The deep and jungle-choked river valleys in this area constitute a formidable obstacle to travel; the difficulty of communications and of contact between the centre and outlying areas is a fundamental feature of Ethiopia which has hampered, and continues to hamper, orderly and civilised government. .8. Most of the rivers flow to the west. The most important is the Blue Nile which drains nearly all the central part of the plateau. Its headwaters flow through Lake Tsana (1,350 square miles) and then, after a winding course, it enters the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. According to one calculation, as much as 80 per cent, of the Nile flow comes from the Blue Nile : hence the great importance of Lake Tsana and this river to the Sudan and Egypt. Although, in so far as the construction of a barrage is concerned, Lake Tsana only is of importance since it is understood that it would not be possible for works affecting the flow of the Nile to be constructed in the Blue Nile Valley itself. Other rivers of potential importance are the Webbe Shibeli and the Juba, both of , which run through Italian Somaliland to the Indian Ocean. The headwaters of both these rivers are in Ethiopia a factor of some importance in Italian-Ethiopian relations. [12021] B 2
(b) Population.9. The population is estimated to be about 7,500,000; but there are no precise statistics. It is 85-90 per cent. Hamitic. The dominant (or true Ethiopian) race is Cushite, occupying most of the country north of Addis Ababa and west of the DanaJkil country; it is thought that they number about one-third of the total population. They are monophysite Christians. The Gallas, the most intelligent of the non-Cushite races, are scattered over large areas of Ethiopia, especially in the south and south-west. They are either pagans or semi-Mahometans. The outlying parts of Ethiopia are occupied by non-Cushite tribes: Danakils in the north-east lowlands; nomadic Somalis in the country on the eastern and south-eastern frontier; negroid races (representing varying degrees of Hamitic and negro combinations) along the western frontier.There is thus a striking absence of homogeneity; and the discordant ambitions of the diverse races accentuated in some cases by harsh treatment on the part of the ascendant Cushites adds another factor to Ethiopian instability. It is, however, a factor which it is possible to over-estimate: while Somalis, Danakils or the negro tribes would probably repudiate without hesitation, and especially for cash, the authority of Addis Ababa (which they often flout at present), it is thought that if the independence of Ethiopia were threatened by another power, the Gallas (by far the most important non-Cushite race) would remain loyal especially if that power were Italy.10. Ethiopia is to a large degree self-supporting, and the actual or potential richness of the country is not, therefore, reflected in the trade figures. The volcanic soil and the excellent climate are said to make it a country (in the plateau areas) of extraordinary fertility, capable of yielding a wide diversity of products, ranging from wheat and barley to purely tropical products, such as rubber bananas or cotton. , Only three products are sold abroad in any quantity : Coffee, hides and skins and beeswax. The value of coffee exports in a normal year is about  400,000- 500,000 (as compared with an average of over  1,000,000 from Kenya); that of hides and skins exported about  200,000- 300,000. Undoubtedly, it is a country susceptible of great agricultural development; at present agricul-ture and stock-raising are still primitive, and, under existing conditions, little progress is discernible. The increase in Ethiopia&apos;s foreign trade over the last twenty-five years has been negligible when compared with the increase in that of the Sudan or Kenya. (Thus, although the standardisation and improvement of Kenya coffee has severely affected Ethiopian coffee sales, there has been little or no attempt to improve the quality of the local product.) Apart from some struggling Belgian coffee-growing concessions, there are no European agricultural enterprises of any importance. In the absence of detailed surveys, it is impossible to speak with any degree of certainty about the country&apos;s potential mineral wealth, though it is probable that this has been exaggerated. The volcanic nature of the country favours the occurrence of minerals, and rumours of extensive reefs have been current for many years. There is reliable evidence of the presence of low-grade gold and platinum deposits some of which are worked more or less spas-modically. Exports of platinum during recent years have averaged about 190,000 grains a year, or roughly 3 per cent, of the world production. The present production of gold (from alluvial deposits) does not exceed 8,000 oz. a year. The known deposits are, however, very difficult of access, and it is doubtful whether they could be worked profitably on a large scale, even if reasonable terms of concession under an efficient administration could be obtained. His Majesty&apos;s consul at Addis Ababa summed the matter up in 1931 as follows : &quot; All that can be said with certainty is that no sign appears to indicate that the deposits of gold or platinum provide opportunity for anything but &apos;small man&apos; workings.&quot; There is little or no evidence of the presence of copper, tin or oil, though it is, of course, impossible to be precise as to this.11. It is impossible to obtain any recent trade statistics, and such figures as exist are usually incomplete and unreliable. And, owing to the fact that the bulk of the exports and imports pass through entrepot centres at Aden, Jibuti or Berbera, it is difficult to obtain any reliable information as to countries of origin or destination.   The following table, however, which shows import and export(c) Natural Resources and Trade.
figures for three typical years 1912 (pre-war), 1928-29 (a year of prosperity), and 1929-30 (the first year of the slump)-via the three main trade routes (Jibuti, the Sudan and British Somaliland) may be of interest as giving a general picture of Ethiopian trade : (a) Imports.Route.	1912.	1928-29.	1929-30.

Estimated.(Note. Comparative figures of exports and imports via Eritrea are not available. Trade by this route would appear to average about 10 per cent, of the trade by all other routes.)Since 1930 there has been a further deterioration in the trade position. Imports have declined, and there are now said to be large stocks of coffee and hides and skins in the country which can find no market. No full statistics later than 1929-30 can, however, be obtained.Cotton goods and cotton yarn represent the bulk of the import trade, and this is almost entirely in Japanese hands, though India has retained some of the trade in cotton yarn. Trade with the United Kingdom is negligible, as is shown by the following figures : 1930 1931 1932 1933 1934Ethiopia-United Kingdom Trade. Years 1930-34.Imports into United Kingdom - from Ethiopia.(2)  229,032 216,517 138,651 191,624 165,123(s) Chiefly dried hides.Exports, including re-exports, from United Kingdom to Ethiopia.  34,296 23,298 19,533 39,503 49,664It is impossible to get any reliable figures concerning Indian trade with Ethiopia, as the great bulk of this passes through Aden and Jibuti, and the returns make it very difficult to trace trade with any certainty. Generally speaking, however, while Ethiopian exports to India are negligible, Indian exports to Ethiopia appear to be somewhat more valuable than those from the United Kingdom, though they have declined in recent years in the face of Japanese competition. They probably, however, amount to less than  70,000 a year in value.
12. Apart from the Jibuti Railway, there are no large-scale European, enterprises operating in Ethiopia. (There is no British capital invested in this railway, which, after a period of comparative prosperity, following heavy losses in the period 1916-21, is now in difficulties again.) The Bank of Ethiopia (turnover about  800,000- 1 million) is now a State bank, though its higher staff is English. There is one British company operating without any marked success a mineral concession (the Prasso Concession) in the west of Ethiopia: but otherwise British mercantile interests are represented by Indian and Somali traders. It is estimated that these handle about 36-40 per cent, of the import trade and a rather larger proportion of the exports.13. Existing British trade interests in Ethiopia may therefore be summarised as follows : (a) There are. no large vested British interests in the country. A compara-tively small number of British subjects (chiefly Indians and Somalis) are engaged in trade in the country, though the volume and value of that trade are relatively unimportant..(&amp;) Direct trade both with Great Britain and with India is negligible.(c) The direct and transit trade with British Somaliland and the Sudan is of some importance to those territories, especially in the case of the Sudan, where there has been a marked increase in recent years, especially via Gambeila. (The total value of the British Somaliland trade varies according to the rates on the Jibuti Railway : it may be taken as about  80,000 a year.) The following table shows the total Sudan trade in the years for which the latest returns are available :  Summary of Sudan Trade with Ethiopia, 1931, 1932 and 1933.	1931.	1932.	1933.Articles.	 E.

The history of Ethiopia prior to the reign of Theodore (born 1818, died 1868) is colourful and fascinating, but is not relevant to this report. The ascendancy of Theodore is significant for two reasons : Theodore began to assert the power of the Emperor and the Central Government against the great Rases, while the first important contact between Ethiopia and European Powers in modern times began in his reign. The first English consul to Ethiopia was appointed in 1847, and concluded a treaty of commerce (which remained a dead letter) with Ras Ali of Amhara in 1849 : a considerable impetus was given to missionary work. After 1862, however, Theodore (whose character had deteriorated and who was faced with serious internal revolts) grew increasingly hostile to European influences, an attitude of mind strengthened by unfortunate-English and French diplomatic blunders. In 1864 the English consul was arrested, and, finally, all the Europeans in the country were imprisoned in Magdala. All attempts to obtain the release of the prisoners by negotiation failed, and in January 1868 Sir Robert Napier landed with an expeditionary force of 16,000 men at Annesley Bay. Magdala was reached, attacked and stormed in April 1868; Theodore committed suicide within its gates. Later in 1868 the expedition left the country. It is important to recall (a) that the Magdala expedition was essentially a raid, with a limited objective, which was attained; there was no attempt at conquest or administration; (b) that the expedition received much assistance from Ethiopian chiefs in revolt against Theodore, especially Kassa of Tigre (John IV). The fact that no attempt was. made to retain a portion of Ethiopia as British territory after the Magdala expedition is said to have given the British a reputation for fair dealing in Ethiopia which they have never lost.
15. After four years of confusion Theodore was succeeded by John (Kassa of Tigre) (1872-89). The chief feature of John&apos;s reign was the frustrated attempt of Egypt, under Ismail, to conquer Ethiopia. In 1865-72 Egyptian power was pushed steadily down the western shores of the Red Sea; Berbera and Harrar were occupied in 1872, and in 1875 an Egyptian expedition set out from Massawa to conquer the whole country. This was, however, completely defeated, as was a second expedition in 1876. In 1884, after the conquest of the Sudan south of Khartum by the Dervishes, a treaty was signed between England, Egypt and Ethiopia, the prime object of which was to facilitate the withdrawal of the Egyptian garrisons in the Sudan through Ethiopia. But it marks the abandonment of the Egyptian attempt to gain ascendancy over Ethiopia (Harrar was evacuated in the same year) though the tendency in Egypt to regard Ethiopia as a country which should by right belong to Egypt has not wholly disappeared and has some political significance.16. John was killed in the moment of victory over the Dervishes in 1889. He was succeeded by the famous Menelik, King of Shoa, the greatest figure in modern Ethiopia. The two predominant features of Menelik&apos;s reign were (a) the striking degree of Imperial authority and consolidation which he achieved, and (b) his successful struggle with Italy. Menelik was the first Ethiopian Emperor of whom it might be said that he was facile princeps; not only did he extend Ethiopian territory considerably by the conquest of Galla and other territory, but in the latter years of his reign there was no serious threat to his authority from any quarter; and his commanding position was naturally strengthened by the prestige gained by his victory over Italy.17. Effective Italian occupation of Eritrea began in 1882; Massawa was occupied in 1885 and the Italians steadily pushed their forces inland, occupying the northern parts of Tigre. At first their relations with Menelik were friendly. Certain minor treaties, relating to the supply of arms and the opening of trade routes, were followed by the conclusion of the treaty of Uccialli (May 1889), which defined the limits of Ethiopian and Italian territory and contained in article 17 a provision which practically gave Italy a protectorate over Ethiopia, since it stated (at any rate in the Italian text) that Menelik &apos;&apos; consents to make use of the Government of His Majesty the King of Italy in treating of all matters that may arise with other Powers or Governments.&quot; Italian penetration of Tigre, however, continued. In 1891 they concluded an alliance with one of Menelik&apos;s rivals (Ras Mangasha) with the object of detaching Tigre from Ethiopia, and Menelik realised that Italian aims and Ethiopian independence were incompatible. Accordingly in 1893, having waited to make sure of receiving a present of 2 million cartridges sent to him to induce him to acquiesce in the Italian protectorate, Menelik formally denounced the Treaty of Uccialli to all the Powers. The Italian advance into Tigre was temporarily interrupted by operations against the Dervishes, but was resumed in the spring of 1895, when Adowa was occupied. Menelik, however, succeeded in arousing a wave of genuine enthusiasm against the invader; the great Rases supported him loyally despite Italian intrigues, and in March 1896 the Italians were completely defeated at Adowa. The memory of Adowa has overshadowed all subsequent Italian-Ethiopian relations; on the one hand the memory of humiliating defeat, on the other an inordinate sense of military superiority. By the treaty of peace signed at Addis Ababa in 1896 the Treaty of Uccialli was annulled, and Italy recognised the absolute independence of Ethiopia.18. During the twelve years between the battle of Adowa and Menelik&apos;s breakdown in health (1908) the main foundations of modern Ethiopia were established. Most European Powers sent permanent diplomatic representatives to Addis Ababa; the boundaries were defined, though often vaguely, in a series of treaties; the Jibuti Railway (built under a concession originally granted in 1894 was begun in 1907; the Bank of Ethiopia was established under a concession granted in 1905 to the National Bank of Egypt; the power of the central Govern-ment (that is, the Emperor) over the great Rases and the frontier districts was greatly increased; slavery was nominally abolished. Menelik died in 1913. Intrigues by the Empress Taitu to seize power for her family were thwarted, and Menelik was succeeded by his grandson Lij Yasu. His reign was a period of complete confusion, accentuated by unrest caused by the war and by Lij Yasu&apos;s support of Mahometanism. Finally, after much internal fighting, the Shoan chiefs deposed Lij Yasu in September 1916 and proclaimed as Empress Waizaro
Zauditu (a daughter of Menelik) with Dejazmach (afterwards Has) Taffari (the son of Ras Makonnen, Menelik&apos;s nephew) as Regent and heir to the throne. After some years of friction with the Empress, Ras Taffari succeeded in securing a position of complete dominance in 1928, when he assumed the title of Negus. The Empress died in 1929, and Ras Taffari became Emperor. Since the war the internal condition of Ethiopia has slowly improved. There has been, in recent years, no revolt serious enough to menace the stability of the regime. The Emperor has endeavoured to make his authority effective over the local chiefs and in the outlying districts, particularly by the provision of better communications; there has been a sincere, though unhappily only partially successful, attempt to improve frontier administration, to eradicate slavery, brigandage and other abuses. Cruelty, crudity and confusion can still be found in Ethiopia. Ethiopian pride, suspicion, intolerance, and indolence make reform slow and difficult; but it does not appear reasonable or just to write off the Ethiopian Empire as irremedially barbarous and uncivilised without any hope of eventual reform.19. Reference is made below to some of the post-war&apos; agreements affecting Ethiopia; the most significant event in its foreign relations of recent years was its admission to the League of Nations in September 1923, subject to certain conditions as to the control of slavery and of the arms traffic. It might be mentioned that the admission of Ethiopia to the League was supported by France and Italy, but opposed by Great Britain on the ground that Ethiopia had not reached a state of civilisation and internal security sufficient to warrant her admission.A Parliament, members of which are nominated, was inaugurated in November 1931 under the terms of a Constitution granted in the previous June. It has, however, little or no influence, nor has the Cabinet. The Emperor remains all-powerful: he is, in fact, his own Prime Minister.Diplomatic Background.20. A brief reference is desirable to the more important of the treaties or international agreements affecting Ethiopia. A study of these reflects the diverse interests of England, Italy and France so far as Ethiopia is concerned. The main and, indeed, almost the exclusive interest of the French has been the safe-guarding of their interests in the Jibuti Railway. The main preoccupations of the United Kingdom have been to regularise the position on the frontiers, to protect our interests in Lake Tsana, and to secure the abolition of slavery. The Italians have constantly thought in terms of spheres of influence and wide economic concessions.  The most important treaties are as follow :- (a) Anglo-Italian A agreements of March and April 1891 and of May 1894.These agreements (the first two of which were concluded at a time when the Treaty of Uccialli was regarded as giving Italy a protectorate over Ethiopia) defined the respective spheres of influence of the two Powers in East Africa. The net result was to place within the Italian sphere the whole of Ethiopia lying to the east of longitude 350 and to the north of latitude 6&quot; north as far east as its intersection with the main stream of the Juba, that is to say, the whole of Ethiopia, except two small segments to the west and south of the above lines, and a small portion in the east bordering on British Somaliland.These agreements were included among those mentioned in the Tripartite Agreement of 1906 (see below) as determining the political and territorial status quo of Ethiopia, which England, France and Italy undertook in that agreement to maintain. In so far, therefore, as no modification was made by the terms of the Tripartite Agreement itself, His Majesty&apos;s Government have recognised, by these protocols, almost the whole of Ethiopia as an Italian sphere of influence. Article. 4 (a) of the Tripartite Agreement, however, definitely safeguards &apos;&apos; the interests of Great Britain and Egypt in the Nile basin, more especially as regards the regulation of the waters of the river and its tributaries,&quot; without prejudice to the interests of Italy in Ethiopia, &quot;more especially with reference to the hinterland of her possessions and the territorial connexion between them to the west of Addis Ababa.&quot; The reconciliation of these special interests is a matter of great difficulty, concerning which there has from time to* time been considerable correspondence with the Italian Government.   Put briefly,.
His Majesty&apos;s Government have always maintained that the Italians could not claim that, if Ethiopia broke up, she was entitled under the 1891 and 1906 agreements to exercise territorial sovereignty over that portion of the Nile basin which is in Ethiopia. Sir E. Grey summed the matter up when he told the Italian Ambassador in November 1913 that, &quot; should Ethiopia break up, Italy must have a territorial connexion between Eritrea and Italian Somaliland to the west of Addis Ababa, but this connexion was to be secured in such a way as not to impair our control of the waters of the Nile and their sources. &quot; We could not,&quot; he added, &quot; possibly consent to the passing of Lake Tsana under any control but our own if Ethiopia broke up.&quot; .... In a note of November 1919 the Italians, in effect, recognised the inevitability of this by referring to the ultimate delimitation of &quot; a territorial zone, to be recognised as pertaining to Great Britain in respect of the latter&apos;s predominant hydraulic interests &quot; in this area.(b) Anglo-Ethiopian Treaty of Amity and Commerce,  with SupplementaryA greement, 1897 (commonly known as the Rennell Eodd Treaty).The supplementary agreement laid down the frontier between British Somaliland and Ethiopia (leaving Harrar and the Ogaden country in Ethiopia), but stated that the tribes on either side of the line should have the right to use the grazing grounds on the other side, being subject to the appropriate territorial authority during their migrations. This provision is of great importance so far as British protected tribes are concerned, since many of them are wholly or partly dependent during certain times of the year on grazing grounds in Ethiopian territory.(c) Franco-Ethiopia Treaty of March 1897.This determined the frontier between Ethiopia and French Somaliland.(d) Anglo-Ethiopian Treaty of May 1902.This defined the frontier between Ethiopia and the Sudan. In this treaty the Ethiopian Government also engaged (i) not to construct or allow to be constructed any work across the Blue Nile, Lake Tsana or the Sobat which would arrest the flow of their waters to the Nile; (ii) to lease a site near Itang to the Sudan Government for a commercial station; (iii) to grant the right to construct a railway through Ethiopian territory connecting the Sudan with Uganda.(e) Italian-Ethiopian Treaties of 1897, 1900 and 1908.These regulated the frontiers between Ethiopia and Italian Somaliland and Eritrea.(f) The Tripartite A greement of 1906.Some reference has already been made to this, which is the most important diplomatic instrument affecting Ethiopia. It was signed by Italy, England and France, and was accepted (albeit reluctantly) by Menelik. Its main object was to record agreement as to and to safeguard the particular economic interests of the three countries in Ethiopia, both in the event of a continuance of the Ethiopian Empire or in the event of &quot;a change in the situation arising in Ethiopia,&quot; i.e., a break-up or a division of the Empire. Its preamble states that it is &quot; the common interest of France, Great Britain and Italy to maintain intact the integrity of Ethiopia,&quot; and article 1 provides that the three Powers shall co-operate in maintaining the &apos;&apos; political and territorial status quo as determined by the state of affairs at present existing,&quot; and by various agreements (including the Anglo-Italian protocols of 1891 and of 1894). Article 4 provides that if the status quo is disturbed, the three Powers shall &quot; make every effort to preserve the integrity of Ethiopia,&quot; and that in any case they should act together to safeguard their special interests, which are defined as being (a) The interests of Great Britain and Egypt in the Nile Basin, more especially as regards the regulation of the waters of that river and its tributaries.
(&amp;) The interests of Italy in Ethiopia as regards Eritrea and Somaliland, more especially with reference to the hinterland of her possessions and the territorial connexion between them to the west of Addis Ababa. (Article 9 of the agreement contains a provision concerning railway connexion west of Addis Ababa between Eritrea and Italian Somaliland.)(c) The interests of France in Ethiopia as regards the hinterland of French Somaliland and the zone necessary for the construction and working of the railway from Jibuti to Addis Ababa.The disturbance of the status quo is, of course, a euphemism for the break-up of Ethiopia; hence this article is of considerable importance as defining, admittedly in a vague way, what interests are recognised and safeguarded by treaty in such an eventuality.(g) Anglo-Italian Exchange of Notes respecting Lake Tsana, 1925.In this exchange of notes Italy undertook to support a British request for the grant of a concession from the Government of Ethiopia for the construction of the Lake Tsana barrage, with the right to construct a motor road from the Sudan frontier to the barrage. In return His Majesty&apos;s Government undertook to support an Italian request for a concession to construct a railway from Eritrea to Italian Somaliland (to the west of Addis Ababa), and, moreover (provided that the Lake Tsana concession were obtained), His Majesty&apos;s Government was prepared to recognise &quot; an exclusive Italian economic influence in the west of Ethiopia and in the whole of the territory to be covered by the above-mentioned railway,&quot; it being understood that the Italians would not construct on the head waters of the Nile or its tributaries any works which might sensibly modify their flow.(It may &quot;be noted that in refuting the charge that this agreement was an attempt to exert unfair pressure on Ethiopia, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs denied that it &apos;&apos; reserved &apos;&apos; any part of Ethiopia to Italian economic influence, and stated that the agreement imposed no obligation on anyone except the British Government, &apos;&apos; who, in return for the Italian undertaking in regard to Lake Tsana, engaged not to compete or to support competition with Italian enterprise in the region specified.&quot;)(h) Ethiopian-Italian Treaty of Friendship, 1928.This treaty declared that there should be &apos;&apos; continual peace and perpetual friendship &quot; between Italy and Ethiopia and that neither Government would under any pretext &quot; take any action which may prejudice or damage the independence of the other.&quot; Should any dispute arise between them not susceptible to settlement by the ordinary diplomatic procedure, it would be submitted to a &quot;procedure of conciliation or arbitration.&quot; The treaty also bound the two Governments to develop and promote commerce between the two countries; and in pursuance of this clause, a supplementary convention was signed at the same time providing for the construction of a motor road from Dessieh to the port of Assab in Eritrea and for the cession to Ethiopia of a free zone at Assab. The portion of the road between Assab and the Eritrean frontier was to be constructed by Italy, and the portion between the frontier and Dessieh by the Ethiopian Government or by a company acting on their behalf. An Italian-Ethiopian company was to be formed and was to have the sole right of transporting goods and passengers over the road.No effect has been given to the arrangements provided for in this convention. The Italians attribute this to Ethiopian procrastination and intransigence; the Ethiopians&apos; answer is that the experts appointed, in accordance with the terms of the convention, to decide the technical problems connected with the construc-tion of the road were at complete variance, and that progress has therefore been impossible.(i) Ethiopian Arms Traffic Treaty, 1930.This treaty was concluded between Ethiopia and the three limitrophe Powers England, France and Italy in the hope of ensuring an effective supervision over the trade in arms and munitions in Ethiopia and the adjacent territories.   Such supervision was declared in the preamble to have two objects :
(a) to enable the Emperor of Ethiopia to obtain &quot; all the arms and munitions necessary for the defence of his territories from external aggression and for the preservation of internal order therein &apos;&apos;; and (b) to prevent the menace to the peace of Ethiopia and the adjacent territories caused by the acquisition of arms by unauthorised persons.The treaty is designed to secure the effective supervision desired by providing for the general application to Ethiopia and the adjacent territories of the arrangements laid down in the Convention for the Supervision of the International Trade in Arms and Munitions and in Implements of &quot;War signed in June 1925, which convention has not, however, come into force. The general effect of these arrangements is that the transit of arms and munitions to Ethiopia through the adjacent territories is only allowed if the articles are consigned to the order of the central Ethiopian Government; special provisions are included relating to the marking of all fire-arms so consigned and to the publication of periodical returns by all the Administrations concerned. An important proviso to article 9 of the treaty gives the three limitrophe Powers the right to refuse to authorise the transit of arms and munitions to Ethiopia &quot; if the attitude or disturbed condition of Ethiopia constitutes a threat to peace or public order,&quot; although this refusal could not be maintained &apos;&apos; in cases where arms and ammuni-tion are necessary to enable the legitimate authorities in Ethiopia to ensure the maintenance of public order.&quot;(j) Italian-French A greement of January 7, 1935.In this agreement (which was made by a secret exchange of letters between Signor Mussolini and M. Laval) the French Government stated that, in so far as the French interests recognised by the Tripartite Treaty of 1906, together with the interests mentioned in the various agreements specified in article 1 of the treaty, were concerned, the French Government would not pursue in Ethiopia the development of any interest other than the economic interests connected with the Jibuti Railway in a specified zone, covering territory on both sides of the railway.It is understood that the effect and importance of this agreement are inter-preted differently in Italy and France. By the Italians it has been apparently regarded as meaning that (subject to the recognition of French economic interests in the railway zone) France will tacitly acquiesce in whatever action Italy may take vis-a-vis Ethiopia; by M. Laval, however, it has been categorically stated that it means no more than that France renounces economic aims in Ethiopia outside the specified zone, in the same way as His Majesty&apos;s Government has been prepared to renounce economic aims in the west of Ethiopia under the 1925 exchange of notes.21. It might be mentioned that His Majesty&apos;s Government have recently contemplated the conclusion of a treaty with Ethiopia whereby in exchange for the cession of the port of Zeila, in British Somaliland, and a corridor connecting-it with Ethiopia, territorial concessions would be made by Ethiopia on the northern borders of British Somaliland (i.e., territory in Ethiopia habitually used by British tribes for grazing), and possibly some similar territorial con-cessions on the Kenya and Sudan frontiers. Negotiations concerning this proposed treaty have, however, been completely suspended in view of the recent Ethiopia-Italian dispute, which concerns the particular area of territory which it was proposed to transfer to British Somaliland.22. The general effect of the treaties and agreements mentioned above may be summarised as follows : (1) Great Britain, Italy and France have formally agreed to &quot; make every effort to preserve the integrity of Ethiopia.&quot;(2) The three Powers have agreed that, if Ethiopia is broken up, they will act together to safeguard certain specified interests. So far as Great Britain is concerned, those interests relate to the Nile Basin &quot; more especially as regards the regulation of the waters of the river and its tributaries.&quot;(3) Great Britain has undertaken that, if a concession is given for the construction of the Lake Tsana barrage, Italy shall have an exclusive economic influence in the west of Ethiopia and in the territory to be crossed by the Eritrea-Italian Somaliland Railway.    France has[120211 c 2
undertaken that she will confine her aims in Ethiopia to the satis-faction of economic interests connected with the traffic of the Jibuti Railway in a specified zone. (4) The Italians still regard practically all Ethiopia as an Italian sphere of influence, except for the special interests of Great Britain in Lake Tsana and the Nile Basin and of France as regards the Jibuti Railway.23. It seems desirable to conclude this section of the report by summarising briefly statements made in the past as regards British policy towards Ethiopia. It has already been pointed out that the Tripartite Agreement of 1906 states that the United Kingdom, France and Italy &quot; shall co-operate in maintaining the territorial and political status quo in Ethiopia as determined by the state of affairs at present existing &apos;&apos; and that, if the status quo is disturbed, the three Powers shall make &quot; every effort to preserve the integrity of Ethiopia.&quot; In the discussions in the House of Commons (August 1926) following the Anglo-Italian exchange of notes of 1925 it was implied that no threat to Ethiopian sovereignty was intended and that the &quot; Ethiopian Government had a perfect right to judge of what was in the interests of Ethiopia.&quot; In 1927, in a memorandum (unpublished) handed to him concerning the Tsana dam, the Emperor of Ethiopia was assured that any agreement in regard to the dam &quot; would in no way affect the existing entire independence of the Empire of Ethiopia, maintenance of which is a cardinal point in the policy of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot; In the preamble to the Ethiopian Arms Traffic Treaty of 1930 it is stated that the four Powers concerned (Great Britain, Italy, France and Ethiopia) were equally desirous &quot;of enabling His Majesty the Emperor of Ethiopia to obtain all the arms and ammunitions necessary for the defence of his territories from external aggression.&quot;So far as material interests in Ethiopia itself are concerned, it is clear that the control of Lake Tsana and the Nile waters has been regarded as the one fundamental British interest. This was summed up in the following passage of a memorandum sent to His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Addis Ababa in July 1926: &quot;It is essential in the interests of Egypt and the Sudan to prevent outside interference with the courses of the Nile. This consideration has governed the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government for the last thirty years.&quot; In February 1928 the Italian Ambassador called at the Foreign Office to enquire what were the objects of British policy in Ethiopia. He was informed that they were roughly comprised under three heads : (i) Trade : This in itself was small, but the British Indian and British Somali traders had a right to His Majesty&apos;s Governments protection and, in order that the protection might be efficacious, His Majesty&apos;s Government were anxious to concert with other Powers in securing an improvement in the administration of justice in Ethiopia, (ii) Peace on the frontiers : This would be best secured by control over the import of arms, (iii) Lake Tsana: It was pointed out that agreement with Italy on this important interest had been reached in the 1925 correspondence.24. In this section of the report it is proposed to examine the aims of Italian policy in Ethiopia and the underlying motives which determine that policy. It is first necessary, however, to refer briefly to a possibility which, independently of any overt action by the Italians, might necessitate action in order to safeguard British interests in Ethiopia, namely, the possibility that even without any foreign aggression there might be a complete breakdown of the present system of government in Ethiopia, with a relapse to a state of anarchical feudalism and the disappearance of such settled administration as has been achieved.PART II.25. The victory of Adowa in 1896 removed the threat of European aggression from Ethiopia. It did more by making secure the position of Menelik, it enabled him to achieve a considerable degree of internal consolidation. Until the illness which crippled him after 1908, none of his vassals ever ventured seriously to oppose his authority; and his system of abolishing, wherever possible, hereditary governorships (filling the posts with his nominees), of altering provincial boundaries and of maintaining unimpaired the supremacy of the
Shoan army over the armies of the other provinces materially assisted the estab-lishment of a strong central power, such as Ethiopia had never before known. The confusion and dissensions that marked the reign of Lij Yasu led to the weakening of the central authority again : both before his deposition and during the early years of the Empress Zauditu the great provincial chiefs regained much of their power, and the control exercised over them by the Central Government, harassed by constant insurrections and intrigue, became more and more nominal.The post-war period and, in particular, the reign of the present Emperor  has seen a resolute attempt to build up again the power of the central authority and to establish an Administration on modern lines. To a certain degree, this policy has been successful, largely due to the increasing concentration of military power especially the control over modern weapons of war (aeroplanes, &amp;c.) hi the hands of the Central Government. (The Ethiopian Arms Traffic Treaty of 1930 was designed to assist this end.) But while there has been no serious threat to the Emperor&apos;s position, and while his effective control over the whole country has increased since his reign began, the power of the central Government over the great feudal chiefs is still limited, and, indeed, hardly exists at all in matters of day-to-day administration. This is particularly the case in areas remote from Addis Ababa (except in the Emperor&apos;s own country) : defective communications, the maintenance of provincial armies (often well armed), the warlike and restless spirit of the chiefs and the absence of anything in the nature of a public impulse towards good government make the Emperor&apos;s task very difficult and mean that, in the interests of stability, it would be dangerous for him to introduce reforms too rapidly.26. The possibility of a complete breakdown in the power of the central Government is, however, probably remote while the present Emperor lives, provided that he does not follow a policy wholly repugnant to that favoured by the great chiefs. His success in restricting the chiefs and people during the recent months of tension has been remarkable. But his death might be the prelude to a period of complete anarchy. The heir apparent is without strength of character (though the second son still in the early teens is said to show great promise); the ministry and other central institutions have no real authority or prestige in the country; there is nothing in the shape of a body of opinion anxious and determined to maintain a settled central Government; the tendency to internal feud and disintegration which is inherent in Ethiopia would be unchecked. Such a state of chaos might result as would necessitate action by neighbouring European Powers in order to produce a more settled state of affairs : naturally at the present time any such breakdown of Ethiopian Government would play directly into Italian hands.27. It is a commonplace that for some years Italy has revived her &quot;forward&quot; policy vis-a-vis Ethiopia. Despite the guarantee of the integrity of Ethiopia in the Tripartite Agreement of 1906, Ethiopian membership of the League of Nations, and the Ethiopian-Italian Treaty of Friendship of 1928, an attempt by Italy to assume control over the whole or part of Ethiopia must be regarded as definitely probable. The considerations which lead to this view may be summarised briefly as follows :  (i) Ethiopia is felt by Italy to be an anachronism. It is the one tropical African country except Liberia left out of the &quot;scramble.&quot; The failure to establish effective internal government, the continuance of slavery, the disordered state of the border provinces, the cruel treatment of subject races would all be cited lavishly by Italy to enable her to pose as the champion of white civilisation against a State given over to barbarism and incapable of discipline.(ii) It is largely closed to European capitalism and colonisation, and is therefore a constant economic temptation.Apart from the Jibuti-Addis Ababa Railway there are no large scale European enterprises in the country. Trade even before the slump was negligible; in any event the import trade in textiles is in Japanese hands. Concessions are difficult to obtain and are nearly always unprofitable to work owing to Ethiopia administrative incompetence and rapacity. Yet there is almost certainly mineral wealth chiefly gold and platinum in some areas, though probably exaggerated in amount, while the soil in the highlands is fertile and much of the country would probably be suitable for European colonisation.(iii) All this coincides with the frustrated colonial ambitions of Italy and her sense of grievance at the inadequate colonial compensations given to her
after the war. Fascism has brought a recrudescence of Italian imperialism, fostered by the successful pacification of Libya and illustrated by a readiness to spend lavishly on colonies. But Italy came to the &quot; scramble &quot; too late. Ethiopia is the one part of Africa not under the control or virtual protection of another European Power.(iv) The increasing development of Eritrea and Italian Somaliland (especially the latter) has made Italy even more conscious than before of Ethiopia&apos;s defects as a neighbour. Italian expansion in the north-east of Italian Somaliland has resulted in their occupying territory claimed as Ethiopian (i.e., the Walwal area), and there is another possible source of dispute in the Ethiopian control of the headwaters of the Juba and the Webbe Shibeli, the two main rivers of Italian Somaliland, on which there are important irrigation works. The possession of two colonies flanking Ethiopia naturally strengthens the Italian position in the event of war. Incidentally it may be mentioned that the very costly Italian settlement schemes in Libya are said to be now recognised failures;. a fact which makes control over the natural resources of Ethiopia the more tempting.(v) There is the impetus given by historical memories. Under the Treaty of Uccialli Ethiopia became nominally an Italian protectorate; an illusion ended by Adowa. Given the present temper of Italian rulers, the desire to avenge Adowa and re-establish an Italian protectorate always latent has almost certainly gained in strength; it is equivalent to English feeling after the death of Gordon and the Mahdi&apos;s conquest of the Sudan. It is significant that the main comment of the Italian press on the recent anniversary of Adowa was to. the effect that Adowa was only a defeat &quot;because the rulers of that time, not the army, lacked the courage to take their revenge.&quot;(vi) The fact that Germany is again likely to press for some colonial possession or mandate may have increased Italian anxiety to secure control over Ethiopia, which she regards as her natural inheritance. There is the hope that any Italian aggression against Ethiopia would not arouse opposition from any other European Power. England and France are the two Powers most concerned; neither has itself territorial ambitions in Ethiopia; both have good reason to deplore Ethiopian inefficiency and lack of discipline. So far as France is concerned, the recent secret understanding at Rome is taken by Italy to mean that, provided that the one predominant French economic interest in Ethiopia  the exploitation of the Addis Ababa-Jibuti Railway is respected, Italy may have otherwise a free hand in Ethiopia. As regards the United Kingdom, Italy might hope for acquiescence largely because of the knowledge that British interests in Ethiopia were not such as make a policy of active opposition to the detriment of general Anglo-Italian relations likely; and because in 1925 the United Kingdom deliberately sought Italian support for obtaining a concession for the Tsana dam. &quot; World &quot; opinion generally would, of course, be opposed to Italian aggression against Ethiopia, a member of the League of Nations. But it would not be difficult for Italy to arrange that Ethiopia was the ostensible aggressor; she might hope for a certain amount of support on the grounds that Ethiopia was a barbarous country, where slavery and other abuses lingered on; while, in the last resort, she will probably be prepared to defy the League, after the Japanese precedent.28. It seems clear, therefore, that given the above considerations, and given also the present Italian temper and regime, a deliberate effort will be made by Italy to secure a measure of control over Ethiopia within the next few years. Political considerations elsewhere especially the general European situation  or difficulties of domestic finance may involve a postponement of ultimate Italian aims, but it is likely to be only a postponement. It is necessary, therefore, to endeavour to estimate what form attempted Italian control over Ethiopia might take.29. It seems clear that Italy &apos;s ultimate aim is to secure control over all Ethiopia either in direct sovereignty, or by establishing a protectorate akin to Morocco or Tunis; and it may be that, even if it is hoped only to obtain more limited objectives in the first instance, Italy will be tempted or forced by circumstances to try for such complete control in one stage and not gradually. This would not be an easy matter. Despite the Italian superiority in material (especially in aeroplanes), a campaign of conquest followed by successful pacification would
entail the employment over a number of years of a large body of European troops. Probably the defeat of such standing armies as the Ethiopians possess would be relatively easy, but the guerilla warfare which would inevitably follow would be much more difficult to control, especially in view of the physical nature of the country and the fighting qualities of the individual Ethiopian. Certainly it is difficult to suppose that Italy could hope to conduct a successful campaign having as its object the conquest and ultimate control of all Ethiopia with a force of less than 200,000 men. It may well be, therefore, that Italy has had in mind the immediate achievement of more limited aims, such as :  (a) A limited expansion of the borders of Italian Somaliland by the effectiveoccupation of lowland country, where the Ethiopians have never tried to introduce regular administration. This is land of little intrinsic value (though the grazing is better than in British or Italian Somaliland), but the successful acquisition of territory for the retention of which, incidentally, Ethiopia would certainly not fight a prolonged war would enhance Italian prestige at home and abroad.(b) The acquisition of economic &quot;concessions&quot; in Ethiopia, leading toan economic hegemony over the country under the existing regime. The proposed Italian concession for which British support was promised in 1925 was the construction of a railway west of Addis Ababa to link Italian Somaliland and Eritrea. It is difficult to believe that the Italians now take this project seriously; what they have probably contemplated is a series of mining and land concessions given to Italians, possibly including areas for Italian colonisation, and the grant of loans from Italian funds. The provision of financial assistance on a large scale in a country like Ethiopia might well lead, as it did in Egypt, to virtual political control. It is doubtful how far such concessions would pay, but they would give Italy a foothold in the country and would be the stepping-stone to1 an extension of political power.(c) It is possible that the Italians have contemplated working for the replacement of the present Emperor by an Italian puppet, forced to take Italian loans and advisers. There have been indications that Italian agents with Italian money have been tampering with the loyalty of chiefs known to be hostile to the Emperor; in an interview with Sir E. Drummond, Signor Mussolini referred significantly to the possible replacement of the present Emperor by another less intransigent. It is possible that a policy of subsidising a rival to the Emperor, intelligently carried out, might have given Italy virtual control over Ethiopia without the necessity of sending or retaining large forces there.30. It is, of course, very difficult to predict what will happen in the immediate future; but it seems clear that airy hopes that may have been entertained by Italy of securing a position of control over Ethiopia, either by a policy of friendly approach or as a result of an impressive display of military strength without a war, will be doomed to failure. In other words, (&amp;) and (c) above appear unlikely of fulfilment, unless as a result of a war. The Ethiopians have shown no sign of yielding to the Italian demands because of any fear of Italian military strength. The chief result of Italian sabre-rattling has been to intensify and confirm Ethiopian suspicions of Italy (always latent since Adowa), and also to make world opinion watchful and suspicious. In Ethiopian eyes Italy now stands fully revealed as the enemy; and the Emperor could not hope to command acceptance for any peaceful settlement with Italy which would be humiliating to Ethiopian pride and independence, even if he were pressed to do so by disinterested foreign Powers anxious to see peace preserved. And though attempts to tamper with the loyalty of the great chiefs, and even with that of members of the Emperor&apos;s family, may be made, it seems very doubtful whether any chief known to be favourable to, or in the hands of, the Italians, could hope to replace the present Emperor unless he was backed by strong Italian armies ready to put down all opposition in other words, Italian forces under him, in effect, to conquer and to control the State for their puppet. Thus it seems clear that Italy can only hope now to obtain a commanding position in Ethiopia by force of arms.
PART III.33. It is convenient to consider what British interests would be affected and to what extent (a) By an Italian occupation of the Ogaden plateau country adjoining Italian Somaliland, i.e., up to the Harar hills, or including Harar itself.(6) By an Italian conquest of all Ethiopia.34. As regards (a), only one vital British interest is concerned the. freedom of the British-protected tribes from British Somaliland to graze and water in their habitual grazing areas across the frontier in what is now Ethiopian territory. The right to do this is secured, so far as Ethiopia is. concerned, by the Rennell Rodd Treaty of 1897 but the Italians on the British Somaliland-Italian Somaliland frontier have, despite reiterated protests from His Majesty&apos;s Government, refused to allow British-protected tribes to cross the frontier to their habitual grazing grounds a policy which has inflicted much loss-and suffering on the tribes in question. It is essential that no such impediment should be placed by the Italians on the exercise by British tribes of their right to cross to their habitual grazing grounds in what is now Ethiopian territory, since.31. Consequently the indications are that any prospect of the peaceful establishment of a veiled Italian protectorate has become remote. Either Italy will have to accept the continuance of the status quo, with an Ethiopia thoroughly hostile to and suspicious of Italy, or she will have to endeavour to secure her aims-by force of arms. It may be that in the first instance efforts will be confined to-securing a limited acquisition of territory in the areas adjacent to Italian Somali-land, leaving a diminished but independent Ethiopia to be attacked again at a later date; alternatively, as stated in paragraph 29, Italy may be tempted or forced by circumstances to try for the &quot; grand slam &quot; and to secure control over all Ethiopia by force of arms. It is difficult to believe that, in the long run, Italy would remain content with the acquisition of only comparatively worthless territory adjacent to Italian Somaliland; in other words, sooner or later she will try for the &quot;grand slam&quot; and it is hard to see how this could be attained in any other way than by a successful war.32.   To sum up this part of the report : (i) Ethiopia has still not achieved internal solidarity or an effective-Central Government, (ii) The death of the Emperor might lead to a state of chaos.(iii) An Italian attempt to gain control over Ethiopia (or a large part of it)is very likely. /(iv) Events in the last few months have made it doubtful whether that control could now be achieved by a policy of gradual encroachment and economic penetration.(v) Therefore Italy will have to embark on a war if she is to secure heraims.(vi) The possibilities appear to be (a). The continuance of the status quo.(b) Absorption by Italy, after a short and successful war, of a portionof low-lying territory adjacent to Italian Somaliland (and possibly including Harar). (It seems very doubtful whether  in view of the elaborate preparations which have been made  Mussolini could now afford to withdraw from the present dispute without some such gain of territory.)(c) An Italian war of aggression, aiming at the control not only ofoutlying provinces but of the whole of Ethiopia.(vii) It has been assumed, in the sections of the report which follow, that Italy would be successful in establishing control over Ethiopia if a war breaks out, and our conclusions are based on that assumption. This is not to say, however, that a sweeping Italian victory is a foregone conclusion; it might even be that the Ethiopians, as in 1896,. would successfully withstand Italian aggression.
the tribes in question are very largely dependent on that grazing during certain periods of the year. If they were to be forcibly excluded from those grazing grounds by the Italians, not only would they suffer severely, but they would consider that the Government of British Somaliland had failed to safeguard their rights, and a very difficult internal situation might well -arise in British Somaliland itself. Indeed, the Governor of British Somaliland has gone so far as to state that, unless these rights can be safeguarded, it will be impossible to administer British Somaliland except with a greatly increased garrison. The present position is that it is hoped to begin ad hoc negotiations between the authorities in British and Italian Somaliland with a view to the conclusion of a working arrangement to allow British-protected tribes free access to wells and grazing grounds in territory west of 470 at present in Italian occupation  without prejudice to the question of whether the territory belongs de jure to Italy or to Ethiopia. There is some hope that, at all events for the present, the Italians will raise no difficulties on this point; but experience of their harsh policy on the British Somaliland-Italian Somaliland frontier must make for apprehension as to their future action should they establish definite control in the whole of the area to the south of British Somaliland. It is therefore of great importance that if this area passes under Italian control, His Majesty&apos;s Government should take effective measures to secure the rights of British tribes to the unimpeded use of their habitual grazing grounds in the whole of this area.35. Apart from this, no vital British interest would be affected by Italian acquisition of the Ogaden area: but this might react on British interests generally in the following way : (a) The acquisition of this additional territory by the Italians, especially if it were made after a successful war and if it comprised the important Harar area, would naturally enhance Italian prestige with the local Somali tribes, and this fact would tend to make the task of the British Somaliland Administration, which in the last resort depends for its existence on prestige, more difficult, especially as the Italians are prepared to spend money freely while the expenditure of the British Somaliland Government is kept to the minimum consonant with the maintenance of British control. Concurrently, British prestige in (the diminished) Ethiopia might be affected adversely if the Ethiopians thought that we could have done more to prevent Italian encroach-ment in their territory, and this would render it difficult to obtain satisfaction from the Ethiopians in such matters as frontier disputes and the like.(b) British Somaliland would be practically surrounded by Italian territory, instead of being flanked over a large part of its boundary by the weak power of Ethiopia. In some ways this might be an advantage in that Italian control of unruly border tribes would probably be more effective than that of Ethiopia : but (i) This would largely depend on what attitude the Italians adoptedregarding the grazing rights of British tribes.(ii) British Somaliland, in the unlikely event of a war with Italy, would beimpossible to defend, whereas at present Ethiopia can be looked on as a potential ally in such a war which would prevent Italy from taking action against British Somaliland.(c) In Harar and the adjoining area there are a number of British Indian traders and other British subjects or protected persons (Somalis or Arabs) engaged in trade, partly in connexion with the export of coffee and skins, partly in the retail cotton goods trade, though the sum total of British interests in this area cannot be called substantial. It is practically certain, judging from experience elsewhere (e.g., Jubaland), that the Italians, if they took this area, would make it impossible (by indirect methods and discrimination) for these people to continue their trading successfully. Similarly, the Ethiopia-British Somaliland transit trade would in all probability be adversely affected, since the Italians would probably try to force goods to travel by routes in Italian territory. The trade is of no great value (about  80,000 a year), but its loss would be unfortunate for Somaliland, which cannot afford to lose any trade or revenue.(d) Effective Italian occupation of this area would make quite impossible any territorial adjustments with Ethiopia such as that recently contemplated whereby
the grazing areas frequented by British-protected tribes in the Walwal area would be added to British Somaliland in return for the cession of Zeila. Such an exchange would have been an advantageous one so far as Somaliland is concerned; it would have made secure the grazing areas frequented by British tribes. But it has been already recognised that the present Italian occupation of these same areas and the likelihood of its continuance has probably rendered such an exchange of territory quite out of the question there would be little hope of obtaining it from the Italians. In a memorandum prepared just after the war on the possible division of Ethiopia, Sir Geoffrey Archer (the Governor of Somaliland) urged that the area round Harar should be added to British Somaliland. The acquisition of Harar and the fertile areas round it might seem attractive : but there are no grounds on which we could claim that we, and not the Italians, should take possession of it, and it cannot be maintained that Harar is of such vital consequence to British Somaliland that it is not possible to contemplate its occupation by another European Power. On the other hand, there is an area to the south of British Somaliland, east of the French &apos;&apos; railway zone &apos;&apos; (which does not include Harar or the Walwal-Wardeir area), which is within the British sphere of influence as laid down in the 1894 protocol. It would presumably be possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to claim some &quot; rights &quot; over that area if the status quo in that part of Ethiopia adjacent to British Somaliland is disturbed by an Italian invasion and occupation. It might not be considered desirable to add this area to British Somaliland (it would give some welcome additional grazing areas, though it includes little permanent water) : but the existence of British &quot; rights &quot; over this area should be of value if it becomes necessary to bargain with the Italians on other points.36. An Italian conquest of all Ethiopia would manifestly affect much wider British interests than an Italian occupation of the compatively low-lying country adjoining British Somaliland. These interests may most conveniently be examined under the following heads :  (a) Strategic considerations.(b) Lake Tsana.(c) Trade.(d) Neighbouring British dependencies and the interests of the Sudan.(a) Strategic Considerations.37. The main factors which would have to be taken into account in the event of the assumption by Italy of full territorial sovereignty over Ethiopia may be summarised as follows : (i) Neighbouring British dependencies (including the Sudan) will have acontiguous land frontier of over 2,000 miles with territory under control of a first-class European Power.(ii) The organisation of Italian colonial forces in North-East Africa might,in the unlikely event of war with Italy, constitute a more serious threat than at present to our strategical position in the Red Sea.Normally in peace a frontier with a first-class European Power is to be preferred to a frontier with a semi-civilised nation, since the strong Power will more effectively control the inhabitants. Local administration is made easier since a civilised Power with orthodox views on the rigidity of demarcated frontiers may be expected to discourage the petty incidents which frequently give rise to friction in less civilised borderlands. This is true of the frontiers of our possessions in Africa which are contiguous with territory in the possession of France, Belgium and Portugal; and it would probably hold true if Italy assumed control over Ethiopia. That is to say provided that satisfactory arrangements could be made in regard to the grazing rights of British protected tribes. There would almost certainly be a decrease in the number of the frontier &quot; incidents,&quot; which, owing to the inadequate control of the Emperor over the frontier tribes, have been of such frequent occurrence in the past and in respect of which no lasting improvement can be expected until the Emperor&apos;s control has become more effective.
38. These frontier incidents, however, while a source of constant embarrass-ment to the local administrations, seldom present any serious military problem. The local forces available for frontier defence are as follows : (a) In the Sudan : two infantry companies and one camel company, Sudan Defence Force.(6) In Kenya : one weak battalion of King&apos;s African Rifles strength under 500 men and detachment from the Uganda Battalion (about 100 men), (c) In British Somaliland: 500 men of the Camel Corps.These forces have hitherto been found sufficient to cope with the problems on the frontier. Should local frontier disorders lead to a serious dispute with Ethiopia, it is unlikely that the Emperor would contemplate challenging our military strength. Not only has Ethiopia no idea of territorial aggrandisement, but the Ethiopians dislike fighting outside their highland areas. The armed forces of Ethiopia, therefore, constitute no potential threat to adjacent British territories. Should Italy become settled in Ethiopia the situation would be different. We should have as a neighbour the colonial administration of a very ambitious European Power, whose activities in recent years have shown that she is constantly on the alert to make and seize any opportunity of territorial aggrandisement.The colonial forces which Italy would maintain in an Italian Ethiopia would be a more powerful weapon than the existing Ethiopian army, which is really only formidable when operating in the hilly country of Ethiopia itself. These colonial forces would be officered by Italians and, judging from the colonial Italian forces in Libya and Eritrea, would be provided with modern arms and equipment. The existence of such forces coupled with the vulnerability of a land frontier of over 2,000 miles with an aggressive European military Power would be a serious potential threat to the Sudan, Kenya and British Somaliland. In peace time alone the military situation might compel us to revise our ideas of defence requirements for these territories.39. Although by no means an exact parallel, there is some similarity between Ethiopia and Afghanistan. The attitude of Afghanistan has always been the disturbing feature of the military problem of the North-West Frontier of India. An intractable Afghanistan, however, was preferable as a neighbour to Imperial Russia, and consequently the integrity of Afghanistan was for generations a vital factor in British frontier policy in India.40. Reference has already been made to the difficulty which would be experienced in defending British Somaliland in the event of a war with Italy if it is practically surrounded by Italian territory. If British Somaliland were to fall into the hands of a hostile Italy, the ports of Berbera, Zeila and other roadsteads would be of value to Italy as anchorages for submarines attacking shipping in the approaches to the Gulf of Aden; and, indeed, generally, Italian expansion in this area would strengthen Italy&apos;s strategical position vis-a-vis Aden, since although the possession of Eritrea already gives her bases from which air attack on the Red Sea shipping and on Aden itself could be launched, it is probable that, if Ethiopia were conquered, considerably stronger army and air forces would be maintained than those at present located in Eritrea and Italian Somaliland. Moreover, at present, in the event of a war with Italy, Italian forces in Eritrea and Italian Somaliland would be virtually neutralised owing to the necessity of guarding against an intervention by Ethiopia on our side.41. On the other hand, it is probable that the conquest and consolidation of Ethiopia would necessitate the employment of a considerable garrison (which would have to have a stiffening of Italian troops) for a number of years; and it would be safe to assume that during that time the Italian &apos;&apos; drive &quot; for expansion would be halted. But although it is admittedly a possibility remote in time  the danger of a further urge for expansion after Italy has succeeded in consolidating her position in Ethiopia cannot be wholly excluded. Whatever arrangements were made to protect British interests in Lake Tsana and the Nile Basin, there would be a temptation to Italy it being assumed that the possession of Ethiopia does not satiate her colonial ambitions to push her power towards the Sudan and so to threaten our vital interest in controlling the upper waters of the Nile. To sum up, from the point of view of imperial defence, it would be preferable if Ethiopia could remain an independent country, and while effective Italian control (assuming always that our interests in Lake Tsana were amply
safeguarded) would not directly and immediately threaten any vital British interest, the balance of power in this area would be altered- to Italy&apos;s advantage and a possible, if remote, threat to British control over the Sudan and the upper waters of the Nile must be taken into account.(b) Lake Tsana.42. Reference has already been made in Part I of this report to the Anglo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1902, in which the Emperor Menelik undertook that the Ethiopian Government would not construct, or allow to be constructed, any work across Lake Tsana, the Blue Nile or the Sobat which would arrest their flow into the Nile, except by agreement with His Majesty&apos;s Government or the Government of the Sudan.It is not necessary to recapitulate in detail the history of the negotiations which have for over thirty years taken place in regard to the Lake Tsana project, namely, that a barrage should be constructed at the lake in order to retain its waters, and that the surplus waters should be rented to the Governments of Egypt and the Sudan.The more recent history can be briefly summarised as follows. In 1928, His Majesty&apos;s Government stated that they would be prepared to negotiate on the revised basis put forward by the Ethiopian Government, namely, that they themselves (the Ethiopian Government) would arrange for the construction of the barrage and would then hire the water to the Sudan Government. Accordingly, in 1930 a survey party was sent to the lake by the J. G. White Engineering Corporation the American firm to which the Ethiopian Government proposed to entrust the construction of the barrage the expenses being provisionally borne by the Sudan Government. Subsequently, in 1931, the Sudan Government stated that, owing to the uncertain outlook for Gezira cotton, it was unlikely that they would have any immediate use for Lake Tsana water, and that they were reluctant to incur any further expenditure on the scheme at that time. They wished, however, to retain their footing in the project; and it was accordingly decided that the co-operation of the Egyptian Government should be obtained. It was finally agreed (a) that further investigations should be undertaken at Lake Tsana, the cost to be borne by the Government of Egypt (&amp;) that the project should henceforward be a joint one, both Egypt and the Sudan to share the water from the barrage in agreed proportions, although the Government of Egypt stated that it was improbable that Egypt would be able to think of proceeding with the construction of the barrage for many years to come. In September 1933 Messrs. White sent a further survey party to the lake, at the expense of the Egyptian Government. Their report has just been received and is now under consideration by the Governments concerned.43.   The present position thus is (a) Surveys of the lake (and of routes for the two roads Lake Tsana-Sudanfrontier, Lake Tsana-Addis Ababa which are part of the scheme) have been completed; and Messrs. White have prepared three alternative schemes for the barrage.(b) Their report is still under consideration, and no immediate resumptionof negotiations with the Ethiopian Government is likely.(c) Of recent years, the attitude of the Ethiopian Government in the matterof the barrage project has been much more accommodating; and it is not expected that there will be any difficulty in coming to a general agreement concerning its construction, although a settlement of the necessary financial arrangements might well prove troublesome.(d) It is unlikely, despite the measure of improvement which has occurred in the economic and financial situation, that the Governments of Egypt or of the Sudan will desire the immediate construction of the barrage and the ancillary works, having regard to the heavy capital and recurrent expenditure which would be involved, and of the fact that neither Government is likely to have an immediate use for additional water from Lake Tsana owing to a natural reluctance to expand the areas under cotton.44. Nevertheless, despite the fact that the immediate execution of the barrage is probably out of the question for the reasons stated above, the safe-guarding of British and Egyptian interests in the matter of Lake Tsana and
the waters of the Blue Nile and the Sobat both for their present and potential importance must still remain the most vital concern of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Ethiopia; and it is essential that no step should be taken, or omitted, which would endanger the maintenance of those interests or which would make the construction of the proposed barrage (which may still be of immense importance in the economy of the Sudan and Egypt) more difficult or more onerous to the Governments concerned. It is important to emphasise that it is not only the interests of the Sudan which are concerned, but the vital interests also of Egypt. Egypt has contributed heavily in the past and still contributes to-day to the condominium in the Sudan for practical and substantial reasons. His Majesty&apos;s Government is bound, in effect, to stand as guarantor of Egyptian interests in this matter; they cannot be allowed to suffer by our default. Under the Tripartite Agreement of 1906 it is laid down that, if the status quo of Ethiopia is disturbed, Italy and France will recognise the special British interests in the matter of Lake Tsana and the Nile Basin. Similarly in the exchange of notes of 1925 Italy again recognised the predominant interest of His Majesty&apos;s Government in this area. It might be urged, therefore, that His Majesty&apos;s Governments position was amply safeguarded in the event of an Italian conquest of Ethiopia and that the Italian Government would not only refrain from interfering with the present flow of the waters, but would be ready (perhaps more ready) than the Ethiopian Government to permit and to co-operate in the construction of the barrage. Similarly it might be urged that the control of Ethiopia by a civilised Administra-tion would render the barrage more secure; while the Italians might well be easier to deal with than the Ethiopians in other ways, e.g., in regard to the administrative control of the barrage. Such, however, is the actual and potential importance of Lake Tsana and the Nile Basin to British and Egyptian interests that the conclusion is irresistible that so powerful an economic weapon should not be allowed to pass into Italian hands. In other words, it appears essentia] that should Ethiopia be about to pass under Italian control, and should the general diplomatic situation make such a course practicable, His Majesty&apos;s Government should follow the policy made explicit by Sir E. Grey in 1913 and should notify the Italian Government that territorial sovereignty over Lake Tsana and an area linking it with the Sudan cannot be allowed to pass into the hands of another European Power.45. It is, of course, impossible in this report to indicate the precise extent of the area in respect of which such an arrangement should be made. There would, however, be no need to oppose Italian occupation of the area through which the Blue Nile flows south of Lake Tsana, since it is understood to be physically impossible for works causing a diminished flow of the Nile to be constructed in the Blue Nile valley. Thus it would suffice, to secure effective control, to &quot; reserve &quot; the area round Lake Tsana itself plus a suitable corridor of territory linking it to the Sudan, subject to a special agreement whereby Italy would undertake not to erect any works on the Sobat and other tributaries of the Nile which would not fall within the &quot; reserved &quot; areaj1)The exact form in which sovereignty over this area could be exercised if it is excluded from an Italian Ethiopia is a matter which falls outside the scope of this report; the simplest procedure and one which, at any rate in form, would recognise the substantial Egyptian interests involved would be to add it to the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. .46. If for any reason it is impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to insist that this area should not pass under Italian control, then it is essential that confirmation should be obtained from Italy of her earlier undertakings to respect the predominant British interests in Lake Tsana and the Nile Basin. And not only should His Majesty&apos;s Government insist on the safeguarding of such interests (i.e., that without the concurrence of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Egyptian Government no work should be constructed on Lake Tsana, the Blue Nile and the Sobat which would affect the flow of their waters into the Nile), but His Majestj^s Government should clearly refuse to admit that conditions (e.g., as to the rent to be recovered from the Sudan and Egypt for the Tsana water or as to the construction of the Lake Tsana-Addis Ababa road) legitimately demanded by the Ethiopian Govern-ment, which His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to accept as coming(J) In reference to paragraph 45, see Mr. Macgregor&apos;s note added as appendix to this report (p. 30).   (Note by Foreign 0$ce.)
from that Government, could be maintained as they stand if the Italian Government wrested authority from the Emperor. In other words, failing actual territorial control over the Lake Tsana area, His Majesty&apos;s Government should at least insist, as of right, having regard to earlier Italian undertakings, on the most favourable possible terms being granted in the event of the construction of the barrage and the ancillary works.(c) Trade.47. A brief summary of British trade and financial interests in Ethiopia has been given in part I of this report. The direct trade and financial interests of the United Kingdom are negligible and, so far as can be foreseen, likely to remain so, although some development might result if the Lake Tsana barrage were constructed. Nor is there any sufficient evidence to justify the view that the unexploited mineral wealth of Ethiopia is likely to be so important that His Majesty&apos;s Government should endeavour to secure a share in its development for British interests. Of more importance but still relatively insignificant is the Indian trade with Ethiopia, the direct and transit trade with the Sudan and British Somaliland, and the interests of British Indian and British Somali merchants established in Ethiopia.48. As has been stated, no substantial increase in British trade interests can be expected; indeed, the direct interest of the United Kingdom may well diminish still further in the face of Japanese competition. The transit trade with the Sudan and Somaliland, on the other hand, is likely to increase gradually with improved conditions in Ethiopia. It might be urged that an Italian conquest of Ethiopia would stimulate trade and provide new openings for British commerce hitherto closed owing to the backward state of Ethiopia. Experience in present Italian colonies, however, renders this most unlikely; trade with these colonies is normally directed, by means of heavy discriminatory tariffs and other devices, into purely Italian channels and is carried by Italian ships. At present Italian and British goods compete on the Ethiopia market on equal terms; but it is too much to hope that any such policy of the &quot; open door &quot; would be maintained if Ethiopia passed under Italian sovereignty, and the most probable result of the establishment of Italian control in Ethiopia would be the virtual extinction of direct United Kingdom trade, especially the export trade from this country, and discriminatory measures against the transit trade with British Somaliland and the Sudan. In short, it is considered that, on balance, British trade interests, although in themselves insignificant in existing circumstances, would stand to lose if Italy assumed control over Ethiopia. Similarly, there is some danger that if Italy were successful in developing coffee-planting on an extended scale, coffee from Ethiopia would compete severely with Kenya coffee on the world market. The same consideration, indeed, might hold true of other tropical products, e.g., cotton or sisal although it would take a longer time for the Italians to develop these successfully. It would naturally be important, should Italy obtain control over Ethiopia, that His Majesty&apos;s Government should use every endeavour to secure from the Italians agreement to respect the policy of the &quot; open door &quot; and to refrain from discriminatory measures against British merchants engaged in trade in Addis Ababa and elsewhere; but, as stated above, it is unlikely that, in point of fact, it would be possible in practice to maintain equality of opportunity as between British and Italian commercial interests.(d) Effect on Neighbouring Dependencies under British Control.49. Reference has already been made to the probable effect on British Somaliland of an Italian occupation of the area immediately adjoining its southern boundary; and it has been emphasised that it would be essential, in such an event, to endeavour to secure recognition of the right of British tribes to graze and water freely in their habitual grazing grounds in what is now Ethiopian territory. The question whether an attempt should also be made to secure a rectification of the British Somaliland frontier by the inclusion of the territory allotted as a &quot; sphere of influence &quot; to Great Britain in the 1894 Anglo-Italian Agreement has also been mentioned and is discussed further below; while the section of the report preceding this included a brief examination of the effect of an Italian occupation of Ethiopia on trade with neighbouring dependencies, under British control.
50. It is now desirable to consider more generally the effect on neighbouring dependencies of an Italian absorption of the whole of Ethiopia. While, as has already been stated, the establishment of effective Italian control over Ethiopia would constitute a threat to the security of neighbouring British possessions (especially British Somaliland) in the event of a war with Italy, in matters of day-to-day administration the substitution of Italian rule on the frontiers for Ethiopia would, on balance, operate to the advantage of the neighbouring territories. It is true that the Italians have proved difficult and unaccommo-dating as regards trans-frontier grazing by British protected tribes on the British Somaliland frontier, while on the Kenya-Italian Somaliland frontier there have been certain difficulties as a result of Italian propaganda among British tribes. But it is reasonable to assume that some part, at least, of the unaccommodating Italian attitude on these frontiers has been due to the Italians&apos; sense of grievance at their inadequate colonial possessions, and that satisfaction of their ambitions by the acquisition of Ethiopia would materially ease relations. And there can be no doubt of the relief with which the establishment of efficient frontier administration would be greeted by neighbouring Administrations. Although there has of recent years been an improvement in Ethiopian control of the frontier districts (particularly those bordering on British Somaliland), conditions generally remain most unsatisfactory, and there is little hope of immediate and permanent improvement. There are still frontier tribes e.g., the Ogaden over whom Ethiopian control is only intermittent and uncertain; their country is a sort of Alsatia and a continual source of embarrassment to neighbouring Adminis-trations. Cattle and stock raids must be expected to continue, with their toll of lives and wealth; there will be the usual difficulties of obtaining redress and punishment of the guilty, involving prolonged delay and references to Addis Ababa; recalcitrant local Governors will neglect or disobey the Central Governments instructions; criminals will continue to find refuge in Ethiopian territory  and there is always the risk that conditions in the Ethiopian frontier districts will lapse into a state of complete confusion, as they did in the years immediately after the war, involving special and perhaps costly measures of protection for British tribes in neighbouring territories. Despite the special difficulties referred to above, conditions on the frontiers between Italian and British territory in Africa present a favourable contrast to those on the Ethiopia frontiers. This is particularly true of the Sudan-Eritrea frontier; and the Sudan is a territory which experiences exceptional difficulties, owing to lack of effective Ethiopian administration in the districts adjoining the Sudan boundary. Thus from the general standpoint of improved frontier administration provided that satisfactory arrangements can be made as regards trans-frontier grazing by British tribes in Somaliland effective Italian occupa-tion of Ethiopia is to be welcomed; and the relief which it would bring would more than compensate for any loss which British prestige would suffer (e.g., among the Somalis) because of the enhanced standing of the Italians after their Ethiopian conquests.51. Many of the difficulties which are constantly experienced on the Ethiopian frontiers arise from the fact that the boundaries as settled by treaty take no account, in many instances, of ethnographical and economic considera-tions. Tribes are divided by the boundary or are shut off from their habitual grazing grounds, with the result that if an &quot;open frontier&quot; policy is followed there is constant risk of friction during the seasonal migrations from one territory to another, while if a &quot;closed frontier &quot; is insisted on, tribes who are precluded from crossing to their habitual grazing grounds may suffer severely and, in any event, harbour feelings of justifiable resentment at what they feel to be inexpli-cable harshness. It so happens that the boundaries of all three territories under British control bordering on Ethiopia British Somaliland, Kenya, and the Sudan are unsatisfactory in this respect, and are indeed definitely disadvan-tageous both from the point of view of the interests of tribes under our protection and of the requirements of administration. It had been hoped that some improve-ment in the position would result from boundary concessions which the Ethiopian Government might be prepared to make in return for the cession of Zeila (see para-graph 21 above); but negotiations as to this are in suspense owing to the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, and it is most unlikely that they will be renewed. The question arises, however, whether, in the event of an Italian conquest of Ethiopia, His Majesty&apos;s Government should not press for boundary adjustments in order
to give the territories under British control boundaries at once more convenient for the purposes of administration and more just to British tribes. It seems clearly desirable that the opportunity of effecting such adjustments should not be missed; the areas affected are not extensive or valuable in themselves; and it is possible, therefore, that there would be no difficulty in coming to an agreement in regard to them. If such adjustments could be made the general position on the frontiers which at present involves a disproportionate expenditure of time, energy and money Lwould be greatly eased, especially as they would probably be accompanied by a stricter control over frontier tribes remaining in Ethiopia.52. It will be appreciated that it is not possible in this report to define the exact limits of the areas in respect of which adjustments are desirable. They can, however, be indicated briefly as follows :  (a) British Somaliland.It would be in the highest degree desirable to add to British Somaliland an area covering the habitual grazing grounds of British tribes to the south of the British Somaliland-Ethiopia boundary. (This was the main area which it was hoped to obtain from Ethiopia in exchange for the cession of Zeila.) In view of the fact, however, that it is part of this area which is at present in dispute between Italy and Ethiopia, and that the Italians are, therefore, very unlikely to agree to relinquish control of it, it is very doubtful whether His Majesty&apos;s Government could ever hope to obtain a cession of this area, especially as the Italians claim (on most inadequate evidence) that the grazing grounds round Walwal are also the habitual grazing grounds of Italian tribes. It might be that if the Italians secured possession of all Ethiopia they would be willing to give up this particular area; but probably the most that could be hoped for would be the acquisition of the area to the south of British Somaliland included in the British &quot; sphere of influence &quot; as allotted in the Anglo-Italian Protocol of 1894 (vide paragraph 20 above). This area contains no good water or grazing; but Sir A. Lawrance (the Governor of Somaliland) wrote in April 1933 (when the question of an exchange of territory with Ethiopia was being considered) : &quot;I would explain that even if the Ethiopians agreed to the substitution for the present Anglo-Ethiopian boundary of a line corresponding to the old line of demarcation between British and Italian interests, our Somali tribes will say that they have merely got some of their own back, but I am convinced that this line would be of real and lasting benefit to them and to this Administration from every point of view.&quot;Having regard to the great difficulties with which British Somali tribes have been faced in recent years, owing to the policy of the Italians in excluding them from their traditional grazing grounds, His Majesty&apos;s Government should at least press for the addition of territory up to the 1894 line to British Somaliland.(b) Kenya.53. The frontier between what is now Kenya and Ethiopia was agreed to: in general terms by the Emperor Menelik in 1897,&quot;and a formal treaty concerning it was signed in 1907: Under this treaty the boundary adopted was that which had been roughly surveyed by a Boundary Commission appointed in 1902 under Captain Maud, R.E., although no exact joint delimitation was carried out at that time. The 1907 treaty contained a clause providing that such exact delimitation should take place, and that the commissioners should also &quot; settle the frontier of the Borana with the Gurre, in concert, with the heads of those tribes and in accordance with their customs. When administration of the Kenya frontier areas was begun, it was found that the boundary line as drawn by Captain Maud was most unsuitable in several respects. Its topographical result was that the low southern plain of the Golbo became British territory, and the Borana highlands became Ethiopian territory a steep high indented escarpment being the natural feature which divides these two types of country. It was found, however, that the adoption of Captain Maud&apos;s line (which runs tangentially along the southern slopes of the escarpment), meant that almost all the permanent water supplies (on which the people in the plains depend at certain times of the year), were excluded from British territory. This made effective  administration very difficult;  and  accordingly  in  1908  the
Ethiopia Government was pressed to agree to the appointment of a commission to proceed to the exact delimitation of the frontier, with a view to the rectification-tion of the frontier in the essential interests of British tribes. Actually, how-ever, only the British Commissioner (Major Gwynne, R.E.), ever proceeded to the frontier. His examination of the frontier confirmed the fact that the Maud line was inconvenient and impracticable : thus he discovered that in certain areas there was no permanent water on the British side of the Maud line for a distance of 100 miles, all the permanent water serving that area being immediately to the north of the line. Major Gwynne accordingly surveyed another boundary line (known as the Gwynne line) with the object of securing a frontier more practicable for administrative purposes than that of Captain Maud; but it has never been possible to secure the concurrence of the Ethiopia Government in the appointment of a commission to rectify the boundary in this area, with the result that the completely unsatisfactory line of Captain Maud has remained as the undemarcated frontier, to the great inconvenience of the British Administration and British tribes.: 54. It is therefore most desirable that no opportunity should be lost of obtaining a rectification of the present Kenya-Ethiopia frontier by securing an accession of territory between longitude 38-5&quot; and longitude 40c, especially areas with water supplies, i.e., up to a revised and &quot;natural&quot; frontier roughly approximating to the line indicated by Major Gwynne. Such a rectification would give British tribes the water supplies in the tangential valleys, at present in Ethiopia, which are the supplies for the grazing grounds lying to the south and would give a frontier which would make effective administration on either side more practicable than it can ever be with the existing frontier. There is no need in this report to specify in detail the most satisfactory line for the revised boundary to follow; roughly what is required is an accession of territory north of Moyale between longitudes 40o and 35c as far as Leh and G&apos;of.(c) The Sudan.55. The frontier between the Sudan and Ethiopia is marked by a disregard of economic and ethnological features similar to that of the Kenya-Ethiopia boundary. There are the same cases of tribes who have no affinities with the Ethiopians proper and who are subject to no effective administration by the Ethiopian authorities. Consequently, the disordered state of the Ethiopian frontier areas is a constant source of embarrassment to the Sudan Government: traffickers in arms, criminals evading arrest and whole sections of tribes avoiding taxation find a ready refuge in these districts. It was hoped that if Zeila were conceded to Ethiopia, the almost intolerable position on the Sudan-Ethiopia frontier might be eased by the concession to the Sudan of certain of these areas, which, as explained above, are subject to no regular Ethiopian administration. And although the districts in question are in the west of Ethiopia and are therefore part of the area in respect of which His Majesty&apos;s Government agreed in 1925 that Italy should have an exclusive economic influence, every endeavour should be made to assist the Government of the Sudan by securing, if possible, adjustments of the Sudan frontier should Italy assume control over Ethiopia. It is again impossible in this report to give any precise definition of the best frontier line without a detailed survey of the country, including a survey of tribal limits; but the general desiderata of the Sudan Government may be summarised briefly as follows : (i) Complete control of the continuer tribe and of the Western Anuak by the acquisition of the greater part of the Baro salient. This is an area in which Ethiopian administration is only intermittent and consists of occasional punitive expeditions. The tribes are all Nilotic, who have close relations with tribes living in the Sudan. The territory occupied by both the continuer and the Anuak tribes is actually divided by the present frontier; their dry weather grazing grounds are in Ethiopian territory, and attempts have been made by the Ethiopian authorities to claim that they are subject to Ethiopian administration. The general position of uncertainty in this area and the disordered state of the Ethiopian territory across the frontier makes disaffection among the continuer tribe (who are powerful, warlike and well-armed) a constant source of anxiety to the Sudan Government. The danger of a really serious revolt can only be safely averted by a realignment of the frontier to include in the Sudan their dry-weather [12021] e
grazing grounds. Incidentally, the acquisition of the larger part of the, Baro salient would give Gambeila to the Sudan. This is the enclave in Ethiopian territory which, under article 4 of the Anglo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1902, is leased to the Sudan to be administered and occupied as a commercial station. It would be of advantage to the Sudan to secure full control over Gambeila, especially as there have been disputes with the Ethiopian Government in regard to the status and control of the enclave.(ii) The second desideratum of the Sudan Government is the area generally known as Beni Shangul, i.e., an area bounded in the north-east and south by the Blue Nile and Dabus Rivers. Historically, the whole area lying west of the Dabus is connected with the Sudan rather than with Ethiopia; ethnologically, the area has no connexion whatever with Ethiopia, and it is subject to very little control by the central Ethiopian Government. Although there have been in this sector no large-scale raids comparable to those that have taken place in the Baro salient, there have been several cases of abductions by tribes inhabiting the area of persons claimed by them as slaves, while, in addition, it has proved impossible to obtain the return to the Sudan of offenders who have taken refuge over the border in this area.It is probable that some further adjustment could with advantage be made on this frontier-including, in all probability, the cession by the Sudan of certain areas (i.e., the southern area of the Ilembe triangle, which is not inhabited by any Sudan tribes and for the inhabitants of which no responsibility has been assumed by the Sudan Government) but the two adjustments mentioned above are the most important. It may be pointed out that even if Italy were to establish effective administration in the frontier districts, the fact that the existing boundary divides tribes, or shuts tribes off from their grazing grounds, would mean that there would be constant friction and unrest on the frontier unless the boundary were altered. Thus it would be to Italy&apos;s ultimate advantage to agree to such adjustments.56. This part of the report can be summarised by saying that it is considered that should Italy obtain control over Ethiopia, His Majesty&apos;s Government should not neglect any opportunity which should offer of securing frontier adjustments on the general lines indicated above. Admittedly such adjustments provide (on balance) for accessions of territory by dependencies under British control; but the object of making such adjustments would be not to obtain more territory for the sake of adding to British possessions, but to make the frontier lines conform more closely to the natural physical and ethnological divisions of the country. Further, the areas affected are remote from Addis Ababa and the Ethiopian highlands proper; so far as is known, they are of little intrinsic or potential value, and prima facie, therefore, it should not be difficult to obtain the concurrence of the Italian Government to their concession. Before any detailed negotiations were begun with the Italians it would, of course, be necessary to consult the local administrations concerned with a view to the exact definition of the areas in respect of which adjustment would be desirable; this report aims only at indicating in general terms what are the main areas in regard to which it is known that the local Governments are anxious for frontier rectifications in order to make the work of administration and the task of maintaining law and order on the frontiers less onerous and expensive than they are at present.Summary.We can summarise our main conclusions as follows  (1) Italy will undoubtedly endeavour during the next few years to secure control over Ethiopia, although her immediate action may be confined to obtaining an accession of low-lying territory on the borders of Italian Somaliland.(2) No such vital British interest is concerned in and round Ethiopia as would make it essential for His Majesty&apos;s Government to resist an Italian conquest of Ethiopia. While effective Italian control of Ethiopia would be of advantage in some ways (e.g., as giving security on the frontiers), it would operate to our disadvantage in others (e.g., in trade). Generally speaking, however, so far as local British interests are concerned, there is no balance of advantage in either direction, i.e., if Ethiopia remains independent or if it is absorbed by Italy.
(3) From the standpoint of Imperial defence, an independent Ethiopia would be preferable to an Italian Ethiopia, but the threat to British interests is a remote one, and depends on the unlikely event of a war with Italy.(4) The most vital British interest in Ethiopia remains Lake Tsana and the Nile Basin. This is also a vital interest of Egypt, which His Majesty&apos;s Government are bound to protect. In the event of the disappearance of Ethiopia as an independent State, His Majesty&apos;s Government should aim at securing territorial control over Lake Tsana and a suitable corridor linking it to the Sudan.(5) Similarly, in the event of the establishment of Italian control over Ethiopia, His Majesty&apos;s Government should take steps to secure the safeguarding of British interests in the other tributaries of the Nile flowing in Ethiopia, e.g., the Sobat, by obtaining a definite undertaking that no works will be constructed on those rivers interrupting or diminishing their flow without prior concurrence of His Majesty&apos;s Government and of the Egyptian Government;(6) Should it not be possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to secure territorial control over Lake Tsana and the adjacent areas as suggested in (4) above, they should take all possible steps to safeguard British and Egyptian interests in regard to Lake Tsana, and should use the opportunity to secure less onerous terms for the construction of a barrage on the lake.(7) It is essential that every endeavour be made to secure for protected British tribes in Somaliland the right to the unimpeded use of their habitual grazing grounds across the frontier in what is now Ethiopian territory either by securing an accession of territory or by obtaining from the Italians recognition of the right to use the grazing grounds in what will become Italian territory.(8) Although British and Indian trade interests in Ethiopia are negligible, and although there are no large-scale British enterprises established in Ethiopia, every endeavour should be made, in the event of an Italian absorption of Ethiopia, to secure that British subjects have, as now, equal opportunities for trading in Ethiopian territory, efforts should be made to maintain the &quot; open door &quot; in Ethiopia. Steps should also be taken, if practicable, to safeguard the direct and transit trade between Ethiopia, British Somaliland and the Sudan a trade of some importance in the economy of the two latter territories.(9) Opportunity should be taken, if possible, to obtain frontier adjustments on the frontiers of British Somaliland, Kenya and the Sudan, in order to incorporate in these territories areas linked to them economically and ethnographically.J.

Annex.Foreign Office to Colonial Office.(Very Confidential.)Sir, , Foreign Office, March 6, 1935.THE Secretary of State for the Colonies will certainly be aware that, as the result of conversations which have lately taken place between Trance and Italy, a comprehensive agreement has been reached between those two countries covering their colonial interests in Africa, and disposing of the mutual differences that have endured in regard thereto since the end of the European War. This agreement was concluded following the visit paid by the present French Prime Minister to Rome at the beginning of the year, and Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister will also be aware that, in addition to discussing purely colonial questions with Signor Mussolini, M. Laval also dealt with questions of mutual interest connected with Ethiopia. It was only on the 29th January, however, that the counsellor to the Italian Embassy in London called at this Department, on instructions from the Italian Government, to inform His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment of the nature of the understanding which had secretly been reached in Rome between M. Laval and Signor Mussolini, in respect of the maintenance and development of French and Italian interests in Abyssinia.2. M. Vitetti explained that the understanding in question had taken the form of an exchange of personal letters between the two statesmen. In the first of these M. Laval had addressed Signor Mussolini, recording that they had lately enquired into the position of France and Italy in East Africa, with special reference to the interests of French Somaliland on the one hand, and of Eritrea and Italian Somaliland on the other. As the result, it had been mutually agreed that each would give effect to the policy of friendly co-operation which the French and Italian Governments were following with regard to territories adjacent to their African possessions. M. Laval had then gone on to state that, in so far as the French interests recognised by the Tripartite Treaty of 1906, together with the interests mentioned in the various international agreements specified in article 1 of that treaty, were concerned, the French Government would not pursue in Ethiopia the development of any interest other than the economic interests connected with the traffic of the Jibuti-Addis Ababa Railway in a specified zone, covering territory on both sides of the railway. This zone, a map of which is enclosed,^) starts from the Franco-Ethiopian boundary at Lake Gum, attaining the River Hawash at Gubo. From this point the boundary of the Zone follows that river as far as the 10th parallel, along which it continues in a westerly direction until it reaches the first degree of longitude west of Addis Ababa; turning south at that point, the boundary follows that degree of longitude southwards until it reaches the 8th parallel; continuing along the latter eastwards as far as its intersection with the first degree of longitude east of Harrar; then proceeding north along that degree of longitude until its intersection with the caravan route leading towards the border between British and French Somaliland, the said caravan route apparently forming the north-easterly limits of the zone. It is in this so-called railway zone that the French Government reserve complete freedom of action with regard to the maintenance or development of economic rights or concessions. In the remainder of Ethiopia, while not renouncing any rights already enjoyed by French citizens or protected persons under the Franco-Ethiopian Treaty of the 10th January, 1908, nor any other concessions or rights that may already exist in other parts of Ethiopian territory outside the railway zone, and while maintaining the right to renew any of the above-mentioned concessions that may expire, France would seek no new rights.3. The Italian counsellor explained that, in his reply to M. Laval, Signor Mussolini took note of the French declarations and gave assurances that Italy would respect the French economic interests specified therein.4. M. Vitetti then went on to say that he had been instructed, in notifying His Majesty&apos;s Government of the foregoing, first to emphasise that Italy&apos;s(&apos;) See map at end.
intentions towards Ethiopia were pacific, and secondly to intimate that the Italian Government would like to exchange views with His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment on the respective interests of both Governments in Ethiopia, and to explore the possibility of the development of such interests in a mutually harmonious manner.5. These were M. Vitetti&apos;s own words, and they appear on the face of it to amount to an invitation to His Majesty&apos;s Government to agree with the Italian Government on the delimitation between the two Powers of spheres of influence in those parts of Ethiopia as regards which France has apparently disinterested herself. In reply, no attempt was made there and then to elicit their meaning more precisely from M. Vitetti with, for example, special reference to the Anglo-Italian exchange of notes of 1925. The reason thereof was the fact that the Italian demarche had already been made in general terms by the Italian Ambassador in conversations with the Secretary of State and Sir Robert Vansittart on the 29th and 30th January, M. Grandi being then informed that, until the questions raised had been carefully examined, it would not be possible to express any views. Any detailed enquiries might thus have encouraged the Italian counsellor to commit his Government more explicitly to proposals which His Majesty&apos;s Government may in the long run feel obliged to resist. It seems advisable, therefore, for His Majesty&apos;s Government to decide on the nature of British interests and to keep the initiative as much as possible in their own hands, so that they may from the beginning be in a position to guide Italian requests away from points which His Majesty&apos;s Government will be unable to concede. The representation made by the Italian Ambassador can hardly be dissociated from the dispute which is still going on between Italy and Ethiopia over the ownership of certain territory on the undefined border of Italian Somaliland and Ethiopia, and of the consequential military preparations undertaken by the Italian Government. With these Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister is already generally familiar. This dispute and these preparations, taken in conjunction with the known ambitions of the Italian Government to find some scope for expansion outside Europe, point strongly to the possibility that that at which the Italian Government aim is not a mere economic predominance in Ethiopia only, but the virtual absorption of as much Ethiopian territory as can be achieved without jeopardy to their interests and influence in other parts of the world. At any rate, it is on this assumption that a reply to M. Grandi&apos;s enquiries should, in Sir John Simon&apos;s opinion, be discussed.6. To this discussion consideration of three different sets of circumstances must be brought. It will be desirable, firstly, to estimate, so far as possible, the value to a civilised Power of a predominant political influence in Ethiopia, of a reversionary interest in the sovereignty of the country, and of a free hand to exploit its economic resources; secondly, to forecast how the gradual or violent absorption of a part or the whole of Ethiopia by Italy would (a) react upon the existing treaty rights and obligations of this country with respect to Ethiopia and the two foreign limitrophe Powers, and (b) affect the interests of His Majesty&apos;s Government as guarantors of Egypt vis-a-vis of foreign countries, as co-sovereigns of the Sudan, as the sovereign Power in Kenya, as the mandatory Power in Tanganyika, and as the protecting Power in British Somaliland and Uganda; thirdly, to calculate what the effect would be on the general political relations between His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Italian Government, and on the military position of both, of acquiescence on the one hand in Italian colonial ambitions, or, alternatively, resistance to a policy of expansion, for which, perhaps, no other field can readily be found. In Sir John Simon&apos;s opinion, such questions can most usefully be considered, in the first instance, by an inter-departmental committee, on which the Colonial Office, the Foreign Office and the Service Departments should be represented. If Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister agrees in this view, he will, perhaps decide to avail himself of Sir John Maffey&apos;s great experience of the Sudan and administrative responsibilities in the countries bordering on Ethiopia by inviting him to act as chairman. Subject to Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister&apos;s observations, the present letter might suffice as the committee&apos;s terms of reference. It would be open to the chairman to invite the attendance of any persons qualified to advise His Majesty&apos;s Government on their Ethiopian policy, but while the subject is obviously one of magnitude and complexity, it would be desirable that the committee should report without any avoidable delay.
7. Copies of letters addressed to the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry,(2) together with-a copy of a despatch sent to His Majesty5s Ambassador at Paris, (2) are enclosed for the information of Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, and copies of this letter are being sent to the India Office, Dominions Office, Board of Trade and Department of Overseas Trade.I am, &amp;c.RONALD CAMPBELL.(8) Not printed.APPENDIX.[J 3572/G]Note by Mr. Macgregor.THE question has been put to me whether and to what extent the waters of Lake Tsana and the Blue Nile could be tampered with to the detriment of Egypt and/or the Sudan, and this note attempts an answer at short notice. I must make the reservation that I have not visited the lake, and my knowledge of the surround-ing country is therefore second-hand. It must also be remembered that the country has never been completely surveyed. With these reservations, the following points are put forward :  I. Permanent Injury by Diversion.(1) The water of Lake Tsana cannot be diverted out of the Nile Basin.(2) It is perhaps possible that the flow could be diverted from the Blue Nile into the Atbara, but the magnitude of such an undertaking cannot be gauged owing to lack of engineering data. The effect would be injurious to the Sudan, but not necessarily to Egypt.(3) The flow could certainly be diverted from its present course so as to fall into the head waters of the Dinder or Rahad. The works that would be needed to achieve this are believed to be on a moderate scale. The water would rejoin the Blue Nile, but below the Sennar Dam. It would be no very serious matter to neutralise this by diverting the Dinder so as to fall in above the dam, but it would probably be impossible so to divert the Rahad. No engineering data are available to permit of a more exact appreciation of these possibilities.The injury would fall on the Sudan rather than on Egypt.II. Permanent Injury by Economic Development.(1) A very definite possibility is hydro-electric development, to which this lake, situated on a high plateau and at the edge of a steep escarpment, very obviously lends itself. The Italians have a. natural bent for water-power, and this is a very favourable site. The power would be used for railway and general purposes, and for the production of nitrogen fertilisers. The Swiss engineer employed by the Ethiopian Government after Ras TafarPs conversations with Mr. Ramsay MacDonald in 1924, is understood to have recommended that the lake be developed in this manner.(2) It is not known whether this engineer made detailed recommendations. It is believed, however, that by far the most effective development would be through diversion (3) above. At a reasonable cost a fall of 2,500 or 3,000 feet could be obtained, and it is almost certain that the scheme would be on these lines. Lack of topographical data makes it uncertain whether the tail water would be discharged into the Dinder or the Rahad.  It would be one or other.(3) Apart from the cost of bringing the water back into the Blue Nile, already mentioned, the Sudan and Egypt would suffer a loss of utilizable flow. If developed for irrigation purposes the annual run-off from the lake would be concentrated into six months of the year. On the other hand if used for power the object would be to equalise the flow all the year round.   Thus for half the
year water would be passing through, to the sea, and wasted from the irrigation point of view. In other words, the value of Lake Tsana as a storage reservoir would be halved.III.- Injury by Temporary Manipulation.Any one of the permanent diversions, referred to under I above, would be a costly undertaking and would take some years to execute, As an act of hostility it would be more effective to block the outfall temporarily. This could be done without much difficulty at any time from about the end of January to the end of July. In May or June the flow at the outfall is so diminished that no special plant or organisation would be needed, and a field company of sappers could probably close the channel in a week or ten days. The bank so constructed would hold up the water entirely for a year or more, and it would then be possible to cut the bank and discharge the contents during the flood season. Thus the annual flow of the lake would be passed with the surplus flood water into the sea and so entirely wasted. During the year of complete stoppage a simple structure could be erected which would make it possible to repeat the process every year. In fact the proper working of a storage reservoir would be reversed; water would be stored at the season of shortage, and released at the season of surplus.IV&apos;. Injury by Abstraction.If there is any irrigable land its extent is not such as to constitute a serious threat to riparian interests below.V -Nuisance Value.Whatever the probability that any of the foregoing acts might be attempted, their mere possibility must give to Lake Tsana in foreign hands a high nuisance value. The reaction of public opinion in Egypt is likely to be out of all proportion to the real magnitude of the potential injury. The Sudan Government and particularly the Irrigation Department would be seriously embarrassed in their future relations with Egypt on irrigation questions, since Egypt would be more jealous than ever of her water supplies, if these are subject to hostile manipula-tion as well as to the vagaries of rainfall.It is perhaps reasonable to forecast that the nuisance value would prove to be more serious than the intrinsic danger.R. M. MACGREGOR.August 9, 1935.
