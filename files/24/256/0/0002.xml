COPY NO. UP.   -CABINET. THE SPEAKER&apos;S SEAT. REPORT OF CABINET COMMITTEE.1.     The Committee5 who were given power to co-opt the attorney-General if they so desired., were apointed on the26th June,  1935 (Cabinet 34 (35) Conclusion 8), to consider thequestion of the legislation that would be required in order toensure that the Speaker of the House of Commons should not be opposed at elections.      The Committee were invited by theCabinet to discuss the matter with certain Members of Parlia-ment, e.g0s-Sir Austen Chamberlain and Mr. Lloyd George, as representatives of the older Members of the House of Commons^Earl Wintertonj as one of the older Private Membersi  .Mr. Lansbury and Sir Herbert Samuel, as representatives of the Oppositions!Sir Hugh 0&apos;Neill, as representative of Northern Ireland.2. The Committee have held three meetings, at the first of which the decision was taken to co-opt the Attorney-General, in accordance with the Cabinet authority referred to above.The Committee have discussed the problem referred to them with the Members of Parliament mentioned in paragraph 1.3*      The Committee have thought it right to give a wide interpretation to their terms of reference.      It will be found from the examination which follows, and from the recommendationsSECRET. CP.  142  (55) .(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).
which conclude the present Report, that the Committee have formed the clear opinion that legislation such as is suggested in their terms of reference would not furnish a solution of the present difficulty.      Their inquiries,  indeed,  appear to them to have revealed a strong case against any constitutional innovation in connection with the Speakership.4.      The question is whether continuity in the occupation of the Speaker&apos;s Chair might be maintained,  and he &quot;be saved from being dragged into Party politics, as might happen if he had to fight an ordinary Parliamentary Election, by removing him in some way from the risk of being opposed in his constituency at a General Election.      The inquiries which we have made show that in substance only one proposed solution has resulted from the controversy, namely, that legislation should be passed providing that the Speaker of the old House of Commons should by one method or another be excepted from the dissolution of Parliament, in order to make it certain that he will be eligible for re-election as Speaker of the new House of Commons,,      A method of achieving this object which has been advocated in some quarters is that the Speaker,  on being elected to the Chair, should cease to be Member for the constituency which returned him to the House,  so that a by-election would occur in that constituency to fill the vacancy, while the Speaker would,  in virtue of his office, be chosen as &quot;Member for the palace of Westminster&quot;, or something of the kind, and would be the only person capable of holding this latter seat as long as he was Speaker.5.      The desirability of such legislation may first be considered on practical grounds.      It will be agreed that a measure amounting to a very considerable constitutional innovation ought not to be introduced unless it is assured of something approaching general approval in the House.Our consultations with Members of Parliament show that general assent for the suggested constitutional change
is not forthcoming.Mr. Lansbury&apos;s attitude was in favour of a change of the nature above suggested, and opposed to the findings of the Committee.      Such was- the decision of the Labour Party.Sir Herbert Samuel has expressed himself as definitely opposed to the suggestion.Mr, Lloyd George has informed us that he is against any alteration of the Parliamentary system.      He thinks that if the Leaders of the National Government and the Leaders or prominent members of other parties were to issue an appeal to the electors of the Speaker&apos;s constituency in which they laid stress on the Speaker&apos;s success in his appointment, on his acknowledged impartiality and on the difficulties under which he labours so long as he is Speaker in taking part in a contested election, there will be no doubt as to his retaining his seat. Mr. Lloyd George has said that he himself would be willing to take part in any such appeal and to do whatever else he can to help.66      Sir Hugh 0&apos;Neill has informed us that he does not consider the objections to such a measure to be insuperable5    at the same time, however, he recognises that there are difficulties and that the change could only be made with consent of the House as a whole.Sir Austen Chamberlain and Lord Winterton are emphatically opposed to the plan.      The former has written as follows s-S,I should view with profound regret the creation of a special seat for the Speaker - indeed regret is too mild a word for my feelings.
The Speaker is one of us - primus inter pares, &quot;but essentially one member out of 500 elected just like the others and chosen by them to be their presiding officer and spokesman from their own ranks.The Lord Chancellor need not be a member of the House of Lords and presides even though not a member, but his authority within that House is not comparable to that of the Speaker in ours.      The ready acceptance of the Speaker&apos;s authority depends upon the fact that he is one of us - distinguished from the rest only by our free choice.      I fear that the proposal would destroy his authority.If help is needed,  I for one should feel it a duty to him and to the House to speak in his constituency7.      Our inquiries thus disclose the fact that there is no prospect of unanimity in the House of Commons in support of the suggested Bill.      In our view this forms an almost decisive consideration.      It would be politically impracticable to take action in so delicate a matter as the status of&quot; the Speakership in the face of an influential body of opposition.8.      In addition, our investigation shows that an extremely strong case exists against the proposal,  on purely constitutional grounds.The following paragraphs set out the existing constitutional position regarding the Speakership, so far as it is relevant to the question under consideration,  and draw attention to the consequences which would be involved if the proposed legislative change were adopted.9.      After every General Election the first duty of the Members of the House of Commons is to elect their Speaker. On the day appointed for the first meeting of the new Parliament, Black Rod summons the newly elected Members
to the House of Peers, and the Lord. Chancellor,  in obedience to directions given to him by Letters Patent., acquaints those returned as Members of the lower House &quot;that His Majesty will, as soon as the Members of both Houses shall be sworn, declare the causes of .his calling this Parliament;    and it being necessary that a Speaker of the Houseof Commons shall be first chosen, that you, gentlemen of-the House of Commons, repair- to the place where you are to sit, and there proceed to the appointment of some proper person to be your speaker;    and that you present such person whom you shall so choose, here, tomorrow, at an hour stated, for His Majesty&apos;s royal approbation&quot;.10o       It is  to be noted therefore that the election of the Speaker takes place before any Members are sworn.      It is true that the form of words used by the Lord Chancellor does not expressly require the Members of the Commons to choose one of their own number as Speaker, but this is really implied in the nature of the office  (the Speaker or &quot;Prolocutor!l is so called because he is chosen by his colleagues to speak for the Commons to the Crown), and it would be on many grounds an impossible breach of constitutional practice., if not of constitutional law, to imagine that the House of Commons would elect anyone other than one of their own number to be Speaker.      Thus there is
no special oath for the Speaker, vrtiose vow of allegiance is contained in the oath he makes as a Member of the House of Commons.      Moreover,  the procedure followed when the Speaker is elected requires that the candidate should be then present in the House, which he can only be because he has been elected a Member of that Parliament.      The procedure when Mr.   Speaker elect presents himself in the House of Peers for the royal approbation equally implies that he is one of the Members of the newly elected House of Commons chosen by the others to be their Speaker, and indeed it was formerly the case for the Speaker elect when he presented himself for confirmation to say that&quot;If it should be His Majesty&apos;s pleasure to disapprove of this choice, His Majesty&apos;s faithful Commons will at once select some other Member of their House, better qualified to fill the station than himself11.11.       When the Speaker&apos;s nomination has been duly confirmed through the mouth of the Lord Chancellor, he returns to the Commons and reminds the Members that they must all now take the oath and is himself the first Member to do so.12o        It is therefore manifest, both from the procedure followed and still more from the fundamental constitutional principles involved, that the Speaker elected at the beginning of a new Parliament must himself be an individual who has been elected to be a Member of that Parliament.
It is true that, -f-or ^certain-limited. pur.pos.es, the Speaker  does not cease to he Speaker at the moment when parliament is dissolved,:        But he ceases to he a Member of parliament at dissolution and does1 not become,a Member, of parliament again unless he is re-elected by a constituency.      The purposes for which the Speaker remains Speaker after dissolution are set out in the House of Commons (Speaker) Act, 1832,  (2 &amp; 3 Will. IV.  c.105) and the House of Commons Offices Act,  1846,  (9 &amp; 10 Vic.  c.77).      The former Act secures that in the event of dissolution the Speaker will continue to draw his salary until a new Speaker is chosen.      The latter Act provides that the Speaker will continue to act as one of the Commissioners under the House of Commons Offices Act,  1812 (52 Geo.HI. ell) until a new Speaker is chosen.      This is to secure that the salaries of officers of the House and certain administrative matters connected with the House shall continue uninterrupted by the.dissolution.      But each of these Acts of Parliament only continue the position of the Speaker as Speaker &quot;for the purposes of this Act&quot;.      The Speaker does not continue Speaker for any other purpose, e.g., when the new House meets the former Speaker does not preside until the new Speaker is chosen.     And nothing in any existing statute gives the least support to the view that the Speaker elected by one Parliament has for this reason any position in the next.
9 9 0 613.       The Speaker- in the 18th and early 19th century often continued to act as a party politician.      Mr,  Speaker liarley9 while occupying the Speaker&apos;s Chair, became Secretary of State and Leader of the Tory Party;    Mr.  Speaker Abbot used the opportunity of delivering a Money Bill at the bar of the House of Lords to make a political speech in opposition to Catholic claims;    Mr. Speaker Manners Sutton was not re-elected in 1835 because he had associated with his party in the earlier Parliament when not actually in the Speaker&apos;s Chair.      Down to that time Speakers often intervened in Committee debates and Mr.  Speaker Shaw Lefevre was the first to abstain from this practice and to establish a Speaker&apos;s absolute abstention from the exercise of the rights of an ordinary Member in matters of controversy. But the Speaker is essentially a Member of the House of Commons none the less9 and if on a division the votes are equal the Speaker has to give a casting vote,, (as Speaker Abbot did in connection with the impeachment of Melville)014.       Of coursej though the modern Speaker does not take part in debate or exercise any party influence9 he is perfectly at liberty to act as the representative of his constituency in dealing with Government Departments.15,       It seems to follow from the above considerations that if Mr.  Speaker is to be rendered immune from opposition in his own constituency at an impending General Election^ this could only be accomplished by providing that the Speaker of the House of Commons at  the dissolution of one Parliament  shall ipso facto be regarded as a Member of the next.      Consequently when writs are issued for the election of Members to be returned to a new Parliament9 those who will assemble as. having been elected to serve in that
Parliament will have added to their number another person who has not been elected at all.      Whatever be the formalities by which this result is brought about (by calling the Speaker &quot;Member for the Palace of Westminster&quot; or otherwise) this is the substance of the matter,  and it should be observed that the ex-Speaker would find himself included in the list of new Members not because he is Speaker or because he is going to be Speaker but because in a previous Parliament he was Speaker.      Consequently when a new Parliament is required to elect its Speaker from among its Members9  the ex-Speaker will be in the situation of being a person who is unlike all other possible candidates for the post in that he has not been elected to that Parliament at all, and if there was a contest for the Speakership between him and an ordinary Member9 this contest would be conducted on the undesirable basis that if the ex-Speaker is not elected he must leave the new House of Commons.      If a case was to arise in which the independent judgment of the new House of Commons thought it desirable for any reason to choose a different Speaker, the position might be exceedingly invidious.16.       The above considerations  seem to show that theproposal involves a much more serious constitutional anomalythan might at first sight be supposed.    It has to heremembered that the British Parliament is regarded as the model for parliamentary institutions all over the world,, andin no particular does the British Parliament receive a moreuniversal admiration than in the position which we havegiven to our Speaker.      (There is a passage in BryceTs- pages 140 to 143-Cohstitution of the United States^/about the Speaker of theHouse of Representatives which affords a striking contrast).
The essence of the constitutional position is that the Speaker is an ordinary Member of the House of Commons, put into the Chair by his fellows because of their regard for his worth and impartiality.     Would not a change in our practice be likely to lead to changes in the practice of those who still endeavour to imitate our methods in the Dominions and elsewhere?      Not only is it a fundamental principle of our constitution that the Speaker should be elected a Member of the very House of Commons over which he presides, but it is equally important to preserve the conception that he is in nature in exactly the same position as any other Member of Parliament.      To give him a special right to sit in a parliament to which he has not been elected with the intention, but not with the certainty, that the continuity of the Speaker5s office will be preserved, involves not only a departure from Parliamentary usage, but a marked change in the relation of the Speakership to the elected House.17.    A strong case has been shown to exist, on both practical and constitutional grounds, against the suggested alteration in the status of the Speakership.18.    It remains to be considered what steps can betaken in view of the intention of the Labour organisation inDaventry to oppose the Speaker at the General Election.It would be possible to provide Mr. Speaker with a safe seat.      This would have to be done before the General Election. It has been shown in paragraphs 9 and 10 of the present Report that a Speaker must be elected before a new House of Commons can proceed to any other business, such as the issue of a writ for a bv-election^    it is therefore not a practical solution that a Member of the new House should stand aside for Mr.  Speaker after the General Election.In any event, this is not a course which we recommend.      It would be an admission of defeat,  and it would establish a precedent for contests in a Speaker&apos;s constituency.
3519.    It seems to us accordingly to be necessary that the Speaker&apos; should, again stand for his present constituency, asking it to repudiate the suggested breach with tradition and. to return him as a non-party man.,     We anticipate that this would prove a successful gesture, and. we consider that it might have the salutary result of establishing the inexpediency of similar contests in future.20.    Considerable support from outside the constituency will, however, be-desirable, in order to secure a complete presenta-tion of the constitutional case.      It appears to us that the happiest method of achieving this result would, be for all parties in the House of Commons to join in some constitutional pronouncement to the effect that the Speakership must be kept out of politics and that the Members making the pronouncement would do their utmost to secure Mr.  Speaker&apos;s return.21.    Such a united pronouncement is probably not at present obtainable,,  and the action which we recommend is that an authoritative statement of the constitutional position should be made by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons, preferably at Question Time.      It is for the Cabinet to consider whether the Prime Minister&apos;s statement should include the offer of a White Pai:er or not.      If a White Paper is thought desirable the present Report, with some necessary excisions, might serve as a basis.22.    The way would, then be clear for prominent parliamentary spokesmen of any or all Parties to conduct inside the constituency a campaign which would expose the ungenerous character of the local opposition and would secure Mr.  Speaker&apos;s return.      In this connection the offers already made by Sir Austen Chamberlain and Mr. Lloyd George should be noted.
Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations *23, The Committeefs conclusions and recommendations to the Cabinet may be summarised as followss-(i) It is of great importance.to maintain the present position of the Speakership, by which the Speaker stands aloof from Party controversy!(ii)    There are serious objections, both on practical and on constitutional grounds, which preclude us from recommending that legislation should be passed in order to ensure that the Speaker should not be opposed at Electionsj    this could only be done by legislating that the Speaker at the end of one Parliament should in virtue of that fact be treated as a member at the beginning of the next;;(iii)    We recommend that an authoritative statement of the constitutional position regarding the Speakership should be made by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons3(iv)    Every encouragement  should then be given toprominent Parliamentary spokesmen,  of any or all Parties, to conoVuct inside Mr.  Speaker&apos;s constituency a campaign which will secure his return4Signed on behalf of the CommitteeJ.
