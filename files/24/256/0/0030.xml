,0^jrffiNTIAL. A.oBOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL.. STATE OF TRADE - JULY,  1955.Summary of reports submitted by members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some cases with statistical information from other sources).OVERSEAS TRADE.    Imports in July at  61.8 rn. were  3.8 m, higher than in July, 1934, imports of raw materials increasing &quot;by  0.4 m. and of articles wholly or mainly manufactured &quot;by  1.2 m;      Exports of United Kingdom produce and manufactures were  36.4 m. or  3.2 m. more than a year ago.      The rise was largely due to increased exports of manufactured goods.    Re-exports amounted to  4.0 m.  as compared with  4.1 rn. a year earlier.EMPLOYMENT.    The total number of persons on the registers of Employment Exchanges at 22nd July was 1,972,941 a decrease of 27,169 as compared with a month earlier.The main variations werej-London.......... - 9,732South Eastern ... - 6,256Southwestern ... - 7,527Midlands  ......... 4- 4,133North Eastern ... - 20,293North Western ... - 202Scotland ........ * 18,902Wales  ........... - 6,194The estimated number of insured persons aged 16-64 in employment at 22nd July was 10,381,000.    This was 20,000 more than a month earlier and 254,000 more than a year ago.An improvement in employment was recorded in engineering^ iron and steel and motor vehicle industries,  electric cable and apparatus manufacture,  the woollen and worsted and hosiery industries, transport and distributive trades, and most of the food and drink industries and coal mining.    Employment declined
in most of the clothing trades,  in cotton spinning,  in the linen industry and in &quot;building and public works contracting, Owing to local holidays there was a sharp increase in the numbers temporarily stopped in the jute industry.RAILWAY TRAFFIC. During the four weeks ended 28th July railway traffic receipts increased by  255,000 (2.06^) as compared with the corresponding period of 1934.    There were increases of 2.2^ and 3.6^ respectively in the receipts from passenger traffic and freight train traffic, while coal, coke and patent fuel fell by lv4$&amp;.    The total receipts for the 50 weeks ended 28th July amounted to  84.3 m.  against  85.7 rn. for the same period in 1934*SHIPPING.,   The index number for shipping freights (1913 - 100) was 80*30 in July as against 75.90 in June and 79.02 twelve months ago.BANKING.     Easy conditions prevailed in the money: market throughout the month.    There has been a fairly consistent demand for short money, which the Banks have easily satisfied. In the first three weeks of the month the Treasury Bill tender rate fluctuated between 12s.ld and 12s.4d.     At the end of the month, however, it fell shax^ply to 10s.10d.  owing,, it is understood,  to fear of an inflow of foreign money.During the first half of the month foreign exchanges were fairly steady.   Later, however, the weakness of the guilder, owing to the political situation in Holland and the suspension by Italy of a 40 per cent, metallic cover for her note circulation had a depressing effect on all other Continental gold currencies.    The formation of the new Dutch Cabinet at the end of the month strengthened the guilder,  though the weakness of forward rates shows that the outlook is still considered uncertain.     With the Improvement in the guilder,
gold currencies showed a general appreciation.    In the gold market the premiums over the dollar and franc exchange parities have now heen reduced to small proportions.    In the-silver market there were heavy offerings from India and China during the first half of the month hut a sharp break in price was averted by American support.    During the latter half of the month the market was steady.IRON AND STEEL. Satisfactory conditions continued in the iron and steel markets during July and consuriiers are showing more disposition to make forward bookings.    There is some weakness, however, in the export market.    Business in pig iron has been mainly confined to small parcels, hut an appreciable increase in production is expected after the holidays.    Conditions in the semi-finished department have heen somevvhat collet, although demand has teen steady. Active conditions, however, have prevailed among producers of finished steel, although the business has been mainly on home a c count.Scotland.    Business conditions have heen generally favourable.    Locomotive builders, rolling stock makers and boiler makers have all heen well employed.    The demand for pig iron shows definite improvement and re-rollers were better employed than for some time past.    There has been some improvement in the shipbuilding position with the recent contracts placed on the Clyde.North East Coast *    Pig iron producers report satisfactory deliveries.    Steel output is heavy and makers have large orders on hand for steel billets and sheet &quot;bars, and the demand for joists and sections for structural work is exceptionally good.      Railway material has shown, a
seasonal decline.      Contracts recently placed in the Tyne, Wear and Tees shipyards will in time benefit the local producers.       Export demand showed an improvement during the month.Sheffield.    A high level of activity was maintained by most sections of the trade.      There has been an active demand for basic billets, steel strip and wire rods, special steels and stainless steel, and good business has been done in aircraft steels.      The heavy engineering branches have good orders on hand and railway material makers are in a fairly satisfactory position.South Wales.    There has been a steady demand for most types of iron and steel which seems likely to continue. Export demand has fallen off somewhat;, but in the home trade there is a good demand for structural and railway steel.      New tinplate orders have been moderate in volume, but most works are sold well forward and are operating at over 50^e of capacity.ENGINEERING.    The general activity of the industry was well maintained during the month of July, and the volume of new business obtained and of enquiries made showed no indication of any marked recession,  seasonal or otherwise.A preliminary investigation of the annual reports and balance sheets of representative firms in the engineering industry for the year 1934 shows that the year resulted in a definite increase in the total of net profits,  and also in some expansion in the amount of dividends paid.      A very satisfactory feature was that the allotments to reserve were considerably increased,MOTOR INDUSTRY.    The number of motor cars newly registered in June was 27.727 or 245 less than a year ago. Registrations of private cars and hackney vehicles showed an
increase of 510, while goods and other vehicles declined by 755.LIGHT METAL INDUSTRIES. Most of the non-ferrous metal mills are feeling some seasonal slowing down in demand.     A good output is, however, &quot;being maintained.. Copper is strong and lead and spelter have both improved their position during the month.The cutlery trade remains steady hut,  except in the case of safety razor blades and knives, lousiness is on the quiet side.      There is great activity in the small tool trades and in press work, while the lock and allied trades, enamelled hollow-ware and the foundry industry are &quot;brisk.      The needle and fishing tackle industries are reported to he satisfactory and the demand in the metallic &quot;bedstead trade remains steady.      There is some increase in enquiries for architectural metal work.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.    The general activity in the industry recorded in June continued in July.    In the ease of installation material and lighting apparatus the increased activity is spread over the whole electrical field.    There is no falling off in &quot;business on the heavy side.    Railway electrification has advanced, a step further &quot;by the contracts placed and. schemes announced &quot;by the various Railway Companies.    Exports show a satisfactory increase especially to British countries.    The consumption of electricity during June was 1,147 m. units, an increase of 9.3 per cent,  over June last year.
9 11OilLEATHER&apos;.    The world&apos;s hide markets showed little change during the month of July.      Salted South American frigorific hides declined somewhat in the latter part of the month and considerable business was done with North America, Germany and the United Kingdom.    Trade with European Countries is still difficult in the face of export prohibitions and tanners in this country could take more good class hides from the Continent.    Native hides have been in short supply and firm in price.Many sections of the leather industry experienced the customary falling off ia activity during July, though in some cases this was not so marked as usual.    The demand for sole leather was affected by the dry weather and there was a seasonal fall in the demand, for nearly all-classes of upper leather.    Calf upper leathers continue to be affected by heavy imports from Germany.    The trade in upholstery leathers was steady but the demand, for sheepskin leathers was variable.    There has been a good demand in certain sections of the trade on export account but in many cases business has been restricted owing to quotas and import restrictions,COTTON.    There was a marked increase in production and employment during the month.       Average weekly deliveries of raw cotton to spinners at 25,38 m. lbs. as against 23.52 m, lbs. in June woro the highest for some months.    Cotton prices fluctuated within a comparatively narrow range during the month.    On the whole spinners&apos; margins probably showed a further slight contraction. Agreement has now been reached on the new wages rates in the weaving section which came into force on August 1st.
Exports of cotton yarns were 11.9 m.  lbs.  in Julyas against 11*8 m. lbs. in June ana1 10.3 m. lbs. in July, 1934. Germany took smaller quantities than in June, but there were larger shipments to India and Holland.Exports of cotton   piece goods in July at 170 in.  sq.  yds showed an increase of 32 m.  sq. yds.  over June.      The tendenc for increased trade with British countries to eompensate for losses in foreign markets continues.      As compared with June, exports to nearly all British markets rose, particularly to British West Africa,  and India.      In Central and western Europe there was little change, apart from a small rise is. exports to Switzerland, and our trade with Greece and Turkey shoved some improvement.      Among South American countries, Argentine, Chile and Venezuela showed substantial increases as compared with the previous month.SILK AMD ARTIFICIAL BILK.      The demand for Rayon yarns from the dress goods and warp knitting trades is improvingj but the position in the stocking trade shows little change. Rayon yarn exports have shown some recovery after the fall in May.      An average demand for Rayon piece goods is expected for the Autumn season-      there has been no material change during the month in the position of the silk industry.RETAIL TRADE-.      The money value of retail sales in June was 5.8$ higher than in June 1934.      Apart from April, the rise for which amounted to 10.3$,  this is the largest increase recorded this year.      The increase in total sales was  shared by all districts.      The improvement in London (Central and West End)  (0.9$) was much less-marked than in the other four districts, for which increases varied from 2.7$ in London (Suburban)  to 7.9$ in the South of England.
CO-OPERATIVE TRADE.    The Co-operative Wholesale Society&apos;s sales for the five weeks ended 13th July showed a decrease of 4% over a year ago.      The weighted average of the wholesale prices of seven of the principal commodities showed an increase of 6.89% as compared with last year,  and the weighted average of the retail prices of the same commodities increased hy 5.52%.CANADA.    Economic conditions in Canada were slightly less favourable during June than in May.    The index of the physical volume of business declined from 103.2 to 99.2. Wholesale prices also show some recession,  the general index declining from 72.3 in May to 71.5 in June.      There was some gain in copper exports and lead production was at a higher level, but nickel exports declined.    The flour milling ana sugar refining industries were more active, hut there was some fslling-off in meat packing.    The decline in newsprint production was greater than the normal for the season.    There was increased activity in the primary iron and steel industry, hut motor car production showed some falling off.AUSTRALIA.    2,908,000 hales of wool have heen received into store &quot;between July 1st,  1934 and the end of June,  as compared with 2,726,000 a year ago.    Of these,  2,822,000 have heen sold for export as against 2,513,000 last season. Wheat and flour shipments for the period of 1st December to 23rd July are equivalent to 72.1 in. bushels of wheat as against 61.3 m. bushels for the same period last year. Exports of butter during July amounted to 2,483 tons as againfet 2,061 tons last year.    Total imports of merchandise in June were valued at  6.95 m. &apos; (Axis Australian currency)   as compared with  7.31 m,  a year ago.
SOUTH AFRICA.      Recent indices reflecting conditions for the country as a whole show a distinct retardation of the rate of recovery, although activity in the urhan centres is still proceeding at a high level.    Total exports in May were  12.68 m. as against  7.34 m.  a year earlier, increased exports of gold accounting for the difference.      Imports amounted to  5.88 m.  as against  5.37 m.  in May 1934.    The output of gold continues to he well maintained and the diamond mar ice c remains fairly steady. The outlook for crops is regarded as reasons.oly favourable, and markets for agricultural products have been steady.INDIA.      Both imports and exports decreased in June as compared with May, although they were slightly higher than in June 1934.    Imports amounted to 992 lakhs in June as compared with 1,181 lakhs in May, while exports were 1,281 lakhs ascompared with 3,522 lakhs in May,     The wholesale price inaex in June for Calcutta was 91 and shows no change as. compared with the previous month.Rainfall has been general throughout India and the monsoon is active.      Standing crops are reported to be in average to good condition.      The forecast of jute- acreage in India is 1,858,000 acres as compared with 2,611,000 acres last year.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.      Exports from Argentina show an increase of 16 per cent,  for the first six months of 1935 as compared with the same period of 1954, ana imports an increase of 10.75 per cent.      The proportion of British goods to total imports was slightly lower at 22 uer cent,   as compared with a year ago.      There was a notable decline in imports from Italy and Germany, but trade with Japan showed a considerable increase.    The outlook for 1935/36 in the wheat, linseed and oat crops is critical owing to the continuance of drought.    The demand for maize has been very poor and prices have weakened.    The Government has been
obliged to purchase at the guaranteed minimum price and the world situation may oblige them to operate on a considerable scale.There has been more activity in wool,  and meat shipments during the first half of 1935 increased by 4 per cent, in value as compared with last year.      Japan is increasing its hold of the cotton textile market and improvements in the quality of the goods offered suggests that competition may soon be felt in the better class fabrics at present supplied by Lancashire.      In the Exchange Market the tendency is for the official Importers&apos; Rate to move slowly against the peso, while the rate in the unofficial Market has the contrary tendency.Brazil.    The fiscal outlook continues obscure and exchange restrictions have again been imposed.      The  1,000,000 to be paid in cash under the -Anglo-Brazilian Payments Agreement is not yet forthcoming and the danger is foreseen of the accumulation of fresh blocked funds.    The outlooK for the Brazilian coffee trade is not regarded as favouraole, but shipments of cotton for the first four months of 1935 show a considerable increase over those for the same period of 1934.Chile.    Heavy imports have led to some shortage of exchange and to a reduction in the amount made available for Overseas    financial services.Peru.    An analysis of the Peruvian trade figure s for the first quarter of 19 35 shows that,  as compared with the same period last year,  imports into Peru from the United States, Japan and Germany have substantially increased, while those from the United Kingdom have diminished.    The latest reports record rapid deterioration in the quality of the cotton crop.
Uruguay.    Regulations have been made for the issue of the bonds for the liquidation of blocked exchange in accordance with the Trade Agreement with the United Kingdom.      Meat export during the first quarter of 1935 decreased by 9 per cent, compared with the same period of 1934,  but shipments to the United Kingdom were approximately the same.      The market in wool has been more active and stocks.are reduced.Colombia.    Exports in March and April were at a lower level than in January and February, but imports were higher. The tendency is for the value of Colombian currency to decline and the general outlook is obscure owing to difficulties in the world coffee situation.
