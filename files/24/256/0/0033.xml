[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.,   September 1935.SECRET.CP. 173 (35). , Copy No............CABINET.Situation on the North-West Frontier of India.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.I think it right to inform my colleagues of certain action which I have aiithorised the Government of India to take to deal with a difficult situation that has arisen in the country of the Mohmands on the North-West Frontier of India.2. The Mohmands are a tribe stretching from the Peshawar district across intervening tribal territory into Afghanistan as far as the neighbourhood of Jalalabad. The Lower Mohmands, in our tribal territory, are normally friendly, but the Upper Mohmands (north of the Nahakki and west of the Khapak Passes) are a source of constant trouble. Since these Upper Mohrnands live on both sides of the Afghan frontier they present a peculiarly difficult problem, because any action taken against them must have reactions in Afghanistan. Under present conditions such action is. liable to affect adversely the stability of the Afghan Government, which (especially as the present Afghan Government is friendly to us) it is greatly to oar interest to preserve. On the other hand, it is clearly necessa^ to protect British territory and friendly tribal territory from the attacks which are constantly threatened by the Upper Mohmands, stirred up by various agitators who live in or near their territory, and notably the Haji of Turangzai, a British subject who was outlawed in 1915. Since that date up to the present vear we have been engaged in serious hostilities with the Upper Mohmands in 1915-17, 1927, 1930, and 19.33. In 1933, as the result of attacks on our friendlies, it was decided to construct a road up the Gandab Valley in the latter&apos;s country to a point just south of the Nahakki Pass. This was effected by the military operations of that year. The operations culminated in a settlement with the Upper Mohmands (known as the Ghalanai Agreement), under which the tribe gave assurances against further aggression and Government reserved the right to extend the road into Upper Mohmand country if they indulged in further hostilities against us.3. During the last few weeks attacks have been made on the Gandab road by the Upper Mohmands, instigated by the Haji&apos;s son, Badshah Gul. The Government of India decided to send troops up the valley to protect the road and clear out the hostiles. This was effected by an advance of the Peshawar and Nowshera Brigades on 23rd August, but the hostile lashkars are still in being around the Nahakki Pass.4. It has been strongly represented to me by the local authorities and the Government of India that in order to obtain an adequate settlement with the Upper Mohmands on this occasion, it is necessary to inflict a further lesson on them for their breach of the Ghalanai Agreement. The Government of India accordingly proposed that the troops should immediately advance to a suitable point a few miles north of the pass and prolong the road thereto, and that, in order to procure a cessation of hostilities, the tribesmen should be informed that we intended to go no further than such point, and also that, if they acquiesced in our peaceful advance and in the construction of the road, the air action which is being taken against them would be discontinued.5. There is also a much more extensive project which has been under discussion in India from time to time during recent years for an extension of the Gandab road into the heart of Upper Mohmand country and the construction of another road through the neighbouring country of Bajaur, which is also chronically disturbed and subject to no political control. This ambitious project has been mentioned again in the correspondence regarding the present Mohmand situation. My advisers and I are extremely doubtful of the expediency of embarking in the near future on the far-reaching commitments which such a project would involve. In addition to the grave reactions which such a plan would be likely to have in Afghanistan, there 4059      65   9.35
are at present unsettled conditions on certain other parts of the Frontier. There is restlessness also among the Moslems in the Punjab following upon the recent troubles at Lahore, and there is undoubtedly a certain degree of communication and sympathy between the Moslems of British India and their fellow religionists beyond the administrative Border. It is also by no means unlikely, though we have no definite evidence, that the Italians are trying to create embarrassments for us in that part of the world through the agency of Amanullah, the ex-King of Afghanistan, who is residing in Rome. The Government of India have not at present made any proposal of the extensive nature indicated at the beginning of this paragraph, but have confined themselves lo the very limited objective described above. At the same time the possibility has to be borne in mind that the prolongation of the road over the Nahakki Pass, while it will undoubtedly greatly facilitate the carrying out in future of measures to deal with trouble in that area, may constitute a provocation to the Upper Mohmands and involve us in commitments for its defence, and a logical demand for the further extension of the road into the heart of the Upper Mohmand country.6. After careful consideration both of the reasons for the Government of India&apos;s present proposal, namely, the necessity of endeavouring to secure a liquidation of the immediate trouble with the Upper Mohmands, and of the drawbacks attaching to it, namely, that even this limited proposal may cause trouble for the Afghan Government, and may tend to draw us into the larger project referred to above at an inconvenient time, I came to the conclusion, in which the Foreign Office concurred, that the balance of argument was in favour of approving it. I have therefore sanctioned the Government of India&apos;s limited objective with the caveat that every care should be taken to keep in view the desirability of limiting as far as possible the scope both of the present operations and of future commitments.India Office,.17th September 1935.Z.
