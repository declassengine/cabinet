SB C R E to cp.155( 55). COPY NO.C A B I N E T.BEET___SUGARoREPORT OF CABINET COMMITTEE.lo At their Meeting on Wednesday,  22nd May5  1935,(Cabinet 50(35) Conclusion 4)  the Cabinet agreed-That  the Report of the United Kingdom Sugar Industry Inquiry Committee (Cmdo4871)  should he referred to a Cahinet Committee composed as follows?-The Chancellor of the Exchequer (In the Chair), The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, The Secretary of State for the Colonies, The Secretary of State for 3Gotland, The President of the Board of Trade, and The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries..On the reconstruction of the Government9  LordEustace Percy was added to the Committeeo2o At their first Meetings  the Committee decided,  inview of the complexity of the subject and the number of technical considerations involved/ to refer certain preliminary questions for examination by a Committee of Officials representing the Treasury., Customs and Excise, Dominions Offices Colonial Office,, Board of Trade, Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, Foreign Office and India Office, under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry Fountain.3. That Committee presented three separate Reports,  thegeneral effect of which is to recommend the continuance of State assistance on the lines of the Scheme as set out in Chapter X of the Majority Report of the Greene Committee,
with a limitation of output of subsidised sugar to 560,000 tons of white sugar?    the amalgamation of all the Sugar Beet Factories in a single Corporation, under compulsion if necessary?    the appointment of an independent Sugar Commission, with general powers of supervision over the Factories?    and certain other measures designed to reduce the cost of State assistance in future      The Official committee however, recommend the rejection of the Greene Committee&apos;s proposal that the Sugar Commission should be given power,  in effect, to prescribe a minimum price for refined sugar?    and indicate various objections to the grant of a similar power to prescribe a maximum price. They further recommend that an effort should be made by the United Kingdom Government to break the present deadlock in the negotiations for the conclusion of a new international agreements with a view to the raising of the world price of sugar?    and that with this object in view the Dominion and Colonial sugar exporting Governments be invited forthwith to consent to a scheme of restriction,  if that should be necessary as part of a satisfactory world agreement..4. A summary of the Official Committee&apos;s conclusions andrecommendations (Paper NpoBoS.(35)7)  is attached-5o After very careful consideration we have come tothe conclusion that whatever might be said against the policy of subsidising the production of sugar-beet in this Country, if the Government were free to deal with the situation de novo, under present conditions there is no practical alternative but to provide for the maintenance of the industry.      For this purpose a measure of State assistance is still necessary, and we are of opinion that the Scheme proposed by the Official Committee is the best method that can be devised for dealing with the situation.      We therefore recommend its adoption by the Cabineto
6o The future cost of State assistance on these linescannot yet he accurately determined;, hut on present evidence and subject to certain assumptions we estimate it as follows!-Approximate costs1936o      (i) Subsidy on 5609000 tens sugar at basic rate of 3/10do9 plus transitional allowance at 9do   (4.7)         2957O9O0Q(ii) Duty preference  S9 85Q9Q00 594209Q0Q1937c       (i) Subsidy on 5603000 tons at basic rate of 3/10do plus allowance at 4-g-d.

The industry however, should be given the right to submit evidence to the Sugar Commission,, before 19389  that a further period of grace should be allowed before the rate of assistance
is brought clown to the basic rate only.      Further that rate should be liable to reconsideration after 1940 on a footing which would ensure that the State would participate,  on a pre-determined basis, with the industry, in the profits arising thereafter?    the formula to be such as will give the Corporation reasonable incentive to continue to increase its efficiency.     The rates throughout are liable to vary with variations from certain assumed levels in the wholesale price of white sugar and in the cost of beets.7. If these proposals are approved by the Cabinet inprinciple,  we recommend that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries be authorised to bring the industry, both factories and refiners, into consultation, before any announcement of. the Governments decision is made, and to invite them to co-operate with the Government in carrying out their proposals.      We propose to inform the refiners that the Sugar Commission will not be authorised to prescribe either a maximum or a minimum price.8. The result of these  consultations can be reportedto the Cabinet at their Meeting next week, with a draft of the statement of Government policy to be made in the House of Commons before the Summer Recess.Signed on behalf of the Committee, N.

SUGAR .FINAL REPORT OF SIR HENRY FOUNTAINf8 COMMITTEE.I attach for the convenience of Ministers the whole of the conclusions and recommendations in cur First, Second and Third Reports.The First Report has he en circulated as B. S. (35) 4. The Second Report has been circulated as B.S. (35) 5. and the Third Report as E. S.   (35) 6.19th July,  1935.
IS?INTER-DEPARTMEHTAL COMMITTEE ON SUGAR. FINAL REPORT,Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations-contained in First, Second and Third Reports.The United Kingdom Beet Sugar Industry.(1)    The principle of limitation   of output should he accepted, as recommended &quot;by the Greene Committee.(2)    The oxitput should he such as will maintain the existing factories in efficient operation.(3)    Since the amount required to satisfy this recommendation is estimated under normal conditions to &quot;be 560,000 tons of white sugar, the total output of sugar eligible for subsidy should be limited to that amount per annum.(4)    Any sugar produced in excess of 560,000 tons should be eligible for the duty preference (at present 4s.9d. per cwt.) but not for subsidy.(5)    The rate of assistance should henceforth be determined by the requirements of the lowest cost factories (subject to a reasonable allowance, for a period not exceeding 2 years, to enable the higher cost factories to be brought up to the desired level) provided that this formula shall be so interpreted as to offer sufficient inducement to the factories to place contracts with the growers,  for whose interests the subsidy is primarily designed, up  to the amount of beet required to produce 560,000 tons of white sugar.(6)    Owing to cost-differences of a permanent character, the expense to the State of maintaining the present restricted beet
acreage arm tlie requisite factory capacity, on the basis of their present geographical distribution can only be reduced to a minimum if the factories are amalgamated into a single Corporation as recommended by the Greene Committee.    Otherwise, a rate of assistance would be necessary which, while no more than sufficient for the higher-cost units, would be in excessof the requirements of the remainder as has been the case in-the past.      Further,  it is only through amalgamation and the resulting administrative flexibility that the effect on manufacturing costs of seasonal variations in beet supplies can be minimised.(7)      The factories should accordingly be invited to agree forthwith to  the principle of amalgamation, with effect as from a date not later than the 1st April,1937, being told that -(a) the payment of capital allowances for the year 1935 will be conditional upon the factories&apos; willing co-operation in this matter, and(b) if they decline to do so,  the Government will in due course impose a scheme upon them, under powers to be obtained from Parliament for the purpose.(8)      As an interim arrangement,  assistance should be granted to the individual factories at a rate not exceeding in the aggregate the estimated cost of assistance in the first year after amalgamation has been put into operation, but distributed in such a manner as will keep all the factories in being until amalgamation takes place, without giving excessive profits to the present low-cost units.(9)      The scheme proposed by the Refiners as an alternative to the Greene Committee&apos;s scheme should be rejected;    it is financially unattractive to the State and is open to other objections including that of conferring a virtual monopoly on existing refiners.
(10)      The Government should give effect,  as from a date not later than 1st April,  1936,  to the recommendations of the Greene Committee for encouraging the production of white sugar by the factories and so reducing the cost of maintaining the home industry;    these recommendations were -(a) the removal of the present duty and subsidybias in favour of raw sugar production, and(b) the allocation to the factories of a firm shareof 600,000 tons, equal to about one third of the home white sugar market.(11)    The Greene Committee&apos;s recommendation that power should be taken to fix a minimum refining margin should be rejected as involving unnecessary responsibility for prices and undue interference with private enterprise;    theeffect of variations in the refining margin on the revenue of the factories should be discounted by adjustments in thecurrent rate of assistance;    in so far as these adjustmentsincrease the cost of maintaining the home industry,  theExchequer can be recouped by an increase in the revenueduties.(12)    The question whether power should be taken to fix a maximum refining margin raises political issues on which we do not feel able to advise.      (See para. 11, Third Report,)(13)    Before any announcement is made by the Government, we regard it as desirable that the industry (both factories and refiners)  should be brought into consultation, and invited to cooperate with the Government in carrying out    their proposals .(14)    We have assumed that a permanent Sugar Commission will be set up as recommended by the Greene Committee, but we have not felt it necessary to examine in detail its powers and duties except in so far as they appeared relevant to the matters dealt with in our Reports .The International Position. (15)      It is desirable that the Government should make an effort to break the present deadlock in the negotiations
for the conclusion of a new international agreement,  taut it would be of little use for them to take the initiative at this stage unless  they are prepared with some definite proposal -(IB)    Accordingly Australia,  South Africa and the Colonies should be invited forthwith to undertake,  if necessary and as part of a satisfactory world agreement,   to limit their future exports  to a figure 7 per cent below their peak figures (that being the ratio of reduction applied to United Kingdom production).(17)      It would be useless   to from India or theIrish Free State assurances as  to restriction,  but the former should be asked to renew her offer not to export Sugar for 5 years .(18)    If necessary with a view to persuading the Dominions  to give this undertaking,   the Chancellor of trie Exchequer might be prepared to guarantee the continuance for at least 5 years  of the present margin of preference,   subject to compliance with any international obligations.(19)    In any International Agreement an effort should be made to obtain acceptance of  the principle that State assistance,  In whatever form,  should everywhere be diminished as  the world price rises above a given level.(20)    If international negotiations should again fail, we are unable to suggest any unilateral action on the part of the United Kingdom Government which could prevent a fall in prices without involving undesirable consequences.      If such a fall should take place and should prejudice Empire producers,   the situation could best be met by a direct addition to  the extent that may be necessary to the State assistance accorded to them.      It is  therefore all the more desirable to make every attempt to secure International agreement.h July,   1935.
