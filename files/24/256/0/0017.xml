EIGHTEENTH REPORT.The economic outlook for the next few years.BY our terms of reference we are directed to supervise the preparation of periodical reports on the economic situation; and in accordance with these instructions, we now submit the eighteenth of these periodical reports. The report represents the general views of the committee, without attempting to-express the different shades of opinion held by individual members.2. The present report is concerned less with the immediate economic situation than with the probable course of economic events in the next few years.. We have therefore found it convenient to omit the largely statistical summary of recent events which usually forms part 1 of our reports.3. We have devoted considerable attention to the housing situation. For in our opinion developments in this field will be of decisive importance in determining the limits of our present industrial recovery.(Signed on behalf of the committee) :J. C. STAMP, Chairman.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, July 29, 1935.
THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS.I. Introductory.1. It is our intention in the present report to consider the economic scene from a rather different angle from that which we usually choose when preparing our periodic surveys. We are generally concerned with the events of the immediate past and the prospects for the immediate future. The outlook in this respect, however, continues to be dominated by the uncertain financial prospects in the industrial countries of western Europe, prospects which we have discussed at some length in our recent reports. We turn, therefore, to the consideration of more fundamental tendencies, and the part which they may be expected to play in determining the course of economic events in Great Britain over the next few years. In particular, we wish to examine the situation in regard to house building, which may be expected to have a very important effect in determining the present period of comparatively good trade.II. Retrospect.2. We may begin our survey with a brief retrospect of the events leading up to the recent depression and the present recovery. Most periods of bad trade in the past have been the consequence of an over rapid development in some sphere or other of economic life; and the depression which began in 1929 was no exception to this rule. But in the boom years preceding the depression Great Britain had for a number of reasons shared only to a limited extent in the surrounding activity. The chief centres of expansion had been in the United States, where there had been an unprecedented expansion of constructional activity, in central and western Europe, where the damage and disorganisation caused by the war were being made good with the assistance of loans from this country and the United States, and in the countries producing primary products which also, for the first time since the war began, found the capital markets of England and America open to them, and who proceeded to borrow on -a lavish scale. In all these countries borrowers were prepared to pay very high rates of interest, which naturally reacted on the rates charged to borrowers in Great Britain. Moreover, as we now know, large liquid liabilities had accumulated in London as the result of the depreciation of continental currencies, and, as was apparent at the time, the expansion of British exports was hampered by the rise of new competitors and by changes in the nature of demand. This gave rise to a pressure on the exchanges which prevented the monetary authorities in London, hampered as they then were by the necessity of preserving the gold reserves against foreign drains, from pursuing a policy which would have made money available for development at home, at the rates of interest at which alone this development would have been possible. Throughout this period Britain&apos;s exporting industries, although they were suffering from underlying difficulties which gave them a definitely depressed appearance, were supported by the general stimulus to international trade provided by the enormous scale upon which inter-national lending was then being undertaken. At the same time the industries dependent on home development, although they appeared to be in a comparatively prosperous condition, were prevented from expanding adequately by the high interest rates then prevailing.3. In 1930 the market for foreign loans collapsed, partly as a result of the financial catastrophe in the United States in the previous year, partly as a result of the accumulating evidence of over-borrowing on the part of the countries which had previously been in the market. And as a consequence of this collapse international trade underwent a severe contraction, especially that branch of it which depended on the absorption of manufactured goods by countries specialised in the production of raw materials. The brunt of this contraction was borne by Great Britain, whose exporting industries were handicapped by the unduly high value of the pound, and whose free market, as it then was,
provided a convenient outlet for the output of other industrial countries which could no longer find ready purchasers in the less industrialised parts of the world. The growth of competitive imports and the falling off of exports were primarily responsible for the deterioration of our industrial position in the years 1930 and 1931.4. Nor at this time could the situation be alleviated by an expansion of internal capital development. For the slump had the effect of aggravating the exchange difficulties from which Great Britain was suffering, and thus prevented any substantial reduction in the level of interest rates. It has always been the habit of the primary producing countries who finance their exports through London, to maintain substantial sterling assets as a reserve against the contingency of a period of bad trade. When the slump came they naturally drew upon these reserves. Sterling was, therefore, subject to pressure from three directions, first by reason of the excessive importation of manufactured goods into Great Britain from the continent and from America; secondly by reason of the withdrawal of balances by countries of what we should now call the sterling area to pay off debts incurred in dollars, francs, and other currencies; and finally, as the difficulties of Great Britain&apos;s position became increasingly manifest by the growing nervousness of holders of the liquid claims on London, which, as we have already remarked, were a legacy of the continental post-war depreciations. In these circumstances, the primary preoccupation of our monetary authorities was inevitably with the external stability of the currency, and the possibility of promoting recovery by stimulating internal activity through lowered interest rates had to be neglected. Indeed, the attempts which were then made to stimulate internal activity directly by a considerable programme of public expenditure, though mitigating the severity of unemployment, could only in the circumstances of the time add to difficulties of the exchange situation.5. It was only after the crisis of 1931 that Great Britain was in a position to adopt a policy which brought with it any hope of a real recovery. From our present point of view two developments which have occurred since the crisis are of especial importance, first the consolidation, in fact if not in name, of the &quot; sterling area &quot;; secondly, the inauguration of a persistent policy of cheap money, both these developments being greatly assisted by the re-establishment of our national finances upon a satisfactory basis. As their consequence, we have seen on the one hand the growth of an area in which international trade has been able to develop on a comparatively secure footing, only hampered in a minor degree by currency and other restrictions; and, on the other hand, a marked revival of internal activity. Against these advantages of the divorce of the pound from gold, we must set the very severe dislocation of international trade with countries not on the sterling standard, a dislocation which was materially aggravated by the subsequent devaluation of the dollar.III. The home market for consumers&apos; goods.6. With these considerations in mind we may turn to the examination of the actual course of employment in the last six years, and we may take as a starting point a table of figures which we first compiled for the purpose of our fourteenth report, showing the composition of the demand for labour in insured industries, under certain broad headings, since the beginning of the depression. In that report we suggested that it would be unwise to place too great reliance on these figures. In bringing them up to date we have been forced to make the assumption that the rate of recruitment in each group of industries since July 1934, which is the last date for which figures of the insured persons attached to each industry are available, was the same as in the period from July 1933 to July 1934. In fact, however, there can be little doubt that this is not the case, and that in the building industries in particular, a higher rate of recruitment has prevailed. Moreover, the estimates of employment lost and gained through foreign trade are based on variations in the volume of imports and exports, and take no account of changes in the productivity of labour, though the statistics suggest that this has recently increased materially. It is probable, therefore, that the contribution of foreign trade to the sum of employment is somewhat exaggerated.

7. In our fourteenth report we drew attention to the main changes in the composition of employment since 1929, namely, the increase in the numbers required to produce goods currently consumed in Great Britain, and the falling off in the net demand for labour in foreign trade. The question which concerns us at present is whether, as more normal conditions establish themselves, the first of these changes in the distribution of productive resources is likely to be maintained. This is a question of considerable importance to the prospects of employment in the next few years. Many branches of capital producing industries are still depressed considerably below the level of activity prevailing in 1929. As the general improvement continues, these industries may be expected to absorb more labour into employment. If the proportion of labour required for the production of goods and services for home consumption is maintained, an improvement in employment in the capital producing industries entails an equal proportionate improvement in total employment. If, however, this proportion shows a tendency to slip back to the level of 1929, the prospects of an improvement in total employment are less bright. Expressed in percentages of total employment, the demand for labour to produce goods and services for the home market in the last six years has been as follows : Table 2.Percentage of total employment in the United Kingdom devoted to production for the home market in insured industries.	1929.	1930.	1931.	1932.	1933.	1934.Labour required to produce goods and services consumed in the home mar-ket as a percentage of total labour employed...	66-1	71-1	71-8	73-6	73-4	72-1of which manufactures represent and services represent	35-9 30-2	36-3 34-8	36-2 35-6	36-0 37-6	36-2 37-2	35-5 36-68. What then are the causes which have brought about this great improve-ment in internal trade? There are, we suppose, two principal explanations. First, the great improvement which the slump caused in the terms on which British exports can be exchanged for British imports has resulted in a considerable fall in the cost of living of British working class families. The average wages of a man in full employment are to-day in the neighbourhood of 95 per cent, of the wages obtained in 1929; and there is no reason to suppose that at the moment earnings are diminished by the prevalence of short-time to a greater extent than in that year.* But the prices of foodstuffs have fallen by approximately 20 per cent, since that time. Thus, assuming that food expenditure accounted for approximately 50 per cent, of total expenditure in 1929, and that the ordinary working man maintains to-day the same standard as previously, he must have available for expenditure on other items  55 for every  50 he spent in 1929, an increase of 10 per cent. If account is taken of the fact that quite  20 of the  50 available in 1929 must have been spent on rent, and probably is still so spent, the increase in income available for expenditure on items other than food and rent becomes even more impressive. Thus a substantial part of the increase is employment for home consumption must have been accounted for by greater expenditure by the working classes on goods and services produced at home, as a result of the improvement which has occurred in the level of real wages.9. Secondly, as the result of the slump and its consequences there has been a re-distribution of incomes favourable to an increase in expenditure. Moreover, the fall in the rate of interest has materially reduced the incentive to save amongst those persons who formerly were in the habit of saving. To some extent, this is a phenomenon normally associated with the onset of a severe depression. There are a large number of corporate bodies and the like whose receipts  are* This was not the case in the worst year of the slump. Investigations carried out by the Ministry of Labour in 1927 and 1931 suggest that at that time earnings may have been reduced by the incidence of short-time by about 2 per cent.
immediately affected by a depression but whose payments must remain substantially unchanged. We may instance not only the Government itself and the Unemployment Insurance Fund, but also public companies whose dividends are declared on the results of a past year&apos;s working. The recovery from the last depression, however, has been marked by a more permanent readjustment which has prevented a return to the position that obtained at the outset of the depression. The great fall which has occurred in the rate of interest, and in the earnings of companies, has affected especially the incomes of those members of the community who are normally in the habit of making substantial savings. This fall in incomes naturally has had a less than proportionate effect upon their expenditure; for few people are prepared to reduce their standard of life in order to maintain their rate of saving, especially at a time when they see the general value of their estates increasing as the result of a general rise in the value of securities. Moreover, the fact that the incomes of the saving classes have been reduced by the establishment of lower interest rates more than have been the incomes of the rest of the community insures that a larger proportion of the total national income, of the community shall be expended on current consumption.10. In our last report we gave reasons for holding that in default of an improvement in investment activity or in the export trade an improvement in the demand for products for home consumption requires fundamental readjustments to take place. We have just described how in the period 1929-34 such readjustments were effected by a substantial fall in the comparative costs of British imports, and by a substantial fall in the rate of interest and in the normal level of industrial profits. It is therefore not surprising to find that in spite of a reduction in the numbers employed in investment activity and in foreign trade from approximately 3,400,000 in 1929 to 3,000,000 in 1934, there was a substantial rise in the numbers employed in satisfying the demand for the home consumption market from approximately 7,500,000 in 1929 to 7,800,000 in 1934. Now, however, these readjustments seem to have been completed, and in future we can only look for an expansion in internal consumption demand, as activity expands in the field of home investment and foreign trade. For this reason the future course of employment is now very much dependent on the course of activity in these industries, and the greater part of the remainder of this report is devoted to an examination of their prospects.11. We cannot, however, assume that in future every increase in home investment and export trade will be associated with a proportionate improvement in the home consumption market. For reasons which we also gave in our last report further increases in activity are likely to be associated with the emergence of higher profits in particular industries and there may thus be a tendency for the general level of industrial profits to expand more rapidly than output, even though there is no rise in the general rate of interest. This in turn, by the converse process of reasoning to that employed in paragraph 9 above, will tend to diminish the proportion of current incomes expended on current consumption. Moreover, in the sphere of foreign trade the forces depressing the prices of British imports have for some time ceased to operate; and in future we may see a contrary trend. An expansion, of British foreign trade is likely to be associated with an increase in the prices of British imports, and a consequent reduction in the surplus of wages which the working classes have available for expenditure on the products of home industry. We must assume therefore that in future the demand for labour in industries catering for the home consumption market will be less resilient than that in other industries.12. We do not wish to leave the subject of home consumption demand without calling attention to a very remarkable change which has taken place in its composition, namely, the great increase in the importance of the service group of industries. It will be observed from the table in paragraph 6 that the numbers employed in these industries increased throughout the depression, even when employment in every other sphere was declining. By 1934 employment within this group had increased by 350,000 in comparison with 1929, though employment in manufacturing for the home consumption market was still 65,000 lower than in 1929. In some respects the figures given present an incomplete picture. There has probably been some shift in the nature of industrial status in these industries. There are possibly fewer persons working on their own account and more as the employees of others. The figures, moreover, refer to employment between the ages of 16 and 64, and take no account of the employment of juveniles of the
ages of 14 and 15. It so happens, however, that juvenile labour is to a very large extent concentrated in the distributive trades, which are included in the service group. Moreover, there have been important changes in the numbers of juveniles of 14 and 15 years of age available for employment since 1929. In that year the juveniles available were those who had been born in the years 1914 and 1915, before the birth rate had been materially affected by the war. They must have numbered approximately 930,000. By the end of 1932, in which year the shortage of births in the war was having its full effect, these numbers had fallen to 736,000* By the end of 1934, on the other hand, the post-war increase in births was making itself felt and the numbers available for employment had risen again to 922,000, and by the end of this year it is estimated that their numbers will reach 1,049,000. The effect of a decline in juvenile labour at a time when the demand for labour in general was very slack must have been that many boys and girls of 16 who would normally have found more lucrative occupations remained on for an extra year in the distributive trades. Similarly, an improved demand for labour coincided with an increase in the supply of juvenile labour,, and it is reasonable to suppose that boys and girls of 16 are now leaving the distributive trades in exceptionally large numbers. Thus, though the actual increase in employment in tne service group of industries between 1929 and 1934 is probably correctly given by the figures in table 1, the annual increases are possibly quite misleading. The increases in the years 1929-32 may have been smaller, and the increase in the year 1934 much larger than appears at first sight.13. The relative increase in the numbers employed in the service industries; no doubt reflects a very real alteration in popular tastes and habits. It is, indeed, a matter of common observation that increased facilities for transport and entertainment are absorbing a larger share of the ordinary man&apos;s expenditure.. But quite apart from changes in taste, the distribution of employment between manufacture and services has probably been affected in some degree by the considerable improvement in productive technique which appears to have occurred recently in manufacturing industry as a whole. This is brought out in the following table, in which employment production and productivity per head in manufacturing industries are shown at quarterly intervals since 1929.Table 3.Indices of employment, production, and productivity per head in manufacturing and mining industries in the United Kingdom in the period 1929-34, by-quarters.

It should be observed that an increase in productivity per head does not necessarily increase the fund available for the payment of wages. In the first place this fund may be diminished by a reduction in prices at which goods are sold. Secondly, an increase in-productivity is likely to be associated with an increase in the capital employed in industry, an increase which must involve higher interest payments.* See the Ministry of Labour Gazette October 1934, p. 348.[11926]
14. It will be observed that in the opening stages of the depression productivity per head showed a tendency to decline, presumably as a result of short-time working. In&apos; 1934, however, there appears to have been a very important improvement, productivity per head rising to a level nearly 8 per cent, higher than that prevailing in 1929. Thus, although the actual numbers employed in manufacture for the home consumption market showed a decline between 1929 and 1934, there is reason to suppose that the actual volume of goods sold in this market showed a substantial increase.IY. Home investment..15. Home investment comprises a number of fields of activity each subject to rather, different influences. We may distinguish (i) replacements of plant, iii) extensions of plant and new factory building, (iii) public works contracting, (iv) repairs to houses, and (v) new house building. Activity directed towards the maintenance and extension of industrial plant and buildings must be primarily affected by the state of demand for industrial goods and the possibility of earning normal profits in industry. It must also be influenced by the liquid position of industrial enterprises, and by the possibility of raising capital freely in the new issue market. Public works contracting is largely, but not exclusively, dependent on public policy. House repairs are a fairly constant factor, which must be expected to move in much the same manner as expenditure on consumption goods. House building depends on the possibility of building houses at a price which, having regard to the current level of interest rates, can be let at the prevailing rents. Thus, thpugh activity in each of these groups is likely to be influenced in some degree by changes in the rate of interest, the extent of their response to such changes may vary considerably.16. The figures in table I indicate that by the beginning of 1935 the employment afforded by home investment activity somewhat exceeded that afforded in the same field in 1929. There has been, however, a very considerable change in the contribution to this total made by each of the groups which we have distinguished. Building has expanded, but engineering activity is still somewhat lower than before the slump. Moreover, within the field of building, the building of dwelling houses has shown a very large increase, whereas other kinds of building are still considerably below the level of 1929. We may attempt to make a more detailed examination of the available statistical material. The census of production of 1930 indicated that the building of new dwelling houses accounted for rather less than one-third of the value of the gross output of the building industry in that year; it may therefore be taken to have employed approximately 417,000 men. On this basis we may estimate the numbers of men employed on the building of dwelling houses from 1929 to 1934. We must, however, make some allowance for the increase in productivity per head in 1934, mainly occurring in the industries producing building materials; and also for the fact that the houses built have tended lately to be of a smaller average size, employing a smaller number of workpeople. Making a reasonable allowance for these factors in the light of the information available, we may calculate the numbers employed in the construction of new dwelling houses as follows :

These plans are, of course, passed before the building is actually begun. If we relate the building.plans passed in one year to the employment in the following year, we find a reasonable degree of correspondence, as may be seen in the following table, in which both sets of figures are reduced to percentages of the 1929 figure.Table 5.Building plans passed, and estimated employment for buildings other thandwelling houses.1929 = 100.	1929.	1930.	1931.	1932.	1933.	1934.Building plans passed in the preceding year Estimated employment	100-0 100-0	105-4 105-7	101-1 98-8	82-4 86-2	71-1 78-6	78-0 82-6Building plans approved for building other than dwelling houses showed a marked expansion in 1934, rising to 96 per cent, of the 1929 level, and we may therefore anticipate a considerable increase of employment in this field in 1935.17. As a result of this examination we may estimate that the position of employment in investment industries for the home market to-day compares as follows with the position in 1929 : Table 6.Employment in the investment industries in the United Kingdom in 1929 and1935.1929.1935.Increase or decrease.Construction of new dwelling houses Construction and repairs of other buildings and worksIron and steel production and engineering   ..

Obviously-, the prospects for further expansion are very much greater in the case of the two latter groups, which are still comparatively depressed, than in the case of house building the activity of which is now on an unprecedented scale. But within these fields we cannot but suggest that the prospects are comparatively good. In our last report we suggested that recovery in this country has now reached a point where the productive capacity of certain industries is beginning to be severely taxed. Demands for new plant and building are likely to come in increasing quantities from these industries; and as recovery proceeds more and more industries are likely to be brought within this class. Thus, the recovery in the engineering trades, which up till now has been largely based on more confident replacement programmes in industry in general, is likely now to be supplemented by programmes of expansion in the more favoured industries. This recovery should also embrace the building of new factories. Indeed, a substantial indication of such a development is contained in recent figures for building plans passed. Provided always that the demand for new houses shows no tendency to decline we may look for a. continued expansion in employment in home investment. As far as the engineering trades are concerned, the low level of employment compared with 1929 suggests that there are adequate facilities available for meeting this demand. The building industries, however, are in a quite different position. Employment is already well in excess of the 1929 level, and it is quite possible that schemes&apos; for expansion may be held up by the difficulty of securing adequate building labour, especially in those areas which are at present expanding most rapidly.Y. Housing.18. &quot;We have qualified our expectations of an improvement in employment in the demand for labour for home investment by the proviso that there should be no tendency for the demand for new houses to fall off. At the moment, indeed, there is no sign of this. The statistics of building plans passed continue to forecast an increasing output. But in the long run no prediction can be made with greater confidence than that the present rate of house building cannot be maintained. Indeed, this is obvious when we consider that if houses continued to be built at the present rate, the total number of houses would be doubled in thirty years, or, alternatively, that the maximum number of houses which our present population could require would be entirely replaced in forty years. It is a very badly built house which does not last twice that time. Just as at one time an expansion of house building offered, the greatest hope for Great Britain&apos;s recovery from depression, so to-day the possibility of a decline of house building must be one of the major sources of anxiety as to the continuation of the present recovery.19. There have been many attempts to estimate the probable extent of housing demand. They are, however, largely vitiated from our present point of view by the fact that they have been undertaken with the object of determining the minimum number of houses required to establish a particular standard of housing accommodation based on some assessment of absolute needs. We need hardly point out that this is quite a different object from that which we have in mind, namely, the determination of the number of houses for which the present population, with its great diversity of incomes, is prepared to pay a rent high enough to make house building profitable, building costs and rates of interest being what they are to-day. The problem of overcrowding is of a quite different character. So long as house space can command a price, families whose means are for any reason inadequate must be expected to be economical in their use of it. The building boom will come to an end, because it is no longer profitable to build houses, long before rents have fallen to such a point that the poorest families can afford the standard of housing which social considerations make desirable.20. The most authoritative survey of the housing requirements of the decade 1931-41 is contained in the Eegistrar-Generaks report^ on housing published in connection with the census of 1931. The relevant argument of this report may be summarised as follows. The number of private families enumerated at each census up to and including 1911 has a fairly constant relation to various indices derived from the population statistics, based on such figures as the number of married women and the number of widows and widowers.  In the decade 1911 to* Stationery Office Publication 70-125-0-31 of 1935.
900,000These additions, together with the 800,000 houses necessary to provide for the increase that would occur in the number of private families in the decade 1931-1941 on the assumption that in this respect social habits remain the same, bring the total number of houses which must be built in that decade to 1,700,000. And this is the estimate given by the Registrar-General.21. It may be observed at once that not all this increase in requirements will have already become effective. The natural increase in private families since the date of the census was probably not much more than 400,000, requiring perhaps 350,000 houses to contain them. The slum clearance schemes have so far only resulted in the closure of about 40,000 houses. Thus on the above estimate the total number of new houses which could have been disposed of between the census date and to-day, even if the whole improvement in housing accommodation anticipated for the decade had been concentrated in its first four years, would be no more than a million. In fact, however, a million new houses have already been built since the date of the census. And yet it would be impossible to assert that vacant houses are to-day available in the same numbers as before the war. We may, therefore, assert that the Registrar-General&apos;s estimate is too low. There must have been some factor at work causing an abnormal increase in the demand for houses.22. The explanation is almost certainly that the number of families has been :growing more rapidly than the indices derived from population indices would suggest. The extent to which people associate together to form a family is determined in part by natural convenience, in part by economic considerations. Very few people live alone by preference. On the other hand, people tend to live together to a greater extent than they would be led to by purely personal considerations because by so doing they effect a saving in rent, and in other items of expenditure, such as heating and lighting, and in a less degree in food, and are thus able to improve their standard of living in other directions. In so far as the cost of the above items of expenditure diminishes, the relative advantage of living together also diminishes and private families tend to disintegrate. The effect of recent social legislation has been to improve the status of a large number.921, however, the increase in the number of private families was very much less than these indices would suggest as likely. This is evidence that at the date of the 1921 census the number of private families was reduced by an exceptional cause, namely, by persons who would normally have wished to live separately being forced to live together by reason of the shortage of housing accommodation. By 1931, however, the number of private families had expanded by an amount sufficient to make good the deficiency at the previous census. It may therefore be inferred that the state-assisted building effort in the decade 1921-31 had made good the housing shortage caused by the war, and the pre-war standard of housing accommodation had been re-established. Nevertheless, evidence of a continued housing shortage still remained in the shape of an unduly low propor-tion of vacant premises, judged by pre-war experience. In the decade 1931-41 the number of private families may be expected, on the basis of the indices already referred to, to expand by 917,000 or by 9 per cent.; and on the basis of the existing relation between houses and private families this should call for 771,000 new houses. To this increase, which is necessary to maintain the pre-war standard of housing, certain additions are required in order to obtain a total of the houses which must be built within the decade 1931-1941. These additions may be tabulated as follows : (a) To make good demolitions and losses from the encroach-ment of industrial and commercial areas, less the additions to housing accommodation resulting from the conversion of large houses into flats   ... ...       100,000(b) Slum clearance schemes    ... ... ... ...      300,000(c) To restore the proportion of vacant premises to its pre-war figure ... ... ... ...   &apos;      ...      200,000(d) To diminish overcrowding especially among sharingfamilies ... ....... ... ...       300,000
of older people who would probably prefer to live by themselves, by the provision of various kinds of state pensions. The number of families as defined in the census is thus an elastic factor, capable of considerable expansion. But there is clearly a limit to this expansion, and though it is difficult to measure it with any precision, we doubt, however, whether this factor by itself could in any circumstances increase the demand for houses by as much as 10 per cent, above the pre-war standard. Yet if the present rate of house building is maintained, by 1938, not only will this position be reached, but the normal number of vacant premises will also have been restored, and enough houses been built to replace those demolished under the slum clearance schemes.23. In these circumstances it is extremely unlikely that the building of new houses can possibly continue at its present rate for as long as three years, and indeed we should expect that there will be a substantial decline in building activity in many areas before the end of 1936 and that this will have become general before the end of 1937. Moreover the decline, when it sets in, will be very considerable. House building might easily be reduced from its present level of 330,000 a year, to a level at which it no more than satisfies the demand for houses to supply the needs of the natural increase in private families and to replace normal demolition, i.e.,to a level of approximately 90,000 houses a year. In terms of employment, there might be a falling off in the demand for labour, direct or indirectly employed in the building industry, of the order of half a million men. To some extent it may be possible to mitigate this decline by further developments of housing policy, a question to which we revert later in this report (paragraph 45).24. In considering the significance of this figure, it must be borne in mind that an adverse movement in foreign trade which had the effect of reducing employment, at its worst by 600,000 men, was responsible for the unprecedented slump of 1929-32. Thus there is a grave danger that in 1937 or thereabouts this country may be faced with a crisis of the same magnitude as the last, but with one serious disadvantage in addition, namely, the saturation of that field of demand, which is most quickly responsive to a reduction in the rate of interest. In the final sections of this report we turn to consider the methods by which this prospective crisis may be best overcome, and the steps which it will be necessary to take in the meantime to insure that this country is in a position to take them.YI. Overseas trade.25. British export trade has shown a quite considerable improvement since the bottom of the depression, and the volume of competitive imports which have been received into this country has expanded by only a moderate amount since the imposition of the tariff. Thus, the net employment in foreign trade has expanded since 1932 in proportion with the expansion of total employment. But the character of our export trade has undergone certain modifications. In the first place, there has been a change in the importance of different markets. This is. illustrated by the following table :-*Table 7.The direction of British exports in the first quarter of the years 1929, 1932,and 1935.	1929.		1932.		1935.		 000&apos;s.

Exports to British countries, and to countries within the sterling area, have expanded considerably since 1932, whereas exports to other foreign countries have remained stationary. In part this must be attributed to the advantageous agreements which it has been possible to conclude.with the countries of the first two groups, particularly with Denmark and the Argentine. But other factors of great importance in stimulating this trade have been the close financial co-operation between these countries and ourselves, and the diffusion of the benefits of cheap money throughout the sterling area.27. In addition to this change in the direction of trade, a further important change appears to be taking place in the character of the goods we export. The export of capital goods is apparently becoming more important and the export of goods for consumption less important. Normally speaking, the export of capital goods can be expected to decline more than other classes of goods in times -of depression, and to expand more than other classes of goods in times of recovery. For depression is always most severe in the market for capital goods. The last depression, however, was marked by particularly heavy losses of markets by the textile manufacturing industries, partly as a result of Japanese competition, but mainly as a result of the increasing development of these industries in our overseas markets. As a consequence, the relative importance of exports of capital goods was maintained in the first two years of the depression and only showed a comparatively small decline in the years 1932 and 1933. In 1934 capital goods had practically regained the same relative importance as they held in 1929, and in 1935 we have seen a much more rapid expansion in their export than in the export of goods for current consumption. The following tables illustrate this point.Table 8.
exports of vehicles and ships in that year, goods which had no doubt been ordered in the year 1929 or earlier, but which, owing to their long period of construction, were only delivered after the slump had begun.28. &quot;We may further inquire in what quarters the export of British capital goods is expanding most rapidly. The following table indicates that again it is the British countries and, as far as it is possible to judge, the foreign countries of the sterling area which are responsible for the greater part of the increase; though it also appears that even in other foreign countries an expansion is taking place.Table 10.Exports of British capital goods in the years 1929 to 1935.	1929.	1930.	1931.	1932.	1933.	1934.	1935*.British countries.

Judged in the light of the tendencies which have made themselves apparent in the last few years, we may conclude that the prospects of British exporting industries are to-day more dependent than hitherto on the course of recovery within the British Empire and the foreign countries belonging to the sterling area than before the slump; and that the export of capital goods is gaining in importance relatively to the export of goods for current consumption. We do not believe that these tendencies will prove transitory. On the one hand, financial considerations and general policy are likely to maintain the economic interdependence of the members of the British Empire and other nations of the sterling group. On the other hand, the trend of policy in the overseas countries, will no doubt continue to be in the direction of greater industrialisation; and in that event, though they will cease to be such convenient markets for our textiles, clothing, and the like, they should be able to absorb increasing quantities of the-products of our iron and steel and engineering industries.30. In one respect the present condition of the Overseas Empire is just the reverse of that in Great Britain. The outstanding feature of the economic life of the raw material producing countries of the Empire is still the great reduction in internal purchasing power that has followed the decline in the prices of their exports relative to those of their imports. This has affected not only the volume of their imports, but also the volume of production of their own industries, where they exist. In Australia, for example, employment among trades unionists, which in 1929 amounted to nearly 400,000, fell below 300,000 during 1932, and is still less than 350,000. In cases where exports largely consist of foodstuffs-for the United Kingdom market, their volume has shown a substantial increase; but where they consist of raw materials and are dependent on the volume of world industrial production, they are generally well below the 1929 level. In general, the degree of prosperity prevailing throughout the Empire remains lower-than before the depression, though the rise which has occurred in raw material-

The principal effects of the decline in food and raw material prices on the economic life of the Dominions were: first, the fact that the existing structure of internal indebtedness weighed with unlooked for severity upon those engaged in primary production; secondly, the difficulties that arose in the raising of further loans in the London market brought to an abrupt close the programmes of government financed expenditure on development; thirdly, the purchasing power available in the internal market was very seriously reduced, with disastrous repercussions on the development of manufacturing industry. These difficulties have, in most cases, by now been mastered. The weight of debt was attacked in many ways. In Australia and New Zealand the position of agricultural debtors was eased by the devaluation of the currency to 80 per cent, of its previous sterling value. In Australia, there was also the part voluntary, part compulsory, scaling down of interest charges in 1931. In New Zealand mortgage interest rates, were [11926] dprices, expressed in sterling, and in the price of gold since the beginning of 1932, has been great enough to eliminate the worst of the difficulties encountered during the slump.31. This generalisation, however, does not apply to South Africa, the price of whose principal product, gold, has risen far above that of 1929. In her case industry and agriculture are benefiting from the increased internal demand;. foreign capital is freely available for development; and a substantial boom in house building appears to be proceeding.32. Though all parts of the Empire are equally interested in the sterling prices of raw materials, their degree of economic development is in other respects extremely different. The Colonial Empire is almost entirely without manu-facturing industries, and its demand for manufactured imports thus bears a simple relation to the prices it obtains for its exports. Apart from this all-important factor, the prospects of colonial trade are influenced by (i) the accumulation of unsold stocks of manufactured goods within each colony; and (ii) the degree of development expenditure undertaken by the colonial administra-tions. Over the years 1930-1933 imports into the colonies considerably exceeded the value of their exports, and though this excess was no doubt in part financed by drawing on accumulated funds in London, in part it took the form of the piling up of stocks in the colonies. The more satisfactory experience of 1934 appears to have had the effect of reducing these supplies, and the outlook for exporters to the Colonial Empire is so much the more favourable. Capital development in the Colonial Empire is largely dependent on the needs of the local exporting industries; and though the financial position of colonial administra-tions has improved enormously as the result of the rise of stock prices in London, no very great extension of development can be expected until international trade in raw materials has regained and surpassed the 1929 level.33. The Dominions present a far more complicated picture. Their financial organisation is much more elaborate; their economic interests are much more diverse. In every case there is a substantial manufacturing interest which it is the declared policy of every Dominion Government to foster, and which in fact was expanding rapidly up to the year 1929. This development and the effect of the slump on it may be judged from the following figures of employment in manufacturing industry in the Dominions :  Table 11.Persons employed in manufacturing industry in certain British Dominions.(in thousands.)
scaled down to the capacity of the borrower to pay by the institution of a system of land courts. And in general the law took the unfortunate debtor under its protection. Financial conditions have now been very much eased throughout the Dominions, and a condition of great financial liquidity now prevails, at any rate in New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa, though in the case of the two former this has only been possible at the expense of slowing down the normal rate of expansion. House building, for example, has very greatly diminished in both these Dominions, though there has been a considerable recovery since 1932.35. Perhaps the most impressive instance of readjustment which the slump has seen is the disappearance of the Australian adverse balance of payments. The figures tell their own tale and deserve to be quoted.   They are as follows :  Table 12.The estimated Australian balance of payments.1928-29 1929-30 1930-31 1931-32 1932-33(thousands of  s. sterling.)Adverse balance. 41,661 71,616 15,6263/790Favourable balance.6,360When we recollect the profound changes in economic conditions which were required to produce an improvement of  100 millions in the British balance of payments, the extent of this achievement in a population of less than a sixth of our numbers can be properly appreciated.36. Since 1931 Australia has been forced to finance her development out of her own resources, and it has only been possible to effect this as a result of the very small demand there has been in every field of investment activity. The gradual improvement in conditions since 1932 is, however, increasing the demand for capital, and since the beginning of this year interest rates have been rising. It is now again cheaper for the Australian government to&apos; borrow in London rather than internally, and if the Australian recovery is to proceed, it is very probable that such borrowing will be necessary.37. It also seems likely that the gradual expansion in domestic demand will carry manufacturing industry in the Dominions back to the level of 1929. We have already seen that there has been a considerable revival in the demand for capital goods, especially for machinery, from the Dominions, though, except in the case of South Africa, this still is a long way below the level of 1929. In considering the future prospects of demand from this quarter, we must bear in mind the very great readjustments which there have been in relative manufac-turing costs in Great Britain and the Dominions since 1929. In Australia, for example, average wages* have been reduced from 101s. 2d. in 1929 to 81s. lOd. in September 1934, a reduction of 20 per cent. In Great Britain wages have fallen by less than 5 per cent. Moreover, the Australian pound has been devalued by 20 per cent, of its sterling value. As a consequence a large number of industries which in 1929 were only just able to maintain themselves with the help of the high Australian tariff must by now have become definitely competitive. It follows that any revival of internal Australian demand will be met to a large extent by increased production in Australia itself. Great Britain&apos;s trade will benefit only indirectly as a result of the increased demand for capital goods. But though in the long run this may be a factor tending to diminish Great Britain^ exports, in the short run it may have favourable results. For the value of the equipment of a factory is likely to exceed the value of its current output. This tendency is likely to be true, though in a less degree, in other Dominions besides Australia.* Adult males only.
38. The broad result of this examination of the position within the British Empire is that there is a good prospect of a continued improvement in British export trade in that direction, but that this improvement so far as the Dominions are concerned is likely to be largely confined to the products of the engineering and iron and steel trades. That is to say, we expect to see in the future a continuation of the trends which we have already observed in our exports during the last few years.39. We are interested in the Empire not merely as traders, but as bankers as well. The stability of sterling and the maintenance of low money rates can be materially affected by events and policy in Australia, South Africa, and elsewhere. This, indeed, is one of the major lessons of the last depression. It was not so much the fact that Great Britain had by that time developed a serious adverse balance of payments which led to the exchange crisis of 1931. Far more important was the cumulative effect of many years of borrowing by the Empire as a whole. The effect of the return to the gold standard on the British balance of trade was not very great. The effect on the balance of trade of the whole Empire was much greater. The following table shows the balance of trade between British countries and foreign countries on the one hand, and of Great Britain with all countries, British and foreign, on the other.  ,Table 13.The adverse balance of commodity trade of the British Empire and of the UnitedKingdom in the years 1924 to 1933.(  millions.)	1924.	1925.	1926.	1927.	1928.	1929.	1930.	-1931.	1932.	1933.Adverse balance of com-										commodity trade between										British countries and										foreign countries	193	160	374	341	301	367	403	378	226	175Adverse balance of com-										commodity   trade  of  the										United Kingdom	337	393	463	386	352	382	386	.  407	286	258Throughout the period of 1927-29 Great Britain considered in isolation had a favourable balance of payments large enough to meet the loans for abroad raised in the London market. But it is highly probable that the Empire as a whole was becoming increasingly indebted to foreign countries.YII. The outlook for the next few years.40. So far as the immediate prospects are concerned, the conclusions to which we have come in the foregoing examination of the economic outlook are on the whole reassuring. There is room, we believe, for further expansion in the investment industries. Shipbuilding, for example, improvement of which is long overdue, shows signs of increased activity. Our exports should continue to increase. We should also expect to see a continued increase in demand in the home market for goods and services for current consumption. This, however, may be at a diminishing rate, especially as the rate of production for this market may be adversely affected by the fact that hitherto it has been stimulated by the rapid increase in the demand for working capital which is normally associated with a period of recovery. As the rate of recovery slows down, the effect of this favourable factor will pro tantp diminish. Though it is perhaps unwise to commit ourselves to a numerical estimate, our impression is that employment among insured persons within the age groups 16 to 64, might expand through these causes by not more at the outside than 250,000 persons a year, and that only so long as house building shows no serious recession. Though this is a comparatively high rate of increase judged by [11926]   &quot; &apos; e
historical precedents, it must be observed that it will not be great enough to effect any substantial diminution in the numbers of the unemployed. During the next few years the numbers of persons over 16 years of age needing employment will expand very rapidly, because in these years the abnormally large numbers of children born just after the war will be reaching the age of 16.41. As regards the prospects for a longer period, however, our conclusions are less favourable. The whole fabric of our present prosperity is threatened by the likelihood of a decline culminating possibly in a virtual collapse of activity in the construction of new dwelling houses. Other forces of expansion may be strong enough to maintain or even slightly to increase the level of general activity for a little time after a recession in house building begins. If the recession in house building were to culminate in a collapse, it would be such an important factor making for a contraction of trade, that a major depression would be almost bound to accompany it. We may predict with confidence that before the end of 1938 Great Britain will again be faced with the problem of dealing with an apparently inevitable increase in unemployment.42. Whether or not this country is in a position to deal satisfactorily with the new crisis when it develops will depend in a large degree on the policy pursued in the intervening years. The only satisfactory compensation for such a serious decline in the level of home investment as must, failing any large extension in the field of public capital development, be associated with the prospective falling off in house building would be an expansion in one of the two other main forms of economic activity, namely, production for consumption in the home market, and production for export. The first will require a major redistribution of the use of incomes as between saving and spending. The second will largely depend on events outside the control of this country, but it will be possible to promote it by a liberal commercial policy, and, so long as sterling retains its independent position as an international currency, it may be possible to assist it by appropriate financial measures.43. Thus the situation which will arise when the next crisis occurs will continue to call for at least as rigorous an insistence on the policy of making money cheap in times of depression as was necessary in 1932. It is therefore essential that the general financial position of Great Britain at that time shall be such as to make the application of this policy possible. This must be fully borne in mind in considering any change in Britain&apos;s monetary policy. It would be disastrous if the free development of Britain&apos;s monetary policy were to be hampered by exchange difficulties such as we experienced in 1930 and 1931. It would also be highly unfortunate if Great Britain&apos;s national finances were to be in a suspect condition when the need for possibly rather unorthodox remedies makes itself felt. Great Britain, in 1938, must not find itself in the same difficulties as in 1930.44. In this connection an important point of policy arises with regard to a possible stabilisation of the pound in relation to the dollar and the franc. If in 1938 there should be no rigid link between the pound and these currencies, and if sterling remained the international currency of a group of countries prepared to accept Britain&apos;s financial leadership with confidence, it would be possible to pursue a policy of cheap money, even though only small reserves of other currencies were available. If, however, by that time the pound were rigidly linked with gold, Great Britain would need to be in a position to lose considerable quantities of gold and foreign assets in the pursuit of its policy. We do not propose to pursue this part of the subject, as this would lead to a discussion of the larger question of the conditions necessary for stabilisation, with which we are not concerned in this report.45. A final word must be said regarding the policy to be pursued by the government with the object of directly stimulating large schemes of home investment. The effectiveness of such intervention on the volume of employment depends very largely on the economic conditions prevailing at the time when they begin to affect the demand for labour. If this occurs at a time when the capital producing industries are fairly fully employed, the net effect on government investment on employment in the investment industries may be very much less than the numbers actually employed on the government scheme. If, however, the demand is felt at a time when investment in general is depressed, it should have
important repercussions, not only in those industries, but also in the industries supplying consumers&apos; goods. In considering important schemes for home investment, preference should be given to those which will mature in the years 1938, 1939 and 1940. This principle is of special force in the field of housing policy. It would not be appropriate to stimulate the housing activities of local authorities at the present time, when house building is being carried on under private enterprise to an extent which cannot be maintained for long. On the other hand, it will afford considerable relief to the building industry if in the period of comparative depression that must inevitably follow the present boom local authorities are in a position to undertake a substantial programme of slum clearance and of providing houses for those classes of the population which are not in a position to pay the rents now demanded for houses built by private enterprise. Although, however, the time for action has not yet arrived, it is highly desirable that the necessary steps should now be taken to make possible the immediate application of this policy as soon as the depression makes itself felt.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.
