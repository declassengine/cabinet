Hankey, G .0 .B .,G .0 .M.G .,e .0 .V .0 Secretary to the Cabinet.This Meeting was held in order to enable the Minister for League of Nations Affairs to report the results of the recent Meeting of the Council of the League of Nations at Geneva to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and for the three Ministers to confer on the line to be taken by the Minister for League of Nations Affairs at the forthcoming Meetings of the three Powers signatories to the Abyssinian Treaty of 1906,
The Minister for League of Nations Affairs reported that at Geneva the French representatives had acted, markedly in line with the British.   This applied especially to M. Leger.It was noted that, this development was in conformity with the wishes of the Cabinet (Cabinet 40 (35),  Conclusion 1).Ministers were informed that the probable course of events next week would be Anglo-French Conversations for a, day or two   after which the tripartite discus-sions would begin.In the course of the discussion reference was made to an interim Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on the military implications of the appli-cation of Article XVI of the Covenant of the League of Nations  (0.0.5.-388) which had been sent to the Ministers present pending the working out of details, which was still In progress.The attitude to be adopted by the Minister for League of Nations Affairs at the forthcoming Meetings, and certain other matters arising consequentially, were discussed , and Conclusions were reached which may be summarised as follows:-(a) That the Minister for League of Nations Affairs should do his utmost to maintain the close relations already established with the French Government on the It a J o--Abyss inlan dis put e:(b) That In the preliminary conversations with the French Government his aim should be to establish a. programme for later discussion with the Italian representative. This programme would probably have to be drawn in such manner as to bring home to the Italian representative that the ultimate choice before Italy lay between the following alternatives:-(i) Acceptance from&apos;Abyssinia of certain concessions on points in the Italian case which His Majesty1s Government have already told the British Ambassador in Rome (who did not have occasion to use them.)  that they could support, if the case was made out, viz
&quot;(l) in so far as threats to,  or violations of, the Italian frontiers are concerned.:(2) In respect, of aggressions such as Walwal affray if proved against Abyssinia to our satisfaction and that of the League of Nations:(s)  in respect of breaches - if proven - of treaties between Italy an-&apos; Abyssinia. Further(4) in a general way His Mages by&apos;s Government would be willing to support&quot; Italy in pressing Abyssinia, to permit to Italians and. other foreigners the usual and reason-able facilities for trade, habitation etc. with regard to which she has been obstructive in the past:(.5) as regards slavery His Ma.iestyTs Govern-roent could support insistence on Abyss inia putting into force such future mess tires as the League may think necessary and remedying past failures to carry out her obligations in this mat t er. &quot;(melegram to Rome Mo .565, of July 19th.)It was foreseen, however, that there was no prospect of so limited a programme sufficing to bring Italy to an accommodation.    mhe indications were that the French Government would propose to   apply joint suasion at Addis Ababa with a view to extracting a maximum offer from Abyssinia.    It was also pointed out that the more attractive the offer to be induced, the better would be the prospects of the first course and the less the prospect of having to consider the alternative course below.   Possibly the French Government might have other additions to suggest, and the Minister for League of Nations Affairs might, at his discretion, remind them that they had. never made any concession to Italy comparable with the British cession of Jubaland .ORf ii) The carrying out by the League of Nations of the procedure laid down in the Covenant, including,  in the last resort,  consideration by the members of the League of their obliga-t ions thereuhder .In any reference to this latter aspect the Minister for League of Nations Affairs should be guided by the approval given by the Cabinet to the lines suggested by the Secretary of State for Foreign -Affairs  on Wednesday,  July 24th, where he ind 1 -cated that in discussions with the French&quot;the underlying assumption would be that both Powers realised their obligations and were jointly interested to find a way out of the difficulty&quot;.
The Minister for League of Nations Affairs would,  of course., be on his guard, against giving the French Government any opportunity-nity to suggest to Italy that we were pressing them to commit themselves to sanctions.   Any detailed discussion of sanctions should be avoided, as this does not arise at present and,  if it arises at all, belongs rather to discus-sions at a later&apos;stage.c) That the Minister for League of Nations Affaire who would be accompanied, by the Permanent Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in Paris, should, as  far as possible, keep in touch with the Prime Minister, who would, be in France at the time of the Meetings, and in particular should arrange to report the position verbally to him after the conclusion of the Meetings, in order that he might decide whether, and when,  to summon a Meeting of the Cabinet.    It appeared probable to the Ministers present that if the Paris Meetings did not produce a satisfactory result, a Meeting of the Cabinet would, be required before the end of August, when important decisions might be necessary .Lake, Tsana .d) That if the three-Power Conference should not achieve a satisfactory result, the question of Lake Tsana would become important, and the Minister for League of Nations Affairs should have discretion to warn the Italian representative that this was an important British interest.    He might repeat the warning given by Sir Edward. Grey (afterwards Earl Grey of Fallodon) in 19IS:&quot;e) That in the meantime the Foreign Office-should examine the question of Lake Tsana in its political and technical aspects    and consult the Defence Departments on any aspectsof the question which might concern them: Defence Aspects.f) That the Secretary to the Cabinet and Committee of Imperial Defence should, inform the Chiefsof Staff Sub-Committee that the Prime Minister would be glad if they would consider the following questions(l) At once to examine the question of what the position would be if Italy took the bit between her teeth:(S) On the assumption that the contingency referred to in 1.1) might take place, are there any steps that oiight to be taken at once to provide against it?In this latter connection the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the Foreign Office would have no objection to
any relatively quiet steps being taken, such as,  for example, the raising of the anti-aircraft defences of Malta to the approved scale.    They would not even object if the movement of anti-aircraft guns b ecame publie.Whitehall Gardens, s .W .1, August 6,  19 35.
