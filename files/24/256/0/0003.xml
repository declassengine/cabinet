This document is the property, of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.CABINET.EDUCATIONAL POLICY COMMITTEE. COMPULSORY EDUCATION BEYOND 14.MEMORANDUM BY.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION.1,      It will he remembered that in February 1934 Lord Halifax submitted a memorandum on future educational policy (CoP.37 (34))  and that a Cabinet Committee was set up to consider educational policy on that basis (Cabinet 5 (34) Conclusion 5).      The Committee presented its first report (C.P. 32 (35)) on February 1st, 1935, and this was approved by the Cabinet on February 6th, 1935, (Cabinet 8 (35) Conclusion 9).      In accordance with the Cabinet decision Lord Halifax subsequently held confidential consultations with the Interests involved,      I have been Informed of the upshot of those consultations, and now submit the conclusions which I have reached after consultation with my departmental advisers.2.      It has for some time been apparent that there is uncertainty and some measure of discontent in some quarters as regards the Government1a educational policy.     The last great educational advance,  that of 1918, with its development in the Hadow Report of 1924 and the subsequent widespread adoption of the system of reorganisation on Hadow lines for Public Elementary Schools, has been consolidated,  and there is a general feeling that the ground is now ready for a further move forward.      The aspect of this feeling which hasSecret.E(34) (6) .Copy No.Present Position:Demand for Educational Advance.
been most conspicuous has been the demand for tthe raising of the school leaving age.     Educationally, it is urged that this would complete the general scheme of Hadow reorganisation by ensuring that the cider Elementary School children shall have a full four years&apos; course in the reorganised schools.      It is also supported for other reasons.     Under the stress of increased International competition, and of the general financial and economic difficulties, a demand has been growing for some further educational training of adolescents which should serve to improve the character and equipment of the new recruits to industry.     On the economic side action has been demanded as a means of reducing the burden of unemployment by with-drawing one whole age group from the labour market.3.      This agitation culminated in the deputation from the School Leaving Age Council, headed by Colonel John Buchan, to the Prime Minister on February 21st, 1935.      The Prime Minister then expressed himself as much impressed by the arguments of the deputation, and promised that the Government would consider afresh the various possible solutions of the problem.      In accordance with that promise, and with the views expressed by the Cabinet, confidential discussions were entered into with the various interests involved,-Building Grants for Voluntary Schools.4.     One of the primary points considered in these discussions has naturally been the part to be played by building the Voluntary Schools in any raising of the school leavinggrants notpssible for age. It has been made abundantly clear that, unless they  e organ! sa-tion alone.      could be assisted by building grants,  the denominations would not be able to play their proper part.      It would
not, however, Toe possible, with.....anything like general assent, to obtain buiIdin/;;, grants for purposes of reorganisation alone.      They would only be generally accepted if given in connexion with some form of raising of the school leaving age also.      In the first place, theFree Churches, while they have indicated both by resolutionsat the recent General Assembly and in discussion that theywould be prepared to accept the principle of buildinggrants as an emergency measure to meet the demand for freshaccommodation necessitated by the raising of the age,would strongly oppose such grants for the sole purpose of reorganisation.     Building, grants given for this limitedpurpose would inevitably involve a demand for furthergrants of the same kind when the age was raised, and this procedure, besides embittering the Free Churches, wouldmean taking two bites at the cherry.Four main alternative proposals for continuing compulsory education.5c      There have been four main alternative proposalscanvassed in the press and in educational discussions:(i)    A flat raising of the age from 14 to 15, without exemptions and with maintenance allowances;This is the simplest and most widely supported form.(ii)    A raising of the age from 14 to 15, with exemptions for beneficial employment;(iii)    A raising of the age from 14 to 15, withexemptions for beneficial employment and a requirement that the exempted children should attend for,  say, the equivalent of one day a Y/eek at Day Continuation Classes up to the age of 16;(iv)    The retention of the present leaving agesupplemented by compulsory attendance at Day Continuation Schools from 14 to 16 or even 18;This is virtually a revival of the Day Continuation Classesof the Fisher Act of 1918.
6* It may be convenient to deal first with the two ter proposals, which I shall propose to reject for the sons set out below:(a) Proposal (iii) has certain educational attractions.      It bridges the gap between full time schooling and full time employment, and secures a rough equivalence between the measure of education enjoyed by. those who secure exemption and those who do not.      I find however that it receives no support,  either from Local Authorities or from employers generally.      The Authorities dislike it on two main grounds: first, the administrative difficulty of making Day Continuation School, provision for an uncertain number of children:;    and, secondly,the disproportionate expense which such provision would entail in the more sparsely populated districts.      Employers dislike it on account of the disorganisation in their works arrangements resulting from periodic absences of their young employees, and also because the small employer would find the scheme virtually unworkable, and would therefore be unable to recruit labour between the ages of 14 and 15.      I am clear therefore that we cannot contemplate any mandatory provisions as to the part-time instruction of exempted children:    the possibility of empowering Authorities to make such a require-ment is referred to in paragraph 13.(b) The Day Continuation School solution (iv) has the support of several enlightened employers who are heads of large firms.      I have, however, been unable to find any support for it in any other quarter.      It is regarded as expensive and administratively difficult by the Local Education Authorities, and even the largest employers generally complain that it would have a seriously disorganising effect  on the labour arrangements in their ?/orks, besides adding appreciably to their working costs.      When it is remembered that a very large proportion of employers, both in Industry and in the retail trades,  do not employ more than 25 workers,  the practical difficulties of this solution and the embarrass-ments which it would inflict, on industry generally will be realised.7.      I have, therefore, been driven back to the.sideration of the first two proposals set out inagraph 5.      Before considering them, however,  I should it clear that whichever is adopted I am advised that
an interval of not less than two or three years would be necessary between the passing of legislation and the Appointed Day,  in order to allow Local Authorities and the Managers of Voluntary Schools time for the necessary negotiations and subsequently for the actual preparation and building.      This means that any scheme would, probably not come into operation before 1939 or 1940, by which time the number of children in the age group from 14 to 15 would be approaching stability. Proposal 8.      It is quite clear from the discussions whichhave taken place that there is a strong trend of opinion -educational and other - in favour of the first solution -raising the age of 15 without exemptions.      If money were no object, I should not improbably, in spite of the objections that may be taken to it, have felt bound to recommend this course.9.      It is impossible, however,  to resist the conclusion, with which all the advocates of this proposal agree,  that on economic and political grounds it would necessitate the giving of maintenance allowances to the children thus compulsorily attending school for an extra year, and that these maintenance allowances could not well be on a scale lower than the 5/- a week proposed by Sir Charles Trevelyan in the Labpur Party&apos;s Bill of 1930, or be based on income limits for the parents lower than those which he then suggested.10.      If such allowances were to be given,  the cost to the Exchequer on the Trevelyan scale, with the Trevelyan limits, would be at least  2,500,000 a year for England and Wales
13alone (though under the Trevelyan proposals the exchequer would have &quot;borne a larger amount than this).     Serious as theannual payment of this sum (which, it must he rememberedjwould be for a non effective service) might be to theExchequer, the addition of an equal sum to the budgets ofLocal Authorities would be an unwelcome addition to their obligations.     Indeed, the advocacy of maintenance allowances by Local Authorities is usually qualified by a declaration thatthe Exchequer should bear the whole cost.11.     Moreover, the additional annual cost (includingScotland) of the whole proposal would thus be of the order of 9,500,000 of which  5,500,000 would fall on the Exchequer and 4,000,000 upon local funds.      This means that in the distressed areas the cost of the whole proposal would often bethe equivalent of a l/- rate, which would certainly cause ademand for further relief from the Government, and even in themore prosperous districts it would place a serious additional burden upon industry.litical 12.     Among a certain proportion of the Government&apos;slectionssupporters the principle of maintenance allowances during anyintenancelowances. period of compulsory education is regarded with hostility.Furthermore, the introduction of maintenance allowances would mean the introduction into politics of a new bargaining counter, in using which the various parties would inevitably be tempted to overbid each other for popular support;    the existence of 5/- a week might soon mean the promise of 7/6 a week.    In any case the additional cost involved in granting these allowances would absorb a sum which could not be regarded as serving any direct educational purpose, whereas for a fraction of that sum
very substantial educational progress, as I hope to show below, could be secured in directions where there is a popular as well as instructed demand for advance. Proposal 13.      If, therefore, on financial or other grounds therope ii) i therefore    Cabinet should decide that this alternative is undesirable,suggested for I suggest that the proper method of dealing with the problemadoption.would be to adopt the second alternative and to raise the school leaving age to 15 with exemptions for beneficial employment.      Although for the reasons which I have given I feel bound to reject the proposal that a duty should be placed on Local Authorities to provide instruction at Day Continuation Classes for children exempted from school attendance between 14 and 15, and a corresponding duty placed on the exempted children to attend such classes, yet I think there is something to be said both on educational and political grounds for empowering Authorities in granting exemptions to attach thereto such conditions as they think fit as to the further education, instruction and vocational training of the exempted children up to the age of 16.      I should not anticipate that many, if indeed any, Authorities would have recourse to this power in the earlier years after the Act comes into operation, but it might well be that experience of the working of a system of exemptions might lead some of them to do so later on.      There is a precedent in the Education (Scotland) Act,  1908, for attaching to exemption from school attendance conditions as to further part time instruction up to the age of 16.14.      The total annual cost of this proposal (including Scotland) is estimated at rather less than  2,500,000 of which rather more than  1,500,000 would fall on the Exchequer. I must add a warning that it is unlikely that this proposal would get a good press.      Its popularity would rather be among
ff (1&quot;*&apos;4^the less vocal but electorally more important sections of the community, such as working-class parents and employers of labour, v/ho- would quickly voice their disapproval if presented with the alternative policy, by which no  exemptions were allowed.15.      I should also add that the adoption of this alternative would not automatically dispose of the question of maintenance allowances owing to the precedent of Caernarvonshire, to which Mr. Lloyd George referred when he appeared before the General Purposes Committee of the Cabinet on May 30th last.      It is  true,  as he then pointed out, that maintenance allowances are given in that county to children between 14 and 15,  though the school leaving age has been raised to 15 by bye-law, and that the expenditure is recognised fox- grant by the Board.      It must, however, be remembered that the decision to pay grant was given by Lord Eustace Percy in 1927, when the bye-law procedure was still novel.      Since that date the Board have -uniformly refused to recognise for grant any expenditure on maintenance allowances whi ch was not intended to assist the pupil to pursue a suitable course of instruction for a suitable and definite period beyond the school leaving age in the area.    Moreover, the Caernarvonshire allowances are very strictly, indeed penuriously, administered. They amount to 3/- a week and are given on a very severe income limit, about 50 per cent, lower than the Treveiyan scale.      If we were to adopt a similar scale, we should not begin to satisfy the parents whose children -were refused exemption and should merely be giving the Labour Party the opportunity to overbid us by repeating their previous offer.      In these circumstances I think that we
should, not allow the single and. anomalous instance of Caernarvonshire to govern our policy for the country as a whole, and that that policy should be that grant will not be paid on expenditure incurred by Local Education Authorities on maintenance allowances to pupils below the new leaving age of I 5.16.        If it were made clear that the first alternative was unacceptable to the Government on the ground that it was only by dropping maintenance allowances that we should be enabled to initiate other educational reforms which we regard as indispensable, but which we could not hope to carry out if our available funds were absorbed by the expenditure on maintenance allowances, I should be reasonably confident that the alternative which I have outlined above would be accepted by public opinion generally.      It would then be presented,  together with the other proposals mentioned in paragraph 26 below, as a comprehensive policy covering the whole field of education, and we should be able to claim that so far from &quot;starving&quot; education, we were spending money on more directly educational objects, and therefore, more prudently.17.      At the same time, although I put forv/ard the proposal on the primary ground that it has the advantage of rendering maintenance allowances unnecessary, it can also be advocated for educational reasons as being a development of the existing system,  (i.e.,  of raising the school leaving age by bye-lav/ which, under the present Education Act, involves the giving of exemptions), and so, therefore,  in accordance with the general English tradition of progressing gradually on the lines of existing administration.      The adoption of the proposal would also reduce the capital
expenditure required by Local Authorities in providing the necessary accommodation, since it would not involvebuilding for the whole of the age group in question,owing to the fact that a considerable number of children would obtain exemptions, especially in areas where juvenileemployment was good.Reacti^oiis 18.      The probable reactions on the principalof tIll proposal.        interests involved may be summarised as follows:-Local (a)      The Local Authorities will not view the principleAuthorities.* ...........      of exemptions with favour.      They express themselves asapprehensive that it will not secure that the children who would most benefit by the additional year of school life are retained in the schools.      They also urge  on educational grounds, not indeed without some reason, that the release of the exempted children will tend to. break up the courses of instruction planned for the additional year,  leaving only dwindling and therefore expensive classes at the top of the senior schools.     Much of their opposition would, however, in fact be based on the labour involved in local administration of exemptions, and on the fear of local odium in the task of endeavouring  to   secure a fair- and consistent application of the principle.Par ents. (b)      Parents generally, especially in areas whereemployment is good, will be in favour of the scheme when they discover that their children are not to be debarred from accepting the offer of a good job which would at once start them on a wage-earning career and bring some needed help to the family budget.Employers. (c)      Employers generally will be in favour of theproposal as mitigating the interference with their present recruitment of juvenile labour,  which is bound to arise
from any raising of the school leaving age, i-ricul Jurists . (d)      The agricultural interest would warmly supportthe scheme.      The giving of exemptions is the one condition on which farmers would he prepared to consider the raising of the age, eachers. (e)      The teachers would prefer the flat raising ofthe age.      They have expressed themselves in favour of that solution on educational grounds.      It also  carries with it the maximum advantages to the teaching profession. They have, however, indicated that they would he prepared to accept some such solution as that which I have proposed if they cannot get the alternative which they would prefer.ducationis ts . ( f)      Educationists also would prefer the flatraising of the age.      It is more symmetrical and has the advantage of heing the obvious solution which has held the field for several years, having in fact become an article of faith, which is accepted without undue scrutiny.      They might, however, be placated by assurances as to the methods proposed to secure that exemptions should be given for beneficial employment and by the other educational advances proposed in paragraph 26. oliticians. (g)      The Labour Party and the Opposition Liberalsare already committed to the flat raising of the age and would, therefore,  oppose the suggested solution on principle.      The supporters of the Government would probably be pleased at the prospect of avoiding maintenance alloy/ances and would tend to be influenced by the favourable reactions of parents and employers, who form, the bulk of the electorate.
Economic 19.      On the economic side the proposal will makeand3o&quot;cIal no direct contributions towards relieving the problem of&quot;effects1.unemployment.      On the other hand, there are certain steps that we can take which will enable us to secure some counterbalancing social advantages, and thus to conciliate the opposition of that section of opinion which advocates the flat raising of the school leaving age on social rather than educational grounds.      I should contemplate that we should lay on Local Education Authorities the statutory duty of only giving exemptions after consultation with the existing local committees for dealing with juvenile employment, whether they are under the Local Authority or the Ministry of Labour.      We can also emphasise the desirability of taking into close consideration the existing school and medical records of children seeking exemption.      In this way we shall do something to direct the activities of the existing machinery towards securing that exempted children should only be released for employment which is both suitable to them and likely to offer prospects of permanence and advancement.Building Grants to Voluntary Schools. 20 *      I think that,  even with a system of exemptions, the raising of the school leaving age on the lines which I have advocated in paragraphs 15 to 19 would be generally regarded as justifying building grants to Voluntary Schools for reorganisation and raising the school leaving age.      Indeed, the resolution passed last April by the National Council of Free Churches specifically advocated the giving of exemptions for beneficial employment.
Trevelyan 21.     As regards Building Grants, I should propose to&apos;  Propo salsin 1930.        adopt, in the main, the scheme iorojjosed in connection withIpdifi cation.&apos;Sir Charles Trevelyan&apos;s abortive Bill of 1930,      Under that scheme(a) Power was given to Authorities to make grants, for purposes of reorganisation and of raising&apos;the school leaving age,  of not less than 50 per cent or more than 75 per cent of the cost of necessary improvements or reconditioning of existing voluntary schools.(b) The Managers&apos;  duty to keep the school house in repair was unaffected.(c) Teachers in schools thus aided were transferred to the employment of the Authority, who had the power&quot; of appointing and dismissing them.(d) A proportion, however, of the teachers, to be agreed in each case between the Authority and the Managers, were to be &quot;reserved&quot;, as having religious qualifications,  and were to be appointed by the Authority after the Managers were satisfied as to their fitness and competence to give the required religious instruction.(e) Provision was to be made for religious teaching on an agreed syllabus in cases where children were transferred from provided to voluntary schools, or where there was no effective choice of school. oposed 22,      I should, however, propose to make two importantjjie limit additions to those proposals.      The first is the impositionteg, grantspjd grants of a time limit for the grants.    This is introduced in order&quot; newghpols. to accentuate the emergency character of the grants and as a concession to the Non-conformist opposition.    The second is the extension of the grants to new schools.      In 1930, the
proposed grants were limited to existing schools.    Since that date, however, the process of reorganisation on the lines of the Hadow Report has made immense progress and it is generally realised that in very many cases not only the best educational solution, but also the most economical solution, is to be found in the building of new schools for senior children rather than in attempts to patch up an existing school so as to provide a makeshift type of accommodation for these older children.      This aspect of the problem has been further accentuated by the great progress in housing development during those years.      In new housing areas,   the building of new senior schools is a virtual necessity if the educational provision for the area is to be made on modern lines.      If, therefore, the Free Churches are offered the quid pro quo of a time limit on the grant, which also was not included in the Trevelyan proposals I should consider that the Government were justified in permitting the giving of such grants to new senior schools, although the actual wording of the formula will require great care.Mlding 23.      It was generally agreed at the recent discussionsjgantsto be that these building grants should be indirect, i.e. givenijidirec tand by the Local Authorities, and also voluntary, i6e.  theirfpluntary.giving should be a power of the Authority and not a duty imposed upon it.      Indirect grants would be consistent with the Board&apos;s present method of administering educational grants and v/ould also be considerably cheaper to the Exchequer, since they would involve, not the immediate disbursement of a capital sum, which would be required if the whole grant were given directly by the State, but only the payment of loan charges on, say, half the amount of capital expenditure incurred in this way by the Authorities.
The proposal that the grants should he voluntary on thepart of Authorities was accepted by the Denominations inthe 1930 discussions, although at that time it was quiteprobable that some Authorities might not be favourably disposed to applications for such grants.      It is clear,however,  from the discussions which have taken place, thatthere has been a considerable change in this res-pect, andthere now seem fair grounds for hoping that a reasonable attitude will be adopted, even in parts of Wales, where this feeling has always been strongest.ospect of 24.     Any scheme of this kind is always liable to beiacceptance.twice cursed, by him who gives and him who takes,  and for that reason I think that we need not be deterred from proceeding with these proposals, even if they met with some criticism from the parties concerned.      I should expect that such criticism would be based less on the demerits of the scheme than on unwillingness to abandon an established position.      I feel fairly confident that, generally speaking,  the parties to the discussion would be prepared to accept any reasonable scheme which was put forward by a National Government, provided that they did not have to take the responsibility for it.      I may recall also that the Trevelyan proposals secured general agreement at the time on the part of the Local Authorities,  the Church of England and the Roman Catholics and I believe that they would still be regarded by these three major parties to the discussion as a not unacceptable compromise.     Moreover,  the principle of these building grants has now been accepted by the Free Churches, whose opposition was the main factor in wrecking the negotiations of 1930.
General educational advance inevitable;    only to be obtained if combined with proposal set out inparagrapn .5 (ii).25.     As I indicated at the beginning of this memorandum, some further general educational development must be regarded as not only desirable but inevitable, and I believe that in present financial circumstances we can only formulate a comprehensive general policy of such development if we are relieved from the incubus of maintenance allowances. For this reason I suggest that the proposal to raise the school leaving age with exemptions and without maintenance allowances can be justified on the ground that education has not been starved by it but that the avoidance of maintenance allowances has enabled the Government to allocate an adequate sum to the other proposals which will round off such a policy and enable us to present it in a politically attractive form.Outline of general policy, proposed.26.      This policy should,  as I see it, cover the whole field of State aided education.     Beginning with the youngest children, we can secure at a relatively small annual cost a real development which should make a wide popular appeal.Igery Schools. (a)    We should encourage the provision of NurserySchools in those areas where the social conditionsrender them desirable and justifiable.-/sical (b)    We should promote an energetic development airing.of Physical Training, a subject which is attracting much general interest and in which we lag behind many Continental countries.     A comprehensive system of Physical Training, starting from the earlier years of school life, reaching its main development in the Senior schools for the great bulk of the children
between 11 and 15 years of age,  and simultaneously inthe Secondary and Technical schools for the olderadolescents,  should include the provision of classesfor those who have left school and for whose physical training and development the existing voluntary organisations,  even with the assistance which may be forthcoming from King George&apos;s Jubilee Trust,  cannotadequately provide.      The cost of this part of theprogramme need not be great,  since it will consist mainly of securing that the teachers are betterqualified to give such training, &quot;and the capitalexpenditure on such facilities as the provision ofgymnasia in Secondary or Senior schools, where thenumbers and circumstances render it desirable, can beestimated at a comparatively small sum.School Medical (c)    Concurrently with the two former proposalsServices.I am anxious to secure a general development of theSchool Medical Services.      This v/ould take the formprimarily of encouraging the expansion of the existing facilities in the way of providing school doctors andparticularly school dentists and also the extensionof remedial and preventive treatment in such ways asthe establishment of Orthopaedic and Open-Air schools for children in need of such treatment.Public Elementary (d)    As regards children in Public elementary schools.Schools,  the primary benefit will be reaped by the older children from the main proposal which I have set out above (paragraphs 13 - 19) for the raising of the school leaving age.      It will however by no means be confined to the children of 14 to 15 years of age. Its full effect cannot be secured unless the extra year of school life is to be taken in schools which
provide a continuous course of instruction from 11 to 15.      Such a basis for this main reform is being steadily built up by the continued progress of the Hadow reorganisation.      Some 55 per cent of the senior children in Public Elementary Schools are already in reorganised senior schools,  and by the time that, under my proposals,  the school leaving age would be raised,  it may be hoped that the process will be as nearly completed as physical factors permit.      The experience, moreover, of reorganised districts shows that the additional advantages secured by junior children when they are left in schools devoted to children of their own age are as important as those gained by the senior children, and it is not too much to say that the effects of this reorganisation are equally beneficial throughout the entire range of compulsory education.(e)    As regards young people who are receiving some form of Higher education and do not terminate their school life at 15,  I think that we should endeavour primarily to make Secondary Schools as accessible as possible to the ablest candidates irrespective of the means of their parents.      To this end, I would propose to remove altogether the present maximum limits attached to the award of &quot;special places&quot; tenable at such schools,  i.e. places which in cases of financial need carry total or partial exemption from tuition fees.      This maximum is normally 50 per cent of the previous year&apos;s admissions,  though higher limits, going up to 100 per cent, have been approved in some areas.It will be appreciated that the effect of
this proposal would, not he to impose on Local Authorities a uniform system under which all school places were treated as special places,    hut to give them complete discretion to award such a proportion of special places as they might think fit from the minimum percentage of 25 upwards.      In some areas, where the working class element largely predominates, a system of 100 per cent of special places might he regarded as best suited to local circumstances.      In other areas an appreciation of the fact that an admixture of children from better class homes raises the general tone of the school might lead the Authority to retain a proportion of places for fee-paying pupils.      In short,  I should expect that a system of local option, such as I have advocated, would, lead to the adoption in each area of such arrangements as might be best suited to its social and financial circumstances.      The financial effect of this proposal, depending as it does on the uncertain factors of what the several authorities might wish to do, and of what they might regard themselves as able to afford (for half of any additional cost would, fall upon the rates),  is virtually impossible to forecast.      But having regard to the various factors I have mentioned,  I should be surprised if the cost of this proposal to the Exchequer were more than  40,000 in the first full year of its operation, rising in the sixth year,  and thereafter,  to a sum of the order of  250,000.
state (f)    It is not enough, however,  to give theseSolio1 ar shij3S .ahler children a Secondary education only without an opportunity, in cases of real merit, for them to proceed to institutions of University standing,  and it would, I think, he morally wrong as well as politically inadvisable to debar them from the opportunity of such progress0      I should, therefore propose some increase in the number of State Scholarships at present awarded,  and at the same time to throw them open to all secondary schools instead of confining them as at present to those in receipt of grant aid,      I should also propose to raise the present limits of our assistance to State Scholars and to holders of other comparable scholar-ships,  in order to enable them to take their full share in the corporate life of the University or other institution.Scholarships (g)    I suggest that scholarships should befor DominionStudents at instituted,  tenable at Training Colleges for teachersTrainingColleges. in this country, for Dominion and Colonial scholars.In this I see an opportunity of doing something which is valuable in itself and will gain general political approval by securing a closer link with the Empire in the.case of the teaching profession than can be assured by the present sporadic system of interchange of teachers.      I should also like to complete it by the institution of a limited number of travelling scholarships for teachers in this country which would enable them to get first hand acquaintance with the appearance and problems of the Empire.
provision for (h)      I have been much impressed, by the extent toTechnicalEducation. which our provision for Technical education lagsbehind that which exists in many parts of Europe.    In many respects the facilities for and standards of such work are not only unworthy in themselves but definitely below the standard set by many of our competitors in international trade.      I am, therefore, instituting a general survey of the present situation, with the view not only of remedying the really bad conditions under which surprisingly good work is at present being done but also of developing proper  provision for Technical training in those areas where, owing to the shifting of industry, the existing facilities are not adequate to meet the demands of potential students and industry in general.(i)      Since 1931  there has been a &quot;standstill&quot; imposed on the expenditure on classes for adult education, a service which was growing steadily in volume and which exerted a beneficial influence quite out of proportion to the annual  expenditure which it involved.      I propose to remove these restrictions and to encourage  the natural development of the movement;    both on the ground of its educational value and because I think that this step will go far to gain support for our general programme from the vocal and not uninfluential section of the community which is interested in this aspect of education.    Difficulties of organisation will render this expansion a matter of time and I should not expect that the additional expenditure would amount to more than . 15,000 a year by 1941-42.

I have, therefore, not attempted to consult my colleagues on such details before seeking their general approval to the Programme which I have outlined above.28.      I append a summary of the recommendations made in this memorandum, together with an estimate of the additional annual cost to the Exchequer (including Scotland) over a series of years.      I also add for purpose of comparison a note of the expenditure which would be necessitated by the raising of the school leaving age without exemptions.27th June, 1935. 0,FoG.S.

(a) The Estimate for raising the school age is based on the assumption that the Bill will be passed by the end of December 1936 and that the appointed day will be 1st April, 1940.(b) The other estimates are based on the assumption that an announcement of the programme will be made in the late Autumn of 1935 and in any case not later than December, 1935.     Although Local Authorities will bein a position to begin some of their arrangements for a part of the financial year 1936-37, the effect will not begin to be felt until 1937-38 and even then only to a small degree.(c) The burden of the whole programme on the rates in England and Wales is estimated to be ultimately  1,325,000 a year.     The cost to the rates of raising the school leaving age to 15 without exemptions and with maintenance allowances would be about  3,500,000 a year.
