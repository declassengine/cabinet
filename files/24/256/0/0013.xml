INDIA.Appreciation of the Political Situation, by the Government of India,  dated 15th July,  1935.Circulated for t.he information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
144Confidential appreciation of the Political Situation in India, dated the 15th July, 1935, issued on the authority of the Secretary of Statefor India..1.      The difficult problems of administration and relief arising from the Quetta earthquake have received much attention during the past month.     By the 17th June, approximately 32,200 survivors had been evacuated by rail from the stricken area, including about 20,000 who had been treated for minor injuries and nearly 700 serious hospital cases.    140 survivors were also evacuated by aircraft. Elaborate arrangements were made by the Governments of the Punjab and North West Frontier Province .and by the authorities in Sind for the reception and care of the destitute and wounded.      Refugee camps were established at various centres, where survivors were fed and provided with clothing and medical comforts,  and with money from the Viceroy&apos;s Relief Fund to meet their immediate needs.      Free railway passes and small cash grants were also provided to enable refugees to reach their homes, and special instructions were issued to District Officers to do all in their power to help refugees arriving in their areas.      Special hospital accomodation was also arranged, and, with the hearty co-operation of volunteer organisations and individual helpers, no effort has been spared to ease the lot of the thousands who have suffered by the calamity.      The Relief Fund which has now reached a total of over Rs.25 lakhs,  is being administered by His Excellency The Viceroy with the advice of a Committee of his Executive Council,and the (detailed administration of the fund,  including distribttion of relief,  is being conducted by District Officers and their subordinates, with the co-operation, where necessary, of local non-official Associati ons.A comprehensive plan   for the distribution of relief/
relief must necessarily await a decision on the ultimate future of Quetta, which Government is now considering, and the measures of relief will, of course,  depend upon total amount of the funds.     By the 28th June, the situation in the earthquake area had so improved that it was found possible to restore control to the civil authorities, who are being provided by the military authorities with such additional assistance as they require, and the resources at their disposal are ample to meet all requirements.      The admission to the earthquake area of volunteer relief parties for which there has been a. constant agitation by a section of the press, and by Congress politicians, is unnecessary and would merely add to the difficulties of the local authorities.      The report of the Public Health Commissioner to the Government of India who was deputed to visit Quetta to report on the health situation there and to examine the question of when salvage operations could safely be resumed without risk of epidemic desease has been published. The question of salvage, which is of vital importance to those whose px&quot;operty lies buried in the ruins, was discussed fully with the local authorities by their Excellencies the Viceroy and the Commander in Chief when they visited Quetta early this month.      In the light of those discussions and of the Public Health Commissioner^ recommendations, &quot;the Governor-General in Council has decided that preliminary salvage operations in certain areas where they can safely be undertaken should be commenced at an early date and that a systematic scheme of salvage over the whole area, which has already been worked out provisionally,  shall be put into&apos; operation as soon as practicable.The task will necessarily take many months to complete.      Reference was made in the previous appreciation to criticism in certain section of press of the measures taken/
MStaken by the authorities and to the circulation of false rumours .and charges against the troops.     Much has been done by constant dissemination of the facts of the situation to counteract the effects on the public mind of such unscrupulous political propaganda.     But in several instances, notably in the case of the free press journals of Bombay,  the Government has found it essential in the public interests to take action under the Press Act.      This action has had a a salutary effect on the Nationalist press as a whole and a marked improvement in the tone of the more extreme papers has resulted.      On his visit to the earthquake area, His Excellency the Viceroy was accompanied by Her Excellency the Countess of Willingdon.      In addition to a close examination of the situation in Quetta and the surrounding area,  Their Excellencies visited hospitals in the Punjab . and Sind where injured are being cared for.The fact that this visit was undertaken duringihe hot weather and that Their Excellencies displayed a close interest in the welfare of the refugees and spent a large part of the time in personal contact with the sufferers has created a profound impression.     At the ceremonial parades at Quetta and Karachi, His Excellency conveyed the thanks of the Government of India to the military and to the Royal Air Force for their admirable work in the disaster.Grateful acknowledgment is provided for the contributions to the Viceroy&apos;s Relief Fund of  50,000 by the Government of the United Kingdom, of  10,000 Australian currency by the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia, of  1,000 by the Government of New Zealand,  of Rs.10,000 by the Government of Mauritius, and of  1,000 by the Italian Government.     As already announced, the Government of India have sanctioned a grant of Rs. 10 lakhs to supp] eme;it the Fund and to ensure that adequate Funds are available for the purpose of immediate relief.
14?2.      Apart from 1he earthquake the main interest of the past month has lain in communal matters.      There has been a somewhat unexpected outburst of Moslem feeling in regard to that Clause of the Government of India Bill which provides for &quot;the making of future changes in the composition of end in the methods of choosing members of the Legislatures.     As there had been no substantive amendments in this Clause since the Bill was published in January last, the agitation cams unexpectedly, though Muhammadsn opinion is often slow in finding expression. There is reason to believe that the agitation was originally based on a misapprehension as to the effect of certain minor amendments, but it finally concentrated on the fact that the Bill did not give definite statutory effect to- one conditio.. of what is commonly known as the Communal Award, which was made by His Majesty&apos;s Government in 1933 after the communities concerned had failed to come to any amicable agreement among themselves. That condition was that changes would only be made with the consent of the minority communities concerned.A statement issued by the Government of India with the authority of the Secretary of State on the 4-th July, has done much to allay Muharamadan fear end to stop agitation, and with the further amendments which are now under contemplation the final form of the Clause is likely to satisfy all but the extreme communal section of the Muhammad ens,.     A much more dangerous demonstration of communal feeling has occurred in Lahore as the result of a dispute between Sikhs and Euhaihmadans over a mosque which is situated in the precincts of a Sikh temple.      The mosque has been in the Sikhs&apos; possession for 170 years end has been the subject of much litigation, which has confirmed the Sikhs&apos; right of possession.      Although the mosque had for many years &quot;been put to a purely  secular use a rumour that the Sikhs proposed to demolish it roused Moslem feeling to such an extent that the danger arose of a serious clash &quot;between.
the two communities.     While strenuous efforts were being madeby His Excellency the Governor of the Punjab and his officers to reach an amicable settlement,  the Sikhs, under the pressure of extremist influence, began the work of demolition.This placed the authorities in a most diffiucltposition.    On the one hand they could do nothing to stop thework, partly because the Sikhs were within their legal rightsand partly because the only effective method would have been tresort to firing, which would,  owing to the temple being full of Sikhs, have resulted in bloodshed on a large scalewith serious reactions on the Sikh population throughout the punjab.      On the other hand,  inaction by Government was boundto react unfavourably on Moslem feeling and it was anticipatedthat this would show itself by sporadic attacks on Sikhs.Every precaution was taken by the authorities to prevent such attacks and it is a tribute to the efficiency of theseprecautions that up to date only 4 murderous assaults with  deaths have been reported.      There has been a state of acute tension for the past -week and though the situation isunder control, it continues to give cause for much anxiety. The latest reports indicate that Moslem feeling, which was originally directed against the Sikhs, may, under extremist&apos;enti-Government influence,-,  tend to turn definitely againstthe Government.3.      Congress activities have recently bem mainlydirected towards the campaign for the recruitment of new members.     The response has been considerably in someprovinces, but the Congress authorities are themselvesdisappointed with the general result, which falls far short of their expectation.      They recognise that the total cannotexceed 200,000 against an expectation of one million.      Itwould,  of course, be a mistake to estimate the strength ofthe Congress  organisation by the number of its enrolledmembers/
members.      The Government of Madras point to the fact that the campaign was pursued throughout the hot weather as evidence both of the determination and organisation of the Congress while Bombay report that a recent visit of the Congress President has certainly increased its influence in that Presidency.      In other provinces the campaign has aroused little Interest or enthusiasm.
