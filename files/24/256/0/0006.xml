Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1935.SECRET. Copy No.OP. 146 (35).CABINET.SUPPLY OF ARMS TO ABYSSINIA THROUGH BRITISH.SOMALILAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.IN connection with CP. 138 (35), I. wish to invite the attention of my colleagues to the fact that it will be necessary to decide whether we should permit any large consignments of arms destined for Abyssinia to be transported through British Somaliland. I much regret that it has not been possible to circulate a memorandum on this point before, but it was necessary to await a reply to certain telegraphic enquiries which I had made of the Governor of the Protectorate.&apos;2. Both the firms which have recently applied for export licences from this country propose to send their consignments to Berber a, the port of British Somaliland, and to transport them thence by road across the Protectorate to Abyssinia. Further, a letter has been recently received in the Colonial Office from another firm, stating that it is desired to carry a supply of arms of unspecified quantity to Abyssinia through British Somaliland, and that, should there be any difficult)- in securing an export licence from this country, the necessary supply would be purchased abroad. (It is understood that despite the official under-takings given to Italy by certain continental countries not to supply arms to Abyssinia, the firm would probably have little difficulty in obtaining such a supply.) The position is, therefore, that even if it is decided not to permit the export of arms from this country to Abyssinia, it will still be necessary to decide whether supplies obtained elsewhere are to be taken through British Somaliland.3. Although the transit of arms to Abyssinia through British Somaliland is authorised by the Arms Traffic Treaty of 1930, this route is never normally used for any large consignments of arms. Hitherto arms taken by this route have been negligible in amount, and have consisted of only a few shot guns. The route normally used for the transport of arms to Abyssinia is the Jibuti-Addis Ababa Railway. As is pointed out in CP. 138, transit through Jibuti is still nominally being allowed by the French authorities. It is clear, however, that the would-be consignors of supplies of arms to Abyssinia fear that such supplies would not be allowed to proceed beyond Jibuti, and therefore prefer to send them by what is an abnormal and difficult route, although the recent purchase and shipment through Berbera of a large supply of motor vehicles by the Abyssinian Government means that difficulties are not likely to arise on account of the shortage of motor transport.4. As is mentioned in CP. 138, the project put forward by Walford Lines (Limited) in May of this year involved the shipping of arms and ammunition to Abyssinia via British Somaliland. Apparently a very large con-signment was contemplated; it was understood that it would probably have comprised 200,000 rifles, a quantity of machine guns, and also a large quantity of small arms and ammunition. When the project was broached at the Colonial Office the firm indicated that they would like the Government of British Somaliland to provide an escort for the material on its way through the Protectorate.The proposal put forward by Walford Lines was submitted to the Cabinet on the 15th May, when it was decided that the firm should be informed that it[11896]
would not be possible for &apos;a military&apos; escort &quot;to b&apos;e provided: for the passage of aconsignment.....of  war  material - to Abyssinia  through  Somaliland   (cabinet conclusions 27 (35), Item 5). This decision was conveyed to the firm, who stated, however,,-that they were not prepared to abandon the project because of this,1 bu,t would&quot;&apos;p&apos;rovide their own escort of picked British ex-service men, as they had done elsewhere in similar cases in the past. The matter was again referred, to the Cabinet, and on their instructions (Cabinet Conclusions 28 (35), Item&apos; 9) llie&apos; firm were informed that&apos; in the interests of public order and security in Somaliland it was impossible to allow such an escort as was contemplated to operate in the Protectorate. It was made clear to the firm, also on the Cabinet&apos;s instructions, that His Majesty&apos;s Government did not wish the project to be carried out in the existing difficult situation. The firm then agreed to abandon the project.5. I have consulted the Governor of Somaliland in regard to the two con-signments in respect of which applications for export licences have been made. He assures me that the passage of these or similar consignments by recognised routes through the Protectorate would cause him neither anxiety nor embarrass-ment. It would, however, be necessary for escorts to be provided (at the consignor&apos;s expense) from the military or police forces available in Somaliland; ho difficulty is seen in finding the necessary personnel for this service.h    6.   The following questions arise:-(a) If escorts are provided from military or police forces in Somaliland;, it might be contended that His Majesty&apos;s Government was going out of &apos; its way to facilitate the supply of arms to Abyssinia, especially if theft Jibuti route is still open, and in view of the fact that escorts are not&apos; --to, provided for ordinary merchandise in transit through &quot;the &apos; Protectorate to Abyssinia. .I- (b) Although, when the treaty of 1930 was concluded, it was not con tern-X plated that any large supplies of arms would be taken to Abyssiniathrough British Somaliland, it would appear (vide paragraph 8 of CP. 138) that we are under a definite obligation to permit such 1 transit, subject to compliance with the provisions of the Treaty itself;a .. and it is difficult, therefore, to see how we could withhold permission-fi in the present cases. : ; ,7. I should add that whatever instructions are sent to the Governor&apos; of Somaliland in the matter should also be sent to the Governor of Kenya, since it is possible that it might be desired to take arms to Abyssinia via Kenya. This is, however, very improbable, since the route is such a roundabout and difficult one.(Initialled) M. M.&quot;&apos;;    Colonial Office, Downing Street. j July 17, 1935.
