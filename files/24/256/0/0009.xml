^-* i JL 3.2THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT1).sj E C RE T. r;.F.  149  (55) .CAB  I NET.PUBLIC WORKS LOANS DDLL, 1955.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.(1) The main purpose of this Bill is to fix themaximum sum which may he issued to the Public Works Loan Commissioners for the purpose of making loans from the Local Loans Fund up to the date of the passing of a further Bill.      It is therefore a recurrent measure, not necessarily at  regular intervals, hut normally at intervals of a year.      As a rule the amount is fixed at a figure somewhat exceeding the estimated requirements for the next 12 months,  so as to allow a margin in case of delay before further statutory powers can he obtained.(2) The current Act was passed in July,  1954,  and-authorises lending up to a maximum of  18 millions.      Itis not    likely that that limit will he reached before the...end of the calendar year hut for reasons of Parliamentary time it is thought that the Bill should he Introduced &quot;before the House rises in order that it may he proceeded with when they meet again.(5) The limit now proposed is  20 millions.      With areasonable allowance for slum clearance and water supply requirements, advances during the next 12 months are not expected to exceed  12 millions 5    hut it is thought desirable to provide against the exigencies of the copy NO. U &amp;
Parliamentary time table?    moreover a lower figure might be criticised, as suggesting the possibility of a restriction in &quot;borrowings for capital expenditure *      There is no fear that the higher figure will militate against financial control.(4) At intervals of 5 years it is necessary tore-appoint the public. Works Loan Commissioners.      The term of office of the present Board expires on the 31st March nexto      It is therefore necessary to include in this Bill a clause appointing the new Commissioners.      It  is proposed to re-appoint the Commissioners who at present are serving. This is in accordance with the usual practice.(5) The Bill also on this occasion contains twoclauses out of the ordinary routine.      The first  of these abolishes the existing minimum rate applying to advances from the Local Loans Fund, which was fixed, some 4-0 years ago at        , a rate which may conceivably be found, to be unsuitably high in the near future.      The other enables any advantage that may result from a possible conversion of Local Loans Stock to be passed on to the borrowers from the Local Loans Fund..(6) I ask for approval of the present Bill inprinciple and for authority to introduce it before the House rises.(Intld.)
