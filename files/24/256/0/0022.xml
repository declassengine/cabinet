Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1935.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 162 (35).CABINET.ITALO-ETHIOPIAN DISPUTE.Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues herewith a memorandum prepared in the Foreign Office regarding certain points for consideration by His Majesty&apos;s Government in connexion with the discussions between the United Kingdom, France and Italy concerning Abyssinia.S. H.Foreign Office, August 16, 1935.MEMORANDUM.Points for Consideration by His Majesty&apos;s Government in connexion with the Imminent Discussions between the United Kingdom, France, and Italy concerning Abyssinia. ......THERE are three aspects under which it seems necessary to consider the situation arising out of the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia, namely: (1) Local, involving British interests in Abyssinia itself, the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, and Egypt; (2) Imperial, involving the general interests of the British Empire; and (3) general, involving the political situation in Europe and through-out the world.(1) Local.The Interdepartmental Committee on British interests in Ethiopia, presided over by Sir J. Maffey, summarised their findings in the following terms : &quot;(1) Italy will undoubtedly endeavour during, the next few years to secure control over Ethiopia, although her immediate action may be confined to obtaining an accession of low-lying territory on the borders of Italian Somaliland.&quot;(2) No such vital British interest is concerned in and round Ethiopia as would make it essential for His Majesty&apos;s Government to resist an Italian conquest of Ethiopia. While effective Italian control of Ethiopia would be of advantage in some ways (e.g., as giving security on the frontiers), it would operate to our disadvantage in others (e.g., in trade). Generally speaking, however, so far as local British interests are concerned, there is no balance of advantage in either direction, i.e., if Ethiopia remains independent or if it is absorbed by Italy.&quot; (3) From the standpoint of Imperial defence, an independent Ethiopia would be preferable to an Italian Ethiopia, but the threat to British interests is a remote one, and depends on the unlikely event of a war with Italy.&quot;(4) The most vital British interest in Ethiopia remains Lake Tsana and the Nile Basin. This is also a vital, interest of Egypt, which His Majesty&apos;s Government are bound to protect. In the event of the dis-appearance of Ethiopia as an independent State, His Majesty&apos;s Government should aim at securing territorial control over Lake Tsana, and a suitable corridor linking it to the Sudan.8093   [12014] b
(5) Similarly, in the event of the establishment of Italian control over Ethiopia, His Majesty&apos;s Government should take steps to secure the safe-guarding of British interests in the other tributaries of the Nile flowing in Ethiopia, e.g., the Sobat, by obtaining a definite undertaking that no works will be constructed on those rivers interrupting or diminishing their flow without prior concurrence of His Majesty&apos;s Government and of the Egyptian Government.&quot; (6) Should it not be possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to secure territorial control over Lake Tsana and the adjacent areas as suggested in (4) above, they should take all possible steps to safeguard British and Egyptian interests in regard to Lake Tsana, and should use the opportunity to secure less onerous terms for the construction of a barrage on the lake.&quot; (7) It is essential that every endeavour be made to secure for protected British tribes in Somaliland the right, to the unimpeded use of their habitual grazing grounds across the frontier in what is now Ethiopian territory, either by securing an accession of territory or by obtaining from the Italians recognition of the right to use the grazing grounds in what will become Italian territory.&quot;(8) Although British and Indian trade interests in Ethiopia are negligible and although there are no large-scale British enterprises estab-lished in Ethiopia, every endeavour should be made, in the event of an Italian absorption of Ethiopia, to secure that British subjects have, as now, equal opportunities for trading in Ethiopian territory, i.e., efforts should be made to maintain the &apos; open door&apos; in Ethiopia. Steps should also be taken, if practicable, to safeguard the direct and transit trade between Ethiopia, British Somaliland and the Sudan a trade of some importance in the economy of the two latter territories.&quot; (9) Opportunity should be taken, if possible, to obtain frontier adjust-ments on the frontiers of British Somaliland, Kenya and the Sudan, in order to incorporate in these territories areas linked to them economically and ethnographically.&quot;In the view of the committee, then, it would seem unnecessary, as far as British local interests are concerned, to attempt to prevent the acquisition by Italy of control over Abyssinia. At the same time, while in the body of their report (p. 21) they state that effective Italian control would not directly or immediately threaten any vital British interests (assuming always that our interests in Lake Tsana were amply safeguarded), and, in their above-quoted summary, give their opinion that the threat to British interests is a remote one, and dependent on the unlikely event of a war with Italy, they hold that, from the standpoint of Imperial defence, an independent Ethiopia would be preferable to an Italian Ethiopia, since by effective Italian control the balance of power in the area in question would be altered to Italy&apos;s advantage, and a possible, if remote, threat to British control over the Sudan and the upper waters of the Nile would require to be taken into account. Into general strategic considerations the committee do not go deeply, though they point out, in pp. 19, 20 and 21 of their report, that the fact that a first-class European Power would have a frontier of over 2,000 miles with neigh-bouring British dependencies, including the Sudan, might in peace time alone compel us to revise our ideas of defence requirements for these territories, and that the probable organisation of Italian colonial forces in North-East Africa, the recruiting reservoir for which forces would be immensely increased by the acquisition of Abyssinia, might, in the event of war with Italy, constitute a more serious threat than at present to our strategical position in the Red Sea. This seems to constitute a sufficiently serious potential situation in itself, and it calls for a serious study.[In this connexion, if, with the consent of the Emperor of Abyssinia, a solution of the problem is found which involves anything like Italian control in that country, might it not be possible to lay down as a condition of our consent that the Italian Government should not recruit the native inhabitants for their armed forces. This condition applies in the case of mandated territory.]But it does not appear to be sufficient to contemplate the potentialities which a state of war holds for the interests in the vicinity of Abyssinia of imperial defence.  There are dangers from the presence of an unfriendly, or even a friendly,
Italy in control of Abyssinia, not only from the standpoint of military defence, but also, and perhaps more so, from a political point of view. We could, by an effort, no doubt provide against the military threat, but even if the military situation were thus stabilised, Italy could use her presence in areas so vitally important from the material point of view for the Sudan and Egypt, and, from the point of view of prestige, for the United Kingdom, in order to pursue policies highly embarrassing to His Majesty&apos;s Government, and perhaps only susceptible of effective restraint by the use of force, which, in the situation contemplated, His Majesty&apos;s Government would no doubt dispose of, but which they would naturally be reluctant to employ. It may not be an excessive exaggeration to suggest that Italy harbours the long-range ambition of uniting her North African territory of Libya with her territory in East Africa, whatever extent the latter may eventually assume. She has already pushed her Libyan frontier eastwards as against Egypt by the acquisition of Jaghbub, while in the south of Libya she has moved both eastwards as against the Sudan by the acquisition of the Sarra triangle and south-wards by the acquisition of the strip of French Equatorial Africa conceded to her under the Franco-Italian Agreement of January of this year. It is possible that she hopes gradually to secure further territory in such a way as to enclose Egypt and the Sudan in a pocket, or to advance the jaws of the pincers so far as almost to achieve this object. It is not impossible that she even hopes to push westwards or north-westwards from East Africa across the Sudan itself, and in connexion with this possibility, remote though it doubtless is, it may be useful to remember that the Sudan is divided into two very different portions, that of the north being Mahometan with Egyptian affiliation, that of the south being pagan and totally devoid of any link with Egypt.But it is unnecessary to consider remote speculations of this kind in order to appreciate the political effects of Italian acquisition of the territory of Ethiopia on our position in Egypt and the Sudan. The opinion which the Egyptians and Sudanese hold of British power must suffer a relative diminution by an increase in that of Italy, especially when it takes place in their vicinity and in an area of Africa where Italy is already strongly entrenched, and in which she has given evidence of vigour and the determination to exert and augment her influence and generally to expand. But if the increase of power in question is brought about by an act of manifestly unwarranted aggression which we are known to disapprove, which it is clear we cannot from the point of our own interests relish, which we are under an obligation to prevent, and which we shall have done our best (though ex hypothesi ineffectually) to forestall, then it is impossible to escape the conclusion that our value to Egypt and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan as protectors and friends, not to mention the authority which we there exert, must suffer in the eyes, of the Egyptians and perhaps even of the Sudanese. And though the sentiment of these peoples towards the Italians is likely to become unfriendly, it is improbable that it will therefore become more friendly towards us. The first effect of Italy&apos;s action has no doubt been to create a salutary feeling of relief amongst Egyptians that they are spared both in pocket and perhaps in skin by our presence and our protection, and to render them perhaps more amenable; but a considerable increase in Italian strength and influence in East Africa and a failure on our part to prevent this, where it could be held that we ought to have prevented it, are in the end likely to alter this state of feeling to our detriment, and while our authority is in consequence impaired, the dislike and distrust of the Italians will produce not so much liking for us, as an increase of nationalist feeling fanned by resentment of European imperialism. This nationalist resentment will not be diminished by any increase in the number of troops which in the new circumstances we may feel it necessary to station in Egypt and the Sudan.If Italy is ensconced in the territory round or near Lake Tsana, she will not need to interfere with the flow of water from the lake in order to embarrass us with Egypt and the Sudan. Whatever assurances she might give us with regard to the lake and the Blue Nile and its tributaries, the fact that she would, never-theless, be in a position to interfere therewith would be calculated to embarrass His Majesty&apos;s Government considerably in the event of her making any unwelcome demands on or in Egypt.Sir John Maffey&apos;s Committee in their report (pp. 22 and 28), and the Sudan Government in a memorandum recently received, suggest that should Ethiopia be about to pass under Italian control, His Majesty&apos;s Government should aim at[12014] b 2
securing territorial control over Lake Tsana and a suitable corridor linking it to.the Sudan, It seems probable, even inevitable, that the question of Lake Tsana will conic up during the discussions in Paris between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French and Italian Governments, and it may become necessary by word or even perhaps by deed to make it quite clear to Italy that, in the words used by Sir Edward Grey in 1913, &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government could not possibly consent to the passing of Lake Tsana under any control but our own&quot; (if Ethiopia broke up). The difficulty here is (and Italy may well attempt to put us in the wrong by forcing us into a false position in this respect) that it is highly embarrassing to inform a potential aggressor beforehand that we intend to enjoy a part of the anticipated fruits of his aggression, at the expense of his victim. This is a point to which Sir S. Barton also drew attention in a recent telegram, and it seems hardly possible that our reputation could emerge unscathed from : such a position. Italy, moreover, judging by her attitude on this question in the past, is likely to oppose any demand on our part to territorial occupation of the area round Lake Tsana, and if we were to try to realise our wishes by amicable means, would probably demand some substantial quid pro quo. A concrete bargain of this sort would wear a worse aspect even than a statement that rather than let Italy occupy the territory, we should do so ourselves. It is not intended to argue that His Majesty&apos;s Government should not make certain of protecting British interests in this locality, but rather to suggest that the matter needs delicate handling if we are not to appear in an invidious light. It has been suggested elsewhere that if the matter of Lake Tsana is raised in an acute form by Italy during the course of the meeting at Paris, it might be possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to state that if she attacked Abyssinia in defiance of the Covenant and of the Kellogg Pact, Plis Majesty&apos;s Government would consider their engagements under the treaty of 1906 and the exchange of letters of 1925 as invalidated, and that they would consider themselves free to take what measures they might think necessary to protect their interests in the Basin of the Blue Nile. If this situation should arise, might it not be possible for this country, having once resumed freedom of action vis-a-vis of Italy, to attempt to negotiate a lease of territory embracing Lake Tsana and the Blue Nile Basin from Ethiopia?2. Imperial A sped.If Italy were to ensconce herself in Abyssinia, her position on the Red Sea coast would, as is pointed out by Sir John Maffey&apos;s Committee, constitute a more serious threat than at present to our strategical position in the Red Sea. The threat should not perhaps be considered only from the point of view of the unlikely possibility of a war between the United Kingdom and Italy. Italy can clearly exploit the value of such a position to the full in peace time, and the importance of the Eastern Mediterranean, Egypt and the Suez Canal, the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden as an essential link in our communications with India, Singapore, Australasia and the Far East must obviously be seriously affected. This, however, is a matter for consideration by, e.g., the Committee of Imperial Defence, and it is only mentioned here because the report of Sir John Maffey&apos;s Committee only refers to it in passing, since the scope of their enquiry was purposely confined to the consideration of strictly local British interests.The Dominions in Australasia, and perhaps the Union of South Africa, and the Colonies and the British mandated territory on the east coast of Africa, are bound to be deeply interested in any modification of the position affecting this link in Imperial communications, and it seems important that their probable opinion on this subject should be taken carefully into account.3. The General Aspect.The political effect of an Italian absorption of Abyssinia has been considered above in its more local aspect. The political effect can by no means remain merely local. The presence of Italy in strength on the Sudan frontier and close to Egypt, coupled with its influence on our moral position in those countries, must, it seems, constitute an ever-present threat for our general policy, and at any rate produce a serious element of uncertainty in that it will be necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government continually to ask themselves what action Italy may take in respect of the very vulnerable British interest in that part of the world. This must produce an unsettling effect on the position in Europe and seriously modify
the European balance. Thus in the end this country may in any case be faced with, the very situation, which by the restrained attitude it was necessary for it to adopt at the outset towards Italian action in Abyssinia, it had sought to forestall. . - , - ..: For the rest, the effect of an Italian.war of aggression on Abyssinia on the situation in Europe, in the Far East and on the coloured peoples of Africa and Asia, has been dealt.with fully in the despatch to Sir G. Clerk; No. 140.1 of the 29th July (a copy of which is attached hereto), and it is unnecessary to repeat the arguments contained therein in the present memorandum.Conclusion.In general it is very clear the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the tripartite discussions with France and Italy is bound to be a very delicate one. The primary object of the discussions is to find a solution under the League of the problem set by the Italian aggressive designs upon Ethiopia, and by the grievance which Italy unconvincingly alleges against Ethiopia in justification of her intentions. But Italy&apos;s original suggestion for an exchange of views with His Majesty&apos;s Government adumbrated for the subject of such exchange, the respective interests of both Governments in Ethiopia, and the exploration of the possibility of the development of such interests in a mutually harmonious manner. This fact and the fact that in the meeting between the French and Italian Govern-ments at Rome in January of this year, it was only the mutual interests of those two countries that were dealt with when Abyssinia came under discussion, make it tolerably clear that Italy&apos;s object in the Paris discussions will be not so much to seek an honourable solution of her &quot; dispute &quot; with Ethiopia as to secure the victory of her interests (or aggressive designs), and to obtain support from France and Great Britain by assuring them, as far as may be necessary, respect of and security for their interests. His Majesty&apos;s Government are therefore likely to be faced by an attempt on Italy&apos;s part, probably backed up by France in view of the Rome Agreement, to steer the discussions towards what may amount to a concrete partition of Abyssinia rather than towards an honourable and peaceful settlement of the dispute she has forced on that country. The dangers and embarrassment for His Majesty&apos;s Government if she finds herself in this position are obvious. (The article in the Ajfari Esteri, quoted in the attached cutting from to-day&apos;s Times, lends point to the above, which was drafted a day or two ago. The writer clearly contemplates the Paris discussions as intended merely for the protection of mutual interests by the three Powers. One passage seems to point to a wish on the part of Italy to proceed from an agreement between the United Kingdom, France and Italy for the protection of their respective interests, to a decision that the protection of these interests demands that the provision of the 1906 Treaty for the maintenance of the status quo in or integrity of Abyssinia should no longer be considered as valid. Such a procedure is the exact reverse of what is presumably the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government in going to the meeting. The remainder of the quotation from the article is a direct invitation to His Majesty&apos;s Government to abandon their principles in the cause of collective security and international decency in favour of their own selfish local interests.) Another more obvious danger is that His Majesty&apos;s Government will find them-selves in the following position, namely, that in the face of a solution agreed between Italy and France, which will go beyond what His Majesty&apos;s Government consider should rightfully be demanded of Abyssinia, they will have to choose between breaking up the discussions without agreement or condoning action vis-a-vis of Abyssinia which they strongly disapprove a choice which must clearly be difficult.It is for this reason, amongst others, that it seems of such great importance that Abyssinia should at some moment take part in the conversations at Paris, or at any rate that any solution agreed to therein should be subject to the Emperor&apos;s consent and therefore of such a nature as could properly and with a fair chance of success be proposed to him for his consent.Another matter which may well fall to be dealt with at Paris is that of the embargo on the export of arms from the United Kingdom either to Italy or to Abyssinia. It will clearly be necessary in the near future for His Majesty&apos;s Government to decide whether they shall maintain this embargo, which they told the House of Commons was being imposed for the time being. The development of the conversations and the attitude of Italy as revealed therein are likely to [12014] B 3
provide the test by which His Majesty&apos;s government will reach their decision oh the question whether to maintain the embargo, and, if so, for how much--longer; It might well be desirable that Italy should be asked by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and the French Government whether, in the absence of aggression on Abyssinia&apos;s part, she intends to reach a peaceful solution of the difficulties1 with that country. If she refused to give an assurance that such was her intention, the British and French Governments would then have ample reason for raising the embargo in favour of Abyssinia, and, if an explanation were needed by public opinion and by the House of Commons, His Majesty&apos;s government would,&quot;&apos;!! would seem, have no difficulty in justifying their action. Even a simple raising of the embargo in favour of both countries would perhaps suffice to redress the balance to some extent in favour of Abyssinia.Foreign Office, August 9, 1935.ANNEX I.[J 3204/1/1J&apos;.  Sir Samuel Hoare to Sir 67. Clerk (Paris). &apos;(No. 1401.   Confidential.)Sir, Foreign Office, July 29, 1935.THOUGH only a few days are left before M. Laval and Mr. Eden will be meeting at the Council table at Geneva, His Majesty&apos;s Government feel it essential that the French Government should be fully aware of the background of their deepest anxieties in connexion with the disastrous conflict which is now clearly threatening between Italy and Abyssinia.2. It is, therefore, not only natural but needful that I should recall to M. Laval&apos;s attention, in quite general terms, some of the consequences which must or may flow from an Italo-Abyssinian war, and to appeal to him most earnestly to consider whether no form of joint action between our two countries be, even at this late hour, open to us to deflect Signor Mussolini from his extreme courses, which are like to compass the destruction of European solidarity, and so, in their consequences, to demonstrate that no clear distinction can in effect be drawn, as has been suggested by the Quai d&apos;Orsay, between European and non-European controversies. Alternatively, it seems to me not too early to consider how the United Kingdom Government and the French Government can best in co-operation avert some of the serious consequences of an Abyssinian war on the general European position. I am not forgetting that the French Government have lately been much preoccupied by domestic affairs; but if, as I hope, I may feel that they are now in a fair way to surmount the domestic crisis, I shall be justified in begging M. Laval to devote his most earnest attention to the subject of this despatch and to an exhaustive search for means to ensure close and continuous co-operation between the two Governments.3. War then between Italy and Abyssinia will have some results on Italy, considered as a factor in European politics, which are certain in nature though unpredictable in extent. Other results with which I will first deal, are matters of speculation dependent upon the degree of success or failure attending the Italian expeditionary force.4. Italy&apos;s war with Abyssinia may be either short and successful, or pro-tracted and, for a time, indeterminate, or, again, it may end in a definite reverse.5: A short and successful war with Abyssinia will probably increase the prestige of the Fascist Government at home and abroad, raise the moral and efficiency of the higher command and enhance Signor Mussolini&apos;s confidence in his own judgment and contempt for foreign opinion. Indeed, it might well satisfy the Italian craving and need for expansion overseas. These consequences of a short and successful war should not in themselves predispose him to modify the general relationship in which he has recently stood to other Great Powers. But the circumstances in which the war would, on this hypothesis, be brought to a conclusion are not the circumstances of to-day. It must be anticipated that hostilities will have been begun in the face of foreign oppo-sition clearly expressed at Geneva.  The Italian Government will have flouted the
League of Nations not only with impunity but with apparent advantage. Now the policy of Italy is, in general, opportunist and incalculable; and openly and successfully to have challenged the public law and public opinion of a great part of the civilised world will not make it less opportunist or less incalculable. Indeed, the reverse may well be the case.6. Be that as it may, it seems certain that a protracted and, for a time, indeterminate war undertaken, as this war would be, in the face of opposition from some of the Great Powers hitherto associated with Italy, opens an even more serious prospect. The balance of power is an overworked expression. The relations of the Great Powers with each other are dynamic rather than static. Their position in relation to each other is determined by the forces of attraction or repulsion exercised by each upon all. If within this complex the force of any one Power is diminished, the position of each relatively to the others will change. Such a result is as inevitable in politics as in physics. Now, if Italy finds herself grappled to an exhausting African adventure for a period of months, or, as it may well be, years, her political energy in Europe will decline. This energy, in conjunction with other forces, has hitherto sufficed if barely sufficed to repel, for example, the pressure of Germany upon Austria. If it is diminished, the unstable equilibrium in which the independence of Austria is poised will be upset. Austria provides the most obvious theatre in which a political event of first-class importance might be expected to follow a displacement of the forces by which the stability of Europe is maintained, but there are other ways in which pressure from Germany might operate with equally serious effect in a theatre where resistance to her policy had been gravely impaired; indeed, the tempo of her advance towards a preponderance in Central and South-Eastern Europe would be accelerated in all directions. I should not add to the weight of these representations by multiplying instances of the precise ways in which such an accelerated advance in German influence would threaten British interests or French interests or the interests which both, as well as numerous other countries, have in restraining German policy within the limits of what is orderly, peaceful and equitable. My object is rather to move M. Laval to draw upon his own imagination by restating a well-known doctrine of international relations and emphasising its special importance in the circumstances of to-day.7. Lastly, from the larger European view the results of an Italian reverse in Abyssinia are even more speculative than, but as alarming as, the probable results of an indeterminate campaign. Italy&apos;s credit might suffer total collapse; hardships for the population must, in any case, be multiplied; Signor Mussolini would have to bear the blame; the regime as well as the Dictator might be in jeopardy; political and economic panic might ensue; Italian foreign policy would either fall into confusion or become a mere function of domestic strife. It might well be that Italy&apos;s foreign policy would in such circumstances be pawned to those who could and would lend to her, but her prestige and prosperity would have suffered a blow likely to make her influence and stability negligible where matters of high policy in Europe were concerned.8. I pass now to consideration of two results of war between Italy and Abyssinia, whatever be its course, duration or issue, which can be predicted with more assurance.9. It is certain that Italy is already experiencing difficulty in balancing her budget and in securing the foreign exchange required for the maintenance of a reasonable standard of life. It is certain that these difficulties will be increased by the financial strain of a war even of a short and successful war. Their precise form, development and extent cannot be foreseen; but there can he no doubt that they will diminish the power of the Italian Government in the near future to play that part in European politics to which her size and resources, prudently nourished, would otherwise have entitled her.10. In the second place, we must expect that the effect of war upon the influence of the League of Nations will be wholly bad. The origins, character and purpose of such a war would not, outside Italy, be regarded as doubtful in the light of Signor Mussolini&apos;s own statements. It would by all ordinary persons be held to be a plain war of aggression for the purpose of annexation by a strong member of the League upon a weaker member. One of three results would then he liable to ensue. If the League acquiesced in such a purpose, it would fall into universal and lasting contempt.   Secondly, if it were divided against itself,
it would for the future be viewed not as an organ of peace with a will of its own, but merely as the one theatre for the interplay of self-regarding national policies. Thirdly, if it were formally but ineffectually to condemn the action of the Italian Government and many members are indisposed to, or incapable of, effectual condemnation-Italy would join the growing number of scoffing dissenters. In any event, another and inglorious chapter would have been closed in the history of attempts to substitute a regime of law for international anarchy, and there would have been destroyed one of those factors and that a very important factor which join the United Kingdom with France in the political and moral leadership of Europe. In such circumstances the countries of Central and South-Eastern Europe, filled already with apprehensions at the growing might of Germany, might well be excused for feeling that a term had been set to whatever stability this leadership had secured to them, and for looking elsewhere than to the League and to the two great conservative democracies for support and guidance.11. The inevitable damage to the influence of the League of Nations is the most powerful reason why His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government should, in co-operation with each other, use all possible means to avert a war in Abyssinia. But as, in spite of all their efforts, war may be declared, it is not too soon for them to consider together which of the three possible results on the League, adumbrated above, offers the fewest disadvantages from the point of view of French and British interests.12. I should preface my observations on this point by saying that I was disquieted by the remark by M. Leger reported in your telegram No. 123 of the 22nd July, to the effect that if war ensued, despite all efforts to avert it, it was better that it should come about in a way that was legally permissible. It is true that under the Covenant itself there are circumstances in which resort to war would not be a violation of the obligations undertaken by members of the League. This is, however, not to say that recourse to war in such circumstances would not be a violation of the Pact of Paris. For this reason, and on general grounds, the object of our policy ought not so much to be to keep Italy step by step within the bounds of the Covenant, so that war, if it eventually breaks out, may be legitimate war, but rather to prevent the outbreak of war altogether. It would be undesirable either for France or Great Britain to take any course which might be interpreted as an attempt to guide Italy towards that kind of warfare which lies beyond the so-called &quot; gap &quot; in the Covenant.13. Returning now to the choice which will confront us at Geneva between acquiescence, divided opinions and condemnation of Italian aggression, I would wish to point out to M. Laval certain considerations which apply more particularly to the effect on the foundations of British policy of a serious impairment of the League&apos;s position.14. Should Great Britain unhappily, in the future, be called upon to go to war in defence of international order, it would be essential that she should do so with the unanimous assent or practically unanimous assent of the British people. It is unlikely that such assent would be forthcoming unless it were clear that the cause for which Great Britain was engaging herself was in defence of international order under the authority of the League of Nations, and when I say League of Nations, I mean, not so much the organisation as set up by the Covenant of 1919, as the spirit and principles which inspired the Covenant and have on the whole guided its activities since that date. If these are compromised, that element will disappear which, as I have just explained, is more than anything else requisite for unanimous support for any war in which this country might in future tend or intend to engage. The present crisis is widely regarded in this country as a test not only of the ability of the members of the League to make their own Covenant respected, but as a test of whether the words &quot; collective action,&quot; which are often, and rightly, on our lips, really mean collective action in defence of law and order against aggression from any quarter, or whether the security which is being sought is security against Germany alone. The popular movement in this country in support of the principle of security by collective action might well be arrested unless the principles of the League were steadfastly upheld even at the cost of the apostasy of one more of its principal members.15. Finally, and more particularly, I see from your telegram No. 143 that the French Government feel grave concern over the effect which hostilities between Italy and Abyssinia would have on native opinion in their colonial possessions.
This is clearly a matter of great importance both to the French Government and the Government of the United Kingdom, who are responsible for the administra-tion of so many and such large territories throughout the world. The French Government will have observed that in a recent demonstration at Addis Ababa the dispute was characterised as one between the white and black races, and it appears that the recent outburst of interest in the quarrel shown by public opinion in Japan has in a great degree assumed a racial character. It cannot be doubted that an Italian aggression against Abyssinia will have an unsettling effect upon all native populations. This effect will be spread through Asia as well as Africa, and this at a time when the situation in Europe cannot but cause the gravest pre-occupation to all Governments eager for the preservation of peace. Even if immediate disturbances in colonial possessions need not be anticipated (though it might be rash to assume that none would take place), it may be expected that nationalist feeling, temporarily perhaps quiescent, but, as the French Government out of their own experience will agree, still ardent beneath the surface, will receive fresh stimulus. Any failure on the part of France and the United Kingdom to show their disapproval of the conduct of Italy must surely arouse the resentment of the coloured races; while a failure to make effective by successful restraint of Italy any disapproval which the two Governments may publicly express may well bring them not only ill-will but also disrepute.16. If Italian military measures encounter serious difficulties, and still more if the Italian armies should meet with reverse, the effect can hardly be other than to create or encourage amongst the native races a spirit which may assume unfortunate forms and greatly increase the difficulties of administration. The effects in the special circumstances of an Italian victory over Abyssinia could hardly be less unfortunate. In this case, there must arise extensive feelings of resentment amongst native peoples, and it would, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, be unsafe to assume that such feelings would not receive early expression in varying degree of activity and form. Though in the case now being discussed, as in that discussed in preceding paragraphs, the consequences of a war between Italy and Abyssinia might first be seen in Italian possessions, they would probably not be confined to those areas. Apart from wider repercussions, the neighbouring territories consist largely of French possessions and of countries under British and French influence. It is therefore incumbent on the two Governments to leave nothing undone to prevent the outbreak of hostilities which may well result in the imposition upon Abyssinia of unjust demands or even the extinction of her independence. The Governments of France and the United Kingdom, owing to their position in Europe and their close relations with Italy, are best placed for using their influence with her; and they may well, if unjustly, be deemed by native opinion in two continents, particularly responsible, if they fail to forestall a situation which by its influence upon racial, nationalistic and religious sentiment must add a further measure of unsettlement to an already unsettled world.17. M. Laval will, I trust, in the light of the foregoing, be ready to join me in the following conclusions. There must needs be complete agreement between the French Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government on the disastrous effects of war as set out in this dispatch. I do not imagine that M. Laval would desire to question any one of these premises; but I should none the less be glad to learn his concurrence in them, and for that purpose I should be glad if your Excellency would go through this despatch with him. Such concurrence leads perforce to the need for common action to prevent disaster, whatever guise it may put on. This common action must be as speedy and as full as possible, if there is to be any prospect of persuading Signor Mussolini to abate his demands, for in this alone resides any prospect of maintaining peace and of escaping wilful and blind disaster, which statesmanship should never have courted, but which statesman-ship might even now avert.I am, &amp;c.SAMUEL HOARE.
ANNEX II.Extract from the Times of August 9, 1935.The Issues for Paris.Italian Suggestions.   . From our Correspondent.Rome, August 8, 1935. ITALY will attend the three-Power conversations under the 1906 treaty with the firm intention of upholding her rights and interests in Abyssinia. She does not seem to entertain much hope of positive results issuing from the conference, but its usefulness and, indeed, the necessity of holding it are readily recognised, since it will serve at least to clarify once for all the respective positions and attitudes of England and France towards the Italo-Abyssinian dispute.Affari Esteri, a weekly review dealing with foreign policy, will to-morrow publish an article devoted to the three-Power conversations which is believed to reflect official opinion.The first task of the three delegates, it says, will be to agree upon the value and bearing of the tripartite treaty. Each of the three Powers has interests in Abyssinia which they all intend to safeguard. Italy has never pretended to ignore such interests and has frequently made solemn affirmations to this effect. Italy objects to the idea that the Abyssinian Government should be kept informed of the negotiations in progress between England, France and Italy. Ethiopia, it it claimed, was not asked to take any part, direct or indirect, in the negotiations which led to the 1906 treaty. She was informed of it when it was concluded, she did not acknowledge it, and no one for that reason cast doubts on its validity. Italy admits that the 1906 treaty is based on the assumption of the maintenance of Abyssinia&apos;s integrity, but, according to Affari Esteri, the reference to Ethiopian integrity in the 1906 Tripartite Treaty should be thus interpreted : The status quo in Abyssinia should be preserved as long as may be possible and useful. In anticipation, however, of the fact that the situation might one day change, and to obviate in such an event a useless loss of time, a start was made on fixing the respective zones of influence. The first point, therefore, that should be discussed at the conference is that of ascertaining whether it is still possible and advantageous to consider the assumption of the status quo in Ethiopia as still valid.Affari Esteri states that in the forthcoming negotiations Italy intends to take into due consideration the interests of the Powers concerned. While France is believed to be ready to continue that friendly support to Italy which she manifested at Geneva, England&apos;s attitude, it is stated, appears still uncertain, and the article concludes : &apos;&apos; We ask nothing better than to be able to persuade ourselves that England is not defending in Abyssinia under the cloak of general principles her own particular interests; that she does not wish, for reasons of principle and of general policy, to suffocate every possibility of Italian expansion; and that she is not following, for reasons of domestic policy, a policy of regime. The coming negotiations will be the touchstone of the real intentions and the real policy of England. Let us hope that England will bring to them the same spirit that Italy will; that she will not take up a rigid position on questions of principle and prestige these are the most dangerous. Should this prove so, the reaching of an agreement will be neither difficult nor impossible, and, should it be wished, it will also be possible to register another victory for the League of Nations. Unfortunately, however, both in the attitude of the British Government as well as of the British press we seek in vain for signs which would lead us to hope. This is why we must sincerely confess that we cannot, even after the last Geneva meeting, give way to an easy optimism.&quot;
