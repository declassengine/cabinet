Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1935. SECRET. Copy No,CP. 177 (35).CABINET.FRENCH REQUEST FOR ASSURANCE REGARDING FUTURE BRITISH ATTITUDE IN THE EVENT OF A RESORT TO FORCE IN EUROPE OR OF AN INFRACTION OF THE COVENANT BY ANOTHER EUROPEAN POWER.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues herewith a copy of a telegram addressed to me at Geneva on the 10th September recording an interview which had taken place at the Foreign Office that afternoon between the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the French Ambassador, together with the text and translation of a memorandum which M. Corbin subsequently sent to Sir Robert Vansittart in confirmation of the questions he had put at their interview. As will be seen, the French Government by these representations, which, it will be noted, were made before my speech at Geneva on the 11th September, have asked for an assurance of the co-operation of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom in the event of an infraction of the Covenant or of a resort to force in Europe by another Power, whether or not that Power is a member of the League.M. Corbin has asked that this memorandum should be regarded as the notes which Sir R. Vansittart might himself have taken at their interview on the 10th September, and it should not therefore be regarded as a written, communication from the French Government.I hope to be in a position to submit the draft of the proposed reply to the French Ambassador to my colleagues at the meeting of the Cabinet on Tuesday, the 24th September.S.; H.Foreign Office, September 19, 1935.Document I.Sir R. Vansittart to Consul, Geneva. (No. 120.   Immediate.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, September 10, 1935.FOLLOWING from Sir R, Vansittart for Sir Samuel Hoare: &quot;The French Ambassador came to see me this afternoon urgently. He said he had a most important question to put to His Majesty&apos;s Government on behalf of the French Government, and it was one to which the latter would be grateful for a very early reply, as the answer to it would naturally enter into their estimate of the present situation. Moreover, the nature of the answer to the question might be raised soon in a very concrete form, of which he would give me an illustration later.&quot;He said that I would remember that during the last conversation which Mr. Eden and I had had with M. Laval in Paris he had asked us a question in regard to the future attitude of this country which he had not pressed at the time and had only asked tentatively and unofficially. M. Corbin said that he had now instructions to ask that question officially and in 8130   [12123]
Document II.Memorandum communicated by the French Ambassador to the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on September 10, 1935.(N.B. M. Corbin sent this memorandum to Sir R. Vansittart under cover of a letter, in which he described it as giving the substance of the questions he had come to put orally that afternoon, and asked that the document should be considered as the notes which Sir R. Vansittart might himself have taken in the course of the previous conversation.)SIR SAMUEL HOARE, au cours d&apos;un entretien avec TAmbassadeur de France, et Mr. Anthony Eden dans une conversation particuliere avec M. Pierre Laval, ont souleve des hypotheses qui conduisent le Gouvernement de la Republique a poser au Gouvernement britannique certaines questions auxquelles la situation presente conf ere une gravite particuliere.Au cas ou une evolution def avorable du conflit italo-ethiopien et une initiative militaire de 1&apos;Italie aboutiraient a une agression italienne caracterisee, le principal Secretaire d&apos;Etat de Sa Majeste pour les Affaires etrangeres a envisage 1&apos;obligation ou -se trouveraient les membres du Conseil de mettre en ceuvre 1&apos;article 16 du Pacte et, par Voie de consequence, 1&apos;application de sanctions immediates.II n&apos;est pas douteux que, dans une pareille eventualite, 1&apos;Ethiopie se trouvant, a tort pu a raispn, membre de la Societe des Nations, le Pacte serait juridiquement applicable. Dans les declarations qu&apos;il a faites a, Geneve, le 7 septembre dernier, M. Pierre Laval, President du Conseil, a. d&apos;ailleurs tenu a affirmer la fidelite de la France aux principes et aux. procedures du Covenant.   .II n&apos;en apparait que plus indispensable pour le Gouvernement de la Republique de savoir dans quelle mesure et sous quelles garanties il peut etreconcrete terms. The French: Government, in fact, wanted to know up to what, point and in what conditions would His Majesty&apos;s Government be prepared to apply sanctions and join in effective solidarity if the Covenant were violated by a recourse to force in Europe. M. Corbin said that this question;arose directly out of a conversation he had had with the Secretary of State in which the question,had emerged:of the situation which would arise in, this country if. in the Jtalo-Abyssinian: dispute negotiations: broke down.and the question of sanctions arose. M. Corbin said, that the. French Government had necessarily to take stock of the whole situation and in doing so must realise that the attitude of England had not hitherto, i.e., before the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, been strongly in favour of sanctions. It was essential for the French Government to know whether this attitude had changed, and if so, how far. Could the French Government in deciding their course in the present great difficulty, which might be pregnant with consequences for them, be sure that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be henceforth prepared to execute effectively its obligations under the Covenant if it was aggressively violated in Europe ? He said he would give me the illustration to which I have referred above. Germany, said M. Corbin, might perhaps be encouraged by Italy&apos;s example to attack Austria. Would His Majesty&apos;s Government in that case take the same attitude as regards sanctions as they were doing in the case of Abyssinia ?.:. &quot; I said that I would immediately report this conversation to the Secretary of State, but that as the exact wording to be employed in the question was a matter of considerable importance and as M. Corbin had hitherto only given me a description and resume- of his Government^ preoccupations and of the question itself, I would ask him to let me have that question in writing so that there might be no misunderstanding between us as to its exact wording. M. Corbin was, in fact, summarising a note in his conversation with me, and he promised to let me have the exact terms of the question to-night or to-morrow morning. And he left me with this promise and with the renewed observation that his Government would be glad of a very early answer, and that he felt sure that His Majesty&apos;s Government would appreciate the legitimacy and indeed the necessity of putting the question.&quot;
assure, pour. 1&apos;aveiiir, de la --solidarity immediate et effective de 1&apos;Angieterre en cas de violation du Pacte et de recours a la force en Europe; II y a la un element d&apos;appreciation d&apos;une importance toute particuliere&apos;- quand il s&apos;agit d&apos;un Etat qui occupe dans la politique europeenile une place aussi considerable que iItalic Le gouvernement franeais, qui serait place devant des responsabilites- tres complexes^ a le devoir de se preoccuper des consequences de fait qu&apos;ehtfairierait un recours a des sanctions. II est oblige de se demander si celles-ci n&apos;aboutiraient pas a aggraver et a etendre le conflit arme qu&apos;il n&apos;aura it pas ete possible d&apos;empecher.    vsx: J     --. &apos;.n v -&apos;1 ;&quot;&apos;-^rII est permis de rappeler que tandis que depuis 1921 la France a multiplie ses efforts pour mettre sur pied un systeme general et effectif d&apos;assistance mutuelle, le Gouvernement britannique ne s&apos;est pas toujours montre, dans le passe, anime des dispositions qu&apos;il manifeste aujourcFhui. Pendant la Conference du Desarmement egalement, le Gouvernement britannique a marque a diverses reprises qu&apos;il etait peu favorable a des engagements de securite collective. II comprendra done qu&apos;a 1&apos;heure actuelle le Gouvernement de la Republique soit dans 1&apos;obligation de se demander si les donnees de la politique ahglaise sont aujourd&apos;hui modifiees au point que nous soyons assures desormais de voir le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste, en toute hypothese et dans les memes conditions, pret a executer toujours d&apos;une maniere aussi effective en Europe les obligations qu&apos;il invoque aujourd&apos;hui.Apres avoir proclame dans la declaration du 11 deceinbre 1932 le principe du non-recours a la force en Europe, le Gouvernement britannique est-il dispose a preciser que, dans tous les cas ou serait constate un tel recours a la force de la part d&apos;un Etat europeen, membre ou non de la Societe des Nations, la Grande-Bretagne serait engagee a appliquer immediatement et effectivement a son endroit toutes les sanctions prevues par 1&apos;article 16? Si, par exemple, la mise en oeuvre de sanctions eventuelles contre lTtalie devait entrainer en Europe une extension du confiit dont 1&apos;Allemagne pourrait etre tentee de profiter pour realiser ses visees en Autriche, quelle serait 1&apos;attitude de la Grande-Bretagne? Srestimerait-elle tenue de donner a iindependance de PAutriche la garantie de fait qu&apos;elle lui a jusqu&apos;ici refusee ?Telles sont les questions sur lesquelles le Gouvernement de la Republique souhaite, a titre d&apos;information, etre renseignements le plus tot possible, pour se trouver en mesure d&apos;apprecier la situation actuelle, avec laquelle les eventualites qui precedent presentent un lien direct.Le 10 septembre 1935.(Translation.)Sir Samuel Hoare, in the course of a conversation with the French Ambassador, and Mr. Anthony Eden, in a private conversation with M. Pierre Laval, raised certain hypotheses which have led the French Government to put to the British Government certain questions which the present situation renders particularly weighty.If an unfavourable development of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute and a military initiative on the part of Italy were to end in a marked Italian aggression, His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has had in mind the obligation under. which the members of the Council would be&apos; to put into effect article 16 of the Covenant and, as a result, the application of immediate sanctions.It cannot be disputed that, in such a contingency, Ethiopia being, rightly or wrongly, a member of the League, the Covenant would be legally applicable. In the declaration which he made at Geneva on the 7th September last M. Pierre Laval, President of the Council, moreover, was careful to affirm the fidelity of France to the principles and to the procedure of the Covenant.It appears all the more essential therefore for the Government of the. Republic to know to what extent and under what guarantees it can be assured, in the future, of the immediate and effective co-operatiOh of Ehglarid&apos;in the case of a violation of the Covenant and of a resort to force in Europe. This information constitutes a particularly-important element in the appreciation of .a situation where a State is concerned which occupies so considerable a place; in European affairs as Italy. &apos; The French Government, which would be confronted
by very complicated responsibilities, is in duty bound to consider the effective consequences which would flow from a resort to sanctions. It is obliged to ask itself whether sanctions would not end by aggravating and extending the armed conflict which it would have proved impossible to prevent.It may be recalled that while from 1921 onwards France has repeatedly striven for the establishment of a general and effective system of military assistance, the British Government has not always, in the past, shown itself to be inspired by the tendencies which it displays to-day. During the Disarmament Conference, moreover, the British Government indicated on various occasions that it was not greatly in favour of undertakings of collective security. The British Government will understand, therefore, that at the present moment the French Government is compelled to ask itself if the basis of British policy has now been modified to such an extent that France can be certain henceforward of finding His Majesty&apos;s Government in every eventuality and under the same conditions invariably ready to carry out in an equally effective manner in Europe the obligations to which it appeals to-day.After having proclaimed, in&quot; the declaration of the 11th December, 1932, the principle of non-resort to force in Europe, is the British Government disposed to state definitely (&quot; preciser &quot;) that in every case where such a resort to force is established on the part of a European State, whether or not a member of the League, Great Britain would be bound to apply immediately and effectively, as regards the State concerned, all the sanctions laid down in article 16 ? If, for example, the application of any sanctions against Italy were to involve in Europe an extension of the conflict by which Germany might be tempted to profit in order to realise her aims in Austria, what would be the attitude of Great Britain ? Would Great Britain consider herself obliged to give to the independence of Austria the effective guarantee which she has hitherto refused to that country ?, , Such are the questions as to which the French Government would desire, for the purpose of information, to be enlightened as soon as possible, in order to be in a position to appreciate the existing situation, with which the above-mentioned eventualities are directly connected.o
