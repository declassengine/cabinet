Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1935.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 156 (35).CABINET.MALTA:  PROPOSED LEGISLATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Coloni-es.I WISH to ask for Cabinet approval to introduce next session a Bill to repeal the Malta Constitution Letters Patent.2. This proposal does not raise any issue which will be new to my colleagues. The question of our Malta policy was brought before the Cabinet by my predecessor on several occasions. I would invite reference in particular to CP, 110 (34) and CP. 244 (34) and the relevant Conclusions.* In the former-Paper, submitted in April 1934, the case for the abolition of the Island&apos;s Constitution is comprehensively set out; and I need not trouble my colleagues by recapitulating the arguments in detail.3. The Constitution, it will be recollected, was suspended in the autumn of 1933 in connection with the action which had to be taken against the growing pro-Italianism of the Nationalist Ministry. My predecessor in April 1934 intimated to the Cabinet that he agreed with the view which had been put forward by the Governor that it would be impossible to restore the Constitution in its old form, and that he agreed that on the local merits there was a strong case for abolition. But there were at that moment two difficulties in the way of immediate legislation. It was practically impossible to find the parliamentary time; and there was the obvious difficulty of introducing a Bill for the abolition of the Malta Constitution concurrently with the India Bill. These two difficulties should be out of the way by the beginning of the next session; and the course will then be clear for the introduction of a measure, which cannot, indeed, be much longer postponed, to deal with Malta.4. The existing situation in Malta may be briefly stated as follows : On the suspension of Parliamentary Government in 1933, the Governor took over the administration in virtue of a provision in the Constitution which empowers him to do so provided the Secretary of State is satisfied that a grave emergency exists. Under this provisional system the Government is still being carried on. As soon as the Imperial authorities took over, a series of measures was, as my colleagues may recollect, decided upon in order actively to combat the difficulties which had arisen owing to the increasing Italian propaganda in the Island. This policy has proved a marked success. The case for an Act of Parliament to enable the provisional to be transformed into a more permanent system of government is even stronger than it was at the time when my predecessor reviewed the situation in his memorandum alluded to above (CP. 110 (34)). The population as a whole appear to be not only content with, but also to welcome the present state of affairs. Except among a small clique of politicians who have a vested interest in the continuance of responsible government, there appears to be no real demand for the restoration of the Constitution.5. The present comparative content of the population is largely due to the fact that under the provisional administration if has been possible, on the* Cabinet 17 (34), Conclusion 8.

domestic side, to carry through properly planned schemes for development and for the improvement of the administration in the interests of the Island as a whole. Much more has been done in this direction than was achieved under responsible government. On the Imperial and international side, it has been possible to take measures against, and largely to control, the menace of pro-Italianism a control which, in a fortress like Malta, it is essential to maintain in the interests of Imperial defence. The Governor, whose views I in principle endorse, considers that it is essential to consolidate these achievements by setting up a more permanent form of government on the lines indicated in paragraph 9 below. To restore self-government is not at present practicable. The Constitution was suspended by Lord Passfield in 1930, and the present suspension is therefore the second one within three years. It has been proved by experience that the constitutional machinery set up in 1921 is top-heavy and in present circumstances at any rate unworkable. To reimpose it would throw the Island back into a state of petty politics and intrigue and lead to the victimiza-tion of people who have loyally supported us. Many commitments which the provisional Government has entered into for the welfare of the Island would be prejudiced. Schemes of administrative improvement which have been embarked upon, particularly in agriculture, would be in danger of being wrecked.6. There is a further point. Malta is an entirely Roman Catholic country; and it is necessary to face the fact that the influence of the Church there is all-powerful. The relations between the Governor and the ecclesiastical authorities during the provisional regime have been very friendly; and there is every reason for believing that, so long as Malta is administered as a Crown Colony, these good relations will continue, and that the Church, which has little to gain, and possibly much to lose, from the restoration of responsible government, will remain well-disposed to us. But if elections were held, it seems certain that the parish priests would throw their influence on to the side of the nationalist party, and that the result of the election would be the triumph of the pro-Italian party. The pendulum would then swing back quickly in a direction which would prove very threatening to our defence interests.7. From the legal standpoint I am advised that it may not be legally possible to carry on much longer the present temporary regime, which is based upon the largely fictitious assumption that a &quot; grave emergency &quot; exists in the Island. A case on the matter has, indeed, recently been raised by Lord Strickland impugning the validity of the present form of government. The local Court of First Instance and the Appeal Court have so far given judgments in favour of the Government. But it is understood that the matter will be taken by the appellants to the Privy Council, and there is always the possibility that the Judicial Committee might reverse the judgment of the local Courts. But this is a side issue. I put forward the case for legislation, as did my predecessor, not so much upon grounds of legal technicality as of the substantial necessity from the Imperial and domestic standpoints of putting the present form of government upon a more permanent basis as early as practicable.8. The matter cannot be dealt with except by an Act of Parliament; and I therefore ask for authority to bring forward the necessary Bill. The Bill, it is anticipated, will be a very short one of some three or four clauses. Its effect will he simply to repeal the existing Letters Patent and to validate, if that proves to be necessary, everything which has been done during the provisional regime.9. The question of the new form of government to be set up will not be dealt with in the Bill. That is a matter which will be settled by prerogative legislation as soon as the ground has been cleared by the repeal of the present Letters Patent. But the future form of government is clearly a matter which will be raised in Parliament during the discussions on the Bill. The matter has been under discussion with the Governor, and, although no detailed instruments have yet been drafted, the general view taken is that, while the supreme legislative and executive power should remain with the Governor, a Council should be set up to assist him. The present conception is that this Council should consist of officials and of unofficials nominated by the Governor, but I do not wish to be committed to any details yet, as I am anxious to have time to discuss these with the Governor when he has recovered from his present illness.
It may not be possible indefinitely to carry on without some form of elective institution, but there is a strong consensus of opinion that, after the vicissitudes of the last few years, the Island needs a rest from elections and political dissensions. The Council would be of an advisory and not legislative character; and the Governor, although he would consult it on all important matters, would not be bound to follow its advice. The inclusion of the unofficial element, which, in my view and in that of the Governor, is an essential part of the scheme, will enable the Governor to have at his disposal some formal and regular channel by which to come in contact with unofficial opinion. I also hope that it may enable him in some measure to reconcile local politicians to the new state of affairs by their being nominated on to the Council. It would also help to make the change more palatable to democratic opinion in this country.(Initialled) M. M.Colonial Office, Downing Street, July 24, 1935. *
