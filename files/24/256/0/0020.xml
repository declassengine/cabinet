Printed for the Cabinet,  July 1935.MOST SECRET. Copy No.Jto be kept under lock and key.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.COMMITTEE ON THE ORGANISATION OF THE COAL MININGINDUSTRY.Interim Report.ON the 8th May, 1935, the Cabinet decided (Cabinet 26 (35) Conclusion 4) :-That the President of the Board of Trade&apos;s Memoranda (C.P.-129 (34) and C.P.-77 (35)) should be considered in the first instance by a Committee composed as follows : The President of the Board of Trade (in the Chair). The Secretary of State for War.A representative of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Secretary for Mines.On the re-construction of the Government, the composition of the Committee was altered to include the Minister of Labour and the Minister without Portfolio.The. Committee has met twice and desires to submit an Interim Report to the Cabinet, as they feel that the broadest issues of principle must be decided before they are in a position to give detailed consideration to the questions raised by the Eeports of the Inter-Departmental Committee (CP. 129 (34) and OP. 77 (35)).Accordingly the Committee decided that this Interim Report should cover the whole ground of coal policy, should make clear why it is necessary to declare a coal policy, and should suggest to the Cabinet what that policy should be in each case.&quot;Reorganisation&quot; and Unification of Royalties.The Committee is the more impressed with the necessity for a decision on the points of policy because it appears likely that the Government will be faced before an election with a crisis in the affairs of the Coal Mines Reorganisation Commission.This Commission was established by Part II of the Coal Mines Act, 1930, with the following object: &apos;&apos; To further the reorganisation of the coal mining industry .... and for that purpose to promote and assist by the preparation of schemes and otherwise the amalgamation of undertakings consisting of or comprising coal mines, where such amalgamations appear to the Commission to be in the national interest.&quot;For two years the Commission confined themselves to trying to stimulate voluntary amalgamation.   The results were disappointing.  About thirty schemes have been effected, some with the help of the Commission and some without, but [11935] B
most of them are comparatively small. The Commission then fell back on the compulsory provisions of the Act, but the nature of their machinery makes progress extremely slow. The first case brought before the Railway and Canal Commission was recently rejected by that Court, and this has served to focus public attention on the Commission^ future. This scheme was not a full amalgamation and the Commission will put before the Court a scheme of a different nature, but it seems not unlikely that the Court may reject this also on grounds that would amount to a decision that the compulsory provisions of the Act were unworkable. The Cabinet Committee have had the advantage of hearing Sir Ernest Cowers, Chairman of the Reorganisation Commission, who pointed out that, if this happened, he and his colleagues could hardly avoid asking to be relieved of their duties.. In any case, the original appointments of the Commissioners expire next December, so that public attention will then be again focussed on this subject.It therefore seems inevitable that, at an early date, the Government will be in a position in which the alternatives before them will be either to repeal Part II of the Act of 1930 or to amend it to give the Commission further direct powers of compulsion. The latter course would, in the opinion of the Committee, be strongly opposed by Government supporters in both Houses of Parliament, while the former would be resisted by supporters of the Government sitting for mining and other labour constituencies, and would be a useful election cry for the Mineworkers&apos; Federation. The Committee have, therefore, considered whether these are really the only alternatives.This raises the fundamental question whether the Government is prepared to foster not necessarily by compulsion the policy of concentration in the coal-mining industry in spite of the fact that one of the first consequences of concentration must almost inevitably be an increase in the volume of unemploy-ment. For any step that can be taken to improve the organisation of the industry must have the effect, directly or indirectly, of concentrating output at the more efficient mines, with similar consequences as regards the numbers employed.But in-this connection it should be recalled that in their Report dated the 23rd April, 1934, the Inter-Departmental Committee said : &quot; (a) that if the policy were carried out to the fullest extent theoretically possible (a condition not realisable in practice), the number of men who might ultimately be displaced would not appear likely to exceed 100,000;*(b) that the total figure (whatever it may be) would only be reached graduallyover a period of years;(c) that  if  the   anticipated  improvement  in  the   industrial   situationmaterialises, the problem will be simplified; and(d) that if the process of displacement is gradual, it can be dealt with to aconsiderable extent by arrangements for the transfer of labour, restrictions on recruitment and similar measures. Work-sharing schemes might be helpful.&quot;The alternative to this policy (of concentration) is for the Government to face the disadvantage of abolishing the Coal Mines Reorganisation Commission and, at the same time, of resisting all attempts made by the industry to reorganise itself, but, if the Government accept a policy of concentration, we think that they should consider whether the unification of mining iwalties cannot be put forward by them as their contribution towards the reorganisation of the industry.The Committee were advised that undoubtedly one obstacle in the way of reorganisation is the multiplicity of royalty owners. For instance, it frequently emerges that the savings to be secured from the grouping of pits and the concentration of production on some pits would be outweighed by the dead-rents payable on the pits which would not be used, while in other cases special clauses in the leases requiring coal &quot;to be worked diligently&quot; interfere with the advantages to be secured by amalgamation. This view has been forcibly stated by the Reorganisation Commission on several occasions, notably in their Report of December 1933.   The point was stressed to the Committee by Sir Ernest* As some men on the colliery books are also registered as temporarily stopped, any increase in the number of unemployed, resulting directly from the displacement, would be less than the number &quot; displaced.&quot;
Gowers, who agreed that there are other difficulties, but said that even if these were removed, the royalties difficulty would remain an obstacle to reaping the fruits of amalgamation.Further, the Committee is informed that the private ownership of. royalties is a matter of constant grievance in the mining areas, and the removal of it is very-desirable on political as well as other grounds.On the other hand, it has been represented to the Committee that the nationalisation of royalties would set a precedent which might be very dangerous; that in a big strike the pressure on the Government to cancel the royalty payments and accept the interest on the stock as a charge on the Exchequer would be almost irresistible; that it would not be possible for the Government to adopt an impartial attitude during strikes in the mining industry; that it would cause difficulties in regard to subsidence damage and would discourage private enterprise and create political problems.Other members of the Committee feel that the scheme proposed possibly with some variations in detail would differ very little in political principle from such organisations as the Port of London Authority, the Central Electricity Board and the London Passenger Transport Board. They thought, judging from past experience, that the issues in any big strike would be too great to be susceptible of settlement by any concession in regard to royalty payments. They consider that there would be real advantages in unifying royalties.In this connection it is worth placing on record that the unification of royalties is recommended in his first report by Mr. P. M. Stewart, the Commissioner for the Special Areas (England and Wales), as well as in the earlier report by the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, and that certain Ministers have expressed their personal opinion as to its desirability, notably the Lord President of the Council (in a Broadcast speech on Saturday, the 5th January, 1935) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (in the House of Commons on the 21st December, 1934).Other aspects of Coal Policy.When the Committee found itself faced with the above issues of policy, and it became apparent that the Government would require in the not distant future to make a comprehensive announcement of their coal policy, the Secretary for Mines called attention to the fact that there were other coal matters on which decisions were needed, and in order that the whole of the issues might be before the Cabinet simultaneously, the Committee asked the Secretary for Mines to prepare statements on these other aspects for inclusion in the Committee&apos;s report, in spite of the fact that they are outside its terms of reference. The Committee has not considered, and expresses no opinion on, these other matters.(1) Wages.As part, no doubt, of a political campaign in anticipation of a general election, the Mineworkers&apos; Federation have recently asked for an all round compulsory increase in wages and for the setting up of national, as opposed to district, machinery for the discussion of wages between owners and men. As regards the first of these requests, they have been informed that the Government are not prepared to impose upon the coal industry alone an arbitrary standard of wages fixed without reference to the economic condition of that industry. As regards the second, it has been pointed out that, in view of the unfavourable attitude of the owners towards national wages machinery, there is no way of granting their request without the setting up of compulsory arbitration machinery, a proposal which has hitherto been found unacceptable to all concerned.(2) Safety Regulation in Coal Mines.For some years past there has been a steadily increasing pressure from organisations representing the miners and the subordinate mine officials, and also^ from Members of Parliament representing mining constituencies, for the overhaul and revision of the safety provisions in the Coal Mines Act, 1911. This Act, now 24 years old, was based on the Reports of a Royal Commission appointed [11935] B 2
in 1906. It superseded the previous general Act of 1887 (also based on the Reports of a Royal Commission), which in turn had superseded Acts of 1872 andl862.These recurrent demands have lately been reinforced by a Resolution passed at a Special Delegate Conference of the Mineworkers&apos; Federation, who followed it with a deputation to the Secretary for Mines to urge the Government to take early action. The Federation emphasised that their demand was for a new Act, and that they would not be satisfied with a repair of the existing Act by amendment; and in the course of the discussion the Secretary for Mines suggested -and they did not demur to the suggestion that a general revision of the existing safety legislation could hardly be undertaken without a comprehensive inquiry.The Federation have since submitted a reasoned statement in support of their Resolution, and are considered by the Secretary for Mines to have proved their case. Indeed, it is not difficult to make such a case, in view of the fact that the period since 1911 already as long as that between 1887 and 1911-has seen far more important and fundamental changes in the industry than did the previous quarter of a century. Examples of this are the introduction and rapid growth of machine-mining, which has radically changed the methods of winning and working coal; and the gradual linking up of single mines by companies owning groups of mines, which has tended to transfer to the owners and their agents responsibilities which legally rest on the manager.It is true that the Act of 1911 provided means for the amendment of certain of its safety provisions by General Regulations, and, in fact, important additions have thus been made from time to time, besides the other regulations which have had to be promulgated to keep the statutory requirements in touch with the growth of experience and technical knowledge. But there still remain issues of increasing importance which cannot thus be dealt with, and it is submitted that these require exhaustive inquiry by an authoritative body as a basis of any proposals for their solution.   Some of them are highly controversial.They involve in the main (a) the problems of general organisation of the industry with reference to matters of safety and health, and (b) the principles of management and supervision at individual mines or groups of mines. These problems should, in the opinion of the Secretary for Mines (and in accordance with precedent), be remitted to a Royal Commission other matters which require attention involve technical detail and are not well suited to such a means of inquiry; they can be better dealt with in other ways. Some of them have recently been, or still are, the subject of inquiry or research by expert bodies, and similar special inquiries could be instituted for other matters of this nature.Being, however, definitely of opinion that the time has come for the whole question of mine safety legislation to be thoroughly reviewed, the Secretary for Mines suggests the appointment of a Royal Commission for the purpose, with terms of reference limiting their inquiry, so far as practicable, to the principles of safety and to the general organisation which those principles involve, somewhat on the following lines : &quot; To consider whether the changes in organisation and methods of work, and the results of research into matters of safety, make it - desirable that the principles or general provisions of the Coal Mines Act, 1911, should be extended or modified, and to make recommendations.&quot;Attached to this memorandum is a short note on some of the specific matters of particular importance proposed for reference to the Commission (Appendix I).(3) Working Facilities The Consett Appeal Case.A recent (majority) decision of the Court of Appeal on a question of inter-pretation of Section 13 of the Mining Industry Act, 1926, has created a situation of great difficulty, which requires the consideration of the Government. The position created by this decision is summarised in a memorandum by the Secretary for Mines (Appendix II attached).As things are, it is possible for a mineral worker in Scotland to obtain relief from unduly onerous financial terms in an existing lease, but it is not possible for a mineral worker in England or Wales to do so. The Mining Industry is pressing for legislation to affirm the interpretation of the Act adopted by the Railway and Canal Commission in Scotland.
As will be seen from the last paragraph of the historical section: of Appendix II, the question is related to the general royalties problem. It is suggested that the Committee, if authorised to draft a Royalties Bill, should take into account the effect of the Consett decision.: Summary.Decisions are required on the following points : (1) Is the Government prepared to foster not necessarily by compulsion a policy of concentration in spite of the probable effect on numbers employed?   (Page 2.) (2) If so, is the Government prepared to approve the unification of Royaltiesin principle as its contribution to this policy?   (Page 2.)In this event it is suggested that the Committee should beauthorised, to prepare a detailed scheme, draft a Bill and open negotiations with representatives of the Royalty Owners. (3) Is the proposal of the Secretary for Mines that a Royal Commission beappointed to consider and report on matters of Health and Safety inthe Mining Industry approved ?   (Page 4.) (4) May the Committee be authorised to consider the relation of the Consettdecision to the royalties problem when drafting a Royalties Bill ?(Page 4.) &apos;The Committee suggest that any decisions on the above matters should be embodied in due course in a general announcement of Government policy in regard to coal.Signed on behalf of the Committee : .WALTER RUNCIMAN, Chairman.Board of Trade, July 26, 1935.I 11935 1
APPENDIX I.Safety Regulation in Coal Mines.Some matters proposed for reference to a Royal Commission.1. The principle of the Coal Mines Act is that of placing the &quot;control, management and direction &quot; of each mine in the hands of one person the Manager who must hold a Government certificate of competency.The principle of management.That principle has been followed for more than 50 years, but nowadays, with larger mines as units, often grouped together under one company and worked intensively for two or three shifts a day instead of one shift, the following questions arise : (a) Is it enough to have the Manager as the sole higher official whose appoint-ment is required by law; and are not other higher officials required at large mines or large groups of mines, e.g., under-managers and mechanical and electrical engineers ? Such appointments are, indeed, often made, but the law does not require them and some of them carry no statutory responsibility at all.(&amp;) Does the wide extent to which the Manager is responsible in law correspond with his real authority and responsibility in large under-takings where he is subject to the technical direction of a general mariager and an agent as well as the financial and other direction of the owners ?Safety officials.2. The chief subordinate safety official is the deputy : he must devote his whole time* to supervisory safety duties underground. The Act defines these safety duties in general terms, but in practice it is difficult to draw a strict or definite line between safety and output, or for the deputy to be dissociated entirely from any concern about the success or failure of his district and of the men in his charge in producing coal. The Act further provides that the size of the district in charge of each deputy (and the extent of any non-safety duties permissible) must be consistent with the thorough performance of his statutory safety duties; and that if any question arises on that point it is to be decided finally by the Divisional Inspector of Mines.A case has been put by the Deputies&apos; Federation with increasing force in support of their contention that, under stress of economic difficulty, these provisions for &quot; safety &quot; tend to be subordinated to &quot; output &quot; and &quot; economy.&quot; They contend that the fear and in certain cases prima facie the fact of victimization prevents the deputy in some cases (a) from reporting the true condition of his district as regards safety;(b) from using the machinery which the Act provides for limiting the size of the deputy&apos;s district and ensuring that he has time to do his safety work thoroughly.The evidence needs investigation.Inspections on behalf of the Workmen.3. The workmen at every mine have the statutory right to appoint at their own cost two persons to make independent inspection of the mine periodically on their behalf. That right is regularly, though by no means fully, exercised in the North of England and South Wales, but very little in other coal-fields. By common agreement such inspections are a valuable check and safety measure. How can they be developed and improved ? The Mine workers&apos; Federation ask that (as in France, for example) the Government should bear the cost or that the cost should be a charge on the industry, but if the Government is to take a hand* There are certain exceptions, but they do not affect the general argument.
APPENDIX II.Mining Industry Act, 1926, Section 13 (2). Consett Iron Company : Appeal Court Decision. . Memorandum by the Secretary for Mines.Introductory.THE Consett Iron Company applied last year to the Railway and Canal Commission, under the provisions of the Mines (Working Facilities and Support) Act, 1923, and the above Act, for a revision of certain surface wayleave rents which they pay under existing leases, on the ground that the onerous nature of these rents impeded the working of their coal in the most efficient and economical manner. The Court granted the application, and made an Order substantially reducing the rents. The Respondents appealed against this decision, on the ground that the word &apos; &quot;terms&apos;&apos; in the above Sub-section is confined to terms of a lease other than financial terms, and that, therefore, the Commission was acting ultra vires in reducing the amount of the rents. The Court of Appeal, by a majority, has allowed the appeal,* and under the provisions of Section 17 (5) of the Railway and Canal Traffic Act, 1888, this decision is final.The position created by this decision is one of considerable difficulty. The Railway and Canal Commission in Scotland, by their decision (per Lord Blackburn) in the Carron Company case in 1930, f interpreted Section 13 (2) as the Commission in England did in the Consett case; and so far as Scotland is concerned Lord Blackburn&apos;s interpretation continues to hold the field.   But for* Consett Iron Co., Ltd., v. Clavering Trustees and v. Towneley Trustees. Court of Appeal Judgment of the 15th March, 1935t Hope Morley v. Carron Co., December 1930.in the organisation or finance of a service of inspectors acting for the workmen, what are to be the relations between that service and the Government Inspection service? The question is complicated in certain coal-fields by disputes between rival Trades Unions in the election of &quot; workmen&apos;s inspectors.&quot;Government Inspection.4. There is a widespread and increasing call from the labour side for a large increase in the number of Government Inspectors-at present about 100. This raises acutely the question whether Government Inspection already frequent and extensive can be carried much farther without impairing the legal and moral responsibility of the owners and management. The standard of inspection has steadily been raised piecemeal there are more Inspectors for fewer mines and it is time the principles were examined.The Workman&apos;s Responsibility for his Own Safety.5. It is important that the industry should realize more clearly that the prevention of accidents is not only the responsibility of the owners and manage-ment not only a matter of supervision and material precautions governed by law and enforced by Government Inspection but very largely a matter also of the individual worker taking due care of his own safety in an occupation which, at best, will always be one of the most dangerous.The roots of effective action for the prevention of accidents in which this personal factor predominates are education of the worker and effective co-operation between management and workpeople. &quot; Safety Pit Committees&quot; are one medium for such co-operation, but they are unpopular in the mining industry, and other methods must be sought. Broadly speaking, all previous attempts to deal with this aspect of the problem in the mining industry have failed, but it is of such vital importance that a fresh effort should now be begun.
England and Wales it has now been established by the Court of Appeal that the Act of 1926 does not enable a mineral worker to obtain relief from any financial terms in an existing lease, however onerous.Historical.As Lord Justice Greer pointed out in his dissenting judgment in the Consett appeal case, the old Common Law right of the landowner to do what he liked with his own has frequently been overidden by statutes on grounds of public policy. It was after the law had already imposed important restrictions in other directions on landowners that the Act of 1923 was passed &quot;to make provisions for facilitating the working of minerals &amp;c.   In addition to enabling the recalcitrant landowner to be compelled, in the national interest, to allow his minerals to be worked, the Act also provided for the compulsory granting of such ancillary rights (surface and otherwise) as are necessary for such working; and empowered the Railway and Canal Commission, in default of agreement between the parties, to fix the amount of compensation or consideration for the rights so granted, on the basis of what would be fair and reasonable as between a willing grantor and a willing grantee.The Act of 1923 did not, however, give the Commission any power to interfere with or modify ancillary rights under agreements already in existence, so that a landowner who had not hitherto made any grant of rights might be compelled to grant them on fair terms; while his neighbour who had previously given a lease containing burdensome terms might continue to receive excessive payments from the mineral worker.It will be remembered that the Royal Commission of 1925 recommended the nationalisation of coal royalties as being preferable to a strengthening of the machinery of the Act of 1923. The Government were unable, however, to accept this recommendation, and proceeded instead to extend the scope of the Working Facilities legislation on the lines suggested by Sir Lewis Coward, a member of the Railway and Canal Commission, who gave evidence* before the Royal Commission.The Act of 1926.The Act of 1926 widened the scope of the Act of 1923 (and further restricted the freedom of the landowner) in two respects. First, it allowed any person to-apply for the right to work minerals (instead of only persons who already held an interest in the minerals, or in adjoining minerals). Secondly, it afforded the chance of relief to a mineowner who was already, by some existing agreement, suffering the unfair burden of what Lord Justice Greer compendiously calls &quot; dictated &quot; terms.Section 13 (2) of that Act is as follows :--&apos;&apos; Where the working of any coal, or the working of any coal in the most efficient and economical manner, is impeded by any restrictions, terms or conditions contained in a mining lease, or otherwise binding on the person entitled to work the coal, a right to work the coal freed wholly or partially from such restrictions or conditions, or to work the coal on other terms and conditions, may on an application for the purpose being made and referred to the Railway and Canal Commission under the principal Act, be granted by the Commission in any case where the Commission consider that it is expedient in the national interest that the right applied for should be granted to the applicant.&quot;Rather curiously, this further radical interference with private contractual rights excited little or no attention during the passage of the Bill through Parliament. The only specific criticism came from Lord Hartington during the-Committee Stage, and even he did not concentrate upon the important point which is now at issue. On his receiving an assurance in general terms from the Solicitor-General to the effect that the provision for compensation in the principal* Sir Lewis Coward, in recommending that the Court should be empowered to &quot; review or override terms or conditions contained in existing contracts,&quot; did not make it clear whether he. had in mind financial as well as other terms.
Act would equally apply in the case of any rights granted under this Sub-section, Lord Hartihgton professed himself satisfied (vide Official Eeport for the 13th July, 1926, Cols, 258-262). The question as to whether the expression &quot; terms&quot; in this Sub-section includes financial terms, and enables the Court actually to reduce royalty or other rents payable under existing agreements, was not specifically dealt with at all, and there is no direct evidence to show what the intention of Parliament was in this respect.Conclusion.The question now for decision is whether any, and if so what, action should be taken in the light of the Court of Appeal5s decision in the Consett case, and of the anomalous position thereby created as between England and Scotland. We have already received strong representations from the Mining Association, who are naturally very much concerned at the effect of the Consett decision, pending which other prospective applicants under Section 13 (2) have been holding their hand.*The main argument adduced by Lord Justice Slesser, in granting the appeal, was to the effect that when the Acts of 1923 and 1926 are read together, if all other rights conferred are to be the subject of compensation, then the right to be freed from an existing contractual obligation to pay a rent higher than the applicant desires to pay must itself be a right which should be the subject of compensation; and, if so, the Court, having taken something away with one hand, would be giving it back with the other which is clearly absurd. Therefore, to escape this absurdity, it must be concluded that financial terms of a lease are not included in the expression &quot; restriction, terms or conditions 55 in Section 13 (2) of the Act of 1926.Lord Justice Greer, in his dissenting judgment, said :  &quot; In my judgment, it is impossible to construe Section 13 (2) otherwise than as an interference with the landowners&apos; rights, subject only to such compensation as may be gathered from the incorporation in the Act of 1926 of the provisions of the Act of 1923. The Order of the Railway and Canal Commission, in my judgment, provided for the only compensation to which the landowner is entitled, by treating the provisions of the Act of 1923 as applying to the substituted rights granted to the mineowner under Section 13 (2) of the Act of 1926.5 5o* It should also bra remembered that the provisions of the Act of 1926 were, by the Mines (Working Facilities) Act, 1934, extended so as to cover the case of metalliferous minerals, as well as coal; and we understand that applications under Section 13 (2) are pending from that industry, too.
