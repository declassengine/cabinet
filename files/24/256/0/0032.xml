Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1935.SECRET. Copy No.   42CP. 172 (35).CABINET.THE ASSYRIAN QUESTION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE Assyrian problem has reached a stage when it has been necessary for the Chancellor of the Exchequer and myself to review the whole question of the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards it. I will not weary my colleagues with past history beyond recalling the tragic events of the summer of 1933 when Iraqi troops took savage reprisals, not only against certain armed Assyrians, who, having made an unauthorised exodus to Syria in search of a new home there, then recrossed into Iraq, but also against those Assyrians who had remained quiet and shown loyalty to the Iraqi State. Every competent observer has, without exception, agreed that these events have made it finally impossible for the Assyrians to remain permanently in Iraq and that they must be settled elsewhere in the very near future if further disaster is to be averted.2. The Council of the League of Nations in October 1933 set up a Special Committee of six of its members (Spain, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Denmark and Mexico) to tackle this question. The Committee has exerted every effort to find a suitable place of settlement, and has considered possibilities in every part of the world. Owing to generally unfavourable economic and social conditions and to the unwillingness of most countries to contemplate the influx of several thousand members of a little-known Asiatic race, it has now become obvious that there is no alternative to settlement in French mandated territory in Syria. Details regarding the prospects of settlement there are contained in the annexed memorandum (Annex A). The whole scheme now threatens to break down on the question of finance.j.3. The French Government only agreed to receive the Assyrians in Syria under strong pressure from the League Committee, with the informal independent backing of His Majesty&apos;s Government. Even then their agreement wTas subject to an assurance given by the Council of the League that the work would only be undertaken and carried out as and when sufficient funds were available, and that no financial obligation in respect of the capital expenditure involved by the proposed settlement operation, or in respect of the maintenance of the settlers until they become self-supporting, would be entailed either upon the French Government or upon the French mandated territories. The French Government have since receded a considerable distance from this attitude. They have agreed that the State of Lattakia, in which settlement is proposed, shall contribute a substantial sum (22 million francs, i.e., about  300,000) towards the preliminary development work, which of course is expected to benefit not merely the Assyrians but French Syria as a whole. Furthermore the French Government have recently informed His Majesty&apos;s Government that, in response to the general appeal for funds made by the League Assyrian Committee (to which reference is made below) they contemplate making available for Assyrian settlement certain funds repaid to them out of a previous Armenian settlement scheme. The amount of these funds is not at present clear, but may be as much as  40,000. Even so, apart from these French contributions, it is obvious that a sum, possibly as much as  800,000 must be found by the Assyrian Committee without delay if the Assyrian8112   [12071] b
scheme is not to break down. The Committee is doing its&apos; best either to obtain reductions in the estimates on which the present French figure of  800,000 is based, or to devise some means whereby the original capital outlay by the Committee may be reduced. So far, however, these efforts have been fruitless and there is little hope of success at all events until the French Government have a clearer indication of the amounts actually likely to be subscribed.4. The main responsibility for providing the money must, of course, lie with the Iraqis, and from the first every effort has been made to obtain from them the maximum possible contribution. It is true that Iraq has, at present, no national debt, and that she has considerable financial resources. At the same time, the Iraqi Government have their own political and parliamentary difficulties. They have from the first taken the line that they cannot pay the full amount of any settlement scheme, and for a long time they let it be generally understood that they neither would nor could pay more than  100,000. Public opinion in Iraq regards the Ass3^ria.ns as an alien population, or, alternatively, as rebels. The Iraqis consider that the Assyrian problem was foisted upon them by the British Government, under whose auspices the Assyrians were brought into Iraq during the war. Moreover, the fact that the Assyrians have been (and are still) employed by His Majesty&apos;s Government as troops in Iraq have added to their unpopularity and intensified the Iraqi conviction that the Assyrian problem is essentially a British one. The Iraqis have, nevertheless, already spent a great dead on the Assyrians. They have maintained a large refugee camp for nearly two years; they have helped those Assyrians who could be induced to return to their villages, with money, implements, cattle, seed, &amp;c.; and in 1934 they paid  10,000 to the French in return for the provisional settlement in Syria of the relatives of a number of Assyrians who had been interned there since the original trouble. Nevertheless, as a result of strong pressure from the President of the League Committee, supported by Flis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Bagdad, they agreed in May of this year to contribute  125,000 towards the present scheme of Assyrian resettlement. When Nuri Pasha, the Iraqi Foreign Minister, was recently in this country I did all I could to persuade him to get this sum increased. I made a proposal that, supposing the French estimate could somehow be reduced to, say,  500,000, the Iraqi Government should then pay half. Nuri Pasha did not appear personally to regard this as out of the question. Indeed, before he left London he said that he had telegraphed to Bagdad accordingly. While indicating that he expected no change in his Government&apos;s attitude in the absence of fresh developments, he sent me a private message to the effect that he would do his best to persuade his colleagues to try to get a larger grant from the Iraqi Parliament, if and when it could be shown that a slightly increased contribution from Iraq would turn the scale. Since, then the League Committee has appealed to the Iraqi Government to double their contribution. The reply of the Iraqi Government does not finally close the door, but shows that there is little likelihood of a larger Iraqi contribution until the Iraqi Government see some sign of a serious effort in other quarters to provide funds. They will definitely not pay the whole amount required, whatever the possible consequences may be.5. The present problem is to bridge the gap between the Iraqi contribution and the cost of any practicable scheme. In 1933, as a result of a Cabinet decision of the 15th November of that year, His Majesty&apos;s Government let it be known that in their view the cost of any Assyrian settlement scheme, apart from what the Iraqi Government and the Assyrians themselves might pay, should be borne by the League itself, and that, while His Majesty&apos;s Government were therefore unable to contemplate an individual payment, they would pay their share of a League contribution. Unfortunately, it is now clear that there is practically no chance of a general League contribution, so long at all events as His Majesty&apos;s Government make no independent contribution, if only for the reason that all the other members of the League are convinced that an immeasurably greater responsibility falls on His Majesty&apos;s Government than on themselves. Moreover, ,a League contribution requires a vote of the Assembly, and a debate in the Assembly in existing circumstances would only result in acrimonious controversy, ion the past history of the Assyrian question and the relative responsibilities of the parties concerned, i.e., the Iraqis, the League and His Majesty&apos;s Government, for which the time is, at this of all moments, emphatically not appropriate. The League Committee, besides appealing to the Iraqi Government to double their
contribution, has renewed an appeal previously addressed by the Council to individual members of the League and to private organisations. But, for the reasons which I have just explained, this appeal is not likely to have any appreciable result. On the other hand, the Committee, with the abstention of the United Kingdom representative, has addressed an urgent and special appeal to His Majesty&apos;s Government, on purely practical grounds and without reference to the question of responsibility, to make an individual contribution. The texts of the Committee&apos;s appeals to His Majesty&apos;s Government and to the States members of the League are attached as annexes B and C. The previous appeal of the Council to individual Governments led to no result, and there is no reason to suppose that the present appeal will have a better fate. The whole situation now depends, in fact, on the reply which His Majesty&apos;s Government return to the Committee&apos;s specific appeal to them.6. After a full review of the whole situation, I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that there is no hope of further progress unless His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment depart from their previously declared attitude and give a definite lead in the shape of an independent contribution. Unless this lead is given, I am convinced that the whole scheme will break down.7 His Majesty s Government cannot afford in their own interests to allow the scheme to fail, or even to be delayed, so far as it lies with them to prevent delay. AH competent observers, including Sir Francis Humphrys, the local British officials, independent American missionaries, representatives of charitable societies, and, more recently, the representatives of the League Committee who have lately visited Iraq, agree that if the Assyrians are not removed from Iraq and resettled elsewhere very soon, an acutely dangerous situation will arise. The Assyrians have now waited for a solution of the problem for nearly two years since the massacres and looting of 1933. The situation, meanwhile, has been one of continual anxiety; two schemes of settlement have already broken down (in Brazil and British Guiana respectively), and on each occasion great efforts have been necessary to prevent untoward consequences. The Assyrians now know that the Syrian scheme is physically practicable, and that the necessary land is available. They expect that the move will begin this autumn. If their hopes were again disappointed it is difficult to see how a fresh clash between them and the Iraqis could be averted.8. Prophecies are seldom infallible, and to be alarmist is seldom to be convincing; but it is unusual to have so strong a consensus of opinion from local experts as we have in the present case as to the acute danger of the local situation. Unless further progress with the settlement scheme can be made before the coming winter sets in, there is a serious possibility of some act of folly on the part of the Assyrians as a whole or at least of some hot-headed members of the community, which might lead to reprisals and far-reaching results. It would need only a small spark to bring about a conflict between them and the Kurds, who constitute the majority of the population of Northern Iraq, and still owe only a loose allegiance to Bagdad. Many of the Kurds feel that they should have had much more loot from the. troubles of 1933. Moreover, these troubles were within an ace of involving the more numerous, prosperous and defenceless Chaldeans and other Christian minorities of the north, and this danger will be present in any further outbreak, although, since these minorities have tranquilly accepted their lot in Iraq, the question of their safety does not normally arise. Any trouble in the north would inevitably be the signal for a revival of the Shiah trouble on the Middle Euphrates, which has only been imperfectly suppressed. The Iraqi army might thus be divided and the north left defenceless, while disturbances in Northern Iraq might well lead to either Turkish or Persian intervention, in view of the distribution of the Kurds between Turkey, Persia and Iraq. The possibility that the help of His Majesty&apos;s Government might be invoked under the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance of 1930 cannot therefore be excluded. But even if the troubles remained purely internal, His Majesty&apos;s Government would find it impossible to avoid entanglement. Apart from the strong feeling which would be aroused in this country by further anti-Christian excesses, His Majesty&apos;s Government could scarcely, as a member of the Council of the League, remain indifferent to what was going on, and, with the means of intervention at hand in the shape of the Royal Air Force, they might find themselves compelled to choose [12071] b 2
between humiliating inactivity and an active intervention, which, in the opinion of competent observers, would result in an outburst of fanaticism and frenzy in which the lives not only of the minorities but of British and other European residents would be endangered. Even if matters did not go so far, fresh disturbances would endanger important British material interests, such as the oil wells of Kirkuk and the Kirkuk-Haifa pipe-line, and even the security of the Royal Air Force establishments themselves. It is thus no exaggeration to say that the outbreak of further serious trouble and the development of anarchy in Northern Iraq, which may easily follow from failure or delay to settle the Assyrian problem, may involve His Majesty&apos;s Government in an almost unlimited liability. In my view &quot;It is, therefore, important for His Majesty&apos;s Government  if only as a form of insurance against far heavier potential liabilities to make every&apos; possible effort to prevent the present scheme of Assyrian settlement from breaking down.9. Apart from the Iraqi Government, it is His Majesty&apos;s Government who have the greatest material interest in the early settlement of this question. Moreover, the contention that, with the exception of the Iraqi Government, His Majesty&apos;s Government bear the greatest moral responsibility for the settlement of the question is one which cold reason will never succeed in refuting in the face of the sincere, and sometimes passionate, conviction which is widely held to the contrary. There is no doubt that British prestige has been damaged by this question, but that it may be re-established by a lead in its solution. The more familiar arguments relating to the part played by the Assyrians in the war, and to the hopes held out from time to time by the British Government of the settie-ment of the Assyrians in conditions acceptable to themselves can, no doubt, be met. But there is force in the contention that the Assyrian difficulty ought to have been more clearly foreseen, and provided against, by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment before the termination in 1932 of the mandatory regime in Iraq, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government have an especial obligation to the Assyrians on account of their service in the levies, whereby His Majesty&apos;s Government have been able to economise in the use of British troops and have thus effected considerable savings.10. In the light of the foregoing the Chancellor of the Exchequer and I have considered the policy to be pursued. We do not suggest that His Majesty&apos;s Government should admit that they are primarily responsible for ensuring the success of the scheme. Such a course would be open to many objections, even were it practicable. We feel, however, that an independent contribution by His Majesty&apos;s Government should in certain circumstances be made, and that it is in fact inevitable. A decision regarding the actual amount of such a contribution cannot be reached at this stage when there are so many uncertain factors, but in view of the urgency of the matter, we have felt that some announcement of the readiness of His Majesty&apos;s Government in principle to make a limited independent contribution, subject to certain conditions, could not safely be delayed. Not only are there signs of renewed agitation regarding the Assyrians in this country (it was with difficulty that I secured the postponement of a debate on the subject in the House of Lords before the Recess), but the question is almost bound to come up for discussion both at the Council and at the Assembly of the League during the coming month. It seems essential, if any progress is to be made there, that we should enter into prior discussions with both the French and Iraqi Governments to induce the former to come to some arrangement whereby the capital sum to be found by the Assyrian Committee will be substantially reduced, and the latter to increase their offer. We cannot do this if our hands are empty. We have felt therefore that we should be interpreting the wishes of our colleagues in letting it be known that in certain circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to recommend Parliament to make an independent contribution, and in using this fact as a lever vis-a-vis not only of the Iraqi and French Govern-ments, but of the League and charitable organisations, with a view to the inauguration of a scheme of collective action within the framework of the League, in which the burden would be adjusted in proportion to the interests involved. With the concurrence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, I have accordingly approached the French and Iraqi Governments, as my colleagues will see from the attached copies of a note to the French Charge dAffaires, and of two telegrams to. His Majesty&apos;s Charge dAffaires at Bagdad (Annexes D, E and F).
11. These communications will make it clear that any contribution by His Majesty&apos;s Government must in general be subject to the elaboration of a satis-fa,factory scheme of settlement and to reasonable assurances tha,t the funds forth-coming from other sources, when combined with the contribution from this country, will be sufficient to ensure the success of such a scheme. It will be seen that we propose still to insist on the collective responsibility of the League and to urge that the League itself shall make as large a contribution as possible; and that we have expressed the opinion that Parliament is unlikely in any event to authorise a larger contribution by this country than that which the Iraqi Government may make. -   -12. I am convinced that the above policy gives the best chance of settling this question in a manner creditable to all concerned, but in the absence of an independent contribution by this country I see no hope of a solution and little hope of averting a situation which would involve His Majesty&apos;s Government in incalculable political and financial liabilities.13. As part of a satisfactory scheme, the Chancellor and I consider that His Majesty&apos;s Government should make an independent contribution up to a maximum of  250,000. There is no question at this stage of committing His Majesty&apos;s Government to any definite figure, but the necessity for announcing that His Majesty&apos;s Government will ask Parliament for a grant of that amount may rapidly arise at Geneva, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer and I trust that our colleagues in the Cabinet will concur generally in the line of action which we have already been obliged to initiate and which we propose to follow in the ensuing negotiations.S.

ANNEX A.Note on the Proposed Settlement of the Assyrians in Syria.A certain number of Assyrians from Iraq have already been provisionally settled on the upper Khabur River in North-East Syria. This settlement consists of men interned in Syria at the time of the 1933 troubles, together with their relatives, and a certain limited number of other necessitous Assyrians whom the French have from time to time agreed to receive, pending some more general scheme of settlement, and against certain payments by the Iraqi Government.2. The French resisted all idea of permanent Assyrian settlement in Syria until it became clear that there was no other alternative and the dangers of possible repercussions in the French mandated territories of any failure to settle the Assyrian problem in Iraq had been impressed upon them. They eventually yielded, subject, however, to an assurance given by the Council of the League that the work should only be undertaken and carried out as and when sufficient funds were available, and that no financial obligation in respect of the capital expen-diture involved by the proposed settlement operation or in respect of the maintenance of the settlers until they became self-supporting should be entailed either upon the French Government or upon the French mandated territories.3. For various reasons, partly economic, partly political, it is most undesir-able to settle the Assyrians permanently in that part of Syria where the present provisional settlement is situated. The scheme now proposed is for their settlement on the slopes of the Jebel Ansariyeh and on the Gharb Plain astride the River Orontes in the State of Lattakia. This scheme is generally known as the Gharb scheme and&apos; involves a considerable amount of development work (drainage and irrigation). Pending the completion of this development work, which will require three or four years, the intention of the French Government is to settle the Assyrians provisionally either in the neighbourhood of the Gharb area or in the present provisional settlement on the upper Khabur River. It is proposed that the Assyrians shall so far as possible themselves provide the labour for the development work in the Gharb area.4. The advantages of the Gharb scheme over others suggested by the French are that the Assyrians would, have Christian minorities as their neighbours and would be remote from both the Turkish and Iraqi frontiers. The political risks involved in their re-settlement would thus be reduced to a minimum, while the economic future of the Gharb area appears to be promising. The climatic con-ditions are also far more favourable in this area, which is near the Mediterranean seaboard, than in the Khabur basin, which is surrounded by desert. The difficulty is money. The Gharb scheme does not appear to be likely to be more costly than any other scheme in Syria, but its cost is surprisingly high. The cost of the development work is estimated at 62 million francs, of which, however, in spite of the stipulation originally made by the French Government, the State of Lattakia is now prepared to bear 22 million francs, leaving 40 million francs for the Committee to find. To this must be added the expenses of settlement proper (i.e., the construction of villages, the equipment of the Assyrians with seed, implements and live-stock and their maintenance until they become self-supporting). These settlement expenses are estimated by the French Government to amount to 20 million francs for 15,000 persons. The total to be found by the committee, according to present French estimate and assuming the number of Assyrian immigrants to be limited to 15,000 would thus be 60 million francs ( 800,000).5. That estimate does not make allowance for any payments or ultimate reimbursements by the Assyrian settlers themselves. On the other hand, it is possible that a greater number than 15,000 Assyrians, on which the present estimate is based, may have to be transferred. Also the possibility of a claim by the French Government for the refund of the cost of the existing provisional settlement on the Khabur, over and above the contributions made &quot;by the Iraqi Government, cannot be ruled out. It would therefore be imprudent to count upon a cost of less than  S00,000, and the actual sum to be found may even exceed this figure.
6. No final plan can be drawn up until the number of Assyrians to be trans-ferred has been definitely established. This can only be done by individual consultation of the Assyrians under proper safeguards, and the committee feels unable to take the responsibility of proceeding to this consultation until a definite and financially assured plan can be laid before the Assyrians, and until the latter can therefore be informed that if they elect to leave Iraq arrangements will be made for them to do so.7. In these circumstances, the Council Committee has decided, without waiting further, to appeal for funds. Against an estimated minimum expendi-ture or  800,000, it has so far only an offer from the Iraqi Government of  125,000, on the basis of  10 a head for every Assyrian transferred up to a maximum of 12,500 persons. For Assyrians above this number, the Iraqi Government have so far declined to pay anything, but in addition to their offer of a maximum of  125,000 they are willing to pay the expenses of transport within Iraq.8. The Council Committee on the 13th July made a fresh appeal to the Iraqi Government to double their contribution. At the same time, the committee issued a general appeal for contributions to all States members of the League, asking these States at the same time to bring the appeal bo the notice of any private organisations within their territories who might be in a position to contribute financially to the scheme. Finally, the president of the committee, in the name of all its members other than the United Kingdom representative, addressed a special appeal to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to reconsider their decision to contribute only as part of a League contribution.9. The members of the committee are convinced that there are at present, at all events, insuperable difficulties in the way of a League contribution. They have also examined the possibility of a League loan, but are advised that there is no prospect of raising such a loan at all events unless the rather doubtful security of the ultimate reimbursement by the Assyrians of the capital sum spent on their settlement should be reinforced by a Government guarantee or by the joint and several guarantees of financially powerful members of the League.Eastern Department, Foreign Office, August 1, 1935.ANNEX B. [E 4304/2/93] -M. Olivdn to Sir Samuel Hoare. (Received July 15.)Sir, Geneva, July 13, 1935.THE Committee of the Council for the Settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq feels that the stage has now been reached in its work where no further progress is possible until it has some more definite assurance than at present that sufficient funds for carrying out the settlement will in fact be available.You will have already received from the Secretary-General an appeal for funds for this purpose which the committee has addressed to all members of the League, reinforcing that issued by the Council on the 19th January, 1934. The members of the committee other than the United Kingdom representative have thought it necessary to address in addition to the United Kingdom Government this separate letter expressing views with which the United Kingdom representative is naturally unable to associate himself.The Secretary-General&apos;s letter will have informed you of the present position. The committee has decided to work for a scheme of settlement in the Gharb area in Syria; the cost of settling 15,000 persons in that area (without making allowance for eventual repayment by the settlers, the principle of which has since been accepted by the committee) was estimated by the French authorities during the recent visit to Syria of the president of the committee at not less than . 800,000.   Against this sum, the committee has no more than a promise of
 125,000 from the Iraqi Government, of which  60,000 has already been paid The committee has been informed by the French representative that some reduction in the above-quoted estimate may be expected, owing to changed circumstances since the original calculations relating to the development work in the area were made some years ago. Furthermore, reductions in the cost of settlement, as opposed to that of development, may naturally be anticipated in the course of detailed discussions, when various elements which cannot at present be properly appreciated are taken into account. Similarly, the United Kingdom Government will have observed that the committee is urging the Iraqi Government to augment the sum which it has already promised. But even taking into account the possibility both of reductions in the total sum required and of a larger Iraqi contribution, it is clear that there will in any case be a considerable balance to meet; and it appears from the presidents visit to Iraq that a greater number than 15,000 Assyrians may have to be transferred, which would counterbalance to some extent the anticipated reductions referred to above.Apart from the promise of the Iraqi Government, the only offer received has been that from the United Kingdom Government at an early stage of the committee&apos;s proceedings, to the effect that it was willing to pay its share of a League contribution, though it could only contemplate payment as part of a League scheme.We fully appreciate the reasons why the United Kingdom Government was not prepared at that stage to make a separate contribution, and our present appeal is based on purely practical grounds. The committee finds itself in an impasse. Although we cannot prejudge the decision that the Assembly might take if it were seized of the question of a possible League contribution for this purpose, we cannot refrain from expressing our-personal view that the practical difficulties in the way of such a contribution would be insuperable. At the request of the United Kingdom representative, we have considered the possibility of arranging a loan under League auspices and we have been convinced that no such course is practicable. In the circumstances, we have been obliged to fall back upon the expedient of renewing the Council&apos;s general appeal to ad members of the League for individual State contributions, although lack of response to the Council&apos;s previous appeal does not encourage us to hope for important results.We see no prospect in fact of finding a satisfactory solution of the problem with which the committee is faced, unless the United Kingdom is prepared to reconsider its previously declared attitude and to make an independent and substantial contribution in response to this fresh appeal. We feel, indeed, that without a substantial contribution from the United Kingdom Government no adequate solution of our problem is possible and we consider ourselves justified in appealing to the United Kingdom Government in the conviction that it is anxious to see the problem solved and cannot remain indifferent to the consequences of the failure of our endeavours.We appreciate that, without the more precise details which the committee is taking steps to obtain by further discussions at Beirut, it may be difficult for the United Kingdom Government to decide upon a definite sum. We trust, however, that the absence at this stage of a scheme complete in all its details will not prevent the United Kingdom Government, in the event of its deciding to-respond favourably to our appeal, from giving an indication of the amount which it is prepared to contribute.It will be realised that no final scheme can be established until the Assyrians have been individually consulted as to their desire to leave Iraq and the committee cannot take the responsibility of authorising that consultation without being sure that a substantial proportion of the final expense will be forthcoming.I have, &amp;c.J. LOPEZ OLIVAN, President, for the Committee of the Council for the Settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq.
ANNEX - 0.(C.L.118.1935.VII.)League of Nations :: Settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq.Appeal by the Committee of the Council. (Received in Foreign Office,&apos; July 18, 1935.)AT the request of the Committee of the Council for the Settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq, the Secretary-General has the honour to address to the Govern-ments of the members of the League the following communication, in which the committee, referring to the Council&apos;s resolution of the 19th January, 1934, makes an appeal for funds for the financing of the proposed settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq in the French-mandated territories of the Levant: It will be remembered that the Council of the League, at its meeting of the 17th April, 1935, approved the attitude of the Committee for the Settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq in relation to the possibilities of settlement in Syria, and authorised the journey of the chairman of the committee to Syria and Iraq, which, it was felt, would be likely to facilitate negotiations and to contribute effectively to the realisation of a plan of settlement.The chairman of the committee and the secretary of the committee duly proceeded to Beirut, where they had preliminary discussions with the High Commissioner of the French Republic for the Mandated Territories of the Levant. They then went to Bagdad, and, after establishing contact there with the Prime Minister of Iraq, they had the opportunity of visiting Mosul and many Assyrian villages in the north of Iraq. Further discussions with the Iraqi Government followed in Bagdad, as a result of which the Iraqi Government offered a contribu-tion of  125,000 towards the realisation of a scheme of settlement in Syria. This contribution was calculated on the basis of  10 for every Assyrian who might elect to leave Iraq up to a maximum of 12,500 persons.Subsequently, when the mission had returned to Beirut, it was arranged with the Iraqi Government that the latter should make an advance of  60,000, and that part of this sum should be utilised for the immediate transfer to the Khabur region of Syria, where a provisional settlement of over 2,000 Iraqi Assyrians is already in being, of some 1,400 of the more necessitous of the Assyrians in the Mosul area. This preliminary operation has since been completed. The persons transferred included the inmates of the Mosul refugee camp, which has thus now ceased to exist.From the report which the chairman has now presented to the committee and which will be circulated to all the members of the League, two important conclusions appear. On the one hand, the mission is convinced by its conversa-tions with Assyrian spokesmen that a greater number of Assyrians may wish to leave Iraq than can be accommodated in the Khabur area; on the other hand, a visit to the two areas in question has confirmed the mission in the belief that the Gharb area possesses in any case important political and economic advantages. The discussions which the mission conducted in Beirut have resulted in important modifications of the Gharb scheme as originally put forward by the French Government, and, as these modifications go far to remove the difficulties which had originally appeared to preclude the adoption of the scheme, the committee has now decided to direct its efforts henceforth towards settlement in the Gharb^ rather than in the Khabur, area. It has informed the French Government accordingly and proposed the immediate elaboration of a detailed plan by means of discussions in Beirut between the services of the French High Commission and technical representatives of the committee.It is, of course, impossible to produce a final plan without consulting the Assyrians individually regarding their desire to go to Syria, but the committee feels that it cannot take the responsibility of authorising such a consultation at the present stage. The commitee has, in fact, reached the conclusion that no further material progress can be made until it has some more definite assurance than at present that sufficient funds for carrying out a settlement scheme will be available.[E-&apos;M09/2/93][12071]c
According to estimates provided by the French authorities during the visit of the mission to Syria, the settlement of 15,000 persons in the Gharb area (including the necessary outlay for the draining and irrigation of the land) may cost as much as  800,000. This figure does not make allowance for ultimate repayment by the settlers, the principle of which has since been accepted by the committee. It is true, also, that the French representative on the committee has informed it that the above estimate was based in part on calculations made some years ago, and that closer estimates at the present date may be expected to result in a fairly considerable reduction. On the other hand, any reduction may be counterbalanced by the fact that a greater number of Assyrians may elect to leave Iraq than was contemplated when the figure of  800,000 was quoted, so that the committee thinks it prudent still to regard this figure as the sum which may be necessary to finance the operation. Against this it has so far only the promise of  125,000 from the Iraqi Government, of which, as stated above,  60,000 has actually been paid.Faced with this serious problem, the committee has decided in the first place to urge the Iraqi Government substantially to increase its contribution, and a reasoned note to this end has been addressed to the Iraqi Government.It is clear, however, that, even taking into account the possibility of reduc-tions in the existing estimates and of an increased Iraqi contribution, a considerable balance will remain to be found.In its resolution of the 19th January, 1934, the Council of the League, fore-seeing such a situation, issued a general appeal &apos;&apos; to the generosity of Governments and private organisations to consider participating in the financing of a settlement scheme, having regard more especially to its humanitarian aspect.&quot;The&apos;failure of the project for settling in Syria those Assyrians who may wish to leave Iraq would be attended by serious risks which it is in the interests of all members of the League to avoid. The committee feels bound, therefore, to recall to each individual Government the above-quoted appeal by the Council and to request that Government to inform the Secretary-General as soon as possible whether and to what extent it is prepared to contribute to this work of appeasement and humanity.The committee trusts that each Government will also take steps to bring this appeal to the notice of any private organisations within its territory which might be in a position to assist financially in the solution of the question.Geneva, July 16, 1935.ANNEX D. I&quot;E 5164/2/93j -Sir Samuel Hoare to M. Corbin. Your Excellency, Foreign Office, August 29, 1935.I HAVE the honour to acknowledge with thanks the receipt of the memorandum communicated to me by M. Cambon on the 22nd August, in which he was good enough to inform me of the action which the French Government propose to take in response to the appeal addressed by the Assyrian Committee of the Council of the League to all States members of the League, with a view to obtaining their financial participation in the proposed scheme for Assyrian settlement in Syria. I feel sure that the proposed action will be widely appreciated.2. In that memorandum he enquired what reply His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom proposed to return to the special appeal addressed to them by the president of the Assyrian Committee on the 13th July.3. Your Excellency is no doubt aware that His Majesty&apos;s Government have hitherto maintained that the financing of any Assyrian settlement scheme, apart from the contributions of the Iraqi Government and of the Assyrians themselves, should be a collective responsibility on the part of the League as a whole, and that while His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to pay their share of a League contribution, they could not contemplate any independent financial participation. His Majesty&apos;s Government still adhere to their view regarding the collective responsibility of the League, but I am happy to be able to tell you,
[e 5164/2/93] ANNEX e.Cypher Telegram to Mr. Bateman (Bagdad).(No. 214.) Foreign Office, August 28, 1935.MY telegram No. 166 of 26th June : Assyrian question.Consideration has now been given to the attitude to be adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government towards the appeal addressed to them by president of Assyrian Committee to make independent contribution towards Assyrian settlement.   His Majesty&apos;s Government must still adhere to their view as to the for the strictly confidential information of the French Government at this stage, that they are now. prepared, on purely practical grounds, to reconsider in certain circumstances their attitude towards an independent contribution. They still consider that the League should itself make as large a contribution as possible, but they are disposed in principle to recommend Parliament to authorise a limited independent contribution, subject to the elaboration of a satisfactory scheme of settlement, and to there being a reasonable prospect that funds will be forth-coming from other sources, including the League, which, when added to the contribution of this country, will be sufficient to ensure the success of the scheme.4. It is difficult to speak of precise figures at a time when the number of Assyrians to be transferred from Iraq is yet unknown, and then the details of the settlement scheme are still being worked out. It would, however, in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, be impossible in any event to obtain the necessary parliamentary sanction for a greater independent contribution by this country than that which might be made by Iraq.5. His Majesty&apos;s Government take the view that the Iraqi Government should make a considerably increased contribution, and they are about to approach that Government with this end in view! But the gap to be bridged between any contribution likely to be offered by the Iraqi Government and the total estimated cost of the Gharb scheme is unfortunately so wide that it seems unlikely that any sum which His Majesty&apos;s Government might be in a position to offer on the above basis would be sufficient to ensure success. Before further material progress can be made, therefore, it seems essential to work out a financial plan which, by taking into account all the factors involved, will reduce the problem to practicable proportions. His Majesty&apos;s Government sincerely trust that the conversations which have just taken place at Beirut may have assisted in this direction, but such information as they possess regarding those conversa-tions leads them to doubt whether a sufficient degree of progress has, in fact, been achieved on this point, valuable as the conversations have certainly been in many ways.6. His Majesty&apos;s Government believe that the success of the proposed scheme of settlement is of great mutual importance to Great Britain and to France, in view of the fact that the consequences of further Assyrian troubles might be serious for both countries. They desire, therefore, to suggest that in the light of the discussions at Beirut the position should be frankly explored at a very early date in informal discussions between representatives of the two countries, with the object of discovering some mutually satisfactory modus operandi which might be proposed, either to the Assyrian Committee, or to,the League Council. The most convenient place and opportunity for such discussions appears to be Geneva in the early stages of the coining session of the Council. These discussions might well be conducted in the first place between the United Kingdom and French representatives on the Assyrian Committee, and as the questions at issue would be largely of a technical and financial nature, His Majesty&apos;s Government, on their side, would be prepared to depute a Treasury expert to collaborate with the United Kingdom representative.7. I should be grateful if you &quot;would be good enough to inform me as soon as possible whether the French Government are willing to agree to this procedure.I have, &amp;c.SAMUEL HO ARE.
collective responsibility of the League for financing the scheme apart from the contributions of the Iraqi Government and of the Assyrians themselves. But on purely practical grounds they are now prepared in certain circumstances to contemplate a limited independent contribution. Though no exact figure can be fixed at this stage, His Majesty&apos;s Government could not hope in any event to obtain from Parliament a larger contribution than that which may be made by the Iraqi Government. His Majesty&apos;s Government would also require to be satisfied that the scheme of settlement is satisfactory in itself, and that the funds forthcoming from other sources, when combined with their own contribution, will be sufficient to ensure the success of the scheme. At the present moment the estimated cost of settlement is 82 million francs, of which some 22 million francs would be found by the State of Lattakia, leaving 60 million to be found by the Assyrian Committee. His Majesty&apos;s Government see little prospect of so large a sum being raised by the Assyrian Committee, but they hope that the amount may be susceptible of reduction. Before a final decision is reached by His Majesty&apos;s Government they propose to enter into informal discussions with the French Government with this end in view. They also propose at a later stage to urge that the League shall make as large a contribution as possible, and it may be that something may be forthcoming from charitable sources.2. You may inform the Iraqi Prime Minister and Nuri Pasha in the strictest confidence of the position as described above. While there are still many uncertain factors, it is clear that a contribution of  125,000 from the Iraqi Government and a similar contribution from His Majesty&apos;s Government will not suffice to ensure the success of the scheme. You may inform the two Iraqi Ministers that if the Iraqi Government will agree to increase their contribution, I am prepared to recommend His Majesty&apos;s Government to invite Parliament to authorise a corresponding contribution within certain limits, on a pound for pound basis, subject always to the general proviso, mentioned above, that a satisfactory scheme of settlement is elaborated and there is reasonable assurance that the remainder of the money required will be forthcoming.3. In reply to an enquiry from the French Government regarding the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government, I am about to propose discussions of the type contemplated in paragraph 1 of this telegram between French and United Kingdom representatives and technical experts at Geneva during the early part of the forthcoming Council meeting. I do not know whether Yasin Pasha is himself intending to be at Geneva at that time, but it would be convenient if the proposal contained in &quot;the preceding paragraph could be further discussed with him if he is there and /or with Nuri Pasha, who I understand hopes to be in Geneva when the Council meets on the 4th September.ANNEX F. [E 5164/2/93]--Cypher telegram to Mr. Bateman [Bagdad).(No. 215.) Foreign Office, August 28, 1935.MY immediately preceding telegram of 28th August: Assyrian question,, paragraph 2.It may be useful for you to have for your personal information and guidance only an indication of the limit of any independent contribution by this country. His Majesty&apos;s Government must not at this stage be committed to any figure,, but Chancellor of Exchequer and I are prepared as part of a satisfactory settle-ment to recommend a maximum contribution of  250,000. You will see from my telegram No. 166 of 26th June that I told Nuri Pasha on 24th June that in certain circumstances I thought the Iraqi Government ought to pay this amount, and he did hot appear to regard the proposal as out of the question. You will no doubt take an opportunity of reminding him of this.o
