3. The SuD-noTTritt.ee on Defence Policy and Requirements has held four Feetinge, rowely, on. August 23rd,  September. 5th,  11th. and 1.7th.    Tf. addition, the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee and the Chief.? of Staff individually have prepared a number of Reports for the Defence Policy and Require--*onts Commit t ee .SI^UA^^O^:4. In order to appreciate the various measures and dispositions which have been taken since the Cabinet Meeting of August 22nd, it will be desirable to recapitu-late very briefly the course vhich event? have taken since that date.5. The Cabinet Meeting was summoned as a result, of the breakdown of the &quot;Dsris Conversation.&quot;&apos;  of August 16th -18th, and in preparation for the Meeting of the League Council, which began on September 4th and is still in s es 91 on .6. Up to the present the Italians have maintained a completely r.or-poasumus a11.it.ud.e towards all  suggestions for a compromise solution which have been proposed, at Geneva.    On. the other hand,  they have assented to the appointment of a Committee of Conciliation constituted as follows:-. y.r Eden, V. Laval,Colonel Peck fPoland), Sen or Madariaga ( Spain), V. Aras (Turkey).This Committee of the League Council has completed itsReport, which has bear, handed by the Chairman t o the two parties to the dispute.as a basis of negotiation,The League Assembly began its Meetings onSeptember llth .i,!\
7. -&quot;&quot;he situation at Geneva remains fluid.    If all efforts to secure a peaceful settlement fail, and hostIll-tie? break exit., the question of sanctions must arise, but may take some time to arrange.8. Abyssinia is at present considering the question of mobilisation .    Their defective c ormvuni ca t ions make mobilisation a process which must be spread over a considerable time;    and they are unwilling to expose themselves to the dangers  involved by undue delay in the Initial step.   IT is Majesty,&apos;s Government have declined to express any opinion in the matter.9. Mean-while the Italian forces  in Lritrea andItalian Somaliland have teen gradually built up to a. total estimated at  185,000 men,  and this  Is  constantly being increased.    It is estimated that a further 88,000 men are&apos;under orders s,rd en route.    Approximately 300 aircraft have heen concentrated in these territories.   forces have also been sent to Libya and the situation there is being watched,   (see also paragraph 10).10. On September 10th Signor Mussolini proclaimedthe surrponing at an early date of a general assembly ofthe Italian forces.    On September 14-th    after a meetingof his Cabinet, he issued a  communique reaffirming &quot;in the&quot;most explicit manner that the Italo-ythiopian problem does&quot;not admit of a compromise solution after the immense&quot;efforts and sacritlces made by Italy ^hecommunique&apos; aIso contained statements  &quot;that the who 1 e of&quot;the military, naval and air forces are such as to be able&quot;to reply to any threat, whatsoever, from wherever it may&quot;come&quot;, and that &quot;in view of the unrest manifested by certain&quot;native exiles  of Cyrenaica,  our defences in Libya are now&quot;being reinforced.&quot; .    nhe communique was drafted, in a mannerintended to placate French opinion.11.    mhe Italians have taken anti-submarine and other defensive measures in the Sicilian ports and-3-
also at Leghorn.      Under the pretext of being driven in by rough weather&apos;s Italian auxiliary war vessels have paid visits of inspection to a number of Greek harbourss in-cluding the Piraeus., Havarino and Corfu.      Italian surface   : and submarine craft have also been despatched to the Red Sea.lid. Italian propaganda has been active in Malta $ Egypt and Palestine.      In Malta it Las become necessary to enact an Ordinance against seditious propaganda.      In Egypt , also5 there is an active Italian propaganda and the attitude of King Fuad and his Government is obscure.      Egypt contains an Italian population of some 65 9000.      The situation is being carefully watched by the Foreign Office and War Office.11 -     DEFENCE POLICY IN TEE PRESENT SITUATION.13.  It will be recalled that at the Cabinet meeting on the jdidnd august the instructions to the Delegates of the United Kingdom at the Geneva meetings included the following:-(b) That they should keep in step with the policy of the French Governments and more parti-cularly in the matter of Sanctions, they should avoid any commitment which France was not equally prepared to assume;(c) That they should have authority to make our policy in these respects clear at such time and on such, occasion as they might deem to be best;(d) That they should aim at following closely the procedure laid down in the Covenant (with the interpretations adopted by the Assembly in 19^1) not in any quixotic spirit, and with due regard to the many difficulties. They should be careful to avoid trying to force nations to go further than they were willing5, and generally should make it clear that the question of Sanctions was one which the Members of the&quot;League had to examine in co-operations and with a view to collective action.      They should be on their guard against the possibility that other nations might not in practice fulfil their commitments;
VAC *i -I l)(e) That if war should, break, out &quot;between Italy and Abyssinia bringing the Council to the stage where Sanctions had to be considered, the United Kingdom Delegates should he particularly careful to keep in touch with Ministers in London.14.  On 5th September the Sub-Committee on DefencefurtherPolicy and Requirements adopted the following/precautionsto safeguard our position in the event of Sanctions:-(a) That, amid the general desire to accomplish something effective at Geneva, we must be on our guard against the adoption of any form of economic or other sanctions which might turn Italian resentment especially strongly against this country and even &quot;be made a. pretext for an attack on ourselves alone. It was suggested that a prohibition of imports from Italy would hardly hit France at all but would have an appreciable effect on this country.(h) That,  in order to provide a safeguard against the risk of such an attack, the adoption of Sanctions must be made conditional on a clear understanding that if Italy, as a consequence, should attack any of the nations concerned, all the participating nations will declare war on Italy.      It was recognised that, while . this would provide us with a safeguard it would also involve a possible commitment.(c) That,  in particular, as a condition of the acceptance of Sanctions, we must have a clear understanding with France as to the action she will take in the event of an Italian attack on the interests of the United Kingdom; also,  if possible, with Yugoslavia and Greece.(d) That,  so far as at present can be  judged,the right moment for raising the question with France -would be if and when the Council of the League (probably through- a Committee)  taxz.es up-the examination of Sanctions.15.  The above decisions show that the Sab-Committeehas had to envisage the possibility that the discussion of sanctions at the League of Nations might at some stage leadto an aggression by Italy against this country.      the resulting situation has been examined, under two alternativehypotheses:-(a) That this country becomes involved in a war with Italy in co-operation with other Members of the League of Nations:
(b) That this country becomes involved in a single-handed war with Italy, he risk of . -/ this latter contingency is now considered by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs to be much less than it was.He considers it safe to assume that in any emergencyFrance would be with us.      M. Laval has made it quite clear that if Italy was to attach us France would supporthi-    as. .      -i .16.  In either hypothesis the Sub-Committee have laid it down that all plans affecting the Mediterranean should be based on the policy that Malta will in no circumstances be abandoned without every effort being made to defend it, unless the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee should advise that our general objectives in a hypothetical war would be frustrated by the defence of Malta.      The Chiefs of Staff have since stated that they do not anticipate that the defence of Malta would be likely to have such adverse effects.17.   In the case of a League war, the Sub-Committee have assumed that France would give us whole-hearted co-operation and would play the principal naval role in the western Mediterranean, except in the Gibraltar area, and the principal air role in northern Italy in which/ however, a contingent of British Air Force would co-operate.      Importance is also attached to co-operation by Yugoslavia and Greece as explained below.      It is assumed that the United Kingdom will play the principal role in the eastern Mediterranean.18.   In the ease of both hypotheses the Sub-Committee have accepted that in order to maintain naval control in the central Mediterranean it will he necessary
for &apos;lihe British navy to make use of a temporary &quot;base of operations referred to as Fort &quot;X&quot;.      This Port is on the Greek mainland and Greek co-operation to the extent of not preventing its use is very important.      The Foreign Secretary has informed the Sub-Committee that it may be assumed that Greece would have to co-operate.19.  The Sub-Committee decided that before any Sanctions are agreed to a clear understanding should be reached with the nations concerned on all the above points.      In present circumstances, however, the Sub-Committee    consider       that it is not desirable to enter into formal negotiations with other countries as to the precise action to be taken in the event of an Italian aggression,  though the Minister for League of Nations Affairs has been asked to avail himself of any opportunity which may offer to improve the position.      Meanwhile,  there is no objection to the Admiralty exchanging information as to emergency arrangements informally with the French navy through, the Naval Attache in Paris, xeeping in touch,  of course, with the Foreign Office.
III.    DaMSIVS MEASURES TAKEN.20.    The principal dispositions of the armed forces -which have been authorised are as follows :-Naval Dispositions.21,    (a) The Mediterranean Fleet (except       destroyerflotillas and submarines for the local defenceof Malta) has left Malta and is now in theEastern Mediterranean.

A division of Destroyers from China is on the way there, and a division of destroyers from the Mediterranean Fleet has also been despatched to the Red Sea.(d) It will be recalled that the cabinet at their Meeting on 22nd August9  decided that the Admiralty should be authorised to arrange for
the Home Fleet to concentrate at Portland on 29th August and to &quot;proceed south to the Mediterranean, the Cabinet favouring Gibraltar rather than Malta as its destination.      The Bub-Committee decided,, on 23rd August,  that the Home Fleet  should remain at Portland until further instructions were -  issued.      As already mentioned, the battle cruisers HOOD and RENOWN accompanied by three cruisers and some destroyers have since been sent to Gibraltar.The Home Fleet fully manned, leas the various units mentioned above,  and with the addition of two flotillas of destroyers and the 3rd S/M Flotillas from reserve and other sources, remains at Portland pending other instructions.(e) Two cruisers and an aircraft  carrier from the China Squadron have been moved to Singapore,(f) The ships, equipment and personnel constituting the Mobile Naval Base Defence Organisation,with attached Army A/A formations, have been sent to Alexandria and await orders.

These installations have been increased by the hire of some commercial tankage at port Sudan, Suez and Port Said,(1)      The question of diversion of British shipping has been discussed with the Board of Trade.    The Admiralty are making the necessary preliminary preparations to enable control and routeing of British shipping to he instituted if an emergency arises that necessitates diversion of through Mediterranean trade to the Cape Route,,(m)       Preparations have been made to enable staffs to be organised at Aden, Port Said and Gibraltar for the establishment of Control of Contraband destined for Italy or Eritrea should such a measure be demandede
