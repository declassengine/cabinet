SECRET. CTPT179(S5).COPY NOCABINET.FRENCH REQUEST FOR ASSURANCE REGARDING FUTURE BRITISH ATTITUDE IN THE EVENT OF A RESORT TO FORCE IN EUROPE OR OF AM&apos; INFRACTION OF THE COVENANT BY ANOTHER EUROPEAN POWER.Draft of a Note in reply to the French Ambassador^ (Reference CEP. 177(55)),FOREIGN OFFICE,S.W.l. september,  1955 *Your Excellency5In the enquiry which you were so good as to address to Sir Robert Vansittart on September 10th Your Excellency expressed the desire of your Government, in connection with the present dispute between Italy and Abyssinia, to learn to what extent they might be assured in the future of the immediate and effective co-operation of this country in the event of a violation of the Covenant of the League of Nations and a resort to force in Europe;   and you referred in particular to the eventuality of a resort to force in Europe on the part of some European State9 wirether or not that State might be a Member of the League of Nationse2o     I have the honour, in reply, to invite your atten-tion to the words which I used in the course of my speech to the League Assembly at Geneva on September lltho     I then declared that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United. Kingdom would be second to none in their intention to fulfil, within the measure of their capacity, the obligations which the Covenant lays upon them;   and I added that the Ideas enshrined in the Covenant., and in particular the aspiration to establish the rule of law in international affairs, had appealed with growing force to the strain of idealism in the British national character, and thatthey..HisExcellencyMonsieur Andre Charles Corbinc
2athey had indeed become a part of the national conscience.5.     As Your Excellency will also recollect, I further took the opportunity in the course of my speech at Geneva to repudiate any suggestion that the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government had heen one of other than unwavering fidelity to the League and all that it stands for, and I drew attention to the fact that the recent response of public opinion in this country showed how Completely the nation supported the Government in the full acceptance of the obligations of League membership, which was the oft proclaimed keynote of British foreign policy.     I added that to suggest or insinuate that this policy was for some reason peculiar to the Italo-Abyssinian conflict would be a. complete misunderstanding. Nothing could in fact be further from the truth.     I said, and I sincerely welcome this opportunity to repeat with full responsibility, that it is to the principles of the League,, and not to any particular manifestation thereof, that the British nation had demonstrated its adherence.     Any other view would at once be an underestimate of British good faith and an imputation upon British sincerity.     In conformity with its precise and explicit obligations I pointed out, and I re-emphasise, that the League stands, and this country stands with it, for the collective maintenance of the Covenant in its entirely, and^particularly for steady and, collective resistance to all acts of unprovoked aggression.
4.     I would draw Your -Excellences particular attention to this last sentence;    for I think it will &quot;be generally-agreed that no member of the League could lay down its policy with greater clarity and decision in advance of any particular case which would &quot;bring that policy into consideration, as in the present case, with all its fellow members at Geneva.     Your Excellency will observe that 1 spoke, as I am now writing, of all acts of unprovoked aggression.     Each word in that s entence must have its full valueo     It is at once evident, for example, that not only may there be degrees of culpability as there are degree of aggression, but also that procedure which would be appropriate as regards the positive act of unprovoked aggression would not necessarily he appropriate as regards the negative act of the failure to fulfil the terms of a treaty.     I understand that your Government already rsoognxsu these distinctions.     And similarly in regard to treaty obligations it is pertinent to recall that, as I have already said at Geneva, elasticity is a part of security? and that every Member of the League must recognise, as the Covenant itself recognises, that the world is not static.5,     If it be suggested that this declaration of support for the principles of the Covenant embodied in my recent speech at Geneva, and reaffirmed in the present note re-presents only the policy of His Majesty&apos;s present Government, and not necessarily that of their successors in office, I may point out that, while my words at Geneva were in fact spoken on behalf of the present Government of this country,those,o.o
4,those words were also spoken with the overwhelming support and approval of the British nation..      As I stated at Geneva, and as has since become increasingly evident, the attitude of the British nation in the last few weeks has clearly demonstrated the fact that it is moved by no variable and unreliable sentiment but is concerned with a general principle of international conduct to which it will firmly hold, so long as the League remains an effective body,      His Majesty1s Government believe that an organism which, in the considered opinion of this nation, represents the one and only real hope of avoiding the senseless disastrous-ters of the past and ensuring world-peace by collective security in the future, will not lightly render itself impotent by lack of faith in, and refusal of effective action on behalf of, its own ideals.     But that faith and that action must, like the security, be collective,,     The point is so vital a&amp;d I must venture, in conclusion, once more to quote my words at Geneva,    &quot;If risks for peace are to be run they must be run by all&quot;.     So long as the league preserves itself by its own example, this Government and this nation-will live up to its full principlessI have the honour to be,with the highest consideration,Your Excellency&apos;s obedient servant,
