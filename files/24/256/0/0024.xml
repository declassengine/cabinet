Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1935.MOST SECRET . :  Copy no cp. 164 (35).CABINET.THE ATLANTIC AIR ROUTE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.1. THE Inter-departmental Committee on International Air Communications, under the Chairmanship of Sir Warren Fisher, has, during the past two months, devoted a great deal of time to the consideration of problems in connection with the development of trans-Atlantic air services.2. Up to date, apart from certain Continental services, our Civil air develop-ment has been directed entirely to the establishment of Imperial air communica-tions. Great progress has been made in this direction, and a far-reaching scheme for the further improvement of these services, by giving increased frequency and increased speed, has recently been approved by the Government, who have also accepted the principle that these services shall, from 1937, carry the whole of first-class mail without surcharge.3. Satisfactory though these developments have been, they have taken place in the Imperial field where we are free from any severe competition, although it is true that the French and the Dutch are to some extent competing with us on the route to India and beyond.4. The truly international field, in which there is every indication of severe competition for world-wide supremacy in the air, has had perforce to wait, and the committee takes the view that we can no longer afford to stand aside and watch other nations develop this field. In this connection I might draw attention to the air services which have been established by France and Germany between Europe and South America, in which, so far, Great Britain has taken no part; also to the services established by Pan-American Airways from the United States to South America via our West Indian Colonies; also to the efforts which are being made by France, U.S.A., and other countries to establish services between the US.A- and Europe.5. The Committee has taken the view, and I think rightly, that in considering these international routes we should give priority to the establishment, as early as possible, of services between the U.S.A. and the United Kingdom, as this is obviously a route which is destined in the comparatively near future to carry a very large amount of traffic, and has great political value. From&quot; the Empire point of view this also completes the projected scheme by the inclusion of Canada.6. With this object in view the Committee have recommended to me that immediate action should be taken to provide the equipment necessary for this service and to press forward the ground organisation, including wireless and meteorological facilities, necessary for its safety and success. I have endorsed these recommendations, and I hope that as a result of intensive effort by all concerned, we shall be in a position to undertake some experimental flights in 1936, and to inaugurate a regular service by the late summer of 1937.7. I also hope that it will be possible to send representatives of the Air Ministry and the General Post Office to Canada and the U.S.A. in the autumn of this year to carry out negotiations with the Canadian and US.A. Governments, with [12036]       ^ B
a view to coming to agreement as to operation. &apos; The position in this respect may be briefly summarised as follows   ------- -----......... - -..............-(a) In the matter of mails the IIS.A. has the advantage in that their Post - &quot;j Office controls the routing of some 85 per cent, of the mails going east-wards to Europe. The British Post Office, on the other hand, controls the routing of only some 30 per cent, of the mails going westward to North America.(6) Against this commercial asset we have the geographical advantage of the possession of Newfoundland on the northern route (as well as Bermuda on the southern), on which territory a, base can be established which will materially reduce the passage of the Atlantic as compared with a direct crossing from the U.S.A. to Ireland. Technical officers from the Air Ministry are now in Newfoundland with the object of selecting a suitable base.8. The question of a terminal base in Ireland has not yet been decided. There are two alternatives, viz., a base in Northern Ireland, or a base in the Irish Free State. No survey has yet been undertaken to decide which is the more suitable location from the technical point of view. A base in Northern Ireland would have the advantage of being under our complete control. On the other hand, it would leave the territory of the Irish Free State open to exploitation by all other nations desirous of participating in this trans-Atlantic service. It is obvious that such a service at the outset will be a most expensive undertaking, having in view the fact that it involves a direct sea crossing of approximately 2,000 miles by the shortest route. The Committee, therefore, takes the view that international competition on this route should be avoided if possible, and that carriage of such traffic as is available should be limited to the national companies of the United Kingdom and the U.S.A., viz., Imperial Airways Limited and Pan-American Airways. This object would be much more difficult to achieve if the Irish Free State were to be left as an open door. The Committee, therefore, felt that if a satisfactory arrange-ment could be reached with the Government of the Irish Free State, it would be preferable to establish the trans-Atlantic base in that territory rather than in Northern Ireland.9. An opportunity occurred at the beginning of this month to open up discussions with the Irish Free State Government on this matter. This oppor-tunity arose out of negotiations which had been taking place between a United Kingdom air transport company and the Irish Free State Government in regard to the operation of services between the Irish Free State and Great Britain. These negotiations gave us a chance of suggesting to the Irish Free State Government that Colonel Shelmerdine, the Director-General of Civil Aviation, should proceed to Dublin to discuss the matter. It was also suggested that he should discuss questions arising out of the future institution of a trans-Atlantic air service.10. These discussions (of which I attach a note) took place on the 29th and 30th July with encouraging results, which can.be briefly summarised as follows : The Irish Free State Government would be ready to co-operate with the United Kingdom Government in the establishment of a base in Galway, or elsewhere on the v/est coast of Ireland, provided that such a base, with all its installations, should remain in the ownership of the Irish Free State Govern-ment, and provided also that the Irish Free State national air transport company now to be formed could have a financial interest in Imperial Airways, or any subsidiary company of Imperial Airways to which may be entrusted the operation of the trans-Atlantic service.11. If agreement on these lines can be reached,, the Irish Free State Government will agree to limit the use of the base for the purpose of trans-Atlantic operation to companies (of whatever country) jointly approved for the purpose by the Irish Free State Government and the United Kingdom Government. This would virtually give us control.12. An agreement on these lines, if it can be reached, offers such far-reaching advantages that I think the matter should be pursued as speedily as possible. With complete control of air bases in Newfoundland and Ireland, we should be
in a dominant position in regard to trans-Atlantic traffic over this route, and this would place us in a very favourable position in regard to Our future negotiations with the U.S.A. In fact, the advantages of such an agreement appear to me to be almost incalculable.13. I am bringing this matter to the notice.of my colleagues, because I feel that they should be aware of the important developments taking place, and because I also feel that I should have their acquiescence and support in the steps which I am taking.14. I must make it clear that no trans-Atlantic service can be operated without a very substantial subsidy, and, further, that if a base is to be established in the Irish Free State we shall have to assist very materially in the expenditure involved. I would, therefore, seek my colleagues&apos; agreement in the following main principles : (1) That the subsidy necessary for the operation of the trans-Atlantic route shall be provided.(2) That negotiations with the Irish Free State Government should be pressed forward.(3) That financial assistance, in a form to be decided later, towards the provision of a base in the Irish Free State should be given.P. C.-L.August 16, 1935.427011/35.Visit of Lieutenant-Colonel F. C. Shelmerdine, Director-General of Civil Aviation, to Dublin on 29th and SOth July, 1935.1. I visited Dublin on the 29th and 30th July for the purpose of discussing with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (1) The institution of air services between the Irish Free State and Great Britain, and(2) Questions arising out of the future institution of a trans-Atlantic air service.This report deals with Item No. (2).2. Discussions started at 11 a.m. on the 29th July in the office of Mr. J. Leydon, Secretary, Department of Industry and Commerce, and lasted throughout the day. There was also present Mr. J. P. Walshe, Secretary, Department of External Affairs.The first question to be discussed was Item No. (1) above, on which a separate report is being made.3. As regards Item (2), I recalled the Committee on Trans-Atlantic Air Services, which sat at Ottawa in 1932, and on which Mr. Lemass and Mr. Walshe represented the Irish Free State. I then briefly outlined the measures which we were taking on the technical side to secure the earliest possible inauguration of a regular trans-Atlantic service, and I pointed out that it was necessary to reach an early decision as to the location of a base on the West Coast of Ireland as the terminal point of the trans-Atlantic crossing. We had to decide whether that base should be in Northern Ireland or in the Irish Free State. I said that I was aware that a survey had been carried out by Sir Alan Cobham, acting on behalf of Mr, C. PL Clendining, of Galway Harbour, with a view to the establishment of a base there, and I had seen a copy of his report. Apart from this, we had no information and had not ourselves carried out a survey of any sort.I made this quite clear because I thought that I detected a lurking suspicion that we had only approached the Irish Free State, having ourselves exhausted the possibilities of Northern Ireland in this connection.4.   The Irish Free State representatives said that their Government was anxious to take the fullest possible advantage of the geographical position of their country in connection with plans for the development of trans-Atlantic air services.  They thought that such services would eventually be of great assistance [12026] b 2
in the development of the country, bringing tourist and other traffic and providing employment. Incidentally, they mentioned the possibility of the establishment of an aircraft factory somewhere on the west coast. They thought that from the point of view of immunity of attack from the air the west coast of Ireland had considerable advantages.5. They said that the Irish Free State Government would be very ready to co-operate to the fullest extent with the United Kingdom Government if it should prove that a suitable site for a base could be found on the west coast, either at Galway or elsewhere. They realised that up to date they had done nothing to develop air transport, and that they were only now making a start with an Irish National company to operate services between the Irish Free State and Great Britain. They would have to look to us for technical and operational advice.6. The conditions under which they would be prepared to co-operate with us in this project were broadly that (a) The Irish Free State should retain the ownership of the base, complete with all installations, to be established in that country; and(&amp;) That the Irish Free State National operating company should have a financial interest in the company which is to operate the trans-Atlantic services, i.e., in Imperial Airways, Ltd., or a subsidiary company. So far as they were concerned, this company would have complete freedom technically and operationally.7. They indicated that they realised their responsibilities to Canada under the Ottawa Agreement and would wish to have the fullest consultation and co-operation with Canada as well as with ourselves.They suggested that their preference would be for an operating company in which Imperial Airways, or a subsidiary companjr, Canadian Airways and the Irish Free State National company, should each have an equal holding.At the same time, they made it clear that they could not afford to develop a base which might cost anything up to  1,000,000, or to contribute to a subsidy for operation.I said that I did not think that any such arrangement as they indicated would be possible, though I did not rule out the possibility of the Irish Company participating in some form. I agreed with them on the question of consultation and co-operation with Canada, and told them that we were keeping Canada fully informed as to our plans. Any such arrangement as they had suggested might quite possibly mean bringing the operation of Canadian trans-Continental services within the scope of one combined operating company, and this possibility had not yet been considered.They showed some dislike of the word &quot; Imperial &quot; in connection with a company operating across Irish Free State territory, and suggested, though not seriously, that the word &quot; Commonwealth &quot; would be preferable.8. I outlined then very briefly the position in regard to the carriage of mails, and pointed out to them that just as they took the view that at the present stage competition in services between Dublin and Great Britain was not desirable, so we took the view that on a trans-Atlantic service, which must of necessity be enormously expensive, we thought it undesirable that such traffic as there may be should be dissipated over a number of competing companies. As they were already aware, Imperial Airways and Pan-American Airways, as the chosen instruments of their respective Governments, had for years past been investi-gating together various problems connected with trans-Atlantic services, and we hoped to obtain the fullest co-operation as between the United Kingdom Govern-ment and the U.S.A. Government from one standpoint, and between Imperial Airways and Pan-American Airways from the other, or commercial, standpoint.9. The Irish Free State representatives said that they thought that if we should reach agreement for complete co-operation in the matter of establishing a base on the west coast and for a service in which their National company could have an interest, the Irish Free State Government would be very ready to agree to undertake not to alloto any other country (except the U.S.A. via Pan-American Airways) to operate trans-Atlantic services through the selected airport or through the Irish Free State.
10. I next dealt with the question of survey with a view to determining the most suitable site for a trans-Atlantic base on the west coast of Ireland, again making it clear that we had up to date carried out no survey even in Northern Ireland. They asked how I should propose to carry out such a survey, and I said that preferably I should do it by flying boat, but that I saw some difficulty in this, as, at the present time, no suitable civil flying boat was available. I said that I thought that possibly at any rate a preliminary survey could be carried out with a civil land machine operating from a small aerodrome which existed near Gal way, but that eventually a flying boat would be needed.The Irish Free State representatives said that they would find it difficult to agree to any survey being carried out by an R.A.F. aircraft and R.A.F. personnel, as this would give rise to many awkward questions. They thought, however, that there would be no difficulty in agreeing at once to a survey by civil aircraft and civil personnel, though they would prefer that this should be deferred, if possible, until some public announcement could be made as to an agreement in principle between the two Governments for co-operation in these matters. If such an announcement could be made at an early date, thereafter all would be smooth sailing and our arrangements for development could proceed quite openly.11. On the 30th July we met again in Mr. Lemass&apos;s office. Mr. Leydon gave him an account, which I supplemented, of our conversations of the previous day, and we had some further discussion. He had. no other points to raise, but I took the opportunity of stressing the importance of the matters referred to in paragraphs 8 and 9 above.Mr. Lemass said that if we could come to a satisfactory agreement for co-operation, he thought that his Government would be prepared to restrict the use of the base, as indicated in paragraph 9. He visualised that Galway, if selected, might become an important distributing centre for mails and passengers carried across the Atlantic by Pan-American Airways and Imperial Airways. Such services would, of course, have to be established under the terms of the International Air Convention.12. I may mention that the whole of our discussions were carried out on the most friendly basis. The Irish Free State representatives treated me in the most cordial manner, entertained me to lunch, and after our meeting with Mr. Lemass took me for a motor run into the mountains and subsequently delivered me to the steamer for my return journey to England.August 1, 1935.
