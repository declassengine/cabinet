C.Q.S.   392.COMMITTEE  OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.CHIEFS OF STAFF SUB-COMMITTEE.ITAL0-ABYSGINIAN DISPUTE. MEMORANDUM.At a meeting held on the 6th August5  1935c,  at which the Prime Minister was  in the Chair9   the following conclusion was re cordedo o o o&quot;(f) That the Secretary to  the Cabinet and Committee of Imperial Defence should inform the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee that the prime Minister would he glad if they would consider the following que stions;-(i)   At once to examine the question of what the position would he if Italy took the hit between her teeth.(ii)    On the assumption that the contin-gency referred to in (i) might take place9 are  there any steps that ought to be  taken at once to provide against it.&quot;In this latter connection the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the Foreign Office would have -no objection to any relatively quiet  steps being taken5 such as, for example, the raising of the anti-aircraft defences of Malta to the approved scale.      They would not even object  if the movement of anti-aircraft guns became public.2.      We have already prepared an Interim Memorandum (Paper No. 0.0.8.   388)  dealing with the military implications of the application of Article 16 of the Covenant of the this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.
League of Nations., which has he en forwarded to certain Ministers who have heen present in London,      In paragraph 3 we stated that we had directed a Sub-Committee to prepare a detailed Report dealing with the situation from the Naval? Military and Air points of view,3, The Report of that Qub-Committee - the Joint PlanningSub-Committee - has now heen drawn up and we considered it at a meeting held on 8th August;,  1935,      Their Reports as amended and approved hy us9  is attached as an Annex to this Memorandum.      We have  the  following observations to which we wish to draw the immediate attention of Ministers.4. Part V of the Report deals with Precautionary measureswhich should he  taken before initiating any action which may involve a state of war;    paragraph 71 et seq deals with interim measures9  for the most part unobtrusive^  which should he taken on the assumption that Italy may take the hit between her teeth.      The following is the position at the moment regarding the measures recommended,.Naval Measures,5, The Admiralty are taking the following steps toimprove the state of readiness Of the Navy, These measures are comparatively unobtrusive and it is hoped that they will not cause undue comment.(a)    The second half of the summer cruise programme of the Mediterranean Fleet is being re-tast and instead of cruising in Aegean and Adriatic Waters (including visits to Italy) the Fleet will proceed to Egypt and adjacent harbours about  the  end of August o(h)    Such minor steps as are possible withoutpublicity are being taken to expedite the bringing forward of the Reserve Fleet,
(c) The provision of anti-submarine apparatus for fitting to small craft is being accelerated.(d) The net defences and Ac A. defences which would he required to protect the harbour which will have to he used in Greek territory are being despatched to Malta,(e) The question of the suspension of British trade in the Mediterranean and its possible diversion round the Cape in the event of war with Italy is being discussed with the Board of Trade,6, In addition to the measures mentioned above9  thoseenumerated below are of great importance9 but since they would he almost certain to lead to  considerable comment, the Admiralty consider that Cahinet authority is necessary before taking them,(a)      The present programme of the Home Fleet is toleave its Home ports on 9th September and cruise in British waters - this programme is common knowledge. Unless after the discussion with France next week there is no chance of action being required against Italyo  the Admiralty propose that the Home Fleet shall leave their Home Ports as soon as the leave period is over (August 29th)?  and concentrate at Portland ready to sail for Gibraltar and certain units to join the Commander-in-Chiefj Mediterranean,In order that this may be done it would be necessary to inform the Fleet by 23rd August and certain earlier steps in connection with particular
;       244vessels would have  to be taken as soon as./possible - these earlier steps would not necessarily cause much comment.(b) It has been shown that in the event cf seriousaction against Italy it would be necessary to complete the Home and Mediterranean Fleets to full complement and. to bring forward the Reserve Fleet.This involves mobilisation which process takes about 7 days and. would inevitably cause much comment.The Admiralty however attach great importance to an early  decision to mobilise should the situation become menacing,  as until this is clone all Naval measures must be incomplete. Army Measures07. In paragraph 73 of the Report there is a recommendation for the despatch of anti-aircraft guns, searchlights, personnel and ammunition to Malta and Aden.      The number of guns and searchlights involved is stated in paragraphs 67 and 68. Whilst certain preliminary steps in this country and the despatch of the material could no doubt be effected secretly, the move of the essential personnel, especially at this season of the year, would certainly become known.8. A perioa of about three weeks would probably elapsebetween the issue of the orders and the arrival of the personnel and material at Malta.      If therefore it is considered that the situation is such as to make this action advisable then a very early decision is required in order that the moves can be  completed early  in September.9. It will be noted that it is not proposed to despatch any anti-aircraft guns or lights to Egypt.      Thisis partly due to the fact that we do not possess at the presenttime enough anti-aircraft units to be able to create an
adequate defence over so considerable an area.      Moreover, the distance from Italian territory in Libya is considerable, so that attacks on Egypt and the Suez Canal are not likely to be more than sporadic and our own aircraft, when reinforced should be capable of dealing with the situation.10.        &apos;i&apos;he War Office proposals for reinforcing Malta by an additional two Battalions are  contained in paragraph 67. This is a step which, of course, would immediately receive the fullest pub].i city as it would involve calling up Section A of the Reserve.      It is estimated that it would take three weeks for the move to be completed. Air Force Measures.11.        The interim measures for the Royal Air Force are dealt with in paragraph 74.      The second, of the measures,  the collec tion and despatch of supplies to selected bases,  could, be carried out unobtrusively.    But to make ready, In all respects the reinforcing air contingents would inevitably lead to publicity.      Certain measures could be taken quietly,  but not all5 for example, many of the personnel are on leave at the present time and would have to he recalled.12.        These air contingents are destined in the first instance for Malta and Egypt and though the two emergency squadrons could be ready for despatch in one week,  it would take two months before the remainder of the con-contingents from this country were ready to leave;    to these periods,  the duration of the voyage must be added. General Observations.13,       We think it necessary to call attention to the general strategical situation which may arise as the consequence of war against Italy.,      If the Fleet is involved in active operations,  in spite of the co-operation of the French and other Navies it must be expected that losses will ensue,&quot; and the resultant situation will be that the British Fleet, already weak, will be still further reduced.
There is bound to be a danger,  therefore, that the results of a war with Italy would be to leave the British Fleet temporarily weakened to such an extent as to be unable to fulfil its world-wide responsibilities.Similarly, the despatch of an air contingent from this country and the possible losses it may suffer will materially affect the air defence of Great Britain and disjoint the arrangements at present in hand for attain-ing air parity with Germany by April 1937;    moreover the existing arrangements for the reinforcement of Singapore could not be counted upon in case of an emergency of the kind now under consideration.14.        We desire most clearly to emphasise the statement in paragraph 75 (b)&quot;At least two months&apos; notice is required before all our forces can be considered as able effectively to co-operate ..... on a war basis&quot;.It  is of the utmost importance that in our future negotiations with Prance and Italy, and at the forth-coming League meeting, no action should be taken likely to precipitate hostilities, and that the application of the Covenant of the League,  or indeed any action likely to cause Italy to taxe the bit between her teeth,  should be delayed until the Services have had sufficient warning in which to make their preparations.Any idea that sanctions can be enforced whenever diplomatically desirable is highly dangerous from the point of view of the Services, and we urge that no
measures almost certain to lead to war,  such as the closing of the Suez Canal,  should be taken until the Services are prepared.15.        In view of the length of time which will in-inevitably elapse before all the Services are ready,  and having in view the publicity which will inevitably accompany some of the steps to be taken? we ask for decisions at the earliest possible date as to when the recommended measures are to be taken.16.        Finally, we desire to stress that the moral and political co-operation of France is not  sufficient. Her assured military support,  concerted with ourselves before the League Council meeting of the 4th September, is essential.      Without that,  there is great risk of all active measures, together with the onus which they will carry with them, falling on ourselves alone with serious consequences.(Signed)    EFItfLE CHATFIEIjj,C.L.

ANNEX.CCS.  590 (J.P.)TaIso Paper No, J.P.  115).COMMUTES OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.CHIEFS OF ST.-.FF SUB-COMMITTEE.MILIJABY 1M?LICA!1I0NS OF THE - APPLICATION ; OF ARTICLE .16&apos;6W&apos;YM&quot;&apos;cWmMT&quot;GF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS.REPORT 3Y THE JOINT PLANNING SUB--COMMITTEE.P art. 1^____INTRODUCTION.The Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee at their 147th Meeting directed that the Joint Planning Sub-G ommittee  should prepare a detailed Report on the military implications of the application of Article 16 of the Covenant and,   to assist us, drew attention to the existence of their Interim Memorandum on this subject circulated as Paper No,  C,0,,S.-388.2. It will be convenient to examine the action that might be taken  uric.or the two following heads,  since different considera-tions arise under each:-;&quot; ;    i :(a) The exercise of general economic pressure on italy (Part II) -.1        N ;  ;:.(b) The interruption of the sea communications of the Italian Expeditionary Force in East Africa (Part III).3. We have also considered the possible reactions of italy to the application of general Economic Pressure and the pre-cautionary measures necessary on our part to guard against these reactions,  to which the Chiefs of Staff referred in general terms in CO. S-.-388.
First Stage.4. Article 16 has never yet been applied,  and it isunderstood that some doubt exists as to the actual inter-pretation that might be adopted in its practical application,. Assuming, however,  that the situation is reached when it is decided that Article 16 has become applicable,  the obligation on the Members of the League is to take the economic and financial measures mentioned in paragraph 1 of Article 16o5. These measures do not involve the use of belligerentrights but could (subject to any questions as to the rights of Non-Members of the League) be applied by steps,  taken within our own jurisdiction,  which may be described as being in the nature of a prohibition of &quot;trading with the enemy&quot;.6o The States which are not Members of the League wouldbe under no obligation to co-operate.      The most important of these are the United  States, Japan, Brazil and Germany (who must be so treated from the practical point of view).Military Implications of Situation in First Stage. 7. Beyond the steps referred to in paragraph 5,  action could also,  in theory, be taken at sea against Italian shipping without declarations of war on Italy.      It must be emphasised, however,   that in practice any attempt to enforce such a policy would inevitably lead to active hostilities.      Italy could, and undoubtedly would,  provide naval escorts for her shipping and the naval forces of the participating Powers would either have to let them pass unmolested or to attack the escorting man-of-war.8. Even if the measures taken were restricted tothose mentioned in paragraph 5,  they would be bitterly resented by Italy.      In the inflamed state of Italian opinion some incident might easily occur or Italy might even retaliate by attacking some vulnerable and
important objective in a participating&quot; State. *9 0        Non-Member States.      With regard, to the position vis-a-vis the no -Meiaber States.,  in spite of the wording of paragraph 1 of Article 16,  it is under-stood to be generally accepted interna.tiona.lly that there is at this stage no obligation to take forcible measures to prevent intercourse between them arid the Covenant-breaking State.      It follows that if the Non-Member States did not voluntarily take steps to prohibit commercial intercourse between their own nationals  and Italy,  such intercourse  could only be prevented by the Naval Powers (Member States)  declaring themselves to be in a. state of war with Italy and thus  acquiring belligerent rights.10.        Assuming, however,  that such action was not taken,  the situation would be that trade would continue between Italy and those States (whether Members  of the League or not)  which declined to co-operate or acquiesce in the application of economic pressure.      The question, arises,  therefore, whether such pressure as it would be possible to apply in these conditions would be likely to be effective.-f*        The  answer involves consideration of a number of uncertain factors  and from such study of the problem as it has been possible for us to make,   it appears to be very doubtful whether effective pressure on Italy could be brought to bear within a reasonable time without the stoppage of Italy&apos;s    seaborne trade,&quot; We have not in this Report considered the position of our nationals and those of other participatory States who are resident in Italy.
and this, as has been pointed out, cannot be ensured without the acquisition of belligerent rights.Second. Stage.12,       The second stage of economic pressure would be reached when and if it were decided, for the reasons outlined above,  to treat Italy as actually at war with Great Britain and other Members of the League,  so that by declaring war upon her and thus acquiring    belligerent rights action could be taken to control her trace in contraband with non-co-ope rating countries.13o       Under paragraph 2 of Article 16 it is the &quot;duty of the Council&apos;&apos; to recommend to the Governments concerned what forces they should &quot;contribute to the armed forces to be used to orotect the Covenants of the League&apos;&apos;.140        Although the Council may recommend certain aotion it is for each Government to decide what it will do.      It is of great importance to this country that the  active co-operaci m of the principal Member States should be assured.      This point is further developed in Part III,, and also in Part IV9 where the situation in the event of war is dealt with.The possible reactions of the non-co-operating countries to the stoppage of their trace with Italy are, in the first place, political questions to which no doubt His Majesty&apos;s Government would give the fullest consideration if the occasion arose.      It is understood that in the case of measures at sea being applied which went beyond the American
3 h Hconception of belligerent rights there would be some danger of the United States becoming definitely obstructive.      Should this be the case, we should be at once faced with the problem of maintaining our historic attitude in this matter.16. Another serious consideration which cannot be lost sight of is the possibility that Japan might take the opportunity of our being embroiled in Europe to take action in the Par East contrary to our own and League interests.      The gravity of the threat to our security in these circumstances has been s-d frequently stated by the Chiefs of Staff and is so well known to His Majesty&apos;s Government that it need not be reiterated here.Conclusions as regards the exercise of Economic Pressure.IV, (a)   The measures contemplated in the first stage of the application of economic pressure to Italy need not involve the use of belligerent rights but there is a distinct risx that even these measures might lead to war.        Italy would bitterly resent the application of such pressure and might retaliate by an act of war against a participating State. Apart from this,  there is the danger that the measures contemplated would not prove effective and, being committed,  the League would then try to set in m^tlsh the more serious steps which would necessitate a declaration of war against Italy by the Naval Powers that were co-operating.(b)    It would be necessary,  therefore,  from the military point of view,  to take full military pre-cautions in the event of it being decided to participate in the exercise of economic pressure.
(c) It is presumed that His Majesty1s Government would not contemplate the exercise of such pressure without the active co-operation of France and at least the passive support of other Mediterranean Powers,The importance of this is further developed later in this Report,(d) The  attitude of  the United States of America would be of the greatest importance and might raise in an acute form the vexed question of the &quot;Freedom of the Seas&quot;.PART III.       INTERRUPTION OF SEA COMMUNICATIONS OF IT ALT AN FORCES  IN EAST AFRICA,18.      The means by which the see communications ofthe Italian Expeditionary Force in East Africa could beinterrupted are % -(a) By controlling the passage of the Sues Canal;(b) By establishing a contraband control organisation.Control of passage of Suez Canal.19.      Under Article 1 of the Suez Canal Convention, Italy has the  right of free passage for her warships and her merchant ships in time of war.      The SignatoryPowers agreed &quot;not in any way to interfere with thefree use of the Canal in time of war as in time ofpeace&quot;,   and the Canal is never to be blockaded.20.      Nevertheless,  the view has been expressed that action might legitimately be taken to deny the use of the Canal to Italian shipping at the request of the Council of the League acting under Article 16.21.      If this  is  accepted,  it is regarded as of the utmost
importance that the collective nature of the action should, be emphasised by the . association of other Powers with us in this action as it is essential that Japan&apos;s apprehensions should not he aroused by single-handed action on our part.22,        Prom the practical point of view,  the willing co-operation of the officials of the Suez Canal Company, wlvH are predominantly of French nationality,  is required.      In the circumstances contemplated this will presumably be forthcoming but the corollary is that action could not be taken without the sympathetic co-operation of Prance.2t*&quot;        The next and most important point is that should an Italian man-of-war,  or a merchant ship escorted by a man-of-war,   attempt the passage of the Canal,  it could only be prevented, by the use of force.      In other words, unless Italy capitulated under the threat,   the closing of the Canal involves war with Italy.      It would he necessary,  therefr-re, for full military precautions to be taken before any such action were taken.24. The situation has so far been considered inrelation only to Italian shipping, but it is necessary also to consider the position in regard to the ships of oth&apos;--r nationalities since these might be employed in the transport of supplies for the Italian forces. No serious difficulties seem likely to arise in respect of the Members of the League,  whether they were active-ly co-operating in the exercise of pressure or not.The position vis-a-vis the Non-Member States is, however,  different.      The most important are the United States of America, Japan and Germany,  and though the first two are not parties to the Suez Canal
%j ifConvention,  it is understood that no legal justifica-tion could be found tor denying the use of the Canaltc their ships engaged on the traffic in question.It appears,   therefore,that such traffic on the partof the Non-Members of the League could only be effective-ly stopped by  the adoption of the measures describedunder the next heeding.      (Paragraphs 28-29.)25.      A draft plan has been prepared for ensuring the safety of the Canal in certain circumstances  and the local authorities ere in possession of the requisite instructions.      Although it would not be necessary to implement the whole of this plan at the outset,    the measures required to meet the  contingency above could be applied without delay,26.      The  attitude of the Egyptian Government cannot be left out of  consideration though we have every reason to suppose that it would be sympathetic, and our High Commissioner in Caire has reported that Mchammedan opinion in that part  of the world is turning against  Italyc27.      Action in the Canal area- alone would not stop supplies reaching East Africa from the eastward.      It is improbable, however,  that the Italian forces could be maintained by supplies from Eastern sources or via the Cape,  unless Italy has  anticipated the  need and made the necessary arrangements in advance.      This it would be /difficult for her  to do.Estaolishment of Contraband Control Organisation. 28.      This necessitates the exercise of belligerent rights and could, therefore,only be undertaken after a declaration of war on Italy.      The necessary steps could be taken in the Aden area,   in the Gulf of Suez,  clear
of the Canal Zone,  and if necessary at Gibraltar, &apos;    In this connection, however,  the action of Italian air forces acting from Eritrea may render difficult our naval action in the Red Sea;     this question is referred to in paragraph   52 below.29.      Action in the Canal area would not be necessary thus avoiding possible complications vis-a-vis the non-Member States.Conclusions  as to the interruption of sea, communications of Italian ?&apos;orces in Africa.30.       (a)    If the Council of the League decided to deny the use of the Suez Canal to Italian shipping,  it would be of the utmost importance that other Powers should be associated with us in the necessary action,  and the active co-operation of Prance is regarded as&apos; essential.(b) Such action involves the probability ofwar with Italy and full military precautions by the co-operating Powers would, therefore &quot;have to be concerted in advance and the requisite action taken.(c) The  attitude of the United States of America, Japan and Germany would be an important- factor in de-termining the  effectiveness of the pressure since their ships could not be denied the use of the Suez Canal.      If these    Powers aid not supply Italian East African ports, the  stoppage of other sea transport through the Canal would make it extremely difficult for Italy to maintain her forces in East Africa.(d) If a state of war is reached it will be prefer-aele to interrupt the sea. communications of the Italian
9 K ^wo!forces by the eB.tabllshm.ent of a contraband control organisation thus avoiding the special difficulties in- -volved in the use of the Canal zone.(e)    If contraband control is established,  this would probably result after a short time not only in Italy having to abandon her military operations in East Africa but would also necessitate the evacuation of the troops already there.PART IV.    PRINCIPAL STRATEGICAL CONSIDERATIONS. The Object.31.        Assuming that the Powers have become engaged in war;,   the object will be the limited one  of forcing Italy to desist from aggressive action against Abyssinia.  Although it would not presumably be the desire&apos; of the League 5 nor the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government, to employ more force than y?as necessary to achieve the limited object  set out above it is necessary to recall that, as already suggested,, if matters reach this stage the scope of the operations will not necessarily be within the control of the League but may be determined by possible action on the part  of Italy.      The  strategical situation must,  therefore, be considered on this basis.Contraband Control.38;.        The establishment of e contraband control organisa-tion in the Red Sea would necessitate the provision of the necessary craft for patrol and interception in the Gulf of Suez,  and at Aden.      A covering force  sufficient to deal with an attach by the Italian naval forces would
bs required.      Air reconnaissance would be desirable in each area to facilitate the work of t.o.e patrols and of the covering force.33.        Should the navel operations include the exercise of economic pressure on Italy the establishment of further Contraband Control Bases at Gibraltar (if not already established) and in the Aegean would be necessary. The former calls for no special comment but the latter raises questions of some importance in the present connec-tion.54.        Owing to the many exits from the Aegean efiectivecontrol could not be estao.Lis.aod without  the use of bases in Greek and Turkish waters for the patrollingforces.      Suda Bay in Crete and i/ityleni would be suitable.That is to say, at least the passive ca-operation of greece and Turkey is required,  and it is assumed that tneterritorial waters and. harbours of these States would be aArailable for use. General Naval Disposit ions.35.        The task of containing the main Italian fleet in the central Mediterranean area will fail to the combined International fleets.      The most  satisfactorydispositions would probably be that  the French should work mainly in the Western Basin and the British Fleetmainly in the central area.36.        Covering forces based on Fort Said and Alexandria would be required to prevent any attempt by Italy to reinforce her forces (at present  small) in the iced Sea and at Gibraltar to cover the Western exit of the M e d i t e r r a n e a n.
37. A- summary is given in Appendix I of the british naval Forces that would be available in the Mediterranean and Home Fleets early in September, together with the French forces maintained in commission in Home Waters in comparison with the total strength of the Italian forces at home and in the Red Sea.      Although the combined British and French Fleets are markedly superior&apos; in all types of vessels, the naval dispositions already discussed shew that it will not be possiole to maintain them as a single force,      Italy will be operating on interior lines and may concentrate against the British Fleet in the centra area or the French Fleet  in the western area.      It will be seen from the table in .Appendix I that Italy will possess a  superiority in destroyer forces over ourselves and has also a very large submarine force.Army,38, It is considered that 9  in spite of the recent increase  in her land forces,  the Italian Array will becounter-balanced by the Armies of  Yugoslavia   and France.-No Italian troops could be moved from Italian soil in view of threat  to her frontiers.Air.39. A comparison of British,, French and Italian AirForces available,or which can be made available sis given in Appendix II.      We are now drawing on our reserves to meet the requirements of expansion and our ability to despatcn and maintain a force overseas has therefore been reduced to a minimum.      The two emergency squadrons are the  only squadrons that  could be despatched on a mobile basis to operate independently of existing Royal Air Force technical maintenance  organisations in the Mediterranean and Middle Bast.      Assuming that mobilisation is not
declared the preparation of squadrons additional to the two emergency squadrons would seriously affect, our expansion arrangements in regard to the provision of personnel.POSSIBLE ITALIAN REACTIONS.40. Italy&apos;s possible aggressive reactions maytaice some or all of the following forms,  and of the objectives to which she might choose to direct her attentions Malta seems to take first place. Malt a.41. With the British and Pre rich Fleets activelydo-operating in the Mediterranean it is unlikely that Italy would attempt  a military landing on the Island of Malta or that she would undertake naval bombardment operations of a greater scale than in the form of sporadic raids, but it is well within Italy&apos;s power to concentrate a heavy scale of air attack on Malta,,42. In consequence of the Governments decision notto incur expenditure on measures of defence required to provide   exclusively  against attack by the United States of America, France or Italy,- the modernisation of the local defences of Malta has not progressed to any appreciable extent,  &amp;nd these defences are far.from adequate to deal with present-day forms of attack by Italy.      The Island&apos;s defences may be able to counter sporadic naval raids, but Malta&apos;s air defence can only be achieved by counter offensive measures in the form of air attack against  suitable objectives in Italy calculated to prevent her concentrating her air forces against Malta. As matters stand,  such increases in local air and A.A. defence as could be achieved at  short notice Vi/ithout,
in addition, effective support from other air bases would be wholly inadequate to defend an island area, such as Malta5 a ainat the metropolitan air forces of a great Power o43.    The first essentials therefore, would be adequate bases in European and North Africa,! territory from which our air forces, and. the air forces of our Allies, could operate against objectives in Italian territory.      So far as we are concerned, this postulates the necessity of operating from French territory in imirope and North Africa.44.    Some augmentation of the military garrison in Malta would be necessary, principally for internal security, ammunition reserves for the coast defences would nave to be increased, and any additions possible made to the local air and. A.A.   defences.45.    Finally, it would, seem that -unless counter air action by us could be undertaken simultaneously with, if not oefore,Italy&apos;s air concent-rat ion against Malta, the mediterranean fleet would have to consider an alternative base to Malta from which to carry out its operations in the Mediterranean. Attach on Merchant Shipping.46.    The maintenance of our shipping through the Mediterranean would present very serious difficulties in the face of attack by Italian forces  especially should Ital$ decide to use her submarines and aircraft in an unrestricted manner.      The pro-vision of adequate anti-submarine vessels and aircraft would take considera,ble time.In the event of the situation reaching actual hostilities we consider that until the necessary counter measures could be improvised and the situation is clearer, British trade in the Mediterranean should be suspended, and it might be necessary    subsequently    to    divert    it    round    the    Cape and   accept    the   resultant    dislocation    of    shipping.
4-7. The  Italian troops in Libya have been heavilydrawn upon Tor Eritrea and could not be reinforced from Italy whilst we exercise naval control of the mediterranean-nean;    consequently9 no land threat is to be expected on Egypt from the West.      In the air3 however, the po-sition is different.      Aircraft can easily be flown from Italy to Libya,, and with difficulty from Eritrea to Libya.      Consequently,,  it will be possible for Italy to carry out sporadic attacks from Libya on the Suez Canal with such force as she may possess in Libya at  any one time and provided that the.air units there located have the necessary maintenance f acilit ie s.48. The  object  of air attack on Egypt might beto cause alarm in the minds of the inhabitants and so increase the internal security problem especially in view of the large Italian community;      or against definitely military objectives such as barracks and depots;      or it might be done  simply to cause us general embarrassment at a time when our difficul-ties would already be great.49. The  closing of the Suez Canal to Italianshipping might lead to retaliatory air action on the part  of Italy who might attempt attacks on British shipping in the Canal with the intention of denying it  to our own use.
50.      Whatever the objects of Italian air action from Libya may be it is clear that the air defence of Egypt, and particularly the G^nal Zone,  would he a commitment for which our existing resources in the Middle East are entirely inadequate.      Our air forces would have to be increased and. adequate reserves provided and this would take from 1 to 3 months depending on the reinforcements sent. It is considered, however,. that the British troops in Egypt are in general sufficient for its probable tasks.East of Suez.51.      In East Africa, Italy could overrun British Somaliland without great difficulty, provided she were not closely engaged with the Abyssinians.      In Sudan and lvenya we have but few troops to meet Italian aggression hut the difficulties of communications are great and the Italians could not hope to get any important results before contraband control proved effective in reducing her forces to immobility. A battalion from West Africa has been warned to be in readiness to support our forces in Somaliland,  and a battalion from Tanganyika is prepared to reinforce Kenya. The question of air reinforcements is under active discussion.52.      Action by Italian air forces would not be affected in the  initial stages by the severance of Italian sea communications.      The extent to which Italian air forces could be diverted from action against Abyssinia would, however,  depend largely on the degree  to which her land forces are committed. If these are heavily engaged,and especially if they are conducting a retreat,  it is to be anticipated that the Italian air forces would not lightly be diverted to tasks against ourselves.
53. Assuming, however, that Italy would, he ahle to divert her air forces from their tasks in Abyssinia,  the -most effective action she could take would he attacks against British ships in the Straits of Bahel Mandeb and against Aden.      Attacks against shipping would, however,  only be serious if Italy decided to adopt unrestricted measures and,  in any case, if trade had been diverted from the Mediterranean route the amount of shipping passing would be small.54. Other objectives are within range of Italianair forces, namely, Mombassa, Nairobi, Khartoum, Port Sudan and railway communications generally.      Although attacks on these would have little military significance, the possibility of their occurrence cannot be ruled out,  since they would tend to disturb the internal security in our possessions and possess a general &quot;diversiona^ value&quot;.55. In the circumstances visualised in which italy might divert aircraft for attack on ourselves,   there is   -no doubt that we are very exposed to possible air attack. Passive defence in so large an area would be impossible, and if ad.eq.uate provision is to be made to meet the eventuality,  it will he necessary to establish our own air forces within range of the relevant Italian, bases.
PART    V.-   PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES NECESSARY,56. In their interim memorandum (C.O.S.   388)  theChiefs of Staff in paragraph 4 (3)  stated that the possibility of war resulting from any attempt to exer-cise economic pressure or interrupt Italy&apos;s communications with Abyssinia necessitates preparations in anticipation, and in this part of the Report the measures which should be taken before initiating any action which may involve a state of war are dealt &quot;with.NAVAL.Reserve Fleet.57. The whole of the Reserve fleet would be required assoon as possible in the circumstances visualised.The present situation of the Reserve Fleet is &apos;.-Crui ser s.4-7.5 Cruisers, 4 - 6&quot; Cruisers at 14 days&apos;  notice. 4-6&quot; % - at 4 months&apos;  notice.Aircraft Carriers.1 - at 14 days&apos;  notice.De stroyer s.316 in commission with - complement.7 - at  14 days&apos;  notice. 18 -    &quot;42      &quot; &quot;9 -    &quot;56      &quot; &quot;Minesweepers.9 Home  - at 14 days&apos;  notice. 9 Malta    &quot;    14 &apos;   &quot; &quot;A reserve  ship on being brought forward requires some three weeks to work up efficiency before she can be/
m fx f*considered fit for service.      It will consequently be clear that if ships remain at present notice some five weeks must elapse after the order to mobilise before any of the reserve fleet  (with the possible exception of the 16 destroyers in commission with -g complement) can be available and it would be from 2 to 3 months before the bulk of our reserve destroyers, of which type  of vessel we should be in particular need,  could be brought forward.58. It is considered that if there is any prospect of active measures being taken against  Italy,  action should be   taken    to    reduce    the   notice at which all ships at more than  14 days are kept to that figure.      Such action would involve certain expense and no doubt could not be kept  secret.Personnel.59. The majority of the Home and Mediterranean FleetShips are not fully manned.      They could not carry out war duties at full efficiency and it would be necessary for them to be brought up to war complement.      In order to complete these fleets and to man the Reserve Fleet it would be necessary to &quot;mobilise&quot;, which process takes about 7 days.A/S Measures.60. A/S measures may be divided into those requiredfor the protection of the fleet and its bases against S/M attack and those required for the protection of tr-ade should Italy adopt unrestricted warfare against  shipping which contingency we feel cannot in the circumstances visualised be ruled out61. The Fleet depends primarily for its A/S protectionon destroyers and the small total (50) of our destroyers which are fitted with A/S apparatus (zi which 9 are in the Far East and 4 in reserve) leaves no margin whatever.:
At the present moment only some 30 - 4-0 sets of Asdic apparatus are available for fitting to the small craft which would have to he taken up in emergency.  It is considered that all possible steps should be taken to accelerate the building up of this reserve of A/S apparatus as quickly as possible.Movements,62. This report does not deal in detail with possiblepreliminary movements of the Fleet but examination of thesubject has led to the conclusion that in any such movements the following should be considered;: -1.    The necessity for reinforcing the Mediterreanean Fleet,2.    The possibility that Italy might despatch forces to the Suez Canal in order to forestall the closing of the Cana.1 against her by direction of the Council of the League,,3*    The possibility that Italy might take very early air action against Malta and the fleet there if it appeared probable that pressure was to be applied to horc4. The possibility that Italy might reinforce her forces in the Fed Sea by surface or submarine forces.Co-operation of Greece and Turkey,63, As has &quot;been previously mentioned the use of aGreek port or ports and possibly a Turkish port would be necessary to  the operations of the Fleet,,    Attention is drawn to this point again so that the question of regulariz-ing such use may be fully considered,,Diversion of Shipping*64c As has been mentioned it may be necessary in certaincircumstances to divert British shipping from the Mediter-ranean to the Cape Route.    It is suggested that this matter should be discussed in detail between the Admiralty and the Board of Trade with a view to rapid action should the occasion arise.
Contraband Control.65. The organisation of Contraband Control Bases willtake some time, especially that at Aden,    While it is not suggested that any action, other than the adjustment of existing plans, should he taken now, it is considered that the organisation of these bases should commence before it is decided to exercise economic pressure, so that in the very likely event of a state of weir following they may be ready with out delay.Mobile Naval Base Defence Organisation,66,s It is estimated that extemporised arrangements couldbe made for net defences to be sent out and laid at a. selected anchorage in Greek waters in 42 days which might be reduced to 15 if the material were moved to Malta before. Details of the organisation are contained in Appendix III. 6 a ok.  guns and 12 searchlights, with their personnel, will he requiied from Army sources to complete the A.A.  defence of the mobile base organisation.
ARMY.26967. The garrison of Malta should he 4 BattalionssFor several years the strength has heen 2 Battalions owing to the necessity of providing troops for Palestine, and it is considered that the garrison should he increased to its proper strength by the despatch of 2 Battalions from Great Britain.      The strength of A.A. Defence has not heen considered in relation to attack by Italy.      This would involve reconsideration of the whole problem and in the meantime it is suggested that the defence should be brought up to the approved interim scale (O.I.D. Paper NO.402-G) by the despatch of 16 A.A.  guns, 12 A.A.  search-lights together with the necessary personnel from the Field Force or other resources in Great Britain.      In addition it will be necessary to augment the ammunition for AoAo and coast defence guns9and it will be necessary to increase the personnel for coast defence guns to Higher Colonial Establishment.Aden.68. At present 4 A.A.  guns are in position but only  of them are manned.      It will be necessary    to send out personnel from Great Britain to man the additional A.A.  guns and personnel will also be required for the coast defence armament and electric lights.      A.A.  and coast  defence ammunition is also necessary.Sudan and East Africa.69. Sufficient troops are available in the Sudan tomeet any likely threat from Italy.      A Battalion from West Africa and a Battalion from Tanganyika should be despatched to reinforce the troops in Somaliland and Kenya respectively.
AIR..70. It will be necessary to increase the Air forces and to build up a reserve of supplies in Malta, Aden, Egypt  (especially in the Canal Zone) the Sudan, East Africa and Somaliland.      The forces available are shown in Appendix II.      Their disposition must remain a matter for later decision depending upon the development of the situation and the effect upon Italian forces of the interruption of their sea communications.      When the air reinforcements are available in the Middle Fast (and Malta)  and adequate supplies have been laid down in probable theatres of operations, the mobility of the Squadrons will permit of rapid concentration at the required point as the circumstances of the moment dictate. At least two months notice is    required to enable the reinforcing contingent to be prepared and despatched and the necessary supplies laid down.      Plans must be concerted with the French for the operation of our Air Forces from   South East. France and French Forth Africa prior to any risk of Italian air attacks on Malta developing.INTERIM MEASURES.71. On the assumption that  Italy may take the bit be-tween her teeth, but that only unobtrusive measures willbe permitted by His Majesty&apos;s Government at the present stage,  it is suggested that the following action should be taken by the Services.NAVY.72. To increase,  as far as possible,  within ths abovelimitation,   the state of. readiness  of theFleet.To accelerate provision of anti-submarine apparatus.
To discuss with the Board of Trade regarding the possible diversion of Mediterranean shipping.To despatch net defences etc.,  of the Mobile Naval Base to Malta,ARMY,75.To despatch Anti-aircraft guns., searchlights, personnel and ammunition to Malta and Aden.To despatch to Malta additional Anti-aircraft gunss  searchlights and personnel to co-operate with the Mobile Naval Base organisation.AIR FORCE,74.To place the reinforcing air contingent from the United Kingdom referred to in Appendix II on a mobile basis.To collect and despatch supplies to selected bases referred to in paragraph 70.Depending on the method of despatch eventually decided upon it may be necessary to  commence despatch of aircraft of the United Kingdom contingent to Malta and the Middle Fast for re-erection locally and to despatch extra personnel to the Middle East to deal with reserve supply and aircraft re-erection problems.75.In conclusion, it is desired to draw attentionto the following matters of highest importance -(a) It is essential that we should have the active co-operation of the other League Powers and that concerted war plans should be drawn up in conjunction with, at least, the major Powers concerned.(b) At least two months&apos;  notice is required before all our forces can be considered as able effectively to co-operate in those plans on a war basis.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, 7th August,   1935.

APPLMDTX 117. jAvallabiIjPtjr.jah Sliprt.....Notice.The full M.N.B.D.O.  equipment  is on a five years&apos; development programme and will not he complete until 1939, at the present rate of progress.      Such elements as have been assembled are at  two months9 notice.      During this period the base snip is taken up and. equipped, stores are purchased, and. assembled, and the necessary reserve personnel t rained..On the above footing,  the organisation is not. one that can be inaugurated, in peace time, but should an extemporised organisation be required in preparation for hostilities which may break out in, say, two months&apos;  time, the following steps would have to be taken.2. Personnel.700 to 900 marines are required.      To produce these without calling up reserves it would be necessary to stop all drafting, to stop all leave,  including foreign service leave, to stop courses of instruction, and possibly to relieve the London Guards.3.  Pea Transport.It is proposed to use the IRON DUKE as a base ship and to transport the residue of the equipment in one of H.M.  Ships.PEGASUS could be used for a mine depot  ship, but this would entail cessation of catapult trials for new construction.The A/S boom is.at Rosyth, and would need a cargo steamer to transport it, together with the A/T baffles, and an extemporised C.K.B. boom equipment,  to the selected base.The A/3 boom, is the most important element of the defence, and the following Is an approximate time programme for
transporting and laying it at a base in the Eastern or CentralMe d i t e r ran e an;-Zero day        ...        Orders issued to despatch the boom.Z h- 8 days    ...        Merchant vessel taken up.Z h- 16    &quot;      ...        Vessel completes loading boommat eria1 at Rosyth. Z 4- 23    &quot;      ...       Vessel arrives Navarin. Z 4- 42    &quot;      ...       Boom laid.This period of 42 days would be reduced, to 16 days if thematerial.were transported in a cargo steamer to Malta in anticipation of trouble.4.   (a)  Beafront Defences.1 6&quot; battery equipped for indirect fire. 1 4&quot; close defence battery.. 3 Defence electric lights. 4 3&quot; A/A guns.-No more A/A guns or searchlights are available,  and the old ones held in reserve at Woolwich are probably useless.(b) Under-water Defences.7 miles of indicator loop,  two miles of A/S boom and controlled mines to provide a single line for an entrance two miles in width are available.GUARDIAN can lay two miles of A/T net and another 3 miles could, be held in reserve,(c) G.M.B.  defences could be improvised, and sent out in the ship carrying the boom material, but a proper A/C.M.B. boom would take at least 4 months to make and. lay.(d) Pier laiicling transport and workshop material, Sufficient material is available.(e) Local patrols, boom craft,  etc.The Portland A/S Flotilla and Minesweeping Flotilla and the Fishery Patrol trawlers could be sent out without touching reserves.CORONET, from Rosyth;,  could go out in fine weather. MOY and OUSE,  target towing craft at Malta,  could be converted into gate vessels in a fortnight.
?7fi5.  Special Ap^licatign^of M.N.3.D.O.  Organisation to Defence of Ifavarin. &apos; &quot;  &quot;IRON DUKE and a selected man-of-war could grotably embark material in a fortnight and reach Navarin in zero + 25 days, A/S boom and A/T baffles cculd be on the spot and laid in Z -f 42 days, which might be reduced to Z 4 16 days if gear were moved to Malta before the situation became critical.Navarin lends itself fairly well to defence against submarine attack by A/S boom&apos;, A/T baffles and an extemporised C.M.B. defence Indicator loops are of doubtful value and it is not recommended to lay a controlled minefield due to the depth&apos; of the water.A/A defence would have to be provided by the Fleet,Plans Division.7th August,  1935,
