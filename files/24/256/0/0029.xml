The Sub-Committee should be authorised, if necessary, to consult the Staffs of the Defence Departments and/or the Chiefs of Staff Committee direct; (6) That the Minister for League of Nations Affairs should be added to the Sub-Committee for the purposes of this Inquiry.&quot;2. We have examined the problem in as great a detail as the time at our disposal and the necessities of maintaining the utmost secrecy have permitted. With regard to the directions in the Terms of Reference that we should consider and report on the application of Article 16 of the Covenant, it is necessary to point out that hitherto Reports prepared by us on various aspects of the possibility of exerting pressure t have been confined to the problems arising previous to a state of war. If would be possible for the Council of the League under either Article 11 or 13 to recommend the exercise of economic pressure on Italy, before hostilities had actually broken out between Italy and Abyssinia, with a view to preventing the outbreak of war. The particular situation, however, which we are now asked by the Cabinet to examine seems likely to end in a clear state of war before any economic pressure which could be brought to bear in the period prior to a declaration of war by Italy became effective.* A small Sub-Committee of the Advisory Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on Trade Questions in Time of War.f Economic Pressure on.

Countries likely to Co-operate in the Exercise of Pressure on Italy.3. It is not proposed, therefore, in this Report to attempt to estimate the response that such a recommendation under Article 11 or 13 might be expected to have on Member and non-Member States. It will be more convenient to pass at once to the position which will arise when, owing to the outbreak of hostilities between Italy and Abyssinia, the Members of the League will be required to decide whether a violation of the Covenant which brings Article 16 into play has been committed.4. This decision will depend largely on how the question is presented. It may well be that the issue may be confused by a variety of causes. There may be doubt as to whether a &apos;&apos; resort to war &apos;&apos; has actually taken place; there may be a dispute as to who was the immediate aggressor; counter-accusations by Italy against Abyssinia may introduce a further complication, and there may even be disagreement as to the interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Covenant and over questions of procedure. If the issue was thus confused it would be quite impossible to foretell the attitude which different Governments would adopt towards a proposal that they should apply the economic pressure provided for in Article 16.5. For the purposes of. this Report, therefore, we have felt it necessary to assume that the issue would be clear, and that the resort to war by Italy in violation of Article 12, 13 or 15 was flagrant, gross and undisguised, and that, moreover, the Council had either by unanimous vote been able to give an &quot; opinion &quot; to this effect, or had only been formally prevented from doing so by the adverse vote of Italy. It is highly improbable that such an &quot; opinion &quot; could be given unless France and Great Britain took the lead in proposing it, whereas under their joint leadership it is possible that, in the. circumstances contemplated, an expression of opinion by all the Members other than Italy might be achieved.6. It is natural to suppose that those Governments which had voted for such an &apos; &quot;opinion &apos;&apos; would proceed to apply economic pressure, but the questions now arise : (1) Would any Council Member be likely to abstain from voting for the &quot;opinion,&quot; not because they disputed the facts but because, for political or economic reasons, they were resolved not to impose economic pressure on Italy ?(2) To what extent would League Members not on the Council endorse the Councils opinion by applying economic pressure 1  And(3) What would be the attitude of the big non-Member States ?7. These questions are examined in Appendix I and, in the light of the considerations there expressed, the Appendix concludes with the following hypothetical answers : Answer No. 1. The present Members of the Council are the Argentine, Australia, Chile, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Mexico, Portugal, Poland, Russia, Spain and Turkey. Of these, the more doubtful would be the Argentine, Chile, Mexico and Poland, but they could probably all be associated in support of a determined initiative by France and Great Britain.Answer No. 2. The more doubtful League Members would be Switzerland, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Greece, Austria, Albania and the Asiatic and American countries.Answer No. 3. It would be unwise to count on the active co-operation of either the United States, Germany, Japan or Brazil. In the case of any measures at sea being applied which went beyond the American conception of belligerent rights, there would be some danger of the United States becoming definitely obstructive.8. The foregoing observations can, however, be no more than speculative. As regards League Members, it is not easy to foresee what attitude each individual Power will adopt at Geneva.   But it is legitimate to assume that on
an issue so fundamental to the future of the League, where the obligation is so plain, and where each Government will have to assume its responsibilities in public, short-range commercial and even political considerations affecting their own immediate interests may not be the decisive factor. The play of public opinion at Geneva has before now constrained Governments even the Italian Government itself to accept proposals to which they found it impossible to subscribe and were determined not to accept when the Session opened. Furthermore, if it be assumed that Great Britain and France have decided and proclaimed that, in their opinion, there has been a resold to war in violation of the Covenant, and that an occasion has arisen which calls for the application of the measures for which the Covenant provides, it should not be forgotten that they will have done so in the full knowledge that what they are risking is not mere commercial loss, but the system of full collaboration with Italy in Europe which has recently been built up. If France and Great Britain are prepared to take such risks for the sake of the League, then it is not an unreasonable assumption that smaller Powers will be materially influenced in their attitude thereby.9. On the other hand it must be remembered that in any event the effective-ness of the measures which co-operating States might take would vary considerably, and in many cases might only be applied carelessly and half-heartedly.Lastly, it must be borne in mind that Italy on her side will not remain inactive, but will, if she sees any danger of economic pressure being applied against her, try either by blandishments or by threats to immobilise at any rate those countries whose geographical position or economic resources are of special value to her.Italy&apos;s Vulnerability to Economic Pressure.10. There are two aspects of the problem in bringing pressure to bear on Italy:-(a) Italy is weak in essential materials, and is therefore vulnerable both to measures which would directly interrupt these materials reaching her frontiers, and to measures which would prevent her acquiring by export the foreign exchange necessary to purchase them.(b) The Italian Expeditionary Force is in a barren land separated by a greatdistance from its main source of supply.11. As regards (b), we are of the opinion that the considerations involved in interrupting communication with Italy&apos;s Expeditionary Force lie outside our province. The matter is largely concerned with the question of the Suez Canal, and, though we have attached as Appendix VI. a memorandum by the Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office with regard to our legal position in the Canal, yet in this Report we have confined ourselves, generally speaking, to the possibilities of interfering with Italy&apos;s economic life as distinct from the steps of a more military character which could be taken against her lines of communication with Abyssinia.Analysis of Italy&apos;s Dependence on Imports.12. The Fascist Government of Italy aims at making the country as self-supporting as possible in peace and war. The Government has concentrated its efforts in this direction on agriculture, and although Italy is not yet self-supporting in foodstuffs, the situation is improving. There is, however, a grave shortage of nearly all the raw materials required for her industries, and she is nearly entirely dependent on imports for her coal and petroleum.13. A detailed analysis is attached to this Report as Appendix II. The figures employed are those which were immediately available, while retaining the work in as few hands as possible to ensure secrecy. Consequently, the data in some respects may not be entirely up to date, but it is considered that the information employed is sufficiently accurate to substantiate the deductions we have drawn.[11918]- b 2
Volume and Routes of Imports. 14.   It has been estimated that the maximum post-war volume of imports by sea and land in one year is 	Million Tons.By Sea           ...	21-9By Land         ...         ...         ...	71In 1930 seaborne imports reached Italy as follows :- 	Per Cent.Via Gibraltar ...	831Via Suez	3*From within the Mediterranean and Black Sea	1315. There has, however, been a marked tendency on the part of Italy in the past few years to examine and exploit alternative sources of supply in the Black Sea and Eastern Mediterranean, and in favourable circumstances these sources might go far to satisfy her requirements for coal, iron, wheat, petroleum, manganese and some oil seeds.For countries of origin of Italian imports see paragraph 11 of Appendix II.Effect of a Stoppage of Imports by Sea.16. If effective steps could be taken to prevent Italy from importing by sea she would be deprived of some 20 million tons of necessary imports in a year. Unless material stocks had been accumulated, the loss of these imports would very speedily bring her industries to a standstill, although she might not feel the shortage of food-stuffs for some time. The only information available as to reserve stocks in the country indicates that she has some six months&apos; supply of coal, but a census of reserves held last year and a subsequent declaration by the Supreme Committee of Defence indicate that Italy has amassed considerable reserves of all&apos; strategic raw materials. It is reasonable to assume that her accumulated stocks of materials essential for war are sufficient for her to maintain a war of limited effort for several months without further imports, and the Committee&apos;s announcement that the country was independent of outside sources of supply probably related to Italy&apos;s readiness for war with Abyssinia only.17. Apart from the question of reserve stocks there is, indeed, no doubt that Italy is particularly vulnerable to economic pressure, that vulnerability arising partly from geographical and partly from purely economic conditions. As regards the latter, it has been seen that Italy is quite remarkably destitute of raw materials for her industry. Moreover many of the available sources of supply are largely controlled by countries whose co-operation we have provision-ally assumed. It is true that in recent times coal, which was formerly shipped mainly from the United Kingdom, has been imported in increasing quantities from Germany, which is also in a position to supply iron, steel and ferro alloys. Raw cotton also could be obtained from the United States and Brazil, and wool to some extent from Uruguay and the Argentine (if they failed to co-operate) to make up for deficiencies from the Empire. On the other hand, over 90 per cent, of the world&apos;s production of nickel is found in the British Empire, and 40 per cent, of the world&apos;s production of manganese, in addition to a further 33 per cent, in the U.S.S.R. Rubber again is only available in quantity from British Malaya, India, Ceylon and the Netherlands East Indies, whilst supplies of timber, in. which Italy is singularly deficient, are mainly derived from European countries whose co-operation could perhaps be contemplated.18. The geographical conditions are such that it would be very difficult to supply Italy by land routes. Even if Switzerland and Austria were available as channels through which goods could be imported from Germany by rail, the small proportion of Italian imports reaching her by rail is very significant. In recent years, indeed, this proportion has materially declined, and in 1934, whilst over 21 million tons of imports were unloaded in Italian ports, only 3% million tons came by rail. Some half dozen years ago the imports by rail reached double these figures. This may not be the absolute maximum capacity to which railwajf routes could be used in a time of great pressure, but there is, it appears, reason to think that it could not easily be greatly extended. To carry even a proportion of the goods which she normally has to import by sea would bring a strain on
her rail transport which it is doubtful whether she could bear for more than a limited period. The closing of the French and Yugoslavian frontiers would reduce the number of rail and road routes by approximately 50 per cent., and under these conditions it is considered impracticable for Italy to make good deficiencies to an extent which would enable her to maintain her industries.19. The general conclusion, therefore, would seem to be that if a check could be placed on arrivals by sea, the economic pressure on Italy would be very considerable.20. But it cannot be lightly assumed that in the absence of belligerent rights on the part of the countries exercising the pressure the check on imports by sea could be fully secured, and the question whether the Powers applying economic pressure on Italy are or are not in a position to exercise the right of belligerents is one of outstanding importance in regard to the effectiveness of such pressure as regards Italian imports. We have had occasion in previous Reports in regard to the exercise of economic pressure on Germany to draw attention to the opportunities of evasion by the use of non-participating countries as entrepots. Thus in our Report (A.T.B. (E.P.) 10 (also C.I.D. Paper No. 1128-B)) we stated :-&quot; There is reason to anticipate that re-export trade would very soon spring up in non-participating countries .... which it would be impossible to stop without applying a rationing system or similar measure of control to the countries concerned such as could hardly be contemplated in the circumstances envisaged.&quot;Again, in our more recent Report on the French Memorandum for the Exercise of Economic Pressure on Germany without there being a state of war (A.T.B. (E.P.) 24 (also C.I.D. Paper No. 1177-B) ) we drew attention to the similar risk of countries which did not co-operate being used, as sources of indirect supply of the particular commodities with which the French Memorandum was concerned, and we pointed out that this risk could only be avoided &quot; if it were made a condition of the supply of the commodities in question to other countries, that they should take steps to control their re-export,&quot; a course which might involve those countries in a breach of their treaty obliga-tions. It is possible that the Members of the League would be prepared in execution of their obligations under Article 16, to take steps with the object of ensuring that their products should not reach Italy via non-co-operating countries, but the practical difficulties might be considerable. That it would be possible to apply pressure to the United States to prevent her exporting Canadian nickel to Italy (to take a single instance) is almost inconceivable.21. Unless, therefore, the non-Members of the League were prepared to co-operate or at any rate acquiesce in the exercise of economic pressure upon Italy (in which connection the fact that they are parties to the Pact of Paris, which Italy would ex hypothesi have violated, should not be altogether left out of account), it seems probable that before long the vessels of Germany and the United States and other Powers would be found to be engaged in the carriage by sea to Italy not only of goods of their own produce and manufacture, but also goods the produce and manufacture even of countries which had taken all possible steps to avoid supplying Italy. This is not to say that Italy would not be put to much -expense and inconvenience by the altered conditions, but it does suggest that the condition referred to in paragraph 19 above is an essential condition if the pressure is to be sufficiently effective to bring the war in which Italy is engaged to an end.22. We are accordingly driven to the conclusion that, failing co-operation or acquiescence on the part of the non-Member States, the vital condition for the exercise of effective pressure on Italian imports is that we should be able to control arrivals to Italy by sea, for which purpose something of the nature of a blockade, or at least the detention and examination of neutral vessels for contraband would be required, and that accordingly it would only be if we obtained and exercised the rights of belligerents that we could make our pressure effective. This might lead to an outbreak of actual hostilities with Italy which we might then not be able to circumscribe.
23. It may, of course, be suggested that some measure of pressure could be exercised even without these rights which, even if not wholly effective, it might be worth while to adopt, but in this connection it is worth referring to the growing dissatisfaction which would be likely to arise in this country if it appeared, as it would be likely before long to appear, that other countries were capturing trade from us which had formerly been legitimately exercised, and if it were not possible in reply to criticisms to point to the effectiveness of the action we had taken. Even if public opinion in this country could be satisfied, there seems little doubt that other countries which had only half-heartedly adopted a similar policy would soon be found to be conniving at evasions even if they did not openly abandon the policy altogether. It will, of course, be realised that the prohibition of all exports from this country to Italy cannot fail to have considerable injurious effects on British industry, notably on the coal trade, seeing that of the 9 million sterling which is the value in recent years of our exports to Italy, more than 40 per cent, is represented by coal.24. The above considerations do not apply to the question of the stoppage of Italian exports. It is shown in paragraphs 31-33 that such a measure could be made effective to a considerable extent without the countries concerned possessing belligerent rights.Financial Considerations.25. The dominant factor in the economic and financial situation of Italy in recent months has been the effort to maintain the gold value of the lira at the cost of increasing sacrifices and with an ever-diminishing prospect of success. The financial year 1933-34 closed with a real deficit of some  64 millions.* A great effort was made to balance the budget by conversion of the National Debt and salary cuts and curtailment of Public Works, and some  30 millions would have been saved in the first nine months of 1934-35 if it had not been for Abyssinia, t26. The cost of military preparations was apparently  11-g millions up to the end of June. Sir E. Drummond states that it is difficult to see how, if the further 50,000 troops for the expeditionary force are dispatched, the future expenditure can be kept below  40 millions a year thereafter. It will be extremely difficult to finance this by orthodox means. The price of Government securities has again fallen to a 5 per cent, basis, and savings, which increased steadily to the end of 1933, now show signs of drying-up.27. But the experience of all belligerent countries in 1914-18 and the experience of Japan and Germany since the War shows that it is possible for a very long time to finance the internal cost of a war or of preparations for war by inflationary methods. The difficulty which already confronts Italy and is likely to become more and more acute arises from the increase in Italian prices. It was estimated in May last that, since import restrictions were imposed, there-had been a general rise of 4 per cent, in wholesale and 10 per cent, in retail prices and that the price of linseed oil had risen by 80 per cent, in the last month. Imports have been reduced by restriction, but the value of exports has fallen still more and the trade deficit has increased. Commercial debts have become frozen, including over  1 million due to the United Kingdom. The real value of the lira is thus greatly below its nominal gold value and the fall in Government Bonds and national savings and the increase in the price of industrial equities point to the growing distrust of the lira. Thus the military expenditure of Italy is reflected in (i) a lowering of the standard of life, which was already far below that of Western Europe as a whole, and (ii) a scarcity of available raw material for her industries and of other supplies from foreign sources. A devaluation of the lira would ease the position as regards foreign trade, but, if accompanied by inflationary financing of war expenditure, would in the long run lower still further the standard of living.28. The rupture of financial relations between Italy and the United Kingdom would do little to increase the existing difficulties of Italy as outlined above.* Rome despatch No. 1109 of the 31st December, 1934. -f Rome despatch No. 558 E of the 16th May, 1935.
(i) The prohibition of Loans or credits to Italy would not alter the existing position in view of the existing embargo on foreign loans and the very poor credit of Italy in the London market, (ii) Italian investments in the United Kingdom probably do not exceed 2-! millions, the annual yield being some  100,000 a year, (iii) Italy normally obtains over  1 million from British Tourists, but the main Tourist Season will be over by October, and in any case the Tourist Traffic would cease in the circumstances envisaged.29. On the other hand, the rupture of financial (as apart from trade) relations would not in itself cause widespread financial trouble in the United Kingdom.(i) We might lose  1 million a year from investments, &amp;c. The capital value of our investments in Italy is perhaps some  16 millions and individual firms (eg., Courtalds) would suffer serious loss, (ii) British residents in Italy normally receive a considerable income (perhaps  750,000) from the United,Kingdom and the stoppage of these remittances would cause hardship for them, (iii) British Insurance Companies have a large (though not a remunerative) business in Italy which they might permanently lose.30. In short, our financial relations with Italy are comparatively unimportant. But as pointed out in the telegram of the 5th September, 1923, of which a copy is attached as Appendix III, the rupture of financial relations would involve considerable interference with financial operations generally and, in order to be fully effective, would involve postal and cable censorship and other war-time measures. Moreover, the interference with the normal rights of private property, which the severance of financial relations with any foreign country would involve, would be particularly harmful to London in view of its position as the greatest international financial centre, and the harm so done might well be of a lasting character.Italy&apos;s foreign exchange position.31. As stated in paragraph 12 above, one of the main difficulties with which Italy is faced is the scarcity of raw materials and other supplies from foreign sources. The weakness of the Italian foreign exchange position is shown by the reduction in the gold reserve of the Bank of Italy from 7 -1 milliard lire in February 1934 to 5-5 milliard lire ( 92 million sterling on the 10th July, 1935). The imposition of drastic exchange restrictions and the requisition of foreign exchange from Italian Nationals have failed to make it possible to maintain the legal ratio of 40 per cent., and this ratio was suspended on the 21st July &quot; in consideration of the necessity and urgency of procuring the means of making foreign payments of an exceptional character.&quot; The distrust of Italy&apos;s position which is universal abroad is, in fact, already imposing something in the nature -of a financial blockade upon Italy. Both grain merchants and coal merchants in this country are now in many cases refusing to export to Italy unless they receive payment in sterling beforehand. Further, Roumania has recently refused to export oil to Italy unless 60 per cent, of the payment is made in free foreign exchange and not by means of a credit to the Clearing Account.32. These difficulties would inevitably be increased by the actual outbreak &apos;Of war. Military operations are bound to involve a severe drain on various materials which Italy has to purchase abroad. From the nature of the case it is not possible to name any particular date by which it will have become impossible for Italy to continue to feed, clothe and arm her Expeditionary Force, because her stock of raw materials and of gold ( 92 million sterling) is exhausted and she can no longer produce the foreign exchange required to pay for the necessary goods which have to be purchased by her from abroad. It is true that as regards actual munitions Abyssinia would suffer from even greater difficulties in making purchases abroad, but, whatever Abyssinia&apos;s difficulties may be, it remains true that Italy could not continue to conduct a war in Abyssinia unless she can produce sufficient foreign exchange to feed and clothe Italian troops and to supply them with a minimum amount of munitions, including, of course, the petrol required for aeroplanes and motor transport.
33, The difficulty in providing foreign exchange with which Italy is already faced would be immediately accentuated if foreign countries refused to take Italian exports. The Italian member of the Sub-Committee appointed by the &quot; Committee of Thirteen &quot; at Geneva himself emphasised the grave economic damage which would be done to a country by the refusal of other countries to take its exports.Italian Exports.Italy&apos;s chief customers are shown on the following table :  	Percentage of Total				Exports.

Canada; but there would be little danger of Italian exports to the United Kingdom being arranged through the United States of America, since it is not very likely that the United States Chambers of Commerce would give certificates of United States of America origin in respect of goods which really originated from Italy. It should be added that a decision to prohibit the import of Italian goods could to a considerable extent be made effective without any need for the exercise of belligerent rights, and without causing complications with non-members of the League.Stages in the Development of Pressure on Italy.   Legal Position.34. It seems that the possible exercise of pressure on Italy can be divided into stages, as follows :  Stage 1. The possible exercise of pressure in the period prior to Italy&apos;s declaration of war, with the object of preventing her from embarking on her activities against Abyssinia.
zAction Legally Possible before the Outbreak of War.   (See Appendix IV.)36. It appears that economic and financial measures intended to prevent Italy from disturbing the peace can legitimately be taken under Article 11 of the Covenant if the Council recommended* the adoption of such measures. Members are not under an obligation to comply with the recommendations. The measures contemplated must be confined to economic or financial action analogous to those contemplated in paragraph 1 of Article 16, such action being taken without the Members being at war, and, consequently, possessing belligerent rights. The possibility of a &quot; pacific blockade &quot; being imposed under Article 11 must be ruled out, at any rate in this particular case.Action Legally Possible after the Outbreak of War.   (See Appendix V.)37. The conclusions arrived at from an interpretation of Article 16 of the Covenant may be stated to be as follows : (i) The economic and financial measures contemplated in the first paragraph of Article 16 do not involve the use of belligerent rights; they could-(subject to any question as to the rights of non-Members of the League) be applied by steps taken within our own jurisdiction and would not necessarily involve our declaring ourselves to be in a state of war with Italy; (ii) If it became necessary to take action at sea to prevent commercial intercourse between Italy and other States who declined to co-operate or acquiesce in the economic and financial measures taken, this could not be done without the possession of belligerent rights, which would involve the countries concerned declaring themselves to be in a state of war with Italy;(iii) Action at sea in the nature of a blockade directed against the shipping of Italy is perhaps theoretically possible without our declaring ourselves to be at war.It is to be observed that action under (i) might and under (ii) and (iii) almost certainly would involve us in active hostilities with Italy.* The question whether the adverse vote of Italy could prevent such a recommendation being made is unsettled.Stage 2. The possible exercise of pressure by some or all of the Members of the League under Article 16, with the object of terminating Italy&apos;s activities against Abyssinia.Stage 3. The possible extension of the pressure that could be applied under article 16 by inviting non-Members of the League to co-operate with the League in the exercise of such pressure.Stage 4. The possible decision, if non-Members refused to co-operate or some countries, though Members of the League, have not joined in the exercise of pressure, to take the extreme step of treating Italy as actually at war with Great Britain and other Members of the League, and, consequently, making a declaration of war upon her so that they would be in a position to exercise belligerent rights and intercept imports from and exports to non-co-operating countries on the high seas.35. We have obtained an expression of opinion from the Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office as to what measures are considered to be legally possible in the various stages referred to above. These opinions are attached to this Report as Appendices IV and V, and are summarised below. In view, however, of the importance of the matter, the Cabinet may deem it desirable to consult the highest legal authorities on the questions of law involved as regards the provisions of the Covenant under discussion, and also as regards the position in regard to the Suez Canal.   (See Appendix VI.)
38. The following general conclusions can be drawn from the foregoing considerations:  (1) italy&apos;s susceptibility to pressure has two aspects. There is, first, her weakness in essential materials from which she is separated either by considerable sea distances or by land communications whose capacity it would be difficult to increase. She is therefore vulnerable both to measures which would interrupt these materials reaching her frontiers, and to measures which would prevent her acquiring by-export the foreign exchange necessary to purchase them. Secondly, there is the existence of an Expeditionary Force separated from Home supplies by the Suez Canal. Examination of the effectiveness of any pressure has, however, been confined to the economic and financial field as the interruption of communication with Italy&apos;s Expeditionary Force appears to involve considerations mainly of a military character. At the same time, Appendix VI contains an opinion as to what is legally possible as regards the closing of the Suez Canal.(2) Italy&apos;s geographical characteristics and her lack of essential raw materials and fuels render her particularly vulnerable to economic pressure. This pressure would be very considerable if the products of countries co-operating could be altogether withheld from Italy and if, in addition, some further check could be placed on arrivals by sea. It is reasonable to assume that her accumulated stocks of materials essential for war are sufficient for her to maintain a war.of limited effort, such as against Abyssinia, for several months without further imports.(3) It seems most unlikely that any economic or financial action taken against Italy now under either Article 11 or Article 13 could have time to prove effective before the autumn, when she might be expected &apos;to embark on hostilities with Abyssinia, and no attempt has been made to estimate the response that might be expected from a recommenda-tion to exercise pressure under these&quot; Articles.(4) For the purposes of reporting upon the effectiveness of the pressure which could be exercised under Article 16, we have assumed that the resort to war by Italy was flagrant, gross and undisguised and that the Council had either by unanimous vote been able to give an &quot; opinion &quot; to this effect or had only been formally prevented from doing so by the adverse vote of Italy. No attempt has been made to examine the possibility of individual action by Great Britain, and the assumption as to the Council&apos;s decision must be based on the supposition that France and Great Britain had taken a lead in proposing it. The probability, in practice, of such co-operation by France being forthcoming is not commented upon.(5) However clear the obligation of Member States may be to impose economic pressure on a State violating Article 16 of the Covenant, the fact must be faced that several of them, when called upon to take the necessary measures against Italy, may be influenced in the opposite sense by certain political and commercial considerations. In our present uncertainty as to how the situation is going to develop it is impossible to tell what force these various considerations will exercise upon individual States, since it will vary according to the particular circumstances of each. But it is certain that they will have considerably less weight if the Governments in question are sure that their competitors will not capture their share of the Italian market, and that they themselves will not be left alone to face the anger and possible retaliation of Italy. Their attitude will, therefore, largely depend upon the lead which they receive from France and Great Britain : in fact, th.ey must be convinced that Great Britain and France are themselves taking not only economic but political risks to the extent, if necessary, of exercising belligerent rights, and that they will not leave the lesser countries in the lurch either during or after the period of economic pressure. The play of public opinion at Geneva is also likely to influence hesitant Governments to shoulder
their League obligations, which, so long as viewed from the domestic angle, they might be tempted to avoid on economic or political grounds.(6) As regards the non-Member States, it would be unwise to count on the active co-operation of either the United States, Germany, Japan or Brazil (in spite of the recent pronouncements made by the United States and Japanese Governments); though it is perhaps possible that one or more of them might be prepared, as parties to the Pact of Paris, to acquiesce in the exercise of pressure upon Italy.&apos;(7) It seems likely that collective economic and financial sanctions against Italy, with the object of terminating a state of war between her and Abyssinia, would, so far as concerns imports into Italy, only prove successful within a reasonable period of time if it was accompanied by the exercise of belligerent rights and an effective stoppage of her seaborne trade. If the other Powers did not exercise belligerent rights against her, they could not prevent her from trading by sea with the non-participating States, and more especially with the non-Member States. Further, without the powers for the exercise of something in the nature of a blockade, or at least the detention and examination of neutral vessels for contraband, it is to be anticipated that a re-export trade in non-participating countries would soon spring up which it would be difficult, if not impossible, to stop, and which would greatly assist Italy in overcoming the closing of the direct channels of trade communication between her and the participating countries.-(8) It may be suggested that some advantage might still be gained by the application of the limited pressure which would be possible without the exercise of belligerent rights, but such would result in the capture of much of our trade by other countries, and it would be difficult to justify this loss unless we could point to the effectiveness of the action taken. Further, under such conditions, there seems little doubt that those other countries which might only half-heartedly adopt a similar policy would soon be found to be conniving at evasions even if they did not openly abandon the policy altogether.(9) The exercise of belligerent rights without which, failing co-operation or acquiescence on the part of States not Members of the League, effective restriction of Italian imports could not be brought to bear, is permissible under Article 16 and action at sea in the nature of a blockade directed against the shipping of Italy is theoretically possible without declarations of war upon Italy. This would iii practice, however, almost inevitably lead to active hostilities, most probably at sea, and thus involve the Naval Powers in the first instance.(10) Financial pressure in the form of the prohibition of loans and credits to Italy and the severance of financial relations would not be effective, since Italy is already unable to borrow abroad owing to her lack of credit and does not normally derive any large income from foreign investments.(11) Italy&apos;s difficulties in buying certain essential raw materials from abroad are already considerable owing to her lack of foreign exchange resources (apart from her gold reserve of some  90 millions) and her inability to buy on credit as a consequence of the distrust of her financial position &quot;and of the stability of the lira. The refusal of &quot;participating countries&quot; to import Italian goods would greatly enhance these difficulties, but we have no means of estimating when this particular financial pressure will take effect or how serious it will be when it does take effect. Again, the effectiveness of such a measure would be seriously diminished by the non-participation of Germany, the United States of America and the Argentine, which together take 27-g- per cent, of Italian exports. It should be added that a decision to prohibit the import of Italian goods could to a considerable extent be made effective without any need for the exercise of belligerent rights, and without causing complications with non-members of the League.
APPENDIX I.International Co-operation in the Exercise of Pressure on Italy.HOWEVER clear the obligation of Member States may be to impose economic pressure on Italy, we must face the fact that several of them when called upon to take the necessary measures may be influenced in the opposite sense by certain political and commercial considerations. These considerations may be summarised as follows : (1) Italian trade may be of great value to certain States; especially at this time of economic distress. In such cases commercial and financial interests may be expected to try to resist any attempt to interrupt trade relations with Italy. As examples of such countries may be mentioned Roumania, who exports to Italy a great deal of her oil; Switzerland, who has. a large trade with Italy and an unfavourable trade balance which she is very anxious to reduce by negotiations; Yugoslavia, who finds in Italy the chief market for her exports (20 per cent, of her total exports go to Italy); and Austria, who has been working hard and with considerable success to improve her general financial situation by increasing her export trade to Italy.The following list shows the relative value of the Italian market to various Member States : Per cent.Exports to Italy from- of Whole.Albania        ...... 62-6Argentina     ...       ... 6-2Austria        ...... 10-8Belgium        ...       ... 1-2Bulgaria       ...       ... 9-2Czechoslovakia        ... 3-2Dutch East Indies ... 1-4France          ...       ... 2-1Greece          ...      ... 9-8Holland        ...... 1-3Hungary       ...       ... 8-2Poland         ...       ... 4-1Roumania     ...       .... 9-2Spain           ...       ... 3-0Switzerland  ...      ... 8-0Turkey         ...... 11-4U.S.S.R.       ... .      50Yugoslavia    ...       ... 2.0-5Remarks.Bulk of Albanian trade. Third place in Austrian trade. Second place in Bulgarian trade.Third place in Hungarian trade.Fourth place in Roumanian trade.Third place in Swiss trade. Third place in Turkish trade.First place in Yugoslav trade.(2) There may be certain countries who for political reasons will decide the issue by adopting the opposite line to that adopted by countries with whom they are at strained relations. Possibly Poland, Hungary and Bulgaria, for instance, may be tempted to act contrary to Russia, the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente in this matter.(3) There are certain Member States who are fundamentally so weak that they may fear to become involved in a direct quarrel with a Great Power. If they applied economic pressure to Italy they might argue that it would be used as a precedent to force them subsequently to apply similar pressure to Germany. It should, however, be observed that in the Manchurian dispute the Little Powers were the most vocal in favour of positive action by the League; that many of them regard the Covenant as the sheet anchor of their independence; and that those which are not territorially contiguous to Italy may feel that they can safely join the other Great Powers in action in which the latter must inevitably bear the brunt.
The case of Switzerland is peculiar, since it has always been a fundamental tenet of her policy to avoid international&apos; commitments, and this consideration would, weigh with particular force in a case where she was asked to take action not only against a Great Power, but also against a neighbour.(4) There are two countries to whom Italian goodwill is of such vital importance that it is - difficult to believe that they could afford to break off commercial relations with her.  These are Austria and Albania.(5) There are Italy&apos;s actual neighbours, who, for present purposes, may be considered to consist (apart from France) of Switzerland, Austria, Yugoslavia, Albania and Greece. It may be assumed that all these will consider carefully the immediate and ulterior political effects of their breaking off commercial relations with Italy. The cases of Switzerland, Austria and Albania have already been dealt with. As regards Yugoslavia and Greece, the position is more doubtful. Yugoslavia^ policy at the present time is one of sitting on the fence and not committing herself to any of the Powers who are courting her favour. It is not altogether unlikely that she would in this instance refuse to take any active measures which might prejudice for an indefinite period her future relations with Italy, especially when it is remembered that we and France are continually urging her to come to an understanding with Italy. On the other hand, given her long-standing mistrust and suspicion of Italy, she may well be prepared to follow a lead by France and the United Kingdom. The same considerations apply, but perhaps with somewhat less force, to Greece.(6) Lastly, there are the Member States in South and Central America and Asia, who are so distant and consider themselves so divorced from what they would regard as a purely European quarrel, that they will, to say the least of it, be none too anxious to take any active measures.In our present uncertainty as to how the situation is going to develop, it is impossible to tell what force these various considerations will exercise when the various States concerned are called upon to make up their minds, but it is certain that they will have considerably less weight in the counsels of the Governments if the latter are sure that their competitors will not capture their share of the Italian market, and that they themselves will not be left to face alone the anger and possible retaliation of Italy.   -In short, the attitude of other Members of the League may be expected to depend very largely upon the lead which they receive from France and Great Britain. If they receive a determined lead, it is improbable that they would refuse to co-operate to a greater or lesser extent in action recommended by the Council on an issue which cannot fail to be universally recognised as a test of the League&apos;s ability to curb an aggressor. But and this is a sine qua non they must be convinced that Great Britain and France really mean business to the extent, if necessary, of exercising belligerent rights; and that they will not leave the lesser countries in the lurch, either during or after the period of economic pressure.The exercise of belligerent rights by the two great maritime Powers would no doubt afford the necessary conviction on this head. Moreover, while it would not relieve the other Members of the League of their obligation to take effective steps to sever commercial relations with Italy, it might, to some extent (except in the case of the three limitrophe States) relieve them of the odium for the interruption of Italian trade.As to the big non-League States, i.e., the United States, Germany, Japan and Brazil, it is doubtful whether it would be wise to count on the co-operation of any of them, although the fact that they are all parties to the Briand-Kellogg Pact, which Italy would ex hypothesi have violated, should not be left altogether out of account. The most important of these, from the political point of view, is, of course, the United States, who is most unlikely to co-operate actively. It is true that when the United States reply to the Ethiopian appeal was generally interpreted as a gesture of indifference, the State Department (as a result, it is said, of pressure by Pacifist elements) informed the Italian Ambassador, both verbally and in writing, (a) of their deep interest in preserving peace in all parts of the world, and particularly in the international arrangements designed for that purpose, and (b) of their increasing concern over the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. The State Department, moreover, informed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador and the French Ambassador of these representations, and asked that the United States Government might be kept informed of developments.   On the other hand,
Sir Ronald Lindsay&apos;s comment on the above was that &apos;&apos;. the attitude of the United States Government is, and will continue to be, dictated purely by considerations of internal politics, which are strongly adverse to anything even remotely likely to involve the United States in complications.&quot; It may, therefore, be said that the most the United States Government would be likely to. do would be to prohibit trade with both belligerents, and even this. would require Congressional authority. There has been much talk lately in the United States about &quot;taking the profit out of war,&quot; and there are several projects before Congress for ensuring American neutrality in any future war which may break out. But it is, at best, doubtful whether any practical effect would be given to a proposal to prohibit trade with both belligerents, and, in the absence of any such measures, the United States Government would be likely to take up their traditional policy of objecting to any attempt by naval Powers to interfere with American goods on the high seas, except within such limits of belligerent rights as the United States may be disposed to recognise.Germany is commercially perhaps the most important, from Italy&apos;s point of view, of the countries which are not active members of the League of Nations. So far as Germany is concerned, there is little likelihood that Berr Hitler would be prepared to exercise economic pressure upon Italy in connection with the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. On the 20th May last Sir Eric Phipps reported that &quot; Herr Hitler openly says that the Abyssinians are a non-Arayan race, who do not interest him, and that Italy is welcome to swallow them up as she likes. The German press, moreover, has shown unusual restraint in discussing Abyssinia.&quot; On the 7th June Sir Eric Phipps reported that, according to his information, the German police, naval, military and air authorities had been instructed to see that no German ammunition or war material went to Abyssinia, and that the Italian Government had been informed that this step had been taken. It must, moreover, be remembered that German opinion is entirely opposed to the very principles of international action under the League Covenant, and is only prepared to act when German national interests are at stake.Brazil, where the Government and public opinion are also far from sympathetic to the League of Nations, is almost equally certain to maintain a non-committal attitude.The case of Japan&apos;s relations with Italy is not quite so simple as might first appear. It might be thought that Japan, having left the League, would naturally sympathise with the country having to face a similar decision and for more or less similar reasons. Such expression of public opinion as we have had from Japan, however, points to sympathy with Abyssinia. There is also the fact that Italy&apos;s pushing policy in China is irritating to Japan, and that Japan has large and growing commercial interests in Abyssinia. It is not suggested that all this would be enough to ensure Japan&apos;s active co-operation with the League, and it is probable that she would be far from endorsing such a measure as the closing of the Suez Canal, if only because she would be apprehensive of a precedent in her own case in some hypothetical future conflict. But, on the whole, it would seem safe to assume that Japan would certainly not assist Italy against the League. She might even go as far as to follow up a protest to Italy by offering some form of collaboration to Abyssinia. She has, after all, little to fear from Italian resentment, either in the Far East or elsewhere. At the same time it must be clear that, if Japan takes up a critical attitude towards Italy, it will not be for the sake of any League principles, but purely with an eye to her own interests, either commercial or political, and the furtherance of these interests, in Egypt and in Africa generally, would not be a welcome prospect to us. We should, in short, be extremely careful not to solicit Japanese co-operation, and only accept it, if offered, with the greatest caution.In tne light of these considerations, it is possible to venture the following hypothetical answers to the three questions raised in this Report:_Question No. 1. Would any Council Member be likely to abstain&quot;&quot;from votino-for the Council&apos;s &quot; opinion,&quot; not because they disputed the facts, but because for political or economic reasons they were resolved not to impose economic pressure on Italy ?Answer No. 1. -The present Members of the Council are the Argentine, Australia,  Chile, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Mexico&quot; Portugal, Poland, Russia, Spain and Turkey.  Of these, the more doubtful would [11913;; B 2
be the Argentine, Chile, Mexico and Poland, but they could probably all be associated in support of a determined initiative by France and Great Britain.Question No. 2. To what extent would League Members not on the Council endorse the Council&apos;s &quot;opinion&quot; by applying economic pressure?Answer No. 2. The more doubtful League Members would be Switzerland, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Greece, Austria, Albania and the Asiatic and American countries.Question No. 3. What would be the attitude of the big non-Member States ?Answer No. 3. It would be unwise to count on the active co-operation of either the United States, Germany, Japan or Brazil. In the case of any measures at sea being applied which went beyond the American conception of belligerent rights, there would be some danger of the United States becoming definitely obstructive.The foregoing observations can, however, be no more than speculative. As regards League Members, it is not eas)^ to foresee what attitude each individual Power will adopt at Geneva. But it is legitimate to assume that on an issue so fundamental to the future of the League, where the obligation is so plain, and where each Government will have to assume its responsibilities in public, short-range commercial and even political considerations affecting their own immediate interests may not be the decisive factor. The play of public opinion at Geneva has before now constrained Governments even the Italian Government itself to accept proposals to which they found it impossible to subscribe and were determined not to accept when the session opened.Furthermore, if it be assumed that Great Britain and France have decided and proclaimed that, in their opinion, there has been a resort to war in violation of the Covenant, and that an occasion has arisen which calls for the application of the measures for which the Covenant provides, it should not be forgotten that they will have done so in the full knowledge that what they are risking is not mere commercial loss, but the system of full collaboration with Italy in Europe which has recently been built up. If France and Great Britain are prepared to take such risks for the sake of the League, then it is not an &quot;unreasonable assump-tion that smaller Powers will be materially influenced in their attitude thereby.
APPENDIX II.Detailed Analysis of Italy&apos;s Economic Vulnerability.Foodstuffs.1. THE Government policy of self-sufficiency has succeeded in reducing the weight of imported foodstuffs from 3-64 million tons in 1930 to 1-49 million tons in 1933.   The imports in 1933 were chiefly composed of -: Tons.Cereals        ... ... ... ...      661,000Meat ... ... ... ...        50,000Fish ... ... ... ...        85,000It is noteworthy that all Italy&apos;s requirements of fertilisers can now be met, provided imports of phosphate rock from Tripoli can be maintained.Fuel and Power.2. There is a grave deficiency of coal, petroleum and wood in Italy. This lack of natural sources of power is one of the weakest spots in the industrial and economic situation. An increasing use of water power relieves but cannot solve the problem.With regard to coal, Italy&apos;s output is only about 50,000 tons of hard coal and under 1 million tons of lignite annually, and in spite of the increased develop-ment of hydro-electric power, it is difficult to see how Italy can avoid importing about 10 million tons of coal and coke a year. (The maximum post-war importa-tion was 14 million tons and in 1932 was 8f million tons.)Sources of supply of Italy&apos;s coal imports in 1932 were : United Kingdom 5 million tons, Germany 1-j million tons, Poland and U.S.S.R. \ million tons each, but imports from Germany have greatly increased recently, and in 1934, out of total imports of llf million tons, 4-g- million tons were derived from Germany and a like quantity from the United Kingdom, Poland being responsible for over a million tons.Stocks equivalent to about 6 months&apos; supply are reported to be held, but the cessation of further imports would eventually involve the collapse of Italian industry.Petroleum.3. Annual requirements of petroleum in all forms are now about 2 million tons, of which domestic sources of supply provide only about 25,000 tons raised in the province of Parma (in Emilia).A Government Decree of July 1934, recognising this deficiency, aims at the xapid erection of refining plants for treating crude oil from Italian interests in Albania and Roumania and the maintenance of reserves of petroleum. At present imports from Albania are small, and she relies on seaborne imports from Roumania, U.S.S.R., the United States of America and Persia. Any one of these countries is capable of meeting Italy&apos;s total requirements, and Dutch sources of supply could also do so.The present capacity of tank storage is estimated at 750,000, but it is reported that it is intended to increase this to allow of holding a reserve equal to one year&apos;s estimated war requirements.Electric Power.4. In view of the absence of fuel, the electric power industry is one of the most important in Italy. It has made rapid progress under Government super-vision in the last few years, and current is now conveyed all over the country by a vast grid system. It is claimed that the installations have been constructed so as to be relatively immune from air attack.
Metallurgical Industries and Materials.Iron and Steel.5. The annual capacity production of iron-ore is only about 1^ million tons, mainly from Elba and Sardinia. The Italian steel industry depends&apos; largely on imported pig-iron and the capacity production of the steel industry is about 3^ million tons annually (cf. Germany, whose maximum post-war production is over 16 million tons). Italy also imports a quantity of scrap. In spite of these imports of ore, scrap and pig-iron, she still has to import finished steel to meet the requirements of her engineering industries.In order to maintain her industries at a high level, it is estimated that Italy would have to import annually ^ million tons of iron-ore. 1 million tons of scrap.1 million tons of semi-finished iron and steel products.50,000 tons of special and tool steel (50 per cent, of requirements).Non-ferrous Metals.6. Italy is well provided with bauxite and quicksilver and has some lead and zinc (Sardinia and Trentino). In a year of high industrial effort she would need to import all the nickel, copper and tin, half the lead and one-third the zinc.It has been estimated that, in a war of national effort, the amounts of non-ferrous metals she would have to import would be : -Thousand tons. Copper ... ... ... ...      50-70Lead ... ... ... ...       30-40Zinc ... ... ... ...       15-30Tin ... ... ... ...        5-7Nickel ... ... ... ...        2Apart from components and finished goods containing these metals. Ferro-alloys.7. Italy is dependent on imports for nearly all ferro-alloys required for her steel industry, and imports, amongst others, nearly 100,000 tons of manganese annually.Chemicals.8. Italy has ample supplies of salt and sulphur and a flourishing dye industry; the coal or coal-tar for the latter must be imported. Something under 2 million tons of organic or inorganic chemicals are now imported annually.Textiles.9. The textile industry employs nearly 50 per cent, of the nation&apos;s industrial workers and is the most important national industry after agriculture. The textile industry meets all Home requirements, but the raw material situation is as follows :  Home Source. Imported.Silk    ........... 100% Nil.Cotton            ....          .... Negligible. 200,000 tons.Wool ....          ....         .... 30,000 tons. 85,000 tons.Flax   ....          ....          .... 2,300 tons. 1,000 tons.Hemp                          .... 100% Nil (exports).Jute   ....          ....         .... Nil. 50,000 tons.Rubber.10. Italy is dependent on imports for all her rubber, approximately 20,000 tons per annum, from British India and Netherlands East Indies. There-are no alternative sources of supply.Timber.Italy has very limited supply of timber and imports annually about If million, tons, chiefly from Australia, Yugoslavia and U.S.S.R.
Oil Seeds, &amp;c.Upwards of \ million tons of seeds, nuts, vegetable oils, &amp;c, are imported annually.Imports by Countries.11. Imports by volume from the principal countries in 1932 (when total imports were 17-69 million tons) were : Million Tons.United KingdomRoumaniaGermanyU.S.S.R.ArgentinaU.S.A.YugoslaviaAustriaFranceIndia and MalaySwitzerlandBrazilEgyptHeaviest Imports.5 - 30 Coal.5-30 Timber, oil/vegetables.1-85 Coal and machinery.1 - 35 Coal, wheat, wood, oil.-99 Cereals, hay, wheat.-73 Cotton, oil, minerals.- 56 Timber.-40 Timber and cellulose.-35 Steel, minerals, chemicals.-22 Oil-seeds, jute, rubber.- 07 Iron.- 04 Coffee.-01 Cotton, phosphates.Imports from British Empire.12. Stoppage of imports from the British Empire would force Italy to find alternative sources of supply for about half her coal and the greater proportion of her requirements in rubber, jute and oil seeds.Recent increases of imports of strategic raw materials.13. Figures of Italian imports for the first three months of 1935 indicate substantial increases of goods of military significance as compared with the same period last year.Ordnance and Ammunition and parts thereof LeadCrude copper Aluminium Ferro-alloys Nickel    ... Manganese ore Machine tools GlycerineThe attention of the Board of Trade has been drawn to the exceptionally high price for old ships from this country and elsewhere which the Italians are prepared to offer, which indicates there is a ready market in Italy for scrap iron.Exports.14. Italy&apos;s chief exports are textiles (30 per cent, of total), fruit and vege-tables (20 per cent, of total), engineering products (10 per cent, of total).The engineering industry, to a great extent, and the textile industry, in all but silk, are both dependent on the imports of raw materials. Germany, Great Britain, Switzerland, United States of America and France are her principal customers. Great Britain is the principal purchaser of dried and preserved fruit and vegetables.Shipping.15. Recognising its importance, the Italian Government has made every effort to expand and maintain the shipbuilding industry. About 350,000,000 lire was paid as subsidies in one form or another in 1933.1934.	1935.Tons.	tons	126871	1,77519,000	28,000Negligible	1176	50247	54012,000	28,000950	1,580195	600
The number of steam and motor ships in the Italian Mercantile Marine (1934-35) is 1,031 ships representing 2,875,179 gross tonnage. (Included in this figure is 65 commercial tankers and 15 naval oilers.)Trade by Flags.About 52 per cent, of the volume of inward seaborne trade and about 75 per cent, of outward seaborne trade is carried by Italian shins.Overland Frontiers Facilities for Transport.Railways.16. There are thirteen railway systems between Italy and her neighbouring countries : From France       :..          ... ... ...      2From Switzerland ...          ... ... ...      4From Austria       ...          ... ... ...      from Yugoslavia ...          ... ... ...      413Roads.There are some 20 roads entering Italy, of which at least 6, and possibly 9,are first-class motor roads, the chief ones being :-From. France        ... ... ... ... from Switzerland .... ... ... 4From Austria       ... ... ... ... 1From Yugoslavia ... ... ... ... 1and 11 more not yet specially adapted for motor traffic.    (This information isdated 1929, and it is probable that facilities have been improved since this date.)Peace-Time Traffic dealt with.17. It has been estimated that the railways dealt with 10 million tons of goods annually, and, in addition, a very large passenger traffic.In order to transport the volume of goods normally imported by sea, it would be necessary to treble the normal railway traffic figures.In war time the situation would be eased by the practical cessation of passenger traffic and the restricting of imports to essentials. On the other hand, the railways would presumably have to bear an added share of the burden of export, failing which the foreign credit of the country would rapidly fall and the purchase of essential raw materials for import become impossible.It is considered probable that Italy could, by using her railways and roads to the utmost, make good her loss of seaborne imports over her land frontiers to some extent, but that the strain on the traffic facilities could probably only be maintained for a limited period, and that the closing of the French and Yugoslavian frontiers would reduce these facilities by 50 per cent.APPENDIX III.Telegram, to Lord R. Cecil, dated September 5, 1923. FOLLOWING for Lord Robert Cecil :-&quot; In view of possibility of League action having to be taken against Italy the various departments concerned have been warned to study Article 16 and measures that would be entailed by its strict application. Other departments have not so far expressed their views but Treasury are seriously perturbed at the consequences of a literal application of the Article.&quot; Following are their views which are sent you for your general guidance should the matter take serious shape. But you naturally wOuld not in any case commit His Majesty&apos;s Government to any course of action without first consulting us fully.
APPENDIX IV.Action Legally Possible before the Outbreak of War between Italy and Abyssinia.AS regards the possibility of action being taken before the outbreak of hostilities between Italy and Abyssinia with a view to preventing Italy from embarking on such hostilities, the position appears to be as follows. The question whether economic and financial measures, intended to prevent a State which is threatening to disturb the peace from carrying out its intention, can legitimately be taken under the provision of Article 11 of the Covenant, by which &quot; the League shall take any action that may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations,&quot; has recently been considered by a Committee of Jurists at Geneva, who reported unanimously that such action could be legitimately taken. The procedure contemplated is that the Council should recommend* to the members of the League, or certain of them, the adoption of the measures in question; the Council can only recommend, and the members of the League are not under an obligation to comply with the recommendation.The measures with which the Jurists&apos; Report dealt, being confined to economic or financial action, were analogous to those contemplated in the first paragraph of Article 16, which are to be taken by the members of the League within their own jurisdiction. Such action could (subject to any difficulties which might arise from such matters as commercial treaties, &amp;c.) be taken by the members of the League without their being at war and consequently possessing belligerent rights.The jurists did not consider the possibility of measures like action at sea with a view to putting pressure upon the State concerned by the interruption of its commerce. It is true that the possibility of a &quot; pacific blockade&quot; being imposed under Article 11 has been suggested in the past, but in the circumstances of the present case it would seem that any such possibility must be ruled out. Apart from a &quot; pacific blockade &quot; it would not be possible to take any action at sea under Article 11, with a view to preventing the outbreak of hostilities by putting pressure* The question whether the adverse vote of Italy could prevent such a recommendation being made is unsettled.&quot; &apos; To give effect to the undertaking contained in the first paragraph of Article 16 of the Covenant, it would be necessary to impose, forthwith, ^ control of all foreign correspondence, all foreign credit operations including remittances abroad, and of the whole of import and export trade of the Kingdom, in short to re-establish the following war-time departments with full war-time powers : Postal and Cable Censorship;Foreign Trade and Blockade Departments, and the Trading with the Enemy Department of the Treasury.&quot; &apos; It would have to be made a legal offence to correspond (directly or indirectly) with any person resident in the offending State, to enter (directly or indirectly) into any commercial or financial contract with or for the benefit of such a person, to complete any such transaction already entered into, to remit money to any such person, to accept, pay, or discount any bill drawn by or held for such a person, &amp;c. No bank, accepting house, stockbroker or trader, could accept any order or instruction or buy or sell any goods to any resident abroad, unless satisfied that there was no direct or indirect benefit to a person resident in the offending State. This would involve the imposition of the war-time system of declarations before any business could be entertained. No banker could open any foreign credit, or allow any drawing against a confirmed foreign credit, or remit money abroad without a declaration; no person could export or import goods without an undertaking that the origin or destination of the goods was not the offending State. The result would be a complete stoppage of all foreign business and all imports and exports until such time as declarations could be obtained&apos;.&quot;
on the State concerned, and, generally speaking, it seems clear that any action at sea which could not be taken under Article 16 without the Powers concerned possessing belligerent rights could not be taken under Article 11, where no state of war exists at all.APPENDIX V.Interpretation of Article 16 of the Covenant of the League.THE terms of Article 16 are as follows : &quot;1. Should any Member of the League resort to war in disregard of its , covenants under Articles 12, 13 or 15, it shall ipso facto be deemed to have committed an act of, war against all other Members of the League, which hereby undertake immediately to subject it to the severance of all trade or financial relations, the prohibition of all intercourse between their nationals and the nationals of the covenant-breaking State, and the prevention of all financial, commercial or personal intercourse between the nationals of the covenantTbreaking State and the nationals of any other State, whether a Member of the League or not.2. It shall be the duty of the Council in such case to recommend to the several Governments concerned what effective military, naval or air force the Members of the League shall severally contribute to the armed forces to be used to protect the covenants of the League.3. The Members of the League agree, further, that they will mutually support one another in the financial and economic measures which are taken under this Article, in order to minimise the loss and inconvenience resulting from the ,above measures, and that they will mutually support one another in resisting any special measures aimed at one of their number by the covenant-breaking State, and that they will take the necessary steps to afford passage through their territory to the forces of any of the Members of the League which are co-operating to protect the covenants of the League.4. Any Member of the League which has violated any covenant of the League may he declared to be no longer a Member of the League by a vote of the Council concurred in by the Representatives of all the other Members of the League represented thereon.&quot;Article 16 has never yet been applied, and consequently there are no precedents to guide us as to what is likely to happen in practice. The subject has, however, been studied to some extent in the past by various League bodies, and the results of these studies throw a certain amount of light on the problems before the Committee, though any conclusions reached must be to some extent provisional. It will be appreciated, of course, that this note is not intended to be anything in the nature of a complete commentary on Article 16,In 1921 the Assembly adopted certain resolutions relating to Article 16 which were intended to become amendments to the article; as such they have never come into force owing to the lack of the requisite number of ratifications. Of these resolutions, the most material for present purposes are as follows :-&quot; The second paragraph of Article 16 shall read as follows : &apos; It is for the Council to give an opinion whether or not a breach of the Covenant has taken place. In deliberations on this question in the Council, the votes of Members of the League alleged to have resorted to war and of Members against whom such action was directed shall not be counted.&apos; &quot;&quot; The third paragraph of Article 16 shall read as follows : &apos; The Council will notify to all Members of the League the date which it recommends for the application of the economic pressure under this Article.&apos; &quot;
&quot; The fourth paragraph of Article 16 shall read as follows : &apos; Nevertheless, the Council may, in the case of particular Members, post-pone the coming into force of any of these measures for a specified period where it is satisfied that such a postponement will facilitate the attainment of the object of the measures referred to in the preceding paragraph, or that it is necessary in order to minimise the loss and inconvenience which will be caused to such Members.&apos; &quot;The Assembly at the same time adopted a set of resolutions dealing with the application of Article 16. The most important of these for present purposes are as follows : it will be seen that the first deals with the position both of the resolutions themselves and of the proposed amendments to Article 16 so long as the latter had not come into force.&quot; The Assembly adopts the following resolutions :  1. The resolutions and the proposals for amendments to Article 16 which have been adopted by the Assembly shall, so long as the amendments have not been put in force in the form required by the Covenant, constitute rules for guidance which the Assembly recommends, as a provisional measure, to the Council and to the Members of the League in connection with the application of Article 16.2...........3. The unilateral action of the defaulting State cannot create a state of war : it merely entitles the other Members of the League to resort to acts of war or to declare themselves in a state of war with the covenant-breaking State; but it is in accordance with the spirit of the Covenant that the League of Nations should attempt, at least at the outset, to avoid war, and to restore peace by economic pressure.4. It is the duty of each Member of the League to decide for itself whether a breach of the Covenant has been committed. The fulfilment of of their duties under Article 16 is required from Members of the League by the express terms of the Covenant, and they cannot neglect them without breach of their Treaty obligations.5. All cases of breach of Covenant under Article 16 shall be referred to the Council as a matter of urgency at the request of any Member of the League. Further, if a breach of Covenant be committed, or if there arise a danger of such breach being committed, the Secretary-General shall at once give notice thereof to all the Members of the Council. Upon receipt of such a request by a Member of the League, or of such a notice by the Secretary-General, the Council will meet as soon as possible. The Council shall summon representatives of the parties to the conflict and of all States which are neighbours of the defaulting State, or which normally maintain close economic relations with it, or whose co-operation would be especially valuable for the application of Article 16.6. If the Council is of opinion that a State has been guilty of a breach of the Covenant, the Minutes of the meeting at which that opinion is arrived at shall be immediately sent to all Members of the League, accompanied by a statement of reasons and by an invitation to take action accordingly. The fullest publicity shall be given to this decision.7......&apos;.....8. The Council shall recommend the date on which the enforcement of economic pressure, under Article 16, is to be begun, and shall give notice of that date to all the Members of the League.9. Ail States must be treated alike as regards the application of the measures of economic pressure, with the following reservations : .(a) It may be necessary to recommend the execution of special measuresby certain States.(b) If it is thought desirable to postpone, wholly or partially, in the caseof certain States, the effective application of the economic sanctions laid down in Article 16, such postponement shall not be permitted, except in so far as it is desirable for the success of the common plan of action, or reduces to a minimum the losses and embarrassments which may be entailed in the case of certain Members of the League by the application of the sanctions. [11918] D
10...........11. .... . . . . . .12. . .......13............14. In cases of prolonged application of economic pressure, measures of increasing stringency may be taken. The cutting-off of the food supplies of the civil population of the defaulting State shall be regarded as an extremely drastic measure, which shall only be applied if the other measures available are clearly inadequate.15. . . . . . . . ... .... r &apos; &apos;-   &apos;   16...........       . .  ;   . ..    ,17.  .......... i18. In special circumstances and in support of economic measures to be taken, it may become advisable : (a) to establish an effective blockade of the seaboard of the covenant-breaking State; (&amp;) to entrust to some Members of the League the execution of the blockade operations.&quot;The precise legal position of these resolutions is perhaps somewhat uncertain. J3ut in so far as they are not inconsistent with the terms of Article 16 as it stands (and they are so only to a limited extent), there seems no reason to suppose that they would not be treated in accordance with Resolution No. 1, as rules for guidance recommended to the Council and to the Members of the League. The Council intimated in 1922 that it would &quot; shnspirer des recommendations de 1&apos;Assemblee.&quot;It is accordingly contemplated that the Council should give an opinion as to whether a breach of the Covenant has taken place which brings Article 16 into application. In view of the fact that the unratified amendment of 1921 provides expressly for excluding the votes of the parties to the dispute, it would seem (though the contrary is arguable) that the adverse vote of the State alleged to have violated the Covenant would prevent the Council from adopting a reso-lution stating that in its opinion such a breach of the Covenant had taken place. But a resolution adopted by all the Members of the Council except the guilty State would have, from the point of view of its effect upon the Members of the League, practically the same result as a resolution which had been formally adopted by unanimity.In any case what the Council gives is only an opinion, and it is for each Member of the League to decide for itself whether Article 16 has become applic-able. Consequently a resolution by the Council is not essential in order that Article 16 should be applied. If a Member of the League is satisfied that the Article has become applicable, it is entitled to act accordingly, even though the Council has given no opinion on the point.* But the result of the discussions before the Council would naturally have a considerable effect upon the opinions of Members of the League, and in the case now before the Committee, it seems unlikely that any action would be taken under Article 16 except in consequence of a recommendation by the Council. For this purpose unanimity on the Council, apart from the vote of the State concerned, would, as indicated above, probably suffice in practice; while the difficulty might, of course, have been solved by the previous withdrawal from the Council of the State concerned, or (if it were not a member of the Council), by its refusing to accept an invitation to sit under Article 4 (5).Should Article 16 have become applicable, the obligation on the Members of the League is to take the economic and financial measures mentioned in para-graph 1. There is no obligation to resort to war-like measures. According to resolution No. 3, the act of the defaulting State does not automatically create a state of war between itself and the other Members of the League, but it entitles those Members to &quot; resort to acts of war or to declare themselves in a state of war &apos;&apos; with it. It is moreover contemplated that in the first instance at any rate an attempt should be made to restore peace by economic pressure. It was also contemplated that the application of such pressure might be gradual, and might in the case of certain Members of the League be postponed wholly or partially. Moreover, the application of such pressure may be hampered by the necessity of respecting the rights of States who are not Members of the League.* This point would be particularly important if the Council had been prevented from giving an opinion by the vote of the delinquent State.
The action in this respect of the Members of the League may be described as being in the nature of a prohibition of &quot; trading with the enemy &quot;; the Members of the League would take the necessary steps to prevent persons subject to their jurisdiction from financial or commercial intercourse with the defaulting State. These steps would be taken by means of their own domestic legislation^ The question of what effect could be given in existing circumstances to the undertaking to prevent intercourse &quot; between the nationals of the covenant-breaking State and the nationals of any other State, whether a Member of the League or not &quot;is obscure; but it is not likely to be interpreted as involving any obligation to take measures, such as the imposition of a blockade, which could not be taken within the jurisdiction of the Members of the League. The original idea of the Article was, no doubt, that the League would, in time, become universal and consequently measures taken by the Members within their own jurisdiction would be effective to produce the desired result, though the possibility of more forcible measures becoming necessary was not excluded.But in existing circumstances the situation of States which are not Members of the League and have no obligations under Article 16 has to be taken into serious account. In so far as such States were prepared to co-operate in the measures taken by the League, their position would be, in practice, the same as that of the Members. But in the case of States who refused to co-operate, the mere application of the economic and financial measures contemplated would not enable the Members of the League to prevent trade, &amp;c, between those States and the covenant-breaking State, except in so far as action could effectively be taken within the jurisdiction of Members of the League.The measures so far contemplated could be taken without the Members of the League making use of their right to declare themselves in a state of war with the delinquent State, though as was once pointed out in a report by the Secretary-General, that State might make those measures the occasion of a recourse to war against the States which applied them.Article 16, however, also contemplates the possibility of war-like action being taken against the delinquent State. Under paragraph 2, the Council can recommend to the Governments concerned what forces they should &quot; contribute to the armed forces to be used to protect the covenants of the League.&quot; Moreover any Member of the League may, even if no such recommendation has been made by the Council, make use of its right to go to war with a covenant-breaking State.In this connection it should be pointed out that the 1921 resolutions contemplated the advisability of blockading the sea-board of the Covenant-breaking State and entrusting the execution of the blockade to certain Members of the League. It is possible that what was contemplated was the imposition of a blockade in consequence of a decision of the Council and without the States who conducted it necessarily declaring themselves to be in a state of war with the delinquent State. This situation might be possible as regards the application of the blockade measures to the ships of the Members of the League (or at any rate those who agreed that Article 16 was applicable), since in the circumstances the Members of the League could not object to the blockade being enforced against their own shipping, even though the blockading State did not formally possess belligerent rights. But as regards ships of non-members of the League (failing acquiescence on their part in the measures executed by the League), it does not appear that a blockade could be enforced unless the blockading Powers were at war with the delinquent State, and therefore possessed belligerent rights.&quot;!&quot; The same observation would apply to other measures at sea, such as the interception of vessels carrying goods regarded as contraband. If the measures contemplated went beyond the mere turning back of vessels proceeding to or from the blockaded area or carrying contraband, &amp;c, and it were proposed that such* In this connection the question arises whether an Act of Parliament would be required to confer the necessary powers upon His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Law Officers advised in 1920 that any prohibition of trade and financial relations and intercourse which may be necessary to give effect to Article 16 could be imposed by Order in Council under the Treaty of Peace Act, 1919; but the question whether at the present date this course of action, even though legally possible, would be a satisfactory method of dealing with the situation may well require consideration.f The question whether a so-called &quot;pacific blockade &quot; can be enforced against ships other than those of the blockaded State is extremely doubtful.
vessels should be captured and treated as prize, it would seem that it would be necessary for the country conducting these operations to declare itself to be in a state of war, since otherwise it would not seem possible to set up prize courts and to institute the necessary proceedings therein against the ships concerned. Moreover, the actual operations of blockade might well lead to hostilities with the navy of the blockaded country, and thus produce a state of war.As regards action against the shipping of the delinquent State itself, if it were possible to enforce a blockade of its coasts against the shipping of other nations without the blockading Power possessing belligerent rights, it would seem equally possible to enforce the blockade against the shipping of the delinquent State itself without those rights being necessary, For the reasons given in the preceding paragraph, however, this situation appears to be unlikely. Apart from this, operations at sea against enemy shipping are essentially a form of military action, and, although the delinquent State would hardly be in a position to claim that such action was illegitimate because the States concerned did not possess belligerent rights, it is difficult to see how in practice such operations could be carried on without the States concerned declaring themselves to be in a state of war against the Covenant-breaking country. Moreover, in the case of a country which possesses a navy, operations of this nature seem almost bound in practice to lead to actual hostilities.The conclusions which seem to result from the above considerations are as follows : (1) The economic and financial measures contemplated in the first paragraph of Article 16 do not involve the use of belligerent rights; they could (subject to any question as to the rights of non-members of the League) be applied by steps taken within our own jurisdiction, and would not necessarily involve our declaring ourselves to be in a state of war.&apos;(2) If it became necessary to take action at sea to prevent commercial intercourse between the delinquent State and non-members of the League who declined to co-operate or acquiesce in the economic and financial measures taken, this could not be done without the possession of belligerent rights, which would involve our declaring ourselves to be in a state of war with the delinquent State.(3) Action against shipping of the delinquent State, though perhaps theoretically possible without our declaring ourselves to be at war, would, if the State concerned possessed a navy, almost inevitably lead to hostilities at sea and thus involve us in a state of war.APPENDIX VI.Statement of What is Legally Possible in regard to the Closing of the Suez Canalto Shipping.&apos; THE main consideration would seem to be one of preventing Italy&apos;s use of the Canal for the purpose of her communications with her Forces engaged in hostilities with Abyssinia, and the prevention of the Canal being used for the purpose of ordinary Italian commerce, if contemplated at all, is of less importance; but on either hypothesis it does not seem possible to confine the consideration of the matter to the position of Italian shipping alone, since non-Italian ships might be used as transports, for carrying munitions, &amp;c.The provisions of the Suez Canal Convention of 1888 which are relevant in this connection are as follows : -&quot; Article I.The Suez Maritime Canal shall always be free and open, in time of war as in time of peace, to every vessel of commerce or of war, without distinction of flag.Consequently, the High Contracting Parties agree not in any way to interfere with the free use of the Canal, in time of war as in time of peace.The Canal shall never be subjected to the exercise of the right, of blockade.&quot;
&quot;Article IV.The Maritime Canal remaining open in time of war as a free passage, even to the ships of war of belligerents, according to the terms of Article I of the present Treaty, the High Contracting Parties agree that no right of war, no act of hostility, nor any act having for its object to obstruct the free navigation of the Canal, shall be committed in the Canal, and its ports of access, as well as within a radius of three marine miles from these ports, even though the Ottoman Empire should be one of the belligerent Powers.Vessels of war of belligerents shall not revictual or take in stores in the Canal and its ports of access, except in so far as may be strictly necessary. The transit of the aforesaid vessels through the Canal shall be effected with the least delay, in accordance with the Regulations in force, and without any other intermission than that resulting from the necessities of the service.Their stay at Port Said and in the roadstead of Suez shall not exceed twenty-four hours, except in case of distress. In such case they shall be bound to leave as soon as possible. An interval of twenty-four hours shall always elapse between the sailing of a belligerent ship from one of the ports of access and the departure of a ship belonging to the hostile Power.&quot;&quot; Article V.In time of war belligerent Powers shall not disembark nor embark within the Canal and its ports of access either troops, munitions or materials of war. But in case of an accidental hindrance in the Canal, men may be embarked or disembarked at the ports of access by detachments not exceeding 1,000 men, with a corresponding amount of war material.&quot;&quot; Article VI.Prizes shall be subjected, in all respects, to the same rules as the vessels of war of belligerents.&quot;&quot;Article IX.The Egyptian Government shall, within the limits of its powers resulting from the Firmans, and under the conditions provided for in the present Treaty, take the necessary measures for insuring the execution of the said Treaty.In case the Egyptian Government should not have sufficient means at its disposal, it shall call upon the Imperial Ottoman Government, which shall take the necessary measures to respond to such appeal; shall give notice thereof to the Signatory Powers of the Declaration of London of the 17th March, 1885; and shall, if necessary, concert with them on the subject.The provisions of Articles IV, V, VII and VIII shall not interfere with the measures which shall be taken in virtue of the present article.&quot;&quot; Article XLThe measures which shall be taken in cases provided for by Articles IX and X of the present Treaty shall not interfere with the free use of the Canal. In the same cases, the erection of permanent fortifications contrary to the provisions of Article VIII is prohibited.&quot;It may be assumed for present purposes (though the position is not absolutely clear) that for the purposes of Article IX, His Majesty&apos;s Government have now &quot;succeeded to the position of the Turkish Government, and that consequently it would fall to them to take the necessary steps to ensure the execution of the Treaty in the event of the Egyptian Government not having sufficient means at their -disposal to do so.The parties to the Convention are the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia* and Turkey.It will be seen that under the Convention Italy, like all the other signatories, has a treaty right to the use of the Canal in time of war as in time of peace, both for her warships and for her merchant shipping; the parties have agreed &quot; not* The position of the Soviet Union in this respect is not altogether clear, but the point is immaterial for present purposes.
in any way to interfere with the free use of the Canal in time of war as in time of peace,&quot; and the Canal is never to be blockaded.This being so, what are the circumstances, if any, in which action by His Majesty&apos;s Government to prevent the Italians making use of the Canal in the event of a war with Abyssinia would be legally justified ?The opinion is expressed that such action would be legally justified if Italy had resorted to war against Abyssinia in violation of Articles 12, 13 or 15 of the Covenant, if the League accordingly took action against Italy under Article 16, and if the Council decided that Italy was to be denied the use of the Suez Canal, and requested His Majesty&apos;s Government to take the necessary steps to secure this result.* In other words, the action taken would be League action, and His Majesty&apos;s Government would be acting on behalf of the League at the request of the Council. These circumstances should suffice to overrule the provisions of the Convention; in such the Covenant-breaking State has put itself outside the law, and the provisions of the Convention should not prevent action which the League may think fit to take against it. Moreover, Article 20 of the Covenant, under which &quot; the Members of the League severally agree that this Covenant is accepted as abrogating all obligations or understandings inter se which are inconsistent with the terms thereof,&quot; could perhaps be regarded as applicable.It does not seem necessary to consider the question whether the action contemplated would be possible where His Majesty&apos;s Government were acting against Italy under Article 16, but the Council made no recommendation about the closing of the Canal, since it seems inconceivable that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would be prepared to act in this way except in pursuance of a decision by the Council.On this basis it would be legally possible to deny the use of the Canal to Italian shipping, whether warships, fleet auxiliaries, transports, vessels carrying supplies for Italian military forces, or merchant shipping engaged in ordinary commercial operations.What would be the position of vessels of other States ? In the circumstances postulated, the Members of the League, or at any rate those Members who agreed that Article 16 had become applicable against Italy, could not object to the use of the Canal being denied to any of their vessels which were engaged either in assisting the operations of Italian forces (as by carrying troops, supplies, &amp;c), or in commercial operations with Italy which were prohibited under Article 16. The mere fact of those vessels being so engaged would be inconsistent with the obligations of the flag State, as a Member of the League, under Article 16.The position of the ships of non-members of the League would be different, since the latter have no obligations under Article 16, and unless they were co-operating or acquiescing in the measures taken by the League against Italy, such rights as they may possess to the free use of the Canal would be unaffected. The position would be the same as regards any Members of the League who did not agree that Article 16 had become applicable, though their position, in face of the unanimous recommendation of the Council which had been postulated, would be somewhat delicate.Germany is the only party to the Convention who is not a Member of the League.t But the other States not Members of the League, of whom the most important are the United States and Japan, may well contend that the Conven-tion has now become part of general international law, and that all States, whether parties to it or not, are entitled to its benefits. If so, and failing acquiescence on their part, it does not seem possible to find any legal justification for denying the use of the Canal to their shipping which might be employed by the Italians in connexion with the supply of their forces, or engaged in trade with Italy. The position in this respect of Germany, as a party to the Convention, would obviously be stronger.Leaving this difficulty aside for the moment, the operation of denying the use of the Canal to Italy could perhaps in theory be carried out without His* From the point of view of emphasising the collective natui-e of the action taken, it might be desirable that one or two other Powers should be associated with His Majesty&apos;s Government in taking the necessary steps, but from our point of view there might well be objections to this being done.f She ceases to be one in October, but must for practical purposes be treated as having ceased to be one already.
Majesty&apos;s Government declaring themselves to be in a state of war with that -country, but the operation could hardly be carried out without the use of a certain amount of force, and if an Italian warship were to try and pass the Canal, or if Italian merchant ships attempting to do so were escorted by Italian warships, hostilities might well ensue. It would seem, therefore, that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment could hardly carry out the operations in question unless they were prepared to contemplate the possibility of their finding themselves engaged in war with Italy in consequence.If this situation did arise, it might afford a solution of the difficulty about the shipping of non-members of the League referred to above. For if they were in possession of belligerent rights, His Majesty&apos;s Government might well be able to prevent such shipping from using the Canal by means of measures taken outside the Canal itself, such as capturing the vessels in question in the Mediterranean approaches to the Canal or in the Red Sea on ground of the carriage of contraband, unneutral service, &amp;c. A blockade of the Italian ports in Africa might also be feasible. But in so far as such vessels were engaged in trade with Italy which did not. come under the head of carriage of contraband, it would only be possible to deal with them if some measure had been adopted, such as a blockade of the Italian coasts, which enabled this to be done, and in that event it would be better if the necessary action could be taken in some area distinct from that of the Suez Canal, since otherwise the State concerned might be able to rely on the last paragraph of Article 1 of the Convention, under which the Canal is never to be blockaded.Under Article IV of the Convention &apos;&apos; no right of war, nor act of hostility, nor any act having for its object to obstruct the free navigation of the Canal shall be committed in the Canal and its ports of access, as well as within a radius of 3 marine miles from those ports.&quot; In the case of Italy, or of ships of Members of the League who agreed that Article 16 was applicable, this provision should not prevent the necessary steps being taken within the area defined; but it would seem that any action which His Majesty&apos;s Government might take in the exercise of belligerent rights to prevent the vessels of other States from using the Canal would have to be taken outside the 3-mile radius.
