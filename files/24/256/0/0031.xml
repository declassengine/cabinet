jj C R E T. Copy No. 2^. Q. . .C A B I N E T..p. 171  (35) .NATIONALITY OE MARRIED WOMEN. Memorandum by the Home Secretary.At its meeting on the 5th June, 1935,  the Cabinet considered the question of the nationality of married women, which had been under discussion by a Committee set up during the meetings of British Commonwealth Prime Ministers, when it was suggested that a document be drawn up setting out the difficulties which would result both from the adoption of the principle of equality, and from the adoption (in the absence of uniformity) by one or more members of the Commonwealth of any further measures in the direction of equality.      The Cabinet agreed -(a)      that the Home Secretary,  in consultation with the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,  should draw up a Memorandum setting forth the attitude of the United Kingdom Government towards the question of the Nationality of Married Women:(fb)      that the Memorandum should be submitted to theCabinet before being circulated to the representatives of the Dominions on the Committee.The attached memorandum explaining the position has been drawn up in accordance with these instructions, and permission is now sought to circulate it to the representatives of the Dominions.Reference is made in the memorandum to the &quot;common status&quot; - an expression which was first used in the Report of 1929 on the Operation of Dominion Legislation.     In paragraph 75 of
that Repbrt it is stated that &quot;the members of the Commonwealth are united by a common allegiance to the Crown and that allegiance is the basis of the common status possesaed by all subjects of His Majesty&quot;1;    and in paragraph 76 it is stated that &quot;a common status directly recognised throughout the British Commonwealth in recent years has been given a statutory basis through the operation of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act,  1914&quot;.      Under the existing law,   therefore,   the expression &quot;common status&quot; means simply the status possessed by all persons who are British subjects recognised as such throughout the British Commonwealth.Each member of the Commonwealth is,  of course,  free to make laws deciding who are its nationals or citizens,  and laws were passed in Canada in 1921 and in South Africa in 1927 defining the &quot;nationals&quot; of those Dominions .      But under the existing position the &quot;common status&quot; is not directly linked up with or dependent upon the possession of Dominion &quot;nationality&quot;; on the contrary,  it is broadly speaking true to say that a person must be a British subject in order to qualify for the &quot;nationality&quot; of the two Dominions who have legislated as above stated.      The question whether a person has acquired and still retains the common status depends on whether or not he or she is a British subject under the British Nationality and Status pf Aliens Act, 1914, or the corresponding and substantially identical legislation in the Dominion concerned.     The acquisition of British nationality at birth,  in the case of persons born on British soil before 1915, depends on the common law, or,   in the case of persons born abroad before that year,  upon the British Nationality Acts of 1730 and 1772.whether any change is to be made hereafter in the legal basis of the common status, and if so what change, is a matter to be determined by agreement between the members of the Commonwealth. Until any change is brought about by such an agreement and by legislation giving effect to it,  the common status will continue to have the meaning described above.      It is necessary to point out,
however,  that the Union of South Africa have contended that the expression &quot;British subject&quot; is inappropriate to the conception of a common status recognised throughout the Commonwealth;    and it is with this contention in mind that the term &quot;subject of His Majesty&quot;  (in place of the term &quot;British subject&quot;) was adopted in the O.D.L. Report of 1929 and in subsequent correspondence and discuss ions.This memorandum does not attempt to deal fully with the position in relation to the Irish Free State, where special considerations arise.J .S .29th August,  1935
At the meeting with Dominirn Ministers which took place on the 30th Hay,  1935,  to consider the question of the nationality of married women,  it was agreed to record the conclusion that in present circumstances it was impossible to obtain unanimity for any advance to be made in the direction of equality as between the sexes beyond the agreement embodied in the Hague Convention.      The Australian Prime Minister asked that a document should be drawn up setting out the difficulties which would result both (1)  from the adoption rf the principle of equality,  and (2) from the adoption by one or more members of the Commonwealth of any further measures in the direction of equality in the absence of unanimity.1.    The attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom has always been that unanimity between the different members of the British Commonwealth is a matter of the highest importance,  and in their view the obstacle to further measures in the direction of equality between men and women is the impossibility of obtaining unanimity on such measures.      They have no wish tc argue the case of those who think the disadvantages of such measures outweigh the advantages:    but in response to the request made at the recent meeting they may say that the reasons which make it impossible to secure general consent throughout the Commonwealth to such further measures are the same as the reasons which have influenced many foreign states to maintain in general the principle that the wife&apos;s nationality should follow that of her husband.      These reasons appear to be as follows?(a)    It is felt that the possession of different nationalities by husband and wife would impair the unity of the family.      This view is strongly held on traditional and religious grounds,  and it is suggested that it is not necessary and is indeed detrimental to the community to/add
add to other possible causes of differences in the family a divergence of interests&apos;which might result from the. fact that&quot;&apos; the husband and wife owe allegiance to different States. It is further urged that If a woman has a different nationality from that of her husband the problem of the nationality of the children presents difficulties even to those in favour of the general principle of equality.(b)    Prom the international point of view,  the objection is taken that if husband and wife possess a different nationality serious inconvenience may result on account of their owing duties to and being entitled to look for protection to different. States.      In the case of strained relations between the States in question this difficulty would become acute.      Incidentally the objectors observe that conferring the right on the wife to retain her original nationality may not in fact secure to her -those advantages which she expects,  since until  the desired change is accepted by the majority of countries the normal procedure will still be that her husband country will regard her as having his nationality.      In other words,  the right will be largely illusory unless the woman is residing in her country of origin.      It is the settled oractice of Governments in reference to one of their nationals not to extend protection to a person who possesses another nationality while in the State where that person possesses the other nationality.      As the laws of most countries stand at present the acceptance of the principle of equality would undoubtedly lead to a considerable  increase in cases of dual nationality,  which are always liable to cause trouble and inconvenience wherever the parties reside.       If the husband and the wife take up their residence in a third State the representative of both the States of which she is a national would be entitled to extend protection to the wife.      Such a position is always likely to prove embarrassing to the authorities
concerned.      Moreover,  it would be difficult te find a  . solution for complications which might, arise in cases where the status and rights of the husband and wife respectively in the third country are dependent on two entirely different sets of laws and treaty provisions.(c)    In the field of private international law the difficulties which might arise in the event of effect being given to the equality principles are of a purely legal character, but they are,  so the critics contend, nevertheless appreciable.      It is sufficient to state here that the difficulty is one which will affect the courts rather than the administrative authorities and,   in particular,  the courts of those countries whose law requires that questions of status and capacity shall be settled by the law *f the country whose nationality the person,   concerned possesses.      It is probable that any difficulties with which the court may be confronted in this class of case would be likely to affect adversely the women concerned.The issues raised by proposals for equality between the sexes in matters of nationality are of a far reaching character, and in a brief summary it is impossible to do justice to this large subject.      The object of the foregoing paragraphs is not tc make a comprehensive review of the question, nor to advance objections to  the policy of equality;    the object is simply to indicate the nature of the. nbjections whidh are felt in various quarters.2.    The question whether it would be possible to get over these objections and to secure unanimity throughout the Commonwealth on proposals for so amending the law as to give to women a position more closely approximating to that of men was considered in connection with legislation to give effect to the Hague Convention of 1930.      The record of the Imperial Conference of 1930 contains
Nationality of Married Women. -Careful consideration was given to the subject of the nationality of married women.      All the Members of the Commonwealth represented at the Hague Conference of 1930 signed the Nationality Convention there concluded,  and will, it is assumed,  introduce such legislation as may be. necessary to give effect to Articles 8-10 of that Convention .      The Conference was satisfied, however,  that any proposals for the further modification of the principle of the existing law would fail to secure unanimous agreement.      It follows that the Conference was unable to make any recommendation for the substantive amendment of the law on this subject except to the extent stated above.Effect has been given in the United Kingdom to this recommendation by the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1933;    and in Canada and New Zealand by similar enactments in 1932 and 1935 respectively.      Subject to this,  the position today is the same as it was  in 1930.Accordingly the adoption by one or more members of the Commonwealth of any further measures in the direction of equality would mean that there would be in different parts of the Commonwealth different provisions as tO( the circumstances in which women become or cease to be British subjects,   and a consequent breach of the principle of unanimity to which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom attach the highest importance.      Divergencies of law in different parts of the Commonwealth on the subject of theArticle 8.     If the national law of the wife causes her to lose her nationality on marriage with a foreigner,   this consequence shall be conditional  on her acquiring the nationality of her husband.Article 9.    If the national lew of the wife causes her to lose her nationality upon a change in the nationality of her husband occurring during marriage,   this consequence shall be conditional on her acquiring her husband&apos;s new nationality.Article 10.  Naturalisation of the husband during marriage shall not involve a change in the nationality of the wife except with her consent.the following paragraph (Summary of Proceedings, p.22);
nationality of married women could not be regarded as minor provisions designed to meet particular local conditions.      The very fact that the question has aroused so much controversy and given rise to differences of opinion which it has not been possible in spite of prolonged efforts to reconcile,  shows that this matter cannot be regarded as a minor issue but must be treated as a matter of principle;    and in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom the existence in different parts of the British Commonwealth of divergent laws regarding the qualifications of women for the status of British subject would inevitably lead to  serious difficulty in maintaining the conception that this is a status common to all subjects of His Majesty throughout the Commonwealth.It was agreed at the Imperial Conference of 1930 that while it rested with each member of the British Commonwealth to define its own nationals no member would take any action affecting the &quot;common status&quot; possessed by all  subjects of His Majesty except by agreement with the &quot;other members.      This agreement clearly does not debar any member of the Commonwealth who desires to do so from conferring local rights within its territory on British born women who have ceased to be British subjects by marriage with an alien.      The question of the law relating to the status of British subject is quite distinct from that of the law relating to the enjoyment of local rights,  and a law conferring local rights on women who do not possess the status of British subject is not a matter for consultation between members of the Common-wealth.In the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom any action is to be deplored which might lead to the abandonment of the  conception that in addition to  the links
ti C which bind each citizen to his own country and Government there  is an embracing concept to which legal effect is given by providing a common status for every subject of His Majesty in every part of the Commonwealth.
e) U 0SUPPLEjLIENTARY NOTE FOR CIRCULATION TO ALL DOMINIONS EXCEPT THE IRISH FREE -STAKE .It appears from correspondence in connection with the recent Irish Free State Nationality Act that the Irish Free State Government take a different view of the meaning of &quot;common status&apos;1 from that held at any rate in the United Kingdom.      That Act contains a provision which repeals,  if and in so far as they were in force in or formed part of the law of the Irish Free State,  the law relating to the status of British subjects,  i.e. the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act,  1914,  and the common law.It is the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom that the common status at present rests on the basis of. the qualifications laid down in the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act of the United Kingdom,  and the corresponding Dominion legislation.      On this view it is clear, particularly having regard to the &quot;repealing provision in the Irish Free State Act referred to above, that the Irish Free State Act,  in so far as it confers Irish Free State citizenship on persons not at present qualified for the common status, has no bearing on the question of common status. It is not,  therefore,  necessary to take&apos; into account, for the purposes of this memorandum,  the provisions in that legislation relating to the position of married women which go beyond the provisions of the Hague Convention.      All the other members of the Commonwealth have signified their adherence to the Hague Convention, though the Union of South Africa has not yet taken steps to give effect to it,  and the Bill introduced into the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia for the purpose of giving effect to the Hague Convention has not yet been passed.      It is clear,  therefore, that there has been no breach of uniformity in principle;    and it is also clear as a result of the recent discussions that uniformity oannot be obtained on any basis other than that of the Hague Convention .
