The subject has now been taken up by the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on Defence Policy and Requirements, who have arrived at certain provisional decisions that are submitted to the Cabinet for approval.2. Until a year ago the scheme for the Air Defence of Great Britain had been designed to meet the possibility of attack from France only, and did not cover the Midlands or .any part of northern England. The change in the inter-national situation which led to the Inquiries into Defence requirements and to the first expansion of the Royal Air Force a year ago necessitated the re-examination of the air defence scheme. This was conducted, in the first instance, by the Home Defence Committee, who appointed a special Committee, under the Chairmanship of Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, to prepare a scheme. The original scheme has since been considered by the Home Defence Committee, the Chiefs of Staff Committee and the Air Defence Research Committee. The Reports of all these bodies are attached (D.P.R.-2 and D.P.R.-3).3. The Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements are not yet in a position to make recommendations as to the rate at which the stages of the scheme should be completed. They have, however, reached the following ad interim conclusions, for which they ask the Cabinet&apos;s approval: (I) To approve in principle that the final scheme, as laid, down in para-graphs 35 and 36 on page 11 of the Report by a Sub-Committee on the Re-orientation of the Air Defence System of Great Britain and as illustrated in Map No. 3 attached to that Report, is the scheme to be aimed at.(II) Subject to the further consideration which is now being given to the rate at which the stages of the whole Scheme should be completed, to approve the completion by 1940 of that part of Stage 1 of the defences described in the following parts of paragraph 49 on page 13 of the Report on the Re-orientation of the Air Defence System of Great Britain: (a) The partial provision of A.A. defences in the Inner Artillery Zone covering Greater London and consisting of 8 A.A. batteries and 6 searchlight companies;(6) the provision of 9 of the A.A. batteries for the Outer Artillery Zone, of which 5 are to be located in the Thames and Medway[11882]
(c) the&apos; provision. of searchlights in the Aircraft Fighting Zone and Outer Artillery Zone from Portsmouth to Huntingdon, except that the depth of the portion of the Aircraft Fighting Zone from Portsmouth to Godalming should be limited temporarily to 15 miles.  This will require 36 searchlight companies.(III) To reserve for further discussion and consideration that part of the proposals for Stage 1 (contained in sub-paragraph (d) of paragraph 49) which relates to the raising and training of additional A.A. defence units for the second and third stages.(IV) To take note of the fact that the proposal (contained in sub-para-graph (e) of paragraph 49) for the expansion of the Observer Corps Organisation had already been approved by the Committee of Imperial Defence at their meeting held on the 16th April, 1935,* when they had under consideration a Report on the Organisation and Expansion of the Observer Corps (C.I.D. Paper No. 206-A). (V) To take note of the contents and conclusions of the Interim Report of the Sub-Committee on Air Defence Research (Paper No. D.P.R.-3).(Initialled) J. R. M.

We have studied this Report and the covering remarks of the Home Defence Committee as far as the time at our disposal has permitted, and have been impressed with the care and detail with which the Report has been drawn up. Its recommendations are clearly based on our defence necessities, and the measures proposed are those which would best fit the dangers to be apprehended. We are in agreement with the arguments which have led the Sub-Committee on the Re-orientation of the Air Defence System of Great Britain to their conclusions with regard to the best scheme of anti-aircraft defence, and we accept, in principle, the general findings of that Sub-Committee so far as the purely technical requirements of Home defence are concerned and subject to our remarks later in this Report on their wider implications.3. We realise that if, as seems inevitable, this country is liable to heavy air attack, an adequate defence scheme must be constructed, and that the absence of such a scheme would seriously imperil the security of this country. In examining the proposals we asked ourselves (i) whether the final defence scheme suggested would prove effective andworth the cost of its provision, and (ii) if so, what rate of progress should be aimed at.Effectiveness of the Defence Scheme proposed.4. At the outset we must emphasise that to date no scheme of air defence has been found, however carefully prepared, which can provide complete security, and we can only draw from the experiences of the past and endorse the opinions expressed in the Report that, with our present knowledge and under existing conditions, the continuous system of defence seems the best that can be devised. At night this system, in which guns and searchlights along a continuous belt co-operate with the defending aircraft, is at its best in clear weather, and its* C.I.B./269th Meeting, Minute 6.[11559]
effectiveness will be largely mitigated when clouds and bad visibility, which occur on an average of 50 per cent, of the days in the year, are present. The enemy under the latter circumstances has the opportunity of approaching his objectives above the clouds and screened from searchlight detection. Interception by the defending aircraft then becomes largely a matter of chance, though this must be weighed against the fact that there will be added difficulties on the part of the enemy aircraft in reaching and locating their targets. In this connection we are aware of the Report* of the Air Attache&quot; in Berlin, in which he was impressed by the effectiveness of the &apos;&apos; blacking out&apos;&apos; organisation, and we recommend that this aspect of air defence, as against darkening arrangements only, should be carefully investigated by the Air Raids Precautions Organisation.5. Though the effectiveness of a defence system of guns and searchlights is largely reduced by the presence of cloud, its necessity on clear nights still stands. The general knowledge of the existence of a defence lay-out will greatly enhance the morale of the civil population, and will have an equal, but contrary, moral effect upon the attackers. The depth of the lighted zone (26 miles) is the minimum at present necessary for the interception of the enemy aircraft, and if developments in the future still further reduce the relation between the speeds of bomber and fighter aircraft it may be essential to increase this depth, entailing further heavy commitments in searchlights and personnel. It must, however, be borne in mind that even if the interception of the enemy aircraft on their inward journey is only partially effective they have yet to face similar attacks on their return.   The moral effect of this should not be under-estimated.6. As pointed out in the Report and the covering memorandum, the total war strength of units required to implement the scheme is 43,500 men. To obtain these men the War Office are prepared to convert the equivalent of two Territorial Divisions out of fourteen, giving thus some 18,000 men, who were formerly available for the later contingents of the Field Force. Beyond this they cannot hope to go in the way of conversion, without denuding the later contingents. It is true that in normal times units up to approximately 75 per cent, of war establishment could be accepted, the remaining 25 per cent, being unskilled personnel who could be enlisted on the outbreak of war. Nevertheless, under the present conditions it is by no means certain that the Territorial Army could find by ordinary recruitment the men required to complete the defensive system. The actual strength of existing Anti-Aircraft units is only 41 per cent, of their peace establishments. This leads to the conclusion that the Government will probably have to undertake a national campaign to secure the necessary additional recruits for the Territorial Army and, if this fails, to make provision for obtaining the men by some other means.Rate of Progress.7. The covering memorandum to the Report recommended the adoption of a rate of progress which would complete the first three stages of the defence scheme by 1942 (known as Scheme A). This recommendation was made purely from the point of view of Home defence, and attention was drawn to the broader considerations, including those of Imperial defence in general and of finance which must be taken into account. An alternative in the form of Scheme B was also discussed, where the defence would be completed by 1946. The importance of the part which the Anti-Aircraft defences will play in their co-operation with the defending aircraft is quite apparent, and we can only come to the conclusion that these Anti-Aircraft defences should be provided pari passu with the provision of the defending aircraft. With this Scheme A, generally speaking, complies, and the rate of provision contained in this Scheme, therefore, appears to us to be the only one which, from the air defence point of view, can be considered satisfactory.8. Certain disadvantages in accepting such a high rate of progression have, however, been put before us by the War Office. Developments in anti-aircraft methods resulting from the work of the Scientific Committee must be anticipated and would probably take place at such a date as to make modifications in the* Paper No. A.R.P. (O) 495..
-defence scheme difficult. Again, important new developments in equipment are already in sight, but it would be impossible to bring these to the production stage until the latter part of a five-year programme, especially as productive capacity will, in this case, be strained to the utmost. There is therefore the choice between Scheme B, which, while providing only a measure of defence for the Midlands by the time the aircraft provision is completed, will in the end produce a more efficient defence, and Scheme A, which, while , having the advantage of earlier completion, will not have that of such up-to-date equipment. Finally, if Scheme A is adopted, special measures of an emergency character to enable the mass of equipment required to be produced in so short a time will be necessary.9. Nevertheless, we consider that if, on grounds of foreign policy, the fullest security must be provided as early as 1942, the anti-aircraft defence must accord closely with the proposed Royal Air Force expansion, and we are prepared to accept the fact that the rate of progress might be such that it would be unable ;to be provided with the latest type or equipment or to take full advantage of new developments. The rate of provision must primarily be governed by the date by which the full defence appears necessary, and the best efforts must be made during the process to incorporate any new developments evolved.10. It is pointed out that the guns and searchlights required will not be in the form of fixed defences. They will have mobility, though limited, and re-adjustment of the lay-out will always be possible, though at some cost, when undertaking communication re-arrangements. As regards the special measures of an emergency character, if Scheme A is adopted, we recommend that the necessary powers should be provided as soon as possible.Financial Implications.11. The foregoing has been put forward purely from an air defence point of view, and we are alarmed at the financial implications. The total cost, both capital and for maintenance, of Scheme A will amount to about  11,700,000 by the 31st March, 1942. This is one more financial commitment in which the Government may become involved. We have just had under consideration a further enlargement of our air strength to meet the German increases involving the expenditure of about  17-! millions.* Even that expansion of the Royal Air Force made no provision for war reserves. These additions are being put forward at a time when we are informed that there is not sufficient money to make up the existing Service deficiencies brought about by the ten-year rule. These deficiencies have been represented on numerous occasions, and in 1931 a full statement of those relating to anti-aircraft defence was submitted for the information of the Three-Party Committee in D.C. (P) 15 (paragraph 45 and Appendix I). It has now become necessary therefore to undertake in a period of some five years expenditure that would normally, except for the ten-year rule, have been spread over some fifteen years. Whether this can be done within the provisions of annual estimates is a matter that clearly requires early -consideration.12. The provision of an anti-aircraft defence system for Great Britain can-not be taken as providing a substitute for any other part of our general defence requirements, and it becomes, though necessary, an additional burden. The War Office, under the proposals of the Defence Requirements Committee of last year, were only allotted half their requirements to make good deficiencies in the next five years. To this we have already drawn attention in our previous Report.* The principal result of this partial allotment is that the Field Force will, at the present rate, not be fully equipped for at least nine years. The action of the Field Force in contesting the occupation by Germany of the Low Countries is of such importance, both as an aid to our own offensive air operations and as a check upon the action of the enemy against objectives in this country, both by air and ,sea, that the needs of that Force should be provided concurrently with the air defence measures now under consideration.* Paper No. CCS. 374.
13. Again, though this has not such a direct bearing on the air defence-question, we must anticipate the possibility of additional financial burdens in connection with the Navy. Under the Defence Requirements proposals naval expenditure was left undecided. To-day we are on the threshold of a possible, if not probable, breakdown in naval agreements, and this, in conjunction with German reconstruction, may force us to reconsider the measures necessary for naval security.Conclusion.14. The anti-aircraft defence scheme put forward in the Report we have had under examination is, in our view, the proper one to be aimed at, and its provision should be completed by the time at which Germany could be ready to&apos; wage a successful war. Its completion alone, however, does not provide satisfactory general defence, and the parallel other requirements of the Defence Services are of equal importance. It appears to be a matter for Government decision as to what date we should aim at for the completion of our preparations. The comments by the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (contained in Paper No. D.C. (M) (32) 139) suggest that this date may be much in advance of 1942. This does not accord with our views expressed to date, and we are proposing to consider the matter separately. Should this, in fact, be the case, adequate security can only be provided by still further accelerating the rate^ of provision of the Anti-Aircraft defence of this country in conjunction with the equally important acceleration of our other defence measures, and by taking action to ensure that existing deficiencies in all three Defence Services have been made good by the same date.(Signed) ERNLE CHATFIELD.A.

MEMORANDUM BY THE HOME DEFENCE SUB-COMMITTEE OF THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.THE re-orientation of the air defence system of Great Britain was referred to the Home Defence Committee by the Air Staff on the 30th July, 1934. On the 2nd August, the Committee invited a Sub-Committee, under the Chairmanship of Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Air Defence of Great Britain, to consider the question in the light of Germany&apos;s rearmament in the air and the consequent changes in the situation. As Ministers were informed at the time of the Defence Requirements Enquiry of 1934, the then existing scheme for air defence had been designed to meet the possibility of attack from France and did not cover the Midlands or any part of northern England, and it was not possible to make any recommendations on the question of its extension until it had been examined in all its aspects. This extension of the scheme is dealt with in the Sub-committee Report, which is attached.Rate of Provision.2. In the Sub-Committee&apos;s terms of reference it is laid down that it will be necessary for the organisation to proceed by stages, and that the first stage is to be governed by existing financial provision. The Sub-Committee have accordingly, made recommendations for the completion of the Air Defence of Great Britain in three stages, which are summarised in Part IV of the Report and illustrated in the accompanying three maps.3. The first stage, which is to be completed by 1940, provides a partial defence for South-east England only. The second stage provides a considerable proportion of the anti-aircraft guns required for the complete scheme and a measure of searchlight equipment throughout the length of the defences (from Portsmouth to the Tees) for .the essential co-operation with defending fighter aircraft in night defence. If expenditure continued to be incurred at the rate contemplated under the Ministerial Defence Requirements Committee&apos;s Report, the second stage would not be completed before about 1945. The third stage completes the full depth of the lighted zone throughout and, in addition, provides local anti-aircraft defences for some of the Midland industrial districts. At the rate of expenditure as authorised for 1935-39 it would not be completed until about 1950, and the Sub-Committee, in their Report, express the opinion that the Air Defence of Great Britain cannot be considered as providing an adequate security until this third stage is completed. With this the Home Defence Committee are in agreement, and draw attention to the fact that, even after the completion of the third stage, there would remain some supplementary defences to complete local requirements.4. It will be seen that the Sub-Committee&apos;s scheme complies with their terms of reference. The Home Defence Committee, however, desire to draw the attention of the Committee of Imperial Defence to the fact that the situation has developed considerably since last August, when these terms of reference were drawn up. The provision of first-line aircraft for the defence of Great Britain is now to be completed by the 31st March, 1939, and His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided to accelerate the programme for the expansion of the Royal Air Force in the early part of the period 1935-39. It should also be borne in mind that the Ministerial Defence Requirements Committee contemplated the completion of the reserves of aircraft in the three following years, i.e., by the&apos; 31st March, 1942, and that it is hoped the civilian, air raids precautions arrange-ments will be well advanced by that time. From the summary given in the preceding paragraph, it will, however, be seen that, under the Sub-Committee&apos;s proposals, by the 31st March, 1940, the anti-aircraft defence of Great Britain will only have reached its first stage, and that the whole of the great industrial areas of.the Midlands and.the North will remain completely unprotected so far as gun and searchlight defences are concerned, air defence resting entirely upon aircraft without the aid of searchlights, which are essential for night work. [11445] b 2
Cost of Scheme A.7. An endeavour has been made to collate the total cost arising in the next five years if this recommendation (Scheme A) is adopted. The figures are necessarily tentative, and should be treated as approximate. Capital cost of the provision of Stage 1 ... ...        2,250,000*(as discussed in the Report)Capital cost of the provision of Stage 2 ... ...        3,000,000(as1 discussed in the Report)Cost of certain additional personnel required for Stages 1 and 2 over and above that provided by the conversion of existing units      ... ... 100,000Approximate total maintenance charges involved during the period of expansion to the end of Stage 2   ... ... ... ... ...        1,600,000Total expenditure over 5 years if Stages 1 and 2 are by then completed ... ... ... ...        6,950,0001The expenditure of  6,950,000 proposed for Stages 1 and 2 would commence at  562,500 in the first year (1935-36), rising each succeeding year, and culminating in the last year in an expenditure of  2,370,000. The annual maintenance charges when Stages 1 and 2 have been completed would amount to  656,250.The capital sum required to complete Stage 3 is  2,500,000. If expenditure were to be maintained at about the level contemplated for the year 1939-40 for two further years, Stage 3 could be completed by the 31st March, 1942. The annual maintenance charges would by then have risen to approximately  1,000,000.8. In arriving at this estimate of cost, it has been assumed that the most satisfactory method of securing this rapid expansion of the air defence organisa-tion would be to provide a steadily rising scale of capital expenditure. But the Committee understand that even if the capital expenditure were to be spread in* Of this  1,750,000 was provisionally approved in the allotments under the Defence Requirements Committee&apos;s Report.f In addition to the Air Defence of Great Britain scheme, certain financial commitments are involved by the provision of proper A.A. defence for ports subject to enemy attack. The precise number of ports to be so defended and the amount of defence to be provided still requires investigation, but it is probable that the cost may amount in the next five years to about  500,000 (of which sum  160,000 was provisionally allotted under the D.R.C. report). (See paragraph 15 below.)5. The Home Defence Committee are fully aware how wide are the commit-ments of His Majesty&apos;s Government for Imperial Defence and Home Defence, and they realise that a decision as to the expenditure to be incurred on anti-aircraft defence can only be reached after weighing considerations that are beyond their scope. For example, there is the relative importance of different forms of defence, and, apart from the importance of providing an adequate force of aircraft, the Committee are not oblivious to the importance of the Field Force as a factor in security against air attack, since its primary task is, by action on the Continent, to secure defences or bases for our own use, to deny such bases to the enemy, and generally to provide depth to our air defence with all the advantages of early warning of attacks. The Committee realise also how pressing are the commitments of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Far East.6. Nevertheless, the Committee would be failing in their duty if they did not draw attention to the very big gap which will continue to exist in our air defence arrangements after 1940 unless steps are taken to expedite the proposals contained in the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report. Subject, therefore, to the wider considerations mentioned in paragraph 5 above, and to financial exigencies, the Committee feel bound to state their opinion that, from the point of view of Home Defence, it would be desirable to accelerate this scheme. Alternative methods have been considered : in the first (Scheme A) it is proposed that Stage 1 and Stage 2 should both be completed by the 31st March, 1940, and Stage 3 by the 31st March, 1942. This would provide a measure of anti-aircraft defence, and would be in accord with the general defensive policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government.
this manner it would still not be possible to complete the provision of the necessary equipment for the first two stages within five years unless special measures of an emergency character were undertaken to increase productive capacity in certain classes of war material, &amp;c. For example, the present capacity for production of searchlights will not allow of the large number required for the first stage being delivered in five years. It is probable that during this period the capacity will increase, but without special measures it is certain that the further requirements of the second stage could not be fulfilled by 1940. The special measures in question will necessitate His Majesty&apos;s Government entering into commitments with contractors for a programme over a number of years in order that the maximum production may be obtained from existing plant, and that the necessary additions may be made to it.9. It should be noted, however, that if the sum of  490,000 allotted for air defence by the Defence Requirements Committee were to be cumulatively increased by  120,000 yearly, it would be possible to effect a considerable acceleration without undertaking any important special measures. By making provision on a rising scale the necessity will be avoided of slowing up the development in later years owing to rising maintenance costs decreasing the sum available for the purchase of material. On this basis (Scheme B), Stages 1 and 2, which would provide an interim measure of defence for the whole area, could not be completed before the 31st March, 1943, and Stage 3 before the 31st March, 1946.Cost of Scheme B. 10.   Capital cost of the provision of Stage 1 ... ... 2,250,000Capital cost of the provision of Stage 2 ... ... 3,000^000Cost of certain additional personnel    ... ... 100,000Approximate total maintenance charges duringperiod of expansion        ...          ... ... 2,435,000Total expenditure for 8 years if Stages 1and 2 are by then completed ...      7,785,000The expenditure of  7,785,000 proposed for Stages 1 and 2 would commence at  562,000 in the first year (1935-36), rising each succeeding year by  120,000, and culminating in the last year (1942-43) in an expenditure of  1,402,500. If expenditure were to be continued after the 31st March, 1943, on approximately the same rising scale, Stage 3 could be completed in three further years, i.e., by the 31st March, 1946, the figures being as follows   Capital cost of the provision of Stage 3    ... ...      2,500,000Approximate total maintenance charges during pro-vision of Stage 3    ... ... ... ...      2,460,000Total expenditure to complete Stage 3 in years     ... ... ... ...      4,960,000The allotment required annually for the completion of Stage 3 would be approximately as follows :  1943-44    ... ... ... ...      1,520,0001944-45    ... ... ... ...      1,660,0001945-46    ... ... ... ...      1,780,0004,960,000Other factors affecting cost.11. The guns to be provided for the defence, amounting to 328 for the whole of Stages 1 and 2, will be found from war stocks, with the exception of the last 50 or 60 at the end of the second stage, which, as far as can be estimated at present, should be of new construction. It is recognised that the present 3-inch gun is in some respects out of date, and the War Office are at present considering the production of a new type of gun. There is, however, no possibility of the intro--duction of the new weapon within the next five years.
12. With reference to the estimates of costs given above, it must be pointed out that the problem of adequate defence against low-flying aircraft, including that necessary at aerodromes, has not yet been satisfactorily solved, though investigations are proceeding in this matter. The costs given above are based on the present standard of equipment for such defence, but improvements in material will undoubtedly be necessary. At present it is impossible to say when this conversion may take place or what it will cost. If the defence of aerodromes is accepted as an Air Ministry commitment, the material for this defence may be expected to be part of the establishment of air units. No guns have been provided for Royal Air Force stations, some of which will be in advance of the defence system. This matter has been referred to the Sub-Committee on the Air Defence of Great Britain, who have been directed to investigate the desirability of providing guns at Royal Air Force stations and, if they are considered essential, to suggest a scale of provision.13. The question of the employment of balloon aprons as a measure of defence is still open. Experiments are proceeding as to their utility. Similarly, trials are still proceeding with regard to the employment of acoustic mirrors; some more may be required, but no additional provision has yet been made for the extension of this system of detection.Personnel.14. The Report shows that a total of 43,000 personnel will be required to man the defences when all stages are complete. It may be possible to reduce this total slightly, so long as there is no immediate threat of war. In order to recruit these men, or to induce existing Territorial Army personnel to transfer to these units, a national air defence campaign will undoubtedly be necessary. The existing total strength of the Territorial Army is only 123,300 men, and the existing anti-aircraft units are some 60 per cent, below full establishment or 40 per cent, below the existing recruiting establishment. Large issues are involved in this proposal, and it must be realised that this provision of personnel for AA. defence will cause a considerable reduction in the strength of the trained Territorial Army Field Forces. In view of the fact that at present the total number of trained regular soldiers serving at home is only about 100,000, it will be realised that it would be quite out of the question to raise these AA. defence units on a regular basis.A .A. Defence of Ports.15. The requirements for the AA. defence of ports are not dealt with in the attached Report, as explained in paragraphs 68-73 and 105. The responsibility for making recommendations on this subject lies with the Joint Oversea and Home Defence Committee, and their report on this matter may be anticipated in due course. The cost of the provision of A.A. defences for Portsmouth, the Humber and Harwich, which will be provided in the first stage, is covered by the allotments in the Report of the Defence Requirements Committee, and the Home Defence Committee endorse the recommendations in the attached Report that similar defences for the Tyne and the Tees should be provided in the second stage, i.e., as stated above on the basis of Scheme A within the next five years. It is probable that the Joint Oversea and Home Defence Committee will make additional recommendations as regards the defence of other ports and the completion of some part of their defences within the next five years.Scientific Committee.16. The Home Defence Committee make no comment on the recommenda-tion in paragraphs 92, 93 and 113 of the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report in favour of the establishment of a Scientific Committee to give further consideration to possible means of defence, beyond noting that action has already been taken in this direction.
Control of Wireless.17. Attention is drawn to paragraph 91 of the attached Report, where the Committee emphasize the necessity of investigating, as an urgent matter, the question of the control of wireless from the point of view of wireless silence in times of danger for fear of providing enemy aircraft with directional assistance. The Committee of Imperial Defence will be aware that a Sub-Committee on the General Policy of Broadcasting in Time of War has recently been set up, and the Home Defence Committee understand that this additional question of wireless control during periods of enemy attack is already under consideration by that Sub-Committee.Vulnerability of National Industries.18. The Sub-Committee&apos;s Report, in paragraphs 84-86 and 109, draws attention to the added burden that will be placed on the Air Defence of Great Britain should existing industries of national importance or new industries (e.g., the Imperial Chemical Industries works at Billingham) be set up within the danger area. It is known that other countries have taken steps with regard to the security of essential industries. In Great Britain, the War Office have had a committee, whose Report has been forwarded to the Committee of Imperial Defence, which considered the removal of the Royal Ordnance Factories; the Air Ministry have had under consideration the question of the construction of aircraft factories outside the danger zone; and the Admiralty are also studying it from the point of view of naval establishments and commercial undertakings of importance to the Admiralty.19. From the aspect of Flome Defence, it is of the utmost importance that all possible steps should be taken to keep industries and establishments essential to the fighting efficiency of the Services outside the danger area wherever practicable; but this question goes beyond the scope of the Home Defence Committee and involves political considerations, which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment alone is in a position to determine. It is felt, however, that some special organisation is required to watch from the defence aspect the development of industries, communications, &amp;c, which will be important in war, and that an investigation should perhaps be initiated as to possible ways and means of acquainting industrial associations with the situation and preventing further development within the dangerOther Recommendations.20. The Home Defence Committee are in agreement with the remaining proposals contained in the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report, and recommend that when changes of minor detail are required, the Departments undertaking the detailed examination should be guided by these proposals and have discretion to make such alterations as they think fit. The other Services should be kept in touch with any proposals for making modifications, and if agreement is not reached, the matter should be referred to the Home Defence Committee.Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations.21. (i) The Home Defence Committee recommend the adoption of the proposals in the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report as the final scheme to be aimed at.(ii) The stages of development, however, though in accordance with the terms of reference given to the Sub-Committee last August, do not correspond with the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government as regards defence by aircraft. The provision of fighter aircraft and their reserves for Home Defence is to be completed by the 31st March, 1942, and, in principle, the parallel provision of anti-aircraft gun and searchlight defences ought to be completed by the same date. The rates of completion of the Sub-Committee&apos;s scheme and the two alternatives considered in this Memorandum are as follows : Stages.Stage 1. Stage 2.Date of completion .. Date of completion ..Stage 8. Date of completionSub-Committee&apos;s Scheme.March 31, 1940 March 31, 1945(about) March 31, 1950(about)Scheme A (involving special measures).March 31, 1940March 31, 1942Scheme B (without special measures).March 31, 1943March 31, 1946
(iii) It is estimated that the total expenditure involved (capital cost and maintenance) in providing the three stages of defence would amount by 1946 to  15-1 millions in the case of Scheme A, and  12f millions in the case of Scheme B. The difference is accounted for by the lower maintenance charges under Scheme B in the early years owing to the slower rate of expansion.(iv) Although the Committee have done their best to give a picture of the total costs involved, there are yet a number of possible requirements for which no estimate can be made. These are referred to in paragraphs 12 and 13 of this memorandum, and include the cost of additional acoustic mirrors, defence against low-flying aircraft and A.A. defences for aerodromes.(v) From the point of view of Home Defence, the Committee prefer Scheme A, but recognise that the Committee of Imperial Defence have to take into account wider considerations, such as those set forth in paragraph 5 of this memorandum. In any case, it is recommended that the scheme decided upon should be reviewed periodically, more particularly in the light of any new methods of defence that may be evolved.&apos; (Signed) A. W.

To prepare a plan for the re-orientation of the defensive S3rstem of the Air Defence of Great Britain in accordance with the approved scale of attackf referred to below.In framing this plan, the forces to be allotted to the defensive system should be kept at a minimum compatible with an adequate degree of protection.2.   In drawing up the plan it should be assumed :  (a) in the first instance that the war is against Germany, with France as ourally. The possibility of German aircraft infringing the neutrality of the Low Countries by flying over them must be allowed for, and also the possibility of Germany being able to occupy aerodromes in Belgium and Holland in the first stages of a campaign;(b) that the Greater London and Thames area is the primary objective of enemy attack;(c) that it will be important to provide protection also for industrial andother important centres, including, inter alia, explosive areas, within practical range of enemy bombing aircraft, especially those in the Midlands and the North of England;(d) that it will be necessary to provide visible protective measures for themaintenance of public morale.Any plans produced must be co-ordinated with the anti-aircraft defence of such ports as are not included in the larger scheme.3. The Report should give details of the forces and equipment required for the defensive system and should make recommendations as to the system of control and the provisional location of the forces preliminary to reconnaissance.* Major Gaussen replaced Colonel Hutton as a member of the Sub-Committee from tne 31st October, 1934, to the 4th January, 1935.I The Sub-Committee have assumed that the expression &quot; scale of attack&quot; referred to the direction from which attack was to be anticipated and the enemy to be apprehended.[11002] B 2
4. (a) The Sub-Committee will in the first instance examine the problem as a whole with a view to making recommendations as to the system or systems which would provide adequate defence.(b) Both for practical and financial reasons it will be necessary for the organisation to be completed by stages which will provide the best interim defence. The Sub-Committee will, therefore, make detailed proposals for the provision,, by stages, of the forces and equipment required; the first stage to be governed by existing financial provision but subject to such modifications as may be necessary to conform to any changes in the defence policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government.(c) An interim report should be submitted to the Home Defence Committee for approval before full details are worked out to enable a start to be made on the first of these stages as soon as possible.
INTERIM  REPORT.Part I. Considerations leading up to the Recommendations.Introduction.1. The Home Defence Committee, at their 21st Meeting, held on the 2nd August, 1934, directed that this Sub-Committee, under the Chairmanship of Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Air Defence of Great Britain, should prepare a plan for the reorientation of the defensive system of the Air Defence of Great Britain in the light of Germany&apos;s rearmament in the air and the consequent possibilities of attack from her direction. The composition of the Sub-Committee and its full terms of reference are shown on page 3.2. With the terms of reference we also had to assist our deliberations, a Memorandum prepared by the Air Staff (circulated to the Home Defence Committee under cover of H.D.C. No. 164) discussing the scale of attack to be expected from Germany, and alternative measures that might be taken in the reorientation of the air defence system. In this Paper it was pointed out that the changed direction and conditions of air attack now required the provision of defences for Northern England and the Midlands, as well as for London. The wider arc in which the attackers might now choose their objectives entailed the lengthening of our defensive system by some 100 miles. The form of defence could consist either of a continuous defence line placed between the attacker and his objectives, that is to say, running from the South coast, around London and parallel to the East coast, or of a discontinuous system of defence providing more direct cover for the most important centres only.3. We also had access to a number of past Committee of Imperial Defence documents reporting upon and making recommendations with regard to various aspects of the Air Defence of Great Britain.  These were as follows :-C.I.D. Paper No. 118-A-Report of the Joint Air Ministry and War Office Committee on Anti-Aircraft Defence. (Sometimes referred to as &quot; The Steel-Bartholomew Report.&quot;)C.I.D.

(Generally referred to as &quot; The Romer Report.&quot;)H.D.C. Paper No. 90-The Report of the Air Defence Land Line Telephone Committee. (Amended by H.D.C. Minutes Nos. 24 and 25.)
H.D.C. Minute No. 27-The  Provisional Defence Plan of  Territorial Army Air Defence Formations.We were further aware of the recommendations of the Ministerial Committee on Defence Requirements, as amended and approved by the Cabinet (C.I.D. Paper No. 1148-B).4. The original air defence scheme envisaged in the above &quot; Steel-Bartholomew &quot; and &quot; Romer &quot; Reports was drawn up to provide for the defence of London and south-east England against air attack from French territory. The direction from which attacks were expected, combined with the limited range of the aircraft at the time, confined the problem to the defence of that part of England which lies to the south-east of a line joining the Wash and the Bristol Channel.5. In preparing this Report, we have taken into consideration the contents of the afore-mentioned documents.6. Before proceeding to consider the best practical means of providing adequate air defence for Great Britain, we found it necessary to review the principles governing air defence and the means of direct defence at our disposal, and these have been restated in this Report amended in accordance with our views and taking into account present-day conditions.General Principles.7. We agreed upon the following general principles to guide us in our deliberations :  (a) that the most important function of aircraft is offensive action bybombers, but that a defensive system is also a necessity. Offensive operations are outside our terms of reference;(b) that the defensive system must consist of a proportion of the availableair forces and of A.A. defences. Both these should be limited to the lowest possible minimum;(c) that apart from their value in destroying hostile aircraft, A.A. guns are essential in any scheme of air defence, because (i) atmospheric conditions may be adverse to operations by the defending air forces;(ii) it must be expected that proportions of the hostile air forces will succeed in penetrating an aircraft defence either by weight of attack or by evading the defending aircraft;(d) that searchlights are essential to enable defending aircraft and AA.guns to engage the enemy at night;(e) that A.A. defences in the form of guns and searchlights may be employedeither to co-operate with the defending air forces or to form the sole defence of certain defined areas, and that guns should normally be disposed in areas clear of aircraft fighting zones;(/) that the defending air forces should be disposed at such a distance from the coast that there will be time for them to receive the necessary warning of attack, and reach the desired interception point before the arrival of the attacking air forces;(g) that a highly-organised intelligence system is essential for the rapid collection and distribution of information regarding the movements of friendly and hostile aircraft throughout the whole area of possible air operations.
Means of Defence.8. We agreed that the various means of defence required for the Air Defence of Great Britain should consist of (a) Fighter Squadrons of Aircraft. A total of 28) fighter squadrons has been approved. Of these, however, three are earmarked for service with the Field Force and cannot be counted upon for Home Defence purposes. At a later stage it may be advisable to employ a larger number of squadrons overseas.(b) Anti-aircraft Guns.- The batteries will be manned by the Territorial Army. No account has been taken of the existence of the Regular Air Defence Brigade (which it is proposed to duplicate) as this is designed for service overseas with the Field Force.A.A. gun sections include height and range finders, predictors and, possibly, sound locators for sound control.(c) Searchlights, with which are included sound locators. The searchlights will be manned by the Territorial Army.(d) Light Automatics for engaging low flying aircraft.(e) Balloon Aprons. A small organisation of this method of defence is at present being formed.(f) Passive Defence, which embraces air raids precautions, camouflage and other measures, such as the control of wireless and the employment of smoke.(g) An Intelligence System, which embraces an observation system including the Observer Corps, sound mirrors, coastguard stations, ships, W/T and D/F, reconnaissance aircraft, and possibly other means at present not visualised, also intelligence from other sources as to the strength and intentions of the enemy.(h) Communications. Telephonic communications are necessary throughout the defended the requirement of extreme speed precludes the use of written telegraphic messages.9. (a) The role of fighter squadrons is to attack and destroy hostile aircraft;(b) The role of A.A. guns is (i) to destroy hostile aircraft;(ii) to co-operate with fighter aircraft by disorganising enemy formations so that our fighters may engage them with the best possible chances of success, and by indicating the position of enemy aircraft by shell bursts;(iii) to deny to hostile aircraft opportunities of detailed observation and accurate bombing by forcing them to fly high and alter course at critical moments.Importance of Night Defence and of Searchlights.10. We have been impressed with the importance of providing an adequate night defence organisation. The improvement in navigational facilities and the greater reliability of engines make night-flying by aeroplanes easier than in the past. The advantage that civil aircraft are taking of existing facilities is effecting a change in attitude of mind towards flying by night, and also indicates the probability that attacks by night will be as intense as those by day. The provision of searchlights in the defence scheme consequently becomes of paramount importance and should be made pari passu with the provision of the fighter aircraft squadrons and of AA. guns. Without searchlights, the operation by night of fighter aircraft and of AA. guns would be severely crippled, and interception of the enemy bombers would become a matter of chance.Importance of Research Work.11. We have also been impressed with the need to conduct research work on the possibilities of increasing, by scientific methods, our means of defence. A recommendation to this effect is contained in paragraphs 92 and 93.
Spacing of Guns and Lights and Scale of Pkovision of Sound Locators.Guns.12. The number of batteries recommended in this Report is based on the performance of the 3-inch 20 cwt. anti-aircraft gun, spaced at a maximum of 4,500 yards between gun positions, guns being sited in pairs. A battery, which consists of 8 guns, consequently occupies 10 linear miles or 24 square miles. The effective ceiling of the present 3-inch gun is taken as being a maximum of 18,000 feet. It is recognised that the present 3-inch gun is, in some respects, out of date, and the War Office are at present considering the production of a new type of gun. This will probably be a 3 - 7-inch, which will provide for a heavier shell power and a higher ceiling, possibly up to 25,000 feet. There is no doubt that its performance will represent a very great improvement on that of the 3-inch gun.In single line defence (such as the Outer Artillery Zone referred to later in the Report), three 3-7-inch batteries could do the work of four 3-inch batteries. Therefore, when 3 - 7-inch guns are ultimately introduced, the number of batteries in the Outer Artillery Zone may be taken as three-quarters of the numbers given in this Report. Similar reductions could be made in the Inner Artillery Zone and local defences.Searchlights.13. The number of searchlight companies recommended in this Report is based on a normal spacing for the outer lights of 3,500 yards, and for the inner lights of 4,000 yards; a company consisting of 24 lights. In order to give sufficient time for the calculation of gunnery data with an aircraft speed of 150 m.p.h., the front row of searchlights must be about 6,000 yards in front of gun positions. As the speed of aircraft increases, this distance must similarly be increased.Sound Locators.14. The existing pattern of sound locator is provided on a scale of one per searchlight. A new and much more efficient instrument has, however, been designed, and it is proposed (if funds permit), to provide this instrument for the whole defence organisation. The scale of issue of this instrument to searchlights depends, to a certain extent, on the position in the defensive system, but the average provision that is envisaged is one new type locator to three searchlights. This may, as a result of experience, have to be increased to a proportion of one to two. In either case, all the other lights will require some form of sound locator, though it might be a simple one.Increased Speed of Aircraft.15. Considerable advances are now being made in the speed of aircraft and, in particular, of night-flying aircraft. Whereas in 1923 we had to consider a speed for night bombers of only about 80 miles an hour, they have already a speed of 160 miles an hour and a further increase to 200 miles an hour has already been realised and will soon become normal. Considerably higher speeds may be expected by day.16. Our fighter aircraft will gain many advantages from operating in an area where they can receive the assistance of A.A. guns. But, for operations by day, the high speeds to be anticipated have made it necessary to remove the former restrictions limiting the operations of fighter squadrons to predeter-mined areas or sectors of defence. And, at the same time, the successful development of R/T in fighter aircraft has removed the need for such restrictions.17. By night, however, the assistance of searchlights is essential for the operation of the defending fighters, in order to establish touch with the enemy; this, added to the poor facilities for navigation in fighter aircraft, makes it-necessary to adopt the system of a zone divided into sectors within which the operation of individual squadrons will be limited, unless in contact with enemy aircraft. :; ::-
18. In the past the depth of this zone has been fixed at 15 miles, but the increased speed of aircraft now makes it necessary to increase this depth to 20 miles, and consequently the number of searchlights required to illuminate it. Further increase may be necessary as performance improves.The Possibilities and Form of Enemy Attack.19. The problem of defence against air attack has been carefully examined in the light of the form of attack open to Germany. With the great increase which has recently been made in the range of bombing aircraft, a larger part of this country has become exposed to air attack. Aircraft operating from the North Sea coast of Germany can now reach the industrial centres in the neigh-bourhood of the Tyne and the Tees, the big industrial areas in Lancashire and Western Yorkshire and the industrial centres in the Midlands in and around Birmingham. All these places fall within an arc of which the centre is on the North Sea coast of Germany, in the neighbourhood of Emden and of which the radius is 375 miles. London falls well within this arc, and Portsmouth and Southampton just outside it.20. We are reminded by our terms of reference that the Greater London and Thames area will be the principal objective of the enemy air forces. This is particularly so if the enemy aircraft are able to operate from the Low Countries, where they would be strategically well placed to develop the maximum offensive against the capital. On the other hand, if for any reason their attacks on London prove difficult and costly, it is open to them at any time to switch their main concentration towards the North. The gravity of the menace to these Islands will be greatly alleviated if we can prevent the enemy operating from Belgian or Dutch territory, but this will not preclude attacks either on London or on the Midlands and the North of England, as these can still be delivered direct from German territory.21. There is no alternative, therefore, but to provide adequate air defences to cover the great centres of industry in the Midlands and in Lancashire and Yorkshire, in addition to those defences required for the London area. Our conclusions as to what can be regarded as adequate defence for these areas are based on considerations discussed in paragraphs 35-42.22. We must anticipate that air attack will synchronise with, or indeed form the commencement of, hostilities. Therefore it is evident that the whole of the defence system in this country must be working at its full efficiency in the first hour of war.The Depth of Penetration of Air Attack.23. The practical range of air bombardment is governed not only by petrol endurance, but also by the depth to which bombers can consistently penetrate organised defences. This depends upon many factors, several of which are imponderable, and the result cannot be closely assessed in peace.24. The operational radius with existing standard service aircraft based on Germany, and also that based on Belgium, is shown on Map No. 3. It can, however, be accepted that the actual depth of penetration will, in many cases, be less than that which might be expected from the operational radius and that it will decrease in proportion to enemy casualties, loss of morale, or falling off in the efficiency of pilots. As the range of aircraft increases, so will the depth of penetration, but, owing to the above considerations, it will not necessarily be increased in direct proportion.Continuous versus Discontinuous System of Defence.25. As noted in paragraph 2 above, the Air Ministry in their memorandum put forward for consideration two alternative schemes of defence continuous and discontinuous. The former comprised continuous Aircraft Fighting and Outer Artillery Zones running from Portsmouth in a north-easterly direction until in the vicinity of London, then round London to the eastward, and thence in a northerly direction to the Tees. The latter provided for local defence areas with A.A. guns and searchlights, covering the Southampton-Portsmouth area, [11002] c
London, the Midlands area (embracing Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield and Birmingham), the Tyne and the Tees.26. We considered the relative merits of these two schemes from two aspects. Firstly, in the light of the most efficient defence scheme possible; and, secondly, in the light of which scheme would provide the best interim defence during the stages of completion.27. We decided that, whichever of the two schemes was to be recommended, a vital consideration is to obtain the most efficient co-operation possible between the fighter aircraft and the A.A. defences. We concluded that in the discontinuous system the efficient operations of the fighter aircraft would be curtailed by the meteorological and topographical conditions which exist in certain localities. For instance, the topographical conditions in the Leeds-Sheffield area make it difficult or impossible to find suitable sites for aerodromes, and the atmosphere in that area is at times so thick and smoky that even if aircraft were able to leave their aerodromes there would be considerable uncertainty of their being able to land again. The meteorological conditions frequently render the details of the ground indistinguishable when viewed from the air, and make it impossible for aircraft to ascertain their location by direct observation.28. We therefore considered that co-operation between the fighter aircraft and the AA. defences would suffer unless the aerodromes and the general line of defence was pushed further to the east so as to be clear of this area. With the discontinuous system, also, while security and moral support would be provided for certain vital areas, there would be large gaps in the defence open to the activities of the enemy. Further, in the scheme to be adopted, it was very desirable that the enemy bombers should be met and engaged as early as possible after crossing the coast-line; this would give better opportunity for destroying the enemy before he reached his objectives, and would be preferable to a system in which local defence was the basis, and in which the engagement of the enemy at night would take place only in the vulnerable areas. The moral objection to leaving large stretches of the country open to uninterrupted attacks by the enemy will also,be apparent. An additional advantage in pushing the line of defence as far to the east as possible is the reduction in the probable depth of penetration (see paragraphs 23 and 24).29. Consequently, we came to the conclusion that the most effective system for the final defence lay-out was the establishment of a continuous defence system from Portsmouth, round the eastward of London, to the Tees, though in addition to this it would be necessary to provide local defence at a number of the more important centres of industry to act as a deterrent to those of the enemy who might have broken through the continuous defence zone. Local defence will also be required at selected coast ports which may be liable to enemy attack.30. It was then necessary to consider the stages by which this system should be built up, and we considered the establishment of a discontinuous system on the lines quoted above, which might, in the final stage, be linked up and consequently provide a continuous line of defence.31. The principal argument in favour of such an arrangement was that the early establishment of a ring system of defence round Greater London would not leave that area open to attack by enemy outflanking the defence zone. However, when it came to the question of linking up these discontinuous zones, it became evident that the defensive line in the final lay-out would be withdrawn into the interior of the country, would suffer from the disadvantages explained in paragraphs 27 and 28 above, and would be definitely inferior to what we now contemplate. The only other method would be a complete rearrangement in the final stage involving the use of alternative aerodromes and the duplication of operational facilities. The cost of this would be considerable, and in view of the fact that the resources at our disposal permit,, during the first five years, of the construction of a sufficient length of the continuous Aircraft Fighting Zone to provide a reasonable security to the London area, we discarded the discontinuous system and consequently an all-round defence for Greater London in the first stages. Apart from this, a continuous zone of the length now suggested will afford a considerable degree of protection to the more important objectives in the south of Fnerland which would otherwise be completely open* to attack.
32. Having decided on a continuous zone system, it was then necessary to establish the width of country that should be lighted by searchlights. Consideration of the increased speed of modern aircraft (see paragraphs 15-18) led us to the conclusion that a total width of 26 miles was necessary, this width to be made up of an Outer Artillery Zone of 6 miles and an Aircraft Fighting Zone of 20 miles.33. In the subsequent portions of this Report it will be seen that we make certain recommendations as to reducing the depth of the lighted zone below the above-mentioned figure during the interim stages. This has been necessary in view of the limited resources available in the first five years, and should not be taken to indicate that less than the full depth will provide an adequate measure of defence. ........      ;34. The details of the various stages in the construction of the defence which we recommend are given in paragraphs 45-53. It will be seen that in the first stage the defences are confined to a measure of security for the London area. This is in accordance with our terms of reference, which lay down that the Greater London and Thames area is to be taken as the primary objective of enemy attack. The first stage does not, under our scheme, provide for AA. protection for the industrial and other important areas further north. Should hostilities break out during this period, these areas must rely for their defence on the activities of our fighter aircraft unaided by searchlights.Part II. Recommendations for Plan of Defence.Defence Measures Recommended.(A diagram showing the general lay-out of this defence scheme is attached(Map No. 3).)35. We recommend that the final defence scheme to provide an adequate measure of security should consist of a continuous defence system, 26 miles in depth, except for some adjustment to cover the Thames and Medway area (see Map),* running from the Portsmouth-Southampton area, round the east of London, and thence northward to the Tees area; this system to be in contact with the defences of Greater London and to be linked up at either end with the local AA. defences of Portsmouth-Southampton and the Tees, and also to make contact with the local defences of the Humber. Local defences must also be provided for certain important centres liable to enemy attack.36.   The recommendations in detail are as follows : (a) An Outer Artillery Zone, consisting of the forward 6 miles of the continuous defence system and containing 34 A A. batteries and 19 searchlight companies.(b) An Aircraft Fighting Zone, 20 miles in depth, containing 58 searchlightcompanies. Most of the fighter squadron aerodromes will be located in this zone, and it is in this zone that our fighter aircraft will make contact with the enemy under the most favourable conditions by day, and to it their operations will be mainly confined by night.(c) An Inner Artillery Zone, 20 miles in diameter, covering Greater Londonand containing 12 AA. batteries and 6 searchlight companies.(d) Local Defences for important centres liable to attack, such as Birming-ham, Sheffield, Leeds and Manchester, for which purpose we have allocated 11 AA. batteries and 7 searchlight companies. It is recognised that increased provision will subsequently be necessary. :- *The Leading Edge of this system runs as follows:   &apos;3 m. E. of Bognor, 4 m. S. of Horsham, Haywards Heath, Mayfield, Goudhurst, Sutton Valence, Milton Regis, Leysdown, Shoeburyness, Witham, Thaxted, 5 m. E. of Cambridge, Peterborough, Bourne, 5 m. E. of Lincoln, Barton-upon-Humber, Hessle, Market Weighton, Stamford Bridge, 1 m. W. of Kirkby Moorside, Eedcar.The trace of the system has been selected so as to avoid foggy areas as far as practicable. In choosing the Leading Edge of the system, consideration has also been given to the need for sound locators to be sited 6 miles or more in front of any neighbouring aerodromes.
37. The Air Ministry have estimated the minimum requirements of fighter squadrons to provide an adequate measure of security as 25, of which 16 would normally operate in the area Portsmouth-Huntingdon, and 9 in the area Huntingdon-the Tees (see Appendix A). The Sub-Committee have taken note of this estimate, but are of the opinion that the number of squadrons must be regarded as a minimum and that in the area Huntingdon-the Tees the same squadrons might have to operate both by day and by night. They also wish to point out that, in the event of the German Air Force expanding more rapidly than anticipated when the estimate was made, an increase in fighter squadrons will become necessary.38. The total equipment requirements in A.A. defences are 57 A.A. batteries and 90 searchlight companies.Cost.39. It is difficult to give an accurate estimate of the additional cost involved by the provision of the extra Fighter Squadrons (11 in number), owing to the fact that problems connected with the raising and training of the personnel are so interlocked with the expansion of the Royal Air Force as a whole. As a guide, however, it may be taken that the Capital Cost of the new aircraft required, together with the construction of the additional aerodrome and personnel accommodation necessary in this instance, will be in the neighbourhood of  1,750,000, This cost is covered by the allotment made under the recommenda-tions of the Defence Requirements Committee. The War Office estimate that the approximate capital cost of the provision and training of the A.A. defences for the above system will be  5,500,000, in addition to the  2,250,000 covered by the recommendations of the Defence Requirements Committee. The additional cost arising from the heavy maintenance cost of A.A. units is also to be taken into account.   (See paragraphs 59 and 60.)War Strength in Personnel.40. The War Office estimate that 43,500 all ranks (at war strength) will be required to man these defences. It is at present envisaged that the personnel will be provided by converting to anti-aircraft units a proportion of the Territorial Army Field Formations.41. In conjunction with the provision of the above, we recommend that the Observer Corps should be expanded so that its organisation should cover the whole of that part of England enclosed by the east coast up to Middlesborough, a line thence from Middlesborough to Preston, a line thence from Preston, roughly parallel but to the east of the boundary of Wales as far as the south coast, and thence along the south coast in an easterly direction.42. The above recommendations do not include requirements for the A.A. defence of ports, except as regards the defences of the Thames and Medway area. These defences have been included in our recommendations as they form an integral part of the defence of London as well as affording local protection for certain naval and other establishments.Supplementary Scheme.43. While the above system will provide, in our view, a reasonable defence for England, we are of the opinion that in due course it should be supplemented first by completing the defence ring round Greater London by the provision of an Aircraft Fighting Zone and of an Outer Artillery Zone to the westward of the Inner Artillery Zone; secondly, by expanding the local defences of the Midland towns; and, thirdly, by the provision of local defences in the form of A.A. batteries and searchlights for a number of other important centres which may be subject to enemy attack.44. We have made no estimate at this stage of these supplementary requirements. The additional important centres requiring local protection, both from the point of view of maintenance of industries of national importance and of civil morale, could be best gauged when the general defence scheme is coming
to fruition in the light of the then existing probabilities regarding the penetration-tion by attacking forces. It is, for example, possible that the scope of enemy attack might have so far increased that important points in the Bristol and Liverpool areas will require some measure of A.A. defence. In addition, it is possible that the results of the research referred to in paragraphs 92 and 93 may lead to important modifications in the methods of passive defence employed at a later date.  It is impossible to estimate what these modifications may be.Programme of Development in Three Stages. (See tabulated statement of A.A. defences attached as Appendix B.)45. We recommend that the development in the provision of the full scale of defence should proceed in three stages. The situation should, however, be periodically reviewed; a general review being made at the end of the first stage.46. In this connection we would point out that the five-year period discussed in the recommendations of the Defence Requirements Committee and for which financial provision has been made, commences in 1934 and ends on the 31st March, 1939. In the Defence Requirements proposals the War Office envisage the expenditure of  2,250,000 on the scheme for the A.A. defence of Great Britain laid down in the Romer Report, this expenditure being spread over the period 1934-the 31st March, 1940. The approved allotment under this heading covers only the period ending on the 31st March, 1939, and there is, consequently, a residue amounting to about  ^-million which has not been specifically allotted. At the same time, in the Report of the Defence Requirements Committee, general approval was given for the completion of the existing scheme of air defence, so far as the War Office were concerned, by 1939-40, but not for the expansion of the existing scheme to cover the Midlands and Northern England. In our subsequent recommendations for the stages of development we have consequently, strictly speaking, departed from our terms of reference contained in para-graph 4 (b) on page 4, in that in the first stage, to end on the 31st March, 1940, we envisage the expenditure by the War Office in the last year of that stage of a sum which, though recommended by the Defence Requirements Committee, has not as yet been allotted. At the same time we have adhered to the recommenda-tions contained in the Defence Requirements Report by completing a measure of defence for the London area by 1940, and leaving the provision of A.A. defences for the Midlands and Northern England until a later stage.First Stage.   (See Map No. 1.)47. We recommend that the first stage in the defence scheme should be com-pleted within five years and by the 31st March, 1940.48. Under the approved scheme for the expansion of the Royal Air Force, the full number of 25 fighter squadrons for the Air Defence of Great Britain will be available by the end of March 1939, though 2 will not be in their final stations until the year 1940-41. The locations of these squadrons are given in Appendix A.49. The recommendations for A.A. defence under this heading will provide a degree of defence for the London area, and are as follows : (a) The partial provision of A.A. defences for the Inner Artillery Zonecovering Greater London and consisting of 8 A.A. batteries and 6 searchlight companies.(b) The provision of 9 of the A A. batteries for the Outer Artillery Zone,of which 5 are to be located in the Thames and Medway area.(c) The provision of searchlights for the Aircraft Fighting Zone and OuterArtillery Zone from Portsmouth to Huntingdon, except that the depth of the portion of the Aircraft Fighting Zone from Portsmouth to Godalming should be limited temporarily to 15 miles. This will require 36 searchlight companies.
(d) The raising and training of the&apos; additional A.A. defence units requiredfor the completion of the full scheme, viz., 40 more A.A: batteries and: 48 more searchlight companies; the equipment for this; training to be provided temporarily from the defence equipment recommended for the first stage on the understanding that should hostilities take place within five years this equipment would be withdrawn to the London area and its vicinity.(e) The expansion of the Observer Corps organisation to cover the whole area required for the full defence scheme (see paragraphs 41 and.   74-76).      -    - ,    -      . -50; During the process- of development of this first stage, it will be necessary to maintain an emergency scheme for the manning of such defences as are possible with the equipment available. As regards the illumination of the Aircraft Fighting Zone, the first priority should be given to the portions east of London.Second Stage.   (See Map No. 2.)51. Assuming that the basic organisation required for the full defence scheme has been completed by the end of the first stage, and that the aircraft defence expansion will also have been completed, the length of this second stage, as of the third, is dependent only upon the provision of - A.A. equipment and will, consequently, be governed by the annual financial provisions made. Our recommendations are as follows:  (a) The provision of searchlights for the Aircraft Fighting Zone and OuterArtillery Zone from Huntingdon to the Tees, except that the depth of the Aircraft Fighting Zone should be restricted to 15 miles during this stage.   This will require 31 searchlight companies.With regard to this lighted zone, it is desirable that it should be provided as early as possible in order that searchlight co-operation with the fighter aircraft for the night defence of the Midlands area may come into being.(b) The provision of the remaining battery requirements for the OuterArtillery Zone round London and in the southern arm, requiring a further 9 A.A. batteries.(c) The provision of 12 AA. batteries for the northern part of the OuterArtillery Zone, which will carry it to the neighbourhood of the Humber.52. If hostilities break out during this stage, it must be left for decision at the time whether the units detailed for the northern half of the. defences should move out from their recruiting areas to the defence system itself or not. This decision would be governed by the stage to which the provision of the equipment itself had advanced, and, consequently, whether this equipment would be of more practical use if employed on the defence of the local areas where the personnel were in training, or whether the supply of the equipment had advanced sufficiently to provide an efficient defence in the continuous defence system. In any case it would be necessary to maintain morale by leaving a small nucleus of A.A. defences in many of the important centres. Pending the provision of units for this specific purpose, this nucleus would be provided temporarily by a thinning of the guns and searchlights at selected places in the main defence. The possibility of employing fighter aircraft in co-operation with these local defences should also be considered at the time. . See, however, paragraph 27.)Third Stage.   (See Map No. 3.)53. Our proposals Under this heading complete the whole defence scheme as detailed above in paragraphs 35-38.   Our recommendations are as follows: (a) The completion of the Inner Artillery Zone, covering Greater London, .......S.    by the provision of a further 4 A.A. batteries.; (b) The provision of local defences for Leeds, Sheffield/Manchester and Birmingham j requiring 11 A. A. batteries and 7 searchlight companies.
(c) The provision of the additional guns for the completion of the northern part of the Outer Artillery. Zone, requiring a further 4 A.A. batteries.(d) The provision of further searchlight equipment to produce the full depth of 20 miles in the Aircraft Fighting Zone throughout the whole length of the defences, making, with the Outer Artillery Zone, a total lighted depth of 26 miles. This would require a further 10 searchlight companies.Supplementary Stage.54. As discussed in paragraphs 43 and 44, we recommend a supplementary stage in which provision is made for the expansion of the local defences in the Midland area towns, for the completion of a ring defence round Greater London, and the provision of local defences at such important centres as may, by that time, be within the range of enemy attack.Limiting Factor in any Acceleration.55. The stages in the provision of the defence which we recommend above permit of acceleration or deceleration in the provision of the final scheme, but it is necessary to draw attention to the fact that the rate of production of predictors is a limiting factor in any acceleration that it may be desired to undertake in the provision of material. We are also informed that should any acceleration be required in the second and third stages information should be given as early as possible.Approximate Cost and Number or Men required for AA. Defence. First Stage.56. The financial provision for the first stage, which will require 17 AA. batteries and 42 searchlight companies, and provide for the formation of all the further units required, is, as far as can be foreseen, covered by the recommenda-tions of the Defence Requirements Committee and will amount to  2,250,000. The number of men at war strength required to man the fully equipped units is 18,340. Expenditure arising from the formation of additional AA. units (see paragraph 49 [d)) will require a small additional allotment unless savings are available under other heads, e.g., by savings resulting from the bulk purchase of equipment.Second Stage.57. The provision of the 21 A.A. batteries and 31 searchlight companies for this stage will cost a further  3,000,000. The number of men at war strength required to man the equipment, up to and including this stage, is 33,410.Third Stage.58. The provision of the 19 A.A. batteries and 17 searchlight companies for this stage is estimated to cost a further  2,500,000. The number of men at war strength required to man the equipment, up to and including the third stage, is 43,500.59. The expenditure given above covers equipment and ammunition only. It assumes that units are provided entirely by conversion of existing units and that there is no addition of personnel. No provision is made for increased maintenance costs, which will be heavy, or for the fact that by the end of fifteen years, if not before, much of the existing equipment will be out of date or worn out and will require replacement. Costs are based on the use of war stocks of 3-inch guns. It is not possible, at present, to give any estimate&apos;of the cost of the 3-7-inch. Its provision will, however, add a large sum to the total expenditure, even allowing for the reduced number of batteries. The estimate allows for the provision of the new type Sound Locator on the scale mentioned in paragraph 14. It does not, however, include any provision for new types of weapons for defence against low-flying attack, or for any expansion in the present scale of equipment of units for this purpose.
It is not at present possible to make any accurate calculation as to tlies permanent increase to be anticipated in Army Estimates, but it will be clear that this must amount to a figure in the neighbourhood of  1,000,000 per annum.60. In view of the fact that the final scheme involves the provision of searchlights to cover an area of 9,000 square miles, and guns for an area of 2,900 square miles, the cost is not excessive. As these measures are not only necessary in themselves but are essential to the effective functioning of the; aircraft defence, it is recommended that the necessary provision should be made.Measure of Security provided during the Interim Stages.61. We are anxious to draw attention to the fact that the air defence of Great Britain cannot be considered as providing a reasonable measure of security until the third stage of our recommendations has Leon completed, and, further,, that with the financial provision made, which permits the completion of the first stage, only a partial measure of security is provided for the London area. London cannot be considered adequately protected until the full equipment of A.A. batteries in the Inner Artillery Zone and in the Outer Artillery Zone from Portsmouth to Huntingdon has been provided. Again, during the first stage, the defence of our industrial areas in the Midlands depends entirely upon the activities of the defending fighter aircraft unassisted by guns and, with the-absence of searchlights in the northern half of the defences, their effectiveness-will be severely restricted during hours of darkness.62. There appears to us to be no satisfactory alternative to the programme we have proposed, while the financial provision made for A.A. defences in the next five years remains as at present. The provision of a&apos; discontinuous system in the nature of local defence areas might provide a slightly increased security to individual areas during the early stages of the scheme, but in view of its dis-advantages for the final scheme for the reasons given in paragraphs 25-34 above,, we rejected this scheme.Responsibilities of Army and Royal Air Force.63. We think it advisable to restate the responsibilities of the Army and Royal Air Force as regards the air defence of Great Britain. These have already been defined in the Romer Report,* but require some revision to-day in view of the accepted transference of certain responsibilities from one Service to the other.64.   Our recommendations are, therefore, as follows : That the Royal Air Force be responsible (a) for the conduct of operations and combined training;(b) for the provision, organisation and training of all Royal Air force personnel employed in the air defence of Great Britain;(c) for the provision of all apparatus and for the provision and training ofthe personnel necessary for all signal communications required by the Royal Air Force, the land-line communications being provided by the General Post Office at a charge to the Air Ministry;(d) for the provision of all apparatus and for the provision and training ofthe personnel necessary for all wireless communications;(e) for the provision of all apparatus and for the provision and training of.personnel for the Observer Corps.That the Army be responsible (/) for the provision, organisation and training of all A.A. defence units.employed in the air defence of Great Britain; (g) for the provision of all apparatus and for the provision and training ofthe personnel required for all signal communications required by theArmy, the land-line communications being provided by the general post Office at a charge to the War Office.* H.D.C. Paper No. 89.
Fighting Area Command.65. In view of the extent of the air defence system of Great Britain now envisaged, we recommend that the Fighting Area Command should be sub-divided into a Northern and Southern Fighting Area and that for the purpose of this sub-division the boundary line should come at Huntingdon. We are of the opinion that it would be advantageous to have the headquarters of the Northern Fighting Area near an aerodrome, but that such an aerodrome should preferably not be a fighter aerodrome; further, the aerodrome should be one on the main communication route. Both Waddington and Grantham appear to fulfil these conditions.66. Similar reorganisation will also be required with regard to the Command of the Territorial Army Air Defence Formations.Chain of Command.67. Recommendations with regard to the chain of command were made in the Romer Report.* These require some revision to-day in view of some accepted changes, and we consequently restate them as follows :  (a) that an Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Air Defence of Great Britain,should be in supreme command and should be responsible for all decisions regarding the conduct of air defence, both on the ground and in the air, and that he should also be responsible for initiating air raid warnings in the case of hostile air attack (the system to be established with regard to the issue of air raid warnings is at present under consideration by the Home Office);(b) that the Air Officers Commanding the two Fighting Areas should beresponsible for the immediate control of defensive operations; that they should have under their direction the fighter squadrons and all Territorial Army Air Defence Formations, and that the commanders of the A.D.F. Territorial Army should be at the Fighting Area Head-quarters ;(c) that the commanders of the A.D.F. Territorial Army working under thedirection of the Air Officers Commanding the Fighting Areas should be responsible during operations for the work of the Inner and Outer Artillery Zones and the efficiency of searchlights in the Aircraft Fighting Zone;(d) that the Air Officers Commanding the Fighting Areas should issue ordersdirect to the Officers Commanding Aircraft Sectors regarding the work of the fighter squadrons; that the Officers Commanding Aircraft Sectors should issue directions to the searchlights in the sectors through the Officers Commanding Searchlights of the respective sectors, who should be at the headquarters of the aircraft sectors.Part III. Other Considerations and Recommendations.A.A. Defence of Ports.68. With the exception of the requirements for the Thames and Medway area, we make no specific recommendations with regard to the AA, defence which should be provided for those ports subject to enemy attack, as this lies within the province of the Joint Oversea and Home Defence Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence.69. Under the existing Joint Oversea and Home Defence Committee recom-mendations, the War Office have made arrangements for the provision of the full equipment of A.A. defences for Portsmouth, the Humber and Harwich to be provided by the end of our first stage proposed above. The equipment involved amounts to that required for 7 A.A. batteries and 4 searchlight companies, manned by 3,150 men, and the cost of this is covered by the recommendations of the Defence Requirements Committee.* H.D.G. Paper No. 89.
70. As a further stage, the War Office envisage the provision of 4 AA. batteries and 3^ searchlight companies, costing  310,000 and requiring 2,040 men, for the local defences of the Tyne and the Tees, but to date they have not received approval for such a step.71. We feel that these local defences should be provided before the completion of our second stage. The War Office hope to commence the training of the personnel for the Tyne and the Tees defences in the first stage, using for their training some of the equipment being provided for the Humber.72. We consider it necessary that the Staffs of the three Services should undertaike arrangements for the co-ordination of the Portsmouth naval A.A. guns and searchlights in the general air defence organisation on similar lines to those made for the Thames and Medway area and laid down in Appendix G to the existing Provisional Defence Plan of Territorial Army Air Defence Formations (circulated under cover of H.D.C. Minute No. 27).73. Similar arrangements will also be necessary in other ports provided with local defence, and where it is anticipated that naVal vessels may be present in time of enemy attack.Observer Corps Expansion.74. We referred in paragraph 41 to the expansion of the Observer Corps deemed necessary in view of the enlarged air defence scheme; this expansion to cover, generally speaking, the whole of England with the exception of the extreme North and the South-western part. Considerable increases will be required in the organisation and training requirements of the Observer Corps, and we appointed a Sub-Committee to examine and report upon the details of the organisation required for the expansion we recommend.75. The composition and terms of reference of this Sub-Committee are as follows .r-Composition.Axv Commodore O. T.

The Report and recommendations of this Sub-Committee have not yet been received.* Details of the stages omitted here.
Naval Co-operation in Enemy Aircraft Reporting.77. We understand that the question of the co-operation which can be provided by naval vessels in the matter of early intelligence of enemy aircraft approaching our coasts is under examination by the Naval and Air Staffs.78. We would emphasise that such assistance is most desirable, and it is our opinion that the area the Wash to the Tees and the area Orford Ness to Ostend are those in which naval co-operation in reporting enemy movements would be of great value, and that first consideration should be given to the establishment of sentinel patrols off the entrances to the Thames Estuary, the Humber and the Tees.79.   The development of suitable instruments for detection should be pursued.Communications.80. We draw attention to the fact that the Air Defence Land Line Telephone Committee will be required to undertake the revision of their scheme of land line communications* which will eventually be required by the Air Defence of Great Britain in the light of our recommendations for the re-orientation of the air defence of Great Britain.81. We further recommend that the Air Defence Land Line Telephone Committee should include a representative from the Fighting Area. The Air Officer Commanding, Fighting Area, will nominate a representative when required.82. At present there is a break in the continuity of reporting enemy aircraft between the Observer Corps and the searchlights. We consequently recommend that at the junction of the Observer Corps area and the illuminated area, respective Observer Posts and searchlight sections should be placed in direct communication so that enemy aircraft can be handed over from one to the other. It would be necessary for the Air Defence Land Line Telephone Committee to work out the details of the communications required to effect this.Restrictions on Firing by AA. Batteries into the AircraftFighting Zone.83. It is at present an accepted principle that aircraft should have the sole use of the Aircraft Fighting Zone and be completely safe from any danger of shellfire, and, consequently, AA. batteries are restricted from firing at targets . within the Aircraft Fighting Zone. However, to-day greater freedom has been given to the defending aircraft, and their operations by day are not confined to the Aircraft Fighting Zone. It is also apparent that there may be targets presented to the A.A. batteries which, though in the Aircraft Fighting Zone, may not be in the vicinity of defending aircraft. While we make no specific recommendation on the matter of the limitations imposed on the artillery with regard to the Aircraft Fighting Zone, we suggest that the question should be investigated anew by the authorities concerned.Industries of National Importance in Time of War.84. Our attention has been drawn to the importance of providing air defence for various industries of national importance which are at present sited within range of enemy air attack. Unfortunately, some of these industries are so placed that aircraft defence is very difficult, as their short distance from the coast and consequently from the probable line of first warning precludes the possibility of the enemy being engaged by the defending aircraft before they have arrived over their objective.85. It may be necessary, therefore, to make a special provision of AA. guns and searchlights to cover these areas, but such provision has not been included in our recommendations. In order to provide any reasonable chance of beating the attack off before the bombs are dropped, provision on a* Previous Eeport H.D.C. Paper No. 90.
large scale would be necessary. A particular example of the vulnerability of a factory of the utmost national importance is Imperial Chemical Industries located at Billingham. The desirability of locating industries of national importance well to the westward of the defence system cannot be overstated, and any inducement that will result in preventing the erection of new factories within the danger area, or the expansion of existing industries in that area, will lessen the responsibilities of the Service Departments.86. We therefore recommend that this aspect of the defence problem should be borne constantly in mind, and every step possible taken to exclude future industrial undertakings of national importance from the danger area.Other Matters urgently requiring Development or Investigation.87. We are impressed by the inadequacy of our existing measures of defence against low-flying attack. Such&apos; forms of attack must be anticipated In particular, we have in mind the Thames area and its vulnerability to such attack. Our aerodromes would also require adequate defence measures against low-flying attack.88. We consequently recommend that investigations for improving the defence arrangements against low-flying attack should be pressed forward with the utmost vigour. In addition to the provision of the most suitable type of weapon on the ground, we recommend the examination of alternative methods of defence by a Joint Committee of the three Services.89. The provision of AA. defences for our aerodromes, especially those that are in front of the defence system, is a matter that should be investigated at a very early date.90. We would express the hope that progress is being made by the Air Ministry with the arrangements for the establishment of wireless interception stations, both for locating enemy aircraft and for securing air intelligence. It is important that this aspect of air defence should not lag behind other arrangements.91. Our attention has been drawn to the necessity of investigating as an urgent matter the question of the control of wireless, both from wireless and broadcasting stations, during the periods of enemy air attack, particularly when weather conditions are such that wireless emissions may prove of navigational assistance to the incoming enemy. It would appear that the responsibility for exercising such control has not yet been fixed.92. Our attention has been drawn to the Report of the Anti-Aircraft Research Sub-Committee, which was taken by the Committee of Imperial Defence at its 234th meeting held on the 29th March, 1928, and we recommend that some such scientific committee should be revived to-day to give further consideration to possible means of defence. In order that the best possible use may be made of this committee, its composition should be strong and it should be able to draw from the best brains obtainable in the country. It should also have wide terms of reference and be endowed, if considered necessary, with special powers for the advancement of its recommendations.93. As an example of a line of investigation of purely passive defence affecting the scheme of defence which we have drawn up, we mention the conditions often obtaining in the Midland areas, where low cloud and smoke palls under certain weather conditions preclude the possibility of an attacking enemy identifying his object. We suggest that the possibility of artificial smoke pro-duction in industrial areas deserves investigation. Economy in the number of A.A. units may be achieved through such a means of defence.Points to Note.94. The position of the Headquarters of the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Air Defence of Great Britain, is one of importance, but we make no specific recommendations under this heading as the matter has been referred direct to the Committee of Imperial Defence.** C.I.D. Paper No. 202-A and Minutes of the 267th Meeting of the C.I.D., item (1).
95. It is recommended that the Reports of Committees formed to deal with the details of organisation, intelligence, communications, &amp;c, shall be submitted through our Committee and shall be included in the same series as our Report.Part IY. Summary of Main Conclusions and Recommendations.Full Scale of Defence required.   (See Map No. 3 and Appendix A.)96. We recommend that, in addition to a minimum of 25 fighter squadrons, the defence scheme should consist of an Outer Artillery Zone of guns and search-lights and an Aircraft Fighting Zone with searchlights only stretching from Portsmouth, around London, to the Tees, an Inner Artillery Zone of guns and searchlights covering Greater London, and local defences for the principal Midland towns. The establishment of this AA. defence requires 57 A.A. batteries and 90 searchlight companies, manned by 43,500 men at war strength and at a capital cost of at least  5,500,000, in addition to that already covered by the recommendations of the Defence Requirements Committee; the recurrent cost probably involving an eventual addition of  1,000,000 per annum to Army Estimates.   (Paragraphs 35-40 and 58-60.)Observer Corps.97. We recommend that the Observer Corps organisation should be expanded, and have appointed a Sub-Committee to investigate the matter. (Paragraphs 41 and 74-76.)Supplementary Scheme.98. We recommend that with the completion of the defence scheme recommended, consideration should be given to the completion of the ring defence round Greater London, the expansion of the Midland town defences, and the provision of local defences in other important centres more remote from the enemy.   (Paragraphs 43, 44 and 54.)Stages of Development.99.   We recommend that the scheme should be carried out in three stagesA first stage (see Map No. 1) providing, in addition to the 25 fighter squadrons, a portion of the Inner Artillery Zone in London, searchlights from Portsmouth to Huntingdon in the Outer Artillery Zone, 9 batteries only in the Outer Artillery Zone (5 to be located in the Thames and Medway area), searchlights from Portsmouth to Huntingdon in the Aircraft Fighting Zone (a reduced depth being accepted from Portsmouth to Godalming), the xaising and training of defence units for the whole defence scheme (equip-ment for their training being loaned from the above provision), and the expansion of the Observer Corps organisation to. cover the whole area required for the defence scheme.   (Paragraphs 47-50.)A second stage (see Map No. 2) providing the searchlights for the Outer Artillery Zone from Huntingdon to the Tees, the searchlights for the Aircraft Fighting Zone from Huntingdon to the Tees (a reduced depth being accepted), the remaining batteries for the Outer Artillery Zone from Portsmouth to Huntingdon, and 12 batteries for the Outer Artillery Zone from Huntingdon to the Tees. During the process of development and until the illuminated zone is complete, emergency schemes for the employment of AA. units for the local defence of Midland and Northern centres will require preparation.   (Paragraphs 51 and 52.)A third stage (see Map No. 3) completing the defence scheme by providing the local defences for the Midland town areas, the additional guns to complete the Inner Artillery Zone and Outer Artillery Zone from Huntingdon to the Tees, and additional searchlights to equip the Aircraft Fighting Zone throughout to its full depth.   (Paragraph 53.)Cost and Personnel required.100. We draw attention to the fact that the equipment for the first stage requires 17 AA. batteries and 42 searchlight companies, to be manned by 18,340 men. The cost of this is covered by the recommendations of the Defence Require-ments Committee, and amounts to  2,250,000.   (Paragraph 56.)
The second stage. involves the provision of an additional 21 A.A. batteries and 31 searchlight companies, costing  3,000,000, and requiring, with the units equipped under the first stage, a total of 33,410 men.   (Paragraph 57.)The third and final stage requires a further 19 A.A. batteries and 17 search-light companies, costing  2,500,000, and involving a full war strength of 43,500 men to man the defences throughout.   (Paragraph 58.)We recommend that the situation, should be periodically reviewed, a general review being undertaken at the end of the first stage. &apos; ;Security during the Interim Stages.101. We ask that our opinion may be endorsed that the air defence of Great Britain cannot be considered as providing a reasonable measure of security until the third stage of our recommendations has been completed, and that with the completion of the first stage only a partial degree of security is provided for the London area, the defence of the Midlands resting on fighter aircraft without the assistance of guns by day or of searchlights by night.  (Paragraphs 61 and 62.)Responsibilities of the Army and Royal Air Force.102. We ask that our statement of the responsibilities of the Army and Royal Air Force as regards the air defence of Great Britain may be endorsed. (Paragraphs 63 and 64.)Fighting A rea Command.103. We recommend that the Fighting Area Command should be sub-divided into a Northern and Southern Fighting Area, and that reorganisation to meet this would also be required as regards the Command of the Territorial Army Air Defence Formations.   (Paragraphs 65 and 66.)Chain of Command.104. We ask that our statement with regard to the Chain of Command may be endorsed, . (Paragraph 67.)A .A. Defence of Ports.105. We have made no specific recommendations with regard to the scale of A.A. defence for Home ports other than the Thames and Medway area. We draw attention to the fact that the A.A. defences of Portsmouth, the Humber and Harwich will be provided by the end of our first stage. We recommend that the A.A. defences for the Tyne and the Tees should be provided before the completion of our second stage. (Paragraphs 68-71.) We recommend that the question of arrangements for the co-ordination of the naval A.A. defence of Portsmouth, and possibly other ports, with the general or local air defence system should be examined.   (Paragraphs 72 and 73.)Naval Co-operation in Enemy Aircraft Reporting.106. We draw attention to the valuable assistance that can be provided by sentinel patrols with naval craft in areas to the east of the east coast; a subject which is under consideration by the Admiralty and Air Ministry. The development of suitable instruments for detection should be pursued. (Paragraphs 77-79.)Communications.107. We draw attention to the fact that the land line communications will require revision in the light of the expansion in the Air Defence of Great Britain recommended, and we recommend that the Committee undertaking this work should include a representative from the Fighting Area. We also recommend the provision of direct communication between respective observer posts and searchlight sections at the junction of the Observer Corps area and the lighted zone.   (Paragraphs 80-82.)Restrictions on Firing by A.A. Batteries.108. We suggest that the question of the limitations imposed on A.A. batteries with regard to firing into the Aircraft Fighting Zone deserves recon-sideration in the light of the greater freedom now given to the defending fighter aircraft.   (Paragraph 83.)
Location of Industries of National Importance.109. We draw attention to,the added burden that will be placed on the Air Defence of Great Britain should existing industries of national importance be expanded, or new industries set up, within the danger area, and we recommend that this aspect of the defence problem should be borne constantly in mind. (Paragraphs 84-86.)Defence against Low Flying A attack.110. We recommend that investigations for the improvement of defences against low flying attack should be pressed forward with the utmost vigour. (Paragraphs 87 and 88.)A .A. Defences for A aerodromes.111. We recommend that the question of the AA. defence of aerodromes should be investigated at a very early date.   (Paragraph 89.)Control of Wireless.112. We recommend that the question of control of our own wireless during periods of enemy attack should be investigated.   (Paragraph 91.)Anti-aircraft Research.113. We recommend for consideration the question of setting up a strong scientific committee to examine all possible new means of defence. We consider that inter alia there is a possibility of the employment of artificial smoke as a means of passive defence.   (Paragraphs 92 and 93.)(Signed) R.

MOST SECRET,A.D.R. 12.Copy Nb.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Sub-Committee Oh Air Defence Research.INTERIM REPORT.Introduction.1. IN the Conclusions of the Sixty-fifth Meeting of the Ministerial Committee on Defence Requirements it was agreed to defer consideration of the Re-orientation of the Air Defence System of. Great Britain (the Brooke-Popham Report (Papers Nos. D.C.M. (32) 142* and 140)) until it could be examined in the light of the Conclusions of the Air Defence Research Sub-Committee.The Air Defence Research Sub-Committee were instructed to forward an Interim Report summarising their, conclusions as affecting the scheme for the Reorientation of Great Britain&apos;s Air Defences as soon as practicable.Means of Defence.2. The Committee has considered the Report on the Re-orientation of the Air Defence System of Great Britain, with special reference to the means of defence at present available and the lines of research that are being pursued. The means of defence include (a) early warning systems;(b) fighter aircraft;(c) anti-aircraft guns and machine guns;id) searchlights and other means of illumination; and (e) air obstacles of the balloon-apron type.There is general agreement between the Services and the scientists as to the problems which have to be solved, and as to the inadequacy and limitations of the existing means of defence.Defence by Fighter Aircraft.3. While the experiments which are being undertaken will, it is hoped, produce supplementary means of defence,, fighting aircraft are essential and at present remain the most effective method (apart from counter-bombing).4. In order to enable fighter aircraft to operate effectively, or indeed at all by night, two factors are essential: firstly, early detection of the approach of[11770]* Also Paper No. A.D.R. 3.
2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, June 25, 1935.enemy aircraft, and, if possible, continuous location of their course; and, secondly, an efficient system of searchlights, or other methods of illumination.Experiments with regard to the provision of adequate early warning have -already been instituted, and the work of the Scientific Committee already discloses very favourable prospects. The Sub-Committee are of the opinion that it is of the greatest importance that secrecy should be maintained as regards the existence even of these experiments as long as possible.Anti-Aircraft Gun Defences.5. Statistics provided by the Meteorological Section of the Air Ministry have been examined. Though they are admittedly incomplete, they do, however, indicate that over periods aggregating to 50 per cent, of the total time in one year cloud sufficiently general to obscure vision exists at heights of 8,000 feet and below. If we deduct from these periods the times during which the aircraft cannot fly at all (at present indeterminate), there must remain a very high proportion of times when (a) aircraft by flying above cloud could escape observation; and (b) when, equally, aircraft must come below 8,000 feet to bomb anything in the nature of a specific target, e.g., London Docks.Nevertheless, we incline to the view that, whilst the direct effect of gun-fire can be over-estimated, guns will always remain necessary, certainly in the inner, and probably in the outer, zone. Moreover, the results which we anticipate in regard to detection and location will greatly improve the efficacy of gun-fire, especially with the improved type of gun which the War Office have now on trial order. It will be borne in mind that 3-inch guns already exist in large numbers, and there is, therefore, a great advantage in training batteries with these existing weapons.Searchlights.6. Illumination is an essential adjunct to defence by either fighter aircraft or anti-aircraft guns, and although, as already indicated in paragraph 5, the utility of searchlights will frequently be much restricted by adverse meteoro-logical conditions, we feel that it is impossible to reduce with safety the proposed searchlight programme.Experiments.7. The Committee has recommended the prosecution or initiation of the researches detailed in the conclusions of the Second Meeting of the Sub-Committee on Air Defence Research. These conclusions, together with a statement of the action taken and present position, are attached as an annex to this report.Conclusions.8. The experiments in detection and location, and the development of a new technique may make possible later on a reduction in the number of the Observer Corps originally estimated as necessary. It is obviously desirable to engage, harry and deflect the enemy as far as possible from his objective, and as the system of detection improves, it may become possible to throw the outer zone of defence further forward. We regard it as of great importance that the whole system of defence should, as far as possible, be designed on a mobile basis. For the present, however, the Committee are of the opinion that the recommendations of the Brooke-Popham Committee should be accepted pending the practical development and provision of the apparatus and weapons now being explored. This question will have to be kept under constant review, but it does not materially affect the character or scale of the defence.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee : (Signed) P. CUNLIFFE-LISTER (Chairman).
ANNEX.Amended Conclusions of the Second. Meeting of the Sub-Committee on&quot;Air Defence Research, held on May 27, 1935, showing Action taken up to June 18, 1935 (3rd Meeting).It was agreed  1  Smoke Screens.(i) That research in the production of smoke screens to obscure an area should not be undertaken;(ii) That the question of the provision of local smoke screens in particular localities should be investigated by the Air Raids Precautions Committee;Action Taken:This question has been taken up by the Air Raid Precautions Depart-ment of the Home Office; &quot;. .   ,.(iii) That the War Office should be asked to endeavour to obtain information about the experiments alleged to have been carried out in Belgium in the pro-duction of smoke by burning special material in ordinary fire-places;Action Taken:The War Office are taking steps to obtain this information, which is as yet not available.2. Guns and Searchlights.To recommend that experiments be undertaken by the War Office, Air Ministry and Admiralty in conjunction with the Tizard Committee, to determine the effective range of searchlights for illuminating aircraft, both for defending aircraft and for guns on the ground, and to assess the possibilities of gun-fire as an indication to defending aircraft of the position of hostile aircraft. Such experiments to embrace the problems of :  (a) Searchlights in relation to guns;(b) Searchlights in relation to aircraft;(c) Guns in relation to defending aircraft.Action Taken:A combined programme of experiments has already been drawn up and is under consideration between the War Office, Air Ministry and the Tizard Committee.3. Other Methods.To take note of the methods not recommended for further investigation by the Tizard Committee Report (paper No. A.D.R. 10, pages 7 and 8).4. Location and Detection Experiments.(i) That every encouragement should be given to the experiments now being undertaken at Orfordness in location and detection of aircraft, and that all facilities to that end should be provided;(ii) That such experiments should be carried out in conjunction with those required by the Navy;(iii) That we should assume that a range of detection of 50 miles within five years would be achieved, and plan accordingly;Action Taken:Mr. Tizard reported that his Committee had already witnessed certain experiments which had been carried out successfully under very adverse atmospheric conditions.His Committee were satisfied that these experiments were progressing satisfactorily.
5. Wire Barrages.To recommend that the Air Ministry, in conjunction with the Tizard Committee, should immediately undertake experiments in the use of mobile wire barrages supported by aircraft.Action Taken:The necessary preliminary work is already in hand.6. Pilotless Aircraft.To ask the Tizard Committee to submit a programme of the proposed experiments in connection with pilotless aircraft;Action Taken:The Tizard Committee have already prepared a Draft Report, which will be submitted for the consideration of the Committee in due course.7. Intelligence.To recommend that every step should be taken by the Air Staff to obtain intelligence as to the probable nature of the attacks which were to be expected.Action Taken:The Air Staff have prepared a paper which will be forwarded to the Committee.8. Meteorological Data.(i) To ask the War Office and Air Ministry to provide information as to their exact requirements from the Meteorological Service.(ii) To ask the Air Ministry to put in hand the necessary executive steps for the provision of a special staff to provide the meteorological data required.Action Taken:    .   .It was agreed that the Master-General of the Ordnance, the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff and Mr. Tizard should consult the Director of the Meteorological Office and prepare a programme.9. Re-orientation.That with guns, searchlights, wire barrages and other means of defence on a mobile basis, no re-orientation need at present be considered.10. Rockets.To recommend that experiments with rockets should be proceeded with by the War Office in conjunction with the Royal Air Force Experimental Establishment, at Farnborough.Action Taken:The War Office reported that the matter was progressing.11. Thermite Bombs.To take note that the War Office were carrying out experiments in connection with Thermite Bombs in consultation with the Air Raid Precautions Department of the Home Office.Action Taken:The War Office have taken up this question with the Home Office.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.
