Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   July 1935.141SECRET.Copy No. ,67D.P.R. 11.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements.SINGAPOEE DEFENCES.REPORT.1. THE Committee of Imperial Defence, at their 270th meeting on the 11th July, 1935, referred to the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements the consideration of proposals for proceeding to the Second Stage of the Singapore Defences, which had been raised by the Chiefs of Staff in C.I.D. Paper No. 408-C.*2.   There are two questions involved :  ,(a) Whether, on completion early in 1937 of Stage I of the defences, weshould continue with Stage II.(b) The allocation of the recent gift of  500,000 from the Sultan of Johore.These two questions are related to each other, since the Sultan&apos;s gift enables us to make a start on the 2nd Stage of Singapore, but the Services, at present, have authority only for Stage I and require further authority before Stage II could be initiated.3. The Sultan&apos;s gift of  500,000 was given on the understanding that it should be used for accelerating the completion of the defences at Singapore. We consider that it should be spent on local defences, which the Sultan can see, and we have examined the various means by which this object can best be fulfilled.4. The Admiralty, who might have asked for a contribution from the Sultan of Johore&apos;s gift towards the completion of the Local Naval Defences, are so concerned in the completion of the gun defences to the point where they will provide a reasonable deterrent to sea-borne attack that they have waived their claim.5.   The War Office proposals for fixed defences are as follows : In addition, the War Office put forward a further proposal to station a third British Battalion at Singapore. This is a matter which does not fall within the scope of the Stages of the Singapore programme, but it was introduced, in order that, so far as possible, all future commitments for the defence of Singapore should be presented together rather than piece-meal. We are agreed, however, that the question of the third Battalion should not be considered in connection with the allocation of the Sultahs gift, and will have to be taken up separately.Three 6-inch Batteries and Defence Electric Lights Provision of two 15-inch guns ... ... 90,600 468,500559,100* cope attached.
6. The provision of Air Forces at Singapore up to an eventual 5 squadrons has already been approved, but the Air Ministry have pointed out that local facilities for the operation of air units could be considerably accelerated if some part of the Sultan&apos;s gift were made available for the purpose.Their full proposals were : (a) Acceleration of construction of R.A.F. Base atSeletar           ...          ...          ...          ... 94,000(b) Additional work at second aerodrome           ... 26,000(c) Towards provision of a third aerodrome       ... 30,000(d) Accommodation for a non-Regular Flight forartillery spotting ... ... ...        40,000190,0007. It will be seen from the above figures that the Sultan&apos;s gift is not sufficient to cover all the proposals put forward by the two Services, and we have therefore had to consider on what items it should be spent in order to get the best value in terms of security of the fortress.8. After discussing the matter at some length with the Chiefs of Staff of the three Defence Services, we recommend that the  500,000 gift by the Sultan of Johore should be allocated as follows :-(i)  400,000 to the War Office to be devoted to the completion of the 15-inchgun batteries at Bee Hoe (3 guns) and of Buona Vista (2 guns), (ii)  100,000 to the Air Ministry to meet the cost of accelerating the pre-paration of the Second and Third landing grounds, and for providing accommodation for the non-Regular (spotting) flight at the Civil aerodrome.9. The greater part of the above expenditure is self-contained, forming part of Stage Ii of the Singapore Defences, but without necessarily involving a com-commitment to all the details of that Stage, which, according to past decisions, were to &quot; await a further recommendation by the Committee of Imperial Defence.&quot; We consider that the further steps required on the part of all Services subsequent to Stage I should now be worked out and submitted through the usual channels to the Committee of Imperial Defence.10.   Our conclusions and recommendations are summed up as follows : -(a) That without prejudice to the final scheme for the provision of Stage II of the Singapore Defences, the gift of the Sultan of Johore amounting to  500,000 should be distributed as follows : (i)  400,000 to the War Office to be devoted to the completion of the 15-inch gun batteries at Bee Hoe (3 guns) and Buona Vista (2 guns).(ii)  100,000 to the Air Ministry to meet the cost of accelerating the preparation of the second and third landing grounds and for providing accommodation for the non-regular (spotting) flight at the civil aerodrome.,(&amp;) That the Joint Oversea and Home Defence Committee should consider .       and report what further steps are required on the part of all Services to complete the defences of the base subsequent to Stage I...... .( Initialled on behalf of the Sub-Committee :&apos;    &apos; &apos;: J.

ENCLOSURE.408-C.(Also Paper No. C.O.S. 386.)SINGAPORE: ACCELERATION OF PROVISION OF DEFENCES.Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.THE First Stage of the land defences of Singapore, as authorised,* will be completed during the financial year 1936-37, including the provision of three 15-inch guns. The financial requirements of this Stage are covered by funds made available under the Defence Requirements Report, t The term &quot; First Stage&quot; was, however, applied only to land defences and did not refer to the provision of air units, which were dealt with as a separate question. Air units have been approved! at the figure of 5 squadrons, together with operational facilities of a further 4 reinforcing squadrons from Iraq and India. Of the above 5 squadrons, three are now at Singapore, one is at home pending the completion of its necessary accommodation at Singapore, the fifth will, under present arrangements, be formed in England in 1938. Work on the Local Naval Defences at Singapore, as approved by the Committee of Imperial Defence, I is proceeding within the amounts annually made available for the remedying of Naval deficiencies.2. The Committee of Imperial Defence, in approving the First Stage of the defences, agreed that &quot; The Second Stage should await a further recommendation by the Committee of Imperial Defence.&quot;!In view of the fact that the defences to be provided under, Stage I would be completed before the end of 1936-37, the War Office have had under consideration with the General Officer Commanding, since the beginning.of the year, the requirements to be submitted under Stage II. At the same time, an investigation carried out within the War Office has served to confirm the recommendation of the General Officer Commanding that another battalion is necessary.3. In the normal course these proposals would have been submitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence, in accordance with the decision referred to above, with a view to the provision of funds in 1936-37. The gift of  500,000 hy the Sultan of Johore, however, enables the question of proceeding with the Second Stage of the defences to be dealt with immediately, and as the gift was specifically intended to be devoted to the acceleration of the defences, an early decision is obviously necessary.4. In previous investigations into questions of policy affecting the defence of Singapore it was found desirable that the broad issues involved should be considered by a small committee composed of Ministers, for example, the enquiry carried out in 1925 by the Curzon Committee and the Coast Defence Committee of 1932. Now that the Second Stage of the Singapore defences is in sight, and as authoritative decisions are required-before it can be initiated, we would ask* Cabinet 27 (33), Conclusion 5.f CP. 205 (34).i C.I.D. Paper No. 394-C.   C.I.D. 264th Meeting, Minute 3.g OLD. Paper No. 395-C.   OLD. 267th Meeting, Minute 4.II OLD. 256th Meeting, Minute 1, Conclusion (c).
that a small Ministerial body be appointed to whom we may put forward our alternative proposals. The matter is of some urgency, as unless a decision can be arrived at before the recess it may be deferred until the autumn. We have pointed out, on many occasions, the unfavourable strategical situation which will arise in the Far East in 1936 and subsequent years, and we feel it would be unjustifiable to delay, by however short a space of time, any steps which can be taken to improve the defensive position.(Signed)      EENLE CHATFIELD.A.
