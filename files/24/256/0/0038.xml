(This Document is the property of His BritannicMajesty&apos;s Government;e g. rjlii &quot; copy M0.1... ^ T.y......pT 178(35)CABINET Proposed..JSnlar Canning.....EnoXosure..memorandum I hy the First Commissioner of Works.As some of my colleagues may he aware, strong representations have recently heen made by the All Parties Amenities Group of the Houses of Parliament, the London County Councils, the Middlesex County Council and other interested &quot;oodles that the building site adjoining the Canning Enclosure, known as .14,  16 and 16 Great George Street and coloured red on the attached site plan,  should he preserved as an open space and placed under the control of the Commissioners of Works-,It might be useful if, at the outset, I give a very brief resume of the history of events leading up to the present situation.     Proposals for the redevelopment of this site for offices were first submitted in the early part of 1931 to my Department, as the authority responsible for the control and management of the adjoining open spaces In Parliament Square, by the Westminster House Real Property Company, who had then acquired (or were in the process of acquiring) a building lease of the site for 999 years from the then freeholders,  the Ecclesiastical Commissioners *In the meantime the London County Council;, as the Town planning Authority for this area, passed in   April Is33 a Town Planning resolution authorising the preparation of a town planning scheme for a specified area in Westminster which
included, the site proposed for development.     The object of this resolution was to enable the Council to obtain effective control over the height and character of the buildings to be erected on this site and the building promoters were accordingly required to obtain the approval of the London County Council to the plans of the proposed buildings      In addition^ plans of the proposed new building were submitted to the Royal Fine Art Commission as the authority appointed by Royal Warrant to enquire into any schemes which might appear to affect amenities of a national- or public charactero     Plans of the proposed building were generally approved, by the London County Council and the Fine Art Commission by the end of July 1934 and. easements of light and air over the Canning Enclosure were agreed by my Department with the building promoters by the end of August 1954*.In January.  1935? however, notice was given by the Middlesex County Council of their intention to promote a Bill in Parliament to acquire compulsorily the site of the buildings known as 14-,  15 and 16, Great George Street and &quot;to use the lands so acquired for the purpose of extending the Guildhall and for other purposes of the County and purposes incidental thereto&quot;* This Bill was subsequently withdrawn in.May,  1935* as negotiations had been satisfactorily completed for the acquisition of the &quot;property ,by the CounciloSubsequently, I was asked to receive, on behalf of the Prime Minister, a deputation at the House of Commons on the 30th July-,  1935b which included representatives of the All Parties Amenities Group of the Houses of Parliament* the London County Council, the Middlesex County Council and the London Society,,     This deputation was the outcome of a resolution passed at a meeting of the All Parties Amenities Group which had heard statements by the Middlesex County Council and theSo
London County Council on the question of preserving this site as an open spaceaThe representative of the Middlesex County Council stated that both his Council and the London County Council took the view that? as the amenities of Parliament Square, which was the centre of the political life of the nation? were a national concern and as the ante in question, if it were retained as an open space, would be under the control and in charge of the Office of Works, His Majesty1s Government ought to be the primary mover in connection with the preservation of the site as an open space *      It was further stated that the Middlesex County Council were now the unencumbered, freeholders of the site, that the total cost to the Council of purchasing the property? including the acquisition of all freehold and lease-hold interests, compensation for disturbance, legal and other costss etco, was  370,000 and that there was unanimity among all parties of the Council in the view that this site should be olear-ed and incorporated in the existing Canning Enclosure, and that othsrwJ.se,  it would be necessary for the Council to erect new offices on the whole of the site.This opinion was fully endorsed by representatives of the London County Council.,  the London Society ana other parties represented at the meeting who emphasised thati-(a) the opportunity that now&quot; presented Itself of effectingthis most desirable improvement in the amenities of Parliament Square should not be missed, and(b) it was -a aational obligation to preserve this site asan open space.3 a
It was further stated that the London County Councils the Middlesex County Council and probably the Westminster City Councils would each he prepared, if the Government decided in favour of the schemes to make a contribution towards the cost of preserving this site as an open space but they felt that, until the Government had reached a decision on the merits of the scheme, there was no firm ground for considering the details of the contribution to be made by each authority6The following persons attended the deputation andin introducing the deputation Sir P. Ilurd, the ActingChairman, intimated that the Archbishop of Canterbury hadspecially desired to be associated with the views expressedby the deputationSir Percy Ilurd, M.Po Secretary, ParliamentaryAmenities Group-Lord Conway of AllingtonThe Viscount Esher London SocietycThe Rt. Hon. Sir Herbert Samuel, GoCoBo, MSP,Sir William Davison,KoBoTSo,   Mo P.Captain Sidney Herbert, HoPo Member for Abbey Divisionof Y/estrainsteroMr. Gllfrld Craig Middlesex County Councils jMr. Radclyffe Clerk to Middlesex Council:Mr. Culpin London County Council.The Chancellor of the Exchequer has not found himself able to entertain the suggestion of any Exchequer contribution.     He has suggested however that, in view of the possible political reactions in Parliament, the London County Council and the press in respect of this question, I should lay the case before the Cabinet so that all Ministers may have
an opportunity of expressing an opinion on it*I do so accordingly;,   and I should like to support the views put forward &quot;by the Deputation in favour of a proposal which would increase the Amenities of Parliament and the Abbey so extensivelyo      It would9 in my opinion^ be nothing less than a tragedy if the opportunity that has now arisen of making this great and desirable improvement to the appearance of the Abbey and Parliament square - at the very centre of the political life of the Nation and the Empire --were to be lostj particularly as the responsible local authorities ap&quot;pear to be willing to bear their fair share of the cost-:      Equallys I consider that any scheme^ such as this9 - &quot;for improving the amenities of Parliament Souare, V/westminster Abbey and the- Houses of Parliaments should primarily be regarded as a national rather than a local responsibility and I would suggest that it would not be inappropriate that the national contribution towards this improvement scheme should be assessed at two-fifths of the total costs the balance of three fifths being shared by the three local authorities concerned viz0 the London County Councils the Middlesex County Council and the Westminster City CouncilsHol!e Office of Y/orkSj, &amp;q034th September,  1935.
