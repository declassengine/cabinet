277Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1935. w 9 8SECRET. Copy No.   4 3CP. 167 (35).CABINET.ITALO-ETHIOPIAN DISPUTE.Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE Cabinet will remember that on the 10th July they decided that a study should be initiated in the Foreign Office of the problems likely to arise in the event of an outbreak of war between Italy and Abyssinia. A memorandum setting out the views of the Foreign Office on this matter has been prepared, but in so far as a considerable number of questions which arise in this connexion concern other Departments either exclusively or in part, the Foreign Office, while it may be able to indicate the general nature of the problem, and possibly to make suggestions in relation to it, is not in the position to carry out a complete study of the question. The Foreign Office memorandum, which must therefore be regarded merely as a preliminary exposition of the problem drawn up from the point of view of the Foreign Office, has been circulated to the other Departments concerned and to the Inter-departmental Abyssinian Committee with a view to a comprehensive study of the question being made. In view, however, of recent developments and of the increasing urgency of the situation, I feel that my colleagues should be informed of the views of the Foreign Office on this point, and therefore circulate to them the Foreign Office memorandum.S. H.Foreign Office, August 20, 1935.
SECRET.MEMORANDUM ON PROBLEMS LIKELY TO ARISE IN THE EVENT OF OUTBREAK OF WAR BETWEEN ITALY AND ABYSSINIA.THE present memorandum is an attempt to comply with the decision of the Cabinet &quot; that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should initiate a. study in the Foreign Office of the problems likely to arise in the event of an outbreak of war between Italy and Abyssinia.&quot;2. It should be pointed out that such a study, if confined to the Foreign Office, is almost bound to be incomplete. A considerable number of questions which arise concern other Departments, either exclusively or at any rate more than the Foreign Office, and as regards these, while the Foreign Office may be able to indicate the nature of the problem,. and possibly to make suggestions in relation to it, it is not in a position to carry out a complete study of it; moreover there may well be questions which might not occur to the Foreign Office at all. While, therefore, it might be possible for the Foreign Office to comply with the Cabinet instructions to &quot;initiate a study&quot; of the problems referred to, it is suggested that a complete study of the subject could only be carried out by some body representing all the Departments concerned, such as a sub-committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence.3. For the purposes of this memorandum it has been assumed that hostilities between Italy and Abyssinia would take the form of a state of war which was generally recognised as such; it is unlikely that the position would resemble that which existed in Manchuria in 1931, where neither party saw fit to treat the situation as constituting a state of war. In that event certain problems which did not arise in the Manchurian case, nor in the case of the hostilities between Bolivia and Paraguay (though in the latter case there was eventually a formal declaration of war), would present themselves and would require to be dealt with.4. In the event of an outbreak of war between Italy and Abyssinia there would be three possible situations : (a) Where there was a decision or general agreement that Italy had violated her Covenant obligations, and article 16 was accordingly applied, against her by this country and other members of the League.(&amp;) Where Italy had not violated those obligations and article 16 was accordingly not applicable.(c) Where, although it might be felt in some quarters that article 16 had become applicable against Italy, no action under that article was in fact taken, owing to uncertainty as to the. facts, lack of unanimity among the members of the League, or any other similar reason.5. For the purposes of this memorandum it seems that alternatives (b) and (c) can be considered together; assuming the general feeling in this country to be that Italy, even if she had not actually violated her Covenant Obligations, was in the wrong, the practical situation under (b) would not differ from that under (c), particularly if, as would appear probable, there was general agreement that whatever the position under the Covenant, Italy had violated her obligations under the Briand-Kellogg Pact.I. Where Article 16 is being applied against Italy.6. For the purposes of this part of this memorandum it is assumed that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and some or all of the other members of the League would be co-operating in the exercise of economic and financial pressure upon Italy under article 16 without having declared themselves to be in a state of war with Italy and consequently, without being in possession of belligerent rights. This memorandum is not concerned with those aspects of 8095   [12015] B
the situation which are understood to be under consideration elsewhere. For present purposes the question which presents itself is that of the powers and machinery which would be necessary to enable His Majesty&apos;s Government to effect &apos;&apos; the severance of all trade or financial relations, the prohibition of all inter-course between their nationals and the nationals of the Covenant-breaking State &quot; which is prescribed by article 16. For this purpose it is assumed that this severance would be complete; if any exceptions to the general prohibition of inter-course were made (presumably by agreement between the members of the League) it should not affect in principle the question of the machinery which would be required.7. On this assumption it would seem that the internal situation which it would be necessary to produce would not differ essentially from that which would automatically result, upon an outbreak of war between this country and another State, from the general prohibition of &quot; trading with the enemy/&apos; Subject to any exceptions which might be made, practically every form of commercial activity by persons or corporations in this country which, if we were at war with Italy, would be illegal under the rules relating to trading with the enemy would require to be prohibited in order to give full effect to article 16.8. The first question which arises is whether fresh legislation would be required in order to give His Majesty&apos;s Government the necessary powers. The position as to this is as follows : In the year 1920 the question arose as to whether His Majesty&apos;s Government actually possessed the legal powers necessary for carrying out their obligations under article 16, and the then Law Officers were asked to advise : &quot; (1) Whether &apos; The Treaty of Peace Act, 1919,&apos; gives power to impose by Order in Council any prohibition on trade and financial relations and intercourse which may be necessary to give effect to article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations.&quot; (2) Whether, in the event of the circumstances contemplated in article 16 of the Covenant arising, this country is automatically placed in a state of war against the Covenant-breaking State in the sense that the common law against trading with the enemy would apply to relations with that State, and that &apos; The Customs (Exportation Prohibition) Act, 1914,&apos; and &apos; The. Customs (Exportation Restriction) Act, 1914,&apos; would therefore become applicable.&quot;The Law Officers&apos; reply was as follows  &quot; (1) In our opinion this question should be answered in the affirmative. The Covenant of the League is part of the Treaty of Peace, and the Act (9 &amp; 10 Geo. V, cap. 33, sec. 1 (i)) empowers His Majesty to make such Orders in Council as appear to him to be necessary for giving effect to any of the provisions of the treaty.&quot; (2) No, we do not think that this country is automatically placed in a state of war against the Covenant-breaking State. Some Act of State, such as a proclamation, is, in our opinion, necessary to place this country in a state of war for legal purposes. But on the issue of a proclamation, or other formal Act of State, declaring that a state of war exists, the common law relating to trading with the enemy and the statutes mentioned would at once become applicable. (No declaration of war is necessary so far as the offending State and other nations are concerned.)&quot;It will be seen that if this country was not to be regarded as being in a state of war with the Covenant-breaking State (the assumption on which this memo-randum proceeds) the Law Officers were of opinion that special powers would be necessary, but that these could be taken by Order in Council under the Treaty of Peace Act, 1919. It should be pointed out, however, that the opinion in question was given fifteen years ago, shortly after the passing of the Act, and that the Orders in Council which were issued under the Act for the purpose, of giving effect to the provisions of the Peace Treaty have now produced their effect and are for practical purposes spent. The question therefore arises whether at the present day it would be an effective and satisfactory method of procedure to take the necessary powers by Order in Council under the Treaty of Peace Act. This question is partly legal and partly political, and in so far as it is a legal one it
would seem desirable to consult the Law Officers again. If, however, it should be thought that, whatever the legal position, it would, for political and parliamentary reasons, be desirable that the necessary powers should be expressly conferred by-Parliament, a reference to the Law Officers would perhaps be unnecessary. It is obviously desirable that this question should be settled some time before the emergency actually arises, especially if Parliament would normally be in recess at the time when the outbreak of war occurred.9. It would probably be convenient that any legislation should take the form of a power to enact the necessary provisions by Order in Council, as was done in the case of a good deal of the emergency legislation during the war. And it would on general grounds be convenient (provided that parliamentary considerations did not render this course inexpedient) if the legislation were not confined to the present emergency, nor to action under article 16, but gave power to enact such provisions as may at any time be necessary in order to enable His Majesty&apos;s Government to co-operate in action taken by the League under any of the articles of the Covenant which deal with the preservation or restoration of peace, such as articles 11, 13 (4) and 16.10. There is one particular point which will have to be dealt with whatever the form of legislation adopted. The severance of commercial relations with Italy will no doubt involve interference with a certain number of existing contracts, but as no state of war would exist between the two countries, the ordinary rules as to the effect of war upon contracts would not apply, and it will be necessary to make special provision for this point. Moreover, it would probably be necessary to regularise the situation ultimately in the arrangements to be made at the end of the hostilities, which are referred to in paragraph 15 below.11. Assuming the necessary powers to have been secured, the question arises as to the manner in which they are to be exercised and the machinery required for doing so. It would seem probable that the machinery laid down in those parts of the War Book which deal with such matters as trading with the enemy, restriction of supplies, control of shipping, control of exports, censorship, control of finance, &amp;c, could be employed or adapted for the purpose. In connexion with the question of censorship may be mentioned the possibility (without infringing com-mercial or other agreements) of a general interruption of all postal correspondence or tele-communication messages with Italy, which, though possibly feasible in this country under the guise of censorship, would probably be more simply effected both in this and other countries by a partial suspension of the postal services under article 28 of the Universal Postal Convention of 1934 and of the tele-communica-tion services under article 27 of the International Tele-Communication Convention of 1932. As regards parcel post, it should be noted that, while a suspension clause is applicable under article 52 of the Parcel Post Arrangement of 1934, to which most countries have acceded, the United Kingdom has not acceded, but has a special agreement with Italy dated August 1930, article 42 of which also contains a suspension clause. These matters are, however, outside the purview of the Foreign, Office, and it is only possible to suggest that they should be examined by the competent authorities.12. The particular question of the control of shipping^1) however, raises some points which, in part at any rate, concern the Foreign Office. It will no doubt be necessary to prevent British ships from trading to or from Italian ports, and presumably no difficulty would arise as to preventing the use of British ports, for purposes of trade with Italy, by the shipping of members of the League who were applying article 16. The question, however, whether similar action could be taken as regards the shipping of non-members of the League or of any members of the League who did not regard article 16 as applicable is a very difficult one; but since the position would depend largely on (a) the attitude&apos;of the States concerned, and (b) any agreements which might be reached at Geneva as to the nature of the action to be taken by the members of the League, it does not seem possible to do more at this stage than call attention to the point. The question of the supply of fuel by British agencies in foreign ports may also require consideration.13. Italian shipping^) would no doubt be prevented from using British ports for any purposes whatever (except in case of damage or stress of weather), but the question of what is to be done with Italian merchantmen which may be(1) Similar questions may arise in connexion with aircraft.
in British ports at the moment when the measures for applying article 16 are put into operation will require consideration. As we should not be at war with Italy, there could be no question of seizing them as prize; it might be possible to detain them during the period of hostilities, but such action might conceivably be regarded by Italy as in the nature of a hostile act. Perhaps, therefore, the best course would be to allow them to depart within a certain period, on the analogy of &quot; days of grace.&quot; In that event, the question whether they should be permitted to depart carrying certain kinds of cargo, such as munitions of war, would require consideration.14. The position under the Foreign Enlistment Act will also require consideration. The provisions of the Act would no doubt be strictly applied in so far as they prohibited assistance to Italy by persons in this country; but in the circumstances it might well be regarded as both unnecessary and undesirable to apply them so as to prohibit any such assistance to Abyssinia. The point is only likely to arise in practice as regards enlistment in the Abyssinian army during the period of hostilities, and, if so, it could be dealt with by the issue of licences (or a general licence) as contemplated in section 4 of the Act.15. Another question which will arise is as to whether Italy is to be regarded as entitled to exercise belligerent rights at sea against British shipping and British goods. Since Abyssinia is a landlocked State, it would seem that the question is only likely to arise in practice in relation to munitions of war or other contraband on their way to Abyssinia and vessels carrying them. It may well be argued that in the case of a war which we regard as illegitimate and involving a violation of the Covenant and the Pact of Paris, it is illogical to recognise that the guilty State is entitled to exercise the ordinary rights of belligerents against the ships of third States and goods carried thereon, and public opinion may well object to acquiescence by His Majesty&apos;s Government in interference with British ships or goods in such circumstances. In practice, however, Italy could only be prevented from taking such action by measures, such as naval protection, which might involve the employment of force. Such action might lead to hostilities and to a declaration of war. In view of this risk, it might therefore be considered better, while reserving our rights to raise the matter subsequently, not to take any action to prevent Italy from exercising belligerent rights, even though this would presumably involve British ships and goods being condemned in Italian courts as prize. It would seem probable that in practice the application of article 16 to Italy would finally have to be terminated at the end of hostilities by arrangements (possibly involving something in the nature of a treaty) between Italy and the members of the League, and it might be possible to deal with the position of ships and goods which had been captured in such circumstances by means of these arrangements. The matter is, however, one as to which it will be necessary to take a decision as soon as hostilities break out, in view of the possibility that the Italian navy would begin to make captures as soon as Italy was in a state of war; moreover, enquiries as to the position by British shipowners, &amp;c, will in all probability have to be dealt with at once.16. Another question which will require to be settled concerns the continuance of diplomatic relations with Italy. This question has been considered to some extent at Geneva, and the view taken seems to have been that, while it would not be possible for diplomatic relations between the Covenant-breaking State and the members of the League who were applying article 16 against her to be continued in their entirety, it might suffice if members of the League were to withdraw the heads of their missions, leaving diplomatic relations to be continued by their subordinates. On the other hand, there may well be a movement for the complete severance of diplomatic relations. It has so far been contemplated at Geneva that consular relations should be maintained. The point is one which ought to be settled by agreement between the members of the League concerned.17. The question of the grant of licences for the export of munitions to the belligerents should not present any difficulties in principle. Obviously, no licences could be issued for supplies to Italy, while in the case of supplies for Abyssinia there would be no reason why licences should not be issued in every case. The question of Italy&apos;s right to intercept sea consignments of munitions on their way to Abyssinia has been considered in paragraph 15 above; it may be added (in view of the fact that Abyssinia possesses no sea ports) that, on the assumption that we would not dispute the exercise of belligerent rights at sea by Italy, we
could not, in view, of our own attitude during the war, object to the capture of munitions destined for Abyssinia which were to be discharged in a non-Abyssinian port. . :    .   :II.  Where Article 16 is not being Applied. ;18. It will be convenient to consider this situation in the first instance on the hypothesis that His Majesty&apos;s Government would act in the way in which before the establishment of the League of Nations they would automatically have acted; that is to say, that they would adopt and proclaim an attitude of strict neutrality and wrould govern their action in accordance with the rules of neutrality as laid down by international law. On this assumption the situation is, in principle, comparatively simple; doubtless difficult questions would arise in the course of hostilities which it is not possible to foresee in advance, but these would have to be solved as they arise in accordance with the rules of neutrality and the precedents which exist. There are, however, certain points which it would be well to consider in advance.19. In previous cases the action taken on the outbreak of war in which His Majesty&apos;s Government determined to adopt an attitude of neutrality has consisted of the issue in the London Gazette of (a) a proclamation of neutrality, and (b) a letter from the Foreign Office to the Admiralty and other Departments laying down the rules to be applied in British ports to belligerent warships. The form 1 of these documents will require consideration.20. A copy of the proclamation issued on the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War in 1911 is attached (Appendix I). This document, which followed earlier precedents, is extremely lengthy and consists largely of quotations from the Foreign Enlistment Act. Its terms are to some extent not altogether suitable to existing conditions, particularly in view of the present status of the Dominions. In 1916, when it was thought that it might be necessary to issue a proclamation of neutrality on the outbreak of war between the United States and Mexico, the Lord Chancellor was consulted as to the advisability of issuing a shorter and simpler form of proclamation, and two alternative drafts were submitted to his lordship. The Lord Chancellor agreed with the desirability of issuing a simplified proclamation and expressed a preference for the shorter of the two forms submitted to him. A copy of the reference to the Lord Chancellor and his reply, with the two drafts in question, is attached (Appendix II).21. This question has recently been the subject of correspondence with the Admiralty, when the Foreign Office expressed the opinion (letter of the 27th August, 1934) that a short proclamation on the lines of that approved in 1916 by the Lord Chancellor &quot; might be considered as sufficient for all purposes and as not presenting the inconvenience which might result from the use of the old form.&quot; While the point will have to be considered in consultation with the Admiralty and any other Departments concerned, it is suggested that this view might well be accepted. The only modification in the 1916 text which would seem to be necessary is the substitution in the penultimate paragraph of the words &quot; all whom it may concern &quot; for &quot; all our loving subjects.&quot; This alteration was agreed with the Dominions Office in 1934; if it is made the wording of the draft seems to present no difficulties from the point of view of the status of the Dominions.22. As regards the second document, a copy of the letter as issued in 1911 is attached (second document in Appendix I). Its terms will require a certain amount of revision; rule 4 is not altogether consistent with the attitude which His Majesty&apos;s Government adopted during the war; the question of submarines may require special consideration; and in some other respects the wording requires to be brought up to date. This revision ought to be undertaken in consultation with the Admiralty and any other Departments concerned in good time.23. It will be necessary to decide on the line to be taken as regards the issue of licences for the export of munitions to belligerents. It is suggested, however, that the obligations of neutrality (which are here assumed to apply) would necessi-tate the adoption of a policy of either granting or refusing all applications which might be made for the supply of munitions to either belligerent. There would be no question as to Italy&apos;s right to intercept at sea consignments of munitions to Abyssinia (see paragraph 15 above), and if the Italian fleet were in a position
to intercept all such shipments, the result in practice would be that Italy could obtain munitions from this country while Abyssinia could not. In fact, our position would be identical with that of the United States during their period of neutrality in the war, when a prohibition of the supply of munitions to belligerents from the United States would, in practice, have operated exclusively to our disadvantage.24. If any consignments of munitions to Abyssinia succeed in reaching British (or French) ports in the neighbouring territories, the question whether their transit should be allowed will arise. The Treaty of 1930, under which there is an obligation to allow such transit provided that the prescribed documents are forthcoming (except in the case where &apos;&apos; the attitude or disturbed condition of Ethiopia constitutes a threat to peace or public order&quot;), does not contain any specific provisions relating to the position in time of war. The treaty is, however (article 16), not to affect any rights or obligations which may arise out of any treaty &apos;&quot; concerning prohibition of import, export or transit of arms or ammunition or implements of war,&quot; Article 8 of the Barcelona &quot;Statute of Freedom of Transit&quot; provides that it does not prescribe the rights and duties of belligerents and neutrals in time of war, but it is to continue in force in time of war so far as such rights and duties permit. Article 7 of The Hague Convention No. 5 on &quot; Neutral Powers and Persons in Land Warfare&quot; provides that a neutral Power is not bound to prevent the transit on behalf of a belligerent of munitions. The position would therefore appear to be that the obligations of neutrality do not require us to prevent transit of munitions to Abyssinia across British territory and (probably) that Abyssinia is entitled under the Treaty of 1930 to call upon us to allow such transit. In that event it may be assumed, however, that Italy would protest, and the matter is in any case one as to which a joint policy with the French would be highly desirable.25. So far the situation has been discussed on the assumption that His Majesty&apos;s Government would adopt and proclaim an attitude of strict neutrality. It is obvious, however, that there may be serious objections to the adoption of such ah attitude. Even though it had not been decided that Italy had violated the Covenant so as to bring article 16 into operation against her, there can be little doubt that she would be generally regarded as having broken the Briand-Kellogg Pact (as well, possibly, as other treaties), and as being engaged in a war of aggression in which public opinion would be strongly against her. It would certainly be held, in some quarters at any rate, that for His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to issue a proclamation which announced their intention of maintaining &apos;&apos; a strict and impartial neutrality &apos;&apos; in the war in question, and to apply the old rules of neutrality, which involved treating each belligerent in exactly the same way quite irrespective of the merits of the quarrel, would be completely inconsistent with the attempts which have been made in the last fifteen years to make war illegitimate. It would be argued that, if the parties to the Kellogg Pact are to treat a country which has gone to war in violation of that instrument as a &quot; legitimate belligerent &apos;&apos; and to apply the rules of neutralitj^ to the country in question, this would render the pact futile, and that for His Majesty&apos;s Government to adopt such an attitude would put an end to any hopes of the United States being induced to co-operate, or at any rate acquiesce, in measures-which the parties to the pact might decide to take against a pact-breaker.26. These are obviously considerations which must be taken into serious account. But it is obvious that His Majesty ^Government cannot, in practice,, avoid the difficulty by doing nothing and abstaining from making any pronounce-ment as to their attitude. It was possible to abstain from any such pronouncement in the case of Manchuria, where neither of the parties wanted to adopt the attitude that a state of war existed, and in the case of Bolivia-Paraguay, where the hostilities were entirely local in an inland territory and no-questions of neutrality arose in practice. But in the present case such questions are bound to arise at once. The treatment of Italian warships in British ports, the position under the Foreign Enlistment Act, the supply of munitions to belligerents and similar matters will inevitably produce problems which it will be impossible to solve unless the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government has been defined. In a case where article 16 is not regarded as applicable but where an attitude of neutrality is not adopted, there are no existing rules which can be applied to problems of this nature. In fact, the modern conception, embodied in the Briand-Kellogg Pact, of the illegitimacy of war has produced a new
situation; in a case where article 16 is applied, that article provides, so far as the members of the League are concerned, the means of dealing with that situation; but in a case where it is not applied, if it is desired to deal with the situation on a basis other than that of the old rules of neutrality, it would be necessary to invent and apply a new set of principles which cannot be said to have any &quot;basis in international law as it has hitherto been understood.27.   The question whether such an attempt should be made is obviously one of the highest importance and difficulty, and is perhaps outside the scope of this memorandum.   Perhaps, however, it may be suggested that it would be possible to adopt an attitude under which, while not taking the active steps against Italy prescribed by article 16, the countries concerned would intimate that they were not prepared, in view of Italy&apos;s violation of the Briand-Kellogg Pact, to regard her as in a state of legitimate belligerency; that they were not prepared to apply the old rules of neutrality to the conflict and would, within certain limits, give or permit assistance to Abyssinia which they would refuse in the case of Italy. This would mean, for instance, that they would deny Italian warships access to their ports; that they would allow the supply of munitions to Abyssinia, but not to Italy; that they would allow their nationals to join the Abyssinian forces but not the Italian; that they would allow Abyssinia, but not Italy, to raise loans in their territories.   Possibly the procedure contemplated in the Convention for Financial Assistance might be applied.    And generally, while not taking any active steps against Italy, they would adopt the principle of doing what they could to impede her operations and assist those of Abyssinia.   One might also argue, although avoiding, as His Majesty&apos;s Government have hitherto done, giving a precise definition of the effect of a breach of the Kellogg Pact or of the measures which in that event the signatories could take, that a signatory State by renouncing the &quot; renunciation of war &quot; as an &quot; instrument of national policy &quot; thereby renounces the right to the &quot; peaceful and friendly relations now existing between their people &quot; and the peoples of other signatory States, and that these States would then be justified in modifying their relations with the former State by adopting measures which, while neither bellicose nor non-neutral, were nevertheless not of a &quot; peaceful or friendly nature.&quot;   Such measures might, for instance, be the interruption of postal and other communication mentioned in paragraph 11, which could in this case be effected not only by States members of the League of Nations, but by all States signatory to the Kellogg Pact (i.e., also the United States, Germany and Japan).   It could, moreover, be effected by a suspension of the various services involved (see paragraph 11), which while amounting to neither a direct restriction of commerce nor a direct prohibition of exports, such as would infringe many commercial treaties (e.g., paragraphs 1 and 3 of the United Kingdom Commercial Treaty with Italy of 1883), would nevertheless (if generally applied) indirectly make trade with the country concerned almost impossible.     It does not seem possible in this memorandum to consider this matter further, nor to discuss the obvious difficulties, political and other, which might arise; but it is plain, in any case, that such action could only in practice&apos;be taken by a considerable number of countries acting in co-operation, and that it would be almost essential that those countries should include at any rate the more important parties to the Briand-Kellogg Pact.   The question whether consultations on these lines could usefully be initiated with these countries, in particular the United States, might perhaps be considered at once.    As far as the United States is concerned, it should be noted in this connexion that at present the President has no authority to impose sanctions except in the limited case of the Chaco dispute, and then only on the strict condition that any measures should be applied equally to both belligerents.   It does not seem at all probable that Congress will give authority of this kind in the case of the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia during this session, owing to the full programme now before them.   (The session is expected to end about the end of this month.)The Position of the Dominions, Colonies, &amp;c.28. This question will obviously require consideration in consultation with the. Dominions Office and Colonial Office. But it would seem that whatever the situation were and whatever the attitude adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, the measures taken would be applied in all the territories for which His Majesty&apos;s Government are internationally responsible, that is to
say the entire British Empire apart from the Dominions. Any action in the Dominions would have to be taken - by His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Dominions, but it would be highly desirable that co-operation between them and His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom should be arranged so far as possible; it may, indeed, be that some of the steps indicated above are such that the Government of the United Kingdom could not take them without being assured of the co-operation of at any rate most of the Dominions.29. It is not thought that the position of mandated territories presents any particular difficulties. Whatever the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government may be, it does not appear that the mandatory system presents any obstacle to its adoption in those territories. In the event of article 16 being applied, that article would no doubt be regarded as overriding the provisions in the A and B mandates under which Italy is entitled to most-favoured-nation treatment, just as it would override the corresponding provisions, in Italian commercial treaties. This point is, however, one for discussion with the Colonial Office, and, possibly,, with the Dominions Office.Egypt and the Anglo-E gyptian Sudan.30. In any of the situations considered above a number of intricate problems will arise in connexion with Egypt and the. Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.31. The population of Egypt contains a number of foreign communities of varying size (of which the Italian and Greek are probably the largest); some enjoy full capitulatory rights, others partial capitulatory rights, and others no rights of this nature. This state of affairs clearly complicates the situations under examination. A further complication is introduced by the fact that some countries enjoying full capitulatory rights are members of the League of Nations, while others are not;(2) some countries with partial capitulatory rights are members of the League of Nations, and other countries neither have capitulatory rights nor are members of the League.32. It should be/noted, too, that especially amongst the large Italian and Greek communities there are a great number of small traders who will be particu-larly anxious to profit by selling material to potential or actual belligerents.33. If article 16 is held to be applicable and is applied against Italy, the -question would immediately arise, owing to the special position of the United. Kingdom in Egypt, what attitude it is desirable that the latter country should adopt. If any action under article 16 is to be fully effective, it seems clearly desirable that Egypt, owing to its geographical position, should also apply the sanctions decided upon. It should, however, be remembered that Egypt is not herself a member of the League and that any measures taken with a view to her participation in such action might encourage her to apply for membership, a contingency which His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to avoid. Jn any case, it only appears to be possible that Egypt should participate in action under article 16 if the United Kingdom is itself doing so. Assuming that the United Kingdom was applying article 16 against Italy, and that it is agreed that Egyptian, participation is desirable and necessary, the question arises how she is to be brought to participate.34. British responsibility in Egyptian foreign relations under the declara-tion of the 28th February, 1922, is of a negative rather than a positive kind. The notification made to the Powers at the time of that declaration warns them against attempted interference in the affairs of Egypt and against any aggression against the territory of Egypt. Article 5 of the abortive Anglo-Egyptian Treaty drafted in 1929 provided, however, that neither party to the contemplated alliance would adopt in any foreign countries an attitude .... which would create difficulty for the other party, and that the parties would not oppose each other&apos;s policy in foreign countries or conclude with a third Power any agreement of a political character which might be prejudicial to the interests of the other party. Article 7 of the 1930 draft treaty provides that, if any dispute with a third State produced a situation involving a risk of rupture with that State, the United Kingdom and Egyptian Governments would consult with each other with a view to a settlement of the said dispute by peaceful means .... Although these articles form part of treaties which were never signed, they may be said to represent the principles of collaboration and assimilation of action &quot;on which His Majesty&apos;s Government act and in which the Egyptian Government acquiesce in respect of Egyptian relations with foreign countries other than the United Kingdom.(2) See Appendix III.
35. Moreover, it is permissible to hope that any Egyptian Government likely to be in power in the near future, and especially the present Government, would be guided, by the wishes of His Majesty5s Government in a matter of this sort; more particularly if they were assured, as they could be assured, that His Majesty&apos;s Government on general principles and under the terms of the declaration of 1922 would protect them against action on the part of foreign Powers who might consider that their interests were adversely affected by Egyptian application against Italy of article 16. In fact, we have reason to believe that King Fuad has expressed the intention of being guided entirely by the advice of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the event of hostilities between Italy and Abyssinia. At the same time it would be quite unsafe to assume that any Egyptian Government would agree, without protest or efforts at resistance, to submit to the imposition by His Majesty&apos;s Government of a course of action or to the adoption by His Majesty&apos;s Government on their part of measures which in Egyptian eyes constituted an infringement of Egyptian sovereignty. If His Majesty&apos;s Government were to attempt such action they would lack the collaboration of the Egyptian authorities (which would be essential), unless this county were to assume in Egypt a degree of control which is probably far from the wishes or the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government.36. On the other hand, it is necessary to remember that the Egyptian Government might be only too pleased to take, in their own name and without the previous consent of the other capitulatory Powers and the Mixed Courts, any action (even if such action were taken on our advice) which would be contrary to the capitulatory rights of foreigners. This is a point which needs consideration. Unless His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to take the opportunity which participation by Egypt in her own name and at His Majesty&apos;s Governments instigation or with their approval would provide of starting a movement for ending the capitulatory regime, it may well be that action on the part of the Egyptian Government to conform with the measures taken by members of the League under article 16 would be undesirable. It is doubtless possible to rule out any opportunist action on His Majesty&apos;s Governments part of the kind referred to above, for, however much they may sympathise with the Egyptian desire to be rid of the Capitulations, it seems hardly possible or desirable that this should be achieved in conjunction with or under cover of action designed for quite a different object. Moreover, when by hypothesis the United Kingdom would be acting with fellow-members of the League (especially France) in a common effort to restore peace and to preserve the principles of the League, it would seem ill-advised, to say the least of it, to risk antagonising her collaborators. When last year a discussion took place regarding the procedure to be followed if it should become necessary to institute a censorship in Egypt in case of an emergency, it was decided that this should not be done by the Egyptian Govern-ment because of the precedent it might create for subsequent action by that Government prejudicial to all foreign rights in Egypt. The conclusion was reached, therefore, that a censorship could only safely be established by a declaration of martial law by the General Officer Commanding the British Troops in Egypt. In the situation discussed in this memorandum the question of the possibility of the proclamation of martial law does not arise, nor even in all probability that of the establishment of a censorship. But, though article 8 of the draft Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1930 provided that the aid of Egypt in the event of war or imminent menace of war would consist in furnishing the United Kingdom on Egyptian territory in accordance with the Egyptian system of administration and legislation all the facilities and assistance in its power and that it would accordingly be for the Egyptian Government to take all the administrative and legislative measures necessary to render these facilities and assistance effective . . . ., there remains the principle adopted in last year&apos;s discussion, namely, that it is undesirable that any action should be taken by the Egyptian Government which could subsequently be used to the prejudice of foreign rights. It may therefore, as suggested above, be decided that it is preferable that Egypt should not take any part in the application of sanctions. On the other hand, it is conceivable that other countries applying article 16 would press His Majesty&apos;s Government, owing to their special position in Egypt, to see that that country did not provide the aggressor country with a means of minimising the effect of the sanctions.[12015] c
,37,-   Assuming, however; j,hat Egypt is applying article i6 in conjunction witii the United Kingdom and other Powers, it is necessary to consider how it would be possible to prevent trading with the aggressor by  (1) Capitulatory Italians in Egypt.(2) Other capitulatory nomEgyptians in Egypt-(a) nationals of League .,   .   members., (&amp;) nationals of Powers not members of the League. , (3) Nomcapitiilatory non-Egyptians in Egypt (a) nationals of Leaguemembers, (b) nationals of States not members of the League. (4) Egyptians.These are complicated legal questions involving a discussion of the capitulatory regime and the functions and position of the Mixed Courts, &amp;c., which it would be impossible to attempt in this memorandum.38.   In this connexion the questions to be solved appear to be :  (1) Whether the Egyptian Government is to be allowed to exert its existing powers or to take the necessary new powers in order to enforce measures in application of article 16; (2) What powers are necessary or legitimate; and(3) How the, consent of foreign countries--(a) capitulatory, and (&amp;) non-capituiatory is tobe obtained, or their resistance overridden,,        ,(4) Whether, oh the other hand,.. His Majesty&apos;s Government should exert their existing powers or take the. necessary new powers for applica-tiori of measures under article 16,and impose them upon Egypt,(5) If so, what are the measures to be taken, and(6) How are His Majesty&apos;s Government to secure the consent .of foreign countries-(a) capitulatory, and (&amp;) non-capitulatory-or to override their resistance, ...  ,H.    ,-.   ,.,;, ,-. i(7) By virtue of what right Plis Majesty&apos;s Government can take these measures and impose them on Egypt.39., As regards the political question whether the Egyptian Government should be allowed to take action to apply article 16 against Italy in Egypt, or whether such action should be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government, it is probably preferable for reasons indicated in paragraph 36 that the action should be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government. The measures to be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government, the question of the nature of the powers necessary for the purpose, and the question whether such powers already exist or would need to be especially taken, these are matters for a legal study which cannot be undertaken in this memorandum. As for the question of the right by virtue of which His Majesfy&apos;s Government could take measures in application of article 16 in Egypt and impose them on Egypt, it is possible that the third of the reserved points (see Appendix IV), i.e., &quot; protection of foreign interests in Egypt and the protection of minorities,&quot; could be stretched to cover action by His Majesty&apos;s Government on the ground that the protection of foreign interests (or at any rate the interests of the majority of foreign countries, i.e.&apos;r-members of the League) demanded that the measures declared by the League should not be impaired by Egyptian action or inaction. But this would be stretching the meaning of the point very far, and it seems necessary that some other, and perhaps more general, justification should be found.40. To take now the state of affairs in which the League decided that article 16 was, not applicable, or no decision on the subject had been taken when hostilities broke out. With this situation can be considered that in which His Majesty&apos;s Government should declare their neutrality in the dispute.41. There seems to be no difficulty in the way of Egypt declaring her neutrality provided that she does so in agreement with His Majesty&apos;s Goverh-ment. The action taken during the war between Italy and Turkey of 1911 will provide useful precedents. In this situation both parties would be free to draw supplies from and float loans in Egypt. The Egyptian Government would be faced with similar problems to those dealt with in an earlier part of this memorandum in respect of the United Kingdom. These problems would, however, be aggravated by the fact of the nationals of foreign countries enjoying special rights and privileges in Egypt. The United Kingdom is likely to be called upon to help Egypt in the enforcement of its rights and obligations as a neutral. Again, /the United Kingdom may be called upon to protect Egypt from any untoward consequences which may flow from her neutral status.
42. Both as a neutral and as a participant in sanctions it is possible that Egypt may become the scene of disputes or riots between, the Italians and other communities if feeling runs very high, Or possibly between the, Italians and Egyptians whether as Copts (whose sympathies would be with their Christian brothers in Abyssinia) or as members of a native African race whose fellow native Africans were being attacked by a European nation. In such conditions the United Kingdom, as protector of foreign interests and minorities in Egypt, might be called upon to intervene in the interests of law and order and security.48. The Anglo-Egyptian Sudan also presents a difficult problem. As subject to the joint sovereignty of the King and of the King of Egypt, the Sudan should presumably participate in any measures under article 16 which the United Kingdom and Egypt were taking. If the United Kingdom were applying article 16, and Egypt were not, it would need to be decided to which of the two countries&apos; attitudes the Sudan should conform, though it is probable that it ought to conform&apos; with that of the United Kingdom, which is charged with the administration of the country.44. Whatever attitude it is decided should be adopted by the Sudan, it will be necessary to consider the question of the powers under which the Governor-General should act, either with a view to applying article 16 or with a view to enforcing neutrality.45. Another question is that presented by the Suez Canal. For the purposes of this memorandum, it is assumed that no question of closing the Canal against Italy arises and the provisions of the Suez Canal Convention would be applied. The matter of the security of the Canal seems to present no difficulty,, since it would be against Italy&apos;s interests to jeopardize its safety, and Abyssinia is unlikely to make the attempt. In any case, this matter has already received consideration by the Committee of Imperial Defence in conjunction with the Foreign Office and other interested Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The High Commissioner is being kept informed of the decisions arrived at and preliminary steps are being taken with a view to the necessary action in case of an emergency.46. The above, it is hoped, is sufficient to indicate the complexity of the situation which would arise in Egypt and in the Sudan in the event of war between Italy and Abyssinia. Its consideration involves much study and clearly calls for consultation with the local British authorities, by whom alone many of these questions can be answered. His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner, the financial and judicial advisers of the Egyptian Government, the Director-General of the European Department of the Ministry of the Interior (whose special duties embrace the protection of foreigners and minorities and the maintenance of order in Egypt) and the Governor-General of the Sudan will all shortly be together in this country on leave of absence. If it is desired that this question should be further studied, a meeting with these officials could be arranged so that advantage may be taken of their opinions and local knowledge and experience, as is essential for the consideration and solution of the problems raised.Foreign Office, August 13, 1935.APPENDIX I.Extract from the London Gazette Extraordinary of October 3, 1911.By the King.

During the continuance of the present state of war, all ships of war of either belligerent are prohibited from making use of any port or roadstead in the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man, or the Channel Islands, or in any of His Majesty&apos;s Colonies or foreign possessions or dependencies, or of any waters subject to the territorial jurisdiction of the British Crown, as a station or place of resort for any warlike purpose, as for the purpose of obtaining any facilities for warlike equipment; and no ship of war of either belligerent shall hereafter be permitted to leave any such port, roadstead, or waters from which any vessel of the other belligerent (whether the same shall be a ship of war or a merchant ship) shall have previously departed until after the expiration of at least twenty-four hours from the departure of such last-mentioned vessel beyond the territorial jurisdiction of His Majesty.Rule 2.-If there is now in any such port, roadstead, or waters subject to the territorial jurisdiction of the British Crown any ship of war of either belligerent, such ship of war shall leave such port, roadstead, or waters within such time not less than tAventy-four hours as shall be reasonable, having regard to all the circum-stances and the condition of such ship as to repairs, provisions, or things necessary for the subsistence of her crew; and if after the date hereof any ship of war of either belligerent shall enter any such port, roadstead, or waters, subject to the territorial jurisdiction of the British Crown, such ship shall depart and put to sea within twenty-four hours after her entrance into any such port, roadstead, or(3) Similar letters to the Treasury, Home Office, Colonial Office, War Office, India Office, Scottish Office and Board of Trade.
waters, except in case of stress of weather, or of her requiring provisions or things necessary for the subsistence of her crew, or repairs; in either of which cases the authorities of the port; or of the nearest port (as the case may be), shall require her to put to sea as soon as possible after the expiration of such period, of twenty-four hours, without permitting her to take in supplies beyond what may be necessary for her immediate use; and no such vessel which may have been allowed to remain within British waters for the purpose of repair shall continue in any such port, roadstead, or waters, for a longer period than twenty-four hours after her necessary repairs shall have been completed. Provided, nevertheless, that in all cases in which there shall be any vessels (whether ships of war or merchant ships) of both the said belligerent parties in the same port, roadstead, or waters within the territorial jurisdiction of His Majesty, there shall be an interval of not less than twenty-four hours between the departure therefrom of any such vessel (whether a ship of war or merchant ship) of the one belligerent, and the subsequent departure therefrom of any ship of war of the other belligerent; and the time hereby limited for the departure of such ships of war respectively shall always, in case of necessity, be extended so far as may be requisite for giving effect to this proviso, but no furthe:. -r otherwise.Rule   3. No   ship   of   war   of  either   bellig- shall  hereafter   be permitted, while in any such port, roadstead, c . waters subject to the territorial jurisdiction of His Majesty, to take in any supplies, except provisions and such other things as may be requisite for the subsistence of her crew, and except so much coal only as may be sufficient to carry such vessel to the nearest port of her own country, or to some nearer named neutral destina-tion, and no coal shall again be supplied to any such ship of war in the same or any other port, roadstead, or waters subject to the territorial jurisdiction of His Majesty, without special permission, until after the expiration of three months from the time when such coal may have been last supplied to her within British waters as aforesaid.Rule 4. Armed ships of either belligerent are interdicted from carrying prizes made by them into the ports, harbours, roadsteads, or waters of the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands, or any of His Majesty&apos;s Colonies or possessions abroad.The Governor or other chief authority of each of His Majesty&apos;s territories or possessions beyond the seas shall forthwith notify and publish the above Rules.I have, &amp;c.E. GREY.APPENDIX II.Reference to Lord Chancellor and Reply-Foreign Office to the Lord Chancellor.Proclama- THE Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to the of Lord Chancellor, and will be greatly obliged if his Lordship will take into his Neutrality: consideration and favour Sir Edward Grey with his opinion upon the question British which arises on the papers enclosed, of the form in which His Majesty should form. proclaim his neutrality in the case arising of a war between two Powers with which he is at peace.The Proclamation which has customarily been issued in such cases in recent years consists, to a large extent, of a recital of some of the provisions of the Foreign Enlistment Act. This Act, in some respects, goes beyond what international law requires of a neutral Power, and it had been decided before the outbreak of the present war to amend its provisions. It therefore appears undesirable, if, as it is thought, it is unnecessary, to quote its provisions at length in a proclamation of neutrality.A letter from the Foreign Office to the Admiralty and to other Government Departments, laying down in great detail the rules to be applied to belligerent ships, has usually been published together with the Proclamation.   The terms of
Rule 4 contained in this letter are now out of date, and it is very undesirable to republish it, as its terms are, in some respects, inconsistent with contentions which have been maintained in connection with the case of the Appam.At a time like the present, when, as experience has shown, it is frequently necessary to re-examine old principles of international law and to consider whether the terms in which they are formulated are fully appropriate to modern conditions, it seems to Sir E. Grey to be highly undesirable to commit His Majesty&apos;s Government in detail beforehand to the literal observance of elaborate rules. In these circumstances it appears sufficient, and indeed preferable, to prepare for issue a short proclamation of neutrality in general terms, and not to publish any regulations which it may subsequently prove necessary to draw up for the guidance of the Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the maintenance of British neutral^.Sir E. Grey has accordingly caused to be prepared two draft forms of proclamation,^) copies of which, together with a copy of the old form of proclamation-mation and letter,(5) are enclosed. He would be glad if the Lord Chancellor would take these drafts into his consideration at the earliest possible moment and would favour Sir Edward with his Lordship&apos;s opinion as to which of them, with or without modification, is most appropriate to its purpose. Sir Edward would himself, on general grounds, prefer the adoption of the shorter form marked (A), if it should appear to his Lordship not less desirable than the longer, marked (B).Foreign Office, June 27, 1916.Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor.The Lord Chancellor has taken into consideration the subject of the com-munication from the Foreign Office of the 27th June, 1916, and desires to state that he is in entire agreement with the view expressed therein as to the desirability of a short and comprehensive declaration of neutrality. In his opinion the declaration contained in the draft marked (A) is sufficient for all immediate purposes. There is plainly no need for an assertion in detail of the duties of a neutral State in a declaration of neutrality, except for the purpose of guiding and advising the inhabitants of that State. In ordinary circumstances such directions might be advisable, but the Lord Chancellor thinks the reasons suggested in the memorandum before him are conclusive in favour of the omission of such details in the present instance.House of Lords, Juwi 28, 1916.Annex (A).WHEREAS a state of war unhappily exists between the United States of America and the United States of Mexico;And whereas we are happily at peace with each of these Powers;And whereas we are firmly purposed and determined to maintain a strict and impartial neutrality in the said state of war unhappily existing between the aforesaid Powers :We therefore have thought fit, by and with the advice of our Privy Council, to issue this, our Royal Proclamation;And we do hereby strictly charge and command all our loving subjects to govern themselves accordingly and to observe a strict neutrality in and during the aforesaid war in accordance with the laws and statutes of the realm in this behalf or the law of nations in relation thereto;And we do hereby further warn all our loving subjects that if any one of them shall do any act in violation of the said laws and statutes or the law of nations he will in no wise obtain any protection from us, but will be liable to the penalties provided by the said laws and statutes, or denounced by the law of nations in that behalf.(4) See Annexes (A.) and (B).(6) See London Gazette (Extraordinary), October 21, 1912 (Confidential, No. 10116*).[12015]
