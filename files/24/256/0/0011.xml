THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1935.SECRET. Copy No. 4 ?CP. 151 (35).CABINET.I CIRCULATE herewith a memorandum by the Minister for League of Nations Affairs on probable procedure at Geneva when the Italo-Abyssinian dispute comes before the Council towards the end of the month.S. H.July 19, 1935.ITALO-ABYSSINIAN DISPUTE. Probable Procedure at Geneva.Present Position.THE technical position at Geneva in regard to the Italo-Abyssinian dispute is as follows :i 2. It was agreed at the meeting of the Council in May last that the Walwal incident and other subsequent incidents of the same kind should be dealt with in accordance with the Italo-Abyssinian Treaty of 1928 by four arbitrators, of whom two were appointed by each party. The Council further decided &quot; to meet-if, in default of agreement between the four arbitrators for the settlement of the dispute, an understanding shall not have been reached by the 25th July between these arbitrators as to the selection of the fifth arbitrator (unless the four arbitrators agree to the extension of this period); the Council also decides to meet to examine the situation if on the 25th August the settlement by means of conciliation and arbitration shall not have taken place.&quot;3. The procedure of arbitration having broken down, it is now inevitable that the Council should meet on or about the 25th July.4. There is already in existence an appeal by Abyssinia under article 15 of the Covenant, which has not been proceeded with in view of the agreement reached during the May session of the Council for dealing with the Walwal incident. This appeal is at present in suspense; but the Abyssinian Govern-ment will certainly revive it, in view of the imminent threat of Italian aggression, when the Council meets towards the end of July. Moreover, when reporting to the Secretary-General the breakdown of the conciliation procedure, the Abyssinian representative drew attention to the extreme urgency of intervention by the Council.Possible Italian Action.5.   In considering the probable procedure at Geneva,  two alternativesituations have to be examined : -(a) Italy may  arraign Abyssinia by way of either  counter-attack orinitiative;(b) Italy may decline to be represented at the Council; or, being represented,may decline to participate in the proceedings. 8049   [11903] &quot; B
(A) If Italy arraigns Abyssinia.6. Italy might have to meet an appeal by Abyssinia to the Council (or Assembly) under article 11; or to the Council (or Assembly) under article 15. The latter is the more probable case. If Italy took the initiative, article 15 would, for reasons which will appear below, offer a more useful procedure for her purpose than article 11.(f) By taking the initiative or counter-attacking, Italy-would recognise the jurisdiction of the Council in respect of the whole dispute; this she has hitherto refused to do.7. During my visit to Rome, Baron Aioisi gave his personal ideas on a possible line of action by Italy at Geneva by way of counter-attack. The object of this move would be for Italy to obtain what she desired in Abyssinia, and for that desire to be satisfied within the framework of the Covenant.8. The counter-attack would be designed to show that Abyssinia was a bad neighbour; had failed to observe her international obligations; and was,.by reason of this and of internal conditions in the country, an unworthy member of the League, and not &quot; an organised people &quot; in the sense of the preamble of the Covenant. (Baron Aioisi did not refer to article 23, by which members of the League undertake, e.g., &quot; to secure just treatment of the native inhabitants of territories under their control,&quot; though this is part of the Italian case.) This situation would constitute a circumstance &quot; affecting international relations which threatens to disturb the good understanding between nations upon which peace depends,&quot; which by article 11 any member of the League is entitled to bring to the attention of the Assembly or of the Council. The situation would also be one of the &quot; international conditions whose continuation might endanger the peace of the world,&quot; the consideration of which may, under article 19, be advised by the Assembly. Further, it would be argued that the provisions of the Covenant for the establishment of the mandatory system were not framed solely to deal with a particular set of circumstances which had arisen as a result of, the Great War, but constitute a doctrine for the future aJso. If a former mandated territory, like Iraq, could become an independent State and a member of the League, could not a member of the League, like Abyssinia, become a mandated territory in conformity with the provisions of the Covenant itself ?9. In these circumstances, the Council might, Baron Aioisi suggested, appoint a committee to recommend a settlement in accordance with the terms of the Covenant, which might give satisfaction to Italy by recommending that Abyssinia should either be made a mandated territory with Italy as mandatory, or subjected to some regime giving Italy a special position.Article 11.10. From the point of view of procedure, no such recommendation could be made by the Council if the matter were before them under article 11, except with Abyssinia&apos;s consent. The Council can make no recommendation, when acting under article 11, involving action by any party to the case, without the consent of all the members of the Council, including all the parties to the case. The chief function of the Council under article 11 is that of mediator.Article 15.11. Under article 15 the situation would be different. When acting under article 15 the Council (if its attempts to settle the dispute by conciliation fail) makes a report and recommends a settlement, either unanimously or by a majority vote. The parties are under no obligation to accept or comply with the report, and failure or refusal to do so is not in itself a breach of the Covenant.12. It would be according to precedent if the Council were to entrust the drafting of the report to a committee of its members. It might also appoint a Commission to conduct an enquiry in Abyssinia, prior to the drafting of the report.13. If the report in the Italo-Abyssinian case was unanimous (apart from the votes of Italy and Abyssinia) and was complied with by Abyssinia and not by(J) For text of relevant articles see Appendix.
Italy, Italy would be under an obligation not to go to war with Abyssinia. If she resorted to war against Abyssinia in violation of this obligation, she would lay herself open to the operation of article 16.14. If the report was unanimous (apart from the votes of Italy ahd Abyssinia) and was not complied with by Abyssinia, Italy could go to war with Abyssinia three months after the report without thereby committing a breach of the Covenant.15. If the report was not unanimous (apart from the votes of Italy and Abyssinia), Italy could go to. war with Abyssinia three months after the report without thereby committing a breach of the Covenant, whether Abyssinia complied with the report or not.16. This is not, however, to say (1) that in so resorting to war, Italy would not be violating the Pact of Paris; or (2) that Italy would be entitled under the Covenant to destroy Abyssinia&apos;s integrity or deprive her of her independence as a result of such war. Such considerations would probably not be a deterrent in Italian eyes.17.   As to the report itself, the probabilities are  (1) It would probably not be difficult for Italy to secure that the report shouldnot be unanimous against her. (2) It is conceivable that a majority report might be produced more or less favourable to Italy. (3) It is most unlikely that she could secure a unanimous report even sub-stantially  favouring any Italian  demand  for  a  mandate  or  aprotectorate.Xotf..- -In counting votes, abstentions from voting are disregarded.   The . :   Council cannot decide upon any matter unless the majority of its. ^members are present.18. Before Abyssinia could become a mandated territory, she would have to cease to be a member of the League. The provision of the Covenant which provided for the expulsion of a member is article 16 (4) which reads: ;..     ; ;   &quot;Any member of the League which has violated the Covenant of the League may be declared to be no longer a member of the League by a vote of the Council, concurred in by the representatives of all the other members - of the League represented thereat.&quot;i 19. Apart from the difficulty of establishing a violation of the Covenant -On the part of Abyssinia, it would almost certainly prove impossible in practice to obtain the required unanimity for the declaration of expulsion. Some members, :of the Council might regard the expulsion of a member of the League as holding a possible precedent for their own case. Others, such as His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, could hardly, I should hope, lend themselves to such a patent manoeuvre in favour of Italy.20. It is thus not necessary to enter into the difficult question of the League body (or the procedure), by which a new mandate could be created and allotted in respect of the territory of an ex-member of the League.21. The same considerations apply to any other solution, e:g., on the model of Morocco, which would involve the relinquishment of League membership by Abyssinia.22. It is, however, just remotely possible that a majority report of the Council, acting under article 15, might recommend the attribution to Italy of wide powers of supervision and collaboration in Abyssinia, not incompatible with the latter &apos;s territorial integrity and independence or with her membership of the League; and that Abyssinia might be constrained to accept such a solution under the threat of a war which might be legitimate under the Covenant, if not under the Kellogg Pact. In view of Italy&apos;s warlike preparations and her apparent intent to commit an aggression against a country whose behaviour before the League has been exemplary since the dispute began, such an outcome is so difficult to conceive as to be virtually ruled out.[11903] &apos; -   - B 2
Article 19. -t ,-        - -  -      &apos;   * . - -23. It would be open to Italy to &quot;invoke article 19 on the plea that the situation of Abyssinia, external and internal, is an&quot; international condition whose continuance &quot;might endanger the peace of the world,&quot; and ask the Assembly to &quot; advise &quot; the &quot; consideration &quot; of this situation. Such an appeal would not produce the rapid results that Italy would require. Article 19 has never been applied. The procedure for its application has not been worked out and the Assembly&apos;s mandate is vaguely expressed, and any debate on the Italo-Abyssinian issue would almost certainly be inconclusive: Italy is much more likely to rely on the spirit of article 19 in putting her case under some other article than to invoke article 19 itself.(B) // Italy declines to be represented, or, being represented, declines toparticipate in the proceedings.; - 24. In this event it would still be open to the Council to proceed with the case under either article 11 or article 15, upon the appeal of Abyssinia.25. Under article 11 the League is entitled to &quot;take any action which may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations &quot; in the.event of a threat of war. Such action, apart from mediation, would normally be frustrated by the adverse vote of one of the parties, in view of the necessity for unanimity. (It is a disputed point whether, if the proposed action is to be taken only by the members of the League other than the parties, the vote of one or both of the parties can prevent such action.) The abstention of Italy would facilitate the making of a recommendation by the Council under this article. It would be legitimate for the Council, under article 11, to recommend to the members of the League, or some of them, the adoption of economic and financial measures against Italy with a view to preventing an outbreak of war. The Council can only recommend, and members of the League are under no obligation to comply with the recommendation. It is, however, unlikely that in existing circumstances the Council would be unanimous in recommending such action. There would almost certainly be members who would think it undesirable.26. Under article 15 parties to a dispute have to communicate to the Secretary-General statements of their case. As, ex hypothesi, the Italians would not do this, the Council would have to proceed as best it could without it. But as the abstention of Italy might in itself be presumed to imply first a disregard of her obligations under the Covenant to submit the dispute to the Council, and, secondly, an intention on her part, already expressed in authoritative Italian quarters, to resort to war, the Council would no doubt recognise that it had a more immediate duty than merely to pursue the procedure laid down in article 15.Possible action by the Council.27. It would be desirable in the first place for the Council to recall the parties to their obligations under the Covenant.28.   The more important of these obligations are :  (a) In the event of a dispute arising likely to lead to a rupture, to submit the matter either to arbitration or judicial settlement, or to enquiry by the Council (article 12).(b) In no case to resort to war until three months after the award by thearbitrators or the judicial decision or the report by the Council (article 12).(c) Not to go to war with any party to a dispute which complies with anarbitral award or the recommendations of a report unanimously agreed to by the members of the Council other than the representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute (articles 13 and 15).29. Other obligations of the parties which might be mentioned in the recital are : &apos;(a) the obligations of the Pact of Paris.(b) the obligations of the Italo-Abyssinian Treaty of 1928, and(c) so far as italy  is concerned, the obligations of the Tripartite Treaty of1906.
30. At the same time, in view of the public statements from the Italian side of a determination to solve the dispute by resort to war, it is important to consider whether members of the Council should declare that, in the event of a resort to war in disregard of the above-mentioned obligations of the Covenant, they would be prepared to fulfil their own obligations under the Covenant (article 16) if others would do the same. ,.   . ( ,Abyssinian request for neutral observers.- -31. On the 19th June the Abyssinian Government proposed to. the members of the Council that the Council should immediately designate neutral observers to go to Abyssinian territory and to inspect the frontier districts marching with Italian Somaliland and the other colonies. The duty of these observers would be to investigate the situation in the frontier districts and to report,to the Council on all incidents real or alleged. The Abyssinian Government supported this request by reference to the despatch of Italian troops and munitions to East Africa; to the threatening language from the Italian side; and to Italian stories of frontier incidents put forward as a pretext.32. The Council has not yet taken this request into consideration, but there is no reason why it should not now do so. The decision to despatch these observers to Abyssinian territory could be taken, if necessary, by a majority.A. E.
APPENDIX.Extracts from the Covenant.. Article 11.1. Any war or threat of war, whether immediately affecting any of the Members of the League or not, is hereby declared a matter of concern to the whole League, and the League shall take any action that may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations. In case any such emergency should arise the Secretary-General shall, on the request of any Member of the League, forthwith summon a meeting of the Council.2. It is also declared to be the friendly right of each Member of the League to bring to the attention of the Assembly or of the Council any circumstance whatever affecting international relations which threatens to disturb inter-national peace or the good understanding between nations upon which peace depends.Article 12.1. The Members of the League agree that if there should arise between them any dispute likely to lead to a rupture, they will submit the matter either to arbitration or judicial settlement or to enquiry by the Council, and they agree in no case to resort to war until-three months after the award by the arbitrators or the judicial decision or the report by the Council.2. In any case under this Article the award of the arbitrators or the judicial decision shall be made within a reasonable time, and the report of the Council shall be made within six months after the submission of the dispute.Article 13.1. The Members of the League agree that whenever any dispute shall arise between them which they recognise to be suitable for submission to arbitration or judicial settlement, and which cannot be satisfactorily settled by diplomacy, they will submit the whole subject-matter to arbitration or judicial settlement.2. Disputes as to the interpretation of a treaty, as to any question of inter-national law, as to the existence of any fact which if established would constitute a breach of any international obligation, or as to the extent and nature of the reparation to be made for any such breach, are declared to be among those which are generally suitable for submission to arbitration or judicial settlement.3. For the consideration of any such dispute, the court to which the case is referred shall be the Permanent Court of International Justice, established in accordance with Article 14, or any tribunal agreed on by the parties to the dispute or stipulated in any convention existing between them.4. The Members of the League agree that they will carry out in full good faith any award or decision that may be rendered, and that they will not resort to war against a Member of the League which complies therewith. In the event of any failure to carry out such an award or decision, the Council shall propose what steps should be taken to give effect thereto.Article 15.1. If there should arise between Members of the League any dispute likely to lead to a rupture, which is not submitted to arbitration or judicial settlement in accordance with Article 13, the Members of the League agree that they will submit the matter to the Council. Any party to the dispute may effect such submission by giving notice of the existence of the dispute to the Secretary-General, who will make all necessary arrangements for a full investigation and consideration thereof.
2. For this purpose the parties to the dispute will communicate to the Secretary-General, as promptly as possible, statements of their case with all the relevant facts and papers, and the Council may forthwith direct the publication thereof.3. The Council shall endeavour to effect a settlement of the dispute, and if such efforts are successful, a statement shall be made public giving such facts and explanations regarding the dispute and the terms of settlement thereof as the Council may deem appropriate.4. If the dispute is not thus settled, the Council either unanimously or by a majority vote shall make and publish a report containing a statement of the facts of the dispute and the recommendations which are deemed just .and proper in regard thereto.5. Any Member of the League represented on the Council may make public a statement of the facts of the dispute and of its conclusions regarding the same.6. If a report by the Council is unanimously agreed to by the members thereof other than the Representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, the Members of the League agree that they will not go to war with any party to the dispute which complies with the recommendations of the report.7. If the Council fails to reach a report which is unanimously agreed to by the members thereof, other than the Representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, the Members of the League reserve to themselves the right to take such action as they shall consider necessary for the maintenance of right and justice.8. If the dispute between the parties is claimed by one of them, and is found by the Council, to arise out of a matter which by international law is solely within the domestic jurisdiction of that party, the Council shall so report, and shall make no recommendation as to its settlement.9. The Council may in any case under this Article refer the dispute to the Assembly. The dispute shall be so referred at the request of either party to the dispute, provided that such request be made within fourteen days after the submission of the dispute to the Council.10. In any case referred to the Assembly, all the provisions of this Article and of Article 12 relating to the action and powers of the Council shall apply to the action and powers of the Assembly, provided that a report made by the Assembly, if concurred in by the Representatives of those Members of the League represented on the Council and of a majority of the other Members of the League, exclusive in each case of the Representatives of the parties to the dispute, shall have the same force as a report by the Council concurred in by all the members thereof other than the Representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute.Article 16.1. Should any Member of the League resort to war in disregard of its covenants under Articles 12, 13 or 15, it shall inpso facto be deemed to have committed an act of war against all other Members of the League, which hereby undertake immediately to subject it to the severance of all trade or financial relations, the prohibition of all intercourse between their nationals and the nationals of the covenant-breaking State, and the prevention of all financial, commercial or personal intercourse between the nationals of the covenant-breaking State and the nationals of any other State, whether a Member of the League or not.2. It shall be the dutjr of the Council in such case to recommend to the several Governments concerned what effective military, naval or air force the Members of the League shall severally contribute to the armed forces to be used to protect the covenants of the League.3. The Members of the League agree, further, that they will mutually support one another in the financial and economic measures which are taken under this Article, in order to minimise the loss and inconvenience resulting from the above measures, and that they will mutually support one another in resisting any special measures aimed at one of their number by the covenant-breaking State, and that they will take the necessary steps to afford passage through their territory to the forces of any of the Members of the League which are co-operating to protect the covenants of the League.
4. Any Member of the League which has violated any covenant of the League may. be declared to be no longer, a Member of the League by a vote of the Council concurred in by the Representatives of all the other Members of the. League represented thereon.Article 19.The Assembly may from time to time advise the reconsideration by Members of the League of treaties which have become inapplicable and the consideration of international conditions whose continuance might endanger the peace of the world.o
