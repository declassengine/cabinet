(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNICMAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).COPY NO.SECRET.CP.  175 .(25) .CABINET. INDIA.Appreciation oi the Political Situation, &quot;by the Government of India,  dated 16th September,  1935.Circulated, for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential Appreciation of the Political Situation in India,  dated the 16th September 1935,  issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.The Government of India Bill has now received-the Royal Assent and the tremendous task of framing the new constitution for India which has occupied constant attention since the Indian Statutory Commission commenced its labours in 1928, has thus been brought to a conclusion. Pat in a sentence,  the Act provides for the establishment of autonomous governments in the Provinces of British India, with certain essential safeguards vested in the Governors, and for the establishment of an All-India Federation of autonomous Provinces and States with a responsible Federal Government, except in the departments of Defence and External Affairs, which are reserved to the control of the Governor-General.    The latter is vested with certain special responsibilities for such matters as (l) the preventionof any grave menace to the peace and tranquillity of India, (2),  the safeguarding of the financial stability and credit of the Federal Government, and (3) the safeguarding of the legitimate Interests of minorities,  etc.The Anglo-Indian press has consistently supported the principles of the reforms, but the Indian-owned press has throughout poured forth a stream of criticism of the Constitutional proposals, claiming that they fall far short of India; ?s demands and fail to give her any real degree of responsibility for her own Government.  This criticism should not he taken at its face value. In the period priorto the passage of the Bill, when the proposals were in the stage of investigation and examination by the Joint Select Committee,  and later when the Bill was in the course of
discussion and amendment by Parliament, the Indian attitude was necessarily influenced greatly by the hope that concessions might be obtained by the continued pressure of Indian opinion,      But, with the measure on the Statute Book, the possibilities of bargaining have disappeared and the attention of public opinion has heen directed by the press in India,  in general,  to the implications of the new constitution,  and to the scope and the purpose    of the impending changes.Comments in the English-owned press and the more rational Indian-owned papers since the passage of the Bill appreciate the fact that the reforms represent a substantial advance over the existing constitution and recognise the extent to which responsibility is to be placed in Indian hands.    There is recognition of the fact that,  in the present condition of India,  the Act represents the only solution to the problem of reconciling legitimate political demands with the responsibilities of providing a workable constitution.The more extreme nationalist press has continued to denounce the measure as reactionary, but its criticism arises rather from fear that the special powers of the Governor-General and the Governors may be brought to the forefront unnecessarily rather than from any conviction that such powers can he dispensed with.    The press as a whole has now passed from the stage of discussing its merits to one of intense interest in the steps which are now being taken to prepare for the inauguration of the hew constitution, and it can fairly be said that&apos; the general trend of opinion is now in favour of working the new c on s t i tut ion.
3.2.    Agitation in connection with, the Lahore mosque dispute tends to increase rather than to die down.    In Lahoreitself little has occurred to cause serious anxiety. &quot;Various committees were formed to press the Muslim claims but these found, difficulty in preparing any plan of action and were at a loss how to proceed.      Their main object was to keep the agitation alive and to reiterate the demand for the restoration of the mosque,  a demand which seems to involve both the handing over of site and the rebuilding of the mosque.      Since the removal of the censorship,  the vernacular Muslim press in Lahore has been very active in publishing articles, the general trend of which has been more anti-Government than anti-Sikh or enti-Hindu.     But the agitation is reported, so fir to have had little effect in the villages as distinct from the towns,  though there is throughout the Province a widespread sense of grievance and also of bewilderment arising from the difficulty of defining what the grievance exactly is.      Though reasonable Muslims recognise that their community had from the first a bad case from the legal point of view, none will admit this in public end there is a very general feeling that in some way or other the Government have let the Muslims down.Muslim    orga isations are becoming more and more deeply committed to demands, which,if insisted on, must lead to a conflict with the Government and the other communities.      These are:- (l)  that the mosque be restored t o  the Mu slims.(2)  that in such casos the Sheriat,  i.e. Muslim law, should prevail over the civil &quot;law.   .  The forthcoming elections are a powerful influence in the whole matter and it appears certain-that the mosque dispute will be made an
4.electioneering slogan.Outside the Punjab, the agitation has been a main if not the sole cause of the raids on villages in the Hazard district by frontier tribesmen.       There have been three such raids, the object of which has been to kill Hindus and destroy non-Muslim places of virorship.      In the North-West Frontier Province itself,  there is the same feeling as in the Punjab that the Government have let the Muslims down, but there have been no local disturbances.In the present month, the agitation has become more dangerous as a result of a conference held in Rawalpindi,  at which resolutions were passed appointing en important Pir (religious leader)&apos;as dictator and proclaiming that civil disobedience should be resorted to from a date to be announced on 20th September, which is to be observed as &quot;Shahidganj day&quot;,  and marked by processions,  speeches, etc. Apart altogether from these resolutions,  the meetings revealed the existence of a group of agitators who will not hesitate to  stir up serious trouble regardless of the consequences..       This new development had such dangerous possibilities that the Government could no longer afford to stand aside.      They have therefore interned the principal agitators to prevent the spread of disaffection in the villages, and they have also taken action against certain vernacular papers which have been fomenting trouble.      This action may possibly cause on outbreak of disorders and bring agitation to a head but the Government regard this as less dangerous than allowing things to drift.3..   There have recently been three manifestations of serious trouble on the North-West Frontier, namely,  in the Mohmand country;in Dir State  (through which runs on
important section of the road to Ghitral where there is a British-Indian garrison); and on the Hazara border. The trouble in Bir has now subsided.The Hazara border trouble,  see paragraph No.2. above, which was entirely due to the sympathy of fanatical tribes-men in this region with the Muslim indignation over the recent Shahidganj affair in Lahore, seems also to have subsided, though it is liable to blaze up again so long as agitation in the Punjab remains alive.The Mohmand trouble, precipitated by the action of the Upper Mohmands in attacking the newly made road in lower Mohmand country under the instigation of a fanatical Mullah,  is more serious.      The immediate threat to the border has been repelled by combined ground and air action, but it has been decided that it is necessary to inflict a lesson on these tribes, which have te,ken the aggressive against British India on en average every other year in the last ten years.Orders have been issued for a column now in the Gandab valley (Lower Mohmand) to proceed to a, suitable point in Upper Mohmand country and to remain, there until the terms of the Government have been accepted by the tribes.      Strong opposition,  swollen probably by considerable; numbers of Afghan subjects,  is anticipated when the column advances over the pass between Upper and Lower Mohmand country.The Italo-Abyssinian question has received considerable attention in the press both in news end editorial columns.      The attitude of the Indian-owned pa/pers is one of unqualified end unanimous condemnation of Italian policy,  and while the English-owned press has put the issue   more dispassionately, it also has condemned the Italian attitude.      The dispute has been referred to as a
frankly racial issue in which the Indian and o non-European races must he on the side of Ahys The feeling is that the League should take a and strong line and assert its authority.
