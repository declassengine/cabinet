Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1935.SECRET Copy No.     44CP. 147 (35).lllllIilllS!l-il : &apos;-CABINET.DISPUTE BETWEEN ITALY AND ABYSSINIA.Subsidiary Questions.Memorandum,&apos; by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a memorandum dealing with certain subsidiary matters arising in connexion with the Abyssinian situation, which may suitably be taken under consideration together.S. H.Foreign Office, July 18, 1935.1. Export of Arms to Abyssinia.A paper on this subject was circulated to the Cabinet on the 8th July, CP. 138 (35). Since that date the Abyssinian Government have addressed representations to His Majesty&apos;s Government as well as to the Governments of Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, France and Sweden, drawing attention to the provisions of the Arms Treaty of 1930. At the same time reference has been made to the refusal of certain foreign Governments to grant export licences for arms to Abyssinia, and the hope has been expressed that His Majesty&apos;s. Government will not refuse to allow such exports.     vWhile a decision on this matter was not immediately essential on the 8th July, it has since become one of urgency, enquiries having been received from certain firms anxious to fulfil Abyssinian orders.The question before the Cabinet is (1) whether we should permit the transit of consignments of arms to Abyssinia through British contiguous territory; (2) whether we should grant licences for the export of arms for Abyssinia from this country.It should be added that orders from Italy are likewise to be expected. It will be appreciated that if licences are issued in respect of consignments for Abyssinia, similar treatment will have to be accorded to applications in respect of Italian Government orders. Similarly, should it be decided to forbid the export of arms to Abyssinia, a similar prohibition would have to be enforced vis-a-vis Italy.2. Applications from Private Persons for Permission to take Service with the,Abyssinian Forces.Only one application of this kind has so far been received by the Foreign Office, but it is anticipated that, in the absence of a peaceful settlement, the Department would be approached by other volunteers. The applicant referred to in the one case which has already arisen is a Mr. E. N. Griffiths, some time an officer in the Royal Air Force, who has it in mind to form the nucleus of an Abyssinian air force with British personnel and British aircraft. In order to get over difficulties connected with the granting of licences under the Ethiopia Arms Treaty of 1930, Mr. Griffiths proposes that his machines should be flown804.8   [11902]
to Egypt and the Sudan under the disguise of a commercial undertaking, proceeding thence to Abyssinia. Mr. Griffiths has been informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot approve his scheme.Whatever decision the Cabinet may reach in regard to the general question of the export of arms from the United Kingdom to Abyssinia, it is strongly recommended that dishonest manoeuvres of the above description should be discouraged.As regards the problem likely to arise through the desire of British subjects to take service in the military forces of either potential belligerent and the bearing thereon of the Foreign Enlistment Act, consultation is taking place in the first instance between the Legal Adviser in the Foreign Office and the Director of Public Prosecutions, and a reference to the Law Officers of the Crown may be necessary in order to establish the precise legal position. At the same time it is recommended that every effort should be made to prevent the enlistment of British subjects under either the Italian or the Ethiopian flag.The presence of British subjects in the rival armies could only give rise to complications which it is to the advantage of His Majesty&apos;s Government to avoid.3. Use of Retired British Army Officers as Police Instructors in Abyssinia.The Abyssinian Government have lately approached His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment with a request for assistance in obtaining the service of retired British officers of the Indian police or Indian army as police instructors in Addis Ababa. They have also enquired whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would see any objection to their recruiting a small number of actual Indian doctors who would organise an Abyssinian army medical service. The Abyssinian Government have been notified that, while no objection is seen to the recruiting of doctors for non-combatant work, His Majesty&apos;s Government are unable to assist in the organisation of the Abyssinian police. The reason for this is that it would be undesirable on all grounds to provide a potentially belligerent Abyssinia with police organisers and instructors at the present time, since it seems possible that in a serious emergency the police might be used to reinforce the military forces, in which case the Italian Government would use the employment of British officers with the Abyssinian police for the purpose of levelling accusations against His Majesty&apos;s Government. There is the further reason that police organisers and instructors fall within the category of foreign advisers, and that it is xindesirable to give Italy a chance of saying that His Majesty&apos;s Government have at this moment attempted to secure the appointment of British subjects for posts of a kind which the Italian Government would like, if possible, to fill with Italian subjects.It is recommended that His Majesty&apos;s Government should adhere strictly to this policy in the event of an outbreak of hostilities.4. Requests from Abyssinia for help from the British Red Cross Society.Sympathy for Abyssinia has led a number of persons to enquire whether His Majesty&apos;s Government have any objection to the despatch of specially recruited British Red Cross units to Abyssinia, or at least to furnishing such units formed in Abyssinia with British personnel and medical supplies. The fact that Abyssinia has not participated in the International Red Cross Convention presents an initial difficulty; and those persons who have communicated with the League of Red Cross Societies, the British Red Cross Society, and the Order of St. John have been notified by these organisations that, unless or until Abyssinia signs and ratifies the Convention, they are precluded by the terms of that instrument from giving her any assistance. The Emperor has been urged to take immediate steps in this direction, but until His Majesty acts (which there is some reason to believe he intends shortly to do) no action on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government is called for.5. Protection of British Subjects in A abyssinia.This problem has been occupying the attention of the Foreign Office for some months, and it was thought that it might be desirable to warn all British subjects
and protected persons to withdraw from Abyssinia before any crisis actually arose, those who remained doing so at their own risk. His Majesty&apos;s Minister in Addis Ababa has expressed the opinion that such a policy would be unsuitable to actual conditions in Abyssinia as well as being politically inadvisable. In this connexion Sir S. Barton has explained that at least half of the British Indian population (which totals 1,200, the white British-protected residents in the capital numbering some 150 souls) would decline to abandon their extensive properties. Among these British Indians must be included the firm of Mohammed Ally, who has been established in Abyssinia for forty years, and whose property and stock in trade^ is valued at  300,000. The Minister feels that to leave firms of this standing, and especially those who, like the Mohammed Allys, have been ultra loyal to Great Britain, without protection would inevitably arouse criticism in India.Sir S. Barton states that the Emperor has issued strict orders to all provincial governors to pay particular attention to the protection of foreigners in the provinces, and that the Emperor therefore sees no reason why His Majesty&apos;s consular officers and volunteers should not remain at their posts. At the same time, the Emperor has been provided with a list of British trading stations with a view to the selection as a preliminary measure of certain main concentration points for refugees in the event of an emergency.Sir S. Barton, who does not consider air evacuation as practicable, suggests that, in order to avoid attempting to rescue or abandoning some thousands of foreigners, the only effective policy would be to make Addis Ababa itself as secure as possible and to concentrate all foreigners there. This, the Minister states, can be achieved by co-operating with the Ethiopian Government for the organisation of police services and by strengthening the Legation guard (which at present consists of a few Indian cavalry and one British officer) by the addition of 100 infantry.I have informed Sir S. Barton that I agree generally with his conclusions. The War Office and India Office are being consulted regarding the reinforcement of the Legation guard, and, as similar action by France would be desirable, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris has been instructed to urge the French Govern-ment to reinforce the guard of their Legation at Addis Ababa in the same way. The Italian Government would be informed of any action eventually taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government in this respect. His Majesty&apos;s Representatives at Brussels and Stockholm are also being instructed that, in the event of the Belgian or Swedish Governments being approached by the Abyssinian Government with a view to the use of their military missions in Abyssinia for the instructions and organisation of a police force, favourable consideration should be given to this request, inasmuch as the assistance of these missions would appear to be in the general foreign interest. It is hoped that the French Government will address similar informal representations to the Belgian and Swedish Governments.As regards British missionaries in Abyssinia, it is proposed to ask the missionary societies with headquarters in London to consider the advisability of instructing their missions in Abyssinia to arrange for the evacuation of all women and children, if this has not already been done, and of concentrating their remaining personnel at Addis Ababa, action being taken in consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Legation and British consular officers.Although there is no reason whatever to doubt the good faith of the Emperor of Ethiopia in his desire, and indeed his determination, to protect foreigners residing in the country, it is not a problem in which His Majesty&apos;s Government can afford to take any risks.Foreign Office, July 18, 1935.
