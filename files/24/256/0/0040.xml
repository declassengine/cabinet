[This document is the Property oi His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1934.SECRET.CP. 180 (35). Copy No............&apos;^ M..CABINET.Government of India Act, 1935.Forecast of Parliamentary Time likely to be required for subsidiary Action towards bringing- the Act into operation.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.I wish to take an early opportunity of warning my colleagues of the considerable demands upon the Parliamentary programme, and in some cases on Parliamentary time, which it seems likely will have to be made between the re-assembly of Parliament and the beginning of the summer recess in 1936. Even then there would be something left over for the autumn of 1936 and early spring of 1937.My colleagues will remember that the Act provides for a veiy large number of matters of detail to be prescribed by Order in Council, and further provides that the drafts of all such Orders in Council are to be submitted for approval to both Houses of Parliament. This procedure applies inter alia to the fixing of the date for the coming into operation of Part III of the Act, in other words the commence-ment of &quot; Provincial Autonomy.&quot; The Act further provides for the approval by both Houses of Parliament in draft of the Instruments of Instructions to be issued by the Crown to the Governors.I attach to this Memorandum a list of the provisions of the Act which necessitate approval by both Houses of Parliament to the action which will have to be taken in anticipation of, or for the purpose of, bringing Part III of the Act into operation; but I should explain that this list does not include the corresponding provisions relating to Burma. In nearly every case there is a corresponding Burma provision, but I anticipate that it would be convenient and possible to submit to Parliament simultaneously the Indian and Burma Orders in Council on any particular matter.So far as the Parliamentary time-table is concerned, the governing factor will, of course, be the date decided upon for the coming into being of the new Provincial Governments and Legislatures, including the effective separation of Burma. I am working on the assumption, as had been my predecessor before me, that the date to be selected will be, if financial conditions are such as to make this feasible, either 1st January 1937 or 1st April 1937, the choice between these two dates being determined in the main by practical considerations of administrative convenience. It will be necessary in the course of the subsidiary proceedings in Parliament to secure the formal approval of both Houses of Parliament to a draft Order in Council fixing one or other of these dates ; but I do not anticipate that it will be possible to place this proposition before Parliament until I have received, and have made available, the report of the expert financial enquiry which is to be held in India during the ensuing cold weather, in other words not probably until about April next. But, on the assumption that Provincial Autonomy is to start some time early in 1937, there are certain items ia the programme which are of some urgency ; in particular, we ought if possible to get approved and promulgated before Christmas the Order or Orders in Council under section 289 setting up Sind and Orissa as separate Provinces with the necessary provision for their temporary administration until Provincial Autonomy starts, since I hope that these Orders in Council may take effect from 1st April 1936. It is essential, if great administrative inconvenience and confusion are to be avoided, that these two Provinces should be in being as separate entities as soon as possible before the commencement of Provincial Autonomy. Further, we are pledged by the terms of the Act itself to present to Parliament the draft Order in Council enumerating the areas to be treated as Excluded and Partially Excluded under section 91 not later than 2nd February 1936, though it will not be necessary to obtain approval to this draft immediately.   Another matter which will, of course, be urgent will be the detailed4093      65   9.35
electoral Orders in Council for the neAV Provincial Legislatures.; these ought to be debated and passed as soon as possible after I have received the report of the Delimitation Committee which is now about to begin its task in India. These also I hope to have ready about April next; until these electoral Orders are made no progress can be made with the final preparation of the electoral rolls.Apart from these more urgent items, the position seems to me to be always assuming again the commencement of Provincial Autonomy early in 1937 that we shall probably have to aim at securing the approval of Parliament to the whole of the rest of the matters indicated in the attached list, and of the corresponding requirements for Burma, before the summer adjournment of Parliament in 1936. It might be possible to postpone some small part of them to an autumn session in 1936 ; but to what extent this might prove possible would depend very largely on whether 1st January or 1st April 1937 was selected as the date of the commence-ment of Part III.I cannot, of course, estimate the extent to which these matters will give rise to debate and consequently I cannot estimate at all accurately the amount of time likely to be required.    In any event  it seems  probable that there will  be considerable debate on at least the following matters :  The Order in Council for Sind and Orissa; The Order in Council for Excluded Areas ;The electoral Order in Council for the Provincial Legislatures ;The Burma Trade Agreement;The Governors&apos; Instruments of Instructions ; andThe fixing of the date of the commencement of Part III.The last item, whenever it occurs, will, as I have already indicated, involve a debate on the report of the expert financial enquiry. It is apparent, therefore, that the demands upon Parliamentary time between, say, 1st November 1935 and the end of July 1936, are likely to be considerable. In addition I shall have to ask time for the passage of the Bill, regarding which I have submitted proposals separately to my colleagues, for the purpose of reprinting the Act in two parts, and it will also be necessary before July 1936 to secure the passage, with reference to section 315 of the Government of India Act, of a new East India Loans Act.Z.India Office, 24th September 1935.
