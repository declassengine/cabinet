Be ems lit tls p3?ssp$et of Italians accepting yesterday&apos;a suggestion, end French share our pessimism in this respect.   Lf we get a negative answer from Rome today we shall compulsory Italians that it is now their turn to make proposals and that these must necessarily be very different from those made to me in Rome by Signor Mussolini.   We shall add that we ourselves have little else to suggest and that we went to the maximum at once in view of shortness of time ahead of us.   Monsieur Laval.has.already sent a message to Signer Mussolini in this sense.We are unwilling however to wait for more than a day or two for any fresh Italian suggestion that may be forthcomings,   Wa have not lost all hope of a solution; Out we both have a suspicion that Italians, on present form, may be: merely playing for time and preparing to spring action early -next months   We are ready to wait until early next ws-ek-;   but if Italians mean business they will have had plenty of time to produce- a co^jntar-suggestion by then,end

They have ind-esd already said several times that they maintain int^rslly the position explained to me in Horns *   Monslsur Laval takes a rather more unpromising view of the situation than we do *2C   Eefusal is more than likely to entail a breakdown of negotiationse though we shall be reedy to keep them alive for a few more days with a view to eliciting some Italian counter-proposition.   There is little further that ws could suggest ourselveSo   The. Italians maintain a completely contemptous view of the possibility of a cession of Ogade-n*3.   If the worst comes to the worst, the French seem likely to be prepared for a stiff&quot; time at Geneva^ though of this we cannot yet be surso
304.     Time is setting short, and, in the circumstances above described we feel it may well he both prudent and important to review and to prepare, not later than next week, some at least of the precautionary measures that have already been discussed.5e    We will report further on all these points, so soon as we receive the impending answer from   Rome8     For with that answer we shall receive further, and possibly conclusive, enlightenment on both the Italian andFrench attitudes.6.     It will then be possible to fix the date for ,the clearly essential meeting of the cabinet a     It seems unlikely that it could &quot;be later than the 27 th..     Indeed you may consider it necessary to ask for it earlier0You will see we have addressed this to you personally but you may think it well to circulate it to your colleagues with last report of chiefs of staff.We feel also that chiefs of staff should see this telegram.     You will recollect that we undertook to keep them informed, so soon as we had any information or indication bearing on the points in which they are Involved.
