Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1935.SECRET:......Q.P. 168 .(36).CABINET.ITALO-ETHIOPIAN DISPUTE.. Note by the Secretary of State for Dominion A ffairs.WITH the agreement of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, I circulate to my colleagues herewith a copy of a letter which I sent to him on the 15th August, on various points which affect the Dominions arising from the Report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on the Italo-Ethiopian dispute now circulated in CP. 166 (35).J. H. T.Dominions Office, August 20, 1935.(Most Secret.)Dear Secretary of State, Dominions Office, August 15, 1935.Some very important points affecting the Dominions arise in connection with the Report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on the Italo-Abyssinian Dispute (CCS. 392) to which I think that I ought to draw your attention immediately.The Report itself, and still more the Report by the Joint Planning Sub-Committee, clearly contemplate that a state of war with Italy might arise, and appear to envisage that, in certain circumstances, the Naval Powers might find it necessary to take the initiative by declaring themselves to be in a state of war with Italy.As you know, it was laid down at the Imperial Conference of 1926, and their conclusion was repeated by the Imperial Conference of 1930, that&quot;None of His Majesty&apos;s Governments can take any steps which might involve other Governments of His Majesty in any active obligations without their definite assent.&quot;This dictum has been consistently acted upon since, and the highest importance is attached to it by the Dominions.Obviously, if there must be a war with Italy (which Heaven forbid), not only would Dominion Governments be involved in active obligations in theory, but the circumstances would almost inevitably call for the active participation of most of them in practice. Clearly, therefore, a declaration of war would not be a matter for the United Kingdom Government alone, but would be one on which the King should be advised by all his Governments.I am bound to say that, in my view, and I expect that you will agree, there could not fail to be very great difficulty in securing the agreement of all the Dominion Governments to a specific declaration of war; any attempt to secure agreement, however great the Dominions&apos; sympathy with the underlying policy involved might be, would inevitably, I believe, lead to endless discussion, and it might well precipitate the very gravest inter-Imperial difficulties.Copy No.
Hence it seems to me essential to look for some alternative, and I feel that the only possible way out would be if Italy were declared, under Article 16 of the; Covenant of the League, to have resorted to war in disregard of her Covenants, in which case she would be regarded as having, ipso facto, committed an act of war against all other members of the League. Thus it would be Italy which had forced all His Majesty&apos;s Governments into war, and the consequential obligations.A further question which arises in connection with the Chiefs of Staff Report is the necessity of informing the Dominions of any decisions which the Government here may take in the way of defence preparations. In particular, if it should prove necessary to contemplate diverting British shipping from the Mediterranean to the Cape route, the active co-operation of the Union Govern-ment would certainly be required, and it would be necessary to take them fully into our confidence and assure ourselves that their assistance would be forthcoming.I am sorry to add to your worries, but I am sure that you will realise that I have no alternative but to raise these very important points.I am sending a copy of this letter to Ramsay MacDonald, and am taking steps to let the acting Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence know of the constitutional considerations involved as indicated above. I will defer any further action until I hear from you.Yours sincerely, (Signed) J. H. THOMAS.The Right Hon. Sir Samuel Hoare, Bt., G:G.S.L, G.B.E., C.M.G., M.P.
