PEEFATOBY NOTE.BEPOEE entering upon a detailed statement of the Goyern-menfs views on Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s proposals, it will be convenient to place on record a brief account of the events which led up to his recent discussions with a Committee of the Cabinet.The main lines of Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s plan were explained to the public in a series of speeches. The first was delivered at Bangor on the 17th January, and, speaking at Belfast on the following day, the Chancellor of the Exchequer referred to the proposals and said that, when completed, they would be examined with an open mind by the Government.In the course of an article published in the Press on the 1st March, Mr. Lloyd George wrote that he had sketched out schemes of productive work which would give employment to large numbers of workless people. He had worked out the details, including estimates of the numbers that would be employed and of the capital expendi-ture involved. He added that the Government had promised a careful inquiry into his proposals, but that so far he had not been asked to submit his plans or figures to the Cabinet. He declared himself ready to appear before any &apos;&apos; authentic committee &apos;&apos; which might be set up to investigate possibilities and&quot;proposals.On the same day the late Prime Minister, Mr. MacDonald, invited Mr. Lloyd George to send him these estimates and calcula-tionis, saying that they would be considered immediately and care-fully by the Cabinet. He explained that the Government were at that time engaged in considering certain proposals of a like character, but would welcome further suggestions.On the 14th March Mr. Lloyd George transmitted to the late Prime Minister a lengthy note, entitled &quot; Plans submitted by the Eight Hon. D. Lloyd George, O.M., M.P., for utilising the depression to reorganise and develop our national resources and to improve national conditions.&quot; This was at once placed in the hands of an existing Committee of the late Cabinet for examination and discussion with its author in person.A first perusal of this document, which occupied more than 40 foolscap pages of print, showed that it covered a wide field, but that it by no means bore out Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s description of it in his published article. Instead of detailed plans, the Committee found broad generalisations upon various spheres of policy; estimates of the numbers that would be employed, where given, appeared to be based in considerable measure on hopeful prophecies, while the capital expenditure likely to be incurred was stated with precision only for a minority of the suggestions.The suggestions themselves were largely unrelated to one another and it was obvious that, if they were to be properly analysed, they must be treated separately. Accordingly, the Committee suggested and Mr. Lloyd George agreed that the paper should be discussed with him under the following heads, in the order in which they are placed : 1. Preliminary.2. Agriculture, including land drainage and land settlement.3. roads, railways and electrification.4. Housing and town planning.5. Industrial organisation.6. Overseas trade.7. School age, retiring pensions and shorter hours.8. Finance.9. Machinery, the National Development Board and the Super Cabinet.[11899]
As the discussions proceeded it became apparent to the Committee that the core of the proposals was to be found in the section dealing with agriculture. Evidently Mr. Lloyd George has given his close personal attention to the subject. Not only are the agricultural proposals discussed at much greater length and in more detail than any others, but it is to agriculture that he turns with greatest hope and confidence to solve the problem of the unemployed. It was therefore with very special interest that the Committee considered these proposals.Following upon the discussions, Mr. Lloyd George has modified and revised his original document, and the statement of the Government&apos;s views which is here set out in detail was prepared for and approved by the Cabinet after the Committee had examined the final form of his proposals now made public.
SECTION I. PRELIMINARY DISCUSSION ON general principles.Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s ultimate purpose does not differ from that of the Government. The question is whether his methods are. well-conceived. His scheme consists of a large number of distinct proposals, many of which involve far-reaching changes in our economic, social and political system. Each needs to be weighed before the effect of the ivhole can be judged, and each must be judged in relation to conditions actually prevailing. Recently this country was in the throes of the greatest economic collapse of modern history. To-day under the National Government it is steadily recovering. The question is whether the proposals made can contribute effectively to the pace of recovery in its present phase or whether they might not in certain instances at any rate actually affect adversely the progress that has already been attained. Finance need be no obstacle to any sound and solid scheme.1. The Plans to adopt the name originally given by Mr. Lloyd George to his proposals do not constitute a single interrelated scheme, but they are prefaced by a general statement of their aim and by a general diagnosis of present economic conditions.2. Their aim is set forth in their first title : it is to reorganise and develop our national resources and to improve our national conditions. &apos; That, needless to say, is the aim also of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Government further agree that it is sound policy to &apos;&apos; utilise the depression&apos;&apos; for this purpose of reorganisation, development and improvement. It is elementary wisdom to use a period of economic change and disturbance for the purpose of preparing for the future, whether the disturbance is regarded as a temporary interruption of normal conditions or as a transition to new conditions. The general purpose of the Plans is thus the general purpose of the Government.3. Further, this agreed statement of general purpose implies agreement also on certain main principles of action. The resources of a nation are developed primarily by the skill and initiative of its citizens, by the enterprise they exhibit and the confidence they command, by their success in scientific research and invention, and by the wisdom and energy of its Government. The conditions of a nation&apos;s life are improved mainly by the same means : by the co-operative effort of private individuals, by the continuous and little-noticed activities of local authorities, and by the directing influence of the central Government. The Government can at all times give impetus to national progress, but in doing so it must be wary of any action which might retard the progress of the nation as a whole by discouraging individual and local effort. In so far as the Government undertakes functions which are the ordinary concern of public bodies or of private enterprise, it must be reasonably sure that its new effort will add to the common stock. These are the acknowledged limitations of a Governments freedom in formulating policy. If in this country Governments are sometimes suspected of being too conscious of these limitations, it is certain that the failure of many experiments initiated by the Governments of other States since 1931 has been largely due to a disregard of them; and it remains true that no great country can claim to have advanced so far as our own upon the path towards renewed prosperity.4. The general diagnosis of present economic conditions on which the Plans are professedly based is two-fold : unemployment to-day is attributed largely to the loss of external trade and to the growth of mechanical substitutes for human labour.   This diagnosis
is obviously not exhaustive, and it runs the risk of obscuring the actual situation with which the Government of this country has had to deal, and still has to deal. It might serve as a partial explana-tion of our difficulties in the ten years immediately succeeding the Armistice, but it virtually ignores the fact that the history of the last six years has been the history of a crisis within a crisis.5. This inner crisis began in the autumn of 1929 with the Wall Street collapse. A depression of unparalleled intensity then swept over the world, and this country, as a pivotal centre of international trade and credit, with its vast shipping interests and its extensive overseas investments, was peculiarly exposed to the cumulative impact of that depression. Export trades already flagging quickly declined. The balance of our imports and exports, overseas went heavily against us. Internally, too, this country was suffering in 1931 from unbalanced finances and from lack of confidence; our prestige m foreign eyes was gravely impaired. Falling markets and failing prices sapped activity. In the end our economy cracked under the strain. In September of that year, the figures of the live register showed nearly three million men and women workless. Through distrust abroad of our recuperative power the pound was driven off gold.6. Clearly, the displacement of human labour by the machine offers no explanation of this collapse, and our loss of external trade was a,consequence of the conditions prevailing abroad. Other countries, including some of our most important customers, lost much of their power to buy. This loss of power was expressed in a growing net-work of restrictive regulations which had little in common with the protectionist policies of the preceding ten years. They were panic measures which already in 1981 were drying up the streams of our external trade, and have since grown steadily more elaborate and more intense.7. These were the conditions that the present Government inherited. Inheriting them, the Government have had, and still have, a triple task. They must restore shattered confidence; they must develop the home market; they must secure what openings they can for our export trade in overseas markets, while preparing the nation to take quick advantage of an eventual revival of international trade and to re-assume the historic part which our people have played in the commercial world, as a great exporting community.8. It is important to emphasise the significance of this third task, for though loss of external trade occupies a large place in Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s diagnosis, a revival of external trade is given only a comparatively minor place in his Plans.9. Much has changed since the war. In the new era on which we seem to be now entering, the world may never recover that freedom of international exchange which was the characteristic of the nineteenth century. In the future our overseas markets may well lie rather in the countries of the Empire and in other countries now closely associated with us in trade. But whatever changes we may thus have to face, stubborn facts deny that this country can maintain a full standard of life if it is insulated against trade contacts with countries overseas. In this small and densely populated island we can never grow all the food we need, and we lack m&apos;any of the raw materials for our industries. A country thus bound to import must export correspondingly. We have grown great as a nation manu-facturing finished goods for export, and many of our people have migrated into the distant countries of the Empire, where they are producing the commodities we need in exchange for others which we can best supply. By our seafaring character we have become the great sea-carrying nation. By our credit we have become the chief money centre and the chief trading mart of the world. No solution of our problems can be found in a,nj effort to make ourselves narrowly self-supporting.
10. As the policy of the present Government has been directed towards three great tasks, so it has had three main phases. In the first phase, up to the mid-summer of 1932, the worst ravages of the crisis were repaired. At the. cost of severe sacrifices, borne by all sections of the community, the finances of the nation were solidly restored. By tariffs, home industry was rendered secure and capable of expansion, and imports and exports were brought to a true relation; the excessive flow of money abroad was checked, The foundations were laid for a system of cheap and plentiful money, as an essential impetus to reviving trade. Confidence was re-established. Foreign observers, who had a few months previously thought that they could observe in a once great country the symptoms of final decay, discovered that, first among the leading nations, that country had found itself again.11. The second phase, for which the first was a preparation, was inaugurated by the great Conversions, headed by the Conversion of the War Loan in July 1932. Cheap money to finance the short-term needs of business had already been established. By these operations it was rendered even cheaper. The rate of interest on long-term borrowings for business purposes was brought instantly down. Thus enterprises previously unprofitable became lucrative; as a single instance, a new era in the development of housing enterprise was opened up. Production increased first, the production of capital goods, then the production of goods for the ordinary consumer&apos;s needs. Employment rose; depressed trades returned to the dividend list and engaged more wage-earners, and as quickening enterprise increased the general purchasing power, the community took new hope.12. At the same time, the Ottawa Agreements and commercial agreements negotiated with foreign countries opened new avenues of overseas trade. The index of production in manufacturing industries which, in 1932, stood at 97-2 as compared with 100 for 1924, rose in 1934 to the record figure of 117-4. The excess of exports over imports of wholly or mainly manufactured goods, which was  48 millions in 1931, rose to  130 millions in 1932, to  142 millions in 1933 and to  144 millions in 1934. The resulting improvement in the yield of national taxation led directly in the spring of 1934 to the remission of the main part of the burdens imposed three years before. Some 850,000 more men and women had by that time been absorbed into employment.13. In the third phase, the phase in which we are now working, it has been the business of the Government both to consolidate and to extend the progress thus achieved. No single outstanding measure, such as the Conversion scheme, holds the stage, but important measures for the encouragement of reorganisation in industry and agriculture have been taken, the remainder of the special burdens imposed on the citizen during the crisis have been substantially remitted, and the employment figures show that at no time in our history have so many people been at work as are at work to-day.14. This brief survey gives but a bare indication of the main trend of Government policy. Other features of that policy will be mentioned in the following pages. The results achieved certainly afford no ground for self-complacency. Very much still remains to be done far less, indeed, than in other countries, but still very much. In the present phase of our policy, progress is admittedly slower and more arduous than in the first rebound from crisis conditions. To some extent, this is inevitable; the world has not yet emerged from the intensified crisis of the past six years, and we have reached the point where the pace of our further national recovery must to some extent be set by the advance&apos; of other nations in the same direction. But we may, by stimulating or assisting development and expansion through the agency of the Government, do something at least temporarily to accelerate our rate of progress.15. And, for this purpose, we enjoy one advantage in particular resulting from our past policy. Money is plentiful. There is an ample supply available to be borrowed, whether on short term or long,
both for the increasing requirements of normal business and for any reasonable programme of public enterprises. The Plans under examination, in their anxiety to prove that money is plentiful, use arguments some of which do not seem to the Government to be well conceived. In particular the proposal to raise a loan of the magnitude envisaged in advance of the time when it would require to be spent would involve serious financial dislocation and would be deflationary in effect. That, however, is little more than a side issue. It is certain that to-day finance need be no obstacle to any sound and solid scheme.
SECTION II. EFFECT OF THE PLANS ON UNEMPLOYMENT.The Plans, it is claimed, would bring unemployment substan-tially and promptly to an end. This claim seems, however, to be entirely out of relation to the actual proposals submitted.16. Before proceeding to consider the Plans in detail, there is one other general question which requires careful analysis. The Plans have a further aim beyond those stated in their title; or at least they make a further claim. It is asserted that they would substantially abolish unemployment, and Mr. Lloyd George has put it on record that this result could be achieved in some fifteen months.17. So far as concerns the more distant future, Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s hope seems clearly to be that the general improvement in our economic organisation resulting from the adoption of the Plans, and especially of the agricultural proposals, will of itself, without the intervention of State activities or the use of public funds on any abnormal scale, correct the difficulties experienced to-day and reduce unemployment to small dimensions. It is, of course, the case in this country as in others that the times through which we are passing are abnormal, and the Government, like Mr. Lloyd George, have no doubt that with the continuance of wise administration the old time prosperity of this country will return. But the question how far the Plans would contribute to this more distant object &quot;depends upon the wisdom of the Plans themselves, and as this note proceeds the view of the Government upon that matter will become clear.18. Meanwhile, the immediate question is whether the Plans would commence to reduce unemployment from the moment of their adoption and eliminate it almost at once. The importance of this question needs no emphasis. Many and various as are the experi-ments made in other leading countries to combat the effects of the economic catastrophe of 1931, not one has fulfilled such claims as this, and, indeed, not one has attained such results as those gained by the Government by sound and well-tried means.19. The precise manner in which Mr. Lloyd George expects that unemployment will be swiftly absorbed cannot be deduced with any confidence from his document. The explanation which he subse-quently gave to the Cabinet Committee, or perhaps more strictly the record of that explanation as amended at his instance, still seems to contain ambiguities, and therefore leaves the Government in some doubt.   But the following is understood to be his general view.20. Mr. Lloyd George correctly points out that the unemployed are a changing body; only the minority of the numbers on the register at any time are subject to periods of long-term unemploy-ment; the majority are workers who pass through a short period of unemployment during the course of any year. The problem for solution is not that of finding constant work for 2,100,000 persons  the figure which Mr. Lloyd George takes as the constant figure of unemployment but might be more correctly stated as that of finding work to be taken up by different workers at different times, but sufficient in volume to provide the equivalent of constant employment for the number of workers named.21. In the Plans, so it is understood, the constant figure of 2,100,000 is reduced to 1,550,000 by leaving out 250,000 workers looked upon as unemployable, and 300,000 who would, it is claimed, be eliminated from the labour market by raising the school-leaving age and providing training facilities. Work sufficient to give constant employment to some 550,000 workers would, it is suggested, be directly provided by expenditure on various public works which Mr. Lloyd George would set on foot at once, while the additional work created in other industries as the direct result of this programme, i.e., by the orders placed for materials and the necessary transport, &amp;c, would create full work in their own trades for workers now from time to time unemployed equivalent to the full employment throughout the year of roughly a further 500,000 workers. Finally, the general infusion of confidence and enterprise which Mr. Lloyd George assumes the adoption of his programme would produce would give full employ-[11899] c
ment in their own trades for all other workers now from time to time unemployed, this being the equivalent of work throughout the year for the 500,000 workers who remain on the register after the deductions which have already been made.22. All such estimates must be highly speculative, and the Government doubt whether any particular measure or policy can be justified by such speculations. For instance, the Government&apos;s views as to the raising of the school-leaving age are to a considerable extent in agreement with those of Mr. Lloyd George, but the justi-fication for that policy must be sought in its effect on the character and on the future life of the children thus retained in school, rather than in any guess as to its immediate effect on the amount of employment available to adults. In the years before 1933 there was actually a large decline in the number of juveniles leaving elementary schools, and a considerable increase in the number of older students at secondary schools. No doubt this decline in the amount of available juvenile labour produced some effect on adult employment, but few would be prepared to hazard a quantitative estimate of that effect, and certainly none would place it nearly as high as the figure estimated by Mr. Lloyd George.23. Similar considerations apply to the suggestion that expendi-ture upon public works should be embarked upon on a scale sufficient to give employment partly directly and partly on materials, transport, &amp;c., equivalent to the continuous work of over one million workers. There are no details and no estimates in the plans, but Mr. Lloyd George suggests that it should be possible to produce a sweeping scheme for the construction and improvement of roads, plans for electrification of railways, for reclamation and drainage of huge areas of land and for other works.24. The intrinsic desirability of these public works will be discussed later. For the moment the Government are concerned only to say that in their view the net employment value of these schemes would prove small and slow in coming. Their effect would be all the slower for the new machinery proposed by Mr. Lloyd George.25. Mr. Lloyd George proposes that these works should be undertaken not by the Government of the country as ordinarily understood, nor by local authorities in whose sphere they primarily fall, but under the auspices of a new organ of Government, the National Development Board. If the country is to have a new organ of Government, the respective functions of that body and of older and more established institutions must be decided. Their spheres must be marked out and interlaced on intelligible business lines. The settlement of these essential preliminaries clearly involves delay.26. Apart from this it seems to the Government to be a mis-conception to suppose that a vast quantity of hitherto undiscovered work capable of giving employment to large numbers of people lies waiting to be put in hand. In the fifteen years since 1920, some . 1,200 million has been spent upon State aided or State executed public works of various kinds, and so much has been done that for a long time past good schemes which can quickly be put in hand have been hard to find. Further schemes will from time to time be found, such as those referred to in Section VIII on Public Works, and the Government are constantly endeavouring to discover them and promote their adoption; but the possibilities in this direction are not unlimited, nor can such schemes be hurriedly undertaken. The rule which applies to ordinary business developments on a great scale applies equally to State aided public works. Careful and deliberate planning and preparation are the only preventatives of waste or even failure.27. Moreover, past experience shows that, once it is seen or believed that Exchequer money is to be had for the asking, traders and others about to engage on capital expenditure on their own account hold back to see if they can secure a subsidy from public funds.   The amount of capital development on hand at any time is
very large, and any lag in its execution slows up trade. For these reasons there is good ground for fear that the first effect of the announcement by the Government of their intention to appoint a new body whose -function would be to recommend a vast expenditure on Capital works would be to decrease employment rather than to increase it.28. Beyond the public works programme, there is nothing in the Plans likely to have a direct effect on the amount of employment available for a substantial time to come. The ideal of the settlement of a new population on the land is recognised in the Plans themselves to be only slowly attainable over a period of years. As will be shown, there is little that is both new and valuable in the plans as affecting overseas trade, while the proposals for the reorganisation of industry are actually liable to involve the disappearance of their employment for many who to-day are working.29. In short, the Government do not feel that any real weight can be attached to the estimates of additional employment which are contained in the Plans, or indeed to any estimates that could be made on a similar basis. The flaws in the calculation are in part self-evident and in part revealed by past experience, and it is to be anticipated that the announcement of such a plan, instead of being hailed as the inauguration of a new era of prosperity, would rather be received with apprehension, and instead of causing general industry to expand, might only too probably cause it to contracts[11899]
The Plans propose the settlement within a comparatively short time of half a million workers in agricultural pursuits on the land, and hope thereby to provide work for an equal number in ancillary industries. In the Governments view such a programme of settlement could be achieved, if at all, only at the cost of a large artificially-created increase in the price of food as well as injury to our friendly relations with the Dominions and other countries and intensified difflcidties for those engaged in export trades. The Government, who, by various measures of assistance and reorganisation, have already done much to restore confidence to British agriculture, could not see their way to commit the country to so hazardous and uncertain an adventure as would be involved in Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s proposals.30. It is manifest from Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s memorandum that he attaches the utmost importance to his agricultural proposals both as a means of finding increased employment and for the purpose of developing the national resources. In the original document the subject was treated under no less than seventeen heads, and it may be said that it forms the backbone of Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s plans, and by it they must stand or fall. At an early stage, therefore, the Cabinet Committee realised that here was the vital point, and they have accordingly examined the proposals with the utmost care and attention.31. This examination was much helped by figures which Mr. Lloyd George and his experts supplied. According to a memorandum drawn up and agreed with them, the following state-ment represents his considered view as to the possibility of increasing the home production of&apos;food : First, the elimination of unemployment would increase the consumption of home-grown produce by some  54 millions a year.Second, the reorganisation of agricultural marketing, the stimulation of local growing of fresh produce, and propaganda designed to induce consumers to prefer home-grown foodstuffs to preserved imported goods would increase the consumption of home-grown produce by  142 millions per annum.Finally, a further  92 millions per annum of produce now imported from abroad should he produced at home.In this way a market for additional home produce to the value at present prices of no less than  288 millions per annum is arrived at, and Mr. Lloyd George estimates that this increase in production might afford employment for an additional 1,200,000 people in agriculture.This represents something more than a doubling of present output.32. In the early stages, so it is understood, Mr. Lloyd George would not expect so large an increase in consumption, nor aim at so large an increase of output. He would propose that, to begin with, the increase in home production might be such as would employ an additional 500,000 workers on the land, and taking the same propor-tions as above this would represent an additional output in this country of  120 millions a year, an increase upon present output of, s&amp;y, 50 or 60 per cent.33. Forecasts and estimates are necessarily uncertain, and Mr. Lloyd George would no doubt wish, as the Government would wish, to make it clear that any calculations of this kind can only be approximate and provisional. But, subject to this, the general range of the figures is useful in reaching a judgment upon the problem. On this basis, the Government have three comments to make upon these plans.34. In the first place, the larger figure of  288 millions represents an increase in the consumption of home products which is probably impracticable under any conditions.   To base a pro-
gramme for increased agricultural production and employment in this country on the prospects of an increase in the consumption of home-grown produce by such a figure would be to invite disaster. To increase agricultural output within a short term of years by only 50 or 60 per cent, would be an achievement not approached by any country of Europe, even under the most intensive policies of agrarian develop-ment that the modern world has known.35. In the second place, the increased output, even if practicable and even when coupled with the compulsory marketing and other measures proposed in the Plans, could not be secured unless it offered also a considerable increase of prices to the producer. It is laid down in the Plans with extreme emphasis that an increase in food prices is no part of the policy; but this apparently depends upon the assumption there stated that, if agricultural prices were brought back to near the level at which they stood in 1931 or 1932, that would be quite sufficient to ensure that agriculture could be profitably expanded. But as a matter of fact, the wholesale agricultural price index for 1931, when both wages and employment in agriculture were falling, was 120, and for 1934 (including wheat and cattle payments) 119, a difference of less than 1 per cent. To produce any appreciable effect on agricultural production or on agricultural employment, a much more substantial rise would be necessary and it is unlikely, to say the least, that the result would not be reflected in the price the consumer would have to pay.36. A further factor tending to increase prices is implied in the statement, on which Mr. Lloyd George repeatedly insisted in the course of the discussions, that foodstuffs were now being dumped into this country, and that this dumping of foodstuffs must be stopped. . If, according to his own definition, dumping is the selling in this country of - foodstuffs at prices below those charged in the country of origin, the exclusion of these imports, whatever the merits of such a policy, must tend to raise the prices of any of the food-istuffs which to-day are being sold to the consumer at lower rates than those prevailing in the country from which they come.37. Alternatively, the Plans seem to suggest three ways of making farming profitable without any raising of prices to the consumer: (a) concentration upon those foodstuffs that are best eaten fresh and involve a large amount of labour for their produc-tion, (b) compulsory and more efficient marketing organisation, and (c) better equipment. On the first of these suggestions, it is perhaps sufficient to say that, whatever its value in relation to market gardening and the creation of cottage holdings for the unemployed, it is not evident how its adoption could make the industry generally more profitable or contribute materially to the attainment of aims so far-reaching as those propounded in the Plans.38. As to the second suggestion, the references to marketing organisation contained in the Plans are so vague that comment is difficult. The main impression that they convey is that still further arrangements for the organised collection and bulk transport of produce under compulsory conditions would in themselves go far to provide a solution for the question of prices. The Government agree that the question of marketing lies at the centre of our agricultural problems, and they may claim to have made important experiments in that field, which are steadily being improved as experience is gained. But such compulsory organisation could not, in the light of their experience, play so great a part in transforming the agricul-tural industry as the Plans anticipate.39. As to the third suggestion, for the better equipment of the industry, the Plans set out a large variety of works designed to secure the fullest utilisation of our soil. The first of these is land reclama-tion. There are, it is true, areas of foreshore, heath and marsh which could be reclaimed at a cost, but the.land reclaimed would admittedly not give a return adequate to cover the capital outlay needed to render it cultivable. In any ease, the work could only add to the number of acres under cultivation; it would not increase the profits of agriculture as a whole.
40. The second matter referred to is land drainage, for which the document advocates liberal financial assistance not only in order to reclaim waterlogged land, but also to avert the danger, which Mr. Lloyd George regards as imminent, that more land may be driven out of cultivation by flooding. There is, of course, much work to be done in this connection, and the Government have shown their keen interest in it. The Catchment Boards proposed in the Act of 1930 have been brought into existence and have been assisted by substantial grants from national funds. But it is not a matter in which work can be hurriedly undertaken; additional surveys are now in progress, but they must be completed before any comprehensive works on the large rivers can be carried out. Moreover, great as may be the value of these works to particular areas of land, they have only an indirect relation to the profitability of the farming industry as a whole.41. Recommendations are also contained in the Plans on such points. as field drainage, liming, the supply and utilisation of phosphates and fertilisers, increasing supplies of good strains of grasses and clovers, and the repair or replacement of farm buildings. Be-equipment of this character would no doubt, in differing degrees in different cases, render production less costly and more efficient-. In such cases, landowners can already raise loans under favourable conditions to cover capital expenditure on permanent improvements under the provisions of the Improvement of Land Acts. While the reconditioning of agricultural land and buildings and the provision of labour-saving machines and implements would tend to raise the output per head, none of these proposals will bear the weight put upon them in the Plans as means of greatly increasing the employing power of the agricultural industry.42. There are other passages in the document which suggest similar reflections. Generally, whether Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s proposals - - under these heads are looked at individually or collectively, the Government are quite unable to see any ground for believing that they would lead to such an increased output as he has in mind, unless accompanied by the direct and immediate stimulus of a large increase in prices to the producers of the commodities concerned.43. After considering these alternatives, we therefore come back to the issue of increased prices. Ten years ago, when agriculture received for its products fully one-third more than it receives to-day, agricultural output increased slowly, but, owing in particular to the introduction of labour-saving devices, agricultural employment on the whole declined. To-day farmers would not, in fact, be prepared to increase employment to anything like the extent contemplated, unless they could be assured of returns far higher than are now obtainable and with a guarantee of permanence. The establishment of immense numbers of small-holdings (a course which it is understood Mr. Lloyd George would not advocate) could not achieve success except under- similar conditions. Exchequer subsidies sufficient to produce the necessary increased return would be quite beyond the power of the taxpayer to bear. In the Government&apos;s view it is quite useless to imagine that profuse expenditure on works or equipment or altered methods of marketing will effect the object. The simple fact is that the proposal involves a great increase artificially created by the State in the cost of the people&apos;s food. How great the increase would have to be it is not possible closely to define; but two examples will show that it would certainly have to be severe. A detailed estimate, which was placed before Mr. Lloyd George, showed that, in the process of replacing  92 millions a year of imported food by home produce, the wholesale price of the foodstuffs concerned would inevitably rise by approximately  100 millions and if the. retail price of food rose no more than to the level of 1925, food which costs Is. in the shops to-day would cost nearly Is. 5d. In fact, whatever may be his intention, Mr. Lloyd George must, in the,end, choose between dear food and the complete practical failure of his plan.44. The third comment which the Government would make on   these   Plans   is   that,    apart   from   intensive   propaganda
against the importation of eggs, meat, vegetable,, fruit and. dairy, produce, they contemplate, at any rate for a period, the shutting out of imports of foodstuffs to the value of  92 millions a year. This reduction, of imports would affect only a limited range of commodities, but it would gravely affect a number of predominantly agricultural countries, including some of the most important parts of the Empire. For example, among the Dominions New Zealand might lose at least one-quarter of her trade, and though Australia and Canada might find some compensation for serious losses in increased, sales of animal feeding stuffs, they could not escape a severe dislooa-tion of their industries. Moreover, the proposal would exclude more than four-fifths of the exports of Denmark to this country and more than one-third of the exports of China, though in another passage of Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s document proposals are made for a vast increase in our trade with that country.45. An effort to reduce the exports of Dominions and friendly foreign countries on this scale would repeat that form of severe agrarian protectionism, the growth of which on the Continent of Europe has been repeatedly criticised as one of the major factors in the curtailment of international trade and the financial difficulties of primary producing countries. Notwithstanding the serious obstacles to the general recovery of international trade, the policy of the Govern-ment has been, as far as possible, to promote the mutual exchange of goods with the very Dominions and foreign countries which would be most severely affected by these restrictions. This policy of trade agreements has already produced important results. To adopt now a policy of restricting agricultural imports on the scale suggested by Mr. Lloyd George would destroy these gains; it would fatally impair the ability and the willingness of the countries concerned to take our exports of manufactured goods, and might increase instead of decreasing unemployment in this country.46. To sum up the objections which the Government see in Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s proposals : (1) The possible increase in the consumption of home products for the near future is seriously exaggerated.(2) The increase in home production at which the Plans aim in the next few years could not be attained even as a result of the costly measures proposed, and it would inevitably involve a great increase in the price of the people&apos;s food, which in turn would prevent such expansion in consump-tion as would otherwise be possible.&apos;(3) Grave injury would be done to Imperial relations and trade by the drastic reduction or dislocation of the exports of the Dominions.(4) Fatal damage would be caused to our trade with friendly foreign countries whose exports would be even more drastically curtailed.(5) They would therefore create unemployment for our industrial population.47. In many countries agriculture is still struggling against the gravest odds. Disastrous falls in prices have followed upon a glut of production accompanied by a falling demand; the problem of marketing the produce of farms at all, even at utterly unre-remunerative prices, has been the constant preoccupation of statesmen and of agricultural leaders. But in this island the worst effects of the crisis have been averted. Agricultural prices (taking into account- the wheat and beef subsidies) have risen since the spring of 1932. Agricultural wages are now rising also, and the average minimum adult wage rate prevailing to-day in England and Wales is the highest ever recorded since the regulating Act of 1924 came into operation. In contrast, agricultural wages in the United States last year were little more than half their level in 1927. Meanwhile, prices of foodstuffs to the ultimate consumer in this country, as measured by the cost of living index for the past six months, were 11 points less than for the comparable period of 1931.48.   Throughout this period of recovery the Government have consistently set before themselves the task of securing for farmers a
reasonable price for their products, while at the same time they have encouraged the maximum supply of foodstuffs to consumers at the lowest prices consistent with that policy. The individual measures taken to this end have been numerous and varied. The arable areas have had the advantage of the Wheat Act and of the import duty upon foreign oats, as well as of continued assistance to sugar beet growers. Customs duties have led to a substantial increase in the production of fruit, vegetables and flowers. Marketing Boards have been established for hops, pigs and bacon, milk, and potatoes, commodities which represent more than two-fifths of the total output of home agriculture. The dairying industry has also received extensive Exchequer assistance under the Milk Act of 1934, including special allocations to encourage the consumption of liquid milk. Similarly, during the progress of negotiations with the Dominions and foreign countries on a long-term policy for the live-stock industry, Exchequer assistance is being afforded to the producers of fat cattle.49. These are the aspects of agricultural policy which have engaged the first attention of the Government. It was necessary to protect the industry from the worst effects of the crisis before an extension could properly be considered. But extension has not been lost sight of, and in many directions it has already taken place. The development of small holdings is steadily progressing, especially in Scotland. It is obviously desirable that the constant decline in the agricultural population which has proceeded for many years should be at least arrested, and the Government, during their tenure of office, have taken the essential preliminary steps to produce the conditions which alone will make this possible. This policy will be continued and developed, but success cannot be brought about by disregarding the obvious difficulties and dangers of too rapid an expansion.
SECTION IV. HOUSING AND TOWN PLANNING.The proposals concerning housing ignore completely the unprecedented advance in building activity which has been stimulated by the Government and is still increasing. Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s proposals would dislocate this activity while putting nothing comparable in its place. As regards town planning the proposals would obstruct rather than stimulate the local and regional planning now going on.50. There have been and are two main sources of supply of houses : building by private enterprise without financial assistance, and building by local authorities with such assistance.51. From the standpoint of employment only, the present relation of these two&apos; sources of supply may be gauged from the fact that during the year ended the 31st March last, out of the total of about 348,000 houses provided in the United Kingdom, about 292,000 houses were erected by private enterprise and 49,000 by local authorities. It is not often realised that over the whole period since house building was resumed after the Armistice up to the end of March 1935, non-subsidised private industry has provided 1,319,572 houses, nearly half of the total of 2,719,562 provided.52. From the standpoint of housing needs, two facts illustrate the position. Firstly, the Eegistrar-General, on the results of the 1931 census, estimated that about 1,700,000 new houses were required in England and Wales in the period 1931-1941; during the 4 years ended the 31st March, 1935, approximately one million new houses have actually been already built. Secondly, in that large total four years&apos; output, the most remarkable feature has been the continuous acceleration of production. Thus, while 200,000 houses were built in England and Wales during the year ended the 31st March, 1932, 327,000 houses were built during the year ended the 31st March, 1935, a record number in the history of the country, and a record which is all the more striking when compared with the 130,000 houses which marked the peak output in any one year before the war, when the population was increasing more rapidly than at present. For Scotland the figures are 13,708 for the year ended on the 31st March, 1932, and 20,851 for the year ended on the 31st March, 1935.53. The policy which has produced these results is that of abandoning a general subsidy for house construction so as.to leave the building industry, free from subsidised competition, to provide a pool of houses for the general needs of the people and of concentrating the activities of local authorities working under subsidy on those special housing needs which still cannot be met in the ordinary way of business without subsidy. These special needs are the replacement of unfit houses through the slum-clearance programme, and the con-struction of new dwellings for families discovered by actual survey to be living in overcrowded conditions. It may be mentioned in passing that in the first five months of 1935 new houses for slum replacement have been sanctioned at the rate of over 7,300 a month in the United Kingdom; already, at the end of May, nearly 147,000 houses had been approved for this purpose, of which about 88,000 houses had been completed.54. The policy adopted has been framed in the light of past experience. It assigns to the building industry, the local authorities and the Government the parts in a common task which they can most appropriately play. It is overtaking the housing shortage in the country at a rate never before approached, and it rests on the principles best calculated to provide the maximum of employment in the industry concerned. Indeed, the industry has made striking development in the last few years, has provided a steadily increasing volume of employment, and is now producing results and providing employment on a scale hitherto unknown.55. No mention is made by Mr. Lloyd George of this remarkable progress which has been produced by a combination of public and[11899] d
private enterprise. The need of the country is estimated by him at two million houses during the next few years, and it is apparently intended that these are to be provided by direct State action without reference to any provision of houses which may be made by other methods. It will be seen from what has already been said that at present rates of building by private industry and local authorities the two million houses would in fact be produced within a comparatively short period. But if a new body with over-riding authority is interposed it must inevitably drive all other agencies out of the field.56. It is contended by Mr. Lloyd George that the efforts of the industry have made only a minor contribution to the provision of dwellings for the lower-paid workers. On this it is pertinent to observe, first, that of the approximate total of 800,000 new houses provided in England and Wales by the industry from March 1931 to March 1935 nearly 90 per cent, are under  26 per annum rateable value ( 35 in London). The tendency of unsubsidised small house building since it was resumed, mainly as a result of the Act of 1928, has been to spread steadily down from the relatively more expensive house to the relatively less expensive house. This process has now reached a point at which it makes a most substantial contribution to the provision of houses within the means of large classes of wage-earners, especially the &quot;black-coated&quot; wage earners, who require, but do not always receive, consideration. Second, the building industry for the last three years has been producing houses, of which practically the whole are of relatively small size, at an average rate of approximately 200,000 a year. These houses find occupiers; otherwise the process would not continue, to say nothing of expanding as it has done in the last two years. The result of the process continued over a period of years must be very largely to increase the total housing accommodation available in the country and to make the most powerful contribution to the general relief of overcrowding, which is admitted to be one of the main objects to be secured by housing policy. Thirdly, those who occupy the new houses provided by the building industry set free other accommo-dation and the transfers thus made do, in fact, result in large measure in the provision of better accommodation within the means of those who for one reason or another do not see their way to go into the new houses.57. There is mention in the Plans of a present need for at least 100,000 houses in the rural districts. This figure has been stated before, but it is unsupported by any survey or statistical evidence. In fact, when the special Housing (Rural Autho-rities) Act, 1931, was passed, the total number of houses in respect of which assistance was sought did not exceed 7,000 in England and Wales and 1,500 in Scotland, and on examination the major part of the need alleged to exist was found to be in respect of unfit or overcrowded houses. Unfit houses are being dealt with under the slum-clearance programme, based on a detailed survey, and overcrowded houses will be dealt with under the Bill at present before Parliament, again after a detailed survey.58. On the planning aspect of the question, Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s conception appears to be that of a&apos;single national plan proposed by a central planning Board, and imposed, whether by compulsion or persuasion, upon the whole country. But such a national plan could only be based on a survey of the country, district by district, area by area, region by region; and this is precisely the process which is now being carried out by the Town and Country Planning Authorities under the Town and Country Planning Acts. Though Mr. Lloyd George attempts to represent his centralised system as being compatible with a continuance of this process, it really involves an entirely different conception of the relationship between central and local governments. Nor does Mr. Lloyd George really touch the crucial problem to be solved in any scheme for the creation, of new centres of population : the problem of how the movement of industry can be influenced so as to conform to such a scheme. It is not clear whether the Plans rely for this purpose on persuasion and propaganda, or on subsidies and compulsion.
59. - The close association of housing with town and country planning is a strong, argument for retaining, in the case of town and country planning, the same relationship of central to local bodies which has been so successful in housing. Locally housing and town and country planning are, as a rule, in the hands of the same local authority and centrally, the need for the same association is recog-nised by their co-ordinated supervision by the Minister of Health, and,, in Scotland, by the Department of Health. The national aspects of road planning, railway extension and electricity distribution can be and are being handled by the Ministry of Transport, and there would be no advantage in setting up a new Board to perform the same functions. The fact that town and country planning cannot with advantage be considered in isolation by each local government district, is recognised by the provision which has been made for the combination of these districts in regional bodies. Progress which was momentarily retarded during the passage of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1932, has been resumed, and, as is normal with the operations of local authorities, its momentum is steadily increasing. To interrupt this process of local and regional planning at this stage would hardly conduce to that rapid and orderly action on the need for which Mr. Lloyd George so constantly insists.I 11899]
SECTION V.-INDUSTRIAL REORGANISATION.Mr. Lloyd George does not claim that his proposals for industrial reorganisation will decrease unemployment, and their vagueness contrasts unfavourably with the positive and practical measures for reorganisation already taken by the Government.60. The proposals of the plan for industrial reorganisation, and those in the succeeding chapter for the development of overseas trade, have been examined by the Government with the greatest attention and care. It is here that Mr. Lloyd George touches upon those aspects of our economy most directly and most seriously affected by the conditions of the outside world. It is, above all, in this spbere that the root remedies for a large part of the present unemployment must be sought, and, above all, in this sphere that the foundations of future prosperity must be well and truly laid.61. On the subject of industrial reorganisation the general view of Mr. Lloyd George may perhaps be illustrated by the following quotations : &quot; The proposals grow out naturally from constitutional precedent and modern developments of our economic system. This system needs amendment and improvement to adapt it to the needs of this generation. The evils now resulting from it show that. It can be amended without being scrapped. The immense advantages of individual enterprise, energy and initiative-tive which our present economic system fosters are not to be lightly sacrificed. They must rather be controlled and cultivated, so that they may yield an ordered harvest for the nation.&quot;&quot; . . . . If the existing machinery of private enterprise and finance is unable to achieve this, then that machinery must be improved, and, if need be, supplemented.&quot;62. If the various references to industrial reorganisation are taken together, three general ideas seem to run through the suggestions. It is laid down that the State should plan industry; it is vaguely implied that in certain eases the State should share in responsibility for control; and it is suggested (perhaps not very con-sistently) that the State should persuade industry to adopt particular courses by the grant of liberal financial assistance.63. One of the functions of the National Development Board which figures so largely in the document is to prepare schemes for industrial organisation. The State must &quot;think out what industrial developments are desirable, and under cover of its guarantee direct the capital resources of the nation to such productive uses.&quot; On the one hand private enterprise is to remain in being; on the other hand an instrument of the State is to take the initiative in planning. In this way dilemmas have often been experienced in practice. For one thing, if the State takes the initiative and, above all, if in taking the initiative it holds out the attractions of public subsidies or wields the weapon of compulsion, voluntary reorganisation will cease, for the private entrepreneur will naturally sit back and await the State decision likely to be thrust upon him.64. In any plan that the State evolves a question arises of the responsibility for mistakes of judgment and of losses thereby involved. The State must see both that the right management is available and that it is actually placed in command, for upon skilful manage-ment success will ultimately depend, and the management of large planned organisations highly tests even the ablest men. Apart from this, it is not easy to see how an outside State instrument can acquire the intimate specialised knowledge and experience of particular industries needed to dictate with confidence and with authority the manner in which profitable employment is best increased. For these reasons, it has seemed to the Government that organisation must come primarily from within.
65. This is not to say that the State has no part in this matter. On the contrary, the Government have shown how much can be achieved, not by compulsion, nor yet by bribing businesses into plans in which they had little or no part, but rather by stimulating or assisting spontaneous development through varying methods fitted to the actual circumstances of each case.66. The iron and steel industry presents a striking example. Importations of foreign iron and steel have been kept in check by Customs duties : output has risen by 70 per cent, as compared with three years ago; exports have increased and consumption at home reached a record, figure in 1934. Prom the outset of the Tariff regime both, the Government and the Import Duties Advisory Committee have required the industry to concern themselves actively with reorganisation and to use their new bargaining power in order to arrive at satisfactory arrangements with the European Steel Cartel. Notable examples of reconstruction are the reorganisation of the Colville interests in Scotland, the new enterprise at Corby, the reconstruction of the steel works at Cardiff, Scunthorpe and Workington and the amalgamation of the stainless steel undertakings. The position of the industry showed signs of becoming more difficult at the end of 1934 by reason of increased imports of foreign material. The duties were then increased and in this way a weapon was forged with which the industry could bargain effectively with the European Cartel for an international agreement satisfactory to this country. The effectiveness of this weapon was shown at once by the conclusion on 30th April last of an interim agreement for a period of three months, providing that imports of cartel products into the United Kingdom were not to exceed a rate of 643,000 tons per annum (the 1933 level) for the three months. The immediate object of the increased duties having thus been attained, the higher duties were suspended for the period of the temporary agreement. In the meantime, negotiations for a long term agreement were actively pursued, and on 4th June the heads of a long term agreement were settled for the co-operation of the British industry with the Cartel at the expiry of the temporary agreement on 7th August. Briefly, the major agreement provides that imports into the United Kingdom from cartel countries shall not exceed 670,000 tons (which includes several products not covered by the 643,000 tons provided for in the interim agreement) for the first year, and 525,000 tons in each subsequent year of the agreement. The agreement also secures for the British industry that proportion of the total export trade in neutral markets which it enjoyed in 1934.67. In shipping the grant of a subsidy for a limited time to tramp shipowners was made conditional on a real measure of organi-sation within the industry in the United Kingdom and on a determined effort to arrive at an agreement with foreign shipowners for the elimination of redundant tonnage, that is, an effort to secure international organisation. These conditions are being complied with.68. The importance of improving the materiel of an industry and of scrapping obsolete equipment is recognised by the Government scheme for the grant of loans on favourable terms to owners of cargo vessels for the reconstruction or modernisation of their fleets on condition of scrapping a prescribed proportion of old tonnage.69. Government financial assistance for the completion of the Queen Mary was conditional on the reduction of competition in the North Atlantic passenger trade by the merger of the Cunard and White Star services.70. In the cotton-spinning industry the Government promised legislation to carry out a scheme for the elimination of surplus spinning capacity, drawn up and approved by the industry. This measure has now been introduced. It provides a contingent Government guarantee which will enable the capital sum required to be raised cheaply. The Government have also passed legislation enabling statutory sanction to be given to. wage agreements in the weaving section of the cotton industry, and an order has recently been made under this Act, which will safeguard the industry from the difficulties caused by the under-cutting of wages.
71.   An example of an important reconstruction in anotherindustry which present conditions have rendered possible withoutdirect Government intervention is the fusion of the Powell Duffryn Steam Coal Company and the Welsh Associated Collieries.72. As has been indicated, planning is at times mentioned in the document as coupled with control and at other times as coupled with financial assistance. Broadly, Mr. Lloyd George is understood as desiring to retain private enterprise and not to replace it by public control. But the National Development Board is to secure the setting up of an Iron and Steel Board, which will &quot;take control of the industry and plan, its policy,&quot; and it is to arrange for the establishment of a suitable controlling authority for the cotton industry.&quot; If these vague words are intended to enshrine any policy other than that now followed, they seem to imply the abandonment of private enterprise in these industries.73. Alternatively, the grant of financial assistance is contem-plated in the form of Exchequer guarantees. A policy of Exchequer guarantees, as an inducement to reorganisation, is only capable of application in a limited field. The value of a guarantee to a credit-worthy business capable of borrowing cheaply on its own account can easily be exaggerated; it is less important than the general reduction of interest rates which the Government has already secured. Where margins are narrow, a guarantee will in suitable conditions enable valuable works which would otherwise be deferred to be put in hand at once, and a striking instance of such a case is to be found in the proposals recently laid before Parliament in connection with electrification and railway development in London. But such projects cannot safely be taken to indicate that a great extension of guarantees could be used as an effective lever for reorganisation or for directing new enterprises into areas which it now avoids. This latter problem is one which is worthy of all study, but it involves considerations which Mr. Lloyd George appears to ignore.74. To sum up, Mr. Lloyd George proposes to plan, to control or to finance industry. He does not say how this is to be done. He has suggested nothing that is at once new and practicable. The Government have taken and are taking in various industries practical measures suited to particular cases, and they are convinced that this is the best method to follow. It must not be forgotten that a mistaken policy would soon undermine industrial confidence, the lack of which was the cause of our late decline, and the restoration of which has been the foundation of our recovery.
SECTION VI.-OVERSEAS TRADE.The . Plans  recognise   the  difficulties  presented   by  efforts  to. improve our overseas trade relations and trading opportunities, but they ignore ivhat has already been achieved or is being now under- . taken, to which they add little of value.75. The immense importance to our economy of a large and balanced international trade has been discussed in an earlier passage of this note. &apos; By the use of tariffs, by the negotiation of trade agree-ments and in other ways, the Government have striven to right the balance of trade and to open new avenues for our exports.76. The Import Duties Act was passed in February 1932. It imposed ;with some exceptions) a flat rate duty of 10 per cent, on foreign imports. By this Act also the Import Duties Advisory Committee were charged to advise on the construction of a tariff (over and above the flat rate) to aid home industry, though with due regard to the interests of using as well as of producing industries. Within two months of their appointment the Committee recom-mended, and Parliament confirmed, a general scheme of additional duties on manufactured goods.77. The Committee then directed their efforts to meet the circumstances of individual industries. They have now spent three years on this work, which has- contributed substantially to the improvement in the figures of employment and to the increase in industrial production. These results have been accompanied by contributions to the Exchequer from the duties of over  20 million a year.78. At the Ottawa Conference in the summer of 1932 the key-note of policy was the stimulation of Empire trade by the greatest possible reduction of Empire trade barriers. The main contribution of this country was the accord of entry, free of all duty, to the whole range of goods from the Dominions (and Southern Rhodesia) with whom agreements were concluded and from India, which otherwise would have become dutiable under the new tariff. To assist those parts of the Empire in special directions, special duties on a range of foreign goods were also imposed.79. The Dominions and India, for their part, accorded to many of our goods reductions of duties and increased preferences over foreign goods. India, of her own accord, instituted at Ottawa the policy of Empire preference as such, and freely granted preferences to a wide range of United Kingdom goods.80. The Ottawa Agreements have now been in force for some three years, and the results begin to show themselves in the trade statistics. As regards imports into the United Kingdom, the Dominions began to experience the advantages of our new policy in the spring of 1932. Between 1931 and 1934 imports from the &quot;Ottawa&quot; Dominions (including India) increased by nearly  30 millions. The advantages accorded to our exports by the Dominions did not come into force until towards the end of 1932. Between that year and 1934 our exports to the &apos;&apos; Ottawa &apos;&apos; Dominions (including India) increased by about  26 millions.81. Following the Ottawa Agreements, the Government embarked on the policy of developing export trade by negotiating trade agreements with foreign countries. This policy was rendered possible by the tariff, the creation of which brought home to foreign countries the importance to them of our market and the necessity of coming to terms with us. In the result commercial agreements have been concluded in the last three years with seventeen foreign countries, many of which are amongst our most important customers. Negotiations are now proceeding, or in contemplation, with a number of other countries. But it must be recognised that while tariff negotiations have been conducted with many countries where they gave a prospect of success, in the case, that is, of countries which have a favourable balance of trade and whose economic basis is in the main complementary to ours, they cannot be equally effective in the case of countries which are our commercial competitors in the markets of the world.
82. Among the benefits secured are reductions of foreign tariffs on goods of special interest to this country, undertakings for the purchase of United Kingdom produce and manufactures, fair quotas for United Kingdom exports, the payment of old debts due to our traders, and the provision of exchange to pay for current trade, as well as the better treatment of British shipping. The general trend of the coal export trade resulting from quotas and other artificial restrictions imposed overseas is shown by the fact that exports of coal.to countries with which agreements have not been made decreased by approximately If million tons in 1934 as compared with 1932. During the same period the exports of coal to those countries with which agreements were made increased by approximately million tons, resulting in the additional working of over 2 million man shifts.88. As regards trade generally, the advantages of the agree-ments concluded in 1933 can be roughly measured by comparing our exports to the countries concerned in 1932 and 1934. Between 1932 and 1934 exports to foreign countries as a whole increased from  199-1 million to  210^- million, or by about 5 per cent., and exports to British countries from  165^ million to  185-g- million, or by about 12 per cent. In the same period exports to the group of countries covered by the agreements concerned increased by no less than 33 per cent., the most favourable case being Finland, where the improvement reached 60 per cent.84. While the volume of world trade in 1934 barely exceeded that in 1933, exports of United Kingdom goods increased in volume by over 7 per cent. There has, in fact, been a steady increase in United Kingdom exports for more than two years, while the total value of all world trade has remained substantially unchanged. In the first quarter of this year our exports were 18 per cent, greater than two years earlier.85. In the meanwhile the Government has been engaged also upon the economic problems of the Colonial Empire. A complete Economic Survey has for the first time been drawn up. Works of development have continued to be fostered from the Colonial Development Fund. Increased activities have been undertaken in the field of research. But the chief problem of these times is that of finding markets for Colonial produce. By the Import Duties Act the Colonies were given a wide range of preferences which have since been extended. As a result of the Ottawa agreements, Colonial preference is now substantially Empire-wide, and is even extended by other Empire countries to Colonies and mandated territories which are precluded from reciprocating. In all foreign trade treaties the Government endeavour to obtain for Colonial products a secure foothold in the foreign markets concerned.86. Upon the other side our exports to the Colonies now repre-sent more than 10 per cent, of our total trade as against 6 per cent, in 1924. The recent introduction of the quota on foreign textiles a proposal widely and readily accepted in the Colonial territories concerned has resulted in a 150 per cent, rise in our cotton textile exports to these lands.87. In passing to Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s proposals, the Govern-ment are obliged to record with some disappointment that his suggestions add little to what, amid the greatest external difficulties, has been achieved by their policy. Nothing in his document suggests that he sees any opportunity for useful measures on the part of the Government on lines other than those they now pursue, save in particular regions, namely, the Colonies, India, China and Kussia.88. As regards the Colonies, Mr. Lloyd George, advocates an increase in the production of raw materials which we should purchase and pay for by the export to the Colonies of our manufactured goods. He refers also to the. creation of new markets for Colonial products in other parts of the world. The exploitation of mutual trade with the Colonies and the creation of new markets for them are matters to which the Govern-ment themselves attach the greatest importance.   They are disposed
to&apos;agree that further development in this direction, is still possible, and the means of effecting this are under&apos; examination; but itmust be,emphasised.that in present conditions the problem of finding new markets for colonial products is more pressing than that of increasing the amount of production. .  ;:89. The Indian market, Mr. Lloyd George says, is suffering bitterly from the fall of world prices and from the effects of British monetary policy. The collocation of these two causes is, at the. least, surprising. As has often been stated, one of the objects of the British monetary policy has been to arrest the fall of prices and to take all practicable steps to reverse it.90. While in many foreign countries prices have been falling to the continuous injury of employment and of trade and in others great currency vicissitudes have been suffered, the pound sterling since its divorce from gold has been maintained as the steadiest currency in the world. If its value has varied as against the value of gold, that is due to vagaries in the value of gold, not of the pound. The pur-chasing power of sterling in the hands of the consumer has been unimpaired: the cost of living has, indeed, slightly fallen. Mean-time, a small but definite rise in the general index of wholesale sterling prices conceals a much more substantial rise in the prices of primary products, the special index of which has risen from 100 to 140, and it is the prices of primary products in this country, their principal market, which are of special importance to India and the Empire. The countries of the Empire and many foreign countries which have allied themselves to sterling have also, in trade within the group, enjoyed immunity from the currency fluctuations which have afflicted the other countries of the world.91. Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s assertion that the adoption by us of an expansionist policy of public development here would induce an upward movement of wholesale prices is one which the Government do not accept. The adoption, on the other hand, of a policy of cheap money and the institution of lower rates of interest have been powerful agencies in producing the rise of wholesale prices which has, in fact, been secured.92. Mr. Lloyd George writes tentatively and vaguely also of special measures in relation to Indian currency. He says that this matter should be promptly and carefully examined by currency experts. It has been so examined and the Government are aware of no measures, other than those now pursued, which could usefully be adopted.93. The document also mentions the question of transport; but in the existing condition of Indian trade there is no real demand for increased capital outlay on new lines or rolling stock beyond what is being undertaken at the present time. Indeed, much of the rolling stock is at present not being used to the full capacity owing to insufficiency of traffic. Having regard to the favourable conditions governing Indian credit in London and in India at the present time, the Government of India would have no difficulty in expanding the railway programme if conditions justified it.94. The Government are entirely at one with Mr. Lloyd George in desiring to secure by all means in their power the welfare and prosperity of this great sub-continent; but they find nothing in his proposals which will assist to this end.95. Mr. Lloyd George proposes that in common with the United States and Bussia, we should join with Japan in aiding China to &quot; get on her own feet.&quot; We should effect this object, in his view, primarily by means of financial assistance for the development of her internal transport. China has suffered grievously in recent years both from internal dissension, from the ravages of the world crisis, and from currency misfortunes. Our interest in China is great, and the question of possible action to assist that country is continuously engaging the attention of the Government in common with the other interested Powers. Only recently arrangements have been made for a Financial Mission to proceed to China to explore [11899] E
the problems to which the situation gives rise and to advise the Government as to the best, means for their solution. Some expansion of our trade with China can be hoped for, but the situation is such that the memorandum, in speaking : of unlimited room for its expansion, can only be said to ignore the hard facts of the case as it actually stands to-day.96. About Russia, Mr. Lloyd George says little. His suggestion that there is here also unlimited room for tlie expansion of our export . trade seems to ignore, recent fundamental developments in that country. It is the well-known intention of the Soviet Government to make Russia as far as possible self-sufficient, and the construction work which has been carried through there during the last few years has made substantial progress in this direction. The Government have all along, however, been fully aware of the importance of this great market, and the Export Credits machinery has been, and still is, available to assist in financing Russian orders. Our exporters have made very substantial use of this machinery. In addition, moreover, by the Commercial Agreement of 1934, the Government have taken steps to improve our balance of trade with Russia.97. That every effort should be made to expand our export trade and to improve the external conditions against which our export industries are fighting is an axiom which none will deny. - But Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s suggestions do not contain any new objective under this head, while his agricultural proposals would have the inevitable effect of restricting the external trade which he aims at expanding. The problem is one to which the Government have given continuous attention, and the rising figures of exports are a tribute to the success of their efforts. They are satisfied that along these lines progress is most satisfactorily to be continued.
SECTION VII. SCHOOL AGE, SHORTER HOURS AND RETIRING PENSIONS.The Plans propose the raising of the school-leaving age and other social changes. The several proposals present various difficulties without materially affecting the employment problem.98. The proposal to raise the school-leaving age to 15 is one with which the Government are in strong sympathy. The late Prime Minister made it known some time ago that the question was engaging the Government&apos;s consideration, and they have just taken the&apos; important step of removing all restrictions on school buildings.99. Mr. Lloyd George writes also, though in extremely guarded terms, of a reduction in the hours of labour. &quot;Our policy should aim at the encouragement of a reduction in the weekly hours of labour, with a five-day week, in those industries which can adopt this plan immediately without any increase in the real cost of production. Co-ordinated plans of development of our national resources should result in raising the general standard of living. This implies that the advantage of increased production would be shared by the whole community. It might thus prove possible to reduce the hours of labour over a wide field, without any real increase in the cost of production.&quot;100. Mr. Lloyd George mentions in this connection that, as a result of the application of science to industry, a revolutionary increase of production per head has occurred and has caused a rapid displacement of labour. While there is much truth in the statement it cannot be accepted entirely without qualification. Although new inventions may result initially in the displacement of labour in the industry concerned, it does not follow that the total volume of employment is decreased. The number of insured persons in employment is greater to-day than ever before, and among the industries showing the greatest expansion in employment are some, such as electrical engineering, in which large use has been made of inqD roved machinery. If scientific invention in one direction enables old processes to be carried out with less expenditure of man-power, in other directions it enables entirely new products to be manu-factured, new avenues of employment to be opened out and a higher-standard of comfort to be enjoyed throughout the community.101. The question thus has two sides. It also throws up many practical difficulties. The Government understand Mr. Lloyd George to hold that any reduction of hours of work should entail no reduction of wages; but, in the absence of international agreement on this subject, which is far from being attained, many industries would be quite unable to contemplate the loss involved in the change. It was made clear at the recent International Labour Conference that the majority of Governments in favour of an international convention on the subject of the reduction of hours are not prepared to support the maintenance of wages as a condition of such reduction. In this they were supported by their workers&apos; representatives who were not in complete agreement with their British colleagues on this aspect of the matter.102. In general, the Government are in sympathy with Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s view, carefully guarded as it is, so far as effect can be given to it without damage to industry and without reduction of wages. Efforts made by the last Government were directed to this end, and discussions are now taking place between the Minister of Labour and particular industrial organisations on this and other cognate subjects. But it would be a mistake to count upon any substantial influence upon employment from reduction of hours at the present time. Mr. Lloyd George is understood to accept this view; the passage in his document which calculates the effect of his various proposals upon employment makes no further reference to this subject.103. Finally, it is stated that, if a surplus of unabsorbed labour is left, consideration will have to be given to &apos;&apos; the provision of[11899] f
adequate pensions at the age of 60 on condition that those receiving them retire from1 paid employment.&quot; The note nowhere elaborates this suggestion, nor does it make any proposal as to the amount of the pension. In the discussions Mr. Lloyd George was understood to suggest that the offer, of a pension of 10s. with a cottage and an allotment might tempt many workers to give up their work, although a more substantial compensation would be necessary if retirement at sixty were made compulsory.104. The provision of a cottage and an allotment in an area; in which the retiring worker wished to spend the rest of his life might be practicable and economical in particular areas or in individual cases, but as a general means of securing voluntary retirement of great numbers of city workers it seems to the Government to be quite inadequate; and its attraction would hardly be much increased by making the 10s. pension begin at 60 instead of 65 or 70.105. Various schemes for the grant of retiring pensions have from time to time been canvassed. A detailed discussion of the difficulties involved in schemes of this character is beyond the scope of this statement, but in the Governments view, based on the most careful calculations that can be made, any reasonably fair scheme capable of removing from the field of employment the main propor-tion of workers who are over sixty years of age would involve additional annual taxation of at least  100 million per annum.
SECTION VIII.-PUBLIC WORKS SCHEMES.The public, works, programme produces no new and good suggestions for developing our national resources and improving national&quot; conditions. *106. The Plans are understood to advocate the early expenditure of upwards of  100 million on the completion of the trunk road system, including the remodelling of existing main roads with twin carriage-ways, footpaths and cycle tracks, the strengthening of bridges, the improvement of minor roads, and so on. A number of the projects mentioned in vague terms in connection with town planning fall under the same head. Apart from heavy annual outgoings on maintenance and on minor improvements, some  150 million has been spent on major improvements of the roads of this country since the War. No country possesses a finer system than ours. Its extension and improvement, however, is part of the policy of the present Government, and they are, in fact, to-day in negotiation with Local Authorities for the settlement of a five-year plan of extensive new work.107. Mr. Lloyd George lays great stress on the question of road safety. As is well known, to no subject have the Government given greater attention; important contributions have been made by arousing the public interest on the subject and by such practical measures as the institution of pedestrian crossings and the driving tests, the imposition of the speed limit in built-up areas, and the installation of traffic light signals. The result has been a considerable decrease in the number of deaths and injuries on the road, despite an increase of some 200,000 in the number of motor vehicles as compared with the corresponding period last year. It cannot be laid down, however, that the degree of safety on our roads is to be measured by the amount of money spent upon them.108. With regard to the specific projects mentioned by M,r.. Lloyd George for the construction of tunnels and bridges, the Government will favourably consider such of these as are found on examination to be practicable and desirable and to merit national assistance, and indeed they have already had many of them under consideration before the receipt of his suggestions.109. The Plans recall that schemes for electrification of suburban railways have been estimated as &apos;&apos; capable of utilising a total capital expenditure of  80 million to  100 million.&quot; Mention is also made at another point of the need for further tubes near London. The Government have only recently arranged financial facilities for tube construction, suburban railway electrification and other transport purposes in the London area at a capital cost of  35 million. This represents the largest scheme of urban transport development which has ever been envisaged within a similar period. There may be other plans of like character in the provinces justifying similar facilities. They have not as yet, however, been laid before the Government.110. The reference to air transport suggests other reflections. It has been the policy of successive Governments in the United Kingdom, whilst recognising to the full the great benefits which air transport can confer on the community, and the need for assisting it by grants from the Exchequer during the early stages of its develop-ment, never to lose sight of the necessity for continuous progress towards a commercial basis of operation. The very&apos; heavy losses sustained by the private investor and the lavish outpouring of public money on subsidies which have been seen in some other countries have been avoided here. These facts seem to be hardly appreciated in the Plans. But the Government need no reminder of the urgency of fostering air transport by all legitimate means. A new scheme for the far-reaching development of Imperial air transport was announced to Parliament at the end of last year and has since been under con-tinuous and active discussion with the Dominions, India and the Colonies.    This scheme provides for the  drastic curtailment of[11899] p 2
existing .time schedules, which in many cases will be more than halved;, for a. great increase in the frequency of services.; for the opening, up of new routes; and, last but. by no means least,, for the future transport of .alL first-class mail matter by air at the.existing Imperial postage rate, but with a reduced unit of&apos; weight-apostal development on a scale to which there, is as yet no parallel in any other part.of the world. Special enquiries have been instituted con-currently into, the improvement of the ground organisation of our Empire routes to fit them for night flying, and into the possibility of largely increasing the number of aerodromes and ancillary facilities in the United Kingdom, whilst, in addition, a strong Inter-depart-mental Committee has been set up to keep the whole question of the further development of air transport under constant review.111. The Plans suggest that the extension of Canal under-takings would relieve the railways of the burden of bulky non-perishable traffic. There is, however, little reason to suppose that the diversion of this traffic would be welcomed by the railways. Developments can, indeed, be suggested which deserve consideration by the interests concerned, but one at least of the two large proposals suggested seems to the Government to be altogether ill-conceived.112. On Docks and Harbours the capital expenditure in recent years under State-assisted schemes amounts to some  30 million. Other projects which might merit State assistance are under consideration, but are of comparatively minor scope.113. On the development of telephones, the document suggests no object which is not now being actively pursued by the Govern--ment, and in fact a three years&apos; plan involving an expenditure of some  30 million had already been put in hand before Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s proposals were made.114. The Government have recently announced the institution of a comprehensive enquiry into another subject dealt with in the document, namely, that of the distribution of electricity.115. The observations in the document on rural water supplies appear to take no account of the fact that the problem of defective rural water supply was attacked by the Government early in 1934. For England and Wales a million pounds of Exchequer money were made available for the service, over and above contributions from the rate fund. Grants have been provisionally allocated in respect of schemes for nearly 1,300 parishes, of an estimated total cost of  3 million; work is on hand also in nearly 300 additional parishes where an Exchequer grant is not required. The work of providing water in the country districts where it is needed is proceeding evenly and steadily. For Scotland a sum of  137,500 was similarly made available, and grants have been allocated in respect of 70 schemes, . the capital cost of which is estimated at  577,000. Work is proceeding or is about to begin on 26 other schemes without Exchequer assistance.116. Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s proposals for the reclamation and reconditioning of agricultural land have been mentioned in an earlier passage of this statement dealing with the agricultural question. The reclamation of land from the sea and the reconditioning of heath and marsh land are intrinsically attractive suggestions. But in view of the uncertain economic prospects of the land thus brought into use, the high cost and the additional burden on the taxpayer, the Government think it more important to devote Exchequer resources in the form of grants for arterial drainage operations to ensuring that land now under cultivation, especially in those parts of the country where land drainage is an essential operation, shall remain productive.
117. .&apos;The nature of these&apos; public &apos; works suggests a further reflection on the effect of the Plans on unemployment. The public works were -expected to provide direct, employment, on the site of the works, for some 550,000 workers suffering from periods of long-term Unemployment. The evil of &quot;long-term periods of unemployment, grave and-distressing as it is, is; mainly confined to particular areas in which export industries have been stricken down, by the world crisis.&quot; Accordingly, Mr. Lloyd George writes : V;,&quot; Preference will doubtless, be given to,those schemes which&apos; .can be put in hand near the districts where there are large numbers, of workless, to schemes which involve a high proportion of labour, and to schemes which draw their materials from industries that are in special need of stimulation.&quot;118. Unfortunately, this suggestion flies in the face of the facts. It is above all in those districts of the South and the Midlands where a growing population has gathered and long-term unemployment is least prevalent that public works on a sufficient scale can be usefully conceived. Nor do public works of any ordinary kind automatically supply orders to such trades as the mining, textile or shipbuilding industries, which are specially depressed. For these reasons the Government have to seek different measures for dealing with this problem.
SECTION IX.-MACHINEEY : THE NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT \       ./   board AND THE SUPEE CABINET.&apos; The Plans, by their proposal to create a National Development Board, and a Cabinet of Ministers mostly without departmental responsibilities, ivould tend to divorce policy from administration, and would introduce into the present system of government, a netu advisory body which would be unable to enforce its own recommendations. So far from conducing to rapid action these proposals would cause delay and confusion.119. From the preceding examination of the Plans, it is evident that they, rely essentially for successful working on the establishment of a new machinery of government. This new machinery consists of two parts. There is to be a National Develop-ment Board which will make a national survey, prepare plans for land development, the organisation of industry and the improvement of national services, and give advice as to the financing of its schemes. There is to. be a Cabinet of five Ministers none of whom (except the Chancellor of the Exchequer) would be in charge of a Department.120. To begin with the composition of the proposed Board, it would seem that the functions to be entrusted to it cover so wide a field and trench on so many departments of Government as to require almost superhuman qualities of wisdom, foresight, judgment, experience and technical acquirements in its members. The present Government, like their predecessors, are deeply indebted to many men and women distinguished in all walks of life who, assembled in Eoyal Commissions or Committees, have been asked to examine and advise upon important topics of the day. Many-State documents of first-class importance testify to the ability with which experienced outside judgments have illumined great State questions. But the members of every Government have had to recognise how difficult it is to find persons who, having the qualities required for these tasks, can also afford the leisure necessary to undertake the temporary burden of an investigation, even though limited both in scope and time. In the opinion of the Government, the task of discovering persons competent to undertake the functions assigned to the Board from among the classes named, persons who would require to have a working practical experience both of local and national administration if their recommendations were to have any value, would indeed be a formidable one. But assuming that the difficulty of finding the right personnel can be surmounted, the next question that arises is what powers are to be given to the Board to ensure that its schemes shall be operated. &quot;The Board,&quot; says Mr. Lloyd George, &quot;would be there to get things done.&quot; But it does not appear that it would have any power to get things done. It is &quot;to produce constructive and fruitful ideas,&quot; but these ideas are to be submitted to the Cabinet, and the Cabinet will only &quot; authorise such of the recommendations as it approved.&quot; It is impossible that any recommendation made by the Board should not affect some DeparS-ment, and &quot; Departments concerned .... would of course be given an opportunity of reviewing them and presenting their views on them to the Cabinet.&quot; Is it not inevitable that the Cabinet would attach more weight to the views of Ministers, based on the accumu-lated knowledge and experience of their departments , than to those of an external committee out of touch with the actual problems of administration? And, if so, will the Board acquiesce in the rejection of plans on which they may have spent many hours or even weeks of thought?121. In the course of the discussion Mr. Lloyd George was asked whether he contemplated that the Board would have the right to make public schemes which had been submitted to the Cabinet and rejected by them. It was not an easy question to answer, but if the Board is, as proposed, &quot; to avoid any entanglement in party-political conflicts,&quot; the answer must clearly be in the negative.   It can, however, hardly
be supposed that the Board, composed as it must be of persons of most outstanding authority and distinction, would consent to remain so muzzled. Yet if it were to be given freedom to express its views it would be.in a position to appeal to the public over the heads.of the Cabinet, and responsibility would cease to reside in those constitution-ally appointed to exercise it.122. The substitution of a small for a large Cabinet does not really simplify this dilemma. To some extent it would even intensify it. Mr. Lloyd George would create an external Board, of independent experts, whose resounding title and imposing functions cannot conceal the fact that the Board&apos;s proposals, when finally made, would have to be submitted to the Cabinet who, in turn, would have to submit them to the Departments. He would at the same time create a Cabinet which would have little more direct and daily contact with the Departments than the Board itself, with the result that the process of co-ordinating the Board&apos;s plans with the knowledge and activities of the Departments would be correspondingly protracted.123. This is not the place to argue the general questions of the relative merits of small or large Cabinets, and of the part which may be played in modern government by new statutory bodies. The Government have shown that they are conscious of the issues involved in the first question by their recent appointment of a special Committee of the Cabinet, which has the particular function of examining and reporting to the full Cabinet on questions involving&apos; long-range policy. They have equally shown themselves conscious of the value of statutory bodies, by the appointment of the Tariff Advisory Committee, as well as in other fields of administration. But it is clear that Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s proposal to create two bodies, both divorced from active responsibility for administration, is not the way to secure either a full and accurate survey of the nation&apos;s needs. or rapid executive action to meet those needs. It is clear also that no one statutory body could bear the weight of miscellaneous functions and universal responsibilities which the Plans seek to impose on the National Development Board.
SECTION X. CONCLUSION.124. Throughout this statement the Government have endeavoured to review Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s suggestions as possible contributions to the formulation of their future policy. They agree with him that any future policy for this country must be a policy of action. They were elected as a Government of action; they have been a Government of action; they are resolved to develop their action in the future, using every practicable means to further national recovery which will not undermine the foundations already laid during the lifetime of this Parliament.125. Consequently, in the course of their review, the Govern-ment have indicated, in a number of passages, some of the main lines upon which they have been acting or intend to act. At the Outset, they have expressed agreement with Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s general aim of reorganising and developing our national resources and improving our national conditions, and with his view that it is sound policy to utilise the depression for this purpose. They have made clear their conviction that much remains to be done towards these ends, and that finance need prove no obstacle to any sound schemes of expansion. Measures have been taken to check the decline of the rural population and to see that the agricultural industry is organised on new and more hopeful lines. In housing unexampled development has taken place and its pace and scale have been increasing, while the national town and country planning survey is also proceeding with increased momentum. Overseas trade has expanded and is still expanding under conditions of unprecedented difficulty. A comprehensive survey of colonial resources has been undertaken and completed. Reorganisation in various industries is increasingly fitting them to take advantage of these new opportunities. The concrete efforts undertaken and contemplated by the Government, of which some examples are given in the preceding pages, demonstrate their desire and will to utilise the present cheapness of money to further schemes of national development. The needs of the Special Areas, which Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s suggestions do not really touch, are the subject of a series of experiments which, if they have not yet succeeded in solving the problem, will nevertheless afford a basis for further measures of a different kind as experience is accumulated.126. This summary is, of course, far from exhaustive. A review of the present kind cannot be made the vehicle for a full, still less for a final, statement of Government policy. But it shews at least that there is a practical alternative to Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s proposals. In every field which he explores the Government have already taken action which has produced results wider, more comprehensive, and more beneficial than any that his programme can effect.127. &quot;The present feeling throughout industry and com-merce,&quot; writes Mr. Lloyd George, &quot;is one of apprehension. Progress where it occurs is slow and reluctant. The expectation which had begun to show itself a little while back that there would shortly be a trade revival, possibly amounting to a boom, has faded. People of an enterprising habit, who are disposed always to start their preparations well in advance when better trade is in prospect, are to-day holding back. They are afraid of what the future may bring forth in the shape of fresh depression.&quot;128. Mr. Lloyd George apparently believes that people can be shaken out of blank pessimism, not by the formulation of considered Government policy consisting of concrete measures, but by the establishment of some spectacular new machinery of government which is vaguely expected to evolve a whole new programme of national regeneration in a twelvemonth.129. The Government cannot accept either this picture of the present state of feeling in the country, or the conclusion Mr. Lloyd George draws from it. On the contrary, in spite of the disturbed conditions in other lands, they believe that confidence in the future remains firm and well founded. On this foundation a steady policy of expansion and social reform can be and is being built up.
