THIRD  REPORT.  SURYEY  OF  THE &quot;ECONOMIC  SITUATION,  MAY 1932.   BY our terms of reference we are directed to supervise the prepara-tion of periodical Reports on the economic situation: and in accordancewith these instructions we now submit the  second of these  periodical reports.   2.  In Section I we give a brief summary of the main changes inthe past two months,  and in  Section II we discuss certain  aspects ofthe present situation.   3.  The Report represents the general views of the  Committee,without attempting to express the different  shades of opinion held by individual members.                      (Signed on behalf of the Committee)                                             J.  C.

                I.-RECENT DEVELOPMENTS.    WE submit the following summary of the principal  developmentsthat have occurred in the economic situation since the presentation of our last Report.    2.   Sterling  at the time of. our  last Report  (8th  March) had just risen to a level of about $8&apos;67, to which point it  has returnedat  the,time of  reporting, after having  touched a highest point  of$8&apos;82  on New  York on the 28th March.  The return to the present level was probably due  to  the  withdrawal  of  speculative upwardpressure as  a result of the establishment of the Exchange Equalisation    3.   The trend of gold&apos; &quot;prices&quot; continues  downwards, though themovement has^een-le^uniform^ha^earlieHn^the -year;? \ American,German and Italian wholesale prices have fallen.  The French index-number, on the other hand,  has&apos;moved upwards  since the  beginningof February.  It is not clear how far this is due to the constitution ofthe index-number or  how far it is  the result of  increased  protectivemeasures.   Sterling   prices  have  fallen  substantially,   and the&apos;&quot; Economist &quot; index-number is now only  8 8 per  cent, above that for september  1981.    The  gold prices  of  commodities  dealt  in on international  markets   have  shown   a  more  pronounced   fall.Considering individual commodities, the price of wheat is, on balance,unchanged,  in spite of a sharp fall towards the end of March.  cotton and sugar are lower.  Rubber, after a fall early in March,  has  lately been  comparatively  steady.  Metals generally  fell  until the end  ofApril, though  tin has recently risen sharply on a tightening  up of therestriction scheme.   Price movements  this year are shown in thefollowing table :                             TABLE 1.                             Prices.September 18, 1981 = 100.Date.	United Kingdom.

The Federal Reserve Banks of  the  United States have  beenbuying securities on  a large  scale about  $100,000,000 a week inrecent weeks in pursuance of the policy of reflation.  To some extent the Member Banks have off-set the effect of these purchases by using the funds put at their disposal to  reduce  their indebtedness to theReserve Banks.  None the less, the total  deposits of the Member Banksincreased between the  7th  April  and  the 5th May  by  nearly$200,000,000.  There has been a further substantial fall in the valuescf common stocks, which are now worth, on the average, one-third oftheir value this  time  last year, and little over one-half of their valuesix months ago.   Bond prices have shared  in the  recent fall.   Theextreme  nervousness  of opinion in America has  been illustrated bythe reactions caused by the vagaries of Congress in regard to balancingthe Budget  and currency matters.   Both upon the rejection of the sales Tax and the passing of the Goldsborough-Fletcher Banking Billby the House of Representatives, there was a slump of the bond market and an outflow of short money from the  United States.   5.  There have  been declines, though on a smaller scale, in otherstock exchanges, as the outcome of the further  fall  of  commodity
prices.  The movements on the principal stock exchanges are shown.in the following table :                             TABLE 2.                       Prices  of Securities.(End of month figures.)

There has been a tendency towards lower short-term moneyrates throughout the world.  In London, Bank Bate was reduced from3i to 3 per cent, on the 21st April and to 2-*- per cent, on the 12th May.There have also been reductions of Bank Bate in a number of importantcentres, including Amsterdam, Berlin, Bome and Tokio.  Market rates-have been affected, the rate on  new Treasury Bills being now under one per cent., while discount rates in New York fell from 2J per cent.at the beginning of March to one to fths of one per cent, on the11th May.   7.  The French Budget has recently been passed on a basis which,.while nominally balancing, points to  a substantial real deficit.   Thelarge Treasury reserves of  a few years ago have been freely used to^support banks  and other concerns, to finance Balkan  allies,  public-works, &amp;c, and are now approaching exhaustion.   8.  The system of exchange  restrictions  remains substantially unchanged, but they do not appear to have been universally effective as-a means of choking off  imports.  There is a tendency (e.g., in Austria)to supplement them by import  prohibitions.  In France,  in  particular,there has  been a development of quota schemes which has served to-diminish French  imports considerably, a  reduction which has been seriously felt in Great Britain.   In  Great Britain there  have been substantial tariff increases  (including  those on iron and steel) as theresult  of   the  recommendations  of   the  Import  Duties  Advisory-Committee.   9.  The  position  in  Central  and  South-Eastern  Europe is-increasingly critical, and widespread default on foreign loans appearsinevitable. The shortage of foreign exchange in these countries is very-acute,  and shows no sign of diminishing.   The  attempt to create a-system of  mutual tariff preferences between the Danubian States, and;the recommendation of the League of Nations Financial  Committeethat fresh loans should be  made to the Governments of some  of theembarrassed European countries, have so far led nowhere.  There is a growing anticipation that depreciation, controlled or uncontrolled, willbe. resorted  to  generally  throughout Central  and  South-Eastern-Europe, in the place of the present attempts to maintain the currencyby artificial means.   10.  Production  and trade continue to decline in the world as a-whole.  Exports from  the United States, Germany and France showa falling-off in value for the first quarter of this year (as compared with1981) of 85 per cent., 81  per cent.*  and  37  per cent,  respectively.Exports from this country  declined in sterling value 11 per cent., orin gold value between  85 per cent, and 40 per cent.  In this country the improvement in employment noticeable in the last quarter of 1981has  not  been  maintained.   The  rise  in the  March figures  wa*-attributable largely to seasonal causes, and  in April  there  was  a   * This percentage takes no account of Reparation deliveries.[6990]                                               B 8

These figures suggest that while the  volume of employment-compares favourably with that of a year ago, the improvement occurredmainly in the latter months of last year.  The increase in employment which had occurred since September  1931 has been concentrated  (if-seasonal movements  are disregarded)  in metal  manufactures andtextiles.  The figures for April suggest that the  improvement in textilesis not likely to  be maintained.  On the other hand, again allowing foriseasonal changes, there have been considerable decreases  in employ-ment in building and public works contracting, distribution and other services  such  as transport, Government  employment and catering.In our last Report  we described the employment position as a conflict between the &quot; two opposing tendencies of diminishing employment inthe   sheltered  occupations,  and increasing   employment  in  theunsheltered,&quot; while expressing the apprehension that &quot; there is some-danger that the former may shortly prevail over the latter, since thepolicy of slowing down public works programmes has probably not, as yet, produced its maximum  effect upon employment; while exportingindustries may find the advantage which the  fall of the pound  gave them  increasingly  neutralised  by   the  operation  of  exchange restrictions, quota schemes  and higher foreign tariffs.&quot;   The  latest figures unfortunately confirm this apprehension.           II THE  INTERNATIONAL SITUATION.    12.  Having thus briefly reviewed the course of economic events in  the last  two months, we offer the  following observations on  the-economic situation in which we now find ourselves : -    18.  If it were not for the threatening international outlook, therewould be, we think, substantial grounds for confidence in the positionof  Great Britain.   The improvement in competitive power  in  world markets which our industries gained last autumn from  the fall of the pound, though tending to diminish as deflation becomes accentuatedin competing countries, remains as yet considerable; while the danger.;-of  an excessive and uncontrollable fall in the pound  has now beenvirtually removed.  The establishment of the Exchange EqualisationFund diminishes the risk that disturbing exchange fluctuations willoccur in future, and encourages the expectation, subject to the  possi-.bility of. a serious flight from the dollar which is remote for  the time
 being, that  any future movements,in the foreign exchanges will be such as not to embarrass industry severely.  We therefore welcome the establishment of the Fund, though the secrecy which is contemplated for its operations, if applicable not only to day-to-day  operations but over a longer period,  will make  it more difficult for us in future to appraise the drift of economic tendencies.     14.  Despite the depressing influences of the retrenchments  and increased taxes imposed last  autumn  in  order to balance the Budget, trade and employment, though  remaining at a very  unsatisfactory level, and without any clear prospect  of continued improvement, have at least improved  rather than  deteriorated during the  past  eight months, in  contrast  to a general deterioration in  other ^industrial countries.   Great  Britain is  almost the  only country in which there is np trace^of ,cligtrjusfc qf,,the stability, Qfith^ Vwfeingtsygtenh  Psycho- logically, there  is.a greater steadiness,and conjftd.enpe.jn business  and industrial circles in Great Britain than in most other countries.   We must  not ignore  the  danger of the policy  of public economy being carried by cumulative popular opinion to an injudicious and uneconomic point, thus slowing down the whole industrial machine.  Apart from this, if it were  not for the likelihood  of a further worsening of world conditions, there would be nothing in our internal conditions to  con- stitute a probable source of serious trouble in the near future.    15. Unfortunately,   the world situation  continues  to  deteriorate rapidly and alarmingly.  We dealt at some  length  in our last Report with the state of affairs in Central and South-Eastern Europe, which has since become increasingly critical, and which seems likely,  as we have already indicated, to give rise in the near future to widespread defaults and to currency depreciation, controlled or uncontrolled.   In  this Report we think it desirable to examine the peculiar and, in a different way, the hardly less critical situation in the United States.    16.  The  depression in the  United  States,  both  economic  and psychological, has now reached  a depth which corresponds to  the exceptional degree of her material expansion and  mental exaltation in the prosperity period.  The over-investment in buildings and plant had been carried to such lengths  during the boom that  it is harder in the United States even  than elsewhere to imagine how, for a long time to come,  the swollen  constructional  industries -can revive;  or how, without such  a revival, a reasonable state of economic activity can be restored.  An important section of the American banking system  has proved too flimsy to sustain a severe strain; and financial distrust, with its corollaries of a general  attempt to secure liquid positions and a dis- position on the part of the public to hoard currency,  has seriously accentuated the vicious circle of depression.  These phenomena were already manifest  before our  departure  from  the  gold  standard  last September.   Since  then the  United States  has suffered, in common with other gold standard countries, a material injury to her competitive position in world markets.   As a country  already highly Protectionist, she has not at her disposal the power of shifting even temporarily on to other shoulders part of the burden of depression by recourse to tariffs, while her large gold reserves and strong international creditor position have so far   cut her  off  from the relief  of  an enforced exchange depreciation.   17.  These circumstances  alone would make the task of breaking through the  depression very difficult; but  the difficulty  is greatly increased by the psychological condition  of  profound and  despairinggloom in which the American  business world is plunged. There is an extreme reaction against the shallow credulity which was so ready in the early phases of the depression  to believe on the slenderest grounds that the worst was past and that recovery was on the way. In its placethere is a general incredulity that anything which may be proposed canreally  succeed in turning the tide of trade.   Nor does the  prevailingpessimism stop there.   It extends to misgivings  as  to the stability oflaw and order, of the social structure, of American civilisation.   18.  It is against this gloomy and threatening background that theFederal Reserve Bank  authorities have launched their  policy of  the systematic  purchase of  Government securities at the  rate of  $100million dollars per week. These purchases should have  the followingbeneficial reactions on the economic situation.  If carried sufficientlyfar, they must increase  the cash reserves of the member banks, and
thus increase the power and the readiness of the banks to lend moneyto those who wish to borrow.   If the depression were less acute, this-might be expected to make directly for greater trade activity by stimu-lating traders to place orders, but as things  are,  this effect  may  beinappreciable.  There remain, however, certain indirect effects.   Inthe first place,  the process  should raise  the price  of  fixed-interestsecurities; for the ease  of borrowing is likely to induce  many people to buy securities which  they hope may  rise in price,  while the banksthemselves  will  buy securities, failing any other  outlet for theiradditional funds.  This improvement in the bond market may be atfirst confined to the most gilt-edged types, of-security, such as Govern-ment bonds ;*ibut as-these rise in prix;e;&apos;the ^upward&apos;movement may be-expected to spread to other types. - A- general improvement of the bondmarket would help t-h&amp;situation in.tlu-ee.way/Si:&apos; (i).it would^nerease thefinancial resources of some -concerns and individuals  whose solvencyis at present doubtful and thus help to  &apos;&apos; unfreeze &apos;&apos; frozen positions(ii) the consciousness on the part of the  holders of bonds that this partof their capital had appreciated would make for a more optimistic feel-ing on their part and a greater readiness to spend  in their capacity of consumers; (hi) a certain amount of new capital enterprise might  be stimulated if new bond issues could be placed on favourable terms.    19.   It will be evident from this account of the chain of conse-quences  involved that  the  situation  can only  be   improved. J verygradually by the policy that has been adopted.  At each  link in  thechain, time is required  for the cause to produce the  effect indicated,and,  under the  adverse  psychological  conditions which  have been described, the time  required may be very considerable.   Up to  thepresent the purchase of securities by the Federal  Reserve Banks hasbeen  reflected only very partially  in an increase in the cash reserves of the member banks, the latter having chosen to utilise most of  the-resources put at their disposal to reduce  then- indebtedness to  theReserve Banks.   So far, moreover, though the Federal Reserve Bankpurchases have served directly to increase the prices  of government securities,  there has been no tendency for this increase to induce a sympathetic improvement in the bond market generally.   There can,indeed,  be no doubt  as to  the helpful character of the influence of  the-Federal  Reserve Bank policy.  Even  if it fails to effect  a  positiveimprovement in the situation, it  may  be  of none the less value  in helping  to  arrest the process  of deterioration.   The  simultaneouspursuit of an easy money policy in Great Britain and in other countries will be likely, moreover, to increase  the effectiveness of the Americanexperiment.  None the  less, the tendencies making for  deterioration in the United States have acquired  so  formidable a momentum thatit is at present doubtful whether the policy of the large-scale purchase-of securities will succeed in turning round the tide of trade and prices.There is, indeed, always the possibility that disappointment with  theresults so far obtained may lead to a modification  of  the policy at  anearly  date.   20.   The policy of  credit  expansion  may perhaps  shortly   be supplemented by measures of a different kind.  It seems  not unlikely,.for  example, that  the  functions of  the Reconstruction  Finance-Corporation, which  at present  can only  make advances of  a type-calculated to thaw the frozen credit  position, may be extended in  the-near future so as to include  the financing of new capital enterprise,e.g ,  for railway purposes.  Loans may  also be made on a larger scale  to municipalities for the purpose of relieving unemployment.   Itis, indeed, conceivable that under the  pressure of popular agitationCongress might  throw orthodox financial principles to the winds and&apos;embark on lavish  schemes of public expenditure,  on,  for example, afurther  soldiers&apos;  bonus.   Measures  of  this kind would  increase  the-purchasing-power  of the  consuming public and  would  thus  have amore  direct effect on trade activity than can be brought about by  anabundant supply of bank credit.   21.   In this connection,  however, it is necessary  to consider  the-possibility of another development.  Important financial centres  inEurope  are distrustful of the course of policy in the United States, andon various occasions in recent months have tended to withdraw funds from  New  York in the belief that the  stability of the dollar  was  in danger.  So long as distrust of the dollar is confined to foreigners  the-
 -American authorities can safely disregard it, since the Federal Reserve &apos; System is effectively secured against the menace of an external drain ;by the Glass-Steagall Act.  Some recent incidents, however, such as  the slump on Wall Street when Congress rejected the proposed&apos; Sales  Tax, indicate the possibility that the nervousness as to the/dollar may ,at  any time spread from  the Continent to the American public.  If Congress were to indulge in policies which business circles regarded ;as  profligate  and irresponsible, a large-scale flight from  the  dollar  would be very probable.  Indeed, the mere  pursuit of the policy of -credit expansion to lengths which were regarded as  eccentric and unsound  might conceivably be  sufficient to induce such  a  flight.  It ruayihus.be  that the. American authorities are confronted with the dilemma &quot;that ^ any  action &apos;which  they take-Which &apos;is-&quot;sufficiently moderate not to cause alarm as to the dollar  will be inadequate to affect trade sand prieesy while. action-pow.euful..eiioughito o,-aise &quot;prices  would first entail general alarm as to the dollar,   i.,. &apos;.&apos;     22.  If at any time a serious flight from the&apos; dollar were to begin, it is probable that  the Federal  Eeserve authorities, in an  endeavour to  restore confidence, would reverse  their present policy of  credit expansion.  If they were supported in this  course by the Administra- tion and by public opinion and were to succeed thereby in checking the flight, the  position  would - then be  that  the policy of  organised reflation  would have been abandoned  as a failure, and the American people would  have  no prospect  before them but that of an indefinite - continuance of progressive deterioration.     28.  It may.be doubted, however,  whether the American people would for long tolerate a prospect so unilluminated by hope; and in these  circumstances  an  early  reaction to extreme  and  desperate measures  of public expenditure would be by  no means unlikely.   It is -necessary,  therefore,  to contemplate the  possibility,  although it seems at  present remote,  that  a flight  from  the  dollar may acquire such  momentum as  to  become uncontrollable,  with  the result  of -driving the dollar off gold despite the strong gold position of-the United States.  In this  event serious  issues  will  be opened  up  for  Great Britain.   We  have already referred  to the  likelihood of exchange depreciations in Central  and South-Eastern Europe.  Such deprecia- tions will deprive our industries of part of the relative advantage which they have gained in world markets from the fall of the pound.  Indeed, if the process of devaluation extends to Germany, the position of our industries vis-a-vis German competition  will be materially worse than it was last summer,  inasmuch  as Germany  has  effected drastic reductions in her costs of production in the-meantime.  If, in addition to Central and South-Eastern  Europe, the United States should -devalue her  currency, the consequences would  be still more far- reaching.   The sequel to  such  a development would probably be a period of  extreme exchange confusion, in  which the  whole of our present competitive  advantage  might  disappear,  and  which would probably   accentuate   the  growing  paralysis  of  the  processes  of international  trade.    24.  With the likelihood of unfavourable developments both in the United States and  in Europe,  and in the  absence of any really promising indications in  other parts of the  world, it is  impossible to entertain an optimistic view of the course of  trade  in Great Brtain. The outstanding moral of  this unprecedentedly  severe depression is the essential  interdependence of the economic  systems of  the different countries  of the world.  This interdependence is greater,  not  less, than it used to be in pre-war days, despite the growth of tariff barriers; and no country can hope to insulate itself  effectively or enduringly from dominant world tendencies.  It is improbable, therefore, if world- conditions continue to deteriorate, that we can retain for  long even the limited good  fortune  that we have enjoyed  during the past eight months, which is largely  attributable to a sudden and essentially precarious improvement in  our competitive power.   A world recoveiy is thus in our judgment an essential condition of any lasting improve- ment of British trade.   25.  We shall not attempt to discuss the problems that will come before the Lausanne  Conference,  upon  the satisfactory  solution  ofwhich much  depends.  There is, however, one subject  to which we desire to refer.
   26.   It is essential for world recovery to secure a quickening of the-flow  of  international  trade, and  this will require a revival of inter-national lending.   So far-as long-term  lending  is  concerned,  the-difficulties of the problem are immense.  It is very doubtful whetherit will prove practicable to-day to repeat the policy of the last decadeand organise long-term loans by creditor countries to the Governments-or Central Banks of the embarrassed debtor countries.   Except as partof a  constructive reform  scheme  calculated to  improve  both  the-economic and financial situation of the debtor countries, it would notbe justifiable to resort to this policy.  It would be merely throwing goodmoney after bad, since, with prices and  trade at their present level,the countries in question are already over-borrowed.  It is only for ascheme that included  arrangements  as  to  the existing debts,  the-removal of exchange restrictions, the reduction of tariffs and the con-sequent development  of new wealth: and industrial prospects that theprovision of new capital by the aid of external guarantees  would be-justified, though under these conditions, such a policy, if practicable,would be well worth while.   27.   When we turn to the provision of short-term  credits, we are-confronted with a problem which, though it bristles with difficulties, is,we believe, less fundamentally intractable.  The volume of the accept-ance credits by which a large part of international  trade is financed,and which is normally supplied in the main by the London market, has-rieclined seriously in recent months, and is, we believe, still continuing to decline.    This decline is  due  to  various causes,  prominent among&quot;them the desire of  London accepting houses to secure more liquidpositions and  the uncertainties  as  to repayment  arising  from  therestrictions on  exchange dealings which so many countries maintain.In these ways potentially sound current business is being increasingly;  -paralysed throughout  the world by difficulties arising out of past trans--actions:  We cannot believe that  it is necessary to acquiesce passivelyin this deplorable condition of things.   28.   We thus regard it as an essential and urgent,  requirement ofthe situation  to free  the processes  of international  trade  from the-impediments arising from the network of existing debt claims; and webelieve that the key to this problem lies in the more effective provision&apos;of short-term  international credits.   It is possible to imagine that ascheme  might be evolved \under which longer credits than are ordinarilyassociated with a certain type of trade might be granted in the case of exports  to countries which would agree to waive their exchange restric-tions in the case of trade so financed : and such an arrangement would:have much to commend it, if it could be made without worsening the-position of  existing credits.   We  hesitate, however, to make detailed:suggestions; but we think it is a matter  that deserves expert considera-tion.2,  Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,        May 25,  1982.
