SECRET. Copy No. 9.

CABINET

The Situation in Malta

Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

With reference to C.P. 172 (32), 174(32), and 177(32). I circulate at once the latest telegrams of today&apos;s date from the Governor of Malta, from which it will be seen that the Bishops&apos; Pastoral of 1930 has been superseded.

In view of the changed circumstances I have not thought it necessary to bring the question formally before the Cabinet again, and, after consulting the Lord President of the Council and the Foreign Secretary, I telegraphed today to the Governor  authorising him to proceed with the Election and intimating that I shall proceed with the Parliamentary Bill circulated in Committee of Home Affairs Paper 8(32). A copy of my telegram is also attached.
