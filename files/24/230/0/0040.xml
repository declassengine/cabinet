BALDWIN said he was greatly obliged to the Dominions/for coming to the meeting to discuss the questions before them.He would only ask that everything that ivas said would be treated in the utmost confidence.   Before actually proceeding to thediscussion of the matter in hand he would like to tell theCommittee in the greatest confidence that a statement was beingmade at four o&apos;clock in the House of Commons this.afternoon tothe effect that the Secretary  of State for Dominion Affairs andLord Hailsham were leaving for Dublin to-night for the purposeof a consultation with Mr. de Valera who had especially asked tosee representatives of the United Kingdom Government in regardto preparations for the Ottawa Confez-ence, and. that Mr. de Talerahimself was proposing to come  to London on Friday for further     ^consultation.   He would like  to preface his remarks by making-it quite plain that the question with which the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs&apos; Memorandum was concerned  (C.P.164(32) )had not been considered by the Cabinet.   It had  actually formed part of their Agenda but the full discussion had  been reservedfor tomorrow&apos;s meeting when the Cabinet would probably take adefinite decision of whether or not to proceed with the proposalto abolish naval and military  aviation, and to set up some
form cf control over civil aviation.    The Cabinet  might decide that it would be worth while tc initiate private dis-cussions with other important foreign Powers cr they might,on the other hand, come to the conclusion that the  proposaldid not offer sufficient grounds for any such preliminary discussions.   He was anxious that the Committee should clearlyunderstand what the position v/as.    He would also like to saythat he was, himself personally, extremely interested in thisproposal because he was the originator, and he thought it only fair to give the Committee the reasons which had prompted himto put forv/ard this suggestion.   He thought it aloe only fair to say that naturally his air colleague differed from him in hiopinion and that his other colleagues  on the Cabinet were entirely uncommitted.   The chief point which had induced himto make his proposal was profound dissatisfaction with theprogress of the Disarmament Conference.   It seemed to have get into a rut and to have developed into  a series of interminablearguments between technical experts, and he did not see thatthere was any hope of progress on these lines.   He had also for some time been most seriously alarmed at the tremendousgrowth in armaments since the War, and not only with the growthbut the frightful cost of armaments to all nations.   It seemedto him that nothing short of  disaster  would face the world ifsomething was not done and done at once.   He had reached theconclusions he had by a process of elimination and exclusion.He would like the Committee to realise that the last word hadnot been said in the documents before  them.   Obviously before any discuss:ons could take place, the  problem of what control was intended  as regards civil aviation must be considered, butobviously  something must be done to make quite certain that ifnaval  and  military aviation were abolished, civil aviationv/ould  not  become , instead the  focus of  the military danger.  lie
 just gave these first general impressions ?jo that they might all know what had been passing in his mind.     MR. FERGUSON said that his Government had advised him that they were not yot in a position to express any definite viewsbecause thoy were anxious to have time to study further theproposal,   Aviation was a most important consideration for canada in view of the extent of the oountry and was used for all sorts cf purposes^ not only for carrying passengers but also for carrying goods, for forest work, exploration, etc.   Some doubts had been expressed as to whether it was a practical proposition to introduce any form of international control of civil aviation in practice.   He would not say an3r more becausehis Government did not want to take up any position which wouldbo embarrassing to the United Kingdom Government.   He would like the Committee to understand that the Canadian Government were sympathetic with the United Kingdom Government Vs v.lews but &quot;that they were not in a position to express any definite opinion at  themoment.     MR. LATHAM said that he had heard from his Government but he was instructed to say that their views were purely provisional and tentative, formed without full Cabinet discussion and mightbe subject to variation.   His Government entirely agreed that if the Disarmament Conference was to be rescued, seme concreteaction must be devised as soon as possible and, subject to the               hadproviso which ho/made at the beginning of his statement,  hisGovernment were prepared to support the United Kingdom government proposal for the complete abolition of military and naval aviation.The reasons why his Government were prepared provisionally to give this support were based primarily on a  realisation of thefundamental importance of achieving some real results at  theDisarmament Conference.    They realised the  disastrous political                         &quot;3-
effect on all Governments if the Disarmament  Conferencefailed.   As regards air bombing,  his Government  realised the frightful menace to the civil population  and  to  london in particular, and they appreciated fully  the vitalimportance of London to the British Commonwealth.    HisGovernment also considered that air bombing provided adefinite threat to the Navy and also had considerable influence on the question of coast defence.    If  Air forces should be able to put London out cf action by bombing,  say,within a week, it would, be a poor consolation to  know thatwe should perhaps be able to do the same to Paris and Berlin.Therefore his Government was generally prepared to supportthe suggestion on general lines.
                                                             -     2S7     As regards the question of the control of Civil Aviationhis Government had not had time to consider the question in detailbut he would like to make a few personal observations.    He was veryimpressed by the arguments which had been put forward by the Secretaryof State for Air as to the impossibility of international control parti-cularly the point he made as regards the difficulty of divorcing fin-ance and control.   But he was wondering whether it v/as absolutelyvital to have some scheme of control for Civil Aviation.   Might it not be worth while to take the risk of Civil Aviation being developed for military purposes in view of the very great advantages of abolish-ing all other military flying or perhaps it might be possible to limit the quantity of Civil Aviation by some formula based, for example,on the real use of aircraft in hours and mileage in commercial trans-port;  some scheme in fact, which might prevent the collection ofcivil aircraft by any  one  country for improper purposes.   He put for-ward this idea for consideration because he realised the importanceof finding an answer to the Civil Aviation riddle.    The proposal fora political truce was also very important.    There was a further addit-ional political point which he felt might be valuable if advocatedat Geneva with strength and vigour, that was to say that we were verymuch against any xdea that the Conference should attempt to settle,for all time, the strengths of the various nations in accordance withthe idea contained in the Covenant of the League of Nations.   Hethought it would be a great help if the United Kingdom Government should express strongly their views on this matter.    The idea embodied inArticle 8 of the Covenant seemed to him to be quite impracticable oeTcause it would inevitably mean that all nations would be forced to putin demands for an ultimate maximum which were entirely divorced fromrealities.    It seemed to him that it might be a good thing to suggestthat any convention signed should be for a period of five years,  TDOSS-ibly with the addition of a further period  of   five years.    He thoughtit was this idea of fixing now an ultimate  maximum  which was frightening                               -5-

/the countries at              .the Disarmament Conference.   Australia, for example, had a pop-ulation of six and a half millions at the present moment hut someday this figure might easily he raised to thirty millions.   Thenagain, there was the very great difficulty, if not impossibility of defining ultimate strength.   It seemed to him impossible t^accept the idea of putting forward most extravagant figures.   Hethought that this proposal might be put forward as a major point.He would put forward the suggestion that the Secretary to theLeague should be asked to request from all countries new figures ona five year basis with, perhaps, tne addition of a further five years as well.    SIR. THOKKS WILFORD   said that his position was comparativelysimple in that his Government had given him instructions to supportany disarmament policy that might be proposed by the United KingdomGovernment.   His Government felt that, in the United Kingdom weremarshalled all the experts and they were prepared, therefore, tosupport anything which would tend to alienate the frightful amountof money which the V/orld was spending on armaments t^-day.   He had said already at Geneva that his Government were prepared tr suppoitproposals for the abolition of the submarines, bacteriological war-fare and air bombing.   He realised fully that there might be diffi-culty  in carrying out the United Kingdom Governments proposal and hequoted a letter he had received from a New Zealand officer servingon the North West frontier of India, which described how a disputehad been settled by the Air Force in a week which might quite easilyhave taken very much longer if tne Army had had to deal with it,     JThe United Kingdom Government would certainly have to take a greatrisk in abolishing military aviation but if they believed that some-thing  must be done in this direction his Government were preparedto support them.   He added that he had formed a very depressedview of the position at Geneva where he felt that France held allthe strategic positions and that there did not seem to be much hopeof progress as things were at the present time.                             -6-
                                                         ?r- ^                                                         hJ O     IviR.  te V/AT3R expressed himself in complete  agreement  with much of what SIR THOMAS GILFORD had said about the progress  ofevents at Geneva.,,   The idea of the abolition of Naval  andMilitary Aircraft was one which had been considered by  hisGovernment and. in which they were very interested.   Prom  cneaspect this question had been discussed in the  Committee ofImperial Defence and the views rf the Government of the Unionof South Africa had been put forward then in more general  terms.Now that the proposal was in concrete form,  his  Government hadcabled to say that the Scheme, as a whole, was  one whichcommended itself to them a geed deal and they thought that if itcould be made practicable, it would represent a  considerable advance in disarmament;  but his Government were net altogetherprepared to go so far as total abolition of all  naval andmilitary air forces.   They felt, perhaps, that  there might  be some device which could meet their difficulties.  The  Governmentof ^outh Africa command one squadron of aircraft.  This force was sufficent  to meet their needs at present and, so far  as could be seen, would be sufficient to meet their needs  for sometime to come.    It was required for peace purposes and  was particularly valuable in view of the long distances to  be  tra-versed and the semi-barbarous people which his Government  had tocontrol.
                                                 -     269                                                  ...     they   had found that aircraft provided the best methodof most easily preventing trouble.    He could not see thatthere should be any real difficulties in meeting hisrequirements, because they needed aircraft not formilitary but purely for police purposes, and he thoughtthat it should be quite possible to devise some systemof licensing which could meet the needs of     countries who were in a similar position to that of his own.    Ashe had said, his Government favoured the scheme itself and were prepared to support it.    In studying the variousdocuments, and in particular CP.-164 (32), he felt thatthey ought to be studied with the Air Porce documentsalongside.   There was, he felt, a great deal in theAir Porce contentions, and that much reliance should beplaced on them.   Tnere were practical arguments dealingwith this scheme which would certainly have to be met atGeneva.   The South African Government were consideringthe whole question and, as he had said, while they wereprepared to support the idea in general, they were notyet, he thought, sufficiently seized with the actualterms of the scheme.   They were anxious to know alongwhat lines it was proposed to control civil aviation.The South African Government were very definitelyagainst the international control of armies, as suggest-ed in the French scheme.   At the same time they wouldbe prepared to consider the question of the international control of civil aviation, but they would like more information.    In summing up, therefore, the Governmentof South Africa were prepared to support the UnitedKingdom Government&apos;s suggestion,  subject to the provisoswhich he had already given/
     Mr DULAWTY intimated that hi?. Government hadrot yet hp3 sufficient time to study the documents a? carefully as they iconic like.  As regards thegeneral principles, his Government were in generalagreement in so far as they had considered the matter at present, without, however, in any way committing themselves  on the question of the control of civilaviation.     SIR SAMUEL HQARE, at Mr Baldwin*s request, saidthat he had found it difficult to distinguish between himself as  a former Secretary of State for Air andas Secretary of State for India, but he would endeavourto hold the halar.ee as evenly as he could.  Fe hadtalked to the Aga Khan, who was his representative atGeneva, and he had also had correspondence with theGovernment  of India, and was now waiting for a- more detailed answer to a cable he had sent a short time-ago.  Without, perhaps, being in full possession ofthe Government of  India&apos;? detailed views, he mightdescribe the position  of  India  generally a? follows.Civil aviation in  the  future would,  play a big partin the life of India.  &quot;he first  Imperial Air Routehad been to India .  Fe had already  said, and he would say again,  that he  felt  that  once  the question  of controlling civil  aviation was  full;.,  examined  itwould be  found impracticable.   There were a  grea^tnumber  of difficulties to be  overcome,.such  as  thequestion of quotas,  subsidies,  and. so  on;   and,  above all  thing?, he  felt,  the question of  safety.  Fe addedthat  he  himself  would he most  iinwilling to  have toflv  in machines  belonging to civil air  lines  ofcertain countries.  In fact,  the more this  questionof internationalising and. controlling civil aviation                        -Q-
                                                     *J p. 0                                                     A* Uwas examined the more  impracticable did he think itwould become.   further, from experience at Geneva,he could visualise that this question might lead tointerminable wrangles  as to what lines were to be developed, what subsidies were to be paid, whatstandards of manufacture were to be maintained, andso on.   He wondered whether it might not perhaps be possible to do some.th.ing by means either of publicityor on the lines suggested &quot;by Mr. Latham, but he could not help feeling that the  idea set out in the ForeignOffice Memorandum was  not practicable.   As regardsmilitary aviation, he  could not possibly give socategorical a negative as in the case of civilaviation.   As a matter of fact he had always feltthat if there were no  flying and no military aviation,  Ithe British Commonwealth would be in a much stronger position to-day than it actually was.   It seemed tohim that it could be accepted that on the whole thenew arms and weapons,  such as gas, aviation and submarines, had tended to weaken the position of theBritish Commonwealth in relation to other Great Powers,and if the sum total was added up, even allowing for thesplendid record of the flying services, it would befound that on the whole flying had perhaps done more harm than good.   But  he would add that this might not always be so.   The Royal Air Force had shown, not onlyin India but in the Middle East and other places,  howvery useful it could be, and in the last ten years there was not the slightest doubt that Royal Air ForceAction had saved much  loss of life and considerable expense.    On the .whole he thought that, contrary  toexpectation,  the Royal Air Force had proved to be  muchmore humane than the older methods of warfare,  whichoften involved long campaigns,/
  long columns, many casualties and much sickness.  It seemed to him that Vr Te Fater&apos;3 suggestion regard-  in?- a Police Pores vas an idea that was worth explor-  ir.g, because India had a problem not at all dissimilar  to that of South Africa.  It would not be easy, and  he could ?ee that supposing the Government of South  Africa were allowed to have a Police Fo^-ce, then  France would at once  claim to have a Police Force in  Worth Africa.  Such a Force could, quickly be  transferred to Europe in case of necessity.  Fe  would like fur the&apos; to say that, if there was really  a question of abolishing military aviation altogether  and s o &apos;tay in g I.or^or. mu eh 1 e? s vuInevab 1 e, he v. o u 1 d.  not set up these arguments of his against these  advantages.  Fe might perhaps be a pessimist, hut he  found great difficulty in believing that the great  European Powers   even Italy, who had already put  forward a suggestion on these lines   aeulrt agree toany                                                     / / sr oh  proposal.  Fe did not think that France or the  United States or Japan would be willing to accept our;  idea,  njhen; again, there was the very Important  question that if we made this proposal it might react  adversely on the moral of the Air Force.  If the  proposal were carried., then  of course  it would, not  matter.  Put supposing the proposal was made and .  was  reiected, then he thought it  might strike  at the  foundations  of the moral of  the Air Force, which  at  the best  of times were very sensitive.   In  other  words, we  should have created a  pood  deal  of harm  and  done very little  rood.   Therefore, before  giving  any  definite answer er  on  this  question,  he  thought it  most important that  we  should take  the same  action  with the great foreign  Pov ers as  ve were  doing with   the Dominions:   that is  to pay,  we should  consult
them beforehand.  If re found, as the result of these discussions, that, the world &quot;is ready to accept our pro-posal, then we could ro ahead;  tut if not, he -Pelt itwould he quite fatal for us to make this suggestion.     Mr BALDWIN, in answer to a point, made by Lord London-derry, said that, he entirely agreed that the general idea was to explore any possible avenues which might lead to a successful issue at the disarmament Conference.  He realised that sufficient time had not been available for the full examination of this proposal, end he quite agreed that itmight be necessary &quot;por further consultations to take place before a fine.], decision v-ns made.  After listening to thediscus?ion, however, he thought he ^ould not be far wrong in summing up that at the present stage the Dominions were inclined in principle to support, the United Kingdom in theline they might decide to take,  ^hus, if, when the matter had been fully examined, the Government decided to putforward their proposal, they Would he prepared in principle to give their support.  On the other hand, if the UnitedKingdom Government finally decided that it was not practic-ahle to go forward, with this proposal, then he gathered.that the Dominion Governments would adopt the same attitude.     (This statement met with  general acceptance.)     Mr piFElGTJOON asked that the Dominions might be kept inthe very closest touch with rhat the United Kingdom! Govern-ment was doing, and that no decision would be taken withoutfurther c o n s u It a t i o n w 11 h th em.     Mr BALDWIN said that iJ&quot; it was. decided to consult with  other- Governments,  then  certainly the dominions would,  be advised .   If, after  this,  it was  decided,  togo  on  with  the  proposal  at Geneva,  then again theDominion Governments would he  inf cmred.,   On the  otherhand,  if the Cabinet decided  that  they were not  prepared at  the present,  moment,  to  consult  any  foreign Governments,then  this  information would  also  be given  to  the                          -IS-
Dominionso   He wished, however,  to make it quite clearthat the United Kingdom Government were not in any waywishing to commit the Dominion  Governments.     LORD LONDONDERRY said that in his Paper his technical advisers had shown the  great difficulties of any formof international control of civil aviation, and in hisforeword he had shown that he v/as opposed to the who lemethod of procedure at Geneva.   He was extremely sorry to see the idea cf abolishing naval and military aircraftsuggested.   It seemed to him, when one looked at the various international undertakings (Locarno etc.) and realised that perhaps seme nations were not prepared to implement them,how much less hope would there be of the implementing of anytechnical proposals,   He could not in fact understand theidea that we should divest ourselves of a technical weaponwhich, if war did occur, was the most up-to-date.   then there was another point.   He could not help feeling thatthere was a danger that we might quite deliberately prejudice our position in the councils of the world by divesting our-selves of our air forces.   He thought that no-one woulddeny that the position of a great nation did depend to someextent on the forces which lay behind.   Then there was alsothe question that if this idea was put forward it might havea very grave effect on the morale of the Air Forces, - a point which Sir Samuel Hoare had already made.   It seemed to him that our air forces, and in fact all our armed forces, mightlose their confidence in the Government,   His personalposition was that he would of course acquiesce in any decisionof His Majesty&apos;s Government, but if this proposal was putforward seriously at Geneva, his position would, become un-tenable*   It seemed to him, in view of the general politicalsituation, that the idea of divesting ourselves of certainweapons was very premature.
9 C (ih w -J     MR.THOMAS    said he wwuld  like to  ask if  the Dominions could apply  themselves  to  the following  problem, whether  the Cabinet did  e;r not.    Supposing it was  agreed that there should be inter- national Control  &quot;tf  Civil Air Forces with some proviso  regarding the  maintenance of a Police Force, would flying between two or more parts of  the British Commonwealth  be regarded  as exempt from international control to the  same  extent  as flying within one  part where each  Dominion would exercise  its own control over its  own civil  aviation?     MR.FERGUSON   said that conditions varied so very greatly in different Dominions and Canada  put her air  force to very varying uses.   Canada had found her air force  so vital to  her development that she was increasing it year by year.   The question was whether it would be desirable ^r even possible  to put  the control of  such an organisation into other hands.     MR. BALDWIN  suggested that a good deal of ground would  have to be  covered before Mr. Thomas1s  question needed consideration.     MR. LATHAM   said that if  any far-reaching proposals, such as the abolition  of  naval and military  air forces,  were to be adopted, he wondered whether it might not be a help to associate with this proposal one to the effect that the  personnel who would thus be deprived  of  their livelihood w&amp;uld be  looked after.   He thought perhaps that such an idea  might help to maintain the morale of the Services.     SIR SAMUEL HOARE    said that this was  not quite the point,   ) because if any uncertainty were to be created  then  it would more or less stop automatically all  recruiting.     MR. BALDWIN   said that it was certainly  an obvious point and  one which  would  have to be  gone inte, that the  men who were thus thrown out of woric would have to be properly provided for.     LORD SNOWDEN.   suggested that developments in  civil&apos;aviation might  absorb the  personnel thus deprived of  work, and he instanced                               -14-
tr-1 V ithe growth of civil aviation in the last twenty years.     SIR SAMUEL HOARS:   however, did not think that civilaviation could possibly begin to give employment to the greatnumbers who would thus be deprived of their livelihood.     MR. te WATTR   suggested that the armies would have to beso increased, if air forces were abolished, that all surpluspersonnel would be absorbed.     MR. FERGUSON   said that from his reading of the dccu-ments he felt bound to say that the weight of argument was against the proposal.   At the same time, in order to be ableto put  the position before his Government, he would like to hear views in support of the proposal.     MR. BALDV/IN   Said that as a matter of fact he had re-frained so far&quot; from doing this, in view of the fact that theCabinet had come to no decision.     MR. FERGUSON;-,  said ho would be very glad if such viewscould be expressed, so that his Government cfuld have full information.     SIR JOHN SIMON&apos; said that he would like to make it quite clear that the document, although issued by the Foreign Office,was issued in this way as a piece of machinery, and should beregarded rather in the light of a test, rr an enquiry,  than an expression of decided views.   It was very important, however,he felt, that the Committee should realise the steps whichhad led to this proposal being considered.   He would be glad?to explain some of the considerations which had led up to thissuggestion, but he would emphasise that he felt it was very important that the whole scheme should be considered deliberatelyand impartially, and that the arguments -pro and con, , shouldbe given the fullest weight.   Broadly speaking, the arguments which had led up to the present position were as follows:-
ej O O Firstly the manifest futility of the proceedings  at  Geneva  during the last four months.    He referred to the  scheme which was put forward by the United Kingdom Delegation, with the full support of the Dominions,  and which was eventually  carried,  that is the proposals for qualitative disarmament which did very useful work, but these questions had been handed over to technical connittees,  and it seemed to him that if this procedure was to continue to  be  adopted there would be little hope of getting any results at all.    In fact if any other large political proposals were to be handed over  to technical committees in the same way, nothing would  be  done. Secondly, some effort to produce really concrete  results from the Disarmament Conference was of overwhelming importance if any answer was to be found to the vital problems of reparations and economic recovery;  and also to our future  relations with the United States.   If we have to look forward to Lausanne with the example of Geneva an abject failure, what  is going to happen? The difficulties at Lausanne will be greatly increased.   No accommodation will be offered for the disproportionate distribution of armaments in the ^orld, Germany would be bound under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, while France  and other  countries would be free to continue to arm to any extent they  liked.   Every- one admitted that the economic position was desperate enough,  and if it should prove impossible to get any plan for the limitation of expenditure on armaments, it would become still more desperate.Then what will happen at Washington?  Even  if it should be possible^ to get agreement in &quot;Europe, no agreement would ever  be got  with the United States, with the failure of Geneva behind.   How will it be possible to induce the United States to fall in and  help if it has to be reported that the disarmament position in Europe is hopeless. Then there was a third point;  are we prepared to accept what  are undoubtedly very great practical and technical objections as being conclusive reasons for rejecting the whole  plan before we realise what the future dangers of the world will be if military aviation is allowed to persist?   The fact remained/                                -16-
                                                                c ftthat unless something was done,  and done now,  to stop this  menace,the prospect in future for the world was appalling,  particularly to citizens in crowded places.   As had been said by Mr.  Latham,London was in an exceptionally vulnerable position,  and it  was nottrue he thought to say that Paris and Berlin were in relatively asbad a position as London.   If civil and military aviation  were ina position to do what they could do now after fifteen or sixteenyears evolution, what were the prospects fifty years hence?   That,in fact, was the big issue which was making them all so much con-cerned to get some remedy.   The question was how best to approach the problems.   No one would expect there would not  be difficultiesconnected with this idea, but he thought that it must be regardedas a fundamental question for the future of the human race, and,therefore, he was perhaps unable to understand why anyone shouldtake up the attitude that they were not prepared, to  agree to theabolition of naval and military aviation because there were diffi-culties with regard to the control of civil aviation.   The question was therefore whether the difficulties connected with any inter-national control of civil aviation were so final that it would bepossible to say that it was useless to proceed with  the whole scheme;and it was on this proposal that the Dominions had been asked tomeet and exchange ideas.   At each stage every effort had been madeto find a plan, and he had done his best to keep in  touch with theDominions representatives at Geneva.   The present plan had emergedas a result of our being forced to reject a number of smaller plans.He had very much liked the idea which he had put forward to theCommonwealth Delegation at Geneva for the prohibition of the act ofdropping bombs,   This suggestion had been agreed in principle hethought by the Dominions, but the Air Ministry had put up very seriousconsiderations which had shown that it was no good proceeding withthis point alone.   A special committee had been set up to  considerthe matter, and had come to the conclusion that  by itself it couldnot do what was wanted.    This conclusion was  reached largely  because,
                                                              &amp; i -fj although bombing aircraft  would presumably  have teen  abolished, other  kinds of aircraft  wculd be kept  intact,  and when  war broke  out,  temptation  to use  them for  Lsuiting  would probably be  overwhelming.    Furthermore,  by scrapping our bombing aircraft we should gpavely  prejudice  our  own position, because the  amount  cf other aircraft  left to us  would  Vie comparatively small, while France with her  large army  would  be entitled to  have much larger forces altogether.  The-se arguments had  appeared very powerful, and so  the;/  had  been  driven  to considering  a  new plan, and  while he fully admitted and  realised the limitations of this plan and was not  in the  least unmindful  of  the difficulties of controlling civil  aviation, the  real question  v/as whether on balance  we  were prepared to see  the Disarmament Conference fail, rather than that we  should consider  this  cr some other plan,  even though,,  from our point of  view,  it might be difficult,  or even entail some  hardship.     MR. FERGUS8ON  said  that he  thought  in any case we  should get back to  the  fundamental  principle  that the Covenant provided  na- safeguard once war  had broken cute     SIR JOHN SIMON  said that that was why they had come to theconclusion  that the  only course would be  to scrap naval  and militar;aviation altogether.   Half measures could not possibly  be effective.   As regards  civil aviation,  while  quite understandingLord Londonderry&apos;s position, he thought  that perhaps theAir Ministry Advisers had not quite understood the  ForeignOffice Memorandum.   A number of very able paragraphs had been written by  the Air advisers on the basis  that  the idea v/as toestablish an  international  c-smmercial company,  and -they  had stressed the  idea  that if  this was done  then it might involvedivorcing control from finance, which would obviously present anumber of difficulties.   As a matter of fact this was  not theidea which underlay the Foreign Office - suggestion.    Naturallytheir proposals had not been vnrked out  in any det-ail,  but ifhe  followed  the suggestion correctly,  he thought  it  meantnot so much controlling  as/     -18-
regularising ana supervising ths idea being, that there vvoulc be anaareed distribution oi numbers as betv/een countries,- and so on.  Herealisea that there mi^ht be difficulties, out he thought th at txie.ywould certainly be less than under any idea oi one internationalcompany.  It was inevitable, he thought, that some iorm of supervision add regulation v/as required, one ^Iso it would  be important to ensure that the distribution of existing aircraft between one area of the Wcrlo ana another was not too disproportionate, anathe question was whether this idea was sufficiently practicable for us to pursue an.  try and work out successfully, rather  than to     it.reject/as making the whole proposal too difficult to proceed.
He noticed that the Air Ministry did not express the viewthat either France or the United States would necessarilyreject the proposal, hut ii&apos; on reflection in the Cabinet andin consultation with the Dominions there was sufficient feelingcf the enormous importance of getting this plan through ifpossible, then it might be worth while making inquiries both from France and the United States.   naturally the idea wouldnot be put forward if there would he no hope tf its being accepted, but he could not help feeling most frightfullyoppressed with what might happen unless this plan or some other of an equal calibre was put forward.    In answer to a question by Mr. Ferguson he said that the idea of an internationalcompany was not really in their minds.   Speaking very generally,he said that he thought some form of control of licences?numbers of aircraft etc. with right of inspection offered themost promising lines, but there was no idea of any internationalownership.  He again emphasised that these were suggestions which were being put forward with a view to trying to clear the-air .     SIR THOMAS WILFORD wondered whether it would be possiblefor Sir John Simon to take the same line with the Dominionsas he took in regard to the resolution on qualitative disarma-ment.   In that case previous confidential conversations hadtaken place with the United States and Italy, but not with france.   These conversations had been most successful.     SIR JOHP&apos; SIMON said  that in regard to this particular question he thought it would be essential for us to consultFrance beforehand.     LORD LONDONDERRY said that Sir John Simon knew how muchhe appreciated his  difficulties and that he did not disagreewith him  in the matter of the principle of trying to find a                          --80-
                                                            9 **? 1solution to the deadlock at Geneva,  but there were two things which he v/ould like to say.    As regards civilaviation, he did not think that anyone knew        how farinternational control would really  mean anything.   He wouldalso like to know how it would, be possible to control civilaviation without stunting its growth, and it seemed to him that it was not possible to contemplate artificial restric-tions of this kind which would interfere with the liberty cfthe private individual.    The abolition of military and navalaviation must depend, he thought, on finding some method gfcontrol of civil aviation which did not seem to be in therealms of practical politics.   He  was not at all sure thatthe Foreign Secretary was not flying rather high.   Big re-results were often built out of a number of small beginningsand, after all, the Disarmament Conference was only at thevery start of its work,  and he thought that perhaps some ofthe other proposals on page 11 of CP. 16 4(32) might moreconveniently be brought out.   He thought that the mostimportant thing perhaps was the political truce.     MR. BALDWIN said that it might be useful if the HomeSecretary, who was  connected with the work of Air raids precautions, could  tell the Committee what was happeningin foreign countries.     SIR HERBERT SAMUEL said that he was, ex officio, Chairmanof the Air Raids Precautions (Policy) Sub-Committee underwhich worked the Air Raids Precautions  (Organisation) Sub-Committee, The Chairman of the latter was the Permanent UnderSecretary  of State  for  the Home Office who had recently  submitted a personal Report.   This Committee had been receiving latelya number of  Papers  which  strikingly  supported what the foreign secretary had  said  in regard to the appalling consequencesif  something was not done to/                           -SI-
restrict future war in the air.    Be ports were to hand showing that France had worked out a complete scheme for the whole country for the defence of the civil population against air attack and was shortly to issue an extensive pamphlet on this matter:Germany had recently held exercises with the civil population inMunich:;  Italy was passing legislation for the sale and productionof gas masks;  the Dutch General Staff were much concerned  withthe question of the protection of their civil population and sowas Japan.   His Committee had been advised that in a war with france, London might he subject  to the following scale of attack.In the first 24 hours a hundred  tons of bombs which might cause5,000 casualties;  in the second 24 hours, seventy five tons of bombs which might cause 3,750 casualties;  and for each subsequent24 hours for an unlimited unknown period, fifty tons of bombscausing, 2,500 casualties.   Ho estimate of gas casualties had been attempted,   The Committee were  now about to undertake thepreparation of a detailed scheme for the evacuation of somemillions of people from London,  for the most part women andchildren at the outset of a war, but there was no guarantee thatsuch action could be taken before the attack was launched.    Thereport ended by saying that before long it would probably benecessary to prepare a big scheme for London and the Provinces andto inform the population what was being done in the same way asin France and Germany,   In these circumstances he thought  thatstatesmen ought not to be deterred by technical difficulties inconnection with civil aviation or be put off by questions ofpolice control in the north-west frontier of India or other places,but rather they should set to work with a view to overcoming these difficulties.   He would even go further and. say we ought not to let any Power veto these proposals in advance and should makeit clear to the whole world that the responsibility wouldnot be ours if they were turned down.   We would be willing to
do our share and it seemed to him that if such a statement were put clearly before the world, public opinion wculd be somobilised that even if results could net be achieved at once,any dissentient countries would be so affected by public opin-ion that the result would be achieved at a later stage.   he felt that the Government ought to proceed with the proposal and not be deterred by the various difficulties which wouldcertainly be raised.     LORD HAIL8HAK said that he fully realised Lord Londonderry&apos;spoint that the Disarmament problem was being approached from the wrong end.     (Mr. Thomas left the meeting at this point.)     He agreed there was a good deal in that point but he did notthink that in view of the present situation it was any good going on a line of this sort.   The Disarmament Conference had been in session for four months and therefore we were committed  to the attempt to disarm, but he did not think that anyone who had beentc Geneva could have formed any other opinion than that the situ-ation generally looked very bad, and if the Conference did not succeed, then the Foreign Secretary had told them what might happen,He was quite appalled at the risk which failure might have, notonly to the British Commonwealth but to the world at large.   Every-one would certainly at once attempt to re-arm;  Germany and Francew-?uld resume their old competition, and the effect on the United3States would be disastrous.   The only thing that might stop theworld re-arming would be that it would go bankrupt first:  in fact,the prospects would be extremely bad, and if this diagnosis was correct, then it was of vital importance to find some means of achieving real disarmament.   It seemed to him that there were two questions which ought to be asked in regard to the proposal underconsideration.   Firstly, whether it would be a good thing to do,and secondly, if so, is it hopeless and not worth trying?   On                           -23-
9 -&apos;&quot; ft4o ithe first question Lord Londonderry had said definitely he didnot think it v/as a good thing to do because we should have thegreatest difficulty in policing our frontiers.  His technical advisers in the Var Office did not consider this to bean insuperable objection.     Then, apart from the questionof the frontier, there was the question whether other nationscould be trusted or not.    He was prepared to agree that intime of war every country would use whatever weapons it could,but surely it would be an advantage to stop the work of prepara-tion in peace time?   At the present moment this competition in armaments led to the danger that one Power, fearing another and having accumulated a large forces might attempt a knock-out blow, and if it v/as possible to eliminate perhaps the easiestwaj/ of delivering a knock-out blow, then surely this was a bigstep in eliminating the risk of war altogether;,   Also, it was quite true, he thought, that if war broke out, then countries would improvise,but If  improvisation v/as necessary, then he thought we had already shown many times before that we were as good, ifnot better than others.,   Then Lord Londonderry had said we mightweaken our influence in the Council of Notions.   This would be true if we were unilaterally to disarm our air forcen, but if all other countries abolished their air forces as well, he didnot see that .our position could be sensibly weakened at all.Finally, if military and naval aviation was not given up, then there was the q\iestion of the civil population.   He honestlyfelt that this menace from the air was one of the greatestfears that was frightening Europe at the present time.   Theresults of bombing were perfectly frightful and anything thatwould tend to reduce or get rid of this menace would be a tremend-ous relative gain for the British Commonwealth.   London, asit had already been pointed out,  was particularly vulnerable,and if we got rid of this risk to London then he thought
I:&apos; i tlit would be in reality a great access of strength forus.    Therefore, on the general question of whetherthis plan would be a good thing to do, he thought the answer was certainly,  Yes.      The second question was whether it was worth while trying.    It had beensuggested, firstly, that it  would not be worth tryingbecause it might upset the morale of the Serviceif it was not accepted.     So far as the army was concerned the War Office did not agree with thispoint of view but he realised that there was a risk andtherefore he thought that we should not be in anyhurry unless the prospects were sure, but that weshould sound other Powers before we made any publicpronouncement.   He entirely agreed that theremust be a scheme to provide  for personnel, who wouldbe thrown out of work.    He realised that there v/ould be difficulties in dealing with civil aviation, but he did not think these difficulties were insuperable,and in any case did not think they should be allowedto weigh against the counter advantages.    he therefore supported the proposal and suggested that weshould examine the question  with other Powers.
     SIR BOLTON EYRES-MONSELL said he agreed very largelywith what Lord Haileham had said.    The first question to tacklewas one which Sir John Simon had also raised, i.e.,  was there any real opposition from other countries to this proposal.Then the question of the value of making a gesture in thisdirection would have to be weighed up against the possible lossof morale in the Royal Air Force and he agreed that  this was amost important question and finally it must be decided if such a gesture was worth while.    Then obviously, every step would haveto be. taken to alleviate hardship to the members of  this Force.The second question - is it a good thing to do?   From the pointof view of morale in Europe he thought that it would have a very marked effect.   He firmly believed that fear of being bombedout of the unknown v/as one of the strongest causes of increasein armaments.    Speaking from the purely Admiralty  point cf viewthey came to the conclusion that, on the balance, it would beto our advantage to abolish naval and military flying.    against this proposal were the three reasons put forward byLord Londonderry.     First, as regards Civil aviation, he agreed he could see great difficulties and then there wasthe question of policing and  here, again, he agreed that thesituation would not be easy and this was one which particularly affected the Dominions.     This question would require very careful study but he did not think that the whole proposal should be allowed to be affected by the aspect cf policework on the North West Frontier or on the Iraq.   Then the thirdpoint which was that countries would start improvising bombingmachines.   The Admiralty had put forward a paper on that subject and their views were largely in agreement with those of&apos;Lord Haileham.    Although it was possible this might happen,he thought the difficulties of bombing would be vastly increased if all bombing machines had been done away with.   There would
be no trained personnel and without training it would bedifficult to make bombing effective and, finally, he agreed thatif it came to a question of improvisation, we were just asgood, if not better, than anyone else.     LORD SNOVDSN   said he was very much in agreement with what Lord Hailsham had said and he also felt that the Committeeshould be influenced by the point which had been made so oftenthat the consequences of failure at Geneva would be so appallingand that to avoid these consequences, it was most important to make a bold gesture.   The World was expecting such a gestureand wo.ild regard any outcome from Geneva which fell short ofsuch an expectation as tantamount to failure.   Everyone hethought realised the difficulties but these difficulties shouldnot be allowed to prevent us putting forward our proposals.We must face up to the facts and take a bold line.   He was al-so very much impressed with what Sir Herbert Samuel had said,particularly in regard to the education of the civil population.in various countries to the possibilities of air attack.   it seemed to him that this education must be having a most terrify-ing effect on all people and if anything of this kind was pro-posed in this country then there would be a big public demand at once for the abolition *f military aviation.     MR. LATHAM   said that, if the United Kingdem government decided to proceed with this proposal, then he suggested that theymight associate with it a statement of the inevitable alternatives,not as a threat, but as shewing to the World what would be theresult ^f failure.   The United -Kingdom Government, he suggest-ed, might state that, if their proposals were not adopted, thenthey would feel bound to proceed with vigour to augment theirAir Force.   He thought,that such a proposal would certainlytend, to assist on the question of morale, and, secondly, thatthe Government would feel bound, to initiate the/
most extensive means of protecting their civil population.It seemed to him possibly, that, if stated frankly in thisway the proposal was more likely to be adopted.     SIR JOHN SIMON, in answer to a question from Mr.  Fergusson,suggesting that an alternative might be to abolish all bombing and to have inspection to see that no preparations were beingmade, said that this question hac already been investigatedand that he had been very much attracted by the  idea ofprohibiting the act of bombing.   They had come  to theconclusion that, by itself, this proposal would  be ineffectivebecause it was not only bombing machines that could drop bombs.Even if bombing aircraft were cancelled, there would be a much larger aggregate in Europe of potential bombers.     LORD HAILSHAM said the Foreign Secretary would remember that the Disarmament Committoe had arrived at a  decision onthis point solely on the opinion of the Air Service,    his department had not been able to express their views although,as a matter of fact0 they took the opposite view to theAir Force.     MR. BALDWIN said that he thought that the Committeehad now had all the arguments and he hoped they had all been as interested in the discussion as he had been.     It was ofsuch importance that a -close precis would be made and it v/culdbe circulated to all for record purposes.     LORD LONDONDERRY said he hoped the discussion would bekept most secret and he was very anxious that nothing should get back to the Air Force at the present stage.Whitehall Gardens, S/W.1., 6th June,  1932.
