                STATE OF TRADE - APRIL, 1952.        (Summary of reports made to the Board of Trade          Advisory Council in connection with their                  meeting on May 12th, 1922).     There was an increase in April in the number of personsunemployed.  The total increase was 65,000, due entirely toan increase, mainly in the coal mining and textile industries,in the numbers temporarily stoppedj  the number whollyunemployed showed a slight decline after allowing on the onehand for the effect of legislative changes and on the other for the addition to the register of children leaving school atEaster.   The increases occurred in the Horth, the Midlands andSouth Wales, there being little change in Scotland and a slightimprovement in London and the South.     On the other hand while imports, at  55,500,000, werethe lowest for the month for several years, domestic exports,at  ?4,800,000, were higher in April than in any month since january 1951.  If March and April are taken together to avoid the disturbance of Easter, there waa an increase in the classof wholly or mainly manufactured goods oompared with theprevious year of  950,602.     In order to avoid disturbance in the figures by the incidence of Easter, the figures of railway traffic for Marchand April are taken together.  They show, taking all receiptstogether, a total decline of 8.0% compared with 6,9% inFebruary and 8.4$ in January;  on merchandise alone the declineis 11.6$ compared with 6,6% in February and 9.1$ in January;the tonnage figures tell the same tale and the corresponding figures for the first week in May were still worse, beingdown by 9.8  (all receipts) and 14.2% for merchandise.  Theonly bright spot is a definite improvement in the figures ofcoal and coke traffic which, judged by receipts and by tonnage,show distinctly less falling off than either passenger trafficor other merchandiseB
     The railways report that while a large number of plans for the transfer of factories to this country from abroad haveoome to the notice of the railways and while some of thetransfers actually took place, whole plants being brought over from abroad, the restrictions which were at once put on theexport of used machinery by Germany and Switzerland preventedmany schemes from coming to fruition.   The Railway Companiesreport that there is an active demand for &quot;ready-made&quot; siteswith sidings already attached.     The March improvement in employment in the coal miningindustry was not maintained in April, there being on thecontrary a large increase in unemployment;  the numberstemporarily stopped increased by 58s000, and those whollyunemployed by 5,000.  exports  in April were higher than inApril last year, but this is no doubt due to the fact thatEaster fell in April last year.  Fhile, however, all export markets remain very depressed it is reported that there are indications of an increasing will to buy British coal in the scandinavian countries.     There was a slight decline in employment in the iron andsteel industry during April and in spite of the incidence ofEaster the output of both pig iron and steel ingots was below that for March.  Up to the present the industry has felt no benefit from&quot; the duties, but it is thought that this is due tothe stocks of pre-duty foreign material which are still beingworked off, and it is reported that there has lately been a rather more hopeful tone and a considerable increase inenquiries.   Imports of both pig iron and steel continue to beon a much reduced soale, but prices are very unsatisfactory;the pig iron  imports are disturbing the market more by theirlow price than by their quantity,, and, in steel, Continentalquotations are still being made which are below the Britishprices even inoluding the new duty.   Exports remain verydepressed and were below those for last April, notwithstanding that Faster fell in April last year.
     The shipbuilding position remains substantially unchanged.There were no overseas orders last month and at home contractswere placed for only 4 snail vessels.  The figures of tonnagelaid up in this country on April 1st were better by 100,000 tonsthan in April last year and by 166,000 tons than in January thisyear, but there is no confirmation of the newspaper rumours of alarge movement of shipping.   The index number of freights was practically unohanged during the month and there was on the wholea reduotion in chartering owing to a heavy falling off in businesshomeward from the Argentine, hitherto the brightest spot.     The Russian market remains the chief preoccupation of the machine tool industry and almost their only export market;  of thetotal exports of  816,000 of machine tools in the first quarter ofthis year  665,000 went to Russia.  The import duty here isconsidered to be sufficient substantially to reduce imports, butanxiety is expressed lest the German and American manufacturers,finding obstacles in this less important market, will concentratestill more upon Russia.     There was some seasonal improvement in employment in the motor oar industry but while the demand for the small oar is well maintained the home market for cars over 12 horse power is declining both for passenger and commercial vehicles, and there isanxiety in the trade generally as to the future.  The improvementin exports is maintained, especially to the Dominions, and it is satisfactory that the foreign demand for the British small car isimproving both in range and amount.   concern  was expressed at thenew Irish Free State duties on motor oar bodies.     Production in the cotton industry in April was fairly well maintained but there was a slight setbaok in employment.  Saleswere down, and there was a further fall in the price of raw cotton.  Exports of yarns were less in February and Maroh than inJanuary but remained above the average for the last quarter of1931.  Exports of piece goods in March and April and for the four months were higher than in 1931, and it is satisfactory that the increases in piece goods this year have not been confined to China                              -3-
as in the last ouarter of last year.  The increases includesubstantial gains in  India, China, Holland and Scandinavia, andthe British Dominions and Colonies.  A very striking improvementoccurred in exports to British Vrest Africa, which, in the first four months of the year have risen from 39,681,600 square yards in 19S0 and 24,805,700 in 1951, to 45,956,900 this year.     Employment in the woollen and worsted industry remainsgood compared with a year ago but a seasonal slowing down Into be expected, and in fact there was an increase in unemploymentin Bradford in the last week of April for the first time since september.  The exports of woollen and worsted yarnsihis yearhave shown substantial improvement compared with last year;the exports of piece goods are below last year&apos;8 figures butthe difference is not great and it can be ^aid that, for thepresent, the decline has been stopped.  Complaint was madegenerally of restrictions abroad and especially of the effects of the new Greek Currency Law.     The report from the silk industry, covering as it did theperiod of uncertainty prior to the Budget and then of low dutiesfollowing the repeal of the abnormal import duties, was not very satisfactory this month, but the industry anticipates relief from the new duties imposed and it is confidently expected thatthe report will be better next month.     As regards other industries, there was further slightseasonal improvement in the building industry;  this is one ofthe few industries in which employment is worse in Londonthan elsewhere.  The cement industry reports a reduction in home trade due to eoonomy amongst Local Authorities, and complains ofthe effect of restrictions abroad;  exports for the past quarterare down by 5$ compared with 19?1, whereas the trade of our ohiefcompetitors shows a large falling off.  The report of the chemical Industry continues to be satisfactory showingimprovement In both the home and export markets in almost all sections;  satisfaction was expressed at the scale of the new
duties.  The demand for soap has, it ia reported, remained3table throughout the depression;  margarine has suffered fromthe low price of butter and the demand for edible oils shows a,decline compared with last year, but considerable improvement inApril.     The governing factor of the world wheat situation at thepresent time is the announcement that the United States winterorop in estimated at 458 million bushels this year compared with787 million bushels last year.  The impression of the Co-operative wholesale Society here is that this may be an under-estimate withthe objeot of making. Europe buy.  T&amp;e Canadian wheat position is considerably better than last year, there being a balanae forexport and carry-over of only 176 million bushels at the end ofMarch this year instead of the 214 at the same date last year;the estimated carry-over at the end of July is leaa than for anyorop year since 1928.   It is reported that shipments of grainfrom South Russia have ceased and are not expected to begin againuntil the new crop is ready.  In both Oanada and Russia, however,there are prospects of a good orop next seanon and, if these arerealised, there should be a large surplus in the autumn in thesecountries.     Reference was made to the purchase by Russia of grain and flour from Canada and Australia for shipment to vladivostock,the reason alleged being that this was found cheaper thaw thetransport from South Russia, whether by Sea or overland by rail.     The  figures of retail trade in March show a-decline of6.1 per cent, as compared with last year, but these figures are affected  by Easter coming this year in March and last year inApril.  The decline in retail trade in March in Germany was19.2$ and in the United States 20$.    Co-operative trade has again increased in both volume and value, and the Society reportsthat compared with last year retail prices have fallen rather morethan wholesale prices.     The  chief features of interest in the money market during themonth vrere the Budget, and the announcement of an issue of
Treasury  Bonds.  The Budget Tas regarded as a sound financialdocument, criticisms being directed not so much to the absence of relief to the taxpayer but rather to the lack of any definitepromise of further economies.  The most discussed Section of theBudget vras that dealing with the Exchange Equalization Account -a proposal which met with general approval.  On the whole money was steadily comfortable and except for one or two isolateddays very little fresh clearing bank money was used.     The outlook both in Europe and America was described as being very gloomy and the general attitude as one of anxious waiting.     The attempts at credit inflation in America appear, so far,to have had no effect on commodity prices.     According to a Statement published in the Frankfurter Zeitunga new banking syndicate has been formed in Germany for financingRussian business.  The Syndicate comprises 15 banks and bankingfirms and has at it3 disposal a re-discount credit of 140 millionReichsmarks.     Published figures show that the loss on the German Railwaysfor the year 1931 was 442 million gold reichsmarks compared witha net profit in 1930 of 104 millions, and the traffics for thefirst quarter of 1972 show a decline of 31?? for goods and 17%for passengers.  For the same period the sales of the German UnitedSteel Works are down almost 40%.     The report from Australia is good and shows general expansion.There ha.s been a good demand for Australian wheat and wool, theUnited Kingdom being the chief buyer of the latter product thisseason.  There is a serious drought and danger of considerable^lossof  stock in Queensland,  There was little change in the conditionsin  Canada in  March and the position reported is satisfactory;there was considerable activity in the production of motor car sand of iron and steel and  a heavy import of both raw cotton andwool.     The Indian price level has remained satisfactorily steadysince December, and the March figures of Indian trade show that
imports and exports were well maintained.  Owing partly it isthought to confidence inspired by the Budget announcement of theExchange Equalisation Account Scheme, exports of gold have kept up to about normal at a rate of  4 to  5*000,000 a month.  Thereis the largest surplus of American cotton since the war withthe result that the prices of Indian and American cotton arenow so close that Indian mills are buying American cotton.The campaign to encourage restriction of jute sowings resultedin a fairly satisfactory reduction in the jute crop.  It isreported that the results of this year*s British IndustriesPair were very satisfactory to India.     The reports from  India and Ceylon express satisfactionwith the new tea preference.  The sugar preference is alsoexpected to a,ssist the Colonies, but the sugar market is ina very serious position at present and it is doubtful if anyproducers are selling at a profit.   Generally, it can be saidthat Colonial producers selling most of their products to theUnited Kingdom are more cheerful, while those of whose productsthere is a large Empire surplus remain very depressed.
