1.      Our colleagues will like to have an account ofcur visit to the Irish Free State.                                   on June 5th2.      V/e travelled through to Dublin/accompanied bySir Edward Harding and by Mr.  Buianty, the Irish FreeState High Commissioner.   we had a long private tali-:with Mr. Dulanty on the way to Holyhead5     what weendeavoured to get from him was some account ofMr. de Valera&apos;s mentality and the prospects which he saw for our conversation on the following day.3.      Mr. Dulanty was not very optimistic.   He saw no likelihood of Mr.  de Valera departing from his attitude that the Irish Free State could remove the oath by unilateral   act ion 5 and that the existence notonly of the Oath in its present form, but of any Oathwas incompatible with the security end progress of theIrish Free State.    So far as we could judge $ the most that he was hoping for was to bring Mr.  de Valera toLondon5 and thereby to remove him from the influence ofthat section of his party which was accustomed to tell him that &quot;the British were always bluffing&quot; and that ifhe stuck to his points they would finally give way.4.      From this point of view Mr.  Dulanty was constantlyurging us to put forward, in the talks at Dublin, what he called &quot;the minimum of our demands&quot;, with the idea that any statement as to the &quot;maximum of our demands&apos;,&apos; ifnecessary to be made, should be made in London later inthe week.5.      Mr. Dulanty was also anxious that we should notbe &quot;betrayed into irritation by anything Mr. de Valeramight say, and he seemed to : think that some of hissentiments might appear  shocking to our ears.&apos;     V/e                          1.
       re-assured Mr. Dulanty  on  the latter point.   We also       assured him. that we shared his view as to the importance       of  securing &quot;chat Mr. de Val era should come to London       hut we made  it clear that y/e could not adopt an attitude       which might lead him ofterwards to say that he had been       brought to London on false pretences.       6.      Since it seemed lively that Mr.  Dulanty would &quot;be       in  communication with Mr. de Valera before we saw him       ourselvess we took the opportunity to make clear to       Mr.  Dulanty again the attitude of the British Government -       namely3 that we were convinced that the Oath was mandatory       in  the Treaty Settlement^ that we could not countenance the       unilateral repudiation of agreements s and that if the       Irish Free State persisted in their present attitude3       the necessary consequence was that we could enter into no       new agreements with them at Ottawa.       7.      On arrival at Dunleary (Kingstown) on the morning of       June 7th, we were welcomed officially as guests of the       Irish Free State Government by Mr. Sean T. 0&apos;Kelly s Vice       President of the Executive Council&quot; and by Mr. JoP.Walshe3       Secretary of the Department of  External Affairs ? and were       driven by oar to the Shelbourne Hotels Dublin9 with       &quot;guards&quot; following in two other cars.    (These latter       accompanied us throughout the day).       8.      The Governor General had sent one of his A.D.CB.       to meet us at Dunleary s with an invitation to dine at       Vice &quot;Regal Lodge in the evening.   Since our programme for       the day v/as uncertain,  and since we were due to catch the       return boat at 8.50 p. m. s we had. no option but to requestNote.  Mr, 0&apos;Kelly was one of the Members.of the Irish Free  StateExecutive Council who had recently left  the  Reception at theFrench Legation on the-Governor General&apos;s arrival.   V/o were  toldby Mr. Dcianty that his action in coming to  meet us, and in  agree-ing to be photographed with us,  was a great  gesture  of friendlib-ness, and might well cost him his seat in The  Dail.
to be excused.   \, e asked the A. D.C. in thanking HisExcellency to let him know that we were anxious to pay ourrespects to him, and hoped to be able to call at ViceRegal Lodge in the course of the afternoon, though v/e couldnot say exactly at what tine v/e should be there.9.      V/e left the Hotel for Government Buildings just before 11.30 a.m. , and -were immediately received byMr.  de Valera.   we had nearly I5 hours private conversationwith him, and with Mr.  Geoghegan, E.G. , Minister of Justice.hlo one else v/as present.10.      Mr. de Valera began  by saying that there were twomethods-of trying to reach an agreement, either by dealingwith &quot;fundamentals&quot; or by aiming at a  &quot;modus Vivendi&quot;.In his opinion it v/as very important for both countries that they should live together on friendly terms.   Theirgeographical propinquity made it very difficult for eithercountry not to be affected by its relations with the other,and in fact our commercial intercourse was of greatimportance.   He had been very much concerned a&quot;c Mr. Thomas&apos;statement in the House of Commons with regard to Ottawa.Whatever the possibilities of Ottawa were, it would be most desirable that both countries should be in a position totake advantage of them.   Was there not some way of getting.over the difficulties?
11.  In his opinion the great majority of the Irish peopledesired to remain in association with the British Commonwealth.But in Ireland, unlike the other Dominions, there was not, andnever could be, any sentiment of personal loyalty to the Throne.-          Historically the King of England for 750 years had beenthe symbol of oppression in Ireland.   During all that time theIrish people had been struggling against the British invader.  IfEngland were at war Ireland would not mind who won, since eventhe complete conquest of England, e.g. by Germany, could atworst only mean the exchange of rule by one &quot;foreign&quot; power forthat of another.   If, however, we could agree about &quot;fundamentals&quot;the whole situation would be transformed.   A free Ireland v/ouldeagerly come to the support of England, for fear that ifEngland were subjugated it would be the turn of Ireland nextjust in the same way as England was compelled by self-interestto go to the assistance of Erance and Belgium in 1914,  Mr,,LloydGeorge had missed a great opportunity in 1921.   A national government had a much better chance and ought to have the courage to seize the opportunity to-day.IS.  At this stage Mr. de Valera came to y$&amp; and without havingindicated what the &quot;fundamentals&quot; or the &quot;modus Vivendi,&quot; wereto which he had referred.          We asked him if he would tell us what he meant by the&quot;fundamentals&quot;.   He said - &quot;Certainly.&quot;   They were two -first the reunion of the six counties as to which, he said,Mr. Lloyd George seemed to him in 1921 to have been anxiousonly to secure the partition of Ireland, and secondly the recognition of the position of Ireland as a Republic.   Hereiterated the objection  of Irishmen to any allegiance to theKing.   He pointed out that, in addition, this involvedconsiderable expense in maintaining a Governor General whocost some  27,000 a year, and was only a &quot;rubber stamp,&quot;  If the
374position of Ireland as a Republic were accepted, he thoughtthat the great bulk of the Irish people would be willing,in cases in which, concerted action &quot;by the whole BritishCommonwealth was agreed upon,  the action should be takenin the name of the King as the titular head of theass ociation.          (We gathered from this - though we did notinterrupt - that Ireland was to be q Republic for alldomestic and internal purposes, but that when the BritishCommonwealth was acting together by agreement between itscomponent parts, the King&apos; s name should be used as the headof the Association.   We both had some difficulty inrefraining from entering a protest, but thought it wiser to keep silence).13.  We next asked Mr. de Valera what he meant by the&quot;modus Vivendi;&quot;   He said that, at the last election, hehad asked for and obtained a mandate for the abolition ofthe oath, for the retention of the annuities and for investigation into the legality of other payments made bythe Free State to the United Kingdom.   These totalled  5^million a year, and since Mr. Baldwin had calculated thetaxable capacity of the Free State as compared with theUnited Kingdom as 1 to 66 - this was equivalent to a demand on the people of the United Kingdom for over  330 million a year.   His Government had satisfied itself that therewas no legal  justification for demanding payment of the annuities;  it was investigating the  other payments, and hadalready reached the conclusion that some  of  them were not justified.    (He mentioned specifically the  Royal  irish constabulary  pensions as being either excessive  or notpayable - it  was not  very clear which he  meant.)         Mr.  de Valera said that the  &quot;modus  vivendi&quot; meant
acceptance by the United Kingdom of the abolition of the oath, and of the withholding of the unjustified payments.14.  He went on to say that nothing short of an agreement as to fundamentals would produce permanent peace end good-will between the two countries:  if an agreement as tofundamentals were reached, some bitterness might remain with those who had been actively engaged in the troublesof the last ten years, bat it would gradually dae out and be replaced by real cordiality and goodwill.   The treaty had been nothing but a boon to England, but that boon hadbeen bought at the cost of 10 years of civil war in Ireland.         If, on the other hand, we only agreed on a&quot;modus vivendi,&quot; that agreement would only last until afresh mandate had been secured at another election.         We must see that the fact that he (Mi&apos;, de Valera)had secured a majority after 10 years showed how deepseated was the determination of the Irish people to beset free from the injustice of the Treaty.15.  V/e asked him whether, by the abolition of the oath,he meant the abolition of the particular form of words,or the abolition of any oath at all.   He said that hemeant the latter:  and he explained that, so long as an oathexisted, it
prevented some people from taking part in the political life cf their country.   This denied these people freedom,and left them with no means of expression except arecourse to force.   A recourse to force meant ultimatelyrevolution.16.   At this stage the conversation looked like coming to an end.   But we wanted to leave something in Mr.de Valera&apos;s mind which he could think over &quot;before he came to London, and also to take a line which would prevent him from complaining afterwards that he hadbeen &quot;brought to London on false pretences.17.   Accordingly - taking the way of analogy, privatedisputes &quot;between individuals (this point was designedto appeal to Mr. Gecghegau)  and Trade Union arbitrations -we asked Mun de Valera (making it clear that it was nota proposal or a suggestion from onr Cabinet) whether he                  ahad considered if/possible &quot;modus Vivendi&quot; could &quot;be found&quot;by referring to some impartial authority, in whose competenceboth parties had confidence, the question whether, underthe Treaty, the Free State had trie right to abolish the oath, and the question whether they w ere bound  by agreement to make the disputed payments.18.   Mr. de Valera said that there could be no question as to the abolition of the oath., and that they were quite satisfied that they were right as to the payments.   he went on to say that the Irish people did not believe thatany impartial authority could be found;  &quot;The dice&quot;he said, &quot;would always be loaded in favour of the strongerparty&quot;.    Their experience in the Ulster boundary  disputehad confirmed them in this view.19.   Mr. de Valera said that he was so sure  that thematter of the oath was entirely a domestic matter that                          - 7 -   .       y
cj I-Mhe had been very much astonished when the BritishGovernment raised any objection or question about  it.7,re said that this showed how completely and sincerelythe parties were at varience,,  since we had been  equallyastonished that the President  announced his intention  ofdealing with the Oath without  having first communicated7/1 th us.
 20.     The  above is  the  substance of a long conversa- tion which,  we are bound  to say, left us with the impression that  the possibilities of coming to an agree- ment were very small  indeed.   Mr. de Valera appeared to us to be  a complete dreamer, and with no grasp of realities, though of  complete personal sincerity. 21.     We did, however, achieve the main object of our journey  in that we were able  to conduct the conversation  in a manner which raised no difficulty overMr. de Valera&apos;s own journey to London.    We ended the official interview on most friendly terms. 22.     The following official Communique was issued in dublin after our meeting:-        &quot;Mr.  Thomas and Lord Hailsham had an hour&apos;s    conversation with the President and Minister for    Justice this morning.    There was a preliminary    exchange of views, v/hich vail be followed by a    discussion in London on Friday morning as already    arranged&quot;. 25.     We were entertained at luncheon at the ShelbourneHotel by Mr.  de Valera and had a further friendly, though informal, talk with him.   Mr. S.T.  0&apos;Kelly andMr. Qeoghegan were the other Irish Free State ministers present.    After luncheon we drove to the Vice RegalLodge and signed our names in the Governor General&apos;s book.24.     Subsequently  we were talc en for a drive in theWicklow Mountains by Mr. S.T.0&apos;Kelly, Mr.  de Valera having excused himself on account of pressure of other work.Mr. 0&apos;Kelly, who subsequently dined with us at theShelbourne Hotel, was also most fraik and friendly throughout.        Nothing of significance arose out of the
conversations during the latter part of the day.25.     After dinner we returned &quot;by car to Dunleary, and left for London by the night mail.    Mr.  V/alshe saw us off at Dunleary.   Immediately after leaving Dunleary Wesent the following message by wireless to Mr.  de  Val era.  &quot;President Executive Council;)       Government Buildings ,              Dublin.         Please accept our warm thanks for your generous   hospitality.    ye look forward to your visit to London   Friday.                         THOMAS.                         KAILSEAM.  &quot;25.     We ought to add that Mr. Dulanty who was  with us throughout our visit * (except at the talk withMr. de Valera) was most considerate and helpful in everyway.   V/e are convinced that any advance towardsfriendliness$ which Mr. de Valera has mades is largely due to his skill and address.   We think that the IrishFree State may count themselves fortunate in having sotactful a representative in London at this juncture.                         (intl&apos;d&apos;d)    J.H.T.                            &quot;       H.June 8th, 1932.
