s document  is  the  property  of  His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.CABINET.. 158(32)                  SUNDAY ENTERTAINMENTS BILL .Memorandum by the Home Secretary.The only question outstanding with regard to theGovernment Bill which the Cabinet decided should be introduced to deal with the question of Sunday entertainment is theprocedure to be adopted by local authorities which have not hitherto permitted Sunday opening of cinemas, but which may wish to do so in future.facilities for extending Sunday opening.   On the other hand it is clearly undesirable that any authority should be prevented from putting its case before Parliament solely by considerations- of trouble and of expense.   The Private Billprocedure, with its committee stage and its appearance ofobjectors, is really inappropriate to a case where all that hasto be decided is whether another local authority shall beadded to the list of local authorities which already possesscertain clearly defined powers, and where therefore neitheramendment nor modification is possible.   Even if theGovernment Bill contained no special procedure, it would stillbe open to a local authority, which wished to obtain powers topermit the opening of cinemas on Sundays, to apply to parliament for these powers by means of a Private Bill, but I feel thatthe Government Bill should provide some alternative procedure.The existing Provisional Order procedure was designed to meetquite different circumstances and it is not suitable in thepresent case.   It does not eliminate the possibility of acommittee stage, it provides little effective opportunity forascertaining local opinion on such a, subject as this, and it                                                    places/On the one hand it is not desired to give too easy
places on the Secretary of State the duty of deciding whether any particular order shall be submitted to Parliament or not.          I therefore suggest that such provisions of thePrivate Bill procedure as are antecedent to the applicationto Parliament should be retained.   Boroughs and UrbanCouncils desiring  that an order shall be made, will have totake the usual steps of a town meeting, followed if necessary by a poll of the ratepayers, while in rural districts, ifobjection is raised, the application must be preceded by a^ienquiry ordered by the Secretary of State.   If the poll ofthe ratepayers or  the finding of the enquiry is in favour ofthe proposed order, then it is submitted to the Secretary ofState, who lays it before Parliament.   The order does not become operative until it has been affirelatively approved by.resolutions of both Houses.          This procedure appears to me to provide parliament with the means of  knowing the extent of local demand andthe opportunity therefore of making a proper decision.   Itis less expensive  than the ordinary Private Bill procedure,although the cost  will still be sufficient to deter frivolousapplications.   Finally by interposing both the test of publicopinion and the decision of Parliament between the making ofan application hy  an authority arid the legalising of Suiida3rcinemas in that area, it will diminish the danger of local elections being swayed by this controversy.          I have discussed the procedure with the attorney general and believe that it will meet with a&apos; large measureof acceptance.          I understand that it is desired to take the SecondReading of this Bill on the Friday after the Whitsun Recess,and I should be glad to have the authority of the Cabinet to                                              introduce/
H.S .OiS OFFICE:   10th May,  1932.introduce the Bill, including a provision on these lines,subject to any minor and drafting amendments which further&apos;examination of its provisions may .ahow to be necessary.
