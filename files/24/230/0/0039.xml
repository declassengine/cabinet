This document is the property of His Britannic, Majesty&apos;s      &quot;Government.MEMORANDUM BY&quot; THE SECHETAEY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS     I prepared this paper last week, in consultation withthe Treasury, and communicated it to the Prime Ministerand the Chancellor of the Exchequer.     I now circulate it to the Cabinet, since it may heof use when the Cabinet discusses the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment at the Lausanne Conference,  But it must be under-stood that this paper has not yet received the approval ofthe Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.SecretREPARATIONS.J a S .June 6th,1932.
Note on Reparations Policy by the Foreign Secretary,,   1*  Lausanne  is only 9. fortnight  off   Reports from paris  show that  there  is much anxiety  among those who mayconstitute the new French Government to know as  soon aspossible what will be  the lines  of British policy there*We urgently need to communicate  our  view to the  Frenchbefore a. declaration of policy by the  new French Governmentis made, and this will take place at the beginning cf next week,  if not before.-.   The resignation  of Dr0 Brfiningincreases the obscurity of Germany&apos;s domestic politics,but it remains clearer than ever that  the German attitudeat Lausanne will be not only to  deny the possibilitycf Germany resuming the reparations  payments at  presentbut, in effect^to reject any suggestion that she should agree to make even a modified payment  in certain con-tingenoies at some time in the futureo  This both simplifiesthe conditions of the practical problem and necessitatessome revision of our attitudes   Sir  Horace Knhbold, who ison leave from Berlin, has given me a. full description ofthe German atmosphere on the subject and in his  view thereis no question that Germany does not mean to make newpromises for payments hereafter-.  Dr,  Brdning would havetaken this line  at Lausanne in any case;  his successor will certainly not be less outspoken and  the only point of doubta.s to the German attitude is whether Germany at  Lausanne wiUpoint to the fact that she cannot pay  tactfully  or defiantly,In other words, Germany may go to Lausanne seeking an agree-mont for her release,  or,  on the other hand,  the new GermanGovernment may go there bluntly announcing that her oblige-tions will not  be fulfilled,,                                                 2c/
ki Ll o                                                       o   2o  It seems to me essential that the Cabinet should decide its policy lor Lausanne without any further dclsy0The problem is really simplified if we start with twopropositions:   (1) ?Ji^e.jigni^                                  by   (2) In this event, payment of debts to America will cease^,     The question therefore comes down to this - what isthe best method to be followed at Lausanne with a view to -presenting the British case to America and the world here-after in the most persuasive and favourable form?  the answer to this question involves3 amongst other things, a choice of the best treatment of two familiar conundrums3 theconundrum of associating reparations with debts and theconundrum of the &quot;common&quot; front  And in dealins; with bothconundrums, a most important aspect to bear in mind is thatcf our relations with Trance and the possibility of takings, line which may secure some measure of French co-operation in other fields, e0g.o disarmaments   3o  The difficulty of the whole problem is such itis better to make a concrete suggestion, and what followsis the result of a conference which I called, in the inevitable absence of the Prime Minister and. the Chancellorof the Exchequer, of my own and Treasury officials:   (a) We suggest that at Lausanre a. Resolution shouldbe passed by the Powers there assembled to the effect thatit is in the interests of the world that there shouldbe en all-round cancellation of reparations and war debts;                                               (b)/
     (h)   This should lead up to the negotiation of a[treaty, which would no doubt recite the above Resolutionbut which, in its operative parts would acknowledge thatthe obligations of Germany to pay reparations should betreated as discharged by payments already made and thatthe war debts owed by European Powers to one anothershould similarly be regarded as discharged;     (c)   This Treaty should be signed (buts for reason explained below,, not ratified) before the Lausanne Con-reference terminates.   If default is not to occur the treaty should be signed by the 1st of July.     (d)   It will be noted of course that the Resolutionreferred to under (a) covers war debts to America, whereas the Treaty refers only to war debts payable in Europe0This distinction is deliberate as will now appear;     (e)   The American Presidential election takes placeon November 5th and tho next instalment of war debts dueto America is payable on December 15th.   Between thesedates therefore a decision of some sort will have to bereached.   The best course would seem to be for no action  ;to be taken and no representations to be made to Americatill the Presidential election is overs   Then AmericansEuropean debtors would approach her, pointing out that Eurohas followed the course of setting her own house in order and representing that the Resolution in (a) still holdsgood and inviting America to co-operate by accepting it;     (f)   What a new American Government would say to this it is  impossible to say, but there are those who believe                                                  that
that if President Hoover was elected for a second term he might take the bold, line of responding as we wish.    a democratic victory would postoone such a possibility tillMarch at earliest.   Supposing that America refuses to releaher European debtors,, she may none the less offer a scalingdown by reference to capacity to pays   The British attitude as it seems to me, must in that case be an inversion of theprinciple of the Balfour Note.   We shall have to decline topty even a reduced sum - see paragraph 2 above - since weshall be getting nothing at all from Germany or from our european debtorsc   This will undoubtedly be the attitude olFrance.   But the procedure above outlined would at any ratsgive America the opportunity of joining in an all-roundcancellation;  if the opportunity is not accepted, then theBritish taxpayer will certainly demand that we make no morepayment So     (g)   If America releases her European debtors, thetreaty in (b) would then be ratified;   if not, the partiesmight still ratify or might leave the fact that reparationsand inter-Europe an debts have ceased to be paid to speak&quot; for itself.   But in any case there would have been a tacitagreement of the Powers at Lausanne not to ratify until theAmerican situation was known.     4,   There remains  the question  of the &quot;common front&quot;As long as there was a prospect of getting tolerable terms c.release from America by keeping our own case separate fromthat of her other European debtors, I  should have been infavour of following  the advice which many Americans have g:,vus of avoiding making common cause with Europe.   But this ilno longer the real  situation.   Either -America will be suffiently moved,  through appeals to  sentiment or through .?                                                imaginative
imaginative view oi what is best for the world, to remitthe war debts owing to her, or she will make demands onBritain which Britain will not be disposed to meet and whichwould impose an intolerable burden on us r a burden moreoverwhich the judgment of history will not regard as merited.Therefore, there is nothing to be gained by abstaining from taking up the common front and there is a good deal ofadvantage in taking it up promptly.  This is the only line which is likely to secure French co-co-operation.  If the abovescheme was approved, it would be possible to let Frenchstatesmen know, in anticipation of Lausanne, that we shouldbe prepared to stand with them on this line if they insist on it.  The negotiations would probably take the form of tellingMi Herriot in the first instance that we had corao to the deliberate conclusion that all-round cancellation of repara-tions and war debts was the course to be pursued.  Judgingby declarations made by him and M, Painlevp, it may well bethat they will agree.  But they would be almost certain to reply by attaching the conditions that the payment of war debts to America should cease at the same time, and that weshould make common cause with France in taking up thatattitude.  On the lines above sketched out wo should beable to givo them satisfactory assurances on this point,though I hope we should be able also in return for such support to gain some degree of French acquiescence indisarmament policy.  If this led to agreement at Geneva,itwould in turn affect American opinion favourably.

It will in present circumstances he difficult enough anyhow to secure that the Germanspokesman at Lausanne does not blurt out Germany!s resolveto repudiate in a provocative forme  A great deal would depend on the case being presented in more moderate terons,,And I should have thought that if but only if, the british cabinet has a scheme for Lausanne already settled, and agreed with the French5 it ought to be possible to make representa-tions to Germany as to the best way in which the German, casecould be stated,                                   51 st May 1.952.
