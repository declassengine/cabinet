COPY NO.CP.  199  (32).THE CABINET.IMPORT  DUTIES  ACT:  EFFECT  ON  IMPERIAL  PREFERENCE  IN GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.    MEMORANDUM  BY  THE SECRETARY  OF  STATE  FOR  WAR.    With the concurrence  of the  Admiralty, the Air  Ministry  and the Treasury, I Contractscirculate a memorandum by the Contracts Co-ordinating Committee on the effect of the   4362Import Duties Act on Impei&apos;ial Preference  in  Government Contracts.   The practice,which began in 1923 and has continued since  then, received Cabinet approval, and Ithink that the recommendation which the Committee now makes should also be referredto the Cabinet for decision, before it is adopted.                                                                            H.   THE  WAK  OFFICE,          dth June, 1932. MEMORANDUM  BY THE CONTRACTS  CO-ORDINATING- COMMITTEE.     The passing of the Import Duties Act, placing a  10 per cent, duty on imports(with certain exceptions) from foreign countries, raises the question of the policy to befollowed in future in respect of departmental Imperial Preference on contracts.     The present percentages defining the extent of the maximum preference  normallyto be given  in contracts to  products  of this country and the Empire  over those offoreign countries  (25 per cent, to home over foreign and 16f per cent, to Empire overforeign  products) were  adopted  generally in  1923 as the result of a recommendation by the Contracts Co-ordinating Committee.     To give full departmental preference up to the limits of 25 per  cent, and 16f percent, in  respect of articles now taxed  under the  Import  Duties Act  would, of course,give to Home and Empire producers a larger advantage over the foreign producer  than was  contemplated  when  those  limits were  laid down and  would involve a corre-correspondingly higher cost to Departments.     The Contracts  Co-ordinating Committee discussed the question at its 64th meetingheld on  12th April  and recommended that from a purchasing point of view the present     )authorised preference percentages of 25 per cent, and 16f per cent, should be regardedas inclusive maxima, and should be subject to an appropriate deduction in cases wherethe article to be purchased is subject to an import duty.     The Committee  set forth  the following reasons   in  support of  their  recom-mendation :      (1)  When the original grant; of preference was decided upon, the effect was that the          -  Government as  purchaser did  voluntarily  what the  general  body  of            purchasers in the country  could be made to  do  only  by the imposition of            import  duties.  Now that a-preference in respect of some articles has been            made compulsory on all  purchasers, it is considered that the voluntary            preference in respect of those  articles given by  purchasing Departments            should  logically  continue only  to  the extent  to which it exceeds the            compulsory  preference of the import duty.(B32/8) 60 6/32 W.O.P. 6207
(2) It has been the practice in the case  of articles protected  by the safeguarding       duties not to allow the full limit of preference but to take into consideration       any duty on the foreign article ; and from the departmental standpoint there       appears to be no reason tor adopting a different principle in the case of the       new import duties.(3) To allow to British and Empire producers a higher preference than the rates       already laid down might involve a  serious tax  on  departmental votes.       Certain duties have since been increased beyond 10 per  cent. ;  and the more       the duty is increased the greater is the advantage given to the Home and       Empire producer at a correspondingly higher cost to the State.(4) This consideration applies with  special force in  the case  of manufactured       articles of  which the raw material  must  in any case be imported.  In       applying the usual departmental preference to such  articles, it is  the       practice to allow the percentage of preference not on the whole cost of the       article, but only on those elements of the  cost which represent materials       and work capable of being produced or carried out in this  country.   But in       such cases the new import duty is levied on the whole cost of the article ;       thus, e.g., copper rods are  taxed  on their  whole value and not merely on       the cost of  the labour necessary to - produce the rod from the ingot.   The       result is that in these cases the British producer already obtains  under the       Import Duties Act preference much  in excess  of  the nominal percentage       of import  duty, and  it appears  unnecessary to  allow  in  addition  the       authorized percentages of departmental preference.(5) The  extent of Empire  Preference is  to be considered  by  the  Imperial       Conference at Ottawa, and pending their decision it might be impolitic at       the present moment  to  allow  additional preferences  to  Empire  products       with the  possibility that  they might have to be withdrawn subsequently.
