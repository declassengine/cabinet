THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT60Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1932.MOST SECRET.Copy No.  Q  CP.  164 (32).CABINET.DISARMAMENT.       MEMORANDUM BY THE  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EOREIGN AFFAIRS.     THE three papers annexed are circulated in connection with the decisionof the Cabinet of the 11th May (Cabinet 27 (32), Conclusion 5 (b)), which called for a  memorandum  setting out, from the point  of view  of disarmament as awhole, the proposal for  the  abolition of naval  and military  aviation and  therestriction of civil aviation. The first of the documents which follow is the draftof such a memorandum;  in order to give Members of the Cabinet more time to study  it, and in view of the urgency of reaching  a decision,  the Lord Presidentof the Council has  directed that it  should be  circulated in  its present formwithout waiting  in  the  first instance for  the full commentary of  the service departments.  It will, of course, be of great importance to  learn  what these departments think of the  plan in its technical  aspects, but the  main question raised by the memorandum is a question of broad political  policy.   Either  theBritish Government has to be content with  much smaller proposals in the field of air disarmament, which, whatever  their merits, are not likely to give general satisfaction, or we must  put forward some more  fundamental  plan which offersprospects of  disarmament on a much more striking scale.  If the latter course is decided upon the annexed memorandum indicates the lines along which  theproposals must be advocated.     2.  The  second  and  third documents should be read in connection with  thefirst;  the second is  a  Foreign Office  memorandum reviewing  the present stateand  prospects of  the Disarmament Conference.  If things go on  as they are, itis impossible to take a cheerful view of this.  The paper suggests  the possibilityof a more modest but,  it is thought, a more hopeful programme in land and  seadisarmament,  which would  be  best  brought  about  in combination with  theadoption of the first memorandum.     3.  The third document is a draft Convention for the abolition of military aircraft, as proposed in the first memorandum, together with the internationaliza-tion of civil aviation;  for  the memorandum shows that, if military  aviation isto be abolished, some form  of control  of civil aviation must at the same time be instituted. It is not suggested that this third document should be published withthe memorandum, but  it has been drawn  up in order that the conception maybe examined in concrete form.    4.  If proposals on the above lines were to be  approved,  it would seem desirable that they should be privately discussed at the earliest possible date withthose who will shortly  be in control of French foreign policy.   It  would be well,for instance, to get  M. Herriofs ear for any new British proposals before hebecomes too wedded to proposals of his own or proposals submitted to him from french sources.   The matter is the more urgent in that the French are reportedto be on the point of asking whether we have any plans to propose in regard to-disarmament and reparations.    5.  The new French Government may be formed  about the 5th  June. The-General Commission of the Disarmament Conference may be expected to resume[7051]n
sat  Geneva about the 10th June.  The Reparations Conference meets at Lausanneon the 16th June, so that there is very little time to spare.    6.  The proposals put forward in these papers should be regarded as integralparts of a whole plan  designed with the knowledge that something must be given,both to France  and  Germany, if results are to be  achieved  at Geneva andachieved quickly.  To eliminate one or other of  these proposals would tend to destroy the chances of the plan as a whole proving  acceptable at Geneva.   If itis rejected we seem to be condemned to a policy of drift in the matter of disarma-ment, which, at  the best, can bring credit neither to His Majesty&apos;s Governmentnor to the.Conference assembled at Geneva, and,  at the worst, may lead to veryserious consequences indeed.

                               ENCLOSURE f.           DRAFT PROPOSALS  FOR AIR  DISARMAMENT.    1.  HIS Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have for some time&quot;been preoccupied with the question of what is the best solution of the difficult problems presented to the Disarmament Conference by the question of disarma-ment  in the air.  On the 22nd February they formulated the proposal that theDisarmament  Conference  should undertake &quot; the  practical examination of thewhole problem of bombing from the air in its widest possible form.&quot;  Since thenthey have reserved any expression of their views on the major issues involved,as they desire to listen with an open mind to the arguments in support of thevarious proposals made to the Disarmament Conference.   They have, however,supported the principle that the Disarmament  Conference should pay  special attention to those weapons which are most threatening to civilians, which wasincorporated in the following resolution adopted by the General Commission onthe 22nd April last         &quot;        &quot; In  seeking  to  apply the  principle  of qualitative  disarmament,  as    defined in the previous  resolution (document  Conf.  D/C. G.  26 (11)), the    Conference  is of opinion that  the range  of land, sea, and air armaments    should be examined by  the competent special commissions with a view to    selecting those weapons whose  character is the most specifically offensive    or those most  efficacious against national  defence or most threatening to-    civilians.&quot;    2.  His Majesty&apos;s Government  have now given further consideration to thesubject, in the light of the above resolution and of the discussions that have takenplace at Geneva  on the various aspects of disarmament.   In their opinion thetime has come when the Conference must consider what should be the scope ofthis, the first effort to bring about some practical measure of world disarmament.It may be that the programme hitherto envisaged has been too ambitious to berealised in full  at the  first attempt.  Nevertheless,  His Majesty&apos;s government believe  that  substantial progress can  be made  if, but  only if, the  nationsrepresented at the Conference are prepared, in  certain aspects of disarmament,to consider measures of the widest  scope.  This applies more particularly to disarmament in the air.    3.  The general conclusion  to which His Majesty&apos;s Government has  come isthat,  so far as disarmament in  the air is conceited, nothing short of measuresof the widest scope will suffice. They therefore propose to the  DisarmamentConference the abolition  of all military  and naval aircraft,  combined  with astrict international  control of civil aviation.   This control  is essential,  since,without it, civil aircraft could be converted for  use as military machines on..the usa^Ja^   ,outbreak of war and, in the absence of military  and  naval aircraft^ reduction of cOr**^a&amp;the subsidies now paid for civil aviation, as well as the  regulation of all civil CU&amp;^&amp;CirK  .aircraft on a co-ordinated plan concerted between the Governments represented&apos; [^( ^^oX^oJ,at the Disarmament Conference, with  the object of  preventing  civil  aviation ^jz.a\, it from  becoming an instrument of aggression.                                  L-,^ (&apos;unrU^    His Majesty&apos;s Government further  suggest  that  these  measures  ^^J^JJ^ Ji.disarmament  should be accompanied by the  conclusion of  an  international convention to prohibit bombing from the air as a method of warfare a measure which, for  the reasons  given below in paragraphs 11 to 14, is not likely to  proveeffective except as part of a comprehensive plan  of air  disarmament.    4.  By the above means, as will now be shown, it should be possible not onlyto make a decisive  contribution to  the cause of peace,  but to bring about animportant measure of  disarmament affecting the air forces in the first instanceand extending consequentially to other arms.   At the same  time the resulting-economies should do something to ease the financial situation of  all the Statesrepresented at the  Disarmament Conference.       [7051]                                                     B 2
     5.  At. the Disarmament Conference  frequent reference has  been  made to the widespread sense&apos;of fear and insecurity which it is one of the main objects of the Conference to allay.  His Majesty&apos;s Government believe that the menace of air.forces is one of the main causes of that phenomenon.  Until their advent the civilian part of a nation as a whole was exempt, not, indeed, from the general pressure of a state of war, but at any rate  from its more hideous manifestations. To-day, however, this is no longer the case.  Every schoolboy and schoolgirl knows that, in the event of war, aircraft can and will be employed to bomb objectives far beyond the zones of armies and navies.  Even though their activities may, in theory,  be  confined  to objectives of military concern, such as military forces; military works; military  establishments  or   depots;  factories  constituting important  and well-known centres engaged  in the  manufacture of arms, ammunition or distinctively military supplies; lines of communication or trans- portation used for  military purposes,* the civilian populations living  in  their vicinity cannot hope to escape casualties, terror and suffering in the event of a bombardment.  At  the present time, when national and  industrial mobilisation forms part  of the system of defensive preparations of many nations, the legitimate objectives to attack are so numerous and so widespread that few cities or towns within the  danger zone will be exempt from the general menace.     6.  The truth of  these  observations is illustrated by the open preparations that are being made to-day in many countries to educate the population as to how they can best seek protection in  the event of aircraft attack.  The preparations vary in different countries, but if Press reports are to be believed, great  national and municipal organisations  are being built up to  deal  with this terrifying problem; personnel is being enrolled; national societies have been formed &quot;for the same  purpose;  lectures  are being  given,  often under  Government auspices; shelters are being marked out for  use in  case of air attack; the evacuation of towns and  even of cities in danger zones is being considered; the design of new towns and  buildings in such manner as to render them less susceptible to air attack is sometimes  advocated;  and practical tests of these arrangements  have taken  place in several  countries.  It is especially sinister that,  notwithstanding the existence of the Geneva Gas  Protocol of the 17th June, 1925, which has been ratified by twenty-eight countries, the measures to protect the civilian populations against air attack are  reported to include  precautions against the use of poisongases.   There is much evidence of the extent to which this subject is preoccupying the minds of the peoples of the world.  Gas-masks are said  to be on sale in  some countries and  facilities are  provided for instruction in their use.   In 1929 the International Committee of the Red Cross offered a prize of  400 for  the best detector of mustard gas.  The prize was  not won.  A special  meeting on the subject was held at  Brussels in 1930 and an elaborate Report was produced.     7.   It is hardly possible to conceive a  more potent cause of unrest than this intensive but,  in existing circumstances,  almost unavoidable  propaganda  to educate the public to the dangers of future  war, since it penetrates into everyhome.   It may serve to some extent as a deterrent to war by educating the people to its horrors, but this  is offset by the morbid and suspicious frame of mind thatit engenders, and, by the stimulus which it  gives to a demand for ever-increasingarmaments to meet the menace.   And, judging by our experience, the more closely the problem is studied, the stronger is the impression of the physical, moral andmaterial damage to  the civilian  populations that would be  inflicted by aircraft,notwithstanding all  possible precautions,  especially  in the event of a  suddenaggression as a first act of war.     8.  Yet aerial warfare is still in its infancy.  Its potentialities are incal-culable.  If it is left to develop unchecked, the limits of its frightfulness,  even within a few years,  cannot be measured.  The present concentration of effort on.so terrible a weapon is a blot on civilisation, which His  Majesty&apos;s Governmentinvite the Disarmament Conference to delete.    * Note: These are the  legitimate military objectives laid down in Part II, Article 24, of theGeneral Report of the Commission of Jurists to consider and report upon the Revision of the Rules of warfare, dated from The Hague, February 1923.
     9.  The appalling prospects indicated in the preceding section are plain toall those who are engaged in the work of defensive and precautionary preparation for war under modern conditions, and His Majesty&apos;s Government feel no doubtthat all the States taking part in the Disarmament Conference share their viewthat some means ought to be found to eliminate  this menace.   Before  putting forward their present proposals they have, of course, studied very carefully everyalternative.   They have suggested  the abolition of military and naval air forces and  the international control of civil aviation, for the reason that they  find, oh-examination, that no other plan will effect the purpose in view.     10.  A reduction in the size of the aeroplane is one such method  which they themselves intend to suggest, if their  larger proposals  do not prove  acceptable.Admittedly, however, this is a measure of limitation rather than of reduction ofarmaments.  It  is not a radical solution,  but only  a partial mitigation of one ofthe worst evils of aerial warfare.  As science advances it is liable to be renderednugatory by  the development of smaller machines of greater  power or carryingmore deadly  explosives.  Its effect, once war had begun, would not last  long, aslarger machines would probably be produced.     11.  Another proposal that is  attractive at first sight is the prohibition ofthe  bombardment from the  air of the civil population.  But, for the reasons give above in paragraph 5, it would be extremely difficult to render it  effective in  the conditions  of modern  warfare.   Nevertheless,  failing more  effective measures, His Majesty&apos;s Government advocate the further exploration of thesubject and would support any practical proposal on these lines.     12.  A third proposal, to which most careful consideration  has  been given,is the prohibition either of bombing aeroplanes or of the act of bombing, or ofboth.  At first sight this is a most attractive proposition, and  it is only  withthe  greatest  reluctance  that His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  feel  constrained to question its efficacy  as a basis for disarmament, except in conjunction with the wider proposals  outlined in  paragraph  3 above.  The value of this proposedrule depends  upon whether reliance can  be placed on its observance in time ofwar.  If doubts are  expressed on this point they must not be taken as a reflectionon the good faith of any nation.  If the nations of the world were to adopt anysuch rule they would, of course, do so with every intention to observe it loyally.Experience,  however,  has  shown  how  often such  rules  are  broken whensubjected to  the  stern  test  of  war.  When  a country&apos;s safety is at stake;when  a great part of  its  citizens are enrolled in  the  fighting  forces  and living  under  conditions  of constant  danger;   when  propaganda,   rumourand  suspicion are  abroad,   perspective  is  distorted  and  human  psychologyseems  to undergo some  subtle  change.  In  normal  times, perhaps,  the aboveconsideration is apt to be overlooked, but it is a practical point that ought tobe kept in mind.  To-day  every aircraft is  a potential bomber, and it seems doubtful whether a  rule to bar bombing could be  relied on with any confidence.If bombing was thought likely, at the crisis of  a nation&apos;s  fate, to make thedifference between  victory  and defeat,  between a short war and  a long  one,judging from past experience the temptation might be overwhelming  to use  somepretext to resort to it, for example, in retaliation for some real  or supposed breach of the laws of war by the enemy.     13.  If reliance on  a Convention which was limited to  declaring bombingillegal could  not be justified in the stress of conflict, it would, standing by itself,,provide in time  of  peace a  false  sense  of security and prove  a snare and adelusion.  After bombing had  been prohibited the  role of  aircraft would belimited to  co-operation with fleets and armies; the  numbers of machines thatwould be justified would be conditioned by the  size of a nation&apos;s navy and army.In the case of navies the numbers of aircraft are comparatively small, and their use is specialised.  Eor most States, therefore, the size of the army would providethe criterion.. Countries with great conscript armies  would require large airforces; those  with small  armies could justify relatively only a few machines.If war were  to break out and during its  course the rules against bombing wereinfringed whether  as an act of retaliation or otherwise-the position ,of thenations that had entrusted their security to a rule  of war might well be perilous.
It is. doubtful, therefore, whether nations  would. consent to disarm on  such abasis and this impression is confirmed by the.preparations  mentioned in para-graph 6 above, that are being made in many countries to provide against the-prohibited weapon  of, poison gas, -preparations that  extend to  the  civilian population as Well as to the armed forces.                          &apos;     14.  The above objections, however, would apply with less force if. militaryand  naval aircraft were abolished and civil, aviation controlled,, and, in thesecircumstances, His Majesty&apos;s  Government advocate  the abolition of bombing asa complement to their main proposals for the suppression of  air armaments.     15.  It has been shown  above  that  there are  two  alternative methods bywhich security for  the civilian  population can  be obtained against bombing attacks.   One is by  a rule of war, which,  for the reasons given, would not be suffiently. reliable to  provide a basis for  disarmament.  The other is  by theabolition  of  the  weapons by  which  the attacks can be made, which would constitute a practical and important measure of disarmament.     16.  Even the abolition of military  and naval  aviation, however,  taken by itself, would not be  sufficient, since  in  that event civil aircraft would dominatethe  air.   An overwhelming  advantage  would rest with those nations whoseconditions are favourable to the maintenance of a large civil aviation.  That is why His Majesty&apos;s Government have included, as an essential element in their proposal, that strict control should also be exercised  over civil aviation.                                    IV.     17.  The above examination of  suggested  alternatives has  satisfied  HisMajesty&apos;s  Government, and  will,  they believe,  satisfy  every  unprejudicedinvestigator,  that  the prospective evils sketched  in Section II can be  avoidedonly by international action, and  that  this  can best take the form  indicated inthe present  Memorandum.  His Majesty&apos;s  Government  now wish to point outthat this  solution  of the problems of air disarmament, besides being the onlveffective one, brings in  its train large consequential advantages.     IS.  For  example,  the Aircraft-Carrier, one of  the most expensive types of warship, could be dispensed with altogether.     19.  In addition, the abolition  of  military and naval aircraft, by securing-that there shall be no attack  from the air,  brings as a direct consequence some-relief  in  connection with naval  armaments,  including  Capital Ships.   any reduction in the size of  Capital Ships should bring in its train other reductions;for example, in coast defences, in the size of docks, and in anti-aircraft defenceson shore as well as afloat.  If, indeed,  a  reduction in the size of Capital Ships -helped to  secure the reduction or  abolition  of Submarines, a far wider relief isopened up to a stricken  world.  In the latter eventuality the use of contact mines in the open sea would also be abandoned.  Thus the prospect is opened up of awhole  chain  of inter-connected reductions  of armaments.   Even  if  the wholeof these results could not be achieved, substantial advantages would be realised,.including a considerable reduction in expenditure.                                     V.     20.  His  Majesty&apos;s Government are well aware  that a far-reaching proposal of this kind  must entail consequences  which, from certain points of view,  willbe disadvantageous,  and must present difficulties which can only be surmountedby the goodwill and cordial co-operation of all the nations concerned.     21.  Every nation  will view with unfeigned regret the passing of those airforces whose daring and chivalry  recall the achievements of their ancestors  in apast age in other fields  of adventure and exploration.     22.  The main difficulties, however, are likely to be found in the subjection1of civil aviation to international  control; and this  is an aspect  of the questionof air disarmament to which the Conference will have to devote the most careful study.. At the present stage His Majesty&apos;s  Government only propose to offer an outline of their proposals as  a basis for consideration : but at the appropriate-stage they are prepared to develop their ideas in greater detail.
 &apos;.    23.  ! The: object to be achieved is to bring about, through international co- operation, the development&apos; of civil aviation^ but at the * same- time-to- prevent all possibility of&apos; its constituting a warlike menacein the future:  &apos;       - ii  l^nit     24.   The civil aircraft to be dealt with are of two kinds!   There are, first of all, the great international and national air lines, employing aircraft of the largest size and power,&apos; which could rapidly be  converted into formidable engines of war.   There are- in addition, larger numbers of-smaller machines&apos; used for such purposes as training, experiment; sport,  locomotion, and for hire.    Both classes will require to be placed under some form of international control.   1     25.   His Majesty&apos;s Government suggest that before some fixed date, say the 1st June, 1935,  there should be set up an International Aviation Authority, in which all the signatory Powers would be represented, and by which an appro- priate Governing Body would be elected.  This International Authority would take over the control of all existing or new international air lines and would be responsible for the development of all new international services. Such lines as are at present not self-supporting and these, His Majesty&apos;s Government believe, constitute the vast majority would continue to be paid for by the Governments who are at present paying for them, if those Governments desired that the services-should be continued.  Air lines that are wholly within the territory  of one State might be continued by the State  itself, provided that in doing so the number of aircraft  allocated to the State by the Convention was not surpassed. No State would be permitted, from an agreed date (say the 31st December, 1936), to possess more than a fixed number either of heavy aircraft, that is to say aircraft exceeding a certain weight, or of lighter aircraft,  that is to say aircraft  below a certain weight, the said numbers being laid down for each State in the Convention.   The numbers  to be  allotted might be  determined  by some broad considerations of population and  area.     26.   Arrangements would also have  to  be made  for the International Authority either to register aircraft, to license pilots and mechanics, and owners of aircraft, whether public bodies or individuals, or, alternatively, to record the permitted registrations and licences effected  by Governments.  Appropriate arrangements would also be required for  dealing with matters in dispute raised either by  the International  Authority  or by any  signatory Power, and for examining any infraction or  alleged infraction of the terms of the Convention.     27.   Another  matter which  will  require careful  consideration  by the Disarmament Conference will be the control of manufacture and exportation of aircraft.     28.   The adoption of a scheme on these lines would mitigate the objection that, once war had broken out, a nation  might re-arm and resort to methods of warfare which it is the object of these proposals to abolish.  In theory this is an-objection to which no measure, not even the prohibition of all  aviation,  would provide a complete answer, and it is one that applies to all forms of disarmament, both quantitative  and qualitative.   Nevertheless,  by providing for a  proper relative distribution of civil aircraft, the scheme now presented would ensure that no nation could possess such superiority in the air as to offer a temptation to break the  Convention.  Moreover,  owing to the disappearance  of the highly trained military and naval air forces, many nations would gain a substantial relief by the removal  of all apprehension of a sudden and  overwhelming attack  delivered by an aggressor from the clouds, possibly without warning, and as a first act of war. The elimination of this menace to civilisation should, in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, compensate both nations and individuals for the measures of control now proposed.   :                 &apos;      &quot;:&apos;1&apos;%-,,i!v&apos;.yi.-i&apos;          k\&apos;&apos;-iy[&apos;^\^Z^^     29.   The issue here, as in most political decisions, is a balance of advantage and  disadvantage.  If we desire peace and an enduring sense;of stability,  we must remove those elements of  fear and&apos; insecurity that, beset the world and. stand in the path of disarmament.:  So far as nayies.are concerned, much,has  already been accomplished  by the. Treaties of &quot;Washington and London. to establish a  sane-equilibrium, especially i.between the nations possessing the largest fleets. i0 More
will be accomplished at the Disarmament Conference, particularly if the present proposals should meet with acceptance.  Progress is also being made with LandDisarmament.  In the matter of aviation the problems are even more baffling thanin the case of the older services.  Yet aviation possesses potentialities, particularly as affecting the civilian population,, far outweighing those of navies and armies,and they are the more terrifying because they are unknown    30.  His Majesty&apos;s Government have been led to make their present proposals by a process of exhausting the various possibilities.  By no other method,  so faras warfare in the  air  is concerned, can they see any reasonable  prospect of forestalling an ever-growing menace, of preventing a long-drawn-out and costlycompetition in air armaments, and of promoting at the same time a large reductionin existing armaments.  It is a case of  now or never.  If aviation is to continueunrestricted, vested interests will grow up, and a radical solution of one of the keyproblems  of  disarmament  will  soon  become  impossible.   The  DisarmamentConference cannot ignore the economic state of the world, which overhangs everynation without exception, and menaces its progress and even its standard ofliving.  This is an aspect of the question which they hope will not be overlooked bytheir fellow nations at the Disarmament Conference when they give their attentionto the present proposal.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,         May 26, 1932.
                                     9:  &apos;  :  1&apos;    -   -      -       ;  - - ENCLOSURE II.               , - *PROPOSALS  FOR  HASTENING  THE  WORK  OF  THE  GENERAL                :    DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE.                     Memorandum by the Foreign Office. ,    . - .     THE  Disarmament Conference is  now  in its fourth month and even themost optimistic observer cannot maintain either that past progress has beenrapid or that future prospects are bright.   Indeed,  public  opinion  in most countries tends to under-estimate the value even of  such  successes as have beenpainfully  achieved  and elements normally  favourable  to  disarmament are becoming disillusioned and disinterested and may before long become vocal.     2.   This  is a serious state  of affairs, brought about not only by the  delaysand  hesitations  of the Conference itself,  but  also by  the ever-increasingconcentration of public opinion  on the far more urgent question of the measuresto be taken for the economic regeneration of the world.  The need  for  speed atGeneva was never more urgent.   In the first  place, there is the link of disarma-ment with war debts  through  the United States.  So closely have these two questions been associated in the American public mind that even a partial successby the Disarmament Conference would facilitate in  some  degree a settlement ofthe Debt question with the United  States.  Mr.  Stimson&apos;s anxious concern atthe way in which the  Disarmament Conference is  going is  to a  large  extentprompted by his personal desire that America should not play too unworthy apart when it comes to a re-opening of her debt settlements.  But if disarmamentis to help rather than hinder a settlement of debts and reparations, some tangibleresult should be forthcoming before the end of June.  On the other  hand, a progressive deterioration of the situation at Geneva and a fortiori a  serious clash between  France and Germany would be  bound to make the task of the lausanne conference more difficult if not impossible.     3.   Secondly, it seems  desirable  that  Governments should be at leasttemporarily freed from the endless complexities of the disarmament problem inorder to be able to concentrate on the far more urgent question of assisting by international effort the economic recuperation of the world.     4.   In accordance  with  the Cabinet conclusion of the 11th May,  separatepapers are being submitted with the present memorandum advocating the total abolition of  military aircraft  and the international control  of civil aviation.These proposals, if  adopted, would  furnish the tangible  result referred to in!j 2 above, and,  indeed, they  would constitute  an  impressive success for theDisarmament Conference.  The reduction in world armaments which they wouldinvolve would afford clear proof to  Germany  that we are genuinely seeking areduction as well as a limitation of armaments.  Nevertheless,  in themselves theywould not cover the whole field,  for the problems of naval  and land disarmamentwould remain, and it  is the object of this paper to put  forward other,  if lessambitious, proposals for reaching at all events a temporary settlement as regardsland and sea in order to bring the Conference to an early close.  It  is, moreover,desirable that the proposals  contained  in this paper should be linked  up withthe aviation proposals because the latter, taken by themselves, are likely to meet with French opposition. In association, however, with  a plan for a general andindivisible settlement, they would be more likely of acceptance.     5.   Many factors  have contributed to slow up the work of the Conference,but the chief factor is  its ambitious objective in every field simultaneously.  Wehave been asking Powers met together for the  first time in a general DisarmamentConference not only to set down figures of land, sea and  air armaments whichthey will not surpass for a period of seven to  ten years, but to settle  for the sameperiod what are to  be the future relationships between  sixty Powers in sucharmaments.  Faced with such a problem for the first  time, every General staff and Naval Staff has necessarily to ask for a figure which takes account of allpossible  future contingencies and looks with alarm  on  the figures put in by itsneighbour.     6.   The  experience  of the London Naval  Conference goes to show  that a.better method is to eschew all question of principle and all attempt to lay down       [7051]                                                       c
 any lasting relationship of naval or military strength, and simply to declare that on  a certain date a few years hence the armaments which each signatory will possess will not exceed x.  The date should not be too far distant in the case of the London Naval Treaty  it was the 3ist December, 1936.  The figure x to be inserted must not be higher than the. average budget figures of the last y years expressed in terms of men and materials.* For Great Britain,  the United&apos; States and Japan, the Washington and  London  Naval  Treaty figures would stand, provided that an agreement can be reached with France and Italy on the lines of that still under consideration.     7.  If the date of the 31st December, 1936, were chosen as the date  for the termination of  the  General Disarmament  Convention,  the naval  and military advisers of the various Governments would  only have to look ahead for 4^ years from the date of signature (say from next July).  They would  be able to  rely on a definite understanding that no permanent relationships  were being established and that the figure to be inserted for December  1936, would not be a figure which their country would in no circumstances be allowed to surpass  in the future.     8.  There would be  a further General Disarmament Conference in  June 1935, which might follow on the Naval Conference expected to  meet early in that year and which would lay down what is to  happen for the period beginning the 1st January,  1937.    Economic conditions should meantime  have exercised a moderating influence on the more recalcitrant Powers and the General Conference of 1935 might open with  a much better prospect than the  present Conference of achieving all round reductions in armaments.     9.  So far this  memorandum has dealt  only with quantitative  disarmament, because this is the great problem with which no progress at all has  been made up to date at the  Disarmament  Conference.    The  consideration of qualitative disarmament is now under way.  Should the result be  to prohibit, as offensive weapons and vessels and  practices at present forbidden to Germany,  we should have gone a long way to meet Germany&apos;s claim for equality of rights and Germany could reasonably be expected to accept the not completely  satisfactory, quantita- tive limitation proposed  in paragraph 6 above.     10.  Unfortunately,  however,  the  probabilities are  that each Power  will exclude from  the proscribed list the weapon or vessel in which it is especially interested, with the result that a General Conference will  have declared that the weapons forbidden to Germany are  not specifically aggressive.   In  such an  event we can with  perfect justice turn  to France,  which has  taken a leading party in advocating the defensive  qualities of big guns and tanks, and urge that as iti! has been agreed that these weapons are not specifically aggressive, there can beI no reason in equity  for refusing to modify  the military  clauses of the VersaillesI Treaty to the extent of permitting Germany to possess any arms which the present :- Conference has  refused to proscribe as specifically offensive.  Germany would not of course, be permitted to  increase either her total of effectives or  of  guns or of tonnage,, but, within those  existing limitations, she would be allowed if she wished to  utilise the same types of weapons permissible to other Powers.     11.  In this way Germany would achieve &quot; Gleichberechtigung &quot; without adding greatly  to her offensive powers.  France would find it  difficult  long to resist such a proposal if backed by world opinion as being a reasonable compensa- tion to  Germany  for  the  failure  of  the Geneva  Conference  to  make any considerable reduction in  naval and land armaments at the present  time.     12.  Prance&apos;s  assent  to this modification  of the Military Clauses of the Treaty of Versailles might more easily  be secured if it were to be simultaneously proposed that the political truce suggested in Sir R. Vansittart&apos;s memorandum of  the -1st&apos;January last  should be observed  for the  period  proposed  for  the Disarmament Convention, i!e\  up to the 31st December,  1936.  A copy of the draft  declaration there proposed is attached for convenience  of reference.     * NOTE. In the case of land armaments, the guiding-figures cquldbe the.total effectives \with  the colours.and the budgetary expenditure on material.  In the case of naval armaments, the guiding figures for Powers other than those represented at the London Naval Conference could  be the average tonnage by  categories possessed  by those Powers over?/ years and tjie average annual construction in all categories during the same period.
    13.  The idea.of a political truce is believed to have been under consideration in France from time to time,,&apos; but has failed of late to arouse much enthusiasmowing to fears that a future German Government would fail to honour in sucha matter the obligation assumed by its predecessor.  But French sentiment on\\this point might well undergo a change if the idea of a political truce were to bellre-enforced  by  some  system of  mutual  guarantees between  the  interested/!Continental States.   M.  Paul-Boncour&apos;s recent references  to  the idea of  a&apos;Continental Association  in  a conversation with  the  Prime Minister and in apublic speech are at least encouraging in this respect.  But the plan would be along and difficult matter to  work out and we might suggest that this should bedone in the interval between  the end of the present Conference and the opening ofthe Conference suggested for 1935.    14.  The above plan, which it is suggested should in the first instance be putforward  privately to  the French  as a  sincere effort to secure  Anglo-french -operation all along the line, may therefore be summarised as follows :     (1) Abolition of military aircraft and  strict international  control of civil           aviation (see separate papers circulated herewith).    (2) Limitation of the objectives of the Disarmament Conference in the other           fields by abandoning for the moment any idea  of  fixing levels of           strength which may never in the future be exceeded, and relationships           between the armaments  of  different  Powers which may come to be           regarded  as permanent.  Instead of  seeking a  general convention,           which would  remain in force  for  seven or ten  years, we should           advocate, in view of the difficulties which have arisen at Geneva, that           our objective  should be  limited to  a  Convention  containing  a           declaration by all the Powers of the armaments which each  would           possess on the 31st December, 1936, on the understanding that such           armaments  should in no case be higher than the average figures of the           last y years.    (3) Should the present discussions  in  regard  to qualitative  disarmament           result in a  decision of the Disarmament Conference that there is no           weapon or  vessel which can be proscribed on the ground that it  is           specifically  aggressive, this would strengthen the case in equity  for an           amendment in the military clauses of the Versailles Treaty to permit           the use by Germany of those weapons and vessels which were forbidden           to her in that Treaty. If military aircraft were to be abolished, this           dispensation to Germany would of course be limited to naval and land           armaments.    (4) A further General Disarmament Conference  should meet  in June 1935,           and might  follow immediately on the Naval Conference, which  will           meet early in that year.    (5) To make No. 2 more palatable to France a &quot; political truce &quot; (see annex)           should be proposed for the period up to the 31st December, 1936.    (6) The interval between the  two Conferences should  be  occupied  in an          endeavour by the Powers of continental Europe to set up Associations           for assuring their greater security by agreeing as between themselves           on  provisions  for mutual assistance on the Locarno or some other           model.

INCREASINGLY impressed by the urgent necessity for establishingconfidence and good understanding between nations;    2.

     3.   Gravely disturbed by the dangers with which Europe will be threatenedshould  the present  crisis  continue,  and  convinced that, the  overwhelminglyimportant interest of peoples  is the immediate economic reconstruction of theContinent as a whole;     4.   The Governments of........................make the  following declaration,in which it is hoped that the other Powers of Europe will join:     5.   During  a period of five/ten years they solemnly agree to subordinatetheir old differences to the promotion of their common welfare,  to refrain fromactions likely to revive past quarrels or to bring existing agreements into thefield of polemics, and generally to renounce and discountenance all proceedingsliable to disturb good relations.     6.   The gravity of this  present  crisis  has  already had  the  effect  ofestablishing between the economic and financial centres of the signatory  countries,contacts of an intimate and friendly  nature,  and in order  to  strengthen thisentente the signatory Governments will, during the said period, exert themselvesto give these contacts a still  greater and more methodical development.  To thisend  they agree to meet periodically for direct exchange of views on any matterof common importance.
f. o .                               ENCLOSURE III.SUGGESTED   DRAFT   CONVENTION  FOR  THE   ABOLITION  OF     MILITARY  AIRCRAFT  AND  THE  INTERNATIONALISATION     OF  CIVIL  AVIATION.     CONVINCED that only through the complete abolition of military aircraft(that is to say,  aircraft which has been constructed for any warlike purpose or which forms or  can form a part of the fighting forces of any State), and through such measures for the internationalisation and/or co-ordination of civil aviation,as will prevent  the use of civil aircraft for warlike  purposes, can the world be preserved  from the ever-increasing  menace of attack from the air, the HighContracting Parties have agreed to sign, ratify and  bring  into force within sixmonths from this date the following  Convention.                                      I.     The High Contracting Parties pledge themselves  to the complete abolitionof all aircraft  for warlike purposes before the 31st December, 1936.   By the1st June, 1934 and the 1st June, 1935, they will destroy one-third and two-thirdsrespectively of their  existing military aircraft, and the remaining third by the31st December, 1936.                                     II.     The High Contracting Parties declare that the use of civil aircraft, either for bombardment or for any other direct or indirect warlike purpose whatsoever,is prohibited.  Any person using aircraft for such a purpose shall  be guilty of aserious crime both under international law and under the municipal laws of theHigh Contracting States, to be dealt with as provided under III (e) below.                                     III.     In order to bring about through international co-operation the developmentof civil aviation and  to prevent all  possibility of civil aviation constituting awarlike  menace  in  the future, the  High  Contracting Parties  agree to thefollowing  measures  of  internationalisation   and/or  co-ordination  of  civilaviation :      (a) Before the 1st June, 1935,  there shall be set up an international aviation authority in which all the Signatory Powers shall be represented and  by which an appropriate  governing body would be elected;     (b) The international authority shall take over the control of all existing or new international air lines,  and be responsible for the development of all new international lines. Such lines as are at present not self-supporting shall continueto be paid for by the Governments at present paying for them, if those Govern -ments desire that the lines shall be continued;     (c) Air  lines that are wholly within  the territory of one State may  bemaintained by the State itself, provided that by doing sc the number of aircraftallocated to the State by this Convention is not surpassed;     (d) Apart from aircraft  controlled by the international authority, no state shall be permitted, as from the 31st December, 1936, to possess more than thefollowing numbers of, aircraft, whether State-owned or privately owned :       (i) In the case of heavy aircraft, that is,  aircraft the weight  of which           exceeds x lbs., States with a population of above  y millions or an area           of above z  square miles, p machines.   States Avith  a population           inferior to y millions and  an area of z square miles, q machines;     (ii) In the case  of lighter aircraft, that is, aircraft  not exceeding x lbs.,           States the population of which exceeds y millions or the area of which           exceeds z square miles, m machines.   States the  population  of which           does  not exceed y millions and  the area of which does not exceed           z square miles, n  machines.               [N.B. These categories are merely given as illustrations.]
                                     1-i    (e) The international authority shall alone be authorised to register aircraft and to licence pilots and mechanics and owners of aircraft, whether public bodies or individuals, or, alternatively, to record the permitted registrations and licenceseffected by Governments.  If the former alternative is adopted, application forsuch registration  and such licences shall, unless it is otherwise decided by theState concerned,  pass through the  competent Department of the: Government ofthat State to  the  international  body with a recommendation from that Depart-ment.  Any person who either obtains possession of, or flies  or maintains a machine without  such licence shall be guilty of a serious offence against bothinternational law and against the municipal law  of the State to which he belongsand the State  in the territory of which the offence is committed, and shall be liableto a punishment of not less than x years&apos; penal servitude;    (/) There shall take place  yearly, if  any Signatory Power so desires it, ameeting  of  representatives of all the Signatory Powers  of  this Convention toexamine matters in dispute referred to them by the international authority or byany Signatory Power.  This  conference shall appoint a supervisory commissionof x persons,  holding office for  one year, whose duty it shall be to examine anyinfraction or  alleged infraction of the terms of this Convention, and to report at once such infraction both to  the international authority and to the signatory governments.   The Signatory Powers pledge themselves to give every facility tothis supervisory commission to examine alleged infractions  within their respective-territories;    (g) The export of aircraft  from one country to another is forbidden except with the authorisation of the international authority, whose duty it shall be tosee that  no  export of aircraft to, or manufacure of aircraft for, another Statetakes  place  in  the   territory  of a Signatory  State  without  the  necessaryinternational authorisation.    The amount of aircraft under construction at any given moment by one Statefor another State shall not exceed x per cent, of the total amount allocated to the^former State.
