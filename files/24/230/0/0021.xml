w is* *P we *ss - *** W* MOST IMMEDIATE. Mo.67.  Secret,    Your telegram 26th May Secret md Personal-   The Nationalist want the elections to be held because they are confident of victory.   The  Constitutional and Labour Parties want them because they  regard every vote cast in their favour as so much evidence of condemnation of the Bishops&apos;  action and also because they fear that if the elections are stayed the result may be the permanent withdrawal of the Constitution.   The only body to whom the suspension of  the elections would be  a matter of equanimity, in fact of satisfactions is the Church who realise that her privileged position is more likely to be maintained under Crown Colony Government than when it is subject to Parliamentary criticism.   The  position moreover differs in an important respect from  that of  1930  in that the Royal Commissioners unfortunately made their recommendation in favour of the restoration of the Constitution an unconditional one and although their expectations have been falsified the recommendation was accepted by !I.M.government in the form in which it was made.   You will  realise that the die i si on of the Cabinet places me in a very difficult position in that the determination to proceed with elections is only point  on which all PartieB are united.   Strongly worded memorandum from the Constitutional  and Labour Parties in this  connection is being telegraphed to you to-day.    But of far greater importance than my difficulties is the future if thens^KiSr T?endSd;   Xt Would mean that ihe ^Aatoral wouldvotSS ^tlmtSy ln force* elections would net take place grounds*&amp;3^^              ***** -*M * Preventer                                                 ConsequentiallyPARAPHRASE TSLEORAM from the Governor of Malta to the Secretary ofState for the Colonies                 Dated 27th May,  1932,(Received Colonial Office  4.12 p.m.  27th May,   1932.)
Consequentially  the Bishops attitude would remain unassailefor an  indefinite period since it is my belief that theycan only  be dislodged  from their present position by meansof ultimate victory at pome future election of the GcmoactParties,   In oth-?r words freedom of Maltese electorate canonly be.won from within, not from without, and this canonly haopen if elections allowed to take place0           I &apos;?rast that in your considered announcement youwill denounce in strongest possible terms the Bishops&apos;unwarranted pretensions and will emphasise their bad faithvis-a-vis  the royal Commi s:-i oners.

Telegram sent en, clair by the Governor of Malta tothe Secretary or State for the Colonies,!. 50 p. m. 27thof May 41932.68 Following message has been addressed to me for transmission to you by Secretaries Constitutional  andLabour parties and is telegraphed at their request and expense begins : On behalf of the Constitutional andLabour parties we wish to assure Vour Excellency thatthe opinions held by the parties wholly  endorse ourleaders views expressed to Your Excellency that thepending elections in Malta should take place with  theleast possible delay notwithstanding the Bishop1 s  Circularreaffirming their mortal sin pastoral of May 1930  andtheir consequent ban on the Electorateo  we  hold that since May 1930 the people of Malta and Gozo  have had timeto learn without the sudden and angry upheaval that thepastoral in the form a bombshell then caused how to discriminate where the Bishops authority ends and  where thpeoples political freedom begins.  We hold that the Bishophave forfeited their right to have an undue share  in theGovernment of the country to the detriment of the  rightsof the democracy and they will reacquire their formerundue power and enjoy undue prestige indefinitely  if their ultra clerical friends wishing to save them fromdefeat  both here and in England succeed in suspending theElections for any cause whatsoever. We would point outthat the Vatican policy is opposed to self government in malta whatever declarations may be made locally to thecontrary.  In other countries the elimination of undue                                                    moral
19 0loomoral pressure on the part of ecclesiastics has comefrom the people. There is now overy reason to anticipate that one or two general elections in rapid succession mayeliminate undue clerical influence permanently without serious incidents.  Elections ?.re made possible so loras the police force are forbidden to take-orders fromecclesiastics and so long as piblic meetings are allowedaccording to lav.; and not cancelled preferentially forpurposes of obstruction or ih favour of religiousprocess lone or so called piiferiTisges   between parishes.The Constitutional and the Labour parties who wore in office at the expiration of the last parliament have every reason to believe that they will gain at least.haig if not more of the seats cf the Legislative AssemblyY/hether we gain slightly more or less we are confidentnow of an amount of calm support in the country that maymake the burden of the pastoral of May 1930 a matter ofindifference,  Ail Labourites aid many Constitutionalsprefer the election with the pastoral in. order to endonce for all undue clerical influence in Malta., the reaction against the abuse of spiritual power and theepiscopal persecution that our  supporters had sufferedsince the suspension of the elections in 1930 is verypronounced.  We hold strongly that any suspension of theelection on the part of the Imperial Government would beact of partiality in favour of the bishops and a most unjand severe punishment would thereby be Inflicted on thepeople of Malta before they have enjoyed the opportunityto express their views at the polls according to therecommendations of the Royal Commission,  Moreover the                                               suspension
suspension of the election would introduce chronic  chaosin Malta and increase the discontent against theprovisional government that would have to provide protection lor the bishops of Malta and Gozoo   We holdthat an election with the pastoral and with the pronounceddisregard thereof by undoubtedly thousands of the peopleof Malta and Gozo will be a great blow to the bishopsaction in Malta which ultimately may convince the Vaticanthat they are no more enjoying the confidence of theirflock.  Notwithstanding that the leaders of all parties in Malta appear to desire an immediate election thereare indications that the curia and extreme pro ItalianNationalists are insincere when they side for an election./The British parties can only survive under self government under this His Majesty&apos;s Government may rest assured ofa strong and live opposition to the Italian intrigues withecclesiasticals and others. The Italian Governmentsobjective is the supremacy of Italian in Malta in  orderto organize a &quot;block&quot; of Italian speaking Maltese migrantsin North Africa^  The Maltese objective is to furtherestablish the supremacy of British culture essential for our working classes and to establish our unimpeachableloyalty to the British Crown signed Alfred Gera De  petriHonorary secretary Constitutional party Giovanni BenciniSecretary Labour party message ends.
