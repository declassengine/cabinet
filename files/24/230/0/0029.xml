THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT                    Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1932.20GSECRET.                                                Copy No.CP.  181 (32).CABINET.Disarmament  Conference,  1932.                              DISARMAMENT.            MEMORANDUM  BY THE  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  AIR.     IT has not been possible, within the time available  since the circulation of Paper CP. 164 (32), to formulate detailed comments upon the enclosures dealing with Air Disarmament and Proposals  for hastening the work of  the General Disarmament Conference.     A preliminary study of the Proposals for Air Disarmament shows that they have been framed so as to meet as far  as possible the objections which led the Cabinet Committee on Disarmament two months ago to record the conclusion that the internationalisation of civil aviation was &quot; not a practicable proposal.&quot;  How far success has been achieved in  meeting these objections my advisers are now considering.  I  feel bound, however, to state  at  once what I believe  to  be overwhelming arguments of principle against these proposals; arguments beside which technical opinion, however necessary to a final decision, must be of secondary importance.     2.   The main difficulties of the problem rest on one fundamental fact, which I am sure my colleagues have by  now appreciated, and1 which I will venture to state once more  in the words of C.P. 164  (32) :           &quot; Even the abolition of military and naval aviation, however, taken  by     itself, would not be sufficient, since in that event civil aircraft would dominate     the air, and an overwhelming advantage would rest with those nations whose     conditions are favourable for the maintenance of a large civil aviation.&quot;     Unless, in fact, a rigorous restriction and control are  to be exercised over the numbers used in transport, travel, recreation and sport, civil aircraft will increase until aviation,  by sheer numbers and bomb-carrying  capacity, will constitute a potential menace  of the  first magnitude.  Conversely, if this development is  to be prevented, flying must be crippled and circumscribed, and mankind must forego the incalculable advantages its free development  promises to the world in  times of peace.     Mere equality in numbers and in industrial resources between nations, even  J if we could achieve that, would utterly fail to  remove  the air menace from war.     3.  I have ample opportunity of appreciating not only the strength of the appeal  of  flying  to  the  younger  generation  (and to  many who  are  not young), but also the recent enormous increases in regular air travel.   I doubt whether it is generally realised that there has been  a ten-fold increase in the passengers in American air lines in four years  (they now total half  a million annually), a four-fold increase in the number  of American civil aircraft in fiveyears to more than 10,000, a more than four-fold increase in privately-owned air- craft in Great  Britain within four years, and  a fifteen-fold  increase in thenumbers visiting the continent in these private aircraft within the same period. These rates of increase are indeed amazing, and are not peculiar to America andGreat Britain.    These figures mean  that  if the  present  rate  is maintained (and it can scarcely  fail to be increased by  scientific developments and by advances in      [7072]
 methods  of cheap ^production), within  20  years we  shall  have thousands of privateiy-owned  aeroplanes  in  this country  and tens of thousands of  persons annually will travel in aircraft between this country and the mainland of Europe  to aay nothing of contacts which air communication will  provide in steadily increasing measure with other countries and continents.  Those of my colleagues who fly regularly themselves will agree that long-distance travel is already vastly more attractive,  and convenient than in the  old  days.   Just as the growth of private motoring in the last 30 years has expanded our knowledge of our own country, so the growth of private flying is expanding our knowledge of  other countries, to a degree impossible so long as we were confined to travel along the surface of the earth.     Except that each of these aircraft is a potential weapon in war, nothing but good can come to the world from the great prospective increase  in the contacts between a nation and its neighbours.   There is nothing more likely to remove the provincial and insular outlook, or cure  the narrow economic nationalism which are at the root of most of the world&apos;s troubles.     4.   The  proposals now  put forward, if they are to  be given  even the appearance of effectiveness,  must entail impossibly  low numerical limits  upon the numbers of private  aircraft allowed to each State, and will, in  my  view, involve a truly appalling degree of interference with individual  liberty and of restriction of the lawful and beneficent enjoyment of flying.    It  is  unthinkable that, as  proposed in  the Draft  Convention,  private citizens  should be  prevented (on  pain of  penal  servitude) from  acquiring aeroplanes and touring their own and other countries in peace for  the sole reason that the vehicles on  which they will travel are potential weapons which niay be misused by their Governments in the event of war.    It is vitally important to reduce  the air menace, and  if Air Forces are to be abolished, I do not question that a  vigorous application of the  very  provision which I am criticising would be a logical and necessary step (although one which would still leave the air menace free to develop  at the outbreak of war).  I do, however,  feel bound to urge my view that so long  as  we retain any  sense of proportion between the everyday requirements of peace and the possible evils of war we cannot advocate, at home or abroad, a proposal involving such restrictions on the natural evolution of scientific development.    Yet these restrictions, while they  might appear to reduce the  visible menace in peace time, would do nothing to remove  the  certainty that every  industrial nation would maintain  plans for building  up  an&quot; air &quot;force immediately  war broke out.    5.  There is another aspect to these proposals, and one which I feel boundto bring forward at the first opportunity.    I am convinced that even if we  advocate the total abolition of  air forces on these conditions there is but little chance of  their acceptance.  Leaving outof account the French attitude, I cannot believe that America, who  sees in aircraftnot a threat&apos;to cities, but a means of solving one of the greatest difficulties in the government of a Continent, will accept the necessary restrictions upon civil flying.    It may seem that the improbability of their general acceptance renders  these proposals less objectionable than I have  made them appear.   With.this view I cannot agree.   We cannot be blind even  at times like these to the  future welfare of the service which my department administers and controls.  If it is announced as the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the Royal Air Force should be abolished, and if  it later transpires that the only obstacle is the attitude of one or two foreign countries, the Air Service will be under a kind of suspended death sentence which  would  have  the  most detrimental effects  oh&apos; its efficiency, on future recruitment  and on  the  morale  of officers  and men.  I feel  sure my colleagues will realise the great importance  and extreme  delicacy of this last factor.                                  ,,    We  ought to be very sure that we shall have  iio heed of the Royal Air Force after this Conference is over, before we  risk shaking its stability  in the manner proposed.    6.   While fully appreciating both  the  Urgent necessity  for a substantial measure of air  disarmament, and the difficulty of achieving it  under present
conditions, I ask my. colleagues to agree with,me that the virtual suppression ofcivil aviation, without,which it is admittedly impracticable to abolish air forces,is too high a price to pay for the illusion of security.               . ;    I urge them, moreover,  not to overrate the probability of&quot; the acceptance by-America and France of this proposal if it is put forward, and to remember thatmerely to put it forward in the expectation that it will not be accepted will,beto strike a serious blow, not only at the spirit of the. Royal &quot;Air Forced but&apos;at&quot;the traditional integrity which hitherto has been the hall mark of British foreignpolicy...              &apos;                                          &apos;  &apos;.&apos;/&quot;&quot;    7.  If it is  decided, as  1 hope it may be, to seek some other way out of our difficulties, I believe there is an alternative.  I believe that the most practicablesolution lies in combining and developing the other proposals referred  to by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs in CP. 164 (32), namely -.-             , .      (i) As a qualitative measure of disarmament, a reduction in the maximum           permissible size of aircraft.   Such a measure would prevent for  all           time  those competitive developments in bulk and consequent cost of :           equipment which  have been  so  burdensome in the case  of; naval           armaments.     (ii) A limitation in the permissible  scale of armaments on the basis of the           average budget figures for the last few years.    (iii) The prohibition of bombardment of the. civil population.I appreciate that the codification of rules restricting all bombardment (whetherfrom land, sea or air) of military objectives may be criticised on the ground thatit does not bear directly enough upon the specific  problem of limitation  and reduction.  I am, however,  convinced  that  a clear  definition of legitimateobjectives  for bombardment and the promulgation of a  code reasonable  and practical in its teimas and recognising the legitimate uses of aircraft against themilitary activities  of a belligerent country would attain  a degree  of  authority which no belligerent in his own interests  would think it profitable to defy.   Theexistence of such  a code might  have  far-reaching results.  For  instance, - all nations  might  gradually  demilitarise   lai&apos;ge  areas   of  the population  byguaranteeing that no  military activities would  take  place  within  them -aguarantee which could be watched  over by observers  appointed under neutralauspices.    8.   I cannot claim that my alternative proposals are as striking as those ofthe Secretary of State  for  Foreign  Affairs, but they are, in my view, very farfrom representing  a policy  of drift.  I have no doubt  that it  is along  moderateand practical lines such as these that we shall do most  to protect civilisationfrom the worst effects of war, with the least harm to its development in: peace.                   -.,  -   pi    &apos;  :&apos;    - -  ^         .     1 SKKSSifiilS &apos;     Air Ministry, May 31,  1932.
