          THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL informed theCommittee that in response to a request by a member ofthe old Nationalist Party for an interview with thePrime Minister? he,, Ux\o Baldwin, had seen the- gentlemanin question on May 7th and had been informed &quot;by him thatthere was a very general impression throughout the IrishFree State that whatever might be the fate of the Bill,the Free State would continue to enjoy the benefits ofthe 10$ preferences after the 15th November next.  Inthe opinion of this gentleman it was very desirable that *SH SITUATION   1.        With reference to I.S,CC(32) 3rd Meeting- theMITTEE.

public opinion in. the Free State should know-precisely what the true position was before the Billcame before the Senate.  It would, however, in &quot;his view be unwise that any declaration should be madein the United Kingdom Parliament and his suggestion was that some prominent member of Mr. Gosgr-ave?s party should stabe in the Dail that he understood on very good authority that in the event of the Oath Eillbecoming law it was the intention of the UnitedKingdom Government to take action which would have theeffect of gravely imperilling the temporary preferencewhich the Free State now enjoyed under the ImportDuties Acto          The Lord President of the Council said thathe had replied to the effect that he personally sawlittle objection to this proposal, provided however,that any action was taken with Mra Cosgrave&apos;s fullknow3.edge and assent.  His informant had according^promised at once to get into touch with Mra Cosgraveand had. intimated that he personally was not in theleast alarmed at the prospect of a General election in the Free State as he was convinced that whenpublic opinion realised the full implications of  Mr0de Va?n&apos;installera&apos;s policy there would be a strong reaction in favour of the return to power of Mr0 Cosgrave andhis colleaguesn       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS3aid that he was very doubtful whether the gentlemanin question was really in a position to speak for Mr,Cosgraveo  The suggestion which he had made had, infact, been discussed with Mr,, 0&apos;S.uilivan who had expressed a very definite opinion that for any member
of Mr, Cosgrave&apos;s Tarty to make such a statement inthe Dail would, do more harm than good.  It v/ould he pointed out on &quot;behalf cf the Free State Government that so far the United Kingdom had given no indication what-ever of the kind indicated, and Mr., Cocgrave would be accused of having suggested to the United Kingdom apolicy which hut for his suggestion might never havebeen adoptedo  Hef Mr. Thomas, saw no value whateverin the proposal and doubted moreover whether anyprominent member of Mr, Cosgrave&apos;s Party would, inpresent circumstances, take the grave risk of making such a statement in the Dailo        The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs reminded the Committde that in his Memorandum (l0SoCc(52)15) he had assumed that the policy of the UnitedKingdom ought to be based on the view that Mr&apos;9 de valera, &quot;by securing the passage of the present Bill,had not yet pub the Irish Free State out of theBritish Commonwealth and that the question for the Committeeto consider v/as the possibility of imposing sanctionsappropriate to the position under which, whileremainixig within the Commonwealth, the Irish Free state had broken the Treaty,  If subsequent action by theIrish Free Sta^e clearly indicated that tney intendedto set up a Republic, the whole situation would be changed, o       On this assumption he, Mr. Thomas, invited the Committee to consider whether steps might now betaken to indicate that as the Irish Free State have showntheir intention to disregard their existing engagements;it is impossible for us to enter into fresh engagements with them or even to discuss with them the negotiation of such fresh engagements0 (loSoGa(33) 16 para. 4 (i)).
       It was possible that the Oath Bill might become law within the next fortnight.  The Government of theIrish Free State would then be concerned with the passageof their Budget and towards the end of June the questionof the Land Purchase Annuities would have to be faced,In his, Mr, Thomas!Sj, view it was imperative that theGovernment of the United Kingdom should now decide  on  thekind of action which would have to be taken on the  Billbecoming law, and as a first step he thought that themoment had arrived when that Government must considerthe question of making some kind of declaration of  their intentions ,       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat it seemed clear that if Mr, de Valera carried  out his policy regarding the Oath of Allegiance and the land annuities, the United Kingdom Government would be forcedby pressure of circumstances to take some action not later than June next and the immediate question was whether some indication should now be given of the nature of that action,,  Within the last few days the United Kingdom hadbeen strongly urged to make a declaration both by Mr3McCloughlin and Mr, 0&apos;Sullivan,  He, Sir John Simonsentirely agreed that it would be unwise to d.ecide to makea declaration until it was known precisely what that declaration was to cover.   He personally did not think thatthe Committee ought to rale out from consideration themaking of some immediate authoritative declaration,       THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER thought that theGovernment were approaching a most embarrassing and difficult situation,,  It, was quite clear that the actionwhich Mr, de Valera&apos;s Government was now taking in no wayrepresented the whole of their policjr,,  It was understood,for example, that the Free State Government were consideringthe legal position with regard to the Royal Irish
Constabulary  Pensions and  they might also, he expected toexamine  the position with  regard to other matters, such asthe Local Loans Fund.   That Government seemed to have no hesitation whatever in  breaking any solemn agreements thatmight have been entered into between the Irish Free Stateand the  United Kingdom  and we must anticipate that theywould be prepared to go considerably farther in thisdirection than they had gone already,  It was unthinkablethat the Government of  the United Kingdom could continuepassively to  acquiesce  in  such a state of affairs.  If action was not  taken before it would have to be taken at the ottawa conference and surely it would be most unwise to allow the situation to drift and most unfair to Mro Cosgrave&apos;party and^also to Mr. de Valerafs Government not to give thpslatter now a  very grave warning of the consequences of theprocedure which they had adopted.  He, Mr. Chamberlain,  wasnot in favour of taking any immediate action of a drasticcharacter but he was convinced that the time hed come when an authoritative warning of the kind which he had indicatedshould be issued and he suggested that this could best bedone by means of a Question and Answer in Parliament.If the Committee agreed that it was impossible to acquiesce in the continuance of the  present state of affairs, was it also agreed that, in- view  of what was certain to happen^we should not continue  to  give the Irish Free State.the^benefit  of the temporary preferences under the ImportDuties Act?          In  reply to the Home Secretary, who enquire whether  there were any  payments due from the United kingdom to the Irish  Free State which might be set off against with-held payments such as the  Land Annuities, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer intimated that the only payments were for services rendered by Departments and were of a triflingamount.
       THE SECRETARY OF STATE  FOR  DOMINION AFFAIRS. pointed out  that the proposal of  the  Chancellor of the Exchequer was,  in  substance, identical with  that suggested on the  second page  of his Memorandum (I.S.0.(32)  16.).     A warning given now that  the  temporary preferences under the Import Duties Act would cease  to  operate in the case  of the  Irish Free  State  might be adequate to meet the  situation  caused by the passage of the Oath Bill, hut would it not also be necessary to consider the  imposition of further sanctions (for example, a  duty on cattle imported from the Irish  Free State)  in  the  event of the land annuities being  withheld.         -       THE  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR &quot;WAR said that while in theory  he  was entirely favourable to the imposition of sanctions, his difficulty was to find effective sanctions which could be imposed without harming  the United Kingdom to a substantial- ly greater extent than  they harmed the Irish Free State.      In this connection LordHailsham  referred to the warning contained in the Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade  (L..P.A. (32) 4) as to the serious repercussions on important  United Kingdom trades of a tariff war &quot;between the United Kingdom and the Free State, especially as the latter would have no difficulty whatever  in obtaining from other countries
manufactured goods  and  other  supplies which, atpresent, she obtains from the United Kingdom.     THE CHANCELLOR OP  THE EXCHEQUER thought thatthe first step should he to give  the Irish FreeState a grave warning on the  subject of the continu-ance of the present temporary preferences.     THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL thought thatthis was as far as  the Government could and need goat the present moment.  It would be most undesirable to engage in a tariff war with the Free State and.it must be realised that if, otice a tariff warstarted it would, undoubtedly s be of a very bitter.nature.   He agreed however, with the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs that it was Impossible for theGovernment to continue to acquiesce in what Mro cbValera was doing.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR &quot;WAR reminded theCommittee that the  issues raised by the Oath bill were far wider than the mere question of the taking of the Oath of Allegiance.   Our complaint againstthe Government of the Irish Free State was thatthat Government was taking steps publicly tpremove the statutory obligations binding them to observe and carry out the Treaty.   In view of their action in this respect it would be only logical for the
United Kingdom G-cvernment to say that no useful purpose would be served by their entering into -negotiations or making fresh bargains with aGovernment which had just shown in unmistakablefashion that it could not be relied upon to keepthe most solemn engagements. .     THE HOLCS SECRETARY agreed that it was impossibleto allow the present situation to continue and itwas possible that the course suggested was the best solution, but it would be necessary to consider very carefully  the consequences of the policy, if adopted.Jas it suggested that in our view the Treaty was nolonger operative and that in effect the Irish FreeState had, by their action; placed themselves outsidethe Empire?   Did we intend by the suggested declaration to suggest that the Irish Free State should not go tothe Ottawa Conference?   He doubted whether we couldtreat the Treaty as a purely bilateral agreement be-tween the Irish Free State and the United Kingdom andhe felt that, in practice, it was impossible to omit the other Dominions from any consideration of theproblem.     THE SECRETARY OB1 STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that the answer to the Home 8ecretary&apos;s first and second questions were in the negative and pointed outthat the Cabinet had been unanimous in the view thatthe Treaty was a bilateral agreement befo7een theUnited Kingdom and the Irish Free State.   The otherDominions were not parties to the Treaty and anyattempt to treat them now as if they had been partiesthereto would raise very dangerous and embarrassingconstitutional and  /
political questions,   The Irish fresh State would goto the Ottawa Conference on the invitation of theCanadian Govemraant and not an the invitation ofthe Government of the United Kingdom,   It was opento the United Kingdom Delegates at that conference to say that? owing to the action of the Irish FreeState, the United Kingdom could not negotiate withthe Irish Free State at the Conference, hut that ifthe other Dominions liked to negotiate and enterinto arrangements with the Irish Free State itwouldj of course, be open for them to do sc     THE CHANCELLOR OF TEL EXCHEQUER read to theCommittee the following Question which he proposed should be ashed in the House of Commons3 and the answer to that Question as suggested by him&quot;QUESTION;   Whether, if the Bill to abolish   the Cath is passed by the Irish Parliament^   it is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s   Government to enter into negotiations with   the Irian Government with a view to   preventing the ad valorem and additional   duties becoming operative against the   Irish Free State on the 15th November., ANSYiTSRs      His Majesty&apos;1&apos;s Go-rarnment  have already   eiqpi^esaed the view that the action of the   Irish Government ie a direct breach  of their   obligation under the Anglo-Irish Treaty,   It appears to His Majesty&apos;s Government that   it would be unreasonable to expect that   they should enter into negotiations  for   further agreements with a Government   which has repudiated an agreement already   e rit e re d i nt o. n
        THE SECRETARY 0? STATIS FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thought  that, it was desirable to make it clear in the Answer that the continuance of the Dominion Preference after the 15th November next will be subject to new agreements having been reached as a result of negotiations srfc Ottawa in the case of all the Dominions.        THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS enquired whether -the Answer proposed would be sufficient not only as covering the Oath Bill, but in the event of the Land Annuities being withheld in June next.        THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that it was not necessary or desirable at the moment for the Government to make up their minds with regard to possible sanctions  in the event  of-the Annuities being withheld, end suggested that the effect of the proposed question aril Answer should first be seen.  It  appeared to him that the only practicable scheme for further sanctions was a duty on cattle imported from the Irish Free State.  This undoubtedly would be the first step in a very bitter tariff war.        THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE pointed out that any such proposal would place a very serious burden on the United Kingdom live stock industry.        THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he felt very considerable doubt with regard to the repercussions of the policy proposed on the other Dominions.   He fully appreciated that the Government must either take some action or continue the policy of complete non-interference, and he did not dissent from the view that the latter policy was impracticable and that in the events which had happened, it would not be feasible for the United Kingdom  to negotiate new agreements with the Irish Free State,   He felt, however, that any measure, however/
 justifiable,  which the United Kingdom Government might take would merely  have the effect of stiffening Mr.  de Valera and his  supporters.   The questions at issue would not be argued in the Free State on their merits, but it would be said that the declaration of the Government of the United Kingdom  was a threat to prevent the passage of the Oath Bill.      Till- CHANCELLOR 0? THE EXCHEQUER thought that it would be very  difficult, even for an Irishman, to argue that what was proposed  amounted to interference by the United Kingdom in the internal affairs of the Irish Free State.   If this was so we should be prevented from doing anything at any time, however great the provocation might be, and however grave the consequences to the United Kingdom and the Empire.      THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR WAR observed that however carefully worded the warning might be, Mr.  de Valera would maintain that it amounted to a threat.   There v/as a very strong body of opinion, both in the United Kingdom and the Irish Free State, in favour of a warning being given as v/as now proposed.   Indeed, if no warning was given and the Oath Bill passed into law, it would be represented both here and in the Free State that a large share of responsibility for its passage must rest with the Government of the United Kingdom which had failed to bring home to those concerned the consequences of their action.    Personally, he agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that it would be unwise to take any decision at the moment on the question of further sanctions.   At the same time he impressed upon the Committee the importance of a decision being reached v/ith regard to such sanctions well in advance of the date on which the next payment of the Land Annuities falls due tobe made.
       After  some further discussion, all the LI embers of theCommittee expressed their agreement with the policy proposed,namely, that an intimation should be given by means of question and Answer in the House of Commons that theGovernment could not enter into further negotiations forfurther agreements with the Irish Free State Government, inview of the latter&apos;s contemplated repudiation of theTreatyo      The Committee then considered the question of the date on which the proposed declaration should be made.       It was pointed out that the alternatives were, either that the statement should be made in the course of thepresent week before the Bill had actually left the Dail,or that it should be postponed&quot;until after the Bill had become law.      It was agreed that if the Declaration was made afterthe Bill had reached the Senate, it would be represented asan attempt on the part of the United Kingdom Government to influence the Senate., and that for this and other  reasons the declaration should be made before the Bill actuallyleaves the Dail*      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOE FOREIGN AFFAIRS suggestedthat the Answer to the proposed Question might read somewhatas follows., and that a specific  reference to ;!butter&quot; shouldbe included in the Question:r      &quot;It is contemplated that at Ottawa the terms on       which the exemption from import duties now  granted       to the Dominions might be continued up to the       loth November will be a subject of negotiation       leading to new agreementss but His Majesty&apos;s       Government could, not remain indifferent to  the       declared intention of the Irish Government  to       disregard its present treaty obligations in the       matter of the Oath, and it would be unreasonable       to expect that His Majesty&apos;s Government should.       enter into negotiations for further agrcements                          continued preferential exemption       with a Government which contemplates the       repudiation of the agreement already entered into&quot;.
THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought  that  the  statement should he as specific as possible,  and that  the  warninggiven should be in the most  unmistakably  clear language.      The Committee agreed to  recommend the  Cabinet         (l)  That the policy of  the United  Kingdom should           be based on the view  that Mr.  de  Valera,           by securing the passage  of  the Oath Bill,           has not yet put the Irisn Free State out of           the British Commonwealth, but  that while           remaining within  the  Commonwealth, the           Irish Free State  have broken the  Treaty.       (2)  On this assumption  to adopt the policy           suggested by the  Secretary  of  State for           Dominion Affairs  in I.S.C.(32) 16, paragraph           4 (l), namely:-             &quot;to indicate that as the  Irish  Free State              have shown their intention  to  disregard              their existing engagements, it is              impossible for the United Kingdom to              enter into fresh engagements with them              or even to discuss with  them the negotia-              tion of such fresh engagements&quot;.       (3)  That this policy  should  be  announced in the           House of Commons  before  the Oath  Bill leaves           the Dailj by means  of a  Question  and Answer           to be based on the  drafts read to the           Committee by the  Chancellor of the Exchequer           and the Secretary of  State  for Foreign           Affairs.       (4)  That no decision  should  be  taken  with regard           to the question of  further  sanctions pending           the result of the above  Declaration by the           United Kingdom Government,  on  the under-           standing, however,  that  a decision v/ith           regard to the action  to  be  taken  in the event           of the withholding  in June  next of the           instalment of the Land purchase Annuities,           should be reached well in advance of the date           on which the payment  falls  due to be made.      The Committee also agreed:-       (5)  To request the Secretary of State for Dominion           Affairs to arrange  for the  preparation of the           proposed draft Question  and Answer named in           (3) above, and for  the circulation of the draft           to the Cabinet for  consideration  at the Meeting           to be held on Wednesday, May 11th, 1932.
 IMIGRANTS  PROM   2*         In  the  course  of  the  foregoing  discussion I IRISH FREE  rjE,             the  Committee were  informed, that  from  the employment                 point  of view the Ministry  of Labour were disposed to                 regard favourably any scheme to- place  special                 restrictions  on persons  coming  to this country  from the                 Irish  Free State  to seek enploymeivt  (I0S.C (52)  16 3                 page 5 (v))*  if such a scheme is  found to he practicable.                 In L-.P0A0  (32)  5  it was  stated  that  in the census of                 1921 the number of  persons  of Irish birth in England                 and  V/ales was about 55OsC0O and on a very rough  estimate                 it was possible that as  many as 150,000 persons  from the                 Free State are  now  in recexpt of  unemployment                 insurance benefit or of  transitional payment.    The                 great  majority  of these  persons are  to be found  in                 Glasgow and Liverpoole,    Irish  immigrants come  over to                 Great  Britain in large numbei4s  and many of them  seem                 become a charge On  Public Funds,                           The Committee  agreed  -                              To  invite  the Ministry of Labour  to                              furnish them  with a Memorandum dealing                              comprehensively with the whole subject                              from  the point of view of that                              Department,, JESTED DEBATES   5,         With  reference to 1,3,0,(32)  3rd Conclusions,iBOTIi HOUSES  ARLIAMENTo      the  Committee were  informed by  the Secretary of                 State  for War that  he had indicated to Lord Salisbury                 the  views of  the Commit-too  on the subject of the                 suggested Debate in the  House of  Lordso    Lord                 Salisbury had expressed  some disappointment and  had                 undertaken to inform Lord Hailaham as  to  what be and                 his  friends proposed to  do  in the matter    If  the                 Cabinet on Wednesday next approved the proposed                 Question and  Answer  it was  possible that  this                 declaration of  the  Government&apos;s policy would satisfj&apos;-

THE  HOME  SECRETARY  suggested that the TO EMPIRE -               Committee  should consider  the attitude to be adoptedUNALo in the  event  of  a proposal being made that the questions  at  issue between the United Kingdom and the Irish  Free State  Governments  should be referred to the  Empire Tribunal.           THE SECRETARY  OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS reminded the  Committee that Mr. Cosgrave had insisted on depositing the Treaty at Geneva,   It must also  be  remembered  that under the scheme approved by the  1930 Imperial  Conference for an Empire Tribunal9  it would be open to that Tribunal to consider questions such  as the interpretation of a clause  in  the Treaty  but not a question such as the breach  of  Lhe Treaty  itself.   He, Mr0  Thomas, must warn  the Committee against any proposal which might result  in  the question at issue being brought before the Hague  Court.           THE HOME SECRETARY mentioned the possibility that  some  member of the Senate might suggest a reference to  the Empire Tribunal.   He agreed that the Hague Court must be ruled out from consideration.    Public opinicn both here and in the Irish Free State would be critical of a Government  which rejected a proposal tcrefer the  matter to the Empire Tribunal.
           THE SE0R3STAKY OP STATS PGR DOMINION AFFAIRS doubted whether such a suggestion would in&apos;fact he made,  hut in the event of the Senate accepting a Motion to defer consideration of the Oath Bill pending a reference to the Empire Tribunal,  we might then acquiescea           THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR WAR said that it would  he necessary to consider very  carefully exactly what was to he referred tc the Tribunal.   A question such as the effect of the Constitutional Declaration of the  1926 Imperial Conference  on the  status of the Irish Free State  might be a fit subject for  reference, or questions of legal interpretation of a provision in the Treaty, hut the question whether the Government of the Irish  Free  State should be allowed to break  the Treaty was  not a legal question or one which could be referred to the  Tribunal.          THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that if it was seriously maintained &quot;by  anyone in the   Free State, that the  Treaty  is not mandatory as regards  the talcing of the  Oath, the United Kingdom Government  might  be wall advised to  offer at the proper  time to accept a decision of  an Empire Tribunal composed of three Judges nominated by the Dominions, provided however,  that Mt**  de  Valera  also agreed  in advance to  accept tho  decision of  the Tribunal,,          THE  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  DOMINION AFFAIRS thought that such an  offer would be of considerable value from  the point  of view of Dominion and american  public opinion.          THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL  thought  that it would he unwise  at  the present juncture to  take any stop in  the direction  of  influencing  tho  Senate inregard  to a  suggestion  of  this character9  and  that the
possibility of a reference to the :;empire tribunal should be reserved for consideration at a later date,ftT DOCUMENTSULATSD TOIRISH FREE  GOVERNMENT.5.        The Committee had before them a Note by theSecretary (l.S.C,(32) SO) relative to Foreign Officeand other secret documents circulated to the IrishFree State.          The Committee were informed that precautionary measures in the direction of withholding from the IrishFree State Government certain documents of a secretcharacter had already been taken.          The Committee took note of I.SBC. (32) 20 and agreed that for the present no action, other than thatmentioned above, need be taken with regard to restrict-ing the supply of these documents to the Irish FreeState.2,  Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.I.     9th May9  1932*
