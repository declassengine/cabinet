Memorandum hv the Secretary of State for Foreign Affaires          I  think  it necessary  to  raise for consideration &quot;by ray     colleagues  the  following matter, affecting cur relations    -with the Soviet Union.          A  question has &quot;been put  down for answer/er in the House of     Commons on May  11th (postponed  from April 27th) in the     following terms-.-          &quot;To ask  the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,       whether  his  attention has  been drawn to an article ap-       pearing  in International Press Correspondence, of 10th       March,1932,  the organ of the Communist International,       advocating armed insurrection in India;- and what action       he proposes  to  take in  view  of this violation of the       Russian  trade agreement.&quot;          I  have seen the article  to which the question refers     and  which purports to  be the  &quot;Draft platform of action of the     Young Communist League of  India&quot;.  &quot;International Press     Correspondence&quot;  is an  organ of the Communist International     issued  in various  languages in Berlin,   i am advised that     the  article may be held to constitute a breach (though     possibly not  a  very direct one) of the undertaking with re-     gard to propaganda entered into by the Soviet Government in     1929 (see annex).   This view is based on the assumption     that His Majesty&apos;s Government maintain the attitude which                                             has....
has &quot;been adopted &quot;by previous Governments in refusing torecognise that the Soviet Government can disclaim responsi-&quot;bility for the actions of the Communist International.     There appear  to be three possible courses of actionopen to us:     (a)  To protest to the Soviet Government and to receive     the certain answer that the Soviet Government have no     responsibility for the pronouncements either of the     ConTuunist Party of India or-of the Communist Inter-     national o     (b)  To protest against the publication now in question     and, in default of satisfaction, to continue pressing     our protest in this and similar cases up to the point     at which a severance of diplomatic relations may become     unavoidableo     (c)  To ignore the present and similar future pubiica-     tions.     It is useful to review very briefly the main changes in.our Prussian policy, in which this question of propaganda has so largely figured, during the past eleven years.    Trade relations between the United Kingdom and SovietRussia were first established by the Trade Agreement ofMarch, 1921, the signature to this Agreement being subjectto an undertaking against propaganda contained in the preamble.   Thereafter Pis Majesty&apos;s Government were represented in Moscow by a Commercial Agent,  and already inSeptember, 1921, Lord Curzon had occasion to proteststrongly to the Soviet Government against numerous breaches of the propaganda pledge.   These protests continued with                                          increasing 8.,
4 f15increasing strength during the immediately following years,in the course of which (May 1923) the Soviet Governmentwere obliged to agree to a more stringent form of propaganda - undertaking designed &quot;by us to include theCoramunist INTERNATIONAL onal0     In February .1924 de jure recognition was accorded tothe Soviet Government, and our Commercial Agent becameCharge d1 Affaires,   An attempt was made t6 regularise cur-relations with the Soviet by means of two treaties - generaland commercialo   In the same year the question of propa-ganda arose in an acute form.   The new conservative government which came into, power in the autumn of 1924decided not to proceed with the proposed treaty.    Theposition was therefore that the 1921 Trade Agreementremained in force, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government were represented in Moscow by a Charge d&apos;Affaires.   This con-tinued throughout 1925 and 1926, though Sir austen chamberlain had cause on more than one occasion to call attention to the continuance of anti-British propaganda,and to the fact that Fis Majesty&apos;s Government could notabsolve the Soviet Government from responsibility for theCommunist International.    In February,  1927, an even more serious warning was addressed to the Soviet Government, andin  May of the same year took place the Arcos raid;   thedenunciation by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the trade agreement of 1921;  ana the severance of  diplomatic rela-tions0     Thereafter,  British  exports to Russia including re-exports fell from over  11 million to under  5 million;   and                                             though o-,
 though  they have  since risen to  9 million, the visible balance of trade  is still  over 3 to 1 in favour of russia      In 1929 full diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union were resumed, the pledge against propaganda in the  form in .which it had appeared in the  abortive treaty of 1924 being repeated.      Mr. Henderson made verbal protests to the Soviet Ambassador on five occasions with regard to the continuance of propaganda.    The line  taken by the Ambassador was that&quot;the  Soviet Government, so.  far as they were concerned, were strictly carrying out the  undertaking entered into, but that they could accept no  responsibility for the Communist International, and had never done soa      The present  Secretary of State for India on October 5th,  1931, in reply to Questions about Communist propaganda in india said that such action as had been found possible had  been taken through the diplomatic- channel, that the attention of the  Foreign Office had been.called to cases of propaganda when they had arisen, and that questions whether any such  propaganda was a breach of the Agree- ment   &quot;the answer in his  opinion being in the affirmative&quot; should  be addressed to the Foreign Secretary.      In view of the issues involved and the probability of such questions recurring,  I feel that I cannot accept the sole responsibility for our course of action in this matter and  I request the advice of my colleagues on the three pos- sible courses of  action already indicated.,                  .(Initialled)  .
