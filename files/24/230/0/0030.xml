(THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).SECRET.                                         COPY NO.CP.  183(52).                        0 A B I N E to disarmament.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.          I attach my comments upon the enclosures to cabinet paper CP. 164(32).   It will he seen that, whilst in generalagreement with the draft &quot;Proposals for Disarmament&quot; inEnclosure I? the Admiralty have serious objections to theproposals in Enclosure II.          The covering Memorandum states that these proposals are to &quot;fee regarded as integral parts of the whole plans butI hope that this may not be necessarys as the proposals inEnclosure II raise very important practical issues in connectionwith the Naval negotiations.                       -                                       x                         (Intld. ) B.

REMARKS ON &quot;PROPOSAL FOR THE   AVIATION AND&quot; TIIE RESTRICT     1.   From the point of view of the Admiralty,,  it isconsidered that as we depend for our existence upon commodities carried in surface ships ands broadly speaking,  aircraft contribute more  toward attack upon  surface  ships  than toward their  defence., the total abolition  of naval and military aircraft would  be  advantageous  to this country3 on the understanding that International Control  of Civil Aviation would be  an essential complement of this-     2.    The suggestion that the abolition of bombing should only be put forward as  an integral part of the main proposal is regarded by the Admiralty as an undesirable limitation and it would be preferred  that should the  main proposal fail to secure general acceptance at Geneva the abolition of bombing should still be put forward as a second best alternative.     The arguments which are advanced  in paragraphs 12 to14 against the abolition of bombing (except in conjunctionwith general abolition  of Naval and Military Aircraft) are questioned upon  the following grounds:-     This  conclusion is  reached mainly on the ground that noreliance can be placed upon a belligerent adhering to theConvention when  a war is actually in progress.   It can readily be admitted that any nation which has  resorted to war in       )defiance of the  solemn undertakings entered into in recentyears will not hesitate  to break the lesser Conventions towhich it may have acceded.  The point which the Memorandumignores., howevers is that unless a nation had deliberatelymade preparations for breaking the Convention for some considerable/
 considerable time before war breaks out it will have little if any, stock of bombs, no efficient bomb-sights and no trained personnel.  In these circumstances the volume ofbomb-attack would be very much less than is possible at present and to that extent there would be a material gainupon existing conditions.     3.   I v/ould propose the following re-wording of paragraphs 18 and 19:-     &apos;*18.    For example, the aircraft carrier, one of      the most expensive types of warship, could be      dispensed with altogether and, in addition, the      abolition of military and naval aircraft might      bring, a s a direct consequence, some further relief      in connection with naval armaments.&quot;     &quot;19.    The above, taken in conjunction wi th the      proposals already suggested for the reduction in the      size of capital ships to 25,000 tons and the abolition      of submarines, which in turn should carry in their      train other reductions, for example, in coast      defences and in anti-aircraft defences and in ihb      abandonment of the use of contact mines in the open      sea, open up the prospect of a whole chain of      interconnected reduction of armaments..  Even if the      whole of these results could not be achieved,      substantial advantages would be realised, including a      considerable reduction in expenditure.&quot;     Investigation has shewn that removal of the risk of attack from the air is unlikely to permit of any appreciable reduction in the size of Capital Ships.     I am investigating further at the Admiralty the question of what would be the lowest size for the Capital Ship in the event of the most favourable issue of all other proposals forj armament reduction, but I regret that I am not at present in a position to name a figure below the 25,000 tons we have already announced.     In connection with the abolition of aircraft carriers, it must be remembered that loss of air reconnaissance may possibly result  in  the need for more cruising ships.
  REilARKS  ON  FOREIGN  OFF ICS &quot;PROPOSALS  FOR  HASTENING    THE  -(TOPIC  OF  THE  GENERAL . DISARMAMENT  CONFERENCE&quot; .          The general tone of the Memorandum appears designedto please France, In some instances at our expense, despite the fact that up to now we have made the greatest and france the least contribution toward reduction in armaments.          The main points to which the Admiralty must take exception in the proposals are as follows :-    (l)   While it is true that the London Conferenceresulted in a Naval agreement between three Powers for alimited period of 6^- years, it can scarcely be said that thelapse of two years has made noticeably easier the adhesionof the other two Powers (France and Italy) altnough theperiod for agreement is now only 4-g- years and it may be questioned whether the hopes of facilitating a quantitativeagreement by a reduction of the period are not over-estimated.  It is certainly impossible to suppose that agreement can be reached by the simple declaration of signatories as to their strength on a certain date by theprocess of &quot;eschewing all question of principle&quot;.  That isemphatically not the lesson of the London Naval Conference,nor does it appear to be the intention of this memorandum which proceeds to lay down the principle of taking theaverage of recent years as the basis.     (2)   Despite the proposed specific exclusion of theLondon Treaty Powers, the proposal that future limitationfigures should be bse ed even temporarily upon a combination of the average tonnage possessed and under construction duringthe past Y years is considered to be most objectionable. Thisis no more than a variant of similar proposals recently putforward by France and resisted by us0  We cannot afford to give any countenance to a principle which, if applied
5*i 9wifv in our own case,  would have  the most  serious  reactions. Owing to  the  fact that we  have made very drastic reductions in our fleet  and  have  not  &quot;been followed in that  policy by other countries,  which instead have been steadily expanding, a  point will  have been reached at  the  end of  1936 when so far from  our  being able to base our requirements on our average tonnage in recent  years the increases we should  re- quire in  our  own  naval strength would  be much enhanced if France were in a  position  to rely  on such a principle,,        In this connection it must not be overlooked that even under the present proposals for getting  France  and  Italy into the  London Naval  Treaty we contemplate having to &quot;escalate&quot; unless France agrees substantially to  reduce  her submarine tonnage,        (3) The proposal that a General Disarmament Conference should take place in June  or any date  in 1935 is,  in the opinion of the Admiralty,  out of the question0    The Naval Conference due to be held  in 1935  will raise  major issues of the utmost importance  and  difficulty and it is impossible to say how quickly it could be  brought to its  conclusion^   Not only might the General Conference  fixed for 1955 have to be put offp but  the  fact  of its impending so  closely might have very unfortunate  effects on  the progress  of the  Conference of Naval Powers,,        (4) It  would seem that under the proposal in paragraph 10  for  releasing  Germany from the  restrictions imposed by the Versailles Treaty, that  country would be accorded  the right to possess submarines.   Tnile  the Admiralty are in favour of Germany being released from  the Category, system of the VersaillesTreaty, it is  not   considered  that  she  should be permitted to possess submarines,
