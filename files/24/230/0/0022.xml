                   SoPROPOSED QUESTION.          To ask the Secretary of State for the Colonieswhether his attention has been drawn to the Circularrecently issued by the Maltese Bishops in connection withthe elections now pending, and what action the government proposes to take.&quot;PROPOSED ANSWER.          Yes Sir.   His Majesty&apos;s Government have givenoareful consideration to the situation arising inconsequence of the issue of the Bishops5 Circularreaffirming their Pastoral of 1930.,          In announcing the decision of the Government itis necessary that I should recall to the House thecircumstances in which the Constitution of Malta was suspended by the late Government, and the events which followed.          In May, 1930, when an election was pending in malta the Archbishop of Malta and the Bishop of Gozo issuedthe Pastoral Letter which is printed in full in command paper  3588 of 1930 (pages 80 - 83).   In that Pastoral the bishops issued directions to all Roman Catholics,instructing them how they must vote in the following terms:&quot;        &quot;And to come to the concretes and in order not to   leave in your souls any indecision.   Know, therefore,   as Catholics:-
   (I)  You may not, withou t coms&amp;itting a gr^v-e a in.,        vote for lord Strickland and his candidates I        or for ell thesev even of other parties, V*IQ        In the past, have helped and supported him        in his fight against the rights and the        discipline of the Church., or who propose to ftelp        and support him in  the coming  elections.,   \Z)  For even stronger reasons you  may nut present        yourselves as candidates in the electoral        lists proposed by lord Stride land or by ather        parties who propose tp support him in ths        coming election.   (3)  You are also solemnly bound in conscience  in        the present circumstances to take part  in the        elections and to vets for those, persons who,        by their attitude in the past,, offer greater        guarantee both for  religious welfare? and for        social welfare.        In order. then, to  prevent abuses in the   administration and reoejtion of the Sacraments, we   remind our priests that  they are striotly forbidden  to   administer the Sacrament s to the obstinate who refusf   to obey these our instructions.w          His Majesty&apos;s Government decided that thisconstituted an interference with elections which n&apos;cBritish Government could pcasibly allow and that sucha declaration in a country  like Malta, where almost everyelector is a devout Roman Catholic, mads any free electionimpossible.   His lv&apos;ajestyv  Government accordingly decidedto suspend indefinitely the election until such time as a free election could take p^ace.   The  decision which theGovernment then took was, J think, accepted in  ail quarters of the House as right, and  indeed as inevitable          In the following  year a Royal Commission wareappointed to enquire into the political  situation in Malta  and                                                        &apos;ioi!
to recommend what steps could and should be taken for its amelioration. The Royal Commission recommended that Parliamentary Government should be ? and that an election should take place in due course. But the  Mouse will  remember  that  this recommendation was baaed on  the assumption that the Pastoral of 1930 was ? and that a new  Pastoral, quite different in tone, would be issued. Upon this condition, the Royal Commission laid ? utmost stress. In their Report they use the following words :-

"That Pastoral" (i.e. the  Pastoral of 1930) "was issued in very special circumstances and is now obsolete, although it has not been withdrawn. A Pastoral has been issued before each election, and therefore it is to be presumed that a new Pastoral will be  issued before any election takes place............

"We have a belief, formed  after the most ? inquiry, that a Pastoral by the Bishops will be  quite different in tone from the  Pastoral of 1930. This belief has been one of the main considerations which have influenced us in recommending that a new election should be held.

"We cannot express too strongly our conviction upon this subject. It is founded upon long and friendly conversations with the Bishops and upon the desires expressed by Your Majesty&apos;s Government and the Holy See for good relations with one another and for peace in Malta."

The
The Government accepted the Report of the Royal Commission and, in pursuance of its main recommendation, an election is now pending in Malta. Like the Commission His Majesty&apos;s Government ? that no attempt would be made to interfere with the freedom of the Maltese electors to vote for any candidate or any party. The Archbishop of Malta and the Bishop of ?, however have now issued a Circular dated 20th May, which so far from superseding the Pastoral of 1930, in terms re-affirms that declaration and the directions it contains. In this new Circular they  write:-

"Unfortunately the situation of two years ago, from the religious point of view, has remained unchanged, certainly not through the fault of Us Bishops or of the Holy See. Therefore there is no reason why we should give to the clergy and to the people of these dioceses ? instructions regarding the exercise of the right to vote in the forthcoming political elections, as have ? already given the necessary directions by Our Pastoral  published on the 1st May, 1930".

By the issue of this Circular the Bishops have created again a situation on exactly similar to that to which their action gave rise in the last election and have once again made a free election impossible. His Majesty&apos;s Government have done their utmost to restore to the people of Malta the ? Parliamentary Government, but the essence of Parliamentary Government is that the electors shall be free to vote as they choose. ? To permit an election to take place under the
the conditions which the Bishops new seek to impose                                /\would be the negation of Psrllamentar^ GovernmentTo such an act Hie Majesty0 3 Government will &quot;be no party o   Faced with the seni 5 considerations with -;;htchour predecessors were confronted we have no alternative but tei follow the same course and to suspend theelection a   iVe do this with the utmost regret andwith the keen desire to restore to the people of malta the power to elect th sir own representativesso soon as conditions are established in whichfreedom of election is a reality0
