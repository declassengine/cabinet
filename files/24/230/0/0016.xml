Copy No.                                   CABINET.Reports by Liocal Governments on the Political  Situation in India.   I circulate for the information of my colleagues the latest weekly reports  from theLocal Governments in India.INDIA OFFICE,24th May 1932.Government of India.   The most important event of the week  has been the very grave communal riotingin Bombay.  A  separate appreciation by the Local Government is being repeated.Otherwise the week has  been very quiet, the only new feature being an attempt  to revive salt raids in two places in Bombay Presidency.    The week  has proved uneventful in  most districts, but 1,000 to 1,500 persons raided Sauikatta Salt Works, Kanara District, on 12th May, and looted 500 maunds of salt.  In  Bombay city, notwithstanding intensive propaganda, an attempted raid  on Wadala salt pans on loth May was ill-supported aud proved a complete fiasco.  The police were present in force and easily frustrated the raid.  No salt was  stolen and altogether 30  airests were made.   Congress  activities  have been suspended in the city since 16th May owing to Hindu-Muhammadan riots.  Muharram passed off peace- fully in the districts.  Ordinance 2 : Section 3, arrests,  6 ;  total under detention, 49. Section 4, orders, 18 ; total in force, 884.  Section 21, convictions during during week, 7. Special Eeport on Communal Riots in Bombay City, dated 21st May 1932.    Since  the clash on the  opening day  the  trouble has chiefly taken the  form  of isolated  murderous attacks by fugitive  gangs  with incendiarism  partially  directed against  temples or mosques, and some looting, without clashes between considerable bodies of  combatants.  There has been  no organised  rioting, but surprise attacks  ou temples,  mosques  and shops  have taken place, either  community being victimised where it is in a minority.  Casualties have been inflicted mostly in isolated encounters (many being stabbing cases), and not in the course of affrays.  Tbe gangs engaging in these attacks have dispersed rapidly on the approach of patrols, who usually find the streets empty on arrival.  Enforcement of the Curfew Order and the Order Prohibiting Assembly and the  establishment of military  and  police posts  and patrols have entirely prevented the formation of large bodies of combatants, and  looting and incendiarism have been stopped.  Bad characters  are now being combed out by the police with the assistance of the  military authorities and  placed in an emergency jail.   This will considerably reduce looting.  In the above respect,  the situation  has been under almost complete control  since 19th  May,  but sporadic outrages  cannot be prevented, and may continue for  several days.  Trouble already exists in  the  mill area, where 46  mills were  closed  on  the 19th May and  35 mills were closed  yesterday.  The Muhannnadans, being  in  a  minority, have largely evacuated the area.  Pickets and patrols in these localities  have prevented  any large clashes, and the mill operatives, encouraged by the presence of adequate forces, seem inclined to return to work.  This morning only 13 mills remain closed.  Casualties reported in the Press include persons injured on previous days who have since died  in hospital, and  therefore do not reflect on the situation from clay to day.  Excluding deaths in hospital, the number of casualties- during the whole of 19th May was 3  killed and 138 injured.  Casualties on 20th  May up  to 5 p.m. were 1 killed aud  38 injured.   Troops  and the police are  at present adequate to cope with the situation, aud the  police are now working under a propersystem of reliefs.   The Government are receiving full co-operation from the military authorities and  will immediately  ask  for any  further  reinforcements  that  may  be wanted.   It has been arranged to-day to reduce three posts from the next relief.   The-Bombay Battalion  of  the Auxiliary Force  in India, less light motor  patrol  and field     946   60  5.32S. H.Bombay.

Conditions are undoubtedly improving, and  the Bombay G-overnment have no intention of  relaxingintensive precautions until order is re-established.Delhi.
