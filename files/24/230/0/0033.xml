Circular D, Noa13.          The following message is from Acting Prime Ministerfor Prime Minister &quot;begins ;-                               *For some time His 2 ajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom havebeen preoccupied with the question of what is the &quot;best solutionof the difficult problems presented to the Disarmament Ccnfer-ence by the question of Disarmament in the air.  The UnitedKingdom Representative at Geneva formulated on the 22ndFebruary the proposal that the Disarmament Conference should undertake &quot;the practical examination of the whole problem of bombing from the air in its widest possible form&quot;c   HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have since thenreserved any expression of their views on the major issues involved as they desired to consider with an open mind the arguments in support of the various pro-posals made to the Disarmament Conference.   His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom have, however, declared their support of the principle that the Conference should pay special attention to those weapons which are most threatening to civilians.  This was incorporated in the following resolution which was adopted on the 22nd April by the General Commission &quot;in seeking to apply the principle of qualitative disarmament.... theConference is of opinion that the range of land, sea and air
armaments should he examined by the competent special Commissionswith a view to selecting those weapons whose character is the mostspecifically offensive or most efficacious against nationaldefence or most threatening to civilians&quot;.          Having regard to the immense importance of the DisarmamentConference making some definite step forward from the point of viewboth of the general international situation and particularly ofthe economic position in all countries, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom have had under their consideration the de-sirability of putting forward some far-reaching proposal of qualita-tive disarmament.   Suggestion has been made that such a proposal would best take the form of the complete abolition of all navaland military aviation.   These measures of disarmament would be accompanied by the conclusion of an International Convention to prohibit bombing from the air in war, though except as part ofthis comprehensive plan of air disarmament we do not favour thiscourse.   It appears clear that a necessary concomitant of any such proposal would be, if such could be devised, some effective formof international control of civil aviation,   Civil aircraft could otherwise be converted for use as naval and military machines onthe outbreak of war and in the absence of naval and military air-craft would dominate the situation,   Clearly this is an aspect ofthe problem in which from the point of view of the development ofair communications within the Commonwealth both the United Kingdomand the Dominions are particularly interested.          Powerful arguments can be advanced both for and against this proposal, and at present we are only engaged in considering theproblem and have not reached any conclusions whatever.    We feelthat the question is one of paramount importance to the members ofthe Commonwealth, and we are anxious to obtain at the earliest
O 9 r&quot;possible moment the reactions of Dominion Governments.Clearly if such a proposal is to be put&apos;f forward, now is themoment, and there is very little time to lose.    We think thatthe &quot;best plan therefore would &quot;be to arrange for a special meeting in London with Dominion representatives on Monday next, June 6th.   V/e very much hope that you would be able tosend a representative.   We should be very grateful In themeantime for a preliminary expression of your views both on themain problem and on the particular aspect of it relatingto the international control of civil aviation.          It will of course be appreciated that at thepresent stage the utmost secrecy is essential especially fromthe point of view of the morale of the air forces concerned.It is all-important that no hint should become known eitherhere or in foreign countries of what is in our minds.   Ends.
