This document is the &quot;&quot;property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.                           CABINET.                                                    Copy No . I,.......                   NATIONALITY OF I-TARRIED WOMEN.                Memorandum hy the Home 3 e ere tar:/.                It is now necessary to arrive at a decision on this      vexed question, as the League  of Nations has addressed a      request to its members that the Governments should furnish,      before July 1st,  1932, such observations as they desire to      present on the general question of the nationality of women,      including their views regarding the Nationality Convention      known as the Hague Convention.                When the matter was  considered by the Cabinet on      January 27th,  it was decided that the memorandum (CP.  43(32))      I had presented should be examined inter-departmentally by      the Home Office,  Foreign Office and Dominions Office, and      that I should then bring the matter again before the Cabinet.      A meeting of officials of the  three Departments was held      accordingly.                Before stating their recommendations I would remind      tne Cabinet that at a League of Nations Conference in 1930 for      the Codification of International Law it was found impossible to      obtain agreement for the adoption of the principle that women      should have the option to retain their nationality on marriage      to a foreigner.   The Conference agreed, however,  to the      principle recorded in Article  G of the Convention on Nationality,      that a woman should not lose her nationality, by reason of      marriage to a foreigner,  unless and  until by the laws of her      husband:&apos;s&apos; country she acquires her husband&apos;s nationality.      This principle has already been adopted by a, number of States      and if it were embodied in the domestic laws of all States, would                                                                   go/SECRET.CP. 162 (32)
go far towards preventing the crea,tion of statelessness insuch cases.   This proposal, however, does not affect themain question with which the women&apos;s organisations areconcerned (viz. that there should he complete equality betweenthe sexes in this matter) and is quite unacceptable to them.At the Imperial Conference in 1930, the proposals of theHague Convention were endorsed..   In January this year, theCanadian Government, refusing to wait longer for concurrentaction throughout the Empire, brought into force legislation passed last year to give effect to the Hague proposals.(Canada has a number of cases of women who have marriedUnited States citizens and thereby have lost their british nationality, without, under United States law, acquiringAmerican.)          The officials at the inter-departmehtal meetingthought that the course least open to objection was tointroduce legislation in this country to give effect to articles 8-10 of the Hague Convention on the lines of thelegislation already passed in Canada.   The meeting thoughtthat if this course were adopted the rest of the dominions would do likewise, and it was suggested that in order tosecure simultaneous legislation throughout the commonwealth the Bill for this purpose should provide that the Act shouldnot come into force until the making of an Order in Council.          With regard to other possible alternatives -(a)  The full demands of the women&apos;s organisations would not,    it was thought, be agreed to hy Canada, South Africa and    the Irish Free State, in the absence of pressure from    public opinion in those Dominions.   To bring such    pressure to bear should be the task of the women&apos;s    organisations themselves.(b)  As to the alternative that a Bill might be introduced    in two parts giving effect (i) to the women&apos;s proposals                                                      but/
     but suspending them until the Dominions have legislated     similarly, and (ii) meanwhile to enact the Hague Articles,     the meeting thought that there was a good deal to be said     in favour of this course, assuming that the present     Government, like the late Government, was in favour of     the principle of equality of the sexes.   On the other     hand, it was thought that the passing of such a measure     would subject the Government to a new form of pressure,     i.e.  pressure to bring the Act into effect notwithstanding     the absence of similar action by the Dominions.   &quot;further,     to pass a measure to which Canada, South Africa and the     Irish Free State would probably not assent would be a     dangerous precedent;  it might lead a. Dominion to pass     similar suspended, legislation on other questions of common     interest to all the members of the Commonwealth^ on which     there was lack of agreement. (c)  The  meeting was against the alternative of doing nothing,     because of the gravity of a failure on our part to carry     out an Imperial Conference re cormiendation.   In addition,     A7e have signed, though not yet ratified, the Hague     Convention.  (d) It was also against legislating in full accordance with     the women&apos;s proposals and accepting a breach in the     principle of Imperial uniformity, because of the importance     of maintaining that uniformity.          Ify own view is that the recommendation of theinter-departmental Committee is inadequate.   It is true thatthe recommendation of the Committee that legislation shouldbe passed  in this country to give effect to Article 0 of theHague Convention would enable a British-born woman to remain a British  subject on marriage to a foreigner if she does notacquire her husband&apos;s nationality.   But such cases are quite                                                exceptional/
exceptional, and this point is of comparatively slightimportance.   There would remain the substantial grievancethat the considerable number of British-born women who lose their nationality on marriage to a foreigner immediatelybecome ,aliens in the eyes of the law for.all purposes;  ifstill resident here they become subject to all the disabilitiesof an alien.   At the same time I think it importpnt not tomake any breach in the co:mmo:i citizenship of the BritishEmpire.    It is important also not to go back on our acceptance of the minor proposals ?aade at the hague conference and subsequently at the Imperial Conference.          As a possible means of meeting this situation, Ihave been examining the practicability of drafting a Billin two parts, the first giving effect to the Hague proposals,the second enabling British women not to forfeit their rights under our own domestic law by marriage to a. foreigner.Women in such circumstances would retain their rights of citizenship, and would not be treated as aliens for thepurpose  of the suffrage or for the purposes of registrationunder the Aliens A.ct.   As regards the latter, it would bepossible to secure the exemption by administrative action,but it would no doubt be more satisfactory that it should be conferred b:;r statute,  and not left to the discretion of a minister.    They would not, however, be able to claim Britishprotection if residing in their husband&apos;s country or elsewhereabroad.          Such a proposal v/ould not be likely to comnand thegeneral support of the organisations that have been pressing the question, but it might command the support of a proportionof their members.   It would not admit the full principle thata woman on marriage should have a personal right to decide whether she retains or loses her nationality, but it would go                                                         far/
May, 1932.far to remove the substantial grievance  that now exists.I suggest that,  if the Cabinet sees no prima facie  objection,this proposal should be further examined in consultationwith our legal advisers.                              HVS .
