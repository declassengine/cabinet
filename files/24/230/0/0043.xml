FOREIGN OFFICE,     S.W.1,       June 6th, 1932.       My Lord,            Monsieur de Fleurieu called this afternoon on his       return from Paris where he has spent the weekend.  I had       mentioned to him, before he left, the possibility that the       Prime Minister and I migh/t try to stop in Paris on our       way to Switzerland with a view to seeing members of the       new French Government0  Monsieur de Fleuriau said that       Monsier Kerriot would appreciate the opportunity of a       meeting before Lausanne;  his position as a Premier who       had only just been appointed made it a, delicate matter to       make the best arrangement.  He would be busy with the       French Chamber tomorrow and Wednesday, and he threw out       the hint that Monsieur Kerriot would be willing., if he       was invited, to come over to England for the purpose of       a. meeting at the end of the week r Sunday would be the       best da.y0  I thanked the Ambassador for what he had said4       and explained that I should be meeting the Prime Mini-       ster tomorrow morning when the matter would be put be-.       fore him and I should be able to give Monsieur de       Fleuriau a further indication of our view.            20  The Ambassador went on to speak of the ve-pBxa-       tions problem, and told me that in the course of an       interview with the French Ambassador at Washington on                                                    June..... Excellencyme Right,Honourable Lord Tyrrell, G.G.M.G.,etc.etco,  etc
 June  1st  last, Mr.  Stimson  declared  himself much  sur- prised  at a  statement  &quot;d&apos;un haut  oersonnage britanniaue&apos; as to the common desire of  Great  Britain  and  the  United States  to see German reprrations  entirely a.bolisheda &quot;This assertion&quot;, Mr.  Stimson declared, &quot;is not only inexact but  it is quite contrary  to  the truth.  America desires that Germany should continue to pay reparations,, Nothing would please us more or clear up  the  situation better than a loyal recognition by Germany, though only in principle, of her pecuniary Obligations..   On this point we  support the position taken  up by France&quot;0 Monsieur  de Fleuriau went on to tell me that  upon Monsieur  Claudel alluding to the  opinion  of certain Americans  that the private  creditors of Germany would obtain better security for  their  advances if  Germany re- pudiated  its political obligations,  Mr. Stimson had re- plied that this was not the view  of  his Government and added &quot;the credit of a country is a  single whole&quot; fun tout&quot;).   &quot;Germany could not repudiate its political ob- ligations  in the financial  sphere without  striking a serious blow at its private obligations and alienating the confidence of its creditors,&quot;     3*  Monsieur de Fleuriau told me that he had seenKerr von Neurath today and, as I understood him, had recounted to him what he had just told me a,s having beenreported to the French Government by its Ambassador atWashington?  My comment was that what we must all  aim atwas agreement as regards the future of reparations asdistinguished from repudiations   The practical questiontherefore was to discover what arrangement might be made
                                             3oto which Germany would agree0  The Ambassador expressed his own view that no Frenchman would agree to purecancellation.  Monsieur Herriot, bethought, attached great importance to finding some formula which would in-volve a recognition by Germany of her obligation, eventhough it in fact worked out as a termination of payment and he referred to schemes which have been suggested fora postponed contingent obligation charged on German rail-ways and resulting in payment only if a certain level of prosperity was hereafter perched.  I said that we were of course familiar with these suggestions of compromise, -but here again it seemed to me that the critical question was whether such proposals could receive German assentoIf they did not, even the making of them would not pre-vent repudiation.  Therefore v/e must work together toreach some plan to which Germany as well as Prance and Britain could assent.  The Ambassador told me that inhis conversation with Herr von Neurath today the latter had emphasised the need of peaching what he calledgeneral appeasement.  I asked whether the German ForeignMinister had explained to Ports!eur de Fleurisu what hehad in mind, end the letter said he had not.  So I men-tioned, as a possible factor to be considered,  the ideaof a political truce to be entered into for a period ofyears during which all the parties to it undertook to pursue no policy in external affairs which would pro-voke controversy with their neighbours.   Monsieur deFleurisu had received the seme impression as I from theGerman Foreign Minister,  viz*  that he intended to pre-
                                            4osent the German case for Lausanne in moderate termsrather than to present an. ultimatums  I ascertained that herr von Neurath had net given to Monsieur de Pleuria.ua. copy of the aide memo ire which he handed to me thismorning, and I made no allusion to its contents,                I have, etc.                   (Signed)  JOHN SIMON.
