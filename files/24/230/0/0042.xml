(Sent 11-30 P.M.  1st June,  1932.)    IMPORTANT.  Most Secret.  Circular D, No. 13.    The   following  message  is  from  Acting  Prime  Minister  for   PrimeMinister:                                                           i fjd    Begins: Por some time His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom have been preoccupied with the question of what is the best solution of the difficult,problems  presented  to  the  Disarmament   Conference by   the  question  of disarmament  in  the air.   The  United Kingdom Representative at  Geneva.formulated on the 22nd Februarj&apos;- the proposal that the Disarmament conference should undertake &quot; the practical examination of the whole problem of bombingfrom the air in its widest possible form.&quot;   His  Majesty&apos;s Government  in theUnited Kingdom have since then reserved any expression of their  views on, the.major  issues involved,  as they desired to  consider with an open mirid the&apos;arguments in support of the various proposals  made to  the  Disarmament1Conference. His Majesty&apos;s  Government in the United Kingdom have, however,declared  their support of the principle  that  the Conference should pay special attention to those  weapons which are most threatening to civilians.   This wasincorporated in the following resolution, which was adopted on the 22nd Aprilby the General Commission : &quot;In seeking to apply the principle of qualitativedisarmament .... the Conference  is of opinion that the range of land, sea-and(Signed)M.

(ieien.ce,inmost... threatening, to civilians.&quot;     Having regard to the immense importance of the Disarmament Conferencemaking some definite step forward from the point of view both of the general international situation and particularly of the economic position in all countries,His  Majesty&apos;s  Government in  the United  Kingdom  have  had under  their-consideration the desirability of putting forward some far-reaching proposal ofqualitative disarmament.  Suggestion has been made that such a proposal would best take the form of the complete abolition  of all naval and  military aviation.These measures of disarmament would be accompanied  by the conclusion of anInternational Convention to prohibit bombing from the air in war, though, except as part of this comprehensive plan of air  disarmament, we do not favour thiscourse.  It appears clear that a necessary concomitant of any such proposal wouldbe, if such could be devised, some effective form of international control of civilaviation.  Civil aircraft  could  otherwise  be converted for use  as naval andmilitary machines on the outbreak of war and  in the absence of naval and military aircraft  would  dominate  the  situation.   Clearly  this  is  an  aspect  of theproblem  in  which,  from  the  point of  view   of  the  development  of air communications within  the  Commonwealth, both the United Kingdom and theDominions are particularly interested.  &apos; &apos;  Powerful  arguments  can be advanced both for and against  this  proposal,and at present we are only engaged in considering the problem, and have not reached any conclusions whatever.  We feel that the question is one of paramount importance to the members of the  Commonwealth, and we are anxious to obtainat the earliest possible moment the reactions of Dominion Governments.   Clearlyif such a proposal is to be put forward,  now is the  moment, and there is very little time to lose.  We think that the best plan, therefore, would be to arrange for aspecial meeting in London with  Dominion representatives  on Monday next,6th  June.  We  very much hope that you would be able to send a representative.We  should be very grateful in the meantime for a  preliminary expression of your views both on the main problem and on the  particular aspect of it relating to tiieinternational control of civil aviation.     It wall, of course,  be appreciated that  at  the  present  stage  the  utmostsecrecy is essential, especially from the point of view of the  morale of the airforces concerned.   It is all-important  that no hint should become known eitherhere or in foreign countries of what is in our minds.  Ends.

They presume  that  such abolition would not preclude the maintenance of a very small force,  say, one squadron, for internalpolice  purposes only, in a country like the Union, of such  great distances andsparse communications. :( JHis Majesty&apos;s  Government in the Union realise that some form of control ofcivil aviation  as suggested  is an essential corollary to proposal, but they  would appreciate, before expressing an opinion thereon, fuller indication of lines upon                     ..........____________......;.-X.x..U.()...247.(.:i2^.......................;

Most Secret.  No. 75.   Following for Acting Prime Minister ;:     Begins: Air Disarmament.  Your  telegram of 2nd June, Circular, $(-13,*Secret.   His Majesty&apos;s  Government in Canada recognise that, With the approach of the Lausanne Conference, the relation of which to disarmament is fully appre-ciated,  it  is especially desirable to do  something  to transform  into definiteachievements the somewhat, ineffective  Geneva discussions of  last  four months.We  therefore, in principle, heartily support any effort towards this end.   As tothe-particular proposal  in your telegram, the total abolition of naval and militaryaviation, we see great  merit in such objective, but we cannot, without further details,  express  a definite opinion as to  its practicability.   As your telegramindicates, such abolition must clearly depend on some satisfactory solution of theproblem of international control of  civil aviation.   It was  obvious  in. thediscussions at Geneva that the French proposals for internationalisation were, notfeasible; nor have we as yet been able to visualise a practicable solution consistent with the view which Canada holds in common with all the other  Members of theBritish  Commonwealth, and which was re-stated in Sir George Perley&apos;s openingaddress at the Disarmament Conference,  namely, that the League should not be developed  as a super-state.   But  if  His  Majesty&apos;s Government  in  United!Kingdom are able to devise a plan which is likely to secure general acceptanceand  which would meet  the difficulties indicated, His Majesty&apos;s  Government inCanada will give the question the further and immediate consideration indicativeof the importance deserved and will be ready to support measures  of disarmamentin every field which are found feasible and effective.   We should  be obliged ifcopies of your telegram and this reply could be  furnished immediately to the HighCommissioner, whom we have asked to attend  meeting on 6th June.       ,, s,..tVys                               * No. D.O. -247 (32).

Dated 5th June, 1932.                     (Received 9-15 A.M.  5th June,  1932.)    MOST Secret.  No. 40, 5th June.    Your Most Secret telegram,  Circular  D  13,  1st  June.*   DisarmamentConference.   Following from Prime Minister for Acting Prime Minister :     Begins : Request has been sent to High Commissioner  for New Zealand inLondon to arrange to represent this Dominion at the Conference to be held onMonday, the 6th June, in London.  His Majesty&apos;s Government in New Zealandappreciate fully the fact  that the facilities necessary for the expression of aninformed opinion  on the  proposal which  is now being considered are,  at  thisdistance, largely lacking  and they will be  prepared to  support any  policy inregard to disarmament that meets with the  approval of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom.                                       ,    They feel at the same time constrained to observe that the questions involved are riot only  intricate in themselves, but possibly of vital importance to the BritishCommonwealth of Nations, and on this occasion, as on  several past occasions.they  question most  earnestly whether  the decision of  such matters without adequate opportunity for close and careful study and at very short notice caube,in the best interests of the British Commonwealth.    His Majesty&apos;s Government in New Zealand have seen no reason, in their consideration of the policy to be adopted by them  at the Disarmament Conference,to dissent from paragraph  106 of Secret  Document R.A.1,  16, and  they wouldbe inclined to the view that, at the present stage of development of civil aviation,when  its progress  and indeed its continuance are dependent almost universallyupon heavy subsidies, any international control could scarcely be practicable andwould probably be inimical to British interests.    His Majesty&apos;s Government  in New Zealand have observed that, except aspart of a comprehensive plan of air disarmament, His Majesty&apos;s  Government inthe United Kingdom would not be prepared to support complete prohibition of bombardment  from the air in time of  war.  They appreciate  difficulties thatwould no doubt be met in securing a general acceptance  of this principle,  andthat the principle would be dangerous unless adopted universally and applieduniversally,  but this is an objection which would seem to  be  applicable  generally to most of the proposals which are before  the Disarmament  Conference, and theabolition of  bombardment  from the air would seem to be  at  least  as appropriate to the purpose of the proposed Disarmament Convention as the  clause to whichthe Preparatory Commission agreed, which provides for the prohibition of theuse of gas.   The  New Zealand Government would have been disposed to theview,  that an  effective prohibition of bombardment from the air would prove to be  not only a  humanitarian measure  of the utmost  value,  but also to be calculated to be of  even  more direct benefit  to the United Kingdom than toany; Other Power,  and that such a proposal, if its  general adoption  appearedto be  feasible, might well be supported, irrespective of any other measure(s) ofair disarmament,  by all Governments of the British Commonwealth of Nations.Ends.&apos;   -io\\&apos;.r\                        * No. D.O. 247 (32).  -f &quot;                            (VI.)NoF )&apos;p. 258  (32).Paraphrase Telegram from  the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to the   - .r, ;,     Minister of External Affairs,  Union of South Africa.   &apos;il *&apos;&quot;*&apos;&quot;                (Sent 3 F.M.  4th June, 1932.)
