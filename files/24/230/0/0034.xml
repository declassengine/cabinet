*j r) ryTHIS DOCUMENT 13 TIB PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; 3 GOVERNMENT.SECRET .                                        Copy Ho. . . . Irf.&quot;*                        CABINET.C. &apos;?.1B6(3S)            Adminiatration of Transitional Payments.              Memorandum by the Minister of Labour, 1,    In C?.64(52)  I drew attention to some areas where the requirements  of the law regarding transitional payments were being so  flagrantly disregarded that I might be compelled to  take the duty out  of  the hands cf the  local Authority and appoint persons to  perform it in their stead,  as I am empowered to do by the Order  in  Council.    I explained, the policy that I was pursuing. I was not  insisting upon a strict application of the Poor Law to applicants for transitional payments,  but I was requiring that proper  account should be taken of the  resources of the  household cf  which  the  applicant was a  member:   I only contemplated supersession  when all other efforts to obtain a reasonable compliance with  the  law had failed.   I have no  power under  the Order to  surcharge  an Authority which, despite  admonition, continue isly  disobeys the law,  and the only protection  for  the Exchequer which  is paying the  whole cost  is  that  if necessary an  Authority  which wilfully disregards its  responsibility as Trustee for the  expenditure of  the  Exchequer  money, should be superseded.     This policy was  approved by  my colleagues  in  Cabt.16(32)8. 2.   &quot;.*ith the help of  the Inspectors of the Ministry of Health several of the areas referred  to  have been  induced to adopt a.better administration.  This has  reduced the discrepancies in the treatment of applicants between one area and another, and so  is removing a cause for complaint.  Other areas are under further examination, and in one or  two of them I may ultimatelyhave to move,   I have now come to the conclusion that in fairness to  other and more loyal Authorities, and as a protection for the
0 0? H U Exchequer, I must use my powers and appoint a person or persons to administer the  scheme in the area of the County Borough of Rotherham. 3.    Rotherham began very badly,  and an unsatisfactory  report was received by the end of November.   In January the Divisional Controller of the Ministry made strong personal representations to the Mayor,  but without effect.  At the end of  January the General Inspector  of the Ministry of  Health had to  make another unsatisfactory report,  and early in February  he met the Public Assistance Committee,  who promised to  improve their administration.   On  the 12th March  the General Inspector had to report that  he could find no evidence of  any  real improvement.      On the 22nd March,  following upon this Report,  I caused a strongly worded letter tc be sent to the  Authority, informing them that, unless they  complied with the law  I should  have to consider  superseding them.   Representatives of the Public Assistance  Committee were  subsequently  seen  at the Ministry,  and the type  of  determination to  which we  took exception was clearly  indicated to  themu    The  deputation made little  attempt to defend the decisions  given  -  indeed they could not  - but  promised repentance.  The Authority did in fact  revise some of  their  worst decisions,  though not all,but at  a meeting on  10th May they gave  a  series of equallybad decisions.,      The Authority  cannot  complain, therefore,  that they havehad no warning,  or  that  I have unduly rushed  them in a difficult tasko4o    The whole of  the work  in Rotherham is badly donee   the records are incomplete, the earnings of members of the house-hold  are not  c?.lways verified, although in several casesverification has  shown that they were  seriously understated.
                                                           (o H D But the offences are not technical:   the  determinations that have been given are not such that any Public Assistance Authority in the country would publicly defend them.    In particular,  transitional payments at  the  full rate or  a little less are  being  given to applicants who are  members of  a house- hold with quite substantial  incomes coming  in in the form of wages.  If a needs  test is  to have any meaning this cannot be permitted. 5.   I  give  the following examples, which are only a sample out  of  many:-     (e)  Single man,  aged 21,  family  5, income from wages           5-ll.lOd.   Pull rate 15/3d  granted.     (b)  Man and wife,   300  in &quot;war Loan,  and 534 in Co-Operative          Society.   Decision  20/-,  the maximum being 23/od.          (For several weeks  the maximum was paid).     (c)  Man and wife.   Income from adult children  4.16. 8d.          for four j^persons.   Decision  20/- - full rate  23/3d.     (d)  Family of  10 with wages  of  10.16.6d.   Applicant          (father) given 10/-r     (e)  Single girl  21, family 5, income of  5,. 1. 5d.          Determination  8/-.     (f)  Single man 233  family 5,  wages stated  5,  on  verifica-          tion  6.   Determination  10/3d.     (g)  Single man aged 20,  family 5,  income  5-3.7d.   10/-          given. 6.   To acquiesce in such decisions would be grossly unfair both to the  Authorities and  the applicants  in areas like Leeds, Newcastle,, Biri&apos;aingham,Lancashire,  London, and indeed in  almost all  the County  Boroughs  and  most  of the counties.   What Rotherham is doing  ia known,  and  unless it  is  stopped  we shallbe held to  approve  of it. 7.   Rotherham  have not  the  excuse that their unemployment is quite exceptional.    Unemployment there is hoavy,  though there is a good deal  of irregular working with  reasonably high earnings in the pits.  Such towns ns Barnsley and  Sheffield, where theAuthority is by no means strict, rather the reverse, have comparable unemployment, but their results are quite different.
9 Q A     The extent to which Rotherham allows the full scale of payment to almost everyone,  thus making the needs test practical!inoperative,  is plainly brought out in the following table:-Period 21st March	- 2nd	April, 1932.				Pull Allowance . of	Partial Allowance %	No Allowance %Rotherham		98.2	1. 2	0.6Sheffield		70.8	25.8	3.4Barns!ey		75.8	12.1	12.north Eastern Divi	si on	67.2	23. 6	9.2Great Britain		53o8	31.2	15.08.   Indeed of all the areas in  the  country Rotherham are atpresent showing probably the worst administration, despitewarnings and advice, and their representatives are publiclytaking credit for what they are  doing.  Unless I deal with them,I cannot hope to bring other recalcitrant Authorities into line,nor can I expect other Authorities to resist the temptation to relax their administration when  laxity at the expense of theExchequer appears to bring no unpleasant consequences.   Much ofthe complaint of the needs test  administration is due tocomparison between the actions of law-abiding Authorities anddisobedient Authorities.   For several reasons I regard Rotherhamas a test case that the Government intends to have a reasonablecompliance with the lav/ on the matter?9.    I  ask the concurrence,  therefore,  of the Cabinet in the  .action  I  propose.                                      (Intld. )  H. 3.10th June,  1032
