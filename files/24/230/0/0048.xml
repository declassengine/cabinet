STATISTICS OF FOREIGN TRADE AND  VOLUME OF RETAIL  SALES                               IN RECENT MONTHS.              Note by the President of the Board of Trade..         1. With reference to the Memorandum CP. 137(32) circulated by      the Minister of Labour, there are certain considerations to  which      I think it well that the attention of my Colleagues should be      called.   These relate to the references in the Minister of      Labour&apos;s memorandum to the statistics of our Foreign  Trade and      to the volume of retail sales in recent months.         2. It is quite true that the value of our foreign  trade has      fallen substantially in the current  year, there being a decrease      in the value of the net imports of 12 per cent,  and a decrease in      the value of our domestic exports of 7 per cent in the first      four months of this year as compared with the corresponding      period of 1931.   But, especially when we are attempting to  maice      comparisons with foreign countries whose currencies are on a      different basis from ours, it is important to eliminate price      changes.   This is done quarterly in the &quot;Board of Trade      Journal&quot; and the most  recent investigation shows that the volume      of imports in the first quarter of this year after making      allowance for price changes was as nearly as possible the same      as in  the first quarter of last year, that the volume of our      domestic exports as a whole was less than a year ago by no more      than one per cent and  that the volume of re-exports was about      6 per  cent greater.   Taking manufactured articles only it      appears that the volume of such manufactured articles exported      was  actually greater  in the first quarter of this year than in      any  quarter of last year.
   3.  &quot;Whilst no corresponding calculation is  available  inregard to the volume of trade in April it may  he noted thatin that month the value of the exports of United kingdom goods was higher than in any month since January, 1931*The increase was mainly in manufactured articles,  &quot;butexports of coal were also somewhat greater both in value andin quantity than a year ago.  As compared with the previous month exports in April were greater by 696,000 tons, exportsto Italy increased by 277,000 tons, exports to Canada by140,000 tons, and to the Irish Free State by 50,000 tons.-  Theremainder of the increase is spread over a large number  of countries   4o  The figures given in the memorandum, showing the declinein the trade of certain foreign countries stand in need  ofsome correction..  The following statement is based on theofficial trade returns of the cotmtrie s concerned.       Percentage decline (by values) in January to April,1932,            compared with January to April- 1931*                                        Imports.        Exports,.            United States .......         30               36            France ...............         35               58            Germany.............         36               36 2              H including reparationsr      If price changes be allowed for it appears that thevolume of imports into the United States for the first quarter of this year was 4 per cent below that of the first quarter of 1931, while the volume of  exports decreased byabout 16 per cent.  For Germany the decline in the volumeof imports v/as 13 per cent and of exports was 24 per cent forthe  first four months of the year.  No  corresponding figures are  available for France.
         15.  In paragraph 10 of the Memorandum reference is made to      the index of retail sales showing for the months February to      April a fall of 4.3 per cent, compared with the same months      last year.  It is, however, to be observed that this fall      relates to the value of retail sales not the volume, and it is      by no means certain that the volume of sales declined as the      fall in the price of the goods sold by retail may well have      been as much or even greater than the fall of 4.5 per cent, in      the value of the sales.  Employment figures are furnished by      the departmental stores and a number of multiple stores, but      these figures do not include the co-operative societies whose      sales are included in the retail trade figures.  So far as the      employment figures go, they do not indicate any substantial      decrease in employment in the retail distributive trade as      compared with the corresponding month of last year.  In      February there was a slight increase in numbers employed;  in      March and April a decrease, but one amounting to 0.6 per cent.      only.                                                      V.R.Board of Trade,      9th June, 1933.
