MEMORANDUM BY  THE  SECRETARY  OF STATE  FOR WAR.    I circulate for the information of my colleagues a memorandum by the Chief of the   0160Imperial General Staff on the technical aspects ol the proposals contained in the three   1701Disarmament  Papers issued  on Friday  last (CP.  164  (32)).  The Cabinet will appreciate that this note necessarily consists of first impressions ; but I think that mycolleagues will find it of material assistance in  their consideration of the proposals.MEMORANDUM BY  THE  CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL  GENERAL STAFF.    In submitting my remarks on the Memorandum dealing with the proposal for theabolition of naval and military aviation  and the restriction of civil aviation, togetherwith the Foreign Office  Memorandum reviewing the present state and  prospects of theDisarmament Conference, I propose  to offer only such comments on the memorandum as a whole as seem to me to bear directly on the military aspect and on the reactions to military policy which would inevitably ensue.    I propose to deal with the Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council first and then to consider the suggestions set forth for initiating a more helpful programme for the Disarmament Conference.    1. The object  of the Memorandum by  the  Lord  President  of the Council  isclearly set forth  in its third paragraph          &quot; The  general conclusion  to which  His Majesty&apos;s Government  has come  is    that, so far  as disarmament in the air is concerned, nothing short of measures of    the  widest  scope will suffice.   They therefore  propose to the  Disarmament     Conference  the  abolition of all military and naval aircraft, combined with a strict    international control of civil aviation.  ...&quot;    His  Majesty&apos;s   Government  further  suggests that  these  measures  of  dis-armament should  be accompanied  by the conclusion  of a National Convention to prohibit bombing from the air as a method of warfare.     It seems desirable first of all to  set down  the general results of the proposal, asthey appear to me when considering its practical application.  If the abolition of navaland  military  aviation were ever to become a  practical fact, it must apply with equalforce  to every  nation represented  at the Disarmament  Conference.   The net result would therefore be  that the clock would be  put  back some  20 years ; in  fact, weshould  automatically revert to the military situation that existed allowing for theTreaty results of the Great War in 1912.  A unilateral application of the pi*proposal  is out of the question.   From the  broadest view  of national  defence, an effective total abolition  of all  naval and military  aircraft  throughout the  world cannot but be advantageous  to this country,  as tending to  restore to  us the sea as our first line ofdefence, and as removing the danger  of air attack  on London.  Total  abolition  will     (B32/8) 70  5/32  W.O.P. 6203H.THE WAR  OFFICE,30th May, 1932.
make a difference  in  the spheres of responsibility  entrusted to the  Army, and inpotential  additional commitments balanced  possibly to a  certain extent by a release from present air liabilities.  Subject  to  these  general  observations I offer my remarkson the military implications contained in the proposals.     2.  One of the  main effects of the abolition of military aircraft will  be the fact thatthe view of &quot; the other side of the hill&apos;: will  be denied to us.  In the  main I considerthat the deprivation of Air Forces working directly and in close co-operation with theArmy in the Field  will be one of the chief drawbacks from a military point of view tothe  suggested abolition.  The co-operation  of reconnaissance and spotting aircraftworking with an army in the field has been developed to a high pitch, and it will be essential to provide ground forces either mechanized or cavalry to take on the dutyof strategical reconnaissance, which has since its inception been the special role  of theAir Force.     In 1914 we had 28 regiments of Cavalry of the Line, which have been reduced by1932 to 20 regiments, due to a large extent to the introduction of the Air Force.   It is reasonable to presume  that the abolition of the latter might necessitate an  increase ofthe Cavalry or its mechanized equivalent up to at least  its pre-war total.  I allow thatthis is not a very strong argument as applied to the British Army.     3.  The role of aircraft in coast  defence has also been one of co-operation ; indeed,its importance in this  particular  aspect  of  co-operation has  been emphasised only sorecently as last week in the publication of the report of the Ministerial Committee onCoast Defence.   The abolition of aircraft would in so far as coast defence is concernedmake little difference, as it would apply equally both to the defender and  the attacker.It is true  that on those occasions when it might be essential for guns  to  have aircraftavailable for spotting, the  latter would not be available ; yet it is equally true that thebombarding ships would not be able to rely on aircraft for their observation,  and  wouldin consequence have to  stand-in  to the  shore  close enough to distinguish the targetswhich it was desired to engage.   This manoeuvre naturally would enable the defendersalso  to  identify and engage  the  attackers.  Therefore what  may be essential to-daybecomes non-essential if aircraft are totally abolished.     4.  The  abolition of  aircraft for all  military purposes, combined with a  strictinternational control of civil aviation, would presumably free us from the responsibilityfor  maintaining anti-aircraft defences  both  at our ports  and more especially  as an integral portion  of  the air defences of Great Britain.   The regular anti-aircraft artillerybrigades now in existence are two in number ;  but the  organization for the air defenceof Great  Britain, which is partly military and partly air,  envisages the  employmenteventually of no less  than 24  batteries of anti-aircraft artillery and  31 anti-aircraftsearchlight  companies.   Our release from the necessity for  maintaining what is inexistence  and legislating for the  financial provision  of  that which  is  still furtherintended  would  undoubtedly be of considerable advantage.   This is a very strong pointin favour  of abolition.     5.  The effect of the total abolition  of military aircraft on the countries for whichthe Air Ministry is responsible or in which air forces are stationed, and  in which theresponsibility of maintaining order would  naturally devolve on the  Army, either as aBritish  commitment or as the sole remaining defensive force, is set out below.  I would emphasise that these remarks are my first impressions.     Egypt. The role of the forces in Egypt being mainly concerned with internal security duties, they would not be affected  to any appreciable extent by the withdrawalof such air forces  as  are stationed  there.   In my opinion, the garrison  would not require  any increase on this account.     Sudan. The  removal of the Royal Air Force squadron now in the Sudan  would undoubtedly affect  ability  to carry out  strategic  reconnaissance, and would make the location of hostile  bodies  both  more difficult  and  slower.   This might necessitate anincrease in the  garrison either  of  local troops or the addition  of a  further British battalion.   The  actual internal security would, as in the case of Egypt, be little affected.     Palestine. The two battalions of Infantry now in Palestine,  which were sent thereafter the disturbances in  1929, would  be sufficient to maintain order in that countryirrespective of whether  the Air  Force  were  in existence  or  not.   This commitmentwould,  however, become a definite additional commitment of the British Army insteadof, as at present, a  temporary one and would necessitate an increase of two battalions inthe total British establishment.   Palestine  being at present a responsibility of the RoyalAir Force would become a military responsibility.
ISO     1 rans-J ordania. The work done  by the  Royal Air  Force is solely  defensivereconnaissance.  The replacement of this  aircraft by a company of military armoured cars with a possible increase of a company  in  the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force wouldbe sufficient.     Aden. The squadron of  the Royal Air Force which is now stationed in Aden the defence of which port is  a Royal  Air  Force responsibility would need to bereplaced by its pre-war garrison of infantry.   Further, it  is  possible  that there mightbe an increase of  Zedei activity on the Yemen border if the threat  of  bombing  were removed,   The loyal tribes  in  the  hinterland,  however, could, in  my opinion, be supported effectively by local levies.     The guns for the seaward  defence of Aden have remained in situ, and form part ofthe defence scheme devised for the port  under Royal  Air Force control.   There will,therefore, be no alteration in regard to them other than the general modernization whichis to be carried out on a programme throughout all  the coast defences.     Iraq.   Under the terms of the Treaty of 1930, six squadrons  of the Royal AirForce  are  retained   in  Iraq  to guard  &quot; vital  imperial  communications.&quot;   This is undoubtedly a matter which demands consideration.  With the abolition of the militaryand naval air forces, the communications for consideration will be solely those used bycivilian aircraft.   The internationalization  of the  latter, and  the uncertainty as to theexistence or otherwise under the new scheme of  the  various companies now  existingmake it impossible to say to what extent we should require to remain in Iraq.  At thesame time, I am strongly against i^eplacing the Royal Air Force  squadrons in question by land forces, as the difficulty of providing the latter with any line of communicationwould be very great.     Persian  Gulf. The  situation  would  be unaffected.   At the moment we have notroops in  the  Persian Gulf and, such as we had (one battalion)  before the Great  War,were practically entirely to prevent gun running and to preserve order on the Littoral.The question  of the  defence of the  Persian  Oilfields  does  not arise  in peace and, if it did,  we have uo facilities for quartering any forces on the  Persian Gulf.     India. The militar-y forces in India  have  not been substantially altered by theintroduction of Air Forces.   The removal of what is undoubtedly a valuable additionalarm  would, as far as the North-West Frontier is concerned, in  my  opinion, force theGovernment  of  India  to implement their  declared policy  of occupation  up to theDurand  line.   As  long  as  Air Forces are  retained in India  so  long are they acomparatively  cheap method of avoiding the  necessity for carrying out that policy.  Inregard to external aggression, we should undoubtedly  suffer a disadvantage by theabolition of military air forces  in that we  should lose a weapon  not possessed by our opponents, and this absence might  delay a  decision, but I am very definitely of theopinion that the possible disadvantage to  the Indian  Frontier which would ensue bythe withdrawal of aircraft should not  be allowed to affect the decision in  regard to total abolition.     6. I wish to qualify the remarks I  have made under the various countries in thepreceding paragraph  by making it clear  that I  recognize that the  removal of heavytransport  squadrons would  make  rapid  reinforcement of disaffected  centres  moredifficult,  but  at the  same time, where good  local intelligence exists, the  necessity forsuch rapid reinforcement  should not  occur frequently.  Nevertheless, the abolition ofmilitary aircraft and  the  disappearance  in a large  measure of the Imperial  coramuni-cations will undoubtedly necessitate  the stationing of British troops throughout theEmpire in larger numbers and  at more stations than they now are.   Up to the presenttime we have reduced our battalions  of Infantry of the Line from  148 in 1914 to 126in 1932 ; whilst the Indian Army  battalions have been  reduced from  141 to   107.The reduction in  the British  regiments  has to a large extent been effected by thewithdrawal of overseas garrisons.  I  consider that the situation caused by the abolitionof military air forces would necessitate an increase in these overseas garrisons, whichin itself, would necessitate an  increase in  the establishment of  infantry for  Imperialdefence.     7. To sum  up, I am  of  opinion that the abolition  of the military  air  force would necessitate an increase of the  infantry of the British  Army, and possibly of the cavalry ; would not affect the artillery j would enable the anti-aircraft organization, botlifor the defence of Great Britain and of all  overseas  fortresses and also in the field,  to be     (6203)
abolished ; and  would not otherwise hiive any military implications, either by way ofan increase in establishments .or a great addition of responsibility.     8.  The second paper reviews the present state and prospects of the DisarmamentConference, and draws the conclusion that the objectives in every field have been  tooambitious, with  the  result that too much stress has been laid on  all possible futurecontingencies, resulting in the submission of high figures and mutual suspicion of suchwhen published.  It is  suggested that the  better method is to eschew all question ofprinciple, and  all attempt to lay down any lasting relationship of strength.     The proposals are, briefly, that we should simply declare that, on  a  certain dated few years&apos; hence, the armament which each signatory will possess  will not  exceed X.The date suggested, tentatively,  is 31st December,   1936.   The figure &quot;X&quot;  to  beinserted must  not be higher than  the average budget figures of the last &quot; Y &quot;  years,expressed in terms of men and material.  It  is suggested that the guiding figures couldbe the total effectives with the Colours and the budgetary expenditure on materials.     9.  If such a declaration be  made in the  form  of a  *&apos; Gentleman&apos;s  agreement&quot;without any definitions and figures other than the proviso that the level &quot; X  &quot; will  notbe exceeded, it is  perhaps feasible to imagine that a  breathing space will be granteduntil the next Disarmament Conference in 1935,  by which time the hope  is  expressed that economic conditions may have exercised a moderating influence.  But it is an unfortunate  fact that  it is  precisely  on  this  question   of  limiting  effectives  andexpenditure that most  of the  technical  discussions  in connection with  quantitativedisarmament  have turned, and we are  faced with  the difficulty that, without  precisedefinitions and figui&quot;es, the agreement is  of  doubtful  value  (for I am convinced thatsuch a general agreement could not be supervised at all effectively by any internationaldisarmament commission such  as  is proposed in  the  draft Disarmament Convention),whilst if definitions  and figures are to be inserted, we are faced with a discussion of details,  which is both  highly technical  and controversial.  The sub-commission atGeneva  is at the moment actually involved  in the intricacies of this question of whatconstitutes &quot; Effectives.&quot;     10.  To turn for a moment to  details  in  connection with land armament, it is by no means clear what it is intended to  convey  by the proposal that :          &quot; In the case  of land  armament,  the  guiding  figures could  be  the total    effectives  with the Colours and budgetary expenditure on material.&quot;     This would appear to mean that the figure limits would be expressed :--     (a)  For  effectives,  in terms  of  &quot; effectives  budgetaires,&quot; (or,  in our own case,           &quot; Vote A&quot;) with  its  widely different interpretations  according  to  the           practice in different countries.     (i)  For materials, in terms of budget expenditure thereon.     So  far as  effectives are concerned, a limit on the effectives with the Colours wouldignore our own  Territorial Army, and  the whole of the trained  reserves of  conscriptarmies.   Further, under such  an agreement, it  would be possible to  call reservists tothe Colours and to give them 6 months or more  training  in the year without contra-vening the agreement.     The Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference spent a good dealof time in considering how personnel  could  be expressed in figures for limitation andcomparative purposes.  The final  solution was a formula  with the  object of limiting,not the  number of &quot; live  men &quot;, but the number of &quot; men-days&apos; duty &quot;  performed.     Short of  applying qualitative disarmament in the realm of personnel to  all  States(as it was applied  to Germany by allowing her  only  a regular  army of  long-service personnel, and no other military training), the evolution  of  a formula to express the size of the trained  j)ersonnel of  the different States raises many technical difficulties ;for instance, the &quot; men-day-duty &quot; formula evolved by the  Preparatory Commission is admittedly imperfect for comparative  purposes  between conscript  short  service  and voluntary long service  armies.   No  solution has, however, yet been  found  to  thefollowing questions, which are at this moment engaging the attention of&apos;the Commissionon Effectives now sitting at Geneva and raising heated discussion :      (a) flow are the following defined :                                 Effective ?                                Day&apos;s duty ?                                Officer ?                                Preliminary training ?
     (b) Are the cadets  of the  Military Colleges,  Naval Colleges,  Officers Training            Corps, and so forth, to be included in the numbers subject to limitation ?     (c) How  is &quot; Preliminary  Training&quot;   to  be  distinguished  from  &quot; Military            Training&quot; ?and other questions of  a  similar  nature which do not  seem to  dimmish  as  thediscussion proceeds.     11. In the  consideration  of  the  limitation in expenditure on material, the same order of technical difficulty has to be faced.  This particular phase of the enquiry was examined most exhaustively,  as was thought at the time in 1931, by the BudgetaryExperts.   Recent  discussions, however,  in the  Expenditure Commission  and  its technical Sub-Committee at  Geneva have shown  that previous enquiries were, by nomeans,  complete.  Deductions from the most recent discussions at Geneva tend to showthat, though it may he possible to express  the gross effective  expenditure of most ofthe major Powers of the world  in a  model  form, which  is capable  of  verificationagainst  the audited accounts of national expenditure, yet it is practically impossibleto do so in the case of expenditure on  the &quot; upkeep, purchase  and  manufacture &quot; ofwar material.     In  fact, any proposal to limit the expenditure on war material by means of figures isat once  involved in the technical difficulties which are inherent in any form of budgetary limitation.     12. There remains the question of the &quot; Y &quot; years&apos; average.   No reliable figuresfor the expenditure on material of the principal military Powers covering the last eight years either  in terms of   budget  expenditure or in terms  of the  Geneva  ModelStatement, are available.  The total military expenditure of Germany,  the  UnitedStates of America, France, Japan and Italy was given in Appendix IIItoC.D.C. (31)4.     These figures show clearly that expenditure in all countries, with the exception ofthe United Kingdom and Japan, has increased substantially since  1924.  It thereforefollows  that if an average be taken over the last &quot; Y &quot; years, it will give us an absoluteincrease over our existing expenditure ; whilst, at the same  time, in the case of-all  the others except Japan  and Germany, it  will show a reduction in comparison with  theexpenditure for 1931-32.  Further, the longer the period  over which the average istaken the greater will he the increase and reduction respectively.     13. The changes in  the strength and establishment of personnel of the variousPowers  have not been so marked as in the  case of expenditure.   In our own case,  ourestablishments have remained  practically the same, though  our  strengths  have shown a decrease.     For the  reasons already given in this paper,  it is necessary to reserve the rightultimately to  increase our military forces, but as we are  approximately 8,000 menbelow establishment this necessity  should not prevent us from agreeing to the proposal.     14. In conclusion,  I wish to make it  quite  clear that such  comments on  themilitary implications  that I  have made are  put  forward in no spirit of  criticism ordisagreement.   I realize only too well the need that  there is for  some  satisfactoryoutcome to the Disarmament Conference.  I should be  wanting in my duty  if I  didnot draw attention to a  few, at least, of the  military implications of  the  proposals asthey strike me at the moment, and after a rather cursory survey of the proposals ; but,in my opinion, the main  point is :  What is the spirit in which this agreement  will bemade or this proposal accepted ?   If, in  the judgment of  those who know best,  theproposals will,  generally  speaking,  be accepted  with a  feeling  of  relief and   of something accomplished as a first instalment of future agreements, then  I  feel that  thedifficulties which I  have outlined and the  chances  of evasion of the conditions laiddown, may, in the national interests, be risked.     I feel  that, provided  His Majesty&apos;s Government  adhere to  a policy of non-interference outside the Empire, combined with freedom of movement  within it, in orderto police our commitments, we  have nothing  to lose and possibly much to gain by  theadoption  of these proposals.   The points I  have  referred to  are minor  matters of adjustment.
