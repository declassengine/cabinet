CABINET.                    -1-             TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING BILL.          Memorandum by the Minister of Health.               Now that this Bill is through Committee, mycolleagues may be interested to know how it stands, andof the action proposed upon Report.               The Bill met with determined opposition in committee,   Owing to circumstances which I need notparticularise, the Government ha&amp;  no working majority.Progress was only possible by means of negotiation and conciliation.               I was beaten in four divisions, of whichparticulars are given in the Appendix attached.               The first gave statutory force to a number of departmental regulationsB   It results in some cumbrQjjslegislation;  but it is not a vital matter, and I have accepted it.               The fourth is a trivial affair.               The second and third, abGut interimcompensation, are different.   This was a vital matter;the amendments passedrare unworkable, and would havewrecked the Bill.   They had to be put right on Report.               However, after further negotiations with themovers of the amendment, it has been found possible toarrive at an accommodation.               This has been secured by an amendment already made providing that, in assessing compensation after ascheme has become operative, account shall be taken ofany additional  damage due to the refusal of permission
for interim development, on appeal;  and by a minoramendment, which I have promised to  make,  in order topro-ride a right to claim compensation in the case wherethe resolution to prepare a scheme has been revokedand a claim for compensation could have been made if thescheme had come into operation.   In consideration ofthese amendments, my moving to negative the originalwrecking amendment, which required payment ofcompensation during the interim period and before thescheme becomes operative, will not be opposed by themovers of the original amendment.             The effect of this agreement is that therewill be one decision of the Committee to negative onReport, but that will be done with the consent of themovers of the original amendment.             An accommodation on another point has given rise to criticism from the advocates of tornplanning.   The Bill in its original form allowed a plan to be made for any area.   It was objected byopponents of the Bill, and I think with justice, that people should not be troubled with the formality of plans in static areas where no development or change is In progress, or likely to be in progress.  To meet this objection, I have  limited the scope of the Billto(1) land in course of  development or likely to be    developed;(2) land already built upon if the Minister  is satisfied:     (a) that public improvements are likely  to be        made or other  development is likely  to take        place within such a period of  time  or on  such        a  scale as to  make the  inclusion  of  the  land        in a scheme expedient;  or
    (b) that the land comprises buildings or other        objects  of architectural,  historic or artistic        interest;  or    (c) that the land is so situate that the general        object of the scheme would be better secured by        its inclusion;(3) land which is neither developed nor in course of    development  nor likely to be developed if the    Minister Is  satisfied:-    (a) that the land is so situate in relation to        land already developed or in course of        development or likely to be developed as to        make its inclusion in a scheme expedient; or    (b) that it comprises objects or places of        natural interest or beauty.             It is impossible, I think, to imagine any area that ought to be planned, whether built up orundeveloped, which would not be covered by one of theabove paragraphs.(Intld)  E.H.Y,Ministry of Health,    21st May, 1932.
