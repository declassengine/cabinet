In the case of theGovernment of Bengal, I consider the views expressed of such importance that I haveprinted it in full.  I also include a brief outline of the Ordinances  at present in forceand a statement as to  the areas in which they have been  applied.   I will circulate later the considered views of the Government of  India.   INDIA OFFICE,                                                        S. H.         1st June 1932.Copy No..  A.

Express  Letter from Government  of India, Home Department,to all Local Governments  and Administrations,  No. F.  13/4/32, Poll.,.                        dated  the 20th April 1932.   Government of  India  have under, consideration the question of the policy to befollowed  in regard to the retention of powers  conferred  by  Ordinances II, III, IVand V of 1932,, which  will expire on the 3rd July next.   In. regard to the procedure for obtaining the powers required,  they are advised that if, in the opinion  of the Governor-General, there is an.  emergency at the  end ofJune which can be distinguished from the emergency existing  on the 4th January.last,  then.it would be  within the legal powers of the Governor-General to issue a freshOrdinance or Ordinances,  either previous to, or simultaneous with, the expiry of thepresent. Ordinances, which        (a)  would confer with, or without, additional powders-,  such of  the existing    powers as are held to be necessary, and       (b) would validate, where  this is held to be necessary, the continued operation    of action and  orders which would otherwise lapse, taken or  made  under the    existing Ordinances.   The Government of India have&apos;been further advised that, if&apos;an emergency is foundto exist  at the end of June  it cannot be  the  same emergency as existed on the4th January.   2. The Government of India, have  not reached any conclusion  in. regard to. thecourse they will pursue, nor will, they be in a position to reach a final decision  until they are  able, to; appraise  with: much greater accuracy  than at present, the situation that  is likely, to exist.towards:the end, of June.
    But in view of the legal position as above stated, and on the assumption that thesituation will then be such as to preclude the general abandonment of the  powers-conferred by the existing Ordinances, it may be that, subject to the approval oF theSecretary of State, they will advise the Governor-General to promulgate an Ordinancea few days previous to the 3rd of July, which will-       (i) confer such powers as are held to be necessary to meet the then emergency,     and       (ii) validate, so far as is necessary, the continued operation of action and orders     taken or made under the existing Ordinances.    It is on the  above assumptions  that  the  following proposals of a provisionalcharacter are made, and the views of Local Governments are invited.    3. The Government of India recognise that, as they are themselves unable to reachfinal conclusions so far in advance, so also Local Governments will be unable to  expressmore than provisional  views  on  some  of  the matters  now referred  to -them.  TheGovernment of India will, therefore, further  consult Local Governments towards the-end of May or the beginning of June, in order to ascertain their final views.  In themeantime, it is necessary to state the policy which it may be desirable to pursue andto make a provisional examination of the powers that may be required.    4. The Government of India are at present inclined to the view that the promulgated-gation of a single consolidated Ordinance will be preferable to the promulgation of separate Ordinances.   The single Ordinance would include only those powers thatare  considered  to be  necessary  in  any  part  of  British India at  the  time of  itspromulgation, but this  would not preclude  the issue of further Ordinances, should this later become necessary,  providing additional powers to meet  developmentsamounting to a fresh emergency.   The consolidated Ordinance would be arranged in chapters, and the extent section would be drafted so as         (i) to bring certain provisions into operation at once throughout British India,       (ii)  to extend any or all of the remaining provisions to particular Provinces by     order of the  Governor-General in Council,       (iii) to bring into operation, by order of the Local Government in the whole or     part of a Province, the provisions that had been extended  under (ii) above.    Tn practice, it would probably be convenient  for the Governor-General in  Councilto extend to various Provinces particular chapters rather than  provisions.    5. As regards the policy to be pursued in respect of        (a) the scope of the powers taken, and       (b) the extension of powers to particular Provinces,the Government of India attach great importance to the following principles:      They consider that  those powers should  be retained which are required to defeat the civil disobedience movement, having regard to the situation as it will exist at thetime of  the  promulgation of the Ordinance.  They further consider  that it  will  benecessary to  take powers to validate  the  continued  operation  of  action and orderswhere their lapse would definitely prejudice Government in fighting the  movement,:as, for instance, for the continued occupation of places of which possession has beentaken  under  the Unlawful  Association  Ordinance  and  the retention  of  securityimposed, under  section 63 of the Emergency  Powers Ordinance,  on presses and newspapers.    Subject to the above, there are cogent reasons why, first, no power should be takenin excess of requirements ;  second, the  power taken should be extended to Provincesonly in  accordance with necessity ;   aud third, the  same  principles should  govern the extension of powers within a Province.  In other words, both the scope and application  of the powers should be strictly limited  to requirements.  It has to berecognised that the promulgation  of a comprehensive Ordinance in continuation ofthe existing Ordinances will  give rise  to severe criticism both in and outside India.Charges will be freely made that it is the policy of Government to rule by Ordinancesand to ignore both public opinion aud constitutional propriety.  At this stage of thestruggle, it  is of real importance that as little ground as circumstances will permitshould  be given for these charges.  The indiscriminate assumption  and applicationof  powers  would moreover be contrary to the  spirit, if not  the letter, of the legalopinion which Government have  received, and  it might conceivably prejudice theposition of  Government, if the validity of the Ordinance were  challenged in the
-Courts.   Further, it is relevant to remember that the situation at the end of June is likely to be different in important respects from that existing on  the  4th of January. When the existing Ordinances were promulgated, Government were confronted with.a general revival of civil disobedience, the  programme of which was designed to initiate a widespread revolutionary movement and to paralyse  the administration in all its branches.   It was not possible to foresee the lines along  which  the movement would develop, and it was necessary for Government to arm themselves at all points. The programme remains, in  theory, unaltered  and there has been no change in the purpose of the movement.  Its  potential mischief is still dependent  on  the oppor- tunities  allowed  to  its  supporters.   But,  while  these  considerations forbid  any relaxation of effort and preclude  the  abandonment of necessary powers, the situation is now in some respects clearer than it was in January last.  A  great deal has already been done to weaken the movement; its  vigour  varies from Province to Province ; some items of the initial programme have definitely failed, and generally, it is possible to appraise with greater accuracy the forms  that activities are likely to take and the powers required to meet them.    For  these reasons  the  Government  of  india consider  that, in  the  absence of unforeseen developments, it should  be practicable  to curtail both  the scope  and application of the powers ;  and they have no doubt whatever that, so far as this can be done consistent with safety, the moral position of Government both in India and abroad will be  strengthened.   In particular, if it is possible  to surrender the use-of  particular powers  in whole  Provinces  or   districts  simultaneously  with  the&quot;promulgation of  the  Ordinance, clear   proof would  be given  of the  sincerity of Government declarations that they do not intend  to  rely on  Ordinances longer than is actually necessary.  The  Government of  India, therefore,  ask for the assistance-and co-operation of Local Governments in these respects.    6.  It would appear to follow from the above principles that        (a) no additional  power should  be taken which is  not definitely  necessary.     The Government of India will, therefore, not be prepared to reconsider proposals     of Local Governments  which they have been  previously unable to accept, or to     consider fresh proposals for new powers, unless a convincing case is established;       (6) when  existing powers are retained,  their scope  should   be amended, if     experience has shown that the relevant provision is too widely drafted.       The Government of  India  have several cases of this kind in  mind and they     would invite suggestions from Local Governments.   There is, however, likely to     be little scope for amendment in this direction ;       (c) existing powers should be abandoned where they are unnecessary.  This is     discussed in  the next paragraph ;       (d) the  initial  extension of powers  to a particular Province or  within the     Province to a particular district should be determined  by the requirements of     the Province or district at the time of  promulgation of the Ordinance.   While     the Government of  India will be prepared  at once to extend those powers that     are necessary and, if occasion arises, to extend other powers without delay, they     deprecate the extension of powers in anticipation of developments that on a fair     view of the situation do not seem likely to occur.    7. It is not at present possible to make an accurate appreciation  of the existing powers that it will be necessary to retain.  But, judging from the situation as it now&apos; exists and the course of events  during the past three months, the  Government of India are doubtful whether it will be possible to abandon in  their entirety the powers contained in any of the four Ordinances now in force, except possibly those contained in the Unlawful Instigation  Ordinance.   They anticipate that it will  be necessary to retain practically unchanged  the provisions  of  the Prevention  of  Molestation and Boycotting Ordinance,  as amended, and  of the Unlawful Association  Ordinance, and to retain many of the powers contained in the Emergency Powers Ordinance.  On the other hand, the  figures of convictions  furnished to the  Government  of India- indicate that it,  has been necessary to make comparatively little use of the Unlawful Instigation Ordinance,  except in the  United Provinces.  In other Provinces the-attempts to carry on no-rent or no-revenue campaigns appear to have been of a minor- character, and if there  were  no deterioration in the position in  this respect  the Local Governments concerned  might be able to  deal  with these activities by  the use of-. section  17 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act of  1908 and  other powers.  If,i therefore, the situation in the United Provinces were such as to permit the abrogation
 of these powers without incurring the  risk of  the  recrudescence of the no-rent campaign, the Government of India are inclined  to  think that  it might be possible to. exclude the relevant powers from the. consolidated Ordinance, it  being understood that they would  be  prepared to advise  the promulgation of an ad hoc Ordinance, should  the necessity subsequently arise.   Were  it practicable to take this course, clear evidence would be given of the desire of  Government to restrict the  scope of powers; but, although the  Government of  India  attach importance to this aspect of the case, they recognise that this advantage might easily be outweighed if encourage- ment were given to no-revenue and no-rent campaigns by the abandonment  of  these particular powers.   They would be grateful for  the  views  of  Local Governments- on this matter and, in particular, of the Government of the United Provinces in regard to the necessity, so far as it can now be estimated, of retaining the powers.     As regards the Emergency Powers Ordinance, it appears  probable  that it will be necessary  to retain  many of the powers.  At the same  time, it vtx&amp;y be possible to dispense with those of which little or no use has been made.   The  Government of India have not  specific information  as to  the extent  to which use has been  made of particular provisions, but they are inclined to think that it will not be necessary to retain sections 8, 9, 13, 14 and 16 of the Ordinance and that it  may be possible also to dispense with sections 0,  7 and 12.    8. So far as an estimate can  at  present be made, it would  appear probable that it will  be  necessary to  bring into immediate operation throughout British India         (a) the provisions of the Ordinance which  will repeat the following sections of      the existing Ordinances :              Sections  61 and 63 of the Emergency  Powers Ordinance,             Section 10 of the Unlawful Association Ordinance ; and        (o) a new provision which will continue the operation of action taken and orders      made  under the existing Ordinances.    9. It is requested that the Government of India may be favoured, not later than the 10th May, with the views of Local Governments on the general questions of policy above discussed and on the  particular matters mentioned  in  paras. 7  and 8.  It will be.of value if  an  indication can be given  of  the extent to  which,  on a present appreciation of  the  situation, it  may be  possible to withdraw powers  from areas in which, they are now  in  force.  Subsequent to the  10th  May the Government  of  India will  endeavour to furnish Local Governments with a provisional draft of the Ordinance and, as already stated, will afford them the opportunity of a final expression of their opinions about the end of May or beginning of June.   In the meantime, it  is  to be clearly  understood that the suggestions contained in this letter do  not represent the - considered conclusions of the Government of India and are of a provisional character.         Letter from the Government  of Bengal to the Government of India, Home                 Department, No. 223 P.S.D., dated the 6th May 19S2. -   I have the honour to refer to the Government of India!s Secret letter No.  13/4/32,. Pol)., dated 20th April 1932, and to reply as follows.    2. The  Government  of  India explain the legal position as regards the method by which, the  powers conferred by  Ordinances II, III,  IV and V of 1932 may he-  obtained afresh after they, lapse in the ordinary course on 3rd July next.  It is no,t- . necessary to discuss  this point except to observe  that,  while the legal theory still persists that the emergency which  at the end of June justifies the promulgation of an, Ordinance must be a different emergency from that which justified the Ordinance :Qn&apos;, the; 4th January, it is satisfactory that  it now  appears to be  possible to obtain. these powers without,  as was previously held to be necessary, having to permit, a.&quot;definite interval of time to lapse between one Ordinance and its  successor.     3. On the1 assumption that at the end  of June the  situation will then be such as -to- preclude the general abandonment  of  the  powers  conferred  by the  existing Ordinances, the Government of India contemplate the possibility of  the promulgation of an Ordinance a few days  previous to 3rd July which will on the one hand confer - the-  powers necessary&apos; to meet  the then  emergency, and on the other validatetbe^ continued  operation  of action and orders appertaining to the  existing Ordinances.. :Iu this  connection they make certain provisional proposals and invite the ad interim- Jopinion of Local Governments preliminary to more final views about the end of May.
    4.  Before  considering the  detailed proposals of &apos;the  Government of  India if of dealing  with  the anticipated or assumed emergency,  I  am  directed to say at this point that the Governor in Council is clearly of opinion that the assumption that -&apos;a state of emergency will still exist  on 3rd July is fully justified and may be  acted  on without  hesitation.  Before the Ordinances  came into force  last January the  Local Government had ample indication that it was the intention of  Congress to launch a fresh campaign of civil disobedience, as was  proved, for instance, by the Berhampore Conference  resolutions.   The  effect of the  issue of Ordinances was instantaneous.&apos; There  will be  no such  warning  this time, for the simple reason that the existence of Ordinances  prevents the open working up of an agitation.  But the fact must be faced and accepted  that the situation  is held under  control only by the abnormal powers that Government now possess, and indeed those powers ought to be among the normal weapons of  Government instead  of  being treated as abnormal and unusual.  As the Commissioner of Police, Calcutta, observes, &quot;If  the powers  now  conferred and exercised under the Ordinances, which I  shall discuss later in  detail, were to lapse without  replacement the  situation would rapidly, if not instantaneously, deteriorate into the  anarchical conditions  which prevailed in 1930.   The weekly reports that I have had the  honour  to submit  to Government from time  to  time show  that the movement is merely quiescent under the compulsion  of the powers now exercised by Government,.   I have no doubt whatever  that in the absence  of these powers every mischief-maker now quiescent will  immediately resume his  former  mischievous-activities with renewed vigour and persistence.  A consideration  which I should like to submit to Government is that the civil  disobedience movement in its main activities is the  result of a lawyer&apos;s study of the  defects in  the existing law  and the Ordinances are merely a  patchwork to  repair the gaps discovered to  exist in the ordinary law. So long as persons exist who deliberately and determinately take advantage of those defects in our legal system to harass and  tyrannize over the peaceful citizens, so long will the  powers referred to be required to neutralize their anarchical activities.&quot;  The forces  of disorder are still there and it only needs the opportunity for them  to renew their evil activities. There is not the smallest indication it would be contrary to  all-experience  to expect   it that the organisers of mischief have  any  intention  of abandoning their  programme.   The  fact  that civil disobedience made  so little headway in this Province is solely due to  the prompt promulgation of the Ordinances, and once those powers  have  lapsed  exactly the  same situation will arise again, necebsitating  the  same measures to   control it.   As one  Commissioner observes, there  are a very large number of  people who  &quot; will be encouraged  to  subversive action as soon as  they perceive that  there  are  no  effective powers to impede their activities immediately  applicable.&quot;  This really points to the key to the situation, which is to have the  powers  there, in being, not  necessarily to use them.  It has been a not infrequent  experience that the existence of the powers was enough and that it was not in practice necessary to use them.  It  is,  therefore, necessary  in the  opinion of the Governor  in Council  at least  to have  available in  posse  all,-or practically all, the powers  conferred  by  Ordinances II V, and it is as necessary now as it was in January that Government should be armed at all points.  While conceding  that  much  has  been done to  weaken  the  movement, that  its  vigour varies from  Province  to Province, and  that some items of the  programme have failed, Bis  Excellency in Council- is very doubtful  whether it is even now possible to forecast  the course of events more accurately than to say that once the special powers  are gone, every form of  activity  that was tried  in  the past will with-certainty be  tried together with many  others  that have not  yet  been  tried, and that  therefore  complete  preparation  will  be  as  necessary on  3rd  July  as  on-4th January.   It  is inconceivable that  any future programme  of the Congress party will be  a whit less comprehensive than those of  the past.   The tendency is the other way, towards   greater width and  variety  of  scope, and the ingenuity of its promoters is unbounded.  It is true that certain lines of activity may be abandoned because they found little favour with the public and the counter  methods of Government were too-effective, but  fresh ones will  be found.   So long as there has been no change in the purpose  of  the movement, i.e.  the  subversion of  ordered  government,  so long- Government  cannot afford  to abate its precautions.   The importance of this aspect -of the case is in the  opinion of the  Governor  in  Council so great, that  he would recommend that the greatest caution should be \ised in any movement in the direction of curtailing  the scope  of  the rjowers  which have proved so  effective.  He fully iunderstands the anxiety of the Government of India to strengthen the moral position -of Government and recognises that the  surrender Of powers  previously taken  ought
to be proof in the eyes of the world of Governments good intentions, but he does feelvery strongly that there is  a danger in going too far in  this direction aud losing thesubstance of safety for the  shadow of other people&apos;s good will.   As one experiencedBengal officer puts it, &quot; the amount of odium will be exactly the same for au adequateas for an inadequate Ordinance.&quot;   There should be only one test of  governmental.action, and that is whether it is necessary or not in the interests of good government.and  law and order, and whether it is calculated to  give  that  protection from  illegaland  oppressive tyranny which the community at large is entitled  to  expect, and it is -not  worth while to sacrifice  these objects in the hope of obtaining a good press.Further, it is the general  experience in  this Province that  the kind of (government.that gets support is a strong one, i.e. one which  shows and uses-its strength, not onewhich displays only that forbearance which is mistaken for weakness and  keeps its-strength so far in the background that its existence is forgotten, while those whom it ought to protect are left  the helpless victims of  Congress tyranny.  This attitude -has been specially noticeable among a timid, because easily harassed, class, that of the traders, who since the existence of the  Ordinances  have been displaying a steadilygrowing confidence.   Such confidence, a delicate  plant which can only flourish underthe shelter of something more powerful  than  itself, will at once  fade and  wither if&quot;the protection which Government can give by means of  the Ordinances is  removed.Gladly, therefore, as  the  Local Government  will assist and  co-operate  with theGovernment of India in  all possible ways, they do feel  that  it is possible to  devotetoo much thought, and effort to proving the sincerity of Governments intentions  to-the detriment possibly of good government and  at the risk of losing more than canreally be expected to be gained.   5. These more general considerations  apart,  I  am now to refer to  the  details of&quot;the Government of  India&apos;s proposals.  A single consolidated Ordinance would  in theopinion of the Governor in Council be  very suitable, and the method of applicationoutlined  in para. 4 of the Government  of India&apos;s  letter would be convenient.  the bengal Government also welcome the assurance that the  Government of India will be-prepared to issue further Ordinances should further developments arise necessitatingfurther ad hoc powers.   0. His  Excellency in Council is in  agreement  with the  Government of India&apos;remarks in para. 5 of their letter regarding the principles to be pursued in taking or-applying the proposed powers, on the understanding that, as  in January, it is  clearlykept in view that Government must maintain the  initiative with itself, and not let itpass to Congress.  These principles in fact involve no departure from  present practice,.which always has been to limit the scope and application of powers  to requirements.As the Local Government conceives  it, it is the intention of the Government of India tohave ready an Ordinance containing all or practically all the provisions of the existingOrdinances, and that portions of this Ordinance will be extended  as required.   As far-as can be seen at present it  will certainly be necessary to  have  from the beginning.powers corresponding  to  those contained  (subject  to  my remarks  later on)  in-.Ordinances II, IV and V.   The position as regards Ordinance III is at present not clear.  It has  not  been used  hitherto  in Bengal,  but there are indications  that it.may be required even now in  certain  parts of Bankura, Hooghly and Midnapore.Whether  it  would be possible to surrender, as the  Government of India suggest,..the  use  of particular &apos;powers in the wdiole of certain districts  or not is  extremely doubtful.   The matter wall be carefully  considered, but at present  there is  little-or no indication that this is possible.    7.  On the points set  out in  para. C  of the Government  of India letter  I am to--observe as follows :        (a) At present the  Governor in Council is not likely to ask for any additional     powers beyond those provided by the existing Ordinances, though he is prepared&apos;     to put up a convincing case should  a real necessity arise.       (b) The Local Government are at present unable  to suggest any amendment of:     the scope of existing  powers in the  direction of curtailment, not at any rate any     . amendment of the kind that would be noticeable or valuable from the point of     view of the moral position of Government either in India or abroad.  They feel at.     present that it would  be better  to limit application rather than scope.       (c)  Unnecessary  existing powers  would  certainly  be abandoned, but  the-     Government of Bengal is unable to  say at present that  there are any such.
      (d) His Excellency in Council notes the principles on which powers are to he    extended.   He has  no intention of  requesting  the extension of powers in    anticipation of developments which  cannot  fairly be  expected to occur, but he    reserves to himself the right to appreciate the situation and ask for the immediate    extension of powers whenever his own experience and knowledge and that of his-    officers demand it.   8. The Governor  in  Council entirely agrees with the Government  of  India intheir surmise that it is unlikely to be possible to  abandon in entirety Ordinances  II,.IV and V.   Ordinance III, the Unlawful  Instigation Ordinance, has not  so  far been extended to this Province.  As  I have  indicated above, it may be necessary in  thefuture and the Governor in Council will not hesitate then to apply for it.  At the timeof writing, on a fair view of the  situation it does  not  appear to be  necessary, and  hewill certainly be prepared to deal as far as possible by means of other powers with thekind of  activity at  which the Ordinance  strikes.  On the question whether or  notthe provisions of this Ordinance  should be included in the consolidated Ordinance, theGovernment of Bengal would on general grounds be inclined to  include it  simply because the dangers of such  a campaign are so  great and the existence of powers,even if not used, is  definitely  a deterrent.   He agrees also that in this Province it willbe necessaryto retain the Prevention of Molestation  and Boycott Ordinance and  theUnlawful Association Ordinance and is unable to suggest any  changes of importancein their provisions.   He is in full agreement with the view  that it will be  necessary  to retain  many of&quot;the powers of the Emergency Powers Ordinance.  The Government of India  mention the possibility of dispensing with the provisions of certain sections of that Ordinance,i.e. sections 8, 9, 13, 14, 16 and  possibly sections 6, 7 and 12.   In this Province little-or no use has been  made  of  sections 8, 9, 14, and it would probably not matter verymuch if they were omitted.   Section 13 has been used  effectively in some  districts.and it is a useful means of bringing pressure to  bear on certain  people.  Sections and 7 should in the opinion of the Governor in Council  be kept.   Section 12 is notvery necessary as very similar powers  exist  under the Police Act.  Section  16  was.used in some places to prevent persons going by rail to attend  the  Delhi Conferenceand should be kept.   But while agreeing that it is a good thing to remove redundant material from anenactment of this sort, His Excellency in  Council is unable to see how the removal of&quot;a few sections from the  Ordinance can go any distance at  all towards strengthening the moral position of Government either in India or abroad.   It would in fact merelyevoke, and justifiably evoke, hostile criticism to cite such trifling omissions as proof ofgood intentions.   3. The Local Government agree that so far as tliis Province is concerned it will be-necessary to bring into  immediate operation the provisions of the Ordinance whichwill repeat sections 61 and 63 of the Emergency Powers Ordinance and  section 10 ofthe Unlawful Association Ordinance.  He attaches special importance to  the provision which deals with subversive writing in  the  Press and in fact, as the Government ofIndia  are  aware,  has  recently  sent  up  proposals  in  this  Governments letterNo. 98 P.S.D., dated 25th April  1932, for permanent legislation.   There is no doubt also that  a provision to continue the operation of  action taken,and  orders made  under the  existing Ordinances is most necessary.   The continuitythus given to Government policy is of vital importance and does away with the grave-disadvantages attaching to all temporary legislation.    Summary of replies from the Governments of Madras, Bombay, United Provinces,    Punjab,  Burma,  Bihar  and  Orissa,  Central  Provinces, Assam,  North-West              Frontier Province,  and the Chief Commissioner of Delhi.Madras.    The Madras Government are  in  general agreement with  paras.  1-5 of  theGovernment  of India&quot;s letter.   They  see few signs  of any active revulsion  among-the general public against the Civil Disobedience  Movement and. apprehend that any relaxation of the  present firm policy would  give  it  a  new  impetus aud lose theGovernment ground  that might be difficult to- recover.     963                                                                 B
   Emergency Powers Ordinance. Section  63 only has been  applied  in Madras andthe Government  do not anticipate that any of the remaining provisions  will berequired.   Unlawful Instigation Ordinance. The Government  of  Madras  are  inclined  tothink that they will be able to dispense with this Ordinance, which has been  applied in three districts only, on the understanding that its provisions would be  extended tothe Presidency  in the case of a serious attempt to start a no-rent campaign.   Unlawful  Association  Ordinance. The  Government  of  Madras  regard  thecontinuance of its provisions substantially unchanged as desirable.   Prevention of Molestation and Boycotting Ordinance.- The Government of Madrasregard Chapter I as essential, but would probably  refrain from bringing Chapters and HI into force.Bombay.   The Government  of Bombay regard  renewed  powers as  indispensable andapprehend that, if these are not  taken, the situation, perhaps after some slightdelay, would be very much what  it was before the present Ordinances were promulgated-gated.   To avoid, however, any question as  to the legality of a new Ordinance, theywould prefer that the Government of India Act should be amended  so as  to permit the existing Ordinances to remain in force beyond the 3rd July.   Emergency Powers Ordinance. Of the provisions suggested by the Governmentof India for possible omission, the Government of Bombay would deprecate theabandonment of the powers given by sections 6, 7 and 16.   Unlawful Instigation Ordinance. Though the Government of Bombay think  it probable that this Ordinance  will  not be required until next autumn, they consider itnecessary  to  continue the powers that  they may be available for immediate use  atany time.   Unlawful Association Ordinance. The Government  of Bombay agree that it willbe necessary to continue the powers practically unchanged.   Prevention of Molestation and Boycotting  Ordinance. Required.United Provinces.   The Government of the United Provinces anticipate that August will  be a criticalmonth as many persons serving sentences of six months&apos; imprisonment will then be at liberty.  They are considering the- introduction of a Bill in the Legislative Councilincorporating  the provisions  of the  Unlawful  Instigation and the Prevention  ofMolestation  and  Boycotting Ordinances with  possibly one  or two  clauses from theEmergency  Powers  Ordinance.   The Bill will not be introduced unless there is agood prospect of the Council accepting it without excessive amendment, and should it have to be abandoned the powers described in para. S of the Government of India&apos;sletter will undoubtedly be required.  In that case a start might  possibly  be made by extending the provisions  of the new Ordinance only to those districts in  which therewas  open agitation, but  this  might have the effect  of diverting  the  attention  ofagitators to  those areas to which it did not apply.   Emergency Powers Ordinance. Only sections 4 and 10 have been at all extensivelyused.  So far as the United  Provinces are concerned  sections  6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13,14, 16 and the whole of Chapters IV and V could safely bo excluded from any futureOrdinance.   Unlawful  Instigation  Ordinance. The  United Provinces Government considerthat its renewal will be necessary unless a  very marked change takes place before theend of June.   Unlawful  Association  Ordinance. This has been freely used and is required.   Prevention of Molestation  and  Boycotting  Ordinance. The United ProvincesGovernment agree that there can be no question of abandoning these powers.
Burma.   The civil disobedience movement has not extended to Burma, and  only section 63of the Emergency Powers Ordinance applies there.  The Burma Government wish toretain  the powers  given by this so that action may be  taken against the publicationof news or pictures likely to excite Indo-Burman feeling. Bihar and Orissa.    The Government of Bihar and Orissa consider that the anti-Government movement is suspended only and waiting to break out again when opportunity offers.  If powers were allowed to lapse and an outbreak occurred all the improvement achieved in the last few months would be  undone  and the  confidence  in  Government, which is beginning to revive both in  the villages and among their servants, would receive a severe set-back.    Emergency Powers  Ordinance. Apart from section 63 the Ordinance has  been-applied in  four  districts only,  and only sections  4, 26 and  28  and  consequential sections have been used.  The  Government of Bihar and Orissa would retain these powers, but do not consider that others will be necessary.    Unlawful  Instigation Ordinance. Has  been applied to  one district only.  The Government of Bihar and Orissa are prepared to allow it to lapse.    Unlawful Association Ordinance. The Government of Bihar and Orissa  consider that this Ordinance has contributed more than anything else towards the breaking up of the civil disobedience organisation and that it is essential that the powers given by it should be continued  without any hiatus.    Prevention of Molestation and Boycotting Ordinance. Government  of Bihar  and Orissa consider that  the whole  of the Ordinance should be retained and suggest that the provisions against picketing should be embodied in permanent legislation.Central Provinces.    The  Central  Provinces would prefer continuance of  the  special  powers? by legislation, certification being employed if necessary.    Emergency  Powers  Ordinance. Only section  63 is in force.   This should becontinued.    Unlawful Instigation  Ordinance. Central Provinces  Government consider that-this need not be renewed.    Unlawful Association  Ordinance. Central Provinces would like  these provisions-to remain in force, but if  pressed would dispense with sections 3, 4 and 7.    Prevention of Molestation and Boycotting Ordinance. Doubts have been expressed-as to the usefulness of the Ordinance, but the Central Provinces Government considerthat  the balance  of  advantage lies with its  retention.  It has put a stop to overt^picketing, which gave the impression that Congress had equal power with Government. Punjab.    The Punjab Government agree that the situation in July will call for the retention-of special powers.    Emergency Powers Ordinance. The Punjab Government  would be  prepared to dispense with sections 7, 8, 9, 10,  11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and Chapter V.  With some hesitation they would agree to surrender section 26 also.    Unlawful Instigation Ordinance. So far as the Punjab Government can  foresee this will not be required.    Unlawful  Association.  Ordinance. The Punjab Government consider that all the provisions should be retained.    Prevention of Molestation  and  Boycotting Ordinance. The whole  Ordinance should be retained.
Assam.   The Government of Assam agree generally with  the  Government of India as to-the principles to be  followed and the action to  be taken  on the  expiry  of  theOrdinances.  So far as they can see it will be necessary to reintroduce for Assam onlythe provisions of the Prevention of Molestation  and  Boycotting and the UnlawfulAssociation Ordinances in addition to section 63 of the Emergency Powers Ordinance.North-West Frontier Province.    Emergency Powers Ordinance. The North-West  Frontier Province Governmentcould dispense with sections 8, 9, 13 and 14.    Unlawfid  Instigation  Ordinance. This  might  be  allowed  to  lapse on  theunderstanding that it would be revived if necessary.Delhi.   Emergency Powers Ordinance. Sections  3, 4, 10, 17, 18,  19,  20, the whole  of chapter III, the section dealing with Summary Courts in Chapter IV, and Chapter VIwill probably be required.   Unlawfid Instigation  Ordinance. Can probably be dispensed with.   Unlawful Association Ordinance. The whole will, it is expected, be needed.   Prevention of Molestation and Boycotting Ordinance. The full provisions should!be re-enacted, but to start with Chapters II and III could be permitted to lapse.
