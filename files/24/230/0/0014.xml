CAB I IT B T.              Age for admission to elementally schools.                                                        Copy ITo, &apos; $        Memorandum by the President of the Board of Education,,.165(32)                                                   &quot;        The following question has been put down for Thursday next   May 26th:-   *51.   Captain North - To ask the president of the Board of Education          if he will state what would be the estimated economy involved          by raising the age for admission to elementary schools from          five to six years;  and whether it is the intention of the          Government to take any action on such lines0          Subject to the approval of the Cabinet I propose to give          the following answer:              &quot;Unless legislation was passed excluding all children          under six from the schools for all purposes the amount of          saving would he difficult to estimate but would probably          be small.              On the assumption that such legislation was passed and          that no steps were taken to replace the educational and          social facilities thus withdrawn the total saving to the          Exchequer is estimated to he about  2 million a year.   In          some areas, and especially in the Counties, an increased          burden would be thrown on the rates, as the  saving  to  the          authorities In expenditure would be less  than the loss in          grant a   While the effect would vary in different localities,          the authorities as a whole would lose to  the extent of          about  125,000 a yearu               I have not at present in contemplation  any change in          the law of  school attendance.&quot;        As  my  colleagues may have observed this matter has also   recently been canvassed in  the Press  and  as  it  is  an  educational    issue  of major  importance,  I desire to have  their  concurrence  in   any  answer  which  I give.         The exclusion of  children under  six  has  a  long history                               1.Document is the property of His Britannic  i/fajesty1 s  Government.
but  I  need  only mention  a  few salient  points.    It was  one ofthe  proposals  made by  the  Geddes  Committee  in December,  1921, andit was&apos;*igain examined by  the  hay Committee but no mention of  it ismade, in  their  report issued  last  summer.    It has been  consideredby various  Ministers of  Education,  especially Mr, Fisher andLord Eustace Percy.    Mr.  Fisher  submitted  a memorandum to aCabinet  Committee in 1922  in which  he  set out the pros  and cons&quot;but  it v/as  then decided  that the  most  that  could be done was togive parents the option  of keeping  at  home  their children undersix.   This  policy was embodied in  an  Economy Bill which was read a second time  in the summer  of 1922 but lapsed  owing  to  a changeof Government,,     Lord Eustace Percy  took the  view  that  the  care of  children under  six should not fall  upon public  funds except where badsocial conditions render it  imperative, but he  said of  theproposal that  all children under  six should be  turned out of the schools  &quot;the objection to  this drastic proposal is that  I do notbelieve we  should be able  to carry  it  through the House  at all,we,should have  the strongest opposition from members  of  our ownparty which  I believe would  compel  us  to withdraw any suchmeasure&quot;.     It is quite true that in foreign  countries generally sixis the age at which attendance at school is required, but my information  is  that in these countries, in  industrial areas atany  rate, they  have found  it necessary to provide for the care and  supervision of children  under that age.  It is a  matter ofcommon agreement that were the children under six to  becompulsorily excluded in this country  some provision  would haveto be made to  compensate for the  social and health benefits which are now obtained through the  schools.
          I am of the opinion that the withdrawal of facilities towhich people have become accustomed for nearly two generationswould be gravely resented, especially by the poorest classesof the community,                                     DeM.rd May  193 S3,
