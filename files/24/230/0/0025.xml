Received in the Colonial Office at*20 &amp;,m. on 25th May, 1932*Xvmmiate No Q64 - Secret c          Your private and personal ielegragB of 23rd Mayo   thePastoral stands and therefore the position ^hich caused the          suspension of the Constitution is       being re--assortedby the Bishops with the aggravating circumstance that they Ignorewhat has taken place since 19?0 including the Royal Commission sstrongly sSEpxesoed belief on pages 164-165 of their Reportc          The answer to the second question in your telegram isthat the re-affirmation of the Paatoral undoubtedly will preventmany electors from voting in accordance with political convictionsand that &amp;, Nationalist majority which, in any event, 1 anticipatewill be increased considerably.          In answer to your third question the Leaders of bothConstitutional and Labour parties are most emphatic that electionshould take place next month despite the harm to their prospectswhich they admit that circular will doc   The Nationalist party isof course anni^us for the elections.   The suspension of theelections would be violently resented by the three parties.          The answer to your question four (a) is that in the e^entof suspension I anticipate no difficulty in carrying on machineryof Administration as heretofore? although the Government would betarget for criticism by all political parties.,   Your questionfour (b)B there probably would be some attempt at disorder whichhowever could be handled with the assistance of the garrison.                                                              Your
          Your question five.   My advice which is of coursegiven solely from local point of view, is that in view of theemuhatio views of all political parties elections should now take  * ?plaee(corrupt groups) provided that you are prepared strongly tosupport me in all reserved matters especially those affectinglanguages in Law Courts and schools and, if necessary9 as regardsthe police..   Owing to proportional representation there in nolikelihood of the complete extinction of the Constitutional andLabour Parties0          If you should from non-local point of view decideotherwise I suggest for consideration that method to be adoptedtaigi.it be to stay the election for a period of six months when thequestion of holding one or not should be reconsidered.-   But from my point of view I should regret it if such a step were foundnecessaryo   With regard to the first sentence of your telegram                                          9I should point out that the penalty in Pastoral of 19-30 is notexconsrmmication but that involved, by the Commission of mortal sinc

In continuation of  my secret telegram ofMay 24th you no doubt have  taken into consideration thatthe elections were stopped  in. 1930 under the reserved.powers ostensibly because grave disturbances ware feared,which cannot at present be  said to be the ease.  There isno clause in the  Constitution under which elections ca^be stopped owing  to  the intimidation of voters..          As tiie  elections  if they are now held will takeplace under conditions  never  foreseen by the &apos;!oyal commission would you not be  justified  in going beyond their recommendafeciby adopting my suggestion on  following matters (i) the judges (see my secret despatch May 7th paragraph 3). (ii) the magistrates,.          While as reported in my previous telegram leadersof Constitutional Party especially &quot;&quot;&quot;t rick land ar^ insistanton the elections  being  proceeded with there is a section ofthe party including  the brothers Bartoio in favour of their being stayed.  Joseph Bartolo is Reuters correspondent hers,.          This does  not affect my conviction that from localstandpoint it would  be  a mistake not to proceed with theelections.
PABAPHRASE T3SLEG-RAM from the Secretary of State for the colonies to the Governor of Malta..              (Sent 4,0 p.ra,e 26th May, 1932c)          The Cabinet after a full review of the whole position  -including your telegram Ko064 decided that it is impossible forthe election to be allowed to proceed.   The Cabinet consideraction of Bishops in re-affirming the pastoral of 1930 completelyfalsifies the expectations on which the Royal Commission baaedtheir recommendations and reproduces in an aggravated formconditions which led Labour Government to hold no election and to suspend the constitution.          I should add for your private information that I sawLord FitsAlan after Cabinet,,  He said he did not 3ee what otheragtion wa could take.   I appreciate your local difficulties butin all the circumstances I am sure it would be impossible for theGovernment here to adopt any other course*&apos;   After the determinedstand taken by the Labour Government we should be surrendering inaggravated circumstances on the very issue which with universalapproval here they regarded as of cardinal importance.          I shall mafce a considered statement in Parliament onMonday, the text of which 1 will telegraph to you.   You shouldtake no action till my statement has been made,.   After it has beenmade you should make an Ordinance suspending the electionindefinitely,,          By further Letters Patent I shall enact reforms withregard to judges and police as set out in draft Bill.   The LawOfficers advise (1) that there is power by Letters Patent to enactall provisions contained in the Parliamentary Bill
     (2) that Letters Patent of 1930 and everything done  thersundeBXB valid and that a validating act is unnecessaryo   X ahall,therefore,  not introduce a Bill *

I urge therefore that should electionsbe suspended a snort Act be passed urgently firstlyvalidating legislation secondly giving powers to His &quot;&quot;a^estyto revoke the Constitution with reservation to him of powerto restore it with such modification and under suchconditions as he may think proper..

Personal for Secretary of State  DoCdL,           Your St*;rat   n; I  rsonal telegram  7th Kay, 1 am ranch  relieve!  to  hear  Cabinet will  reconsider decision not to hold elections.   I would like to  emphasiss as my appreciation  will not  arrive in time for meeting that viiitaa of the pi ace is the  Church.  It  will be playing into the latter*s hands  to stop elections.           It  has  been  my endeavour up  to now to make r-eace between the Church  and compact parties.   I now know that I have bnon wrong and  that Church is out only for its political  nower  in  Slalta and nothing else.  Church&apos;s power can be broken only  by  elections being held with Pastoral still in force.   result will be that compacty^ti^s will gain in (?  group emitted) and powers of  the Church will thus eventually  be threatened.  Church will be forced by this to look to  us for protection and in consequence instead of hindering  to aid  and assist us.   ,eaknning of the Churchmust co^ie from tht   onle of Malta themselves and any attempt on  the part  of His  lajesty&apos;s -government to opnoseattitude Church has  adopted,  would have opposite effect I fear.  At the sa \e txm&quot;. I  reco nond making stronglyworded protest against action of Bishops.  The latter deserve this.,   Such  protest will materially assist  comnactF&amp;rti 53 and might create small rift between the Nationalists and the Church.          1 am most anxious not to m;ike any announcement                                               before

The above,; r-jnte so  far uncorroborated statement by                                                       Mabel  -
Mabel Strickland but if it is proved to be correct that Archbishop has accepted apology then the questions will be (a) should H.M. Government hold its hand and see if now Pastoral is issued or (b) continue as if nothing was changed. I am personally strongly in favour of ? course as the Bishops deserve strongest condemnation for their behaviour. If Cabinet decides to hold elections I hope they will express this condemnation and make it clear that they have only agreed to the elections taking place owing to (?) recommendation by the Royal Commission although given under ? premises (b) the wishes of the leaders of all the political parties especially those against which the Pastoral and Circular are directed (c) recommendation put up by me and this letter will strengthen my hand in dealing with all parties. If the Cabinet agree to the elections taking place strongly recommend that I should be authorised to make statement as early as possible to fore? ? of new (? Pastoral). If new Pastoral is issued it will be used to attempt to justify the action taken up to date by ? and to save the face of the Church completely. I fancy you will consider this to be most undersirable. What Mabel Strickland has said has now been confirmed officially, by Monsignor de Pir? acting on behalf of the Archbishop I received a visit this afternoon from the Monsignor.

Original Decypher of a telegram from the Governor Malta Dated 30th May 1932. Received in the Colonial Office at 12.18 p.m. on 30th May, 1932.

MOST IMMEDIATE.

No. 74. D.C.3. Personal. for the Secretary of State. In continuation of latter part of my secret telegram of May 29th No. 73. Monsignor De Pire when visiting me yesterday afternoon informed me on behalf of the Archbishop that (? he) had accepted apology which was being taken to Rome by Bishop of Gozo that evening with the strong recommendation in favour of its acceptance by the Vatican. De Pire said that the Archbishop anticipated its acceptance by the Vatican and the issue of a new Pastoral within one week.

I still consider that the course advocated by me the best on three grounds given in my telegram No. 73 of 29th May but should the Cabinet decide otherwise I recommend that, in view of these now developments there should be added decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government to suspend the elections a rider to the effect that if and when a new Pastoral is issued enabling the electorate to vote freely His Majesty Government will be prepared to reconsider their decision. By this means the onus would be placed where it properly belongs - on ecclesiastical authorities.
