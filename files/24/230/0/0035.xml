QCP.187(52) .                     The   Employment__Sltua bion.               Memo ran dun &quot;by  the Minister  of Labour.      1.    On  the eve of  the  Lausanne Conference  I think it  right  to      call the attention  of my  colleagues  to the  present and      prospective employment  gituation.      2.    Between 25th April and the 23rd May there  was a rise  in  the      Live Register  of 89,125.    This followed an earlier rise  during      the  previous month  of 04,849.   There has thus  been a total      deterioration  between 21st March  and 23rd May of 173,974.    This      figure does not entirely represent the full increase in unemploy-      ment since it  takes no  account of persons who have ceased to      register on being disallowed benefit under  the  Anomalies  and Needs      Test Regulations.      3.    The increase of 09,125 during May is more  than accounted for      by an increase in temporary stoppages amounting to 114,101;  there      was an actual decrease  of  24,976  in  the numbers registered as      wholly unemployed.    Cotton and woollen textiles between  them very      largely account for the increase  and, in the case of cotton  at  any      rate, may be attributed to extended  &quot;Whitsuntide holidays.    In      addition the increase is in some  degree inflated owing to the      floods which took place during the week-end preceding the count.      In the North East for example  the floods resulted in stoppages  of      work in certain collieries in  the Doncaster area.      4.   . But after full allowance  has been made for these factors,  on      the most optimistic reading of the situation it must be said that      there has been no improvement  in  the employment position  during      May.      5.    This is particularly disappointing since we are now  at  the      point of the year when employment should be at  its best.   The      outlook for the immediate  future  presents certain disquieting      features.f
 6.    The improvement in enp3.oyment which took place between September and March was largely attributable to the textile Trades,  cotton and wool between then accounting for 82% of that improvement.    Most of the improvement in those industries seems to  have  been  due to the depreciation of sterling following our departure from the Gold Standard and,  in the case of cotton,  to the trouble between Japan and China.   Although, as already stated,  the increase in unemployment in cotton during the past month nay be  largely due to extended Whitsuntide holidays, the absence  of a  substantial volume of new orders makes it very unsafe to  count upon an early return to the pre-Whitsun activity or even the maintenance of the present volume of employment.   Moreover since her departure from the Gold Standard Japan has once again become an important competitor in the foreign trade.   Some of the increased unemployment in wool is also seasonal, but the decline has been so sudden and rapid as to suggest that there are at work other factors, amongst which have been mentioned the comparative failure  of foreign trade to expand find an increase of stocks in this country  owing to recent over-production. 7.    But in addition to cotton and v/ool, May shewed, an increase in-^unemployment  in other branches of the textile group (hosiery and lace for example) and in a number of other industries,  such as general  engineering, the metal trades, etc. which made their contribution  towards the winter improvement in employment.   It is especially disappointing that these trades should now appear to be  going back. 8.    Employment in the seasonal trades has also proved most disappointing and the seasonal improvement in e.g.  building,  public works contracting and some of the clothing trades has been much less pronounced than usual.   In past years the relative prosperity in industries like building, public works contracting and the transport and distributive trades has helped to offset the depression in other industries.   But this year unemployment amongst insured workpeople in  building is 75,000 higher than a year ago, in public works
                                                            O09                                                            k) (J ocontracting 45,000 higher, in the distributive trades 25,000higher and in the transport trades over 20,000 higher.    Incertain of the seasonal trades seasonal activity should now he at its height, and it would &quot;be unwise to look for any appreciable further improvement this year in the seasonaltrades as a whole.0.   In the light of these considerations, and unless someameliorative factors arise at an early date,  I very much fear that we have to look forward to progressively increasing unemployment during the remainder of this year, although the deterioration may not be very considerable (indeed there maybe a slight improvement) during the next month or two.    Ishould not like to hazard a guess at the figure to whichunemployment may trise by Christmas, but there can be no prospectnow of our realising during the present financial year theaverage of 2,400,000 which was selected by the Treasury as thebasis for the estimates.10.  It would be  idle to pretend to see in our domestic situationany basis for expecting a further early improvement in theunemployment situation.   Reports which I have received in thelast few days from my Divisional Controllers are gloomy in theextreme and indicate an increasing loss of public confidence inan early revival  of trade.   It is perhaps early yet  to expect any considerable  results from the present import duties, but although they have undoubtedly assisted already some  of thesmaller and lighter trades  such as cycles,, gloves, glass and small metal and  electrical  trades, they have not had  anyperceptible effect upon the heavier and more important trades.I understand that imports of iron and  steel into South Walesports have not decreased  as anticipated,  and foreign  sheets andbars are still being sold some way below  the price of the Britishproduct.   In so  far as the import duties succeed in  diminishingimports they also have  the&apos;  effect of reducing  employment incertain classes  of the  transport trades.   With regard to theheavy  staple industries of  any magnitude  the import duties can                                5.
probably only be expected, to assist iron and steel and perhapsgeneral engineering.   Coal, where there ore now about 340,000unemployed, can. hard3.y be assisted except in so far as an expansion in the other heavy industries induces a larger demandfor coal-.   The import trade in cotton and wool and seme of theother textiles is practically at a standstill and no further assistance to those industries can therefore be expected fromthe import duties.   The new Industries which are being started by foreign or British firms owing to the protection afforded, bytariffs or by depreciation of sterling can at most give employ-men t to a few thousands of persons - mainly women and juveniles.The latest estimates put the employment provided by new factoriesalready in production at not more than 10,000 and the prospectiveemployment of the same factories when in full production is not likely to be more than 25,000.   An improvement in the baildingIndustry and the distributive trades and the hotel etc. service(which between them account for over 500,000 of the unemployedinsured workpeople) is dependent upon a relaxation of the existingpublic and private financial stringency - in other words upon ageneral revival of industrial activity.   So far as the distribu-tive trades are concerned it is impossible as one goes about toavoid the impression that people are spending progressively farless than they have been accustomed to spend&apos;in the last fewyears or even months, end moreover are tending to buy lower-priced articles-   The Board of Trade index of retail sales forthe months February to April showed a fall of 4,3 per cent comparedwith the same months last year.   There is evidence that,  in an endeavour to induce purchases, margins of profit have been cutvery fine, and this in turn has had its effect on employment owingto the necessity of paying increased attention to overhead charges.11o  Although the balance of cur foreign trade shews an improve-aent in recent months this should not be allowed to obscure thefact that our foreign trade has fallen to a definitely lower
level.    This is even more evident in the case of the chiefforeign countries.   So far as I can estimate from publishedfigures the foreign trade of the U..S.A. for the first four months of this year compared with the corresponding periodlast year shew decreases of 30 per cent in the case of imports and 35 per cent in the case of exports.   For France comparing the same period there were decreases of 34 per cent in imports and 29 per cent in exports;  and for Germany decreases of 58per cent in imports and 29 per cent in exports.   Many othercountries, especially the debtor countries of Central and SouthEastern Europe, shew similar heavy declines in foreign trade,12o  I am driven to the conclusion that the main hope of avoidingadditional heavy unemployment in this country during the coming winter lies in the removal of the restrictions which arestrangling international trade..   It would be going beyond myprovince to attemp to indicate what measures should be taken with that object,  but I feel that my colleagues should have before them an appreciation of the employment situation and aknowledge of the probability that in the absence of a substantialrecovery in the trade of the world 7;e shall be faced with a volumof unemployment next winter greater&apos; than anything we have experienced previously-                                    (Intd.)  H, B-5th Jims, 1932.
