I. INTRODUCTORY.    THE  Cabinet, at their Meeting on the 4th May, 1932 (Cabinet 26 (32),Conclusion 2), after a discussion on Air Disarmament, decided          That the Coast Defence Sub-Committee  should be invited to consider,    more particularly from the point of view- of the defence against air attack of    London and  other possible objectives in the  United Kingdom, the various    proposals that had been made for Air disarmament, and to make recom-    mendations to the Cabinet as to the policy of the United Kingdom Delegation..    2.  Our Meeting on the 6th May was attended by the Secretary of State  forForeign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Air, and the Chief of the Air Staffgave us valuable information on the technical aspects of the question.  We had before us not only the detailed  proposals for Air  disarmament policy that were put forward at the Cabinet,  but  also a number of proposals that have been presented officially at Geneva and which are summarised in the Appendix.   Mostof these latter proposals have  already  formed the subject of Cabinet decisions.We did not discuss in detail the wider suggestions made to the Cabinet by  theLord  President of the Council, which appear to us more suitable for discussion by the Cabinet as a whole.  We therefore concentrated our attention mainly onthe following two suggestions that were mentioned  at the Cabinet:      (a) The prohibition of the  act of bombing on the territory and shipping of           another sovereign State.    (b) &quot;The abolition of big bombing aircraft.We will deal with each of these, in turn.            49Copy No.   ^*&apos;wII. EFFECT OF THE PROPOSED PROHIBITION OF BOMBING ON IMPERIAL DEFENCE.    3.  The Chief of the Air Staff urges weighty objections against the proposalto prohibit the act of bombing on the territory and snipping of another sovereign state.   The more important objections arise  in connection with the defence ofLondon, but there are  not inconsiderable objections from the point of  view of empire defence as a whole, and to these we will first turn.

     4.   On the North-West Frontier of  India we should, in theory at any rate-(but see below, paragraph 8), still be able to use bombing aircraft for  the main-tenance of order within the boundaries of India.  In the event,  however,  of a repetition by Afghanistan of the invasion of  India, as attempted in  1919, we-should only be able to bomb the invaders after they had crossed the frontier.  Ifthe, proposal under consideration were adopted by the Disarmament Conferencewe should have  debarred ourselves from bombing  the  enemy&apos;s Capital, or hisconcentrations, or troops  on  the march,  or  supply depots  beyond the  frontiers of India.   The line of argument in paragraphs 4 and 5 is developed in greater detail in a telegram from the Government of India recently  circulated to theCabinet by the Secretary of State for India (Paper No. CP. 126 (32)).     5.   The plans approved  by the  Committee of Imperial  Defence for  thedefence of India against invasion by Russia allot an important role to the RoyalAir Force in Afghanistan, especially  in the early stages of a war  before contactcould be established between the main armies.   If the proposal now under con-sideration were carried out we should be deprived of that important element inour plans.     6.   Within the borders of Iraq,  as on the North-West Frontier, we should still, in theory,  have the  right to maintain order by the use of air forces, withbombing  as the last resort.   Iraq, however, has been exposed  from the first to serious raids across its southern borders.  For the defence of the long southernfrontier we have hitherto relied on the Royal Air Force, which has not hesitated,when in hot pursuit, to attack marauders in their retreat into Arabia.   without this right the Royal Air Force  will be very seriously handicapped in this vastterritory.  Similarly, in the hinterland of Aden the Royal Air Force have fromtime to time  found it  indispensable, in  the exercise of its  responsibilities for&quot;frontier defence, to attack forts in the territory of the Imam of the Yemen.  Theproposal under consideration would deprive us of the right to take such action.     7.   We do not wish  to anticipate our Report on Coast Defences, which we hope to circulate in the near future, but  we think there is&quot; force in the Chief ofthe Air Staffs claim that it would be a serious disadvantage if air forces at or within reach  of  Singapore and other coast defences at home  and abroad  weredeprived of the right of attacking ships with bombs and torpedoes.     8.   We think, also, that the Chief of the Air Staff is right in his contention that  the prohibition  of  bombing on the territory  and  snipping of anothersovereign State would, before long, result in an overwhelming  demand through-out the East that bombing should not be  employed for the maintenance of order.We are impressed by  Sir John Salmond&apos;s  statement  that  one  of the IndianDelegates at Geneva had  told him that the adoption of such a rule would leadto a strong demand by  the Indian Legislative Assembly for the application of  asimilar rule in all parts  of India.    We do not believe it would be possible tomaintain for long one rule in international warfare and another in operations forthe maintenance of order.*III. EFFECT OF THE PROPOSED RESTRICTION OF BOMBING  ON HOME  DEFENCE.     9.   At first  sight we  expected to find that the security of  London would beincreased by a proposal  to  prohibit bombing on the territory and shipping of another sovereign State.  That undoubtedly would be  the case  if we could be certain that the rule would be observed in time of war.   Again and again,  how-ever\ the so-called laws of war have broken down under the test of actual warfare,and never more conspicuously than in the Great War.   Within a  few months ofits outbreak many conventions bearing on the conduct of naval  warfare had been broken, t and the unratified  Declaration  of  London, to which the British  andFrench  Governments had announced  adherence in  August 1914,  was graduallywhittled away and finally repudiated on the 7th July, 1916.   When desperatelyseeking a counter to the Zeppelin we deliberately decided to utilise a weapon (the....  * See also CP. 126 (32), paragraph 11 ;  i-Our honourable colleague, Sir Fazl-I-Husain, is unable to subscribe to the distinction we have drawn between States and border tribes and  between bombing opentowns and villages of the Indian frontier, especially on the ground that border tribes have no standingarmy, no aircraft, no cannons, no batteries, and their only firearm is a rifle.&quot;    f See O.I.D. Paper B.R. 13.                                               ;y.
explosive  and  incendiary  bullet) which,  along with  other  nations, we hadsolemnly forsworn in the Declaration of St.  Petersburg.   Moreover,  bombing,even if prohibited, could always be resorted to as an act of reprisals against some-real or imagined breach of the laws of war.   With great reluctance we feel boundto admit that in the overwhelming stress of a  war which threatens the life of a nation no reliance can be placed on the observance of artificial laws of war.  Ifa nation was convinced that bombing might make the difference  between  victoryand defeat, between a short war and a long war, some pretext would be found to resort to it.    10.  If   the  protection  of  London  and  the  other  considerable,  if  less important, centres within range of attack from the Continent of Europe cannotbe entrusted  to a law of  war, we have to consider whether the rule that is nowproposed would render these objectives more secure or less so than at present.    11.  The defence of London against air attack may be considered under three-distinct heads:         (a)  Active defence by aircraft;        (b)  Semi-active defence by aircraft guns;        (c)  Passive defence by the civil population.    The active defence  is intended  to be provided by a home defence force of52 squadrons as a minimum, of which 13 fighter and 28 bombing squadrons havebeen provided, leaving 7 bombing and 4 fighter squadrons still to be formed.    The semi-active defence  is to consist of 11  anti-aircraft brigades of RoyalArtillery, and 7 battalions of Royal Engineers, searchlights, sound lticaters, &amp;c,for the defence of the area south and east of a line drawn  from Portland to theWash.   There is, in addition, an observer corps of special  constables.   Thisscheme, like the active defence by aircraft, is far from complete.    12.  Even when the complete scheme of defence has been organised, Londonwill be by no means immune from attack, owing to the vast cubic air space to be defended and the high speed and power of modern aircraft.  In fact, the arrange-ments for the passive defence of the civil population are based  on the assumptionthat a potential enemy from the  Continent might bomb London on the  following-scale :         100  tons of bombs in the first 24 hours;        75  tons of bombs in the second 24 hours;        50  tons of bombs in  the third and subsequent 24 hours, for an indefinite-             period ;and it is estimated that one week&apos;s bombing on this scale will involve the followingcasualties :-                      6,375 killed;                     12,375 wounded;               Total 18,750 casualties.    13.  If  the proposed prohibition of bombing were to be adopted, the result,.it is represented to us by the Chief of the Air Staff, would be that we should notbe able to justify the maintenance of  our present Home Defence Forces.  however much we might mistrust the observance under the stress of war of the. undertaking to abstain from bombing, we could hardly justify to the League of Nations, or toParliament,  the maintenance of  a force whose only raison d&apos;etre  is to defend usagainst bombing attack, and whose principal means of defence is counter-bombing,as we show later in paragraph 15.  Apart from the Fleet Air Arm, which has itsown functions, the utmost that we could justify, in the view of the Chief of the AirStaff, would be the increase of the machines for the Army co-operation squadronsfrom the present figure of 60 to 150.  It would also be difficult to justify our semi-active defences, or our carefully-built-up ground organisation  (aerodromes, &amp;c).   - 14.  Continental nations, with conscript armies, could justify a far higher figure.  France, for example, could claim 1,021  aircraft for Army  co-operationpurposes.   The existing French Army co-operation machines are each capable ofcarrying 400 lbs. of bombs and their pilots are trained to use them.  Coming to civil transport aviation, we have 35 civil aircraft to France&apos;s 269.  In addition,however, there is nothing in the proposed rule to prevent France from maintaining a large force of bombing aircraft in her African possessions, &quot;for the maintenance       [6970]                                                    B 2
of order, in imitation of our example in Iraq.  Whereas our bombing aircraftmaintained  for similar purposes would be scattered  throughout the  East from egypt to India, France&apos;s corresponding machines would be within flying distance of the Mother country, where they could be used to reinforce the squadrons already:available for the attack on London and other  important objectives in  Englandwithin their range.  If this rule were adopted, therefore, the figures for the twocountries would be as follows :                                                United                                              Kingdom.     France.          Military  aircraft       ...      ...    150        1,021          Civil aircraft   ...       ...      ...     35          269                 Total    ...       ...       ..    185        1,290                                                       Plus additional                                                       squadrons  from                                                           Africa.    The Chief of the  Air Staff estimates that without  the additional Africanforces the French could drop on London bombs to the amount of 210 tons a day.    15.  The disadvantage from which we should suffer cannot be measured solely by the numerical disparity of the respective forces.  For reasons which  were givento us in detail by the Chief of the Air Staff, it is impossible to provide an effectivedefence of London by Fighter Squadrons only.   The  plan drawn up  by the AirMinistry, and approved by the three Services and the Committee of ImperialDefence, therefore, envisages  a strong counter-attack against  aerodromes andother objectives  in the enemy&apos;s country; and for this reason a  high  proportionof our defence force consists of Bombing Squadrons.  If  our forces were limited in the manner contemplated, we could no longer base our arrangements  on thewell-established  principle that attack  is the best form of defence.    With suchheavy odds against them, the moral of the defenders  could not stand it, and,  inaddition, there would certainly be a strong public demand, as there  was  in thelate War, for concentration of a visible local defence, which, we are advised, wouldnot be in the least effective.    16.  One  result of the great reduction in forces contemplated would be afurther restriction in our aircraft industry, which is  already greatly  inferior  tothat of France.  There would be no prospect of  an expansion during a war whichwould enable us to overtake the superiority of our supposed enemy in this respect.    17.  As shown  in paragraph 12, even when the full air defence force hasbeen provided, London will  still be  liable to a most formidable scale  of air bombardment.  But  if the rule now proposed were adopted, this scale would  bedoubled, and there would be no prospect, as there is at present, of our being ableto reduce it as  the  war progressed.   London would soon be  at the mercy  ofthe enemy.    18.  The  rule would,  of course, confer some advantage if we could be sure that no preparations would be made in time of peace for bombing in time of war.In that event we could count on a few weeks of immunity at the outset of a warwhile bombs and other technical appliances were being  manufactured; and weare advised  that this would be of great advantage from the point of view of thescheme  of Air Raids Precautions, one of the  main  difficulties  of  which is thepossible suddenness of an attack on the maximum scale. Under the rule proposed,however, we are not satisfied that this would be the case.  A nation is permitted to bomb within its own frontiers.   The French, therefore, who are always muchpreoccupied with the  defence of their eastern frontier, would be justified  in maintaining bombing  machines, with all  the  necessary  paraphernalia, for use against an enemy that had crossed their frontier as  in  1914.   In case of needthese could be used against this country.  We ourselves would not have the samejustification for providing bombing aircraft, since the threat of oversea invasionhas come to be regarded  as  remote  under modern conditions.*   Furthermore,bombers from Africa might provide the French with  a useful nucleus of trainedbombers practically  from the outbreak of war.    * It is perhaps worth noting&apos; that ttie existence of a Home Defence Air Force is one of the factorsthat were taken into account in estimating&apos; the present low scale of oversea attack. M.L5.A.H.
    19.  We feel some doubt as to whether Continental nations could accept a restriction on bombing which  was so artificial as to permit them to bomb  anenemy only after he had crossed  their frontiers  and  did  not allow them  to retaliate against  his aerodromes,  railway junctions,  depots  and  places  of concentration across the frontier.   This reinforces the probability that any suchrule would be broken at an early stage of a war.    20.  On a review of the above considerations, we are forced to the conclusionthat the proposed rule of war  would not result in making London more secure,but, on the contrary, would produce results that would be dangerous to its defence.We are  conscious that, in pursuit of a policy of peace and disarmament, wecannot be guided solely by technical considerations of defence.   The objections,however, presented to us  by the Chief of the Air Staff, and summarised above,are so overwhelming that  we could  not recommend that our Delegates at Genevashould take the initiative  in proposing any such rule of war.     IV. THE  PROPOSED RESTRICTION ON THE SIZE  OF BOMBING AIRCRAFT.      21.   The Air Ministry&apos;s proposal is the abolition of big bombing aircraft.  They propose  to limit aircraft to a  maximum  unloaded weight of 11,000 lbs.  (i.e., without petrol, oil, bombs, machine guns, ammunition and crew.)      22.   We cannot conceal that this proposal is  also  open to the  criticism  that, as illustrated by the &quot;Pocket Battleship,&quot;  the  advance of science will find  the means of rendering the  smaller aircraft more formidable  than they are  at  present,  either  by  increasing their capacity or  the  deadliness of  the weapons-  they carry.   This, however, is a form of criticism which was used by M. Tardieu  against the principle of qualitative disarmament, and must not, in our opinion,  be accepted  as  a bar to its  adoption.   The Air Ministry&apos;s proposal would, we  believe, prove  an advantage in limiting  the  size of  the bombs that  could  be  dropped,  and in checking a  competition in the size of aircraft comparable with  that which  grew up as to capital ships until it was  checked by the Washington  Treaty.   It would also result in some economy.   The proposal also is on all fours  with the  proposals we have  already made for  limiting the size of capital ships,  guns and tanks.      23.   We therefore recommend that the United  Kingdom Delegation should  be authorised to propose the limitation of aircraft (other than civil aircraft)  to  a maximum unloaded weight  of  11,000  lbs.  As  we understand that it  is  impossible to define a bombing aircraft we recommend that, to be  effective, the  limitation must apply to all aircraft other than civilian aircraft.*                           V. OTHER PROPOSALS.    24.  The only other proposal to which we have given consideration is onesupported  by several  Delegations, including  those of  Japan  and the UnitedStates of America, for the prohibition of bombardment from the air of the civilpopulation.  This is a matter of considerable difficulty.   Factories, for example,engaged in the  manufacture of arms, ammunition and other military supplies,and towns  and villages on the lines of communication used for military purposes and other  military objectives are usually  so situated  that the attempt to bombthem  is bound to involve casualties to the civil population.  We were informed by the Chief of the Air Staff that accuracy of aim has improved so much thaton the  North-West Frontier of India  aircraft are able to bomb a house  of aparticular  sheikh.  Nevertheless, we think that under war conditions such refine-ments would be  difficult to observe.   * It  is understood  that the Technical Air Committee at Geneva proposes to deal separately withflying- boats, and we suggest that the United Kingdom Delegation  be allowed some latitude in  thismatter.
                  VI. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS.25.   Our recommendations to the Cabinet may be summed up as follows :  (i)  The proposed  prohibition of the act of bombing on the territory and      shipping of another  sovereign  State  possesses considerable disad-      vantages from  the point of view of  imperial defence generally, and      decisive disadvantages from that of the defence of London and  other      objectives to  air attack  in  the United Kingdom.   We do not      recommend that the United Kingdom Delegation at the Disarmament      Conference  should be  authorised to make this proposal;(ii)  We recommend that the United Kingdom Delegation at Geneva should      be authorised to propose the restriction of aircraft, other than civilian      aircraft, to the weight proposed by the Chief of the Air Staff, namely,      11,000 pounds  unloaded weight, as  specified in paragraph 21, and      footnote  to  paragraph 23.

APPENDIX.                        PROPOSALS  MADE AT GENEVA.   .    PROPOSALS  which have been put  forward officially at Geneva  may besummarised as follows :       (i) Total abolition of military  aviation           This proposal has been put forward by the German, Danish, Spanish,              Swedish, Turkish and Hejazi Delegations.     (ii) The abolition  of bombing aeroplanes.           This proposal has been put forward by the Italian, Swiss, Hungarian,              Chinese, Belgian,  Portuguese and Soviet Delegations.     (iii) The prohibition of bombardment from the air of the civil population.           This  proposal has  been advocated  by the  Czecho-Slovak, Haitian,              Japanese,   Netherlands,   Roumanian   and   United   States              Delegations.     (iv) The complete surrender to  the League of all heavy bombing aircraft;              medium  bombing aircraft to be held by the country to which they              belong solely on condition  that they are available for service by              the League whenever requested;  small  bombing aircraft only to              belong unconditionally to the State.           This  proposal has been put  forward by the French Delegation and              has  been coupled with the proposal for the  internationalisation              of civil aviation.     (v) Internationalisation or strict  control  of civil aviation.           In addition to France, this proposal has been advocated by Belgium,              Spain, Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland.     (vi) Restrictions to ensure that civil aircraft cannot be used for military              purposes.           Proposals  under this  heading  have  been  made by Germany and              Russia.    (vii) Abolition  or reduction in tonnage of aircraft-carriers.           Proposals under this heading have been submitted by China, Germany,              Italy,  Russia and Japan.o
