IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS. BRTTAN1TXC MAJESTY^S GOVERNMEM1) .7l70(3&amp;) .COPY No.  cabinet,       Railway Pooling Agreement.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Transport -   for the information of the Cabinet.         The London, midland ana Scottish and London and NorthEastern Railway Companies have recently submitted for myconsent, in accordance with the provisions of the Railv/aysAct, 1921, an Agreement into which they have entered for the pooling of receipts from rail borne traffic between pointswhere the two companies are in competition with each other.The pool will apply to passenger, goods and mineral traffic,and will cover from 50 to 55 per cent, of the gross railwayreceipts of the two companies.         Section 19 of the Railways Act, 1921, under which myconsent is required to an Agreement between any twoAmalgamated Companies for the pooling of receipts, providesthat before giving consent I shall,, unless it appears ts methat the matter is one of such small importance that it is unnecessary to do so, refer the matter for consideration andreport to a Committee selected from the panel set up underSection 23 of the Ministry of Transport Act, as extended bySection 80 of the Railways Act, 1921.         In view of the importance of the matter I have appointed the three permanent members of the Railway rates tribunal, namely, Sir Walter Clode, K.C. (President) andMr. J. Quirey and Mr. H.E. Parkes (appointed respectively aspersons of experience in railway business and in commercialaffairs) to constitute the Committee which is to consider this proposal and to report to me upon it.   Their experienceon the Railway Rates Tribunal ensures that they will approach
                      - 2 -the question with an intimate knowledge of railway transport,and at the same time in the necessary judicial spirit.bhile there may he some aemand for representation ofparticular interests I am satisfied that it would he unwise to accede to it and I believe that the appointment of themembers of the Railway Rates Tribunal will be generally approved.   The Committee will no aoubt hold a public hearingat which all parties concerned will have an opportunity ofstating their views.   It will be appreciated that theCommittee has been appointed under a statutory direction;but that the decision of the matter rests not with theCommittee, who will act merely in an advisory capacity, but with the Minister, who is free to exercise his discretionafter considering their report.                              (Intld.)  P.J.P.27th May, 1932.
