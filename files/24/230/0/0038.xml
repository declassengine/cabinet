THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROFJRTY OS? HIS BRITANNIC UAJJSTY^ GOVERNMENT.REGRET,Copy No.9CABINET.Trade with Russia.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trado     I circulate to my colleagues a statement showing the valueof the trade between this country and Russia during each monthsince January, 1931.  There has been during each month of thisyear a steadily decreasing excess of imports from over exportsto Russia, and in April for the first time exports to Russia were greater than imports.  During the first four months of last yearimports exceeded exports by  5,017,000 and this excess was reducedto .3517,000 for the first four months of this year.  The reductionin the visible adverse balance is due both to a diminution in thevalue of imports and to an increaoe in the value of domesticexports.     The reduction of over  3 million in the value of imports isdue to the practical cessation of wheat shipments from Russia, andto reduced imports of timber and petroleum.  The value of thewheat imported up to the end of April was nearly  l  million lessthan in the corresponding period of last year, and it seemspractically certain that imports of Russian wheat will be negligible until the new crop becomes available in the autumn.     Domestic exports during the first four months of this yearamounted in value to  3,691,000, an increase of  1,653,000 ascompared with January - April, 1931.  Of the total value of the exports this year exports of machinery represented more than  2^million.  The chief item in this was machine tools ( 1,165,000)while other large items were electrical machinery ( 315,000),cranes, hoists, etc.  280,000) and boilers and boiler house plant 264,000).     The increase in exports was mainly due  to  the  additional facilities given under the Export Credits GuaranteeScheme following the arrangements made last  July
   between the Soviet Authorities and the then Lord Privy Seal   (Mr. Johnston) whereby payment for heavy engineering products   to the value of  6 million was to be guaranteed, provided that   the credit period did not in any case exceed thirty months   from the placing of the orders.        Prom the beginning of 1931 up to the end of March, 1932,   contracts valued at  9,530,000 have been made between the   Sxport Credits Guarantee Department and exporters of goods to   Russia.   These contracts are made at the time when orders are   placed, and as the relative goods are exported some months   later, we may take for comparison with the above figure the   shipments made from the beginning of April, 1931.  The value of   such shipments during the twelve months ended March, 1932, was    6,790,000.  The difference between the two figures, viz.,    2,740,000 may be taken as representing the minimum value of   the contracts at present outstanding.  The amount may be   appreciably more than this, since in the case of heavy   machinery the interval between the time when orders are placed   and the goods are exported may be as much as six or nine months.        The probability is that by the end of June little will   remain to be exported of the  6 million programme.  Thereafter,   exports with Export Credits guarantee may be expected to fall   off considerably, since the amount of credits which the   Department has contracted to cover since that programme was   completed is on a much smaller scale.  These credits amounted   up to 21st May to  700,000.  If to this be added the    1,600,000 which is now being guaranteed under the recent   Cabinet authority, it is evident that the maximum amount of   fresh business contracted for in 1932 is likely to fall consider-   ably short of the corresponding figure for 1931.  Consequently, t   exports after the end of June, are likely to be much less than   in the first part of this year.                                         W.R. of Trade,th June, 1932.
