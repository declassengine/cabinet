INDIA&apos;         Appreciation of the Political Situation bythe Government of India, dated 20th May 1932.         Circulated for the information of the Cabinetby the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential appreciation of the Political Situationin India, dated 20th May, 1932,  issued on theauthority of the Secretary of State  for India.     When the last appreciation v/as written,  there  was some danger of trouble in the Worth West Frontier Provincearising out of interference with the elections  andthreatened disturbance during the Viceroy&apos;s visit.   the trouble was threatened from two tahsils only of thePeshawar District, and it was necessary to takenrecautions against the incursions of demonstrators fromthese areas; these were completely successful and  the inauguration of the new constitution and other ceremoniespassed off without a hitch.   Peshawar City itself  gaveno sign of trouble, and the Province generally, with theexception of the areas mentioned, appears to have  taken  a genuine interest in the new order, the situation havingbeen practically normal both in the settled districts and tribal areas during the past month.     Eeports regarding interference with the elections inOharsadda and Mardan show, however, that the Bed-Shirtmovement&apos; is still a source of danger in these areas.  Thedemonstrations were well organised, and evidently  had thesupport of a considerable section of the population.  Tosome extent, the people were deliberately misled by thereport that the object of the Government was to securevotes in favour of the execution of Abdul Ghaffar  Khan,  whois being held as a State prisoner; but, even when allowance is made for the effect of this rumour among anignorant and fanatical people, it appears clear that behind the demonstrations v/as a good deal of support for  the Red-Shirt movement as such.  Little violence or indeed                                              resentment
resentment appears to have been shown against Governmentofficers including military and police, but many of thosewho attempted to record their votes were ill-treated,grossoutrages being committed in a few cases.  The result hasbeen a revulsion of feeling against the Bed-Shirts amongmany who were inclined to sympathise with them andespecially among the intelligentsia.     The attempt to hold the annual session of Congress atDelhi v/as a fiasco and failed completely in its main object,namely, the raising of the prestige of that body.  the nearest approach to an open session v/as a hurriedcollection in twos and threes of a couple of hundredpersons who evaded the vigilance of the police, &quot;passedunanimously&quot; 5 resolutions which were gabbled out by oneof their number.  The proceedings lasted less than 5 minuteswhen the police quietly arrested all the participants.For several days there was considerable excitement in Delhi,and a great strain v/as placed on the police, especially onthe date fixed for the session.  Under the direction of thelocal authorities, they acted with excellent judgment andrestraint, and no untoward incident occurred.  A largenumber of arrests were made in Delhi itself, and a fairnumber of persons who attempted to attend the session were arrested in other Provinces.  The great majority have been released, since the object of the Government was to preventthe session of Congress, and not to send a number ofpersons to jail,     A very satisfactory feature is the quick return to normal conditions in Delhi itself, which has been unusuallyquiet since the session.  This is the more gratifyingsince attempts were made to embroil the Sikhs in Congressagitation.  These originated in the Punjab, and. attained                                                      some
some measure of success, in that the extremist  Sikh body,while not openly joining the Civil Disobedience Movement,gave permission to their followers to do so.   special efforts were made to send bands of Sikhs to the Congresssession and several hundreds had to be put under arrest.A later attempt was made to stage a demonstration on the6th May, the anniversary of an incident that  occurred during the Civil Disobedience Movement of 1930.  In thecourse of the riots that occurred in Delhi on the arrest  of gandhi in May, 1930, the police had to fire on Sikhs whowere attacking them from a well-known shrine.  The affaircaused considerable excitement generally among Sikhs atthe time, and was a source of anxiety to the Government.Congress endeavoured this year to revive the Sikh feelingon the subject by a demonstration which might well have led to clashes with the police, but  this also fell fiatowing largely to the attitude of Sikh residents of Delhiwho do not desire trouble.  At the moment, therefore, theSikh position is better than it threatened to be a fewweeks ago, but it remains affected by constitutional issues.The appreciation of the situation by  the Punjab Governmentis as follows:-  &quot;the Sikhs view with much concern the solidarity of the Muhammadan deaiand  for statutory majority in the Punjab, and are apprehensive of their lot under theforthcoming announcement of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the communal question.  They are, therefore, anxious to stagesuch a demonstration as will reveal  their importance as a community as soon as possible.  The Hindus are equallyanxious to enlist Sikhs on their side before the expiry ofthe Ordinances early in July&quot;.  It is added that the rank and file are&apos;generally apathetic about joining the CivilDisobedience Movement.                                                    In
        In most provinces there has  been a marked lullin civil  Disobedience activities following the  special efforts made during National Week,  and it would appear  that congress are now experiencing difficulty in  finding devicesby which to rekindle enthusiasm.   A Postal  Week wascharacterised by destruction of letters in post boxes,sulphuric acid being generally used.   This  was done  invarious places all over India and,  although  Congress  havedisclaimed their responsibility for these activities  and damage has not been great, considerable indignation hasbeen roused against them.  Several provinces report that a feature of the general campaign at present   is  the  issueof propaganda leaflets which, in some cases, are beingdistributed in villages.  This is very difficult to counterand the extent of such activities shows that Congress arestill able to call on number of active workers.  The effectso far, does  not appear  to be appreciable and the countrysidegenerally remains quiet.  Mrs. Naidu, who had succeeded atthe end of March to  the  Acting Presidentship of the working committee, a body which  was declared unlawful at the verybeginning of the Civil Disobedience Movement, had  infused,temporarily a  good deal  of  life  into Congress  activitiesparticularly  in connection with  National week  and  the  attemptto hold  the session  of  Congress.  With her  arrest  andsentence  last  month  this temporary  stimulus has been with-drawn.         Boycott of British goods continues  as  the  main and certainly the  most popular item of the programme.. As                                                     part
part of the civil  Disobedience Movement  there are indications that it is losing ground, but the  position  is obscured.by the growth of the Movement in favour  of  Indian goods;various leagues have been formed in different parts of  thecountry in support of Indian commodities and, while some ofthem are divorced from politics and genuinely interested in economic progress, there is reason to  believe that many merelyrepresent the Congress programme under another name.  Thepolicy of the Gocernment is not to penalise activities  whichare pursued not in furtherance of the  Civil disobedience movement, but in the promotion of Indian industries and byconstitutional means.   But, at the same time,  they take theview that activities carried on in furtherance  of  the CivilDisobedience Movement cannot be regarded as legitimate, merely because they take the form of advocacy of Indian goods.Action against an association is, therefore, within thepolicy of the Government, where methods  employed by it are within the mischief of the law or where  its purpose is toassist the Civil Disobedience Movenent.     Figures for convictions are of interest.  During  january the total was 15,000, this rose to 18,000 during february and dropped to 7,000 during March.   The figures for  Aprilare not complete, as those for Madras and Bengal have not  beenreceived.   It is probable that they will be between  5,500 and,000 representing a decrease of over 1,000 on the Marchfigures.  Any reduction  on the latter will be very satisfactorysince experience over many years has shown that the month ofApril is a favourite period  for agitation, and, on the present occasion, it included the intensive programme of NationalWeek session at Delhi and other activities.                                                         The
          The above remarks  suggest  that  the civil disobed-ience movement is definitely on  the  downward grade. It is,however, necessary to give a note  of warning. The Governmentof India have had occasion recently  to  consult the local governments in this connection,  and  the almost unanimousopinion is that while the movement is definitely under con-trol,  the main cause of this is that the Government took the initiative in January last and have retained it. opinion is general that the relaxation of  measures on the part ofthe Government would be immediately  followed by a seriousrecrudescence of activity on the part of  Congress, whichwould gravely prejudice the  success  achieved during thepast months.        The Muslim agitation regarding  Kashmir has subsided,at any rate for the time being,  largely owing to therecommendations of the Glancy Committee,  whose recommendations are, on the whole, in accordance with Muslim feeling.  Therehave been some reactions amon ; Hindus of  the States againstthe report of the Committee, but up  to  the present the agitation need not be regarded as  dangerous.  The  state of tension between the communities  in India  generally, is suchas to make the possibility of local  outbreaks a constantsource of anxiety, and the manner in which the most trivialincidents may result in bloodshed on a  large scale has once more been illustrated by the communal riot which broke out in bombay on the 14th and which, at the time of writing,(the 18th,)is still going on, although on a considerably reduced  scale.local authorities have been too  busy in suppressing disordersto submit detailed reports and some days  will probably elapse before the full extent of the casualties  and damage to                                                     property
property is known.    It is,  however,  already  clearthat the riot has been widespread and that  casualties have been heavy.
