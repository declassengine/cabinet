The Public Works Loans Bill is in normal circumstances      taken annually in July or August.   Its main purpose is to fix      the maximum sum which may be issued to the  Public Works      Loan Commissioners for the purpose of making loans  from the      Local Loans Fund up to the date of the passing of a further      Bill.      2,     The provision made in the Public  Works Loans Act      1931 ( 20 millions) is expected to be exhausted by  the end      of September and it is therefore necessary that a Bill      providing for further advances be taken  before the  summer      recess, and it is desired by the Whips that it should be      introduced at the earliest possible moment,   The  amount      proposed in the Bill to be issued for loans is  18  millions      v/hich is estimated to be sufficient to meet requirements      for a period of 12 months.      3.     Under Section 15 of the National Debt and Local Loans      Act 1887 the principal of any loan not likely to be recovered      is directed by Parliament to be written off from the assets      of the Local Loans Fund and to be made good ultimately by a      Vote of Parliament.   In accordance with this procedure      Clause 2 of this Bill author&apos;!ses the write off of unrecoverable      balances amounting to  5,148.17.8 in respect of a loan to the      Lyemouth Harbour Trustees under the Harbours and Passing      Tolls Act, 1861, and certain loans under the Agricultural                               -1-
Credits Act 1923.    The circumstances under which thesebalances are written off are exolained in the Schedulesappended to the memorandum printed with the Bill.4.     It is usually necessary not only to write off baddebts from the assets of the ..-&apos;und, but further to remit the debt remaining due to the &apos; exchequer as against the borrower.Glauses 3 and 4 of the Bill therefore provide for there mission of the amounts of principal written off under clause 2 together with the interest outstanding.5.     Clause 3, relating to the Eyemouth Harbour loanis self explanatory.   This clause -JJHB a regular feature of tannual Public Works Loans Bill for many years prior to 1928but in the last three years the Surplus Herring Brand feeshave been sufficient to meet the annual instalments ofprincipal and interest.    In 1931, however, they provedinsufficient, and remission is again necessary.6.     The Bill does not usually give rise to controversy in the House, but on the present occasion there may be some discussion as to the figure of .318 millions, whichcompares with  .20 millions in the Act of last September,and  30 millions in that of August 1930.       The Opposition will probably contend that  it isunduly restrictive on-^enterprise; the advocates of economy will wish to be satisfied that it is not  too generous.It is possible that a somewhat larger amount of parliamentary time may  be used than on previous occasions.    It is really neither the one nor the other.   It is based on thecurrent rate of advances, which admittedly represents adecline on the rate current a year ago.    That decline is due partly to the general tendency towards economy,  partly to thefall in prices, estimated at IQo in respect of cost of housing construction, which is equivalent  to a difference of
150 1 million in the capital requirement  for the  same numberof houses as a year ago.    In addition it is desiredto bring the maximum fig-are which Parliament is  askedto authorise into closer relation with  the estimateof requirements than has been the practice in  previous years.7,     I ask for the authority of the  Committeeto introduce the  ill immediately.

Public  Works  Loans  Bill.           FINANCIAL  MEMORANDUM.     1. Under section 15 of the National Debt and local loans Act, 1887, where the whole or any part of theprincipal of any local loan is, by reason of the sum notbeing likely to be recovered, directed by Parliament tobe written off from the Account of Assets of the local loans Fund,  the amount of that principal is required tobe  paid to the National Debt Commissioners out of moneys provided by Parliament.  Any sums afterwardsrecovered, whether for principal or interest, in respect ofthe  amount  so  written off,  are to be paid into theExchequer.     2. Clause 2 of  this Bill proposes to write off theprincipal of various loans to the extent of  5,148 17s. 8d.,and in  accordance with the procedure indicated  above this sum will  require to be  made good to  the Local loans fund by Vote.   The amount will appear in the Vote forRepayments  to the Local  Loans Fund for the financialyear 1933.     3. As there  is no prospect of effecting any furtherrecovery of the  amounts  due  from the borrowers, theprincipal written off  by clause 2 is  extinguished,  andarrears  of interest are remitted, by clauses  3 and 4 ofthe Bill.     4. Particulars of all the loans in question are given below.132-3AIPBIlllllMllinilMllllillllllMlM^                       1    111  &quot;----

It was further provided that the  portion of the &quot;Surplus Herring  Brand Fees,&quot; as defined in clause 3, of anyone year should only be applicable to the repayment of the one-fiftieth part of the principal and
BOinterest on outstanding principal falling dueunder tho security for the loan in the sameyear, and should not be  applicable to the repayment of arrears of principal.  The &quot; Surplus Herring Brand Fees &quot; of theyear ended 31st March 1932, were insufficient to discharge in full the instalment of prin-cipal with interest which  fell due under thesecurity in the same year, and the principalsum of 177?. 13s.  6d., with 36Z. 6*. 3d. for interest (together 2131.  19s. 9d.), under theterms of the Memorandum above referred to,is therefore irrecoverable.TOfcs&amp;TOCOopOrOrOasCo(B)  LOANS  BY THE PUBLIC  WORKS LOAN COMMISSIONERS UNDER  THE AGRICULTURAL CREDITS                                    ACT, 1923  (13 &amp; 14 GBO. 5. o. 34).BO -Name of Borrower.
