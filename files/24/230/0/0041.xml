Sir,         This morning I conversed for the best part of an hour    with Herr von Neurath and we are to resume our discussion to-    morrow after I have reported to the Prime Minister.  I asked    the  German Foreign Minister whether the formation of the new    Government in Germany betokened any change in Germany&apos;s    attitude to foreign affairs.  He replied that it did not; he    had  expected me to put this question and had therefore pre-    pared a written statement which he handed to me and which is    annexed.  Herr von Neurath gave some interesting information    about the circumstances of his appointment.  The suggestion    that he should become Foreign Minister had, as I understood    him, been made to him before, but he bad always declined.    On the present occasion, however, he felt bound to comply    -with the strong personal appeal of President Hindenburg.    He had been surprised to learn from the latter that the    Nazis had urged his appointment which, he understood,  was    not  intended to be a stop-gap but was mad? with the intention    of leaving foreign affairs in his hands after the German    elections.  He told me that he had stipulated that he should    himself have full responsibility in this department, and had    reached an arrangement with Chancellor von Papen on this    matter.                                                        2....His Excellency  The Rt. Hon. Sir Horace Rumbold, Bart.,                           G.C.M.G., M.V.O. ,               etc.,  etc.,  et(?.
     2c  1 Bttid tbat i Santed to take advantage of uheopportunity, and of our previous friendship, to ask himone or two questions about his conception of German foreignpolicy, the answers to which woold help us in the difficulttimes immediately  head.  In the first place, we should like to know what was the contribution which Germany feltshe could make towards European appeasement and recovery.v/e fully appreciated Germany&apos;s case on the subject of reparations and disarmament, and we realised Gormany&apos;economic difficulties.  But if Britain was to sat as&quot;honest broker&apos;1 in the impending discussions, it was neces-sary that Germany should provide something more than a listof what she wanted,  what would Germany be able to contributefrom her side?  If we wore to be useful in getting Germany&apos;scase fairly considered and provided for, it was clear thatthere must be somo mud arc quo.  Ead herr von Neurathconsidered how far Germany could go in the direction ofadhering to a political truce for a period of years?  Ilerrvon Ifeurath at once said that this pointed to the questionof the Polish Corridor, and I agreed that that would be an example.  He then said emphatically that as things were nowGerman policy did not aim at securing an alteration, but onthe other hand it was quite impossible that Germany shouldcontemplate a continuance of the existing situation forever,  I said that my query had reference to a tern of years during which there would be an agreement between european states to pursue no policy which was calculated to raisecontroversial political issues.  Such an agreement would not
ofiebe addressed to any specific question or country, but itwould be a form of assurance which might be valuable inreturn for an adjustment of the reparation and disarmamentpositions.  It was important, as it seemed to me, both asa means of meeting natural French, anxieties and as a proofto the United States that Europe was doing its utmost to preserve the peace.  And it had a further implication, inthat if Europe was able to show to America that it was making a real effort to get rid of suspicion and promoteappeasement, this might influence the attitude of theUnited States in a way which would enable America&apos;sEuropean debtors to take a more favourable view of repara-tions.  All these things were therefore connected, and Iwas most anxious to impress on him as Germany&apos;s new foreignMinister the importance which we attached to a contributionbeing made by Germany instead of Germany&apos;s attitude consist-ing solely of a demand for changes in her favour,  herr vonKeurath received these observations in very good part and said, he thoroughly appreciated the importance of this pointof view &apos; It is a matter which we will take up again in ourlater discussion.     3,  I also asked him whether he could tell me anythingof the line which he would take up when he went to Lausanne.It was one thing to go there to expound the German point ofview and to ask that it should be fully considered and alloved for in the arrangements we were trying to reach;  it was quite another thing to go there and announce a unilateraldecision on the part of Germany without any effort tonegotiate.  Herr von Keurath assured me that he had no                                               intention
intention of going to Lausanne to bang his fist on the table, and that the first of the two methods I had sketchedwas the one that Germany would follow.  His examinationduring the last few days in Berlin of the German position had satisfied him that it really was Quite impossible for germany to undertake any payment of reparations henceforward.I referred to Dr. Bruning?s last public statement and askedwhether Herr von Meurath would be mailing any public declara-tion on his own account before going to Lausanne.  He told me that he did not intend to do so, and I said I was very glad to hear it.  *fe should go there with a determination to seek agreement by every possible means, but prematuredeclarations only made things more difficult.     4.  In referring to Germany&apos;s internal affairs, Herrvon Neurath scouted as ridiculous the rumours about aHohenzollern restoration and the like.  Yon Pap en, he saidsaid, had been nominated as Chancellor because he was him-self a member of Dr. Brlining&apos;s party and it was thoughtthat this would be approved by the Nationalists; unfortunate-ly this had not turned out so well as expectedo  Of someof his other colleagues, the Foreign Minister spoke most   )highly, and the general impression he sought to convey wasthat they were not at all likely to take an extreme line andmight be depended upon to be reasonable.  I said that we were very glad indeed that he had become foreign Minister, thoughsorry to lose him from London.  He knew the sentiment of britain and the attitude of the British Government very well,and I hoped that this would serve him in good stead and enablus to get in close contact during the anxious time before us.,                          I am, etc.                            (Signed) JOHN SIMON.
            AIDS MEMOIKE.     The present German Government obviously cannot take any other point of view with regard tothe question of reparations than that which theformer Government have on repeated, occasions public-ly stated and which they have submitted to theGovernments of the creditor countries in the courseof diplomatic conversations.  The issue is not whatGermany wants or does not want, but how to draw the only possible conclusion from the existingfacts. The former German Government at the timespared no effort to bring about the lausanne conference at the earliest possible date;  the attempt to have the Conference convened in Januaryor February failed however.  The efforts of theGerman Government to prepare the present lausanne conference with Prance and the other Powers con-cerned have equally not led to any result,becauseof the change of Government in Prance; for thesame reason the French suggestion of preparing the Conference by confidential conversations between two reparation experts from each partyconcerned was dropped again at a later stage.This threatens to lead to the dangerous position that the Governments concerned are going to aConference - more important than any other                                       Conference,0 c
C&apos;t O ni-J 0 !(           -2-Conference of past years, and on the resultof which the fate of many nations and theeconomic structure of the world-depends -without having previously been in touch with one another and without a previous measure ofagreement.  Under these circumstances theGerman Government regard it as their duty to  -convey their views to the other governments before the Conference meets.     The Lausanne Conference has a negativeand a positive object.     The negative task implies the final llcui-datioh of the Reparation issue. Since the london conference on the Hoover Plan,  since the Reportsof the Basle Committee and of the SpecialAdvisory Committee of the Young Plan, economic,financial and social conditions have taken a dangerous turn for the worse in nearly all states,  A number of states is faced witheconomic5 financial and social collapse. At thejLondon Conference and in the discussions beforethe Committees mentioned above, the generalReparation issue was still the central problem;the development in the meantime has reduced thereparation issue to a part problem of secondaryimportance within the frame work cf the generalworld problem of economic and financial                        re-construct!on.,....
                  -3rre-construction.  The  Government are, therefore,faced with new  problems  of a general  characterreaching far  beyond reparations and interstatedebts.     The German Government have to lace the  factthat it has become doubtful if it will be  possibleto continue the transfer of the interest - and sinking - fund.charges on German bonds in  the hand.::of private^holders, abroad. The heichsbankss  holding of gold and foreign exchange has shrunk to amcst dangerous  low level. The German  Government-cannot allow  the remaining amount to  shrink  to nothing, but  must retain a certain amount  as last reserve  in order  to provide for  the import-ation of the  necessary food-stuffs and raw material from abroad for the German people. Now that  allother sources of foreign exchange have dried upthe service of  interest  - and sinking - fund charges for the private foreign  debts has to  rely  exclusively on the export surplus. In 1932 more than  1500Million Marks are required for these  charges,The export  surplus at  its best, - calculated onthe basis of  the first four months of the  current year - cannot yield more than 1200 Millions,but will probably be much  less in view of the  in-creasing obstacles put in the way of  Germain  exportsIt emerges from these  figures that a  net deficit
                   rr&apos;4rhas to be expected even now. Under these circum-stances it depends entirely on the result  of the lausanne Conference whether the transfer of theinterest - and sinking-fund charges can be continiIf the Lausanne Conference leads to such a resultas to give confidence and re-assurance to theinternational business community, it will  Depossible to avert the danger of having to  stoptransfers. If, on the contraryt the lausanne conference does not produce such a result  and if,consequently^ the existing lack of confidence is increased and the prevailing tendency of every country shutting itself off against others withregard to the exchange of capital and goods isfurther accentuated, the German Government willbe obliged to approach Germany&apos;s private creditors,A few smaller states have already had to stoptransferring the interest- and sinking-fundcharges on their foreign debts; others are facedwith the immediate necessity of doing so.Perhaps the international capitalistic structuremight still survive the breakdown and the cessation of payments on the part of thesesmaller states, but when the same happens withregard to Germany playing a prime part in theinternational exchange of capital and goods,                                       thiS i . f .mwrmBnHillillilllMIIIIIIIIM
this structure would he most seriously shaken.After the recent collapses of various financialinstitutes of international importance and inview of the general financial strain and weak-ness in all countries the cessation of thetransfers in Germany is liable to produce menanc-ing results on the general financial stabilityalso beyond Germany.  It is, therefore, no longera Reparation issue or a specifically german problem, but a quite general one that has to besettled in trie interest not only of all debtors,but also of all- creditor countries.     Owing to this development it is now generalrecognised that Germany cannot pay Reparationsafter tho end of the Hoover year and for an indefinite period thereafter.  But moreover, theGerman Government do not see the possibility ofany compromise-solutions being basod on the hopoof later improvements,.  Such an improvement willnot take place if the world is not rendered free of those disturbances which in the past haveemanated from the exclusively political debt payments and which, even if upheld partially and fo:a later date, are bound to prevent the return ofconfidence in international business.  IJLJL-J?,necessary now to draw the conclusions, from thisvicious,, circle,;  furthermore , Germany cannot                                        again...
                      -6ragain as in past Reparation settlements place her-self in the position of having alone to bear therisk of a future development which nobody can fore-see.     Apart from this the situation in the U..S.A. ,which hold the key for the settlement of the problemof international debts,requires the negative liquid-dation of the Reparation question in the common interest of all European states.  It is evidentfrom many statements of responsible American states-men and parliamentarians that only in the case ofa complete cancellation of Reparations a similarattitude of the U.S.A, can be hoped for withregard to their foreign claims.  If on the contrarythe Reparation creditors should insist on claiminga final payment, it would have to be assumed thatthe U.S.A. would insist on a corresponding finalpayment from their European debtors to be fixedaccording to their capacity to pay.  In maintainingany kind of Reparation payments the Creditor powers would, therefore, retain only a very small immediatefinancial advantage, if any.  The damage whichwould be caused by the Lausanne Conference notleading to an agreement on the complete cancellation-tion of Reparations would be out of any proportion to the inconsiderable advantage obtained by them.
     As to the positive task of the Lausanne Con-ference, the German Government sees this in later-national collaboration in the financial and econe-mic field. The terms of reference of the lausanne conference? proposed by tho British Government inFebruary last and adopted by the other ReparationPowers, cover not only the Reparations question,but also the &quot;other economic and financial diffl--culties which are responsible for and which may          -prolong the present world crisis&quot;. In the opinionof the Gorman Government of these two problems the solution of the financial problems is more urgent than the economic problem. Important as would be the abolition of the impediments to tru6-&apos;leading ever more and more to a complete stagnationin the international exchange of goods, everystop towards their removal would remain compari-tively without success unless the financial diffi-culties had boon removed before.  Even if all the obstacles in the way of normal trade were to beremoved without delay, yet the international ex--Jchange of goods could not be restarted withoutnormalising the international movement of capital,which is a condition for the exchange of goods.     The German Government have learned with interest of the intentions of the British Govern-ment and of their preliminary pourparlers with                                        the....
                           -8-the Government of the U.S.A. as to the summoning of an international economic Conference.  Theyhave not yet been informed which in detail willbe the objects of this Conference.  In any casethe German Government note with satisfaction thatthe views of the two Governments are in agreement as to the necessity of holding such a Conference.     The aim of that Conference, in its financial aspect, should in the opinion of the German Gov-ernment be threefold: viz.  to stipulate the in-ternaticnal measures with a view 1) to enable all states to bring their currencies back to a stable,relation to gold, 2) to adapt the level of interestand amortisation of private debts abroad to the changed conditions, especially to the change ingold value and commodity prices, 3) to render theabolition of the existing foreign exchange restric-tions possible.  Only if those objects are solvedpreviously or simultaneously, international agree-ments on the free exchange of goods have any prospect of success.  The German Government aroat the same time willing to take part in inter-national negotiations aiming at the abolition ofthe existing obstructions to the exchange ofgoods, such as import prohibitions and quotas,and at a general lowering of industrial tariff,                    London, June 6th,  1932,
