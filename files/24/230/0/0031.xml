MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  AIR.    I FORWARD herewith some comments by the Chief of the Air Staff on theeffects  of  the proposals contained in CP. 164 (32) on our responsibilities TorImperial Defence.    I entirely agree with the criticisms put  forward by the  Chief of the AirStaff, which show that the proposals for the international control of civil aviationare impracticable from  an  administrative point  of view, would  cripple  animportant  and growing  industry in this country, and would not  afford thesecurity which is desired unless the quotas  were fixed at an  impossibly low level.              .     ,    I wish, however, to take this opportunity of urging my colleagues to consideronce again where we stand with  regard  to the  Disarmament Conference, andwhether we should continue to advocate qualitative disarmament on humanitarianor other grounds.    The real difficulties of the  Disarmament  Conference  are political, nottechnical.   As yet,  no  satisfactory line of policy on the political side has beendecided upon, and  we are therefore now confronted with  the latest  and  most dangerous extension of the qualitative theory, which is that we should advocate the abolition of one of the three fighting services simply  in order to make a striking gesture of some kind or another.  But it  is impossible to achieve any large or striking measure of disarmament until  the  political difficulties whichunderlie every proposal that is put forward and every speech that is made at theConference have been dealt with; and from everything I have  seen and heard atGeneva the solution of the political difficulties  depends more upon the attitude ofthis country than on any  other factor.    I would therefore support the proposals made in sub-paragraphs (2) to-\5) ofparagraph 14 of enclosure II in that paper.  To my mind, the essential feature ofthese proposals is the political truce, and I would urge particularly that it shouldbe linked up with the proposed concession  to Germany on the subject of weapons and vessels forbidden by  the  Versailles Treaty.    If the political situation and our attitude thereto were clearly defined, itmight,  I  think,  also  be possible  to  achieve some  measure of  disarmamentalong the  lines of restricting the size of ships of war,  submarines, tanks,  gunsand military  aircraft.   This  principle has already  been  adopted in  theWashington and London Naval Treaties,  and if success along these lines couldbe obtained it would satisfy that world opinion which we are assured is watching the proceedings of the Conference with such  anxiety.  Moreover; coupled  withthe promise of a further Conference in  three years&apos;  time, such a step might reasonably be regarded as a first instalment.                        .  v  ;        &apos;   &apos; .  ,   ,    : &apos;.................................L.

               MEMORANDUM BY THE  CHIEF OF THE AIR  STAFF.    ,:    ,1.  The Air Staff have, now examined as fully as possible within the limited time available  the proposals for Air Disarmament circulated as enclosure II to cp. 164 (32).    2.  The Secretary  of State for Air in  his  Memorandum  to  the  Cabinet(CP.  181  (32)) has already dealt with  the wider  political  aspects of therestriction   of  civil. aviation within  limits  which would  prevent   it  fromdominating at the outset wars from which trained air forces had been excluded.It remains for  the Air Ministry now to find the answers to three&apos;questions :        I. Whether the proposals  are workable.     II. What price, from  the defence aspect, it would be necessary to pay for             putting them into operation.    III.-What degree of security would  be  achieved in return for the  price             paid.    3.  Are the proposals workable&apos;?    The Air Ministry  presume that  His Majesty&apos;s Government would not be deterred from  advocating the  Internationalisation of Civil Aviation on theground only that it would be a form of control  incompatible with its naturaldevelopment.  That internationalisation would be thus incompatible is not opento question as may be realised if we imagine what the rate  and extent of  develop-ment  of the various railway systems,  mercantile  marine  systems and- motor transport industries of the world would have been if they had been subjected intheir formative period  to administration and control by  a single pan-nationalauthority.  The Air Ministry, however, appreciate that these inherent disadvan-tages in any system of  internationalised administration might be considered tohe worth tolerating as the price of freedom from the air menace, and  that theissue which has to be examined is not whether internationalised control of civilaviation would be inefficient, but whether it could be workable at all.    4.  It is realised that the Foreign Office  proposals are put  forward as an outline only with a promise of their future development in greater  detail.  TheAir Ministry,  are, however,  convinced that  no  amount  of elaboration wouldprovide  workable solutions  to the  innumerable problems, political,   financialand administrative, which  any scheme of internationalisation would  present.They may observe that  when the question of  internationalisation was examined by the Cabinet Committee  on Disarmament,  it was held to be impracticable,though the proposal was then untrammelled by the complication of restriction onits natural  growth, and  not linked with a  scheme for  the  total  abolition ofmilitary air rorces.    5.  It is, in the  first place, proposed in the Foreign  Office scheme  that theinternational authority  should take over the control  of all  existing or new inter-national air lines  and be responsible for their future development.  Would the funds  required to finance   the operations of the   international authority  beobtained from  the private investor  or by quotas from the countries over whichthey were to operate ?  The former method Avould have no  chance of success withthe absence of  backing and  guarantees from the governments concerned, whilethe system of national, quotas would raise endless difficulties as to the determina-tion between different countries of their respective  interests in the exploitation of any particular new route or the continuance of an existing route.     6.  It is proposed, in the second  place,  that existing lines  which are notself-supporting (and this, as the  Foreign Office points out, at  present appliesin varying degrees to all  civil air lines) may be paid for  by the governments atpresent paying for them.   The  international authority  is  for  the future to administer control, but the cost involved will fall on a particular country.  Thatimplies a  divorce  of financial responsibility  from operational  control, whichwould  be a source of endless difficulties and disputes.     7.--(a) The existing policy, again, with regard to the basis and  object of subsidies to civil aviation differs widely  in different countries.  In  this country the commercial aspect predominates and subsidies  ^are on a downward sliding scale.  French  subsidies, on the other hand, have been fixed on the level necessaryto secure the operation of routes considered politically desirable without regardto more immediate commercial possibilities.  The Dutch system, again,  is based
on the guarantee  of  a load - of mails supplemented by. direct subsidy.   Other-States employ  other  methods.  Is  it possible to hope that an  international authority, when it took over the control of international civil aviation, would succeed in reconciling the various  objectives which each  country  is&apos; at presentfree to settle and pursue for itself %    (b) Again, upon  the  international authority would devolve the control ofmanufacture of aircraft, and of their export from one country to another.  Withthis responsibility would  be involved  the allotment  of orders for aircraft forthe use of the  international air lines as approved and operated  by the inter-national authority.  Is it reasonable to think that this task would be carriedout without friction and  jealousies, and the exercise of every form of pressure from different countries in the  interests of their own particular industries, with consequent irritation to international relationships?    In considering the possibilities of  the international organisation of civilaviation the proceedings of the meeting  of  the Air Transport Air Co-operationCommittee at Geneva held as  recently as the 9th to the  12th May are  also ofsignificance.  That meeting was attended  by civil aviation  experts of  all theleading Powers, and  the  report of their proceedings  shows that, in  the viewof many of those  best qualified to appraise  the problems of  administration ofcivil aviation, the practical possibilities of international organisation are strictly limited and, in  any  event, depend upon  the  free  co-operation of nationalorganisations, and not upon the creation of a single super-national body.  Thiswas the view expressed by some of the  most important  countries represented,for example, United States of America, Germany, Italy and Holland.  It shouldbe particularly noted that none of the measures for international co-operation which came under review  by that Committee approached in complexity or rangethese  proposals now adumbrated by the Foreign Office.    8.  The Air Ministry are, in short, convinced that the concentration of allinternational air services  in the hands of a single authority on which  would be imposed also the further burden of supervision of the quotas of national aircraft,of manufacture and  of export of  aircraft would throw  upon that body  tasks of such complexity and magnitude that the early and inevitable result  wouldbe its  complete failure.    It is impossible  to ignore the practical defects and very limited organicvitality possessed  by  international  authorities when  they  attempt  to operate asadministrative bodies.    9.  An earlier question of great difficulty, which would have to be settled,even before the creation  of the international aviation  authority,  would be theallocation of quotas of national aircraft for each State.   The scheme contem-plates that these quotas should be laid down in the  Convention itself.   On thebasis  of the Foreign Office Draft this process would consist of two stages :  first,the drawing of the line dividing major from minor Powers, and, secondly, the fixing of the numerical limits in large and  small aircraft for  the two classes ofPowers thus formed. This earlier stage already brings considerable complications;highly advanced though small countries like Holland would certainly resent it ifthe dividing line put them in the lower category, while China and Persia were inthe higher.    It would be in the fixing of the numerical limits that the first great test ofthe practicability of the scheme would lie.  From the British point of  view, thefundamental requirement  of the proposals for the abolition of air forces would bethat the numbers of civil aircraft should be very severely restricted.  This is notonly necessary in order to achieve the purpose of His Majesty&apos;s Government of removing the potential air menace  to  civilian populations  generally on theoutbreak of war, but  is also essential from narrower considerations of our own security.  The  economic and geographical conditions of the British Islands arenot such as to support naturally the number of civil transport aircraft that manycontinental  countries will genuinely need.   If, therefore, the limit for largeaircraft is fixed high we should have no hope of maintaining equality in numbers.We should  be  compelled  to ask for  a  low limit and  should immediately find ourselves in opposition to at least Germany and the United States, the latter ofwhom already possesses no fewer than 10,600 civil aircraft, public and private.It is  also fairly certain that France would ask for a limit  far above  anything       [7109] &apos;                                                    B 2
 we could attain to in practice without large subsidies, to which a military purpose would undoubtedly be  attributed.   If we, failed to obtain  this low  limit-an unnaturally low  one  in the case of some  continental countries  and the United States-we should be  outbuilt in peace and consequently menaced in war.     10.!: Leaving out of account,  therefore, the question  whether the ruthless restriction of civil aviation is or is not too high a price to pay, the conclusion is reached  that  these proposals, are  workable only  on the assumption that all countries would  submit to interference with their  liberty  and to inspection of their activities by an  international authority, and that countries such as America, Germany and France would agree to really low numerical limits (far lower than&apos; the former possess to-day).    These are very sweeping assumptions,  and it is unjustifiably optimistic to believe that they could be fulfilled indefinitely.                          II. The Price  to be Paid.     11.  Turning now  to the  second  question,  which  is to assess the extent to which the absence of  aircraft will adversely affect Imperial  defence, it is possible to develop considerably some of the objections put forward by the General Staff.     It must be pointed out that the defence problems which involve  the  use of aircraft as an essential factor in their  economical solution have been very largely, if not entirely, outside  the direct responsibilities and  experience of any service department except the  Air Ministry, and that  this may  in part explain the tendency for military opinion at  home to underrate the importance of air power overseas.     The Government of  India,  within  whose  jurisdiction there have been unrivalled opportunities to acquire  the necessary practical experience during the last two&apos; years, are under no delusions on this matter, as  will be shown later. Successive  High  Commissioners in  Iraq have testified to the  indispensability of the air arm, while at  Aden there is an unparalleled  object lesson in the fact that the maintenance  of the integrity of the Protectorate and the fulfilment of our treaty pledges to the  tribes have been rendered practicable only since air forces were constituted the main defence.     The North-West  Frontier, Iraq, Aden,  Transjordan and the Persian Gulf are the areas to consider in estimating what the disappearance  of air power would mean, and the Air Staff submit that their own opinion, backed as it is by that of the Government of India, and  High Commissioners concerned,  should  be looked upon as authoritative.   They are confident that an unprejudiced examination of the question will  lead to the conclusion that air forces are absolutely essential tothe adequate protection of our  interests abroad.     12.  The present importance of air forces in oversea defence is due to     (a)  The extension of British interests  and responsibilities.     (6). Increase  in   the  fighting power  of the  semi-civilised and uncivilised         v.  peoples on our borders.    (c)  The growth of new disruptive influences, such as Soviet Russia and the           post-war Congress in India. It is also very necessary to take account of the  psychological  effect which would be  created by the removal of the  arm which  for  nearly ten  years  has been extensively depended upon  as the primary means of maintaining  order in disturbed areas.    , (a)  The extension of British responsibilities comprises commitments in Iraq and the mandated territories in the Middle East.  The admission of Iraq to the League can in no way alter the fact that we are in the  last resort responsible for the British lives  and  the protection of the commercial resources in that country&apos;.    A further extension of responsibility is brought about by the  increased importance of the Persian and Iraq oil fields and by the existence of the main air route to the East; it is essential that the security of the air bases necessary for this route  in Iraq  and on the Persian Gulf should be effectively provided for. s  .(&amp;)  The increase in the fighting  value of the  North-West  Frontier tribes, due to the acquisition  of modern-rifles  and smokeless  powder; is-universally recognised.   Our own recent developments in land  armaments, i.e., tanks and heavy artillery) are no. answer, as they cannot usually be taken  to the places where
the.  tribes, have  to  be fought.  -The  aeroplane is, and has been proved -onnumberless occasions to be, the effective answer.  -  &apos;&quot;i  ..     ? . - -        ;  i;-&apos;.     (c) The importance of the new factors of Soviet and Congress intrigue willbe readily appreciated.   With agents sown broadcast through the British Fnipireand  along its borders ready  to seize on any trouble wherever the chance may occur, the necessity for quick  action  is imperative.  If  air  forces  are notavailable, the only alternative  is to station garrisons in areas in which disaffectionmay occur.     13.   The psychological factor is perhaps the most  important of all.   Thereis scarcely a disaffected tribe  from the Khyber to Khartoum that has not at onetime or another  during the last ten years been dealt  with by the air method.Many of them have  realised that the aeroplane is the one weapon to which theyhave no answer, and it would be possible to fill many pages with descriptions of operations which, carried out by aircraft, alone or in  conjunction with groundtroops, were a complete success, but which either could  not have been carried out at all, or would have involved  prohibitive expense and loss of life, if aircraft hadnot been used. .     The Air Staff have no  doubt that the sudden disappearance of the air armwould be the signal  for  every  disaffected  community or  individual  to tryconclusions with  the Government.  The  result would be a heavy crop of trouble-some small  wars, involving great loss  of life by casualties and sickness andenormous expenditure of money.  .   14.  The  danger spots  would be as  foliows :-      (a) At Aden, where the Imam of Yemen would attempt the reoccupation of          the areas from which  he was  evicted in 1928 by air action.  To retain          our prestige and discharge our Treaty obligations to the tribes  would          then entail operations on a considerable scale.  It is relevant to observe          . that the  War Office estimated a few years ago that an expedition by          ground forces to expel the Imam would cost  from  6- 10 millions.          Subsequent occupation of the reoccupied territory would be required          at  a cost  that has never, so far as the Air Staff know, been computed.          Air Forces, on the  other hand,, control without occupation.     M  :     .(6) In Iraq, the  Government would collapse  unless  British  Forces  were          present in considerable numbers to maintain  its authority. The recent          reverse suffered by  the Iraq Army in Kurdistan, which was only saved          from  disaster at the last  moment by air action, leaves no doubt as to          the inability of the native forces to deal unaided with their  internal          defence  problems.  The High  Commissioner,  referring  to  that          country&apos;s stability after  entry into the League in  1932,  stated in a          telegram  two years ago :                   &quot;..  .  . .  I  am  personally of opinion  that the whole fabric of             administration of this country  would  be in  imminent danger of             collapse  if  the  Royal Air Force were confined,  to Shaiba  in             1932. ...&quot;       &apos;                         &apos;       -!               His opinion as to the effects of total abolition would be of interest.           Could we possibly contemplate such  a break-up in view of the very          large  commercial interests which are  growing up round the oil-fields          in  Northern Iraq, and in  face of our championship before the League          of  the independence of that country ?   There is also the question of          our responsibility under the terms of our Treaty with Iraq by which          we have  promised our help  in  the event of  external  aggression.          Far from being able to abandon the country (as the C.I.G.S. suggests),          we should soon find ourselves involved in very serious military com- ; .  v, .   commitments from  which there  would be no  escape,  other  than a       ;  repudiation of our Treaty obligations and  the  abandonment of our         , commercial interests.  ..             .........    .&apos;(c) In the Persian Gulf, where our interests in the air route make it essential ,.  t   .,. ito.be able to deal with hostile elements, we should be thrown back upon          the use of  naval power, -which;* however  effective it* may be on the i&apos;  .  .  -  seaboard, cannot touch the inland tribes, who,  if freed from the fear    . ,v -   of  air attack,, are well able to overpower  the more friendly elements&apos;
           on the coast, and by attacking the air  bases of the civil  air route           involve us in the need for punitive expeditions by military forces.     (d) It is on the North-West Frontier of India that the most constant use of           air power has been made in recent years.   It is common knowledge           that the Government of India cannot be  accused of exaggerating the           importance of the air arm, and their considered and recently expressed           opinion as to the probable results of abolishing air action against the           tribes is  therefore all the more significant:                  &quot;. . . .  a  movement,  capable  of  easy suppression by aerial             action will gain momentum, will tend to spread to different parts of             the  tribal area, will establish and organise connections with hostile             elements in British India, will give rise to exaggerated reports of             tribal  intervention,  and  will give continuous and  progressive             impetus to subversive movements  in India generally, and especially             in North-West Frontier Province.  This process may go on for weeks             or even months, and in the meantime, we shall be practically power-             less to  deal with the situation. We should have to wait  until the             situation  has  developed  into  armed incursion  into&apos;  our  own             territory . . .  .&quot; (telegram No. 924, the 7th April, 1932).     15.  The conseqence of the disappearance of air forces from India, Iraq,Aden, and the Persian Gulf  would in short be      (a) A series  of  costly  tribal wars  as the only alternative to the admission          of  our impotence  to maintain our  present  responsibilities for the          preservation of  public order, and     (b)  Substantially increased  provision  of other  defence forces in the areas        &apos;  from which air  forces will  have been eliminated.  It  is significant           that the General Staff consider that the removal of the air arm would          force the  Government of India to implement the policy of occupation          up to the Durand Line!   (CP.  176 (32).)   By the &quot;analogy of the          occupation  of  Waziristan this would involve  a large  amount  of          military expenditure by the  Government  of  India.                      III. The Benefit to be Derived.     16.  Perhaps the most  important of the three  questions to which answershave to be found is  the last what benefit should we derive from the  proposedabolition of air  forces and  restriction  of  civil aviation in return for the very heavy price we should have  to pay ?     We should save the expenditure now  devoted to air forces.   But  there arethe enhanced risks in oversea defence referred to in the previous  section.  Thereis the re-occupation by ground  troops  of  territories now controlled by  the air arm without  occupation.   There is the  recurring cost  of  tribal  wars, nowprevented by the existence of air power, but surely to be provoked by its  abolition.These must be placed on the debit side, and  it is  not apparent that the cashbalance would be  a  very   substantial one.   Apart  from  this,  there  is  the inevitable loss of British prestige and of British lives entailed by  a  reversion to the old method of warfare.  Moreover, the belief expressed in paragraphs 19and 20  of  CP.  164 (32) that a reduction in the size  of battleships and other-consequential  savings in naval  expenditure would  follow is not well  founded,.and is already disclaimed by the Admiralty (CP. 182  (32)), who state  (i) thatthe removal of the  risk of attack  from the  air is unlikely  to admit  of any appreciable  reduction in the size of capital ships,  and  (ii) that it may resultin a need for more cruisers.     To base any reduction of defensive power of our ships on the belief  that theywould  not have to face the risks of air attack in the future would be utterlyunsound, since, at an early  stage of war, and despite any Convention  for theabolition of bombing,  air forces would  reappear at the  instance of the Powerwho stood to gain most from their general employment,  and in  numbers whichwould  be a  serious menace  to the movements of the Fleet.  The rate  at whichthey could be recreated would depend almost entirely on the degree of prepara-tion made in peace  by all  nations.  Judging from  the analogy  of gas, anotherprohibited  weapon,  the most elaborate plans  for the  purpose  of  raising andequipping  air forces would,  after  a  few years,  be  regarded  as  a  normal
precaution.   But whatever degree of preparation, might be. made in peace, it is out of the question that the fleet could be as quickly brought back to its presentcapacity for self-defence  against air attack.  Moreover, it would take years tobuild aircraft carriers, and until these were provided the operations of our fleetcould be kept under surveillance by civil aircraft from the earliest stages of war.     It is, however, in the case of the bombing of London  that this power tore build air forces exposes most clearly as an illusion the sense of  security which many seem  to think would follow the abolition of air forces.   It  may not be generally  appreciated how rapidly aircraft and engines can be  produced.   Inthe late war, when we  were simultaneously meeting unparalleled commitments in materiel  for land and  sea warfare, and without having had  any opportunityfor the comprehensive co-ordination of industry  which has since  been undertaken by many major  Powers, this country was at one time  turning  out no less than100  complete aircraft a day.   On the entry of  the United States into the war,a new engine was designed, built, and flown within three months, and 13,000were produced in a further four months.  If the whole of a country&apos;s industry were to be co-ordinated on a plan which gave  priority to air equipment, thereis no question that these rates of output could be very largely exceeded.  So much would  turn  on even a few weeks&apos; or  days&apos; advantage over an enemy that therecan be no doubt that every Power would within a few years formulate such a plan.     Moreover, after the initial respite was over, the results would be far more serious than those we have to  face under the present conditions.  There wouldbe no defensive organisation, no bombing  of aerodromes to interrupt the enemy&apos;operations (for  such  attack  to be effective  must be accurately aimed).  Eachbelligerent  would merely aim at building  weight-carrying  aircraft  and  attraining personnel only sufficiently to enable them to drop their bombs (or perhapsshells) over the great cities.  This power of re-creating air forces in war cannotbe dismissed by  saying that it  is a factor common to all forms  of disarmament.In no other form of disarmament has a  price to be paid such as that described in section II of this Memorandum. It is  one thing to save money on heavy gunsor tanks during the years of peace, so that all nations may start from &quot; scratch &quot;in war.  It  is quite another to pay a heavy price in peace for the protection ofthe lives of civilians in war and then to find  that civilian life is not in factprotected  at all.     Air defence  cannot be made effective without a high degree of perfection inequipment and training.  Air-attack, on the other hand, can be  carried out byany  aircraft capable  of carrying a cargo of explosives over London or Paris.These are the essential points of difference between disarmament  in the air andon land or sea.     17.  The crux of the whole matter in this, as in other aspects of the problem,is that the  abolition of air forces and the restriction of civil  aviation  cannotprevent the resurrection of military  aircraft in large  numbers immediately  onthe outbreak of  war.   Only the  complete abolition of flying  itself would,  be effective.     18.  There are other  aspects of the position in war after the abolition of airforces that must not be overlooked, though they are, perhaps, less important thanthe foregoing.  It is sometimes forgotten that the last war saw not only the firstuse of aircraft, but also the first effective use of another product of modern science,the submarine.   If submarines are to continue in their present numbers, theymight  once  again constitute  a  serious menace to our  existence, as they  did  in1917.  At the end of the last war we had several hundreds of aircraft engaged in anti-submarine co-operation, and although they  did not themselves destroy manysubmarines, they were considered, and still are considered by the Naval Staff,  an integral part of anti-submarine forces.     Again,  it must not be forgotten that in this  attempt to save the country fromthe horrors  of air attack  in one particxdar war (in which the menace would, infact, not be  removed, but only deferred), we should deny ourselves a weapon thatmight prevent smaller and very much more probable wars.  The Royal Air force is even now the spearhead of our power, just as the Navy is our shield, and, if weever had to implement our Locarno guarantees, we could, as an industrial nation,more effectively, and with  less risk, commit ourselves to use machine power ratherthan man power as our contribution.     19-  It is the avowed object of the proposals in G.P. 164 (32)  to bring aboutthe &apos;&apos; development of civil aviation.&quot;
     It has been shown in-  Section I of the present memorandum that any suchresult would be most improbable.     Assuming, however, that internationalisation was followed by large increases in the numbers of internationally-controlled aircraft and the ground organisa-tions for maintaining them, this would bring in its train still another formidabledanger.                                                                ........     It must be  assumed  that, whatever promises were made in peace, nations would on the outbreak of  war seize the aircraft within  their borders and employfor military purposes  all the aerodromes and air resources available.   On this assumption,  Great Britain would  be  found at a grievous disadvantage.  Theproportion of large aircraft in each country at any time would be roughly similarto the mileage of international routes  within  each nation&apos;s jurisdiction, and though we could probably impound a larger number than any other single Power,we could not bring any, except those in Britain itself, to the decisive point.  TheFrench could not only lay hand on a greater number in the  home country, but could also fly back to France all the international aircraft seized in her colonial dependencies in Africa.   .     20.  In conclusion, one more difficulty has to be examined.  It is far fromclear what  would happen if disagreement arose, at a later stage,  among thenations signatory to the convention.  It is more than likely that, following theconfusion which  is  inevitable in the working of  an International authorityexercising functions of almost superhuman complexity, a serious disagreementwould arise among the signatory Powers.  If one single major Power denouncedthe Convention, the basis  of the settlement on which military air forces had been abolished would be upset, and the whole delicate balance of power,  so carefullyand. laboriously adjusted  on the assumption that military air forces would notbe maintained, would be irretrievably put out of gear.                             IV. Conclusions.     21.   The main conclusions following from this necessarily hurried examina-tion of  the proposals  of the Secretary of State for  Foreign  Affairs  may  bosummarised as follows :       (a)  The proposals in  CP. 164 (32) can only be regarded as  impracticable in          operation.  Moreover, they contain the seed of interminable disputes,          which would not contribute to  international harmony.     (b)  The. natural opportunities for  the development of  civil aviation  are-           smaller in Great Britain than in many other countries.  In order to        .  relieve this country from the threat of air attack at the outbreak of          war, the  restrictions  on the permissible  numbers of aircraft in other        .. countries would have to be so severe as to be intolerable to them.     (c) Even if civil aviation were crippled, the air menace would not be removed          from war.  Air  Forces would be rapidly re-created  on the outbreak          of hostilities.  The menace to civil populations would then be worse          than, before.  If  the air menace is to go, all flying must go.     (d)  In our oversea defence  and administration, the  abolition of air forces.          would involve  consequences which cannot be fully examined within       ..   the scope of this Memorandum.   The Air Staff would urge that the          opinions  should  be obtained  of  High Commissioners who have had          first-hand experience of the  use of air power.     (e)  In order to  achieve the  illusion  of security in one possible war, we are           asked  to  forgo a weapon which it would be most advantageous for           us to use in any other  wars, while forcibly restricting the  benefits           which the free development of Aviation would undoubtedly give the           Avorld during the long years of peace.   -  22.  In a sentence, therefore, we are asked to pay a high price in an  attempt&apos;to: achieve something which is very near to being impossible, and which,  if wemanaged to;achieve it,  would, in fact, give us only the illusion of  what we sought.    &apos; Air Ministry, June 3, 1932.             .       &apos;  .:       &quot;o
