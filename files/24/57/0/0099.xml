(THIS TS -TO ?RO?i?CT Off HI3 ERITAWTO MAJESTY;S /^OWHfe^)(0 (4 j/T\ WAR CABINET *SICRP1T.      1 v&apos; I0 J&apos;.t&apos;.C98/&quot;T PROPAGMPA,Note by the Secretary.Application has been made by the Ministry of Information for the use of information given in a Memorandum by the Ministry of National Service, (G.T.4872) for the purpose of constructing propaganda articles,This application was referred to Sir Auckland Geddes, who points out that the Memorandum referred to contains many figures and facts such as some of .the recommendations of the Cabinet Committee on Man-Power,, which cannot be made public. Sir Auckland Geddes, however, considers that this question is one of pia-lioy and for the consideration of the War Cabinet. The Minister of Information, being responsible for propaganda, must have full information,; and as other Government Departments have not the staff or the time to undertake Propaganda work or to supervise the work done by the Ministry of Information, Sir Auckland is of opinion that it should rest with the Minister of Information, who, like other Ministers, acts under the general direction of the War Cabinet, to decide how much of the inform-ation at his disposal can properly be used for Propaganda purposes.    Any other course would lead to unnecessary duplication of work and interference in the sphere of the Minister of Information.The decision of the War Cabinet is therefore suggested as to whether;-(a) All available information should be supplied to the Minister of Information by the War Cabinet Secretariat to be used by him at his discretion,or(b) The Ministry of Information should submit its articles to the Department or Departments concerned for censoring before publication.(Sgd) H.P.A. HANKBY
