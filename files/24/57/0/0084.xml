flT/IS THE PROPERTY OF HI3 BRITAJTIO IgAJI^r&quot;; 9 SSffiMRlLS S 0 R E T, GiT,,5083.197-CABINET,CONDITIONS AT.ONGST PRISONERS OF \7AR &apos; AND CIVILIANS IN GERMANY AND HOLLAND.(Note of statements and Surest ions made by Miss Vulliamy.)I have had particular facilities for hearing from direct sources tho conditions in Germany, having worked in Holland since 1914 and havin? met all prisoners,, repatriated and interned.. There is a strong feeling amongst the men that tho privates have not been considered in the exohan/^e.   Thi3 has crusted a feeling of extreme- bitterness against the British Government.   I think there i3 little doubt that the Germans foresaw this possibility when they would not discuss the .question of exchange of privates, &apos; realising what a grave source&apos; of danger these men would become to England.   Many officers first Considered refusing to come tc Holland, then decided they could help tho case of the privates more by doing so.   The men themselves consider they have been deserted because they are valueless from a military point of view in this country.   This applies not only to the British .... 30ldier, but also to the thousands of overseas soldiers whose attitude to the Mother country i3 likely to be a aeriou3 menace which is daily increasing, and large socialistic meetings are being held in many of the men1 s camps.   Further,- the privates have sent a message to say that they have.decidud they cannot hold out any longer and will a^ret to work in German munition factories vihert they are offered good treatment, gjod food and good wages.I should like to lay certain facts before the War Cabinet:--    A,.   MILIT OT   (Germany), v -:-2.-   Treatment of&apos;.British Prisoners of 77ar in GermanyMost of these cases seem-to fall into two classes,,.,(!)   fases. of brutal treatment and arbitrary enforce-.&apos; &apos;.&apos; ment of ^or):;:(.2)   Cases of brutal-treatment&apos;and-negioct of men . - &quot; ::, -who r&apos;;re even. acknor&apos;lea^ed by the-German doctors&apos; to be hospital cases.The   oil ov;&apos;iii&apos;3, examples tf both olasses are unquestionably -&apos; indicative of Me general, conditions amongst the ?*.C.0*s , nd men..Hi. 2518, S^; ^.ft6J&amp;ORAL HICHARD GROflMBRIDOE? 1st Life Guards,, it prepared to tfwear :-&quot;At the bertinn^ of .1915, I was Raftered Langensalza Camp (sachsen) where X. 1stCompanyv This company consisted of 100 men of all national!tieWV... jh; this company&apos; there&quot; Were some 40: British ^&apos;risan&apos;irs\;o^Vvrar and in the Camps; about 75.

Before this ma^n vras anything likfc eoriValeseent h*       turned out of hospital iiri&amp; put
ff 1 1back into his ordinary hut.   Ho was so weak that he could not struggle to the latrine without my assistance, end on a oertaindoy this man asked me to help him down to tho latrine.   It was freezing and snow was on the ground and tho only clothes he had oonsisted of a German ootton shirt, a pair of short Russian trousers, no sooka, and a pair of wooden ologs.   While he was in the latrine I went into tho washhouse close by to got some water for him.   Hardly had I got into the washhouse when a German Officer, one Feldwebel, 2 Unter-Offiziers end a German soldier, who was armed with rifle and fixed bayonet entered.    They called a Russian soldior, prisoner of war, inside, and made him&apos; stand on the door.    Tho officer whom I understood perfectly well said:   &quot;Wir werden dioser Sohwoino ICaput machen&quot; (we111 break this swine) or words to that offset.    The officer and the Foldwebel unbuckled their swords and the Unter-Offiziers took their bayonets off and proceeded to belabouryethe German soldier did the same thing with the butt of his rifle.     I was repeatedly struck on the head and the body.   I fought as best I could, but the odds were against me.   Eventually I got the Russian away from the door and got out of tho washhouse.   The German officer Feldwebel, Inter-Offiziers and soldier followed me and again attacked me Outside before about 300 or 400 prisoners of war of all nationalities, including two Americans (one a Mr. John Burke of New York) who subsequently made a report of this inoident in the newspapers,   I eventually got away, but I still suffer from the effects of this treatment.&quot;NO.32018 SERGEANT WILLIAM BENNETT,52nd Battery, R.F.A. isprepared to swear to the following :-&quot;During October 1917 a British prisoner of war spoke to me in Solteu Camp.   I did not recognise him until ho madehimself known to me that he was&apos; Fte,....... of ..........Regiment, whom I had known very well.   He had been sent to a Kommando in about August 1916,   He used to be a fine, strong man, but has how shrunk away and is a complete, physical wreck.    I invited him to my room, and he told me in the presence of CS. Major Booth, K O.Y.LI, that he,had been sent to a salt mine known as Kaliwerk, prinz Adalbert, and hod been worked continually for two months when ho became So ill that he could not strnd it any longer so   reported sick.   He was told by an ordinary German soldier that he was fit for any work.   He applied to see a certified doctor, and refused to go down the mine until ho had done so.   The German Feldwebel told him that if he did not go down he would be thrown down.   Ho then stood at tho edge of the cage and said he would make him enter the cage voluntarily.     To accomplish this the Feldwobel placed a German soldier with fixed bayonet, held six inches behind him. and told him the bayonet would be advanced through him if he did not go down,    When the bayonet pricked him he went down the mine.,  on that occasion, after finishing his eight hours work, he was plaoed in a,small room where he only received a small portion of bread and water-soup instead of going to his proper barracks with his comrades.    Ho did this punishment on this diet for 14 days and continued to do his shifts of eight hours all the. while.   Eventually his health broke down completely and the German Civilian Doctor who visited the mine sent him back to Soltau whore I mot him as described.&quot;

Elsworth, liven at tho ?orga, Woolland, Blandford. Dorset, w^g discharged from the Lazarett as toured&apos; about February 1918, reported sick again shortly afterwards and ^oldwobol l rinz (? prince) Monies!an, refused to lot him see tho doctor..      Ho sent him out to work shovelling sand in the camp, and ho fainted whilst&apos; working.   Ho wont into a small lazarett in tho Lager (not the Tuberculosis lazarett) and he died there a week afterwards/   /I would further add that tho close proximity of the so-called 1 healthy&apos; or normal lager to tho Tuberculosis Lczarctt1 is most&apos;injurious to tho health of the. men, and tho continual procession of funerals and corpses&quot;is depressing, especially to tho young soldiers;&quot;&quot;I was gassed and trkon prisoner at ^illeboke on and Juno 1916, and sent to Julich Hospital.   On the end oiff JtRgwb 1916 I was transferred from Julich Hospital to Sprottau., (Sohlcsian) arriving there on 5th September 1016,   I arrived with e. party of about 50 Puss inns, v/ho joined tho train at Cologne, and wo wore left all night in fourth elf ss carriages at tjprottuu.   I was the. only Englishman, in Sprottau camp at that time, and wag. there until I loft for Holland on the 9th April 1918.     The construction of Sprottau Camp was very much the same as an ordinary menTs La-gar, but it wi-s divided into two parts; one we a colled tho tuberculosis Lazarott&apos; and the other was a &apos;normal1 prisoners Lager.   I was in the -Tuberculosis L&amp;zarott1 from September 1916 until May 1917. X passed tho Swiss Commission, on the 28th October 1917 when they rwid thoir first visit, and&apos; only visit, to this Lager, but I was not sent away.   The treatment in the Lazarott was very bad, ^nd the German hospital Dispenser told us in English, which he spoko quite well, that &quot;if any-&apos;. of us wished to got out of this.Lager alive we had bettor hot take the Gorman medicines &apos;.supplied.&quot;   7e tried to get him to explain the reason, but ho would not do so. I myself saw a French Algerian Sergeant (named Schaden?) ytfto w? s not very ill, take the medicine and ho died three rooks later.   The state of the men &quot;who come to. this tsgor is very bad indeed,, especially that of tho Russians. !J?ho Lager is connected -with the railway by a small trolley railway ; about 5 kilometres in length.   Those prisoners Who are just able to walk aro made&apos;.to&apos;walk to the camp; those who are too weak are brought up.on the trolleys. I myself havo soon one Russian who died on a trolley on the way from the station to the Lazarett.1.* * ., ( ,At least fifteen men dio daily in this Camp.   The mortuary, which I havo passed frequently on the way to the parcels Boom, is tho most horrible thing 1 have ever seen, Tho dead were thrown in there anyhow, one on top of the other, absolutely nude and I havo soon them piled up four or five deep,I estimate tho number of deaths which have, taken place in tho camp since November 1916 at more than 2-,000 and this&quot; is based on the fact that O,ergt..or Pto. Wild, East Yorks, who died very early in.January 1918 was registered as Ho. 1785 (? or at any rate was near 1800 )v There have been,tho usual average of deaths since, i*e. about fifteen daily.- &apos;d -
SERGEANT 0,T. JACKSON, let JJLnvcoJ^^^ swear to tho following- i-&quot;When I loft the camp on tho 2 nd February. 1918, thcro were in tho camp 47 cripples, all amputation cases, many of whom had been in the camp for more than 8 months.. During the winter 1917-18 they were veyy badly treated, being compelled to stand out in the snow and oold for punishment on certain occasions when we were punished. Several of them had running wounds,   Tho only medical treatment those men received was from Corporal Ilillar, who had received a Red,Cross box from home,   I tried man^ times to get them extra blankets but failed.2nd LIEUT. PIPER. 1st Essex Regiment, states&quot;As a result of a wound in my jaw I was sent away from Strohenmoor in November 1917 to No,5 lazaretto Kriogsohulo (Hannovor) (JOth Army Corps, General von Hanisch),In this Hospital there were anything between 150 and 200 German Untor-Offiziers and soldiers amongst Vvhom were a fow wounded, but tho majority were suffering from skin diseases, Gonorrhea and Syphilis.   I myself, actually saw Liout, Sutcliffe, R0F0Ca, whose leg had been amputated high up the thigh, plaoed on the operating table which had only just been vacated by a German suffering from some sort of skin, disease,   I actually saw bits of skin or 1 scabs1 on this tabls which had not been cleaned in any wayI quote this last story, though In connection with an . officer, as men are also sent to this camp, and it is such a glaring case of German callousness and neglect.I, Medical -Treatment. Doctors from the Central Camp from which the working parties are drawn do not visit the working Commandos and small camps.   The under officer in charge of the above is ofton tho civil contractor and it frequently ooours that he does not . call in the local doctor until it is too late.Sick Exchange. For the purpose of choosing the men for the sick exchange, neutral doctors do not actually go to the camps. All cases the Germans consider suitable for exchange are sent to Aachen, and there come before the neutral kiedieal Commission, In this way many sick men are noVor seen by the Commission, $he reason for this is that the Germans will keep a man If&apos; he has oven a few months1 work left in him, no^matter what his condition,, so Valueless to them is human lifej except as a medium of work.I, Pressure brought to boar oh N.0*0&quot;a to force them to work.IThis is against the British agreement.    Tho following story illustrates the case No, 8164 LOE. SERGT. ALBERT VEOK. 2nd Wiltshire Regt- is &quot;prepared to swear to the following&quot;In September 1917, I was one of a party of about 900 British non-commissioned officers, who were sent i       from various camps to Bohmte, which is about SO kilometresIfrom $enabir&amp;Qkf and situated in the 10th Army Corps (General von Haniech),   The Commandant was Feldwebel   &apos; Lieut, von. Miller,   When we arrived we were asked by the Commandant if we would work outside the damp.   We   -all refused,   Y/hen our parcels arrived about 10 days ago
ago he refused to allow ue to draw them; he told ub if we volunteered to work we might have them.   We still refused;. He then formed us up in the centre of the camp and made us &apos;stillgestenden* (stand to attention&apos;) for seven or eighi hours ej/iay.   We got into touch with the Dutch representa-;; tive, and the Commandant told us that if the Dutch represr entative decided in our favour he would punish us with    I eight hours *stillgestenden&apos;.     The Dutch representative came down and &apos;stillgestenden&apos; was abolished.   The Command-ant then had our private bread cut up in the cookhouse anil put into the soup.   He forced Sergt. Cheesley of my        i Battalion, who was the N.C0. in charge of the parcels to&apos; open our parcels and abstract bread for this purpose.   We were brought to such,a pitch of starvation that we event-: ually consented to.&apos;work outside the camp, and we were made to dig ground for cultivation.   The daily taBk was for each man to dig one metre by 20 metres.   The Commandant informe4 us that this work was for the benefit of the.Camp, which   &quot; was obviously untrue as nothing was planted on it.   Whilst we did this work we   received our parcels,   later on we started to work on cutting heather;   the daily task was 1 x 20 metres, and this was increased to 1 x 60 metres. We then refused to work.   In consequence the sentries formed us up on the heath and we used to be made to stand to atten-tion from 1 to 4 p..m. or 1 to 5 p.m., and when the Commandant   himself came out from 1 to 6 p.m. in all weathers.   We had to do this during the bitter weather of Fenruary 1918.   Instead of this we had to parade all day I long to show various articles of equipment such a3 at 9 a.m. we paraded with bedding, then we were dismissed and paraded with spoons, then with eating bowls and so on up i: to about 4 p.m.   One day while it was raining hard he made us parade outside in the rain with our bedding until it was thoroughly soaked through.There is abundant evidence of this being the general praotice and unlimited proof can be furnished from Holland.Employment of British Prisoners behind the West FrontThis has been going on since the Autumn of 1916 and in most cases the treatment is brutal.   The men are starved, ill-clothed and improperly housed, and often work right under shell * fire and in direct contradiction to the agreement of the Hague Conference, July 1917.     These men are not returned in casualty lists as prisoners of war because they seldom survive.   Cases of such starvation have been known to have sucked human bones.OAPT. THE REV. A.E.; VIM, Chaplin Canadian Forces at Minden from August 1916 to May 1917 has made the following statement :-&quot;Thursday, February 16th, 1917.   At nine a]clock in the morning there arrived at the hospital at Minden 16 men. I went round to the hospital in answer to a telephone . message and saw them.   The temperature that morning was unnaturally cold, something like 100 below zero.   When we undressed these men their clothing consisted of trousers, j     tunic, thin cotton shirt, boots, socks, cap- and that was all, - no overcoats or warm underclothing.They had been two days and two nights in the train, thfy had walked 7 kilometres from the station and they were all that was left of a large force.   The men told us that it was nothing to wake in the morning and find the men beside them dead in their shelter.   One man was Pte, . .. wheeler of the Royal Berkshire Regiment, whose home
9 ft 9was at Reading.   I wrote to Reading to my WUier&quot;&quot;that night, and my mother called on the man&apos;s w$fe.   It was   I. the firs^ewe she had had of her husband although he had.&apos; been taken prisoner at Beaumont Hamel on tho 10th November, four months previously.These men are reported as missing and no further news oomes through about them.   Tbey receive no paroels and write no letters.V.   A short statement of the&apos;general, treatment of British Prisoners of war at kinden, Westphalia in winter 1916-17... &quot;&quot;&quot;*(Note:   The writer was interned at Minden from August 7th 1916 till May 3rd, 1917, and was there in the capacity of Chaplain to the British Prisoners.   Eo lived with them in the same barracks and shared their life and ia able to speak from the standpoint of eye-witness.)&quot;Minden is not to he considered a bad camp as there are many.worse, and yet Minden was bad enough.   The Commandant Major General Wolff was of that type of tyrannical German officer who has never seen active serv^ee and who was absolutely indifferent to the welfare, of the ; men under him.   The authorities did praotically nothing $o . better the conditions of life under which the interned lived.   Indeed the observation one would make is that thojp considered the jriaoners as if they were slaves, there to work, and they gave no thought to their condition or welfare.   And in fact they hindered all recreation.   Foot? &apos; ball, for instance, in the camp wa3 strictly forbidden. Jour.times only the whole winter was permission grudgingly.....   . given to go outside the camp to play.   Concerts were sorigorously censored that it was almost impossible to organise a performance.   A regimental band composed of Army bandsmen, after an existence of six weeks was deliberately broken up, the men being sent away on Command^ in several groups; this after a promise from the Commandant before the band was organised that it should be left permanently in the camp.The.re was not much work $one&apos; at Minden; it was rather a distributing centre for Commandos.   But from there in the writers personal knowledge hundreds were sent to coal mines at Langendreer near Essen, cement factory at Porta, working under terrible conditions (this factory the writer personally visited  in April 1917), and munition work.   One small party promised farm work left the camp to find themselves at a hand grenade factory.   The writer saw them on their return in a few days having been brutally kicked and beaten because they refused to work. One young soldier (?te.Jack Stuart, 4th Canadian Mounted Rifles) showed me his tunic and clothing singed and burnt where ho had been forced at the bayonets point back on to a furnace because he refused to work.Minden has a big hospital of six large wards.   Hare the chief complaint made was the total aosence of proper food and the general negleot, want of proper orderlies and male nursing staff. During February and March 1917 Russians and Roumanians were dying 10 a week.   A British Doctor was there, Capt. F. Park, Canadian A.M.G. - and he was practically prevented from carrying on his work, being confined to one ward and never allowed to go into the other parts of the oamp.(Signed) A.GILLIES TOKEN,Hon.Capt. and Chaplain, Canadian Chaplain Service.
.    7-   m.     - 6 U (j&quot;B.   C 1 V 1,1 I A N   (QerjaanyJ.......Ruhleben       Since the transfer of the 40^ cirmm^rLBr^eTB from Ruklehen; to Holland, the rest of the camp, who have ne hope of exchange &quot;Hinder the agreement of 1917, seems to Jiaye^sunk   ir^0       r. despair and mental inertia, due partly to the fact that practaoaliy ail the leaders of the camp have been repatriated or interned, in-Holland.     The most serious result of this has been the *api.d increase of nervous diseases and insanity, especially among the younger men.    ?heir whole-moral future is being endangered by   *. thfcs&apos;prolonged captivity.C.   CONDITIONS IN HOLLAND.(NOTE:   I should much appreciate that the.source of the following information should be kept confidential, as I am still working in Holland in connection with the DUtch Government.]gWd The food-conditions are very bad.  &apos; The BritishGovernment have made a contract with a company who are not honour-ably carrying out that contract.     The amount given by the Govern-ment of PI. 3.25&quot; a.day is sufficient, even, under the present food . conditions in Holland, to cover reasonable diet.     The food is however, so often badly prepared that it is uneatable, and it is always insufficient.   The men come from Germany in an ill-nourished condition needing gnod food, ad they themselves:state that they are wAr.se off for food in Holland than in Germany because they are net allowed to receive parcels and the diet is so poor that they really are suffering.     Cases of exhaustion due to insufficient food.Employment    It is extremely bad for our men to be living in. enforc-ed idleness, which is the case with about two thirds of the total&apos;, number.     The Dutch can give them practically ne employment as they have plenty unemployed themselves.     The German Government has arranged that every German should be employed.     Raw materials, such as leather, wood, etc are sent from Germany and made up by the interned in Holland;     there is also an artificial limb factory, a shoe factory, complete suites of furniture are made and shipped back to Germany, and all this gives employment not only to the men, but alsf to the officers who have the supervision of the. work, Employment is also found in this way for German civilians.With regard to our arrangements this very important department is in the hands of the Red Cross who are dependent upon the public for their funds and who therefore are not able to do   : things on a sufficiently lar^e scale to meet the needs of the men. Many of our civilians, are destitute and need this employment from a pecuniary point of view.     In this respect they were better off in Germany because they had their parcels and relief money of l6 marks a month-    Now they are receiving 10 gulden, which certainly does not go any further in Holland than 10 marks in Germany, and no parcels,.    The civilians are very bitter about their treatment by the British Government in Holland, and this great bitterness of the prisoners ( military and civilian whether in Germany or Holland ) is a grave peril, since these men had said that on returning to their homes both in the British Isles and the Colonies, they will express their resentment..The need for women  This need is very great;... The bitterness of the men has been greatly increased by the difficulties which the Government have made in allowing &quot;their wives and relatives to visit them..   The present number of women who have been allowed over from this country is..only 26 under the Y.W.C.A. and 15 V.A.D&apos;s.   German women are posing as Belgians and getting hold of the men,rand there is no doubt in my mind that this is part of German propaganda.
shoesn QMS,The following are suggestions which I feel might be of . use in considering the direot steps to be taken to remedy the -i JO conditions already described.A.   GERMANY...........&apos;     ;w.&apos;(1)        .   That in common justice the rank and filo be added in just proportion to the,exchange already arranged for officers and faC^Ors so that the privates of 1914 and 1915 would automatical-ly be released.and thus give hope to the remaining prisoners.(2) That arrangements should be made for noutrals to.visitmore, frequently all camps In Germany - small camps and working Commandos to be inolude&amp;.  ;       ,   &apos;(3) That the neutral Medical Commissions should visit thecamps, should.choose there the cases for repatriation or ,   internment, so that it should not be left to the German ,. authorities to say who should be sent to Aachen.(4) That there should be total repatriation of all internedBritish civilians.   Removal of these in Germany to Holland does not&apos;meet the case..- &apos;(5) But,even if -all these things are accomplished, little hasbeen done to ameliorate the lot of the men still left in Germany, who are-daily becoming more bitter because nothing is being done to relieve them.   It is extraordinarily difficult to know how to affect the action of those in charge in Germany. Brutality is apart of. Kultur, and they are only applying in - an exaggerated and vindictive /way the brutality ^frey apply to .  their own people.   There are,, however, two stept nhl-ok can be taken with effect;, v(a) To give constant and continuous publicity all over the world to the authentic stories of German brutality to prisoners.. This does have effect in Germany because, as peace approaches, they are. becoming more and more susceptible to the public &apos; opinion of the world.(b) To&apos; use \ German, offioer prisoners and especially their f aristocracy as the lever through which to get . proper treatment for our own privates.   The Germansdo not care what happens to their own men.   They - care very muah what happens to their own officers, .&apos; The only ,way therefore is to make it plain to them that we draw no distinction between officers and men where humanity and justice are concerned, and that unless our men are fairly treated their officer:., will suffer.B. &apos; HOLLAND ,       :. ,(8) That a food expert should be sent by the Government toHolland to look into the entire food situation *nd to improve the working of the existing contract.(7) That the British Government should make themselves direotlyresponsible for the development of industries in which all British prisoners of war in Holland could be employed.   This scheme would automatically include officers.That
-   That women should be sent over in greater numbers to Holland. They are iiedly needed and could be used for worts under the Y.M.C.A, as V.A.D. s, or in connection with social work among the men. Also that- where men have large families they should be given laave to visit their homes and that wives who have no families aiuxuXd be sent to Holland and given employment under these headings.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W., 11th July 1918.
