(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAffNIC MAJESTY13 OOVERffllENT).WAR CABINET.fle\ft$*ct Notes by Lord Curzon ofPOINTS ABOUT OUR AIR FOaC353 AT THE FRONT MALE BY THE KING W THE BELGIANS AT A PRIVATE PINNER TJITH MINISTERSON JULY10th,. 1918.(l)   Inadequte training of British pilots - less than that in Prance or Italy - with consequence cf casualties far greater among our young airmen than in armies either of enemy or of our Allies.(2)   Lack of geographical knowledge and ignorance of maps of British airmen; with consequence that wrong places are bombed, that life is sacrificed, that great resentment is caused.The King gave a number of cases in which grave mistakes had been made - (from ignorance, want of traningor stupidity) - Ke was not speaking of the occasional sacrifice of civilian life in necessary attacks upon towns containing factories, arsenals, etc(3)   Insufficient attention to reconnaissance work in the air, as compared with fighting, bombing, etc   Reconnaissance work not conducted with sufficient intelligence - notably at night.Incredible that with proper night work, using lights etc, the enemy should be able to move large forces of troops undiscovered, &quot;so as to upset in a few hours an admitted numerical balance, and to effect an overwhelming surprise.Though the superiority in numbers, machines, bravery of airmen, is on the British side, the Germans make a better use of smaller forces and are superior in the-strategy of the air.(4)   Air work from Dunkirk admirably done.(5) Bombing in general too spasmodic and scattered *   Bombs dropped Indiscriminately on ten places, each getting 1/10, does not produce anything like so great an effect as the same amount concentrated on a single object.   Objects of really strategic importance are limited in number..   Air strategy should make *      Up its mind what points are worth concentrating upon, and then   $ j     do it, instead of scattering bombs more or less at random over a number of objects,many of which are of no strategical impor-tance and none of which are seriously damaged by the mere peppering we go in for.(6)   The King spoke a good deal about the growing irritation inOccupied Belgium owing to. the action o^ur airmen, and 3aid the Germans are making great use of it for propaganda purposes.(7)   The remarks of the King, which were made in no hostile or censorious spirit, but only because he was pressed to state frankly what were tho views of almost the sole detached and impartial observer to whom we can turn seemed to call for a;       eeriouo attention.   The prime Minister has asked me to commu-nicatc them to tho Chief of the Staff of the Air for his examination.(intd.)   0. of K.JUly 13th, .1918.
