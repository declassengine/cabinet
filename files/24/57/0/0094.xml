There is also an important dispute with the National Council of Societies of Mine Workers other than Miners in Scotland.I. General Remarks.The Strike of Aircraft Workers.The strike which commenced on the 26th June at the Alliance Aeroplane Company&apos;s Factory (Messrs. Waring and Gillow) has spread during the week and has attained serious importance, 20,000 men being estimated to be out at the present time. The allegations of the men are to the effect that on the 25th June Mr. Waring called for a deputation of the workmen on the questions of the recognition of the Shop Committee and the dismissal of a female shop steward, and that he&apos; informed that deputation that he would neither recognise the Shop Committee in any shape or form nor reinstate the female steward. A meeting of the stewards, which lasted fifty minutes, was held to discuss the report. The next day it was found that their time had been stopped for two hours. This, they say, was the cause of the strike. The statement, issued by the Ministry of Munitions and published in the &quot;Times&quot; of the 9th July, describes a different case. It is there stated that the strike resulted from the dismissal of a steward named Rock, on the ground that he had blown a whistle summoning a meeting of workmen during working hours, although a previous warning had been given that meetings of this kind must not be held during shop hours.The Ministry of Munitions met the London Aircraft Committee, which consists of representatives of sixteen trade unions whose members are engaged in aircraft produc-tion. and which is the district committee of the National Aircraft Committee (itself a[1100-37] B
II. Pbess Comments.Military Affairs.A writer in the &quot; New Statesman &quot; thinks that, although the publication of the number of American troops in Europe gives valuable information to the Germans, it is justified by the moral effect. He expects the result will be an immediate and strong attack before the Americans are fully trained.Kerensky and Russia.The general impression is that Kerensky&apos;s visit is intended to obtain the interven-tion of the Allied Governments in Eussia, and Labour papers are practically unanimous in advising caution, or in opposing such action. The &quot; Labour Leader&quot; points out that he is known to be in close association with those who have little sympathy with democratic ideals. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald in the same paper lays stress on the point that a counter-revolution is brewing, which will probably be reactionary. Intervention would mean the formation of a definite pro-German party in Russia and probably civilrecognised body) on Wednesday, the 3rd July. An agreement was arrived at that work should be resumed the following morning and that arbitration should follow at 11 o&apos;clock on the same day. It was clearly understood that one of the questions to be submitted to arbitration would be the reinstatement of Rock. An independent arbitrator attended at the works, in accordance with this agreement, and it was j then discovered that the unofficial representatives of the men had induced the workmen to reject the advice of the trade union representatives and to continue to strike. The strike has since spread Avidely, and Mr. Pateman, secretary of the Workers&apos; Executive Council, threatens that in the event of no settlement being arranged, the strike will probably become national.The difficulties experienced in the recent strike in the Tredegar Valley are repro-duced in the present strike. The Shop -Committee at the Ailiance Aeroplane Works is believed to consist not only of shop stewards hut also of other representatives of the men. It is in close connection with an unofficial district organisation called the London Aircraft Woodworkers, and at the present moment both of these organisations occupy a hostile attitude to the recognised union authorities in the aircraft industry, namely, the London Aircraft Committee and the National Committee. As in the Tredegar strike, the origin of the trouble is stated to be harsh and unconscionable treat-ment by the management, the strike is managed by the unofficial committee, the executive of the recognised unions have come to an agreement with the Ministry, and the men&apos;s unofficial organisations refuse to recognise that agreement. The dispute originated in a demand of the men for recognition of their committee. It has now shifted its basis, and a struggle has developed between the London Aircraft Committee on the one hand and the London aircraft woodworkers on the other, the latter supporting the workmen&apos;s executive council at the factory.It is believed that the management of the factory are prepared to recognise the shop stewards, but are not prepared to recognise the workers&apos; executive, which consists of others in addition to the shop stewards body. If the fight were simply on the question of recognition a solution might be found. It is clear, however, that the struggle has gone far beyond this, and that the men are fighting for the principle that an unofficial and unrecognised body of workmen are entitled to assume powers of discipline and of negotiation, which have hitherto belonged solely to the executives of the recognised unions. In this struggle there is no possibility of compromise. Either the men must give in and submit to negotiations with the unions of the ordinary type, or the Government must give in and accept conditions imposed by the unrecognised body, thus weakening the position of the trade union executives. The latter course will only stimulate the revolutionary element in all unions to greater activity, and render future instances of this description more common and more difficult of treatment than such instances have been in the past. As it is inevitable that in a dispute of this nature the regular unions have everything to gain and nothing to lose from support of the Government, it is not anticipated that the revolutionary element can long main-&quot; tain the struggle, and, as was suggested last week in this report, things appear to have reached a point where even a widespread strike might prove to be a smaller evil than continued concessions to inordinate demands.
war. Mr. Brailsford, writing in the &quot; Herald,&quot; comes to much the same conclusion-All the Labour papers print a reply by M. Litvinotf to Kerensky&apos;s speeches at the Labour Conference. The Chairman allowed Kerensky to make an attack on the Russian Socialist Republic without allowing M. Litvinoff, who is its accredited representative, to reply. When M. Kerensky promises in exchange for intervention the restoration of the Russian army, able to resume the war on a large scale, this is mere political charlatanism. Is British Labour to be a party to dark schemes hatched by ex-officials of the Czar&apos;s regime in alliance with international Shylocks?Persia,A special correspondent of the &quot; New Statesman&quot; draws attention to the importance to Britain of Persian independence. The practical difficulties are however serious. The odium incurred by the Tsardom has recoiled largely upon the British, and, with the aid of enemy propaganda, has strengthened the pro-German tendency. Turkish penetration of the country is now an imminent danger, and the utmost must be done to remove all misunderstandings between Persia and the Allies, who are the country&apos;s natural friends.Germany.The Labour press sees in Von Kuhlmann&apos;s speech an opening for peace negotiations, which it hopes though without much confidence will be followed up. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; explains the vagueness of his expressions as due to the refusal of the Allies to make any statement of their intentions with regard to German colonies, while the &quot;Herald&quot; points out that no negotiator makes his best offer at the outset. M. Huysmans, in his weekly review of the German and Austrian papers in the &quot; Herald,&quot; gathers that the German Majority Socialists have accepted as a basis of discussion the suggestions made at Stockholm by the neutral Socialists. This, if true, means an important step forward, as they included the question of Alsace-Lorraine and implied restoration of Belgium at the cost of Germany.Socialism.The new instalment of articles on socialist municipal policy in &quot; Justice &quot; impresses on citizens the need for taking a keen interest in housing and town planning. In concluding his attacks on clerical influence in Socialism, a writer in the same paper says that the Church always favours a sectarian variety, which constitutes a disinte-grating factor.Councils.Whitley Councils are approved in the &quot; Sartorial Gazette &quot; and the annual report of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, which says they will be especially useful where trade union influence is strong. The &quot;Shop Assistant&quot; desires that the new Trade Boards Law should be extended to distributive trades in order to secure a minimum wage. (Labour Conference.Comments on this topic are chiefly confined to the political results. Organs of the Independent Labour party are jubilant at the success obtained by members of that party in the elections to the Committee. The &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; though cheered by this, describes the meetings as disappointing because the discussions did not deal with the war or international problems. An effort, made by the LLP. to bring forward a resolution calling for negotiations and the revision of secret treaties was not successful. The &quot; Call &quot; and the &quot; Herald &quot; agree that this conference was the most important ever held. &quot; Justice&quot; has some cynical remarks on the reception of pro-German speeches by Smillie and Williams and the applause given to M. Longuet, the chief of French defeatists. A number of papers lament that so little time was given to the discussion of the important resolutions on reconstruction, to consider which the conference was really summoned. An article in the &quot; Co-operative News,&quot; however, thinks the conference should inspire co-operators who have neglected politics too long.
III. DlSTEICT RePOKTS.Lor^don and South-E astern.The situation in this district is very unsatisfactory, and serious unrest has arisen among the aircraft workers in and near London.The main dispute, which is dealt with more fully in Parts I and IY of this report, now threatens to spread to the wood workers at Woolwich, while the metal workers at Hendon have also resolved to follow the example of Woolwich. A number of other minor causes have also led to meetings and even short stoppages in the aeroplane industry.A pacifist meeting at Woolwich on the 6th, which was being addressed by Mr. Macdonald, was broken up by men from a rival meeting, held under the auspices of the Seamen&apos;s and Firemen&apos;s Union and the Discharged Soldiers&apos; Federation, and disorderly scenes ensued, during which Mr. Macdonald escaped.The Arsenal Shop Stewards&apos; Committee at Woolwich have recently held a meeting to discuss the War Munition Yolunteer Scheme of the Government; this was regarded by the meeting as a fresh attempt upon the industrial freedom of the workers, and it was resolved to have nothing to do with it.Bouth-W estern.This district is in general calm. Discontent has, however, been occasioned at Chepstow owing to-the attempt to train men of the Royal Engineers in shipbuilding, in order to use them in the yards. To this objection is made by the Union of Ship-builders because pay is to continue at the rate paid to Royal Engineers, which is muchThe Labour Truce.The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; asserts that the delegates to the conference really wanted to make a final breach in the party truce, but the executive watered down the resolution. &quot; Justice &quot; wonders why Labour members of the Government should degrade their class by remaining the colleagues of an administration which is more incompetent, lying, 4 and treacherous than any known to Great Britain since the infamous Cabal. A similar tone appears in a leader in the &quot; Herald,&quot; which scouts Mr. Clynes&apos; assertion that Labour could not produce enough able men to form a Government.The New Party.Very little notice is taken by the Labour papers of the meeting called by Mr. Havelock Wilson to inaugurate a new Trade Union party. In the &quot; Clarion &quot;the proposal is compared to splitting a house in order to get rid of a few beetles. The &quot; Herald &quot; makes a brief reference to it, but expects that the resolution passed will be summarily rejected by the Trade Union Congress in September. In the &quot; British Citizen &quot; the new party is hailed as an avatar. The &quot;New Statesman &quot; however con-sidersthat the movement is backed by capitalist influence, both financially and in the press, and expects it will adopt a jingo election programme which may help to split the labour vote. &quot; Justice&quot; thinks that the seeds of disruption have been sown by the admission of men and women who are neither Trade Unionists nor Socialists.Lord Rhondda.The announcement of Lord Rhondda&apos;s death appeared too late for notice in most papers. Both the &quot;Herald&quot; and &quot;Justice&quot; express keen regret, and agree that Mr. Clynes is the only possible successor.Agriculture.The &quot; Labour Leader&quot; has an attack on the policy of taking men from the land. The panic about man-power in the British army is a comment on the statement recently made about the number of Americans in France. The &quot; Call&quot; regrets that the-resolution on agricultural and rural life at the Labour Party Conference received such scant attention. While not friendly to protection, the paper thinks that a return to undiluted free trade would mean the conversion of every British field and garden to a cinder-heap.
less than that usual in the yards1. A suspicion of industrial conscription has also been aroused, and the rumour is now current that the Government intend to call up the Union men, since they were unwilling to volunteer on such terms.Unrest has also arisen in the Forest of Dean coalfield, but does not yet appear to be serious.West Midlands.Reports from this area are satisfactory, and little unrest is at present evident.A meeting of Messrs. Austin&apos;s employees was held on the 7th, at which Dingley and J. T. Murphy spoke, and it seems probable that trouble may ensue owing to the firm&apos;s refusal to recognise official shop stewards, a point upon which the men insist.The Birmingham branch of the N.U.R. is starting a movement for an advance of ll a week for all men and women, and a proportionate&apos; advance for boys.Yorkshire and East Midlands.Some improvement is evident in this district, and the strike of the Castleford miners is now over.Vehicle workers in the Nottingham district are pressing for an advance in wages, and are apparently showing a determined attitude. The terms of the national award have, however, given satisfaction, as these benefit a considerable number of Nottingham tramway and vehicle workers. At Ipswich the rate of wages in the building trade is under discussion, and a conference of employers and workmen has been held at which various increases were agreed upon.Pacifism in this area has declined in favour, and at Loughborough an I.L.P. meeting was dispersed by a crowd, which consisted largely of discharged soldiers.North-Western.Considerable disturbance seems to be prevalent in this district, and the fitters at various firms are out upon a question of wages.A mass meeting of the men in the engineering and shipbuilding trades was held at Liverpool on the 3rd June at which about 5,000 were present. This meeting was called by the Mersey Reconstruction Committee to consider the question of wages. The tone of the meeting was violent, and after considerable criticism of the Committee on Production, it was resolved to strike failing the publication of the award at present under consideration within seven days. At a further meeting of shop stewards on the 7th the report of the proceedings before the CO.P. were given, and it was resolved to call another mass meeting on the 14th, and to recommend to the men that they should continue at work, but should cease all overtime, until the award is made known.A strike has begun on the Liverpool tramway system to secure the removal of certain officials to whom objection is made. Girl conductors have behaved very violently. It is stated that they are also determined to bring out the men at the municipal waterworks.The agitation in the Isle of Man has now ended upon the promise of the Governor to renew the subsidy required to keep the price of bread at 9d.Northern.Various unimportant strikes have occurred in this district, including one of boilermakers over the rates for &quot; Nod&quot; men, but no unrest of a serious nature has been displayed, and the situation is in general satisfactory.South Wales.Improvement is evident in this area, and the recent agitation has to some extent subsided.The strike of the Cardiff Corporation employees is now at an end upon the agree-ment that a Conciliation Board shall be established to settle differences.The South Wales miners, have adopted a resolution urging the Government to take the Labour Party&apos;s War Aims as a basis for peace negotiations, and to present them to the Allied Powers.[1100-37] C
Scotland.Few reports have been received from this area, and the position seems to have improved.The Women&apos;s Peace Crusade held a demonstration in Glasgow on the 30th June, at which about 2,000 people owere present. The speeches were for the most part directed against secret treaties, and a banal resolution was adopted, urging the Government to enter into negotiations for peace. An appeal against the imprisonment of John MacLean was also issued, and a protest meeting advertised. This took place on the 7th July, and caused great disorder.Dundee bakers, after remaining on strike most of last week, resumed work pending arbitration. At Glasgow the bakers have also agreed to arbitration, and it is hoped that a national settlement for Scotland will ultimately be arranged.IV. Disputes.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work.The general situation is again less satisfactory, though the number of disputes noted is rather smaller than last week.The Shipyard Labour Department reports five new stoppages of work, involving 1,062 men.The Joiners in the Wear district struck work on the 3rd owing to a demand for a good time-keeping bonus granted to piece-work trades in the shipyards. Though the employers refused to grant this, they were willing to refer the matter to arbitration, but to this course the men objected. The dispute has now been referred to the Controller-General of Merchant Shipbuilding, and the strike still continues.At Messrs. Rollo and Sons, Liverpool, seventeen engineers ceased work on the 25th June on a claim for time and a half for work on oil steamers, the weekly rate for forty-seven hours being 61s. Qd. The firm contend that the basis i&amp;. only 59s. 6d. per week. Eventually the strike, spread to.the rest of the Engineers at Messrs. RohVs, and to Messrs. Grayson&apos;s, Harland and Wolffs, and to the Cunard Steamship Company until over 700 men were involved. The. men refused their Executive^ arrangement for arbitration, but eventually upon the promise of a conference all the men resumed work on the 5th, except those employed on oil steamers, and the remainder resumed on the 6th, when the claim of the men was accepted.The Ministry of Munitions reports that 6,211 men were involved in strikes for the week ending the 3rd July.The most important of these-strikes is in the Aircraft industry of the London district, which began at the Alliance Aeroplane Company (Limited) Hammersmith (Messrs. Waring and Gillow), as the result of the dismissal of the chairman of the shop committee. It was agreed that work should be resumed on the 4th, and that arbitration should take place, but this arrangement between the Aircraft Committee and the Ministry of Munitions was repudiated by an unofficial body of men, and work was not resumed. The trouble accordingly spread to other works throughout London, and about twenty-six firms are now affected.A strike of 2,000 employees took place at the Aircraft Factory, Waddon, as a [jj^ijs     protest against the system of clocking.The War Office Contracts Department has only one new stoppage of work to report.This concerns the Textile Industry of the Saddleworth district, where six engine tenters of one firm ceased work upon the refusal of the firm to grant an increase of 6s. Qd. a week. There is some fear that the strike may spread considerably, unless immediate steps are taken to consider the grievance, as the District Weavers Association has failed to avert a stoppage.The Coal Controller reports four new stoppages; work has now been resumed in all these cases, which are unimportant.(b.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work.The Shipyard Labour Department reports forty-eight new controversial cases and &apos; 100 old ; thirty-three of these have now been settled.These disputes do not appear to be of great importance.
The Ministry of Munitions reports the settlement of the dispute with the Coke and Bye-Products Workers&apos; Union, who threatened to cease overtime and Sunday work unless they received time-and-a-half for this work. The claim for the Sunday shifts is granted, and the Coal Controller^ war wage is to be paid on each additional shift as well as on the ordinary daily shift.Dilution caused the threat of a strike at Messrs. Cox Bros., Dundee, but the women in question were ultimately withdrawn. It is, however, probable that the employers may desire to make an agreement with the A.S.E. as to dilution in the jute trade with the assistance of the Ministry of Munitions.A refusal to work overtime by the employees of the Siddeley-Deasy Motor Company has been caused by a complaint that the food which they eat is prejudicial to their health.The War Office Contracts Department reports two controversial cases.The firm of Peck and Co., Wigan, is reported to have dismissed several employees for joining the Garment Workers&apos; Union, and also to have refused to concede an increase. The case is now to be referred to arbitration. A similar complaint was made against another firm at Wigan.The National Association of Textile Unions have decided that all operatives repre-sented in the Association shall be included in the new demand for wages advances, with the exception of those whose wages are regulated by a sliding scale.The Coal Controller has no new controversial cases to report.A settlement has been effected in three old cases. He has approved a draft agreement with the Miners&apos; Federation for setting up joint pit committees. Many owners have agreed generally, but there is still opposition, especially in South Wales.The National Council of Societies of Mine Workers other than Miners is pressing hard for a grant of the war wage of 3s. in respect of a substituted shift, and has not yet accepted the agreement made with the Miners&apos; Federation. To this concession objection is made on the score that, though small, the placing of the war wage on a shift basis is dangerous, and leaves too much opportunity for further demands.The Committee on Production has heard forty-four cases in all during the week, twenty-six of which were in London. Several of these were in connection with the 121 per cent, bonus, and a claim was also heard for an advance of id. an hour in the Scottish building trade.The Chief Industrial Commissioner has had 147 new differences reported to him during the week, twenty-nine of which are claims for the 12^ per cent, bonus.G. H. ROBERTS.
