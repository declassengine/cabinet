I P      Isojj MEMORANDUMf//ALL &quot;onTHE SITUATION IN SPAIN.IN the Memorandum written on Spain on 25th April it was said that all the signs pointed to peace and quiet. The two months which have passed since have on the whole fulfilled this anticipation. The remarkable Cabinet of Prime Ministers, which took office at the end of March remains in power, has of course had no difficulty with Parliament, and has governed the country without encountering any overt difficulties or disturbances. The food difficulty, which was said in April to be the least pleasant feature in the situation, still remains, of course, but has not grown visibly worse. Spain, like all other nations, has to face this problem, which has not been rendered less troublesome by the recent epidemic ; and of course in Spain, as elsewhere, scarcity and high prices, mainly due to world conditions of supply, are often attributed to the wickedness of traders and the incompetence of the Government and the municipalities. There have been many protests of every kind of course, but they have not led to any action disturbing the peace of the country or endangering the existence of the Govern-ment. Nor has another weakness, which seemed inherent in the Ministry from the first, as yet visibly developed to any dangerous extent. The principles which divide the Spanish parties may be, indeed are, hollow or imaginary, but the opposing personal interests are entirely real. It was not to be expected that a Cabinet which included not only four ex-Prime Ministers, but representatives of the three groups of Liberals and the two groups of Conservatives, as well as of the Regionalists who belong to neither, would be a perfectly harmonious body. Many people thought it would break up at once from internal dissensions. This has not happened. It has lasted three monthsf and is still alive. More than that. In the debate at the end of April on the Speech from the Throne, the Prime Minister said that the Ministry was formed by an agreement to deal primarily with four subjects : the amnesty for political offences, the army reforms, the reform of procedure in Parliament, and the Budget. Three of these are already dealt with. The Budget remains. As to this, it is said that there is a sharp difference of opinion between Besada, the Conservative Finance Minister, who is supported by his leader Dato, and Cambo, the Regionalist leader, who is commonly regarded as the strongest man in the Cabinet. Besada proposes a humdrum Budget of the ordinary sort. Cambo, who represents the growing power of the provincial bourgeoisie, and is a practical man with a keen eye to the material interests of the country, desires to take advantage of the immense wealth which the war has poured into Spain in order to develop her resources on a large scale. He therefore wishes, it is said, for an ambitious Budget, including a considerable loan to be employed in large schemes of reconstruction, improved railway service, and other means of commercial and industrial progress. The probable solution of the difficulty is said to be the postponement of the Budget till the autumn. This plan would involve the adjourn-ment of the sittings of * Parliament, and leave the Government free from parliamentary criticism for some months.They may very well regard this as an agreeable prospect. For, strong as their parliamentary position is the oppostion seldom or never musters twenty deputies in a division-there has been criticism, and of a damaging sort, powerful enough to arouse considerable attention. The small but able and active republican group have attacked the traditional Governmental policy (for which the principal members of the Cabinet have been responsible, most of them as recently as last year) on various subjects. They have exposed the incompetence, jobbery, and active and passive pro-Germanism of the whole administration of Spanish Morocco : they have inveighed against the weakness of the successive Governments, including this one, in dealing with German propaganda and espionage, and, above all, in the matter of protecting Spanish shipping from the campaign of destruction organised against it by the German submarines : in particular they brought what was practically a vote &quot;of censure on the late Conservative Govern-[307-24],
merit for its whole handling of the revolutionary strike last August, and especially for its arrest of the deputy, Domingo, which is generally declared to have been illegal.It was this last attack which was the most dangerous to the Cabinet. Not for the support it received in the division. The motion was rejected by 129-18. But it was an attack on the Foreign Secretary, Dato, who was Prime Minister in August: it attacked him on a point on which he was admittedly rather vulnerable, and on which several of his present colleagues avowedly disapproved of his conduct: and it has, in fact, led to a more or less open coolness between the Conservative and Liberal section of the Coalition ; Romanones and his friends taking no trouble to conceal their dislike of the arrest of Domingo, Alba, and &quot;his followers, even abstaining from voting in the division, and Dato and the Conservatives not unnaturally resenting this behaviour as inconsistent with loyalty to the Coalition. The Prime Minister, Maura, concluded the debate by promising that for the future the&apos; immunity of deputies from arrest should be strictly observed, and that a judicial enquiry should be held into the allegations made by. the Left against the conduct of the authorities in connection with the August strike.It is scarcely to be wondered at that the Conservative papers accuse Romanones and Alhucemas of trying to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds, ask if their civil references to the Extreme Left mean the projected formation of a Liberal bloc, and talk admiringly of the old party system. On the other hand, these are the difficulties of all coalitions in all countries, especially when questions are raised as to past political action for which one section alone was responsible. Not unnaturally there were rumours that Dato and Besada might resign. But they have not, and there is no sign that they will. It is known that Dato entered the Coalition very reluctantly, and he has never concealed his preference for the system of homogeneous party government But the King&apos;s pressure brought him in, and most likely personal fears of causing serious offence to the King as well as patriotic fears of what might happen to Spain if the Coalition Ministry broke up, will keep him where he is, at least for the present. He must know, as well as anybody, that the. extreme men among the Republicans are inspired in their attacks on the Government by the belief that it is, as indeed the crisis of last March seems to show it to be, the last hope of the monarchical parliamentary regime, and that if they could destroy it that regime would be bankrupt and would come to an end. That is a result which Dato cannot desire, either as a sincere Monarchist and Conservative, or as a politician of the &quot; old gang K with no aversion to the loaves and fishes of office.Nor perhaps do the wiser heads among the Republicans themselves.   For the end of the present system means revolution, and it is a very long way from being certain that a revolution would place the Republicans, or any Liberal element of any kind, in power.   The p:esent Cabinet originated in the grave crisis caused by the pretensions of the army and the dictatorial airs assumed by its chosen statesman, the then Minister of War, La Cierva.   The Coalition was the only alternative to a military government under Oierva to which the King is believed for a moment to have leaned.   Cierva&apos;s exclusion from the new Cabinet was hailed with enthusiasm by every section of opinion except the most military and reactionary, and the Government was described as the embodiment&apos; of the supremacy of the civil power,   And no doubt all its members wished it to be that.   Yet it was obliged to carry through Parliament the same army &quot; reforms,&quot; enormously increasing the c: st of Spain&apos;s already most expensive and useless army (especially by increases of pay to officers), which Cierva had fallen in attempting to carry by Royal decree.   And though Maura spoke very brave words in the Cortes about his intention to crush the officers&apos; committees ruthlessly if they attempted to revive their activities, he appears to have been obliged to modify his Bill for a reorganisation of army industries in face of the opposition of the committee of artillery officers.   The truth is that outside the constitutional forces of the King, the Parliament, and the Ministers (of which the strongest in the long run is the King), there are four unconstitutional or extra-constitutional forces, the Republicans, the Regionalists, the Church, and the army, and the most powerful of these, or at least the only one that can act in a moment with irresistible force, is the army.   How to control it seems at present to be a very imperfeetly solved problem.   It possesses a very strong esprit de corps, and is, with the Church, the representative of &quot; law and order &quot; ; not at all only or always in the better sense of that phrase, but also in that made familiar to us by the precept and practice of Prussia.   It would certainly defeat the political Left if the country was thrown into a revolutionary struggle.   The only sane policy for the Left, many of whom- are the sincerest men in Spanish politics, and the men of most public spirit, seems to be to abandon the dream of revolution which has a fatal
attraction for the indolent Spaniard, who has a gambler&apos;s belief in short cuts to his desire, and to educate the country, now far too backward for such a regime as they desire, by their writings and speeches, a process which is made much easier by the increased size of their group in the present Chamber. The debates they have raised in the present session have already done something to make political discussion turn on policy and principles, and not so often on mere party intrigues. They may be in a stronger position after next Sunday, when Barcelona and other big towns are to elect extra deputies now allotted to them by a new law.What most interests us about them is naturally that they are practically to a man, and as a matter of principle, as strongly pro-Ally in sympathy as the officers of the army and the men of the official world are for the most part pro-German. We have to pay the penalty of our principles ; and perhaps we do not sufficiently realise how such phrases as &quot; Making the world safe for democracy,&quot; &quot; Final destruction of the poison of militarism,&quot; and the like, inevitably alienate the aristocratic and officer class in Spain. We have very good friends among them, like the Duke of Alba among the nobles, and General Alfau among the soldiers ; but it is not in the nature of things that the bulk of them should sympathise with the programme which we proclaim. There is the Church too ; a much older influence in Spain than the army, far more subtle and all-pervading, and one that would remain if the civil authorities broke the insolence of the army. We have good friends among the clergy ; even among the highest of them, as may be seen by the fact that the Archbishop of Tarragona has lately accepted the presidency of an avowedly pro-Ally society. But it is obvious that only the more enlightened of the priests will overcome their inevitable prejudice against the Protestantism of England and America, the anti-Vaticanism of Italy, and above all against the violent anti-Clericalism of Republican France.We have, therefore, very strong forces against us in Spain. What have we on our side ? It may be said without exaggeration or epigram that we have at once the ideas that must be victorious, and the facts that cannot for ever be concealed. Some observers who believed last year that revolution was imminent now agree that nothing of the kind is likely. But those who never thought it likely know that, with or without the Monarchy, reforms must come in Spain, and that the ideas which must guide them can only come from the Left, that is, from the one conviucedly pro-Ally section of Spanish opinion. More important because more immediately operative are the facts, because they act on all sections of the nation, and notably on the growing Regionalist party, which represents the increasing weight of the provincial middle class, with its commercial and industrial interests. The process which began with the return of capital to Spain after the Spanish-American War has gone on till, as is pointed out in an article in the &quot; Contemporary Review &quot; for May, the former control of business by foreign capital has largely disappeared; For instance, the shipping and textile business interests are now almost wholly Spanish, and the railways are rapidly being bought back from the French. This new wealth and new commercial vitality must set an increasing number of Spaniards looking round the world and asking where the future of Spain is. And to that question there can only be one answer. In Europe, as Senor Maura has himself admitted, the facts of history and geography link both the intellectual and the economic life of Spain irrevocably with the Western Powers. And outside Europe this is so to an even greater extent. The only extra-European political interest of Spain is in Africa, and there it is obvious that the countries with which Spain has to deal are France and England. Unless Germany gains such an over-whelming victory over the Western Powers as very few of her friends even pretend to expect, she will not be Spain&apos;s neighbour in Africa, now will she have any power to help or hurt Spain in that country except by permission of the British fleet. The case is still clearer in America, where history and language give Spain prestige and commercial opportunity. There, even more than in Africa, it is the friendship or enmity of the Allies, and especially of the United States and England, which can promote or hinder the advance of Spain. The future of Spain lies, in fact, on and across the seas, as was perceived by a deputy who opposed the Army Bill the other day, and added, &quot; but as big a fleet as you like &quot; ; and both the lands and the waters of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are, and are likely to remain, in the hands of the Allies and their friends.These are the facts, which cannot always be concealed. The question is, can we make use of them now ? Can we so use our present and prospective control of the commercial and political development of Spain as to persuade or compel her Govern-ment to adopt a more friendly attitude to us ?At present it must be admitted that that attitude is far from satisfactory.   It is
olikely enough that the sentments of the Foreign Minister and many of his colleagues are friendly to us, and occasionally their sentiments are translated into acts. They did at last conclude commercial treaties with the Allies ; they did at last intern German submarines, and, of late, they are doing this with a little more care and strictness ; they Have officially contradicted the German lies as to our misuse of hospital ships. But more often their good intentions, if they existed, are frustrated by the channels through which they have to pass. So we find Spanish Morocco, under a pro-German general, a hotbed of German intrigue ; we find the pro-Ally press constantly suspended if it exposes German crimes, while the pro-German press libels the Allies and remains unmolested ; we find high, public officials, as the other day at Barcelona, discovered to have acted as agents for German submarines ; we find Spanish naval officers entertaining German submarine officers and exchanging not only toasts but uniforms with them; we find pro-Ally Spanish papers being seized and otherwise persecuted for giving full details of the open and unchallenged use of parts of the Spanish coast by German submarines for purposes of rest and supplies. This last scandal has provoked the United States to a semi-official protest, and an intimation that if the States are to continue to supply-Spain with what she needs, Spain must take steps to prevent her coast being used as a naval base for the submarine war carried on by Germany against Spain as well as against the Allies,The question is whether this policy should be carried further. We have the cards : should we use them ? Many pro-Ally Spaniards think we should. They say that the temper of their country is indolent that of a waiter upon Providence. It. takes the line of least resistance. Hitherto the German Ambassador has proved more successful in using the distant menace of the German army and the actual menace of the German submarine than the Allies have been in using their control of the supplies of the world. That, some Spaniards say, is because Germany has shrunk from nothing that will bully and terrorise Spain. The question is whether, without exactly imitating these methods, we cannot counter fear with fear, especially if we combine definite threats with definite promises. We can at this moment, without waiting for the end of the war, do far more than Germany to hurt Spain or to help her development, whichever we choose. It may be worth while considering whether, either now or so soon as the immediate danger of the German offensive has been visibly met, the Allies might not jointly approach Spain with offers of help in dealing with her economic and political difficulties, with a demand for a neutrality of a more just and friendly kind, and in particular for a strict handling of German submarines and German intrigues in Spain and Morocco, and, in the alternative, with threats of a refusal of the coal, cotton, and other things, without which the industrial and commercial life of Spain must altogether cease.
