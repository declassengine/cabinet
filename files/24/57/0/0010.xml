Colonel I. Ddfy Jfon.(,; - document is the Property of I $CONFIDENTIAL.. Political Intelligence Department,Foreign Office. Russia/009.MEMORANDUMJuly 1, 191850^hl\^ onRECENT EVENTS IN TgE UKRAINESince the coup dfetat at Ki&amp;v in the&apos; beginning of May which , iOd.$o the&apos; formation of the Skoropadski Gc^srnment there has been \itSle direct news from the Ukraine apart from accounts of peasant risings all-over the country.    Until t$aV.time German polioy 4n ififr Ukraine had not revealed itself.   At Brest-Litovsk Germany   * had, supported the Rada against the Sovyets, as that provided the easiest, method of entering the- Ukraine -in search of food.    But it was a policy that soon proved impoas ibis, partly because it was not convenient to Ipe in alliance with a Peasant Republic, as was the Ukraifcfc under the Rada.Government, partly because the land pro- &quot; gramme of the Rada made it extremely difficult to collect fopa from the peasantry.   One of the first acts, therefore, of the Skoropadski Government was to abolish t$e fc&amp;ihd programme of the Rada and to restore their property to the&apos; big landowners-&apos;,A few days after the coup d*et&amp;t the personnel of the new &apos; Government was announced.   Tht ^e^4iii3tisiers were not Ukrainians but Great Russians and were mostly tlrawn from representatives of the Cadet and Octobrist parties in&apos;Kiev.   With a Government thus constituted it was not surprising that the extreme Ukrainian press was suppressed and that the- Government edicts appeared again in Russian as well as in Ukrainian,    But apart from this no clear sign was given as to whether the new Government aimed at complete independence from Russia or inclusion in a future Russian Federation when the regime of the Bolsheviks had disappeared. The inclusion of the Cadets hinted at a federal policy, but it was &apos;
2.reported that Skoropadski himself was in favour of independence. Considering that the Government was under German protection this points to a dual policy on the part of Germany until it was con-venient to decide upon a definite plan of action.Early in May reports were received from Kiev which indicated that Germany was contemplating the setting up of a monarch for the Ukraine, the object being to make Kiev the   stepping-stone to the restoration of a Russian Monarchy at Moscow.   This appears to have been the policy of the German militarist party, who locked forward to the restoration of an autocratic Government in Russia that would form an alliance with &quot;Germany.The opposition to this policy has come from two sources:-(1) The Centre and Left in the Reichstag,   (2) Austria.     Probably the two have been working closely together and have been endeavouring ^o win Skoropadski over to their side.   Skoropadski himself is a mere nonentity and would not be difficult to influence one way or the other.   The Austrians evidently made special efforts to get him on their side, but nothing has come of it and it is most unlikely that Skoropadski will commit himself to anything displeasing to the dominant party in Germany.   The German Opposition seem* to have found their chief spokesman in Rohrbach who has always stood for the separation of the border nationalities from Russia and has recently been defending in the Deutsche PcTlitik, his former views that the Ukrainians are a distinct nation whose independence from Russia should be insisted upon by Germany.   With this end in view Rohrbach and the Reichstag Opposition who have been supporting him have been in touch with the Ukrainian Socialists, including Vinnichenko, the former Prime Minister of the Rada Government.At one time during May there were indications that ,the. German Government were not openly opposing this policy, but during the
last few weeks nothing further has been heard of Austrian intrigues, and the   German military party is now having it all its own way. There are rumours that a member of the Romanov family may soon be set up in Kiev as a Russian, not a Ukrainian, Tsar.   Such a move will probably be delayed until Germany is ready.to start a counter-revolutionary movement in Moscow;   and the proclamation of a Russian Monarchy in Kiev would give a great impetus to the monarchical movement elsewhere.Austrian influence in the Ukraine may be very largely discounted.   Archbishop Szeptlcki has been active in the Austrian Interest and has been making efforts to spread Uniat propaganda in the Ukraine.   It is said that the Austrian Court, and especially the Empress, has taken a great interest In the spread of Catholicism, through the Uniat Church, both in the Ukraine and the Balkans.    The object Is to take advantage cf the present position of Russia to strike a blow at the Orthodox Church. But these efforts have met with little or no success.     Szepticki&apos;s candidate as Archbishop of Kiev wag heavily defeated, and there are now reports that the notorious Orthodox Bishop Eulogius, who acted as the proselytising agent of the Russian Government in Galicia in 1915, Is again in the Ukraine.   This can only be in connection with the monarchist reactionary movement that is being encouraged by Germany.   Austria no doubt fears the restoration of Russia under an autocratic monarchy in alliance with Germany as it would enable the latter to keep her in complete subjection in the future;   she would prefer a weak and independent Ukraine on her eastern frontier.   A significant sign of the way Austria is being ignored in the Ukraine is the fact that Germany is insisting on the inclusion of Cholm in the Ukraine, while Austria, anxious to conciliate the Poles, is doing her best to get it restored to Poland and find compensation for the Ukrainians in Northern Bessarabia.   There seems little doubt that Germany will see to it
4.that she gets her own way.Meanwhile relations between&apos; Russia * and the Ukraine are still, unsettled.   For more than two months the Bolshevik Government have been endeavouring to sign a final Treaty of Peace with the Ukraine, but owing to the change of Government at Kiev and the machinations of the Germans, to whom it is more--convenient not to have ,the frontiers between Russia and the Ukraine definitely-settled, the peace negotiations have been dragging on without any result. The Russian representatives are headed by Rakovski, the Rumanian Bolshevik of Bulgarian origin - an example of the cosmopolitan character of the Bolshevik regime.   After many weeks of negotiations an agreement has&apos; apparently been reached regarding the future frontiers.   The Ukrainian representatives made far-reaching claims including a large part of White Russia and most of the Government of Kursk, but, according to the Russian wireless, the Russian pro-posals were finally accepted at the sitting of June 22.   As far as can be gathered from the Russian account the frontiers from the West pass through the Northern districts of Volynia, the district of Radomysl in the Government of Kiev, and the Northern part of the Government of Chernigov.   Prom there the frontier runs along the Southern boundaries of the Governments of Kursk and Voronezh and through the Eastern districts of the Governments of Kharkov and Yekaterinoslav along the Seventh parallel.   The Russian delegation added that it would defend its project only in those cases where the population concerned expressed themselves in agreement with it. It was finally agreed that in the disputed areas a referendum should be taken, unddr the control of a mixed commission.The demand of the Ukrainian delegates at one of the sittings that peaceful citizens proceeding from Russia to the Ukraine should not consistently be robbed on the frontier throws an Interesting light on the conditions prevailing in this part of the world.1*7.16. t
