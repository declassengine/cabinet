j-^jjf  , &apos; Confidential.LABOUR, POSITION IN MUNITION INDUSTRIES.(3rd July 1918.)I circulate the following notes, which have been prepared in the Intelligence and Statistics Section of the Ministry of Munitions, on the labour position in munition industries.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL,I.- STRIKES.Statistics of Strikes in the Week ending the 26th June.During the week ending the 26th June, 22,802 working days or just over one-seventh of 1 per cent, of the possible working time were lost through strikes on Ministry of Munitions work. The greatest loss of time occurred on building work at the Gorse Mill and Lilac Mill Aircraft Factories, and at the works of the Fellows Magneto Co., Limited (Willesden), where 400 electricians lost five days each.Cokemen and Bye-product Workers.There has been grave danger of a refusal by the coke and bye-product workers to work overtime or at week-ends. They demand the modification of an award of the Committee on Production of the 14th February last, so that time and a half instead of time and a quarter shall be paid for week-end shifts and for overtime; and the executive council of their union has passed a resolution to instruct its members to cease Saturday and Sunday work if the claim is not conceded. Several conferences have been held, and substantial concessions in respect of grievances not directly connected with the award have been offered to the men ; but they are not satisfied and have refused the offer of a further hearing by arbitration. The action which the men threaten would affect the supply of steel by reducing the output of coke from the plants involved by about 20 per cent. If the demand were conceded the same concession doubtless would have to be made in the blast furnace trade, and also, in all probability, in all trades in which continuous processes are necessarily worked. Tn these circumstances and in view of the Committee on Production^ award of February, last, the matter has been referred to the War Cabinet, and following upon their decision negotiations have been continued with the parties with the expectation that a settlement can he reached.Symptoms of Unrest.Apart from individual and unrelated causes of unrest, two tendencies of a general nature are discernible. One is the increasing number of refusals and threats of refusal to work overtime. The second is a growing demand on the part of trade unions for the shortening of the hours of labour.Overtime.An embargo was recently laid upon all overtime by the executive of the Associated Ironmoulders of Scotland, following upon a vote of the members. At the works of the British Hydraulic Co., Ltd., Glasgow, where gas shells are being manu-factured, fines (subsequently remitted) were imposed by the union on members who had evaded the embargo. The evasion took the form of undertaking, in return for the same amount of money as before, calculated as a piece-rate on average output, to manufacture as many gas shells in the ordinary working hours as previously in theit  (33)0098  Pk 20   125  7/18  E&amp; 8 -
normal week with the addition of 20 hours of overtime. In fact, the men did better than this and sometimes actually produced as many as 260 shells per day in ordinary time as against 216 which previously had been the day&apos;s limit with overtime. The point in dispute here is that the moulders Avish the number of hours worked on each day to form the basis of a separate computation for overtime, whereas the employers require the normal weekly hours to Tie completed before any overtime is paid for. In many cases, however, the refusal to work overtime has no relation to any question about the overtime itself. It is used as a means of applying pressure without (perhaps) the illegality of a strike, and is inspired in different industries and establishments by different motives.A Shorter Week.The demand for a shorter working week is to be distinguished from the policy, encouraged by the Ministry of Munitions&apos;, of relying as far as possible upon normal hours without overtime. The unions are directing their efforts towards securing a shortening of the normal working week itself. They hope that by concluding this change during the War a tAvofold object will be secured existing rates of pay will be maintained, notwithstanding the reduction in hours, and the prospects of unem-ployment on demobilisation will be diminished. The demand for a shorter normal week has recently been put forward by-(1) A conference of Scottish trade union officials held in Glasgow at the end of May ;(2) The Leeds Engineering and Allied Trades Committee ;(3) The National Association of Unions in the Textile Industry ;(4) The Glasgow bakers;(5) The Bristol sheet metal workers; and(6) The Yorkshire Miners&apos; Federation.At the Glasgow conference the demand was for a Bill reducing the working week to a minimum of 40 hours to take effect on demobilisation; the Leeds demand was for a 45-hour week, together with an increase in pay, to take effect at once. The miners require that negotiations on the subject shall be opened immediately, but it is not yet clear whether they claim that the change shall be carried out while the War is still in progress.There is evidence that shorter hours do not necessarily entail a reduction of output.^ In the Huddersfield district, by agreement between the employers&apos; associa-tiou and the trade unions in the engineering trades, the experiment of a 50-houi&apos; working week on the one-break system without reduction of pay was recently tried. At the end of six months it was reported that output had not suffered and that time-keeping had improved. From Coventry, an investigation officer reports the beginning of a shop stewards&apos; movement to obtain, a shorter working week, but he adds that in the opinion of the local employers&apos; federation the change would be disastrous.II.-COAL  CONTROLLERS  AWARD.The Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain have put forward a demand that a similar increase to the Is. Qcl. and 9d. per day given by the Coal Controller with the approval of the War Cabinet to colliery workers above and below 16 years of age respectively, shall be granted to the other members of the Miners&apos; Federation employed in Ministry of Munitions industries. The Ministry of Munitions submitted to the Cabinet their proposals, and having received its approval are now in negotiation with the Miners&apos; Federation. Matters are proceeding favourably, and it is hoped that the miners will adopt the Ministry&apos;s proposals.* Cf. Memoranda Nos. 5, 12, 18 and 20 of the Health of Munition Workers Committee.*
