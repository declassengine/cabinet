Political Intelligence Department; July 3, 1918. Foreign Office.Russia/010.ON THE EVE OF CppTER ^REVOLUTION IN RUSSIA..The Bolshevik regime is approaching its end.   This opinion    i is confirmed by all reports coming net only from Russia direct, hut from neutral countries and from Germany *     The misgovernment of the last few months has aroused such violent, though at the same time unorganised, opposition that it is inconceivable that the present Government should succeed in coping with it.   But the growing weakness of the Bolsheviks has not &quot;been accompanied by the strengthening cf any other party.   Anti-Bolshevik feeling like anti-German feeling is deep and widely-spread, but does not take practical shape in any organisation that could take over the con-trol of the Government from  the hands of its present holders. Though it is grossly untrue to describe all anti-Bolsheviks as pro-Germans, yet the fact remains that the only anti-Bolsheviks likely to succeed the present Government are thosd who would rely upon German support.     Thus the fall of the present Government, when it comes,, will be to the advantage of the Germans and to the dis-advantage of the Allies unless the latter are themselves on the spot with sufficient strength to protect and maintain its successor.The gradual collapse of the Bolshevik regime - which during the last few weeks has been very marked - has witnessed the rapid development of German counter-revolutionary plans both in Petrograd and in Moscow.   It is probable that they are further advanced in Petrograd than in Moscow, as the control of the Bolsheviks is weaker in the former town and these who wish to conspire against them can probably do sg) with greater impunity.   Moreover, as the conditions of life seem considerably worse in Petrograd it would be natural that those who are there, looking to Germany as their only salvation
2.should be more impatient for immediate results.Officially the Germans have given no sign of what they intend to do in Russia.   They are openly negotiating supplementary terms of peace with the Bolshevik representatives in Berlin and ace giving the Moscow Government all kinds of assurances that if the peace of BrOst-Litovsk is broken it will be due to the action of Russia&apos;s former Allies and not of Germany.     If Germany shortly expects some kind of Allied intervention, it would be useful propaganda for her amongst the ignorant and bewildered masses to lay the blame upon the Allies for the renewal of a war which the mass of the people look upon with horror and detestation.   And it may be^ therefore, that Germany is still waiting for the final decision regarding Allied policy before herself coming out into the open on the side of counter-revolution.   One thing seems certain, namely, that if the Allies finally adopt a policy of intervention Germany will lose not a moment in acting herself;   if, on the other hand, the Allies delay, Germany may find that it suits her better to wait a little longer herself.   But in any case she is almost certain to act before very long.In case Germany Intervenes in Russia what forces can she rely upon and what amount of success is likely to attend her efforts? By the vast majority cf the population she is feared, distrusted and hated - by the workmen because she stands as the enemy of revolution and the upholder of capitalism, by the peasants because she upholds the interests of the landowners, by the liberal bourgeoisie because she has humiliated their country and reduced Russia from a great power to a state of hopeless anarchy.     If then the workmen, the peasants and the bulk of the intelligentsia are openly or secretly anti-German, what support can she hope to find fo any policy she may adopt?     Pro-Germans in Russia are probably very few.     They are confined to a small group of monarchists and
3.bureaucrats on the one hand and a number of wealthy bankers and Industrial magnates on the other.   Apart from the latter the bourgeoisie are probably politically undecided.   Exhausted and unnerved by Bolshevik misrule and persecution, they have lost their political bearings.   Political conceptions and conditions that at one time made them pro-Ally have disappeared in the all-pervading chaos, and their political attitude can only be determined by which side can bring them most speedy relief from their present misery. There are men with big ideas and a wide outlook regarding their country&apos;s future - chiefly to be found in the Cadet party - who have so far turned a deaf ear to any German bribes or promises, but it is hardly reasonable to suppose that these men will continue indefinitely to look to the Allies for help if, so far as they can see, none is forthcoming and If the Germans make them renewed offers which under the present conditions might be in some measure satisfactory. From private sources we learn that, though in April 1917 after the first revolution the Cadet party adopted republicanism as one of the main principles of Its political programme, many leading Cadets are now prepared to advocate a constitutional monarchy as the only form of government for which the Russian people in its present stage of development is fitted.If Germany, therefore, after occupying Petrograd and Moscow proclaimed her intention of helping to restore a united Russia under some form of Constitutional Monarchy it w^puld be difficult for the Gadets to refuse.   To refuse would bring them no apparent advantage..-They would condemn themselves to a position of impotence, having incurred the hostility of the only people with force behind thsm and having little hope of support- from the cowed and undisciplined masses.   By a wise and reasonable policy the Germans might even yet gain the support - though not the affection - of the majority of the middle and educated classes that were formerly the backbone
4.of a pro-Ally policy.But the educated classes alone fqjrm hut a very small minority of the vast masses of the population in Russia,       There remain the workmen and the peasants., neither of whom could possibly welcome the Germans or a German supported Government.   How could Germany hope to overcome the opposition of these vastly superior numbers? The workmen are undoubtedly filled with a strong revolutionary fervour and would never give place to a reactionary Government without a struggle.   But they are confined to a few big centres and are badly organised.   Germany would have to introduce troops to put them down, but with her superior discipline and organisation this would not demand any very great efforts.   She would probably adopt the same methods as have proved successful - for the time being at any rate - in Finland..     The peasants,, on the other hand, are a more difficult problem, as has been shown in the case of the Ukraine.. In a country of the size of Russia, Germany could not hope to crush peasant risings by armed force.   Isolated risings all over the country would be inevitable.,  and the anarchy in the country districts would continue in spite of the efforts of the Central Government. But at the same time with a strong Central Government some form of order could be maintained - sufficient at any rate for German purposes and sufficient to leave the Central Government in control of the main centres.For the Allies the discontent of the peasantry would only be a negative advantage.    In case of Allied intervention in Siberia,      1 numbers of Russians would flock to Siberia to escape from German control and from the appalling economic conditions which must con-tinue for some time without any hope of real improvement.      But those who would leave their homes for Siberia would not be the peasant masses.   They would consist mostly of officers, lawyers, politicians, who might rally round an Allied expedition in Siberia,
but the bulk of the peasants would remain to look after their homes *and to assert their rights to the land they had occupied.    And without the peasants no Russian army of any considerable size could be raised to join the Allies. xThere is no insuperable obstacle, therefore, to a counter-revolutionary policy on the part of Germany,   .If she has not carried it through so far, it is probably for two reasons.     In the first place the Bolshevik tyranny is rousing more am   more discontent 1 every day, and is steadily bringing fresh recruits to the German side.   Provided the Allies cannot turn this discontent to their own purposes it is extremely useful to Germany and makes the prospect of a new Government controlled by Germany less distasteful. In&apos;the second place, it is inconvenient for Germany to show her hand before the Allies havjg shown theirs.   It is clear that the difficulties confronting the Allies in any policy of intervention-are very great and it is Germany1s interest to exploit these difficulties.    If she can turn popular feeling in advance against the Allies by skilful propaganda she will have less difficulty in carrying through her own plans.It is still doubtful whether the first German move is to be at -Kiev, Petrograd or Mos^cow,     From private sources we learn that there are plans for setting up a Romanov at Kiev as the Tsar of a United Russia.   From Petrograd also there are similar reports. Tire learn that the Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich - the uncle of Nicholas II - is at the head of a monarchist movement in Petrograd Yirhich is supported by A.F. Trepov who was Prime Minister for a short period at the end of 1916 after $ firmer1s fall.     It is said that this organisation - the ramifications of vhich are not reported - sent a deputation to Ludendorff at Kovno so far back asx   This is,&quot;of course, quite apart from the local support that an Allied expedition would receive in Siberia.
May 20 and that a favourable answer was received.   Germany was to occupy Petrograd and Moscow with troops, Paul Alexandrovich was to act as Regent for Alexis, the son of Nicholas II, snd Trepov was to become Prime Minister.   Whatever the actual plan approved by Germany, there is reason to believe that Russia Is on the&apos; eve of a * counter-revolution in which Germany will play the leading role.3.7.18.
