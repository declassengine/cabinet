It is, however, necessary to point out that in the following respects it does not concede what the Miners&apos; Federation claims:(a) The war wage is not to be paid to men whose wages are, rogu-lated by an industry other than that in which they are engaged, not being I the ooal trade,This means that iron and stone miners or coke-oven men v/ho aro paid under the blast furnaoemen&apos;3 scale as is the case in certain die-trict8^,J?iIl not be paid the war wage.   The reason for this is that th^i^lnelusion would inevitably mean a claim from the blast furnacemen for a similar war wage and the introduction if confusion into the greater part of the iron and steel trade,   In consequence of the grant of the war wage to eoal miners, it will eventually be necessary either to grant in-creased prices for iron and steel or to subsidize the employers in those industries0   In either case the result will be a rise in the scale so that men whose wages are governed by it will eventually receive an advance whioh may be set off against the war wage, although it will not be oquif-vfclent to it.(b) The Committee on Production has recently heard a elaim for an advanee in wages in the olay industries as a whole.   The claim was 1 presented by all the unions concerned in tho industries, except the Miners! Federation, and is based tn an agreement such as exists in the engineering! shipbuilding and other trades for a revieipn of wages every four months. The Miners1 Federation controls a small proportion only of the men in this industry and it would be in my view improper that in respect of wages they should receive preferential treatment over,the members ,of other unionIt is probable unless the claim of the Miners1 Federation is conceded in respect of all its members, that there may be a stoppage of work extending possibly to the collieries. The Question on which the decision of the War Cabinet is desired/is wbethor members of the Miners? Federation should conform to the wage- conditions 9t the several industries in which they are engaged or whether the maintenance of this principle must be departed from in order to avert a possible stoppage ef work.   It is unnecessary to emphasize the unfortunate results on other unions c&quot; the principle that they must accept the wage conditions of the industry in whioh they work is departed from undor pressure from the Minors?

STATEMENT.

In view of the grant by the controller of Coal Mines as from 30th June, 1918, of an increase in the war wage to colliery workers, a claim has been made to the Ministry of Munitions for the payment of a similar increased war wage to all members of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain engaged in Industries in which the Ministry is concerned. These industries include the production of

(a) Ironstone.

(b) Limestone and Magnesium Limestone.

(c) Refractory Materials, comprising Fireclay, Firebrick, Silica brick and Ganister.

(d) Building Bricks.

(e) Coke and By Products.

(f) Load, Zinc, Barytes, Tin, Wolfram and Fluorspar.

The Ministry of Munitions does not prescribe advances in wages for workpeople engaged in the above, industries. Such advances require to be negotiated between the Employers and workpeople concerned. In certain cases, however, the product of these industries is sold at prices regulated by the Ministry; in other cases increased wages cannot be paid on a product essential to the Ministry without financial assistance to Employers. In such cases the Ministry of Munitions will, subject to the apporval of the Treasury, be prepared to sanction approved increases in the fixed prices or to recognise approved claims to meet extra labour costs, if the Employer shows that he has paid to his workpeople a war wage or war advance on the conditions hereinafter specified. It must, however, be understood that claims by Employers will not necessarily be entertained in respect of the whole of their product but only in respect of so much of it as is connected with munitions work for which the Ministry is responsible.

Where it has been the practise to regulate the wages of workpeople in any section of the industries above referred to according to the wage movements of another trade, not being the Coal Trade, the Ministry of Munitions will not entertain any claims from Employers based on the payment of any war wage or war advance inconsistent with that practice.

The amount of war wage or war advance which the Ministry of Munitions would be prepared, subject to the above conditions, to recognise for the purpose of the financial adjustments which have been referred to is:-

(1) In the case of Ironstone, Limestone, and Magnesium lime stone

(except in Cumberland and Furness)

men 1/6 per day

boys 9d per day

women 1/6 per day.

girls 9d per day.

as from 30th June 1917.

These amounts are based on the understanding that the workpeople have received since 17th September 1917 no war advance (exclusive of advances on account of long, service, individual merit, or regrading).

(2)In the case of lead, Zinc, Barytod, Tin, Wolfram. Fluorspar.

men 1/6 per day.

boys 9d per day.

women 2/6 per day.

girls 9d per day.

as from 30th June 1917.
Thoeo amountG arc based on tho understanding that tho workpooplo hare received slnoo 1st January 10IB no war advance (exclusive of advancos on account of long service, individual merit or, rog^adlfog)(3) In the case of Refractory Materials and Building Pricks-such, advances as -may bo-proscribed by the ponding Award of tho Oommittoo on Prediction in tho Clay Industry, as from the date proscribed in tho Award.(4) Ooko-ovOpfaw 90&quot;-bo specially considered.The working rules and conditions to be attached to the paymentof tho above advances are under consideration for each industry.
