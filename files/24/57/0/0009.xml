Confidential.Political Intelligence Department,July 1st, 1918.fxForeign Office, S.W.1. SWEDEN/006.MEMORANDUMonTHE   PRESENT   POSITION   OF   THE   SWEDISH GOVERNMENT.The 29th of May, the day of the debate on the report of the Constitutional Committee, was a red letter day for the Swedish G-overn-ment, and it is probable that never since its accession to Office has it been in as strong a position as at present,The report in question gives an opportunity for criticism of the policy of the Government or Governments which have been in power during the past year.    On this occasion there were criticisms from both the Socialist-Liberal majority and the Conservative majority in the Committee.    The criticisms of the majority were mainly directed (1) against the action of Monsieur Akermanj Minister of Warin the Swartz Government in respect of a cargo of wool oonsigned to [the Swedish Government which despite assurances given to the British SGovernment had been handed over to private manufacturersj(2) against I the ex-Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Lindman and Wallenberg.for their I share in the notorious Luxburg affair.    The Conservative minorityfor their part criticised the Aland Islands and the Finland policies I of the present Government.:The course of the debates strongly favoured the Government.    Mr. tjindman!s energetic defence of his conduct apparently carried little --eight.    While disclaiming all responsibility for the Luxburg inoi-ient he yet had, in effect, to acknowledge that he had not taken the trouble to ascertain what was happening in the Office of vftiich he was the Head.    Mr. Wallenberg1s statement on the other hand, was very fell received.    He made no other excuse than that the difficulties
both in and outside the Foreign Office were greater than anyone could imagine and he appealed to the Riksdag to take in hand the tank of the reorganisation of that department.   He expressed his regret that he had failed to inform his successor of the facts connected with a previous cypher telegram incident.   Probably Mr Wallenberg&apos;s princely donation of some weeks back of 20 million Kroner for social&apos;and   charitable purposes accounts to some extent for the great consideration shown to him.The outstanding feature of this part of the debates is the fixing of the main responsibility for the Luxburg incident on the Foreign Office proper as distinct from its Parliamentary Head. There would seem to&apos;be no serious difference of opinion in the Riksdag regarding the necessity for its reorganisation and if the eventual outcome of the disclosures is to be the opening up to the more progressive elements of the nation of what is to all intents the close preserve of a reactionary caste permeated with pro-Germanism, one of the principal obstacles to really cordial relations and mutual confidence between this country and Sweden will have been removed.With regard to the Finnish question the Conservative attacks were much weakened owing to no definite alternative policy being put forward, nor was any such elicited in the course of the debates. Not one Conservative had the courage boldly to state that Sweden should have sent an armed force to Finland&apos;s assistance, and relative to the Alands is was the time when and the objects for which the expedition was sent which were subjected to criticism, not its actual despatch which was acknowledged by Mr Hildebrand, the Con-servative leader of the Upper House, to have been desirable.Altogether one gets thd impression that the wind has gone out of the sails of the attacks on the Eastern foreign policy of the
Government.   It ts certain that the unsympathetic - to use a mild word - attitude of the Finns towards the Svecomans and Sweden has very distinctly cooled the enthusiasm of the Conservatives for the Finnish Whites and it would appear that the rout of the Bolschevisks in Finland has deprived the Conservatives of supporters in their own country who, otherwise lukewarn in politics, looked upon adjacent Bolschevism - rampant and triumphant as it at one time apparently threatened to become - as the one great peril before which all others paled into insignificance.To the justification of the Eastern foreign policy of the present Government has now been added the conclusion of the economic agreement with the West, so that we have a right to hope that nothing but a decisive German victory in the West will be able to shake its strong position.
