MINISTRY OB1  FOOD.Report for Week ending Wednesday, July 3, 1918.Lord Rhondda died at Llanwern on Wednesday, July 3rd. He was appointed Food Controller on June 15th, 1917, and thus held that office for over a year. Since Easter ill-health has caused him to be absent from the Ministry of Food, but he kept in close touch with the work of the office until shortly before his death. In the course of his administration he allayed industrial unrest by the restriction of undue profits in essential foodstuffs, and, by securing equality of distribution, he reconciled the public to the scarcity which war conditions had involved. The success of his measures was largely due to the system of decentralisation which he introduced. His fairness and tenacity of purpose gained the confidence of the public; his loyalty and courage endeared him to his staff. A month before his death he was created a Viscount in recognition of his conspicuous services as Food Controller.Tributes were rendered to his high qualities in both Houses of Parliament. Mr. Clynes sent a telegram of condolence to Lady-Rhondda on behalf of the Ministry of Food.PART I-ACTION TAKEN.Control of Supplies.Allied Requirements. Sir Guy Granet cabled that the total stocks of cotton-oil in the United States to the end of August are only 325,000,000 pounds, whereas the United States requirements alone amounted to 363,000,000 pounds, while the estimated British requirements were 70,000,000. He stated that the United States Food Administration was prepared to reduce American manufacturers proportionately, and to meet the British indent, but the conditions of labour in America would inevitably make the price unsatisfactory for British Government purchase. Sir Guy Granet has been informed that the Ministry of Food much appreciate the offer of the United States Food Administration, but in view of the shortage in America, it has been decided to await the new crop until making any further purchase of cotton-oil in the United. States. . . ,- Sir Guy Granet reports that at the request of the United States Food Administra-tion no purchases of butter have been made during the last month, and that Mr. Hoover has requested them to stay out of the market altogether at present with a view toa &apos; (33)6075-1  Pk 1   130  7/18  E k SA
preventing an undue increase in price to the American civilian population. The United States Food Administration, however, have given assurances that the necessary quantity of butter to complete requirements as submitted will be provided. A similar arrangement has been made with the United States Army and Navy.Sir Guy Granet states that on 27th June he had only been able to purchase about 50 tons of cheese as against June requirements of 5,0u() tons, as American buyers were offering considerably more for domestic consumption than the maximum price he was in a position to give. &apos; He anticipated, however, that when American trade requirements were filled there would be a surplus available for export within a few weeks.A request has been sent to New York to expedite for the Army the shipment of canned beef. ,Bacon, Hams and Lard. In order to effect further economies in transport in Great Britain an endeavour is being made to arrange that particular cuts should be shipped to particular ports. It is desired that fat bacon, for which there is a demand in the North, should be shipped to Liverpool, and that lean bacon, for which there is a demand in the South, should be shipped to Bristol and London.Cheese. 3,579 tons of cheese have arrived in this country from New Zealand ; the unshipped stock amounts to 24,705 tons, and the quantity on passage is 6,971 tons, not 6,997 tons, as was anticipated; the SS. &quot; Raranga&quot; with a cargo of 1,827 tons of cheese from New Zealand was torpedoed, but eventually reached Southampton with at least 1,428 tons of cheese in a sound condition.859 tons of Canadian cheese have arrived and 2,271 tons more have been shipped, making the quantity on passage 4,533 tons.559 tons of cheese have arrived from the United States of America, where the unshipped stock amounts to 2,662 tons; a further shipment of 354 tons has been made, 1,604 tons being now on passage.400 tons of cheese await shipment in South Africa; it is expected that 90 tons will be despatched in the middle of July.Cocoa. Owing to unforeseen difficulties it was not found possible to lift from British West Africa the 4,000 tons promised during June. The difficulties, however, have now been overcome, and the shipment of 16,000 tons will be made between now and October.   The question of future importations after October is being considered.Gold Storage. On Thursday, June 27, Mr. Clynes was present at the 19th Anni-versary luncheon of the Cold Storage and Ice Association.   He expressed his intention to stimulate cold storage work to the utmost possible extent and stated that by the end of the year the total capacity of cold storage for the purpose of preserving food ; would have increased from 30,000,000 cubic feet to 40,000,000 cubic feet.Dried Fruits. The question of future importations is being considered as a matter of policy in view of the reported shortage of fresh fruits.The Dried. Fruits (Retail Prices) Order, 1918, dated 25th June 1918, fixes maximum retail prices as follows : Dried pears and apricots     -     -     -     -     -     -   Is. id. per lb.Currants, sultanas, all varieties of raisins, dried plumsand prunes, dried peaches and nectarines -     -     -   Is. 2d.   ,, Apple rings and dried apples     -     -   &apos; -     -     -  Is.        ,,Figs -    -    -    -   -   -   -   -    - : - su     ,, :     .Meat.-The arrangements for the shipment of meat in New York have proved somewhat unsatisfactory, as there is occasionally undue delay between the arrival of the meat at the port and its being put on board. This has caused a quantity of meat to be shipped in a soft condition, which gives rise to a number of complaints from butchers and consumers in this country ; this is the more regrettable, as the quality, of the meat shows a considerable improvement on the recent inferior consignments that have been received. It is proposed to increase the meat ration to 20 ozs. as from 13th July ; calculations of supplies have been based on this amount, though it is not expected that the public will take the full ration in all districts. The methods of distributing meat are now well established, and the only difficulty that has arisen lately has been due to very low supplies of home-killed stock and a consequent high demand for frozen meat, which has taxed the transport capacity of the railways.  In
one or two quite exceptional cases it has not proved possible to deliver the full rationed quantity within the week, but this is not likely to occur again, as the home-grown stock will now come forward more rapidly.The Food Controller has prescribed eight ports as the markets at which fat cattle coming into Great Britain from Ireland must be sold for slaughter. As in the case of sheep all fat cattle consigned to Great Britain as fats will, on arrival at these ports, be valued by a Valuation Committee and taken over and paid for by a Government Agent. The Valuation Committees are constituted in the following manner : (1) A member representing the Irish interests, nominated by the Irish Department of Agri-culture and Technical Instruction ; (2) a member representing the interests of British butchers ; and (3) a Government Agent who is experienced in the valuing of cattle.After the cattle have been paid for, they will be consigned to the different distri-buting centres in Great Britain for allocation by the Ministry of Food.Milk.--Ihe Sub-Committee of Major Astor&apos;s Committee on the Supply and Distribution of Milk has met three times to consider the prices that should be fixed for milk next winter; the difficulty of obtaining reliable estimates of the cost of production and handling has caused delay in the issue, of the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report.The Agricultural Advisory Committee has met and renewed its protests against the recent calling up of skilled men from agriculture, especially as regards Scotland ; a deputation is to wait on Mr. dynes with a strong resolution on the subject, and to request him to lay it before the Prime Minister. The Committee has also sent a resolution to the War Department urging that the price of the 1919 wool clip be fixed forthwith at a higher rate than for the .1918 clip. Proposed Regulations for the sale of Calves were also approved by the Committee.The Canned Condensed Milk (Retail Prices) Order, 1918, dated 27th June 1918, fixes maximum retail prices as follows : Full cream (sweetened)     -     -   Is. 2\d. per 14 oz. net. ,,       (evaporated)    -     -   ll\d. per 16 oz. net. ,,       (unsweetened   -     -   llld.perl2oz.net. Machine skimmed     -     -    .-   Is. Id. per 16 oz. gross.Oil Seeds. The stock of oils and fats and oil seeds, expressed in terms of oil, has decreased from 311,000 tons on 30th September 1917 to 173,000 tons on 31st May 1918; 42,000 tons have thus been consumed in excess of the estimated amount of 96,000 tons. It is not considered safe to reduce the stocks any further as the minimum level is now being approached.An application has been made to the Ministry of Shipping for further freight room for tallow and copra ; these are necessary in view of the increased demand for glycerine which cannot be met otherwise, unless the diminished stocks are still further to be depleted.Poultry. Under the Rationing Scheme for the preservation of the best breeds of utility poultry, arrangements have been made in each county for poultry, keepers to hold public meetings at which a representative Poultry Committee will be nominated to carry out the work of selection.    .   -Salt. The Costings Department have sent in a preliminary report on the present prices of salt. It appears that the prices are 250 per cent, above pre-war prices, and the Costings Department consider that prices should be on an average 30 per cent, lower than they are now. The question of taking action to fix prices will be decided when the full report is received.Shipowners Provision Pool. As a result of Conferences between the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry of Food it has been decided that all surplus food brought in in spare store and cabin-room space shall be taken over direct by the Ministry of Food instead of placing it as heretofore in Pool Depots. The effect of this change will be to prevent double handling and commission charges by the Pool Agents and also the deterioration of the foodstuffs when lying at the Pools. With a view to preventing indiscriminate purchasing of surplus stores by shipowners abroad, it is intended to select particular steamship companies to carry certain commodities that are required by the Ministry of Food from time to time. This will ensure only the right class of goods being brought into the country.A 8
The Ministry of Shipping have decided that as and&apos; from the 15th July, having regard to the restrictions which are now being imposed by America on the export of food, shipments from America shall be discontinued in surplus store-room space and that future shipments shall be classed as cargo. Steps have been taken by the Ships&apos; Stores Branch to carry out these alterations and suitable arrangements have been made to take over direct surplus troopships&apos; stores and foodstuffs brought in in spare store and cabin-room space from countries other than America. Shipping demands will have priority in the disposal of these commodities and allotments will be made from time to time of controlled and other articles under the general allotment scheme of the Ministry of Food, thereby placing the ships&apos; stores trade on precisely the same footing as other trades.At a meeting of the Advisory Committee to the Ministry of Food held on Tuesday last a report from the Sub-Committee appointed by the Board of Agriculture and the Ministry of Food to draw up a scheme of amalgamation of Lord Rhondda&apos;s Committee with Mr. Prothero&apos;s Committee was considered and agreed to.The scheme involves the following main points : -(1) The amalgamated Committee to be known as the Central Agricultural Advisory Council, with the President of the Board of Agriculture as President.t(2) The Council to appoint a Chairman, Vice-Chairman and joint Secretaries, with a recommendation that Lord Selborne should be invited to take the office of Chairman.(3) The members of the Council to be jointly appointed by the Board of Agrculture, the Scotch Board of. Agriculture, the Irish Department of Agriculture and the Ministry of Food.(4) The appointment of members representing the Scotch Board of Agriculture and the Irish Department of Agriculture to be arranged after consultation with those bodies.(5) The officials of either of the above Departments to be allowed to attend the meetings of the Committee, and to speak on subjects under discussion, but not to have voting powers.(6) English, Scotch and Irish Sub-Committees to be formed in accordance with the decision of the Council.(7) The meetings to take place on the first and third Tuesdays in the month, and to be held, subject to the consent of the Council of the Surveyors&apos; Institute, in the Council Room of that body. The first meeting to take place on Tuesday, July 16th.It is understood that Lord Selborne has consented to take the position of Chairman, provided a Vice-Chairman is appointed with whom he can be in constant touch. The Committee unanimously extended an invitation to Mr. Anker Simmons to occupy that position.Organised Distribution.Additional Supplies. Applications are bciug received for exemption from Orders of the Food Controller in respect of sales on behalf of funds for hospitals, institutions for the blind, religious missions, and prisoners of war. Pending issue of general instructions these are being dealt with by Food Commissioners on the same lines as sales in aid of Red Cross Funds and Prisoners of War Committees.It has been decided to allow additional tea for harvesters so far as supplies are available.The facilities afforded to Committees formed for the purpose of entertaining American troops appear to be greatly appreciated at the Port of Liverpool, where every endeavour is being made by the Lord Mayor and a representative local Committee to give a suitable welcome to our kinsmen arriving at that port.Rationing. Sir John Miller is visiting the Channel Islands in order to discuss arrangements for bringing rationing in these islands into general accord with the system in the United Kingdom.
PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.In the Report for the week ending January 2nd, 1918, there appeared a Summary of the food position at the close of last year. The main feature brought out was the depletion of stocks during the first four months of the cereal year. It was found that this was due not to any considerable changes in consumption, but to a falling off in imported supplies, which Avas most marked in the case of wheat, maize, tea, bacon and the fats generally. In view of the lower supplies of imported meat available for civilians and of the reduced Aveight of the live stock in this country, the maintenance of normal consumption had involved inroads into the herds.At the commencement of the present year there was considerable anxiety regarding the future. Prospective supplies of Avheat, bacon, butter, margarine and meat were very uncertain and it was doubtful how the public would accept measures for the effective control of consumption. Happily these fears have not been realised. Thanks to the United States of America, imports of meat and bacon have been in excess of any anticipations, thus enabling the live stock position of this country to be substantially restored, while the heavy arrivals of cereals in the spring months haveA3It has been alleged that the1 consumption of rationed foods in the Isle of Man is considerably in excess of the rationing in the United Kingdom, and it is proposed to send a representative to the island to assist the Government in framing regulations to ensure that all possible supplies of foodstuffs are available for export to the United Kingdom.Supplementary Rationing. Returns for the period ended 15th June are now fairly complete, and show that out of a population of 33,366,009, there have been issued 3,046,926 supplementary ration cards for heavy workers, and 300,443 supplementary ration cards for adolescent boys. The total population is 39,210,84-1. and in the same proportion a figure of slightly over 3^- million heavy workers&apos; supplements is indicated. The percentage is 9&apos; .1 instead of the anticipated percentage of about 14. The only areas which reach or touch that are Newcastle with 14&apos;7 and Leeds with 13&apos;7. The issue for Scotland is only 5&apos; 6 per cent, of the relative population ; in the Inverness area only, 1&quot; 6 per cent.Enforcement of Orders.The total number of prosecutions for the week is 1,061 with 981 convictions.

rendered the position secure till the forthcoming harvest. Supplies of butter, mar-garine and lard, though fluctuating, have been such as to allow in recent weeks a rate of consumption per head practically equal to the pre-war rate. The public have accepted rationing with unexpected good-will, the best measure of which is the general desire for its extension to other commodities. The only important foodstuff in which there has been continued scarcity throughout the period under review is. cheese.The result of the foregoing is that tho general position to-day shows a marked improvement on that of six months ago. At the same time attention should be called to certain features which give rise to some apprehension : the home fruit crop is proving a failure; the scarcity of labour may imperil the results of the increased acreage under cultivation; the programme of requirements for the Allied Armies makes it extremely doubtful whether the civilian population can continue to count on any considerable supply of imported meat in the future; the prospective sugar supplies for the next few months have improved, but it is still doubtful whether they will be sufficient to cover the winter months, against which provision must be made.Imports.Arrivals of cereals in June were up to anticipations though much lower than those in either of the two previous months or than those in June 1917. Imports of oats were heavy. Receipts of meat were much higher than a year ago, and, though below estimate for bacon and hams, were above estimate for beef and mutton ; the falling off as compared with May is noticeable. Fats showed a falling off on the month, but were higher than in June of last year. Sugar was received, as in the previous month, in much larger quantities than anticipated, but arrivals were insufficient to meet current consumption. Importations of cheese during the month were again markedly below expectations, though much higher than in May and for the first month this year higher than in the corresponding month of last year.A more extended view of the position in imports is shown in the following table which summarises arrivals during the first six months of 1917 and 1918.Average Weekly Imports.

The improvement in meat (including bacon and hams) is significant, and amounts in the aggregate to an increase of 31 per cent.; since January importations have been each month heavier than a year before, and since March well above the pre-war weekly average of 21,400 tons.In sugar the increase is less marked than two months ago ; the improvement over 1917 is now less than 5 per cent, as against 25 per cent, at the end of April.The deficiency in total fats is mainly attributable to the cessation of margarine imports since March, but both butter and lard show decreases, the former of 11,000 tons, the latter of 4,300 tons.   Cheese has declined by nearly 26 per cent.The most important minor feature of the import situation during the six months has been the steady and uninterrupted replenishment of the depleted stocks of tea.For the week ending June 29th, 1918, the aggregate quantity of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs received amounted to 162,400 tons compared with 156,000 tons in the previous week, and with 312,800 tons in the corresponding week of last year (Table A). Wheat and. flour together totalled 68,200 tons against 68,600 tons in the week before, but owing to the larger proportion of flour in this week&apos;s import this apparent fall of 400 tons is converted into an increase of 800 tons. Other cereals all showed substantial falls with the exception of maize, which rose from 7,300 tons to 12,100 tons. Little rice was received during the week, but imports this year have been on a large scale, and the stock is high. The aggregate of all cereals, including wheat, was 90,100 tons, a decrease on the previous week of 13,300 tons.With the exception of cereals, imports were on the whole higher than for the week ending June 22nd. The principle increases were in meat and sugar. Of beef, mutton, and unspecified meat, 20,300 tons arrived as compared with 12,600 tons the week before, and of sugar, 29,700 tons as compared with 16,200 tons. Sugar arrivals were the largest for six weeks.Bacon and hams show little change from the previous week.There was a heavy falling off in butter and a slight drop in cheese.Consumption.Meat. The quantity of home-fed meat at the Central Market, London, and at the markets at Manchester, Glasgow, and Liverpool, was 2 per cent, less in the week ended June 22nd than in the previous week (Table B). An increase of 6 per cent, in imported meat raised the aggregate, home and foreign taken together, to a figure 4 per cent, higher than that for the week before.At the Central Market a heavy-fall, amounting to 18 per cent, in imported beef and mutton during the week ended June 29th brought down the total for this class of meat 15 per cent, below that&quot;for.the week ended June 22nd. Home-fed supplies, though&apos;30 per cent, larger than in the previous week, were only one-fifth of those a year ago.During the week ended June 22nd, for the first time for several weeks, the number of fat cattle stalled at markets in Great Britain (Table C) showed an increase on the week before. A provisional estimate gives the increase as 14 per cent., and for sheep for the same week 36 per cent.   The latter increase is seasonal.Bread and Flour. The consumption of bread and flour in the United Kingdom as shown by returns of bakers and retailers.of flour for the four weeks to June 22nd was in the aggregate the same as for the previous four weeks, and 3 per cent, greater than in the corresponding four weeks of 1917 (Table F.). Last year there was a decrease of 5 per cent, from May to June. As in the earlier months of this year it was significant that the shortage of supplies of meat, bacon, butter and margarine did not lead to any marked increase in the consumption of bread, so it is equally significant that with the improvement in the supplies of these commodities the consumption of bread should have fallen with the approach of summer by a smaller percentage than in the corresponding period: of 1917, when fluctuations in supply were of little moment.   The steadiness of the index since November is remarkable.With the exception of Carnarvon, where there was a heavy increase, there were no great changes from May to June in any part of the country (Table K.). Whereas last year nearly all the. Divisions recorded heavy falls, this year the only marked declines were in Leeds and London, amounting to 5 per cent, and 3 per cent, respec-tively. The absence of any general reduction in consumption is probably to be attributed to the improvement in the attractiveness of the loaf..   A 4

The quantity of fish passing through Billingsgate Market during the week ending June 22nd was the same as during the previous week. The average weekly figure for June was 1,919 tons as against 2,259 tons for May, a fall of 17 per cent. ; from May to June of 1917 the weekly average rose from 2,149 tons to 2,580 tons, or 20 per cent. From April to May there was an increase of 5 per cent, this year and of 24 per cent, last year.The average weekly arrivals at eight other important inland markets this year have in the aggregate increased from 1,399 tons in April to 1,694 tons in May and again, in the first three weeks of June, to 1,788 tons.Stocks.From the 1st to the 22nd June stocks of butter rose from 15,400 tons to 20,500 tons, those of lard from 13,200 tons to 17,900 tons and those of cheese from 7,900 tons to 10,200 tons. During the same period stocks of bacon and hams increased 9,800 tons to 71,600 tons. Other meat was in the aggregate practically unchanged. Fish rose from 20,900 tons to 25,100 tons.Pending the issue of the results of the census of June 4th, the Board of Agricul-ture has made its regular monthly estimate of the number of live stock in England and Wales (Table G.). In view of the undoubted depletion of the herds and flocks which existed at the beginning of this year the figures may be claimed as very satisfactory. While the numbers of older cattle are down, the herd as a whole has been restored to the level of last year. The total number of sheep are about 1,000,000 less, but this is partly due to -the unfavourable lambing season in 1917. An encouraging feature is the increase in the number of sows kept for breeding; given an adequate supply of feeding stuffs there is a prospect of restoring the pig population to the normal level.Wholesale Prices.The price of English Cheddar cheese has again fallen and is now at 164s. Od. per cwt., 13s. Od. per cwt. lower than a fortnight ago. Oats has fallen to 46s. 4ii per quarter, thus losing most of its last week&apos;s increase.
