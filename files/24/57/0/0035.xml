This Order was in continuation of a previous Order (of 32/5/18) by which tfte Board took possession of a portion (2032 acres) of the Ben Damph Beer Forest for the purpose of letting it to these oroftere for grazing of sheep.Under Paragraph 6 of Part II of the Act the Board have issued an Order presorlblng 3 months from the date of the decision as the period within which the Central Agrioul-Hural Wages Committee nay disallow a decision of a District Wages Committee fixing a minimum rate of wages.The Board are arranging with the Food Production Department, London, for the supply of 25 Royal Home Canners and a proportionate number of cans for use among fruit and vegetable growers in Scotland.    In this connection the Board have asked the Food Production Department to send one of their skilled instructors to conduct a oouree of inetruct-:ion in the use of the Home Canner, the course to be held in Edinburgh and to be attended by representatives of the Agri-:cultural Colleges in Scotland,    One Canner and 6 gross cans are being sent for demonstration purposes to the East of Scotland College and also to the West of Scotland College,4. Supply. oT Fertilisers.The Board continue to be fully occupied in the work of allocating fertilisers, issuing special licences etc, in accordance with the terms of the recent Fertilisers Order.Owing to the demands of the Ministry cf Munitions and having regard to other considerations ( e,g. the supply of labour at fertiliser factories) the Board have decided to allocate the quantity of Sulphate of Ammonia available for the period June to August 1916 for mixing purposes only, except such small quantities as may be required for immediate application to growing crops.    Merchants, dealers and co-operative societies have been Informed of this decision,fa m&amp;izM wwy.iThe position with regard to the supply of labour for industries allied to agriculture and also for harvest work is oauoing great anxiety and urgent representations have been made by the Board and the Ministry of national Service to the War Office for the temporary release of soldiers from the Army.6. Supply of Agricultural Machinery.During the past wecfc arrangements have been oom-:pleted for the supply to District Agricultural Committees OfBinders /
Binders to be used with Tractors and horses during this season&apos;s harvest. The Board have been able to secure a reserve supply of binders over and above the requirements intimated to them by the Committees so that Committees will be in a position to undertake any urgent demand for securing the crops which may result, from unfavourable weather conditions. Delivery of a number of these binders has already been given and it is expected that all machines will,be allocated before the end of this month. The types, to be used are "McCormiok", "Massey-Harris" and "Albion" and the total number of machines ordered and delivered is 200.

8. Supply of Grain Sacks for 1918-19.

Further enquiries have been made regarding the supply of grain sacks for the coming season. At the recent Conference with the North British and Caledonian Railway Companies particulars were obtained of the present stocks held by the various Railway Companies in Scotland and of the number of additional sacks ordered by each. All over, the stocks of railway sacks will be increased by about 14 or 15 per cent, but it appears to be clear that the provision made by the Railway Companies is Scarcely adequate. From returns received by the Board it would /
would seen that the total yield of grain in Scotland will &quot;bo about SO per cent greater than in 1917.    All this additional grain will he surplus grain on the farms for which transport will require to he provided.     It follows, therefore, that although the total yield of grain nay be increased by SO per cent the percentage increase in the amount to be carried by tho Railway Companies will La very much greater and cannot safely be placed at a lower figure than from 3 0 to 40 per cent.As stated in a previous report private traders have, during the,past few years, relied to an increasing extent upon the Railway Companies for their supplies of sacks.     The Hoard consider, however, that the Companies have made a reasonable effort to cope with the prospective abnormal increase in the demand in the coming season, and that accordingly the Companies are entitled to expect from private traders a proportionate effort.     A circular letter has therefore been addressed to the-principal corn factors and merchants urging them to add to their private stocks of sacks and offering assistance in placing and obtaining delivery of orders,COLLECTION OP STATISTICS A TD RETURNS KEATING TO AGMCTOUBP RKTUiTO, UNTO. THE POTATOES (GROWERS* FffTUBNS). QHDFR. 1917.The tabulation of the Returns for 1st June has now been completed, and a summary table is appended showing the results.    The quantity returned as consumed or delivered during Hay, viz., 47,077 tons, is about half that returned as consumed or delivered during April.   This is the final return under the Order.     It will be observed that stocks were practically exhausted at 1st June.It has now been decided by the War Cabinet that the arrangement made last week regarding the recruiting of agri-:cultural workers in England and Wales shall apply also to Scotland, viz., that oaliing-up notices, if issued later than 26th June, or if the envelope containing the notice bears a post-mark of date later than 26th June, shall be cancelled and that no further calling-up notices shall be issued until after the harvest.The number of men actually posted towards the quota of 5500 men up to 2nd July was 5016,The Board continue to receive numerous representa-; ions both from individuals and from farmers&apos; associations and unions regarding the serious effect upon agricultural work of the calling-up of skilled men,     Grave apprehensions are expressed in many quarters regarding the prospects of the, harvest.  OTTI^JP^^17omeh!s Institutes have recently been formed at Spean Bridge, Inverness-shire; Rosehall, Sutherland; Arra-:doul, Cornhill, Lcngmanhill, Rathven, Tianffshire; and Luthrie.

28th in Edinburgh for the purpose of fixing the constitution Cf the Institutes in Scotland.     It was decided that an annual conference should be convened by the, Board.
