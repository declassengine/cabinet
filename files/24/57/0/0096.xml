D/H3/1211.WW.   .Colonel 1. Dally Jones,SopSUMMARY OP BL OdJgADE IBP ORMATI ON fO 5th - 11th July, 1918.231GEfflltAL EMPIRES *   There is now convincing evidence that the reoeatfrosts in tho Central Empires ana the droughts whioh preceded them have seriously retarded the 1918 harvests throu$iout the Central Empires.    The areas affected in Germany include Prussia, Pomeranla. Silesia, Saxony, j3rundenberg, Mecklenburg, Oldenburg, Thuringia. Hanover, Brunswick, Bavaria, Baden and the Upper Rhine provinces. The areas affeoted in Austria include large portions of Hungary, Galioia, Bohemia and Moravia.    The cereal crops will ripen at least a fortnight later than was expected and will be generally inferior to the crops of last year.    The potato crops-will be deficient and the potato harvest will be late.    The vegetable and fruit crops will be below normal.     In Austria the harvest prospects are worse than in Germany.    The German and Austrian Governments were relying upon the harvests in Hungary to relieve the position at an early date, and late harvests in Hungary and Galioia must clearly upset their calculations.   The position in Galieia is especially serious and during the next two months the local population and many refugees will need relief.    Bad weather in only partly responsible for these conditions in Galicia.    The Authorities have allowed large areas to go out of cultivation and they have requisitioned oows in milk and considerable quantities of agricultural machinery., RUSSIA.    H.M.Government are considering schemes for resuming trade with lorth Russia and Eastern Siberia.   Steps are being taken to as-oertain what goods are required, what arrangements oan be made for their distribution, and what supplies can be made available for the United Kingdom in compensation.j,, DEMARK. The negotiations for a new German-Danish Commercial Agree-ment are now proceeding. lew prices will be fixed for German coal and for Danish butter for the period Aug. 1st to Dee. 1st. la order
&apos;to aaaist Denmark against German pressure in these negotiations H*M. Government are oonsidsring whether it would be possible to ship to Denmark various consignments of iron tubing stored in the United King-dom for Danish aooount;   also whether it would be possible to supply Denmark with certain drugs.    The Danish Government would like to be able to inform the Germans that H.M. Government do not intend to raise the price of British ooal to Denmark.    H*M. Government will, however, be compelled to insist upon an additional charge of 10 Kr. per ton for British ooal owing to the high prices asked for Danish butter.     It is estimated that Denmark is now spending over Kr.300,000/ 000 annually on ooal.   German coal is now 30 Kr. per ton oheaper than British ooal and the ouality is not greatly inferior.   The price of British ooal is at present 62 Kr. per ton f*o.b. as compared with 8 Kr. per ton before the war.I OR WAY.   The Germans have informed the Norwegian Oanners who work for Germany that they do not propose to import more than 2,000 tons of canned fish of the 15,000 tons allowed to them under the Horwegian American Agreement, and that they will infuture supply only a limited number of canning factories with raw materials.   The Germans intend to take the balance of the 15,000 tons in herrings.The German Charge d*Affaire at Qhristiania has formally notified M, Ihlen that the Geiman Government are prepared to grant safe conducts to Norwegian shipping generally on condition that the vessels are not transferred to Allied services and that they are employed exclusively in purely Iorwegian trade and do not sail between Allied ports. The lorwegian Government have been formally invited to send delegates to Berlin to negotiate an agreement on these lines.M. Ihlen states that the Norwegian Government are not in any way committed to these proposals, and he has promised to inform our Minister of any further developments.IETHERLMDS. On July 4th, H.M. Government withdrew their objections to the sailing of the Dutch oonvoy proceeding to the Dutch East Indies.
(Phe convoy accordingly sailed on July 5th,A letter from the Netherlands Government offering to resume nego-tiations for a general Agreement will shortly he delivered to H.M. Legation at the Hague.     Sir W. Townley understands that the rations proposed by the Allies for Dutch imports from overseas have been ao-oepted and that our finanoial suggestions have been adopted.   The question of Dutch exports to Germany will, however, be full of diffi-oulty.    The Hotherlands Government will press for permission to export fats-and hides to Germany in exchange for German goods.   Exports of fats and horses are even now taking place and the Germans are believed to be asking for 200,000 cow hides in compensation for German coal. H.M. Government understand that the Dutch are also contemplating the following exports to Germany:-Cheese ..... 2,000 tonsPotatoes ... 40,000   &quot;Milk....... 1,500   &quot;Fat........ 1,000   &quot;Fruit ...... 40,000   &quot;    during the next three months^Vegetables.. 30,000   ,T    per month.Eggs are going to Germany at the rate of 2 to 3 million monthly; small exports of poultry and meat offal still continue, and large ex-ports of jam and sugar have recently taken place.   Further exports of cattle and horses are also contemplated.We have drawn the attantion of the United States Government to . these exports.    It appears that the United States Government are not in any way committed to the proposal noted last week that supplies should be offered to the Dutch under a modus Vivendi pending an Agree-ment.    They are now reconsidering the matter with special referenoe to the question of Dutch exports to the enemy.Sir \U Townley has formally protested to the Dutch Government against the systematic disregard of the Agricultural Agreement by the Netherlands    Uitvoer Maatschappij (Export Centrale).   Since the N.U.M. took over the execution of this Agreement from the Landbouw Export Bureau they have in many instances ignored it entirely or
interpreted it to the advantage of Germany.   They have sanotioned the export to Germany of cows in oalf and they have sent large quantities of sugar and of sugar in Jam and marmalade to Germany without setting aside the quantities of sugar due to the United Kingdom or required for the manufacture of condensed milk for the Allies.   They have ex\ ported greatly increased quantities of eggs to Germany without taking&apos;&apos; any steps to provide a quota for the United Kingdom.   They have also neglected to furnish H.M. Government with statistics of the actual exports from Holland of Dutch produce.   The H.U.M. have invariably sheltered behind the Netherlands Government when we have protested against these breaches of the Agreement.   m are representing that, if the N.U.M. cannot be induced to fulfil the Agreement for which they accepted responsibility, future negotiations between the Dutch and British Governments will necessarily be compromised.   We also ask that no further exports of sugar, Jam or eggs be licensed for Germany till the arrears due to the United Kingdom in respect of these commodities have been delivered.tWITaKRLAMD.   There has been an exchange of views at Berne between the representatives of the Swedish and Swiss Governments regarding the transit trade between the two countries through Germany.   Sweden de-sires to send to Switzerland minerals, iron, steel, cellulose, etc, and Switzerland desires to send textile fabrics and chemical products to Sweden.   The German Authorities require all such goods to be trans-shipped at the frontier and forwarded by German firms who exact a heavy commission.   They are systematically   impeding the transit of, s neutral goods which German firms are themselves able to supply and they only grant facilities for this transit trade to firms which had business relations with the Northern leutrals before the war.   They are evidently anxious to prevent (a) the development   of any new trade between Switzerland and Soandinavia and (b) to prohibit firms which work for the Allies from participating.     In retaliation theI Allies will henceforth refuse all applications by German firms in

A large proportion of these contracts expired in May md have not been renewed,   There are aose  50 Swiss factories wording for Germany, employing about 40,000 men.   M* Hoffmann has protested on behalf of the firms concerned to the German Legation at Borne, but without re-suit.   Many of these factories have erected opooial plant &quot;and allege that they have not yet covered their initial expenses.   The Germans have offered to place with them orders for peace articles, but it will take time and money to adapt the workshops to a new class of work,Y* QtixmM SUBMAiilfla BLQ^Dtf,    The following is a summary of thelosses to aisrohant shipping, due to enemy activity, which were reports od in the period July 5-11, inclusive,   Smacks and trawlers aro omitted:-Steamships   (500 tons gross k over)-British ,,,.. ,29,259 tone gross Allied &amp; Neutral    16,061   n      11(100 tone gross &amp; over)British . * s * * * * * Allied k leutral 95 w .2,264   &quot;Grand Total47,879 tons grossTotal British 9,554 tons gross-o0o---H.W, OAitLbiSS DAVIS.War Trade Intelligence Department. 12th July 1918*
