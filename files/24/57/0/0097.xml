WAR CABINET.G.T. 6096.   foC &quot;     r**PROGRAMME&apos;OP DEVELOPKEM1 OP THE ROYAL AIR FORCE.(Copy of letter go. B.96 from Secretary, Air Miniatry. to Secretary, War, Cabinet.)Air Ministry,Strand, W.C. 2*10th July, 1918.Sir,I am commanded by the Air Council to forward, f*r the information of the War Cabinet, particulars regarding the Programme of Development of the Royal Air Force, and tt request that these proposals may be laid before the war Cabinet as an urgent matter for decision.The policy if the new&apos;Air Staff has recently been explained in detail in a paper forwarded to the War Cabinet on July 9th, 1918.-/ Briefly, it is to expand those portions of the Air Force acting in co-operation ivith the Navy and Army so as to ensure the.present decree ef superiority over . the enemy and, concurrently with this, to build up a really effective air strategic striking arm.   The matter is one of great urgency in View of the importance of establishing a strongnucleus at the latest by October of this year and of making the necessary arrangements in regard to material and   -personnel.&quot;&apos;-&apos;- , - - - -r^-;:&apos;/-;&apos;&apos;&apos; .\To achieve this end, and to carry out. the v/hole policy, it is essential that the. War ^cabinet shall agree to allow the priority asked for as&apos;regards men and material to meet Royal Air Force requirements or. as .will be seen from the attached correspondence with the Ministry of ^rational Service, the Air Ministry will not be .in a position &quot;to accelerate Air Force development..As regards material;/the Mini.s_t.ry. of......Munitions has .been consulted and states that, provided priority is saner tioned for aircraft requirements-and that.ample deliveries of Liberty motors are obtained from America, it will be possible to carry through the programme necessary to give effect to the new policy.As regards organisation within the Royal Air Force, the way is clear and all necessary arrangements are in hand.   Further, it is anticipated that by re-organisation and adjustment, the aerodrome programme already sanctioned may be made, to suffice.War Cabinet sanction was given (War Cabinet 361, Minute 7, dated March 7th, 1918, dealing with Lord .: Rothermere!8 Memorandum G.T, 3727) for a total of 240 squadrons to the old R.P.C. and for doubling the R,N.A.S.$ G.T.5076.The Secretary, War Cabinet,Whitehall, S.^. 1.
at equal date up to a total estimated at 52 squadrons, thus making an existing sanction for 292 squadrons.   These sanctions applied to squadron^ of an average establishment of 18 machines,   the new proposals for which JunctionJ*s^ requested represent an addition of 48 squadrons and&quot; that&apos; all squadrons should be placed on an average establishment if about 20 machines per squadron.   This change is made to effect increased,efficiency of personnel.Great efforts are being made in retf-vrd to the re-organisation of training units, etc, etc., in order to ensure economy in the use of existing personnel.It ia essential that if this broacl policy is to be oarried into effect such saacjfeio^mustJbe ^iven at once for material and personnel, without detailing &quot;the exact character and allocation of the new squadrons.   A separate paper on this subject is bein/;: submitted, but as this&quot;second paper will involve very full discussion it has been considered &quot;advisable to confine the present one to the bulls requirements for immediate settlement.I amSir,Your obedient Servant, (Sgd.).   tt.A.&apos;R0BIE30H.I.Copy of letter Kb. A.?;/C*475l, dated 7th July, 1918 from Secretary, Air Ministry, to Secretary, Ministry of&quot;&apos; Hational service.Sir,I am commanded by the Air Council to transmit herewith for information of the Minister of $rational Service estimates of requirements of personnel for the development of the Royal Air Porce programme from 240 to 340 Squadrons by the 30th September, 1919.The estimates are based on the assumption that the formation of the squadrons will be re,ailar and systematic, and proportionate month by month.   The figures Shown are based on the recruitment of personnel four months in advance of the dates of the formation of units to allow of their necessary training.*The fibres of the attached estimates apply only to the expansion of heavier-than-air units and mainten-ance of existing li -Jiter-than-air units, no provision is made for expansion of the lifter-than-air units.I onSir,  -Your obedient Servant,(3*d.) w.a. ac^irsor.The secretary,Ministry if Rational service, Hotel Windsor,Victoria Street, S.w, 1.
