*    [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.  July 1918.NAVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION-No. 59. Week ended Qth July, 1918.NAVAL OPERATIONS.Mines have been laid in the Heligoland Bight and in the northern approaches to the North Sea Dover Straits.On 30th June some of our coastal motor boats operating to the northward of Terschelling Island attacked enemy submarines and minesweepers, and one sweeper is believed to have been torpedoed. All our boats returned safely and we suffered no casualties to the personnel, but two seaplanes which were co-operating were lost owing to engine -failure.On 4th July three of our large America seaplanes, from Felixstowe and Yarmouth, engaged enemy aircraft in the North Sea, and claim to have shot down one enemy monoplane and forced down one biplane. All our machines returned safely, but one of them was wrecked whilst being towed in at Pelixstowe.On 6th July the submarine C25 was attacked by enemy seaplanes about 25 miles east, of Orfordness.   She was damaged, but was taken in tow subsequently by submarine E51 and has been docked at Harwich.  The commanding officer and five men were killed by machine gun fire.In addition to reconnaissances and patrols which have been carried out in various Flanders areas by R.A.F. machines employed on naval duty, the following raids have been made Area, bv our machines from Dunkirk : Date.June. 29th-30th30th30th June-lst JulyJuly 1st ...lst-2nd2nd4th-5th 5th5th . 5th-6thObjective.Approximate weight ofbombs dropped.Stahillebrugge Dump Zeebrugge......Engel Dump........,Bruges Docks...     ......Maria Aelter, Varssenaere, Vlisseg-hem and Ghistelles AerodromesBruges...     ..........Zeebrugge    ......,Zeebrugge, Ostend Docks, La Bru-&apos; geois Works and Ghistelles, Maria Aelter, Thourout, Wyngene. and Vlisseghem AerodromesBruges......Ostend Docks, &amp;c.......Bruges Dock ...     ...     ......Ostend Docks        .........Ostend and Zeebrugge      ......Total weight      ......Tons. 6211*3 46 2Results observed or remarks.11-1271 tons.Bursts among sheds and on railway sidingsthrough middle of dump, A direct hit on electric power station.

*Mediter-raneaii.Indian Ocean.In the course of aerial fighting during the above raids six enemy machines were destroyed and ten driven down out, of control, and two of our machines are missing.During the night of 29th-30th June, Bergues Aerodrome was bombed by eight enemy aircraft considerable material damage being caused, but only one man was wounded.On 30th June the submarine E21 sank a merchant vessel of about 2,000 tons in a position three miles from Capocesto (Dalmatia). The survivors were picked up by an Austrian torpedo boat.On 1st July five Allied machines from Taranto attacked Cattaro, about a ton of bombs being dropped. Four bombs were dropped on submarine headquarters, and a fire was started in a ship alongside the submarine quay. One of our machines landed at Valona with engine trouble, but the remainder, returned safely to their base.The Senior Naval Officer, Zanzibar, reports that the British garrison of King&apos;s African Rifles for the defence of Kilimane, having advanced with the Portuguese to Nhamakurra, has been cut off. The light cruiser.&quot; Talbot&quot; has, therefore, landed some marines, with two maxim guns, for the defence of Kilimane, where there is practically no garrison, and&quot; the sloop &quot; Rinaldo &quot; is taking the marines up the river. The General Officer Commanding-in-Chief has been asked to relieve the marines as soon as possible.ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.Submarines During the week under review about 15 large enemy submarines have been located, operating, included in this number being.two of the converted &quot; Deutschland &quot; type. The chief zone of activity was the western approaches to the English Channel as far out as Longitude 10o W., and from, the Channel itself several reports of enemy attacks have been received. The Irish Sea was free from submarines throughout the week and activity off the north-east coast of England was much diminished, only two submarines having been located in that area.Actions The following Table shows the number of actions between Allied craft and enemywith enemy submarines which are reported to have taken place in all waters during recent weeks, submarines. an(j ^ne nature of the craft which have been engaged; and also the number of submarines which have been destroyed as the result of such actions: *	Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		June 15th.

(The tonnage lost this week was mainly employed in non-United Kingdom trades, only three vessels of over 500 tons engaged in United Kingdom trades having been sunk. The percentage of losses to sailings in all Overseas trades in the week under review was only .81 as against 3.23 in. the previous week. There were no losses either in Cross-Channel or Coasting trades, and reckoning all United Kingdom trades together the percentage of losses to sailings is .24 as against 1.29 last week.The Table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all merchant vessels, Foreign Areas as well as British, sunk, damaged and unsuccessfully attacked in the last two weeks by in which enemy craft and by mine, classified according to areas. vessels lest.It will be seen that during the week under review there has been some increase of enemy activity in the English Channel, but&apos;the Irish Sea has again been clear of enemy . submarines.  During the last three weeks, only one submarine attack in the Irish Sea has been reported,, and that an unsuccessful one.The number of British and Foreign merchant vessels sailing in organised Convoy Vessels which completed their voyages during last week, and the losses sustained whilst in such convoyed, Convoys, compared with corresponding figures for previous periods, are as follows: 	Weekly average April, 1918.

ENEMY MINES.Minelaying. A new group of enemy mines was located during the week under review of Berwick-on-Tweed, and necessitated restrictions in the use of the War Channel between St. Abb&apos;s and Berwick. Further mines have been swept up in the area to seaward of the East Coast of Scotland; the probable object and possible line of extension of this minefield is being carefully investigated and arrangements have been made for systematic searches for further mines in this region.Casualties. .

No enemy ships have entered Rotterdam, men-but two have left and have arrived at Harlingen.(0 1283)        &quot; - A3
FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. Russia.There is no change in the situation at Murmansk, where the local Soviet has agreed to all the Allied wishes. General Maynard is at Kandalaksha, which place it is proposed to hold, and it is hoped in the near future to enrol a sufficient number of the inhabitants of the district to push forward and hold Kem.Mr. Lindley and staff, with Admiral Kemp and several members of the Economic Mission, arrived at Archangel on the 4th of July. The landing was made without any hostile demonstration, and at a meeting with the President of the local Soviet and some members of the Food Supply Committee, the question of the repatriation of Allied refugees was discussed. The Russians claimed the right of withholding visa from civilians wishing to leave, and of ordering their return into Central Russia if the Soviet so desired. They further reserved the right to exclude all foreign men-of-war and merchant ships.At a conference held on board H.M.S. &quot; Suffolk &quot;at Vladivostok, on 27th June, it was decided to request that the vessels of the Siberian flotilla should be disarmed, and to guarantee the safety of the lives of the crew ; a few days later disarmament was effected.AdriaticOn the night of 2nd July, while reconnoitring in the Gulf of Venice, Italian T.B.D.&apos;s sighted enemy destroyers. The Italians opened fire and claim to have hit, whereupon the enemv turned back towards Pola.  The Italian vessels were undamaged.West Africa.One of our warships, which has recently visited Fernando Po, reports in reassuring terms on the situation,.and that there need be no apprehension of immediate danger from the German troops interned in the island. From previous reports it was feared that the German native troops, numbering about 6,000, had been allowed to retain their arms and ammunition, and that they might attempt to return to the Kamerun. It is now believed, however, that the number of rifles in the island is very small and that they are entirely in charge of the Spaniards, who apparently have the situation well under control.Naval Staff,llik July, 1918.[Appendices.
