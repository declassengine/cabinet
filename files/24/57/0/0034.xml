BIOCKADE IH?0?.I.tATIQN,Juno 28th - July 5. 1916,-* pBHlfARKt     The proposals of the Danish delogates at V/ushington forrestricting the exports of Danish produce to the Central Empires(vide Summary:   June 14 to June 20) are virtually identical withthe Danish proposals of February last.   We regarded these propos-als as inaoceptable and nothing has happened sinoe to change ourviews.   We are recommending the United States Government to sano-tion no imports of fodder or fertilisers into Denmark and toinsist that the surplus Danish produce shall he equally dividedbetween the United Kingdom and Germany after neutral requirementshave boon met.   If the United States Sfar Trade Board insist uponthese terms the negotiations at Washington will probably be unsuc-cessful - a result whioh apparently would not be unwelcome to theBoard,   It seems to be their intention to make no further ooncea-sions to Denmark but to prolong the negotiations until they event-ually break down altogether,H,M, Minister at Copenhagen reports that owing to theeffect of drought upon the Danish harvest the number of cattlebrought into the Copenhagen market during the week ending June 17thwas twice as large as in the previous week.it is reported that a group of prominent Danish businessmen are planning an Organisation which will supervise the purchasefof all supplies required by Denmark from overseas.   The Organisatio will determine what supplies are necessary and what prices shall be paid.   They will distribute their orders between Germany and the Allies according to the state of the market.   The Organisation hope to be able to control oargo spaoe on Danish ships in aooord-anee with their import programmes., Inter-SOAIISIIIAVIAN TRADE,   negotiations are pending between the
Danish and Swedish Governments for a renewal for ftmr months of the existing commercial treaty &quot;between tho two countries.   The present treaty expires at the , ond of July.   Tho Scandinavian countries have considerably developed their inter-Saandinavlan trado oince tho first mooting of the Scandinavian Ministers in March 1915.   This trade Is likely to remain a permanent feature in their economic policy.   Conferences &quot;between the three Scandina-vian countries have resulted in, the formation of permanent i   committees for examining their respective resources and arranging suitable economic exchanges.   The Danes are finding a market In Norway and Sweden for their agricultural produce (at present l?or-way and Sweden are taking more than half the Danish &quot;butter surplus). Norway offers fish, saltpetre, minerals arid chemicalsi   SwedenIoffers timber, wood, tar, wood pulp, metals and horses.   To an increasing extent Finland is being brought within the range of this Inter-Scandinavian trade.InSTHTiRIiAlDS. Further difficulties have arisen regarding the convoy which the IJetherlands Government are sending to the Dutch East Indies.   The Caiman dyes have been discharged, tout it has since I    transpired that Mr. Loudon1s assurance that no other cargo of German origin was being&apos; carried by the convoy did not apply to the naval and military stores consigned to the Dutch &quot;East Indian Govern-ment*   Some of these stores, in particular some consignments of * j   wireless apparatus, are said to be partly of Dutch and partly of German origin.   We are insisting that all materials of  enemy origin shall be removed;   and, if the convoy sails without our being pre-vlously satisfied that no such cargo is on board, it will be stopped by our patrols.    It was announced in the Dutch press on July 2nd that the convoy would sail on the Allowing day.   Sir W. Townley immediately asked whether the report were true.   Mr. Loutfon
replied that 8/s &quot;Hoordara&quot; was leaving on July 3rd and that the rost of tho oonvoy would Bail on July 4th.   The Netherlands Government had concluded that, as tho Gorman dyes had boon removed, there could be no further objection to the convoy pro-oeecUng.   Sir f. Townloy intimated that if the convoy sailed without the formal consent of H.I1. Govornmont the Netherlands Government might find themselves confronted with a situation of the utmost gravity.The continued delay of the Dutch Government in concluding a general Agreement with the Allies may have serious conoequenoos. The Germans are taking advantage of this delay to press for con-cessions which may make it impossible for Holland to prohibit or restrict her exports to Germany in accordance with the draft pro-posals which were accepted by the Dutch delegates in the London conferences of last Doc ember.   V/e understand that the Germans are endeavouring to obtain Dutch hides in return for coal and other commodities from Germany and we have already boon obliged to pro-test against the export of Dutch horses to Germany ta breach of the Anglo-Dutch Hides Agreement.      Sir W. Townloy has been instruct ed to warn the Netherlands Government at his discretion that if they delay ma.king an&apos; Agreement with the Allies and continue mean-while to sanction exports to Germany which would not be possible if the Agreement were concluded, the Associated Governments will reconsider tho rationing; of Holland in tho light of Dutch oonces-slons to the Central Empires.   H.K. Government deprecate a proposal put forward this week from Washington that the Associated Govorn-ments should furnish Holland unconditionally with a two months supply of a number of essential commodities.    Sir W. Townloy does not think that this concession would affect the political situation in Holland and he fears it might postpone a general settlement.Representations to this effect are being made by 1UIU Government to the United States Government.      The United States Government
are apparently disturbed to find that the requisitioning of Dutch shipping by the Associated Governments is   still resented in Holland, and they are anxious to make amends,* ARGM1OTA.   The Argentine Government recently intimated that they are willing to renew their convention with the Allied Governments for the purchase of the Argentine cereal surplus.   H,M* Government are not disposed to arrange for further purchases   of cereals, beyond&quot; those covered by the existing convention, until more definite information has been obtained as to the supplies likely to be available for export to Europe from the United States during the coming year,   Argentina will have no market for her cereals unless the European Allies agree to take them, so that there Is iiQ immediate need for a convention,   She Norwegian and Swedish Governments have arranged to make their purchases of cereals in Argentina through the Inter-Allied Wheat Executive,   The Spanish Government will make no further purchases in the Argentine until they have previously discussed them with H,M, Government,   for the present the Spanish Government have secured   all the cereals they are likely to require,GS3E1AI STJBMARIKS BLOCKADE.     2h0 following is a summary of the losses to merchant shipping, due to enemy activity, which were reported in the period June  8 - July 4, 1918 inclusive.
