SECRET.From Viceroy, Foreign Department, ]st July 1018. (Repeated lo Tehran and Baghdad.) (Received at India Office, 6.30 p.m.)Tehran lias doubtless informed Foreign Office of report that eneniv have occupied Abadeh (own and telegraph office, that all. South Persian Llifies have deserted, and that British officers and Indian troops are holding out in barracks. Telegraph north ol Abadeh is cut. There are about 14 British officers and non-commissioned officers and 3 platoons of Kith Rajputs in Abadeh. Thoy have provisions for one month and plenty of ammunition. Dehbid with 2 British officers and I platoon of Rajputs is presumably also invested, as is Shiraz whence Ave have had no communi-cation since 18th dune. Early relief from Gulf side is impossible. (Jommander-in-Ohief therefore is telegraphing to Baghdad, repeating to War Office, asking whether .Dunsterville&apos;s force can despatch a force in cars to relief. But there appears to us little prospect of such force, even if available, arriving in time or being adequate to deal with what appears to be widespread rising. Only hope, now unfortunately but slender, of averting serious catastrophe which must involve Avar with Persia, appears to lie in getting Persian Government lo move energetically in the matter and to send messages by telegram and thence onward by urgent messengers to tribal leaders to cease hostilities pending a settlement. Effective co-operation of Persian Government can only lie secured by real conciliation, of more genuine character than that contemplated in your telegram of the 29th June.
