Memorandum &quot;by the First Commissioner of &quot;orka,, . (Previous papers G.T.4805,.G.T.4998 and GoT.5023),Mr.. Roberts&apos;&apos;proposed amendment in the terms of the Fair Wages Resolution of the. House of Commons of the 10th March, G.T.4805  1909P is I think essential if the spirit of the Whitley Reportis to guide the contracting Departments in their relations with . the industrial World..    There cannot be, as that Report aims at, industrial harmony and efficiency in a trade if employers are at liberty to pay less than a fair rate of wage when engaged on private work while being compelled to pay a fair rate on their public work..    A rate is either fair or it Is not,    neither the original Resolution nor the proposed amendment bets a high standard but merely a reasonable one: and I am convinced that much trouble and expense will be avoided by the adoption of such a dofinite and straightforward line of action as that suggested by Mr, Roberts.Contractors with two standards of &quot;fairness&quot; in their dealings with their workpeople will probably have two standards in dealing with the Government,, and the knowledge that this is actually the attitude of many firms has necessitated in the past a constant watchfulness and supervision by representatives of the Departments.It is inconceivable that with the introduction of local or Shop Committees, District Committees and national Committees or Councils, as recommended in the Ehitloy Report, there should be possible two standards of fairness in regard to rates of pay and conditions of labour.    Better rates for better work there will always be, but something less than 1 fair&quot;rates for something less than fair work is not practicable in the present industrial conditions,I can state from personal experience since I took Office that the Fair Wages Resolution as it stands at present is difficult to administer and leads to endless disputes with the Unions.    Mr. Roberts1, amendment would have been very desirable even in normal times: in the present state of industry I hold it to be essential, and I would urge that it be adopted by the War Cabinet.and pressed in the House with&apos; the full strength of the Government behind it,  \ 3!his is not a case of yielding to undue pressure from one clasa at the expense of another class: it is a case of recognising frankly that a grave defect exists in a formal Resolution of the House of Commons which does not express what most of its members undoubtedly intended it to mean at the time and a determination to remove that defect..Personally, I would go further,than Mr, Roberts in order to eliminato the clement of doubt which exists as to what constitutes a &quot;fair1 wage.     I should recognise as fair only auoh rates as have&apos; been agreed upon bot?/eon representative Associations of Masters and Men,, in essence the recognised Trade Union rate.
t&apos;18.M.Office of Works. 9th July, 1918*I havo found the whole question of this Resolution most unsatisfactory, loading to distrust and disputes., and compelling Government Departments to go on dealing with firms whoso general rato of wages is anything &quot;but fair on their own work.     It is high time that the Government beoarno a &quot;Model Employer&quot; leading private enterprise, rather than a laggard timidly following behind progressive private capitalists&quot;.&apos;(Signed).
