IS DOCUiiuFC IS TffH! PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT AM IC MAJESTY&apos;S. GOTONMOfl!)Vdth reference to Var Cabinet 417, Minute1 11, on the subject of general Aerial Policy the following paper prepared by the Air Ministry, and agreed between the  &apos; Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry, is approved by the Chairman and is circulated as the final decision of the Air Policy Committee on this subject.CABINETC R E T. 5076  /2.      CERTAIN----------/ ^   momMem or andurn, by the Air kinistry.(signed)   Leslie Wilson,Secretary, Air Policy Committee.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.v\ July 10th, 1913.
The Air Force .duly came into existence on the 1st April. 1918.   On my taking office on the let May, no definition of general polioy regulating its conduct had ae yet been laid down, although certain principles had been agreed, defining the responsibility for the operations of Air Force Units allocated /the Naty and Army.I desire now to submit for the approval of the War Cabinet the following observations setting forth what I conceive to be some of the main responsibilities and duties attaching to the Air Ministry at this stage of the War.In the first place, I assume that the decision of the War Cabinet to constitute the Air Ministry together with the Air General Staff was based on the conviction that the possibilities of aerial warfare and their   influ-snce on the war, might more efficiently be, realised by the establish-ment: of a single authority    than by the maintenance of independent forces attached to the Navy and Army, and in particular, that a rapid development of aerial forces;. devoted to the interruption of German industrial effort and kindred objects, might be achieved to such an extent as substantially to contribute towards bringing about a definite demand for peace.   To attain success in this policy, the Air Ministry must therefore &quot;be recognised as the authority on general air policy, except as. regards operations forming   .. part of naval or military operations *   It must act with the advice oLf. and in the closest liaison with the. representatives of the Kavy and Army as regards the needs of these two Forces, and.accordingly the Air Staff must command, the fullest knowledge of all methods of the utilisation of air-craft and their effectiveness in practice.Hitherto, practically all aerial operations and the , utilisation of all aerial resources.have been carried, out under the orders of naval or military commanders, ano/to an overwhelming extent such operations have been in fields of aerial activity directly associated with naval and. military efforts.   Artillery co-operation, ground target worjii tactical bombing,. photographic work, anti-aircraft, machines carried by warships, seaplane carrier units, escort and anti-submarine patrols, 1-aval reconnaissances by use of aeroplanes and seaplanes and the use&apos; of torpedo-carrying aeroplane work, represent definite funotions of aerial work associated at present with Naval and Military operations.On the other hand, long and extreme range bombing machines for operation by day and night, utilised against targets outside the range of machines designed for the,., above;functions, involve for their efficient utilisation operational considerations of a purely aerial, character, and require for their conception and execution a large measure of freedom and independence from other military schemes. &quot; i
One factor which continuously tends to complicate the true war policy, arises from the evef-growing series of functions and classes of activity to which aircraft might toe applied with success.    This results in a series of continuously growing demands oh the necessarily limited aerial resources of the country.   Whether these resources are assessed in aeronautical material or in personnel, their rate of development is continuous, hut as shown hy experience, such growth wili todt equal the rate of demand, although, fortunately, the development should take place at a greater rate than that of the enemy&apos; s aerial resources.In these circumstances, I Buhmit the following proposi-tion for approval.-(i)   The Air Ministry is responsible to the War Cabinet for securing that utilisation of the available aerial forces of the country which will prove most effective in its results against the enemy, with the limitation that the operational control of the Forces allocated to the Navy or the Army rests with those Departments respectively.(ii)    This responsibility involves the power of allocat-ing the resources as between the iavy, Army and Air Force, and, in the event of a conflict of opinion as to forecast allocation arising owing to the forecast resources being below the demand of the three Authorities, the Secretary of State for Air, after consultation with the First Lord of the Admiralty and Secretary of State for War, must be the Judge, subject to appeal .to the War Cabinet. Once an allocation is made in forecasts it can&apos; tnly be altered by consent subject to timely reference to the War Cabinet for a ruling 3hould emergency arise... (iii)   A programme of the establishments of different units and of their provisional dewltpment will after consultation with Admiralty and War Office be regularly submitted to the War Cabinet based on the following con-si derations of war policy :-(a)      The most effective strategical result8will beobtained in the different spheres of activity toy continuous and progressive measures rather than Desolated and non-continuous operations, except .where such operations are of a justifiablyopportunist character, or alternatively, hold ,   substantial and definite potentialities.(to)      Large permanent establishments, unless continu-ously reviewed, tend to tie up resources, encourage hidden reserves, and prevent mobility and temporary, concentration when such might toe invaluable.(c) The allocation to the present Western Front Army approximates to the maximum demanded on a well considered programme extending to J&quot;une, 1919.(d) The necessity of quickly strengthening the anti-submarine aircraft patrols is clearly recognised,
1 %R1 0 u(sd)   W. WBIK.;Air Ministry,(e) The continuous bombing of German industrial, centres, presents very important pd8sibiliiiee,t and valuable results may be achieved by the use] of even a small force commencing to operate how.&apos; and by its rapid progressive development.(f) It is to be recognised that the Air Forces oper-a&apos;tOii independently by ihe Air Minis!try-t, are M , a certain extent mobilej and their availability is,, elastic, e.g. if the Army cr Navy has dome veicy important and temporary objective to attack by aircraft, and:their&apos;own,permanent eataolish-ment is unable to:deal-with it, they will be in a position to apply to the Air Ministry, who may dotach temporarily sufficient resources to carry out the.operation desiredi but such Forces will be under,the control of the Air Ministry for re-aliocation.   Such specially detached Forces will usually be operated under&apos;the Admiralty, or War Office,&apos; but. in.exceptional circumstance^.:i, they;. may by agreement.with the Admiralty or War Office be operated by&apos;the&apos; Air Ministry.
