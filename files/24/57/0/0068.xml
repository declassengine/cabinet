E N E M YALIENS.G.T.5067VimORMmi BY TUB HOME SECRETARY.00o00i have read the report and recommendations of the members of the house of commons appointed by the prime minister to investigate the enemy alien question and to report to him.i agree with the statement of the report that much public anxiety exists on this matterj   but i think that it is largely founded on a misunderstanding of the facts.     the report itself shews that even members of the house of commons who take a special interest in the alien question are imperfectly ao-qvainted with what   is now being done, and i think it probable that the public anxiety would be removed by a frank statement of the precautions whioh have been taken and of the results obtained.i proceed to deal with the recommendations in their order:-1, it is noticeable that the committee do not adopt the popular cry &quot;intern them all&quot;, but recommend that exceptions be made where there is definite national or medical reason for exemption.     these word3 would cover exemptions from intern-ment granted to persons of friendly nationality, to invalids, and to persons engaged in work cf national value and requiring special skill;   but they would probably not cover the exemptions granted to alien enemies who have lived many years in this country, have married british wives, and have sons serving in the army or killed in action.    it has been the policy of the government hitherto to grant exemption in such oases on the recommendation of the advisory committee presided over by mr, justice sankey;   and i am not aware that in any case the privilege has been abused.    but a considerable period has elapsed since the exemptions were granted;   and i think it desirable, ospecially in view of the public feeling on the matter, that all exemptions should now be carefully and drastioally revised.     no attack has been made on the advisory committee;   and i am disposed to think that the revision should be carried out by the same committee, which might be strengthened by the addition (say) of two members of the committee appointed by the prime minister.     the committee might perhaps be asked before considering a case to publish the name, and invite information from the public;   and they should be empowered to impose conditions, e,g. to prevent competition with british traders,i see no reason why the committee should not be required, when they advise exemption, to state their reasons, and i think these might be published,i do not think it necessary to require every claim for exemption on the ground of ill-health to bo certified by three doctors.     this might be left to the discretion of the committee.2, the recommendation as to adult female enemy aliens contains nothing now, but represents the existing practice.     it is noticeable that in the case of women (though not of men) the committee recommend that weight bo given to considerations of &quot;justice and humanity&quot;.
3. I see no objeotion to the revision of all certificates of naturalization granted to enemy aliens since the 1st January, 1914;   and words to that effect could be inserted in the Bill whioh I have introduced.    None have been granted since 1916. . &apos;-   &apos;-&quot;4, This would be effected by my Bill,5, I see no reason for this.    If n,ny subject of a neutral nation who has been naturalized since August  1914, comes under suspicion, his case can be dealt with under my Bill,6, The same observation applies to this recommendation.     I think confidence can be placed in our Intelligence Departments,7. The expression &quot;enemy origin&quot; is-ambiguous;   and I am not sure whether it is* intended to cover a case where.(say) one grandparent was German or Austrian. If 30, the carrying out of this recommendation would coat the State some good public servants.8. All cases of alien enemies in prohibited areas were reviewed a short time ago by a Committee consisting of Sir Alan Sykes M.P. and Sir Louis Dane.   Their report was presented to Parliament, and was considered satisfactory,     I think this recommendation harsh and unnecessary.9. I do not understand this recommendation.    Alien enemies are not allowedto visit prohibited areas, and other persons of enemy origin or association.donot require a pass,   .10. By Article 25 A of the Aliens Restriction Order, 1916, no alien enemymay change his name during the war except by permission of the Secretary ofState,     It would be difficult to extend this Order to all &quot;persons of enemy * . norigin , . .11 &amp; 12. These recommendations do not concern my Department.13 &amp; 14. I do not know on what grounds these recommendations are made.     The oamps are well managed, and the regulations generally follow the Array regula-tions.     They must necessarily vary in different camps.15. Strict supervision already exists over neutrals employed on all ships calling at British Ports, If it can be shewn that stricter supervision is necessary, it should of course be applied,G.C.   .9th July, 1913.
