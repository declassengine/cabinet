^^&apos;J-^^S;^; BOARD OP AflBICULTUK3 AND ?IBH3RI3B./Report for the &quot;reek.ended 9th July, J2JfijuLand Division.Small Holding ColoniesHeath Hill.   ^The entire staff has heen engaged for the whole of the week with the hay harvest, and as a result of overtime a satisfactory woekfs work has been done*    Up to dato 209 acres of hay have beau out and I7 fc carted.    As the com crops will be light on the average it is hoped that sufficient labour will be available to deal satisfactorily with the corn harvest.Zs^M5l^*    ^llQ horses are still busy   doing carting, earthing up the potatoes and hay carting, and have just commenced spraying crops..    Women and other labourers have been busy hay making and weeding amongst the various crops.    The cattle are going on satisfactorily.    SO more pigs are being sold this week.    The mares and foals aro doing well.    Haymaking has heen finished under the most favourable conditions;   a good crop having been secured in excellent condition.Kelham Estate.The Committee are considering tho future policy with regard to the land on the Estate not already in hand, amounting to 3,695 acres:   all this land is held under agreement until 6th April 1919, at which time the farms and iand will automatically fall in unless some arrangement is made in the meantime.    Under present conditions the land is undoubtedly not being farmed to the&apos; best advantage, and careful consideration is being given to the question as to advisability, from the farming and factory stand-point, of allowing certain tenants to remain.    The farming operations are following their normal course:   hay making is almost completed, from 500 to 600 tons having been carried and stacked up to date.Tithe, Copyhold, Commons, and Survey Branch.During the past week two applications for Altered Apportionment, two for redemption and one for merger have been received, while one Altered Apportionment, six redemptions, one exchange of glebe land under the Tithe Acts, and four enfranchise-meats of copyhold have been completed.    Written and verbal communications received show that, as a result of the increase in the value of tithe rentcharge, and, pending the announcement of the intentions of the Government as regards legislation on the subject, landowners in some parts of the oountry are withholding payment of tithe rentoharge.    Other landowners who desire to redeem the tithe rentcharge which they pay are not proceeding in the matter because they take it for granted that a new Act will be passed this Session containing provisions for redemption on a basis more favourable to them than that prescribed by existing legislation.Joint Committee of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Ministry of Eood.The Joint Committee has received during the week reports from several Representatives urging the necessity for organising instruction to be given to those farmers who have not had any experience in arable farming, in the best methods of ploughing and cultivating their land.    One report received from a district
olose to London states that practically all the land in that part consists of grass farms and, as it is generally considered to he some of the best hay-growing land in England, the general practice has-, been, of late years, to cut and sell the hay and graze stock* &quot;Everywhere in the district&quot;, it is stated, &quot;the Agricultural Committee is met with the extraordinary ignoranoe of the farmer as to how to plough and oultivate his land.    Prom the standpoint of&apos;&apos;*:&apos;&quot;&apos; food produotion, suoh farmers are really nothing but hay growers and stock raisers&quot;.    The failure of many of the oropefrom newly ploughed grassland is oausing considerable discontent.A Meeting was held at Warminster on the 6th instant under the auspices of the local branch of the Farmers&apos; Union.Pig Produotion Section.Inquiries show that a good deal is being done by some of the Urban Distriot Councils in the neighbourhood of London to encourage pig keeping, but the Ilford Council are not giving the facilities asked for and they    --are.1   being pressed to do so by the Board. An offioer of the Seotion attended at the opening of a piggery at Croydon and spoke at a subsequent meeting.    The oorrespondenoe suggests that the great diffioulty at present is obtaining feeding stuffs and that there is also a difficulty inprocuring material for the construction of sties.    Complaints as to Local Authorities refusing to grant permission for pigs to be kept are comparatively few.Ordnance Survey.During the week 64,581 maps were sent Overseas, 9,475 to the Admiralty. 3,156 to the Royal Air Force, 6,428 to the War Office, and 3,304 to Other Services.Publications Branch.The number of applications for ordinary issues of the Leaflets was 3,777, in response to which 4,849 copies of Leaflets were     ;   despatched.    In addition, 31,674 copies of Leaflets were despatched to applicants for supplies in bulk for distribution.Veterinary Research Laboratory.The Chief Veterinary Officer and Director of Veterinary Research reports as follows on louping-ill in sheep:-&quot;Louping-ill is a destructive disease of sheep which renders large tracts of sheep land unprofitable and in some oases impossible.    For the last thirty years this disease has been the subject of investigation by various committees appointed by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries and by other agricultural bodies throughout the country.    The last committee of investigation appointed by the Board of Agriculture reported in 1906 and the expenses of investigation Incurred by this Committee amounted to about four thousand pounds.    It is a curious thing that no advance whatever regarding our knowledge of this disease has been attained by any of the various committees which have dealt with the matter;   the reason being, I think, that they began with preconceived ideas and pursued these to the exclusion of investigation of the natural facts obtainable when closely studying the disease in the field.    I took up this disease at the laboratory a few years ago, but my work was unfortunately interrupted at an important stage.    I am fclad to report now that the continuation of the investigation has resulted in practically a complete solution of the problem.
.i 218The results amount afc.^ oause,1* (2) the jiisewrnr^yot&apos; the melhoa-Ot&apos; spread, (3) the discovery ofthe metaocL. of infection, (4) the discovery of a useful method of pierentive inoculation, (5) the elaboration of a praotioable jaeinod of eradication, and (6) as regards curing animals once \hey are affected,&apos;that this seems possible, but   further investigation is required.&quot;The results, 1 think, are all the more gratifying since the methods of cure, prevention, and eradication will not -  require anything of the nature of restrictions on movement which are so irritating to stock-owners.    They can, in fact, be applied by farmers themselves with no more assistance than a campaign of direction.   I venture to think that this will be of considerable importance in schemes of reconstruction as regards sheep farming.&quot;Fisheries Division,.Admlnlstrative.,Seoti on.    Plans- of protective works- intended to prevent , the passogeof boal&amp;up and dewn the fish pass at Chester V/eir have been completed and formally approved, and questions affecting fish passes at two other YIeirs have also been dealt with.    An Inspector is now enquiring into questions which have arisen in connection with the working of the salmon trap at Varkworth mill dam on the River   1 Coquet.    The calling up for military service of V/ater Bailiffs employed by Boards of Salmon Conservators is likely to cause difficulties in some districts:   the Board are making representations in the matter to the Ministry of National Service in connection with two Bailiffs employed in the Usk Fishery District.     Complaints have been made by the Felixstowe fishermen of the narrow esoape from damage to boats and orews by machine gun firing from British aeroplanes:   the complaints were found to be substantiated, and the local Air Station Authorities are holding an investigation.Permit Section.    Permits have been issued in respeot of .17 fishing vessels, and 21 permits have been cancelled.    A report has been received and communicated to the Admiralty of attacks on Grimsby fishing vessels by enemy submarines, in the course of which two motor fishing boats were sunk, all the crews being saved, and one steam trawler damaged, with a loss among the crew of two men killed and one wounded.    The recent restriction of trawling in the Dover Command has been modified and the increased area now allowed has been notified to the fishermen.Kotor Loan Committee?     The work of installation at Shoreham andFolkestone goes on still without intermission.    At the former port another boat was completed during the past week, and arrangements have been made for two more boats to come to Folkestone for installation, as soon as the mechanic there is ready to attend to them.-     The Committee have been successful in making arrangements for the construction of new fishing boats and surprisingly good progress has been made with the first of these, considering the scarcity of ship-wright labour and the difficulty of retaining or replacing the few skilled men that can be found,-,  - The prooess of securing the retention of men is slow, and recently a day of valuable work was lost while a ship-wright-was reporting himself at a distant place only to find that his call had been deferred, but no noti-co to that effect had been sent him.
received from the Admiralty urgent :e rivets for drafts 01 men i,w supplied as quickly as possible, the drafts already supplier. pe*iig considerably less as for the United Kingdom as a whole than the requirements.    It has been arranged to supply 300 men, tho procedure being specially shortened to admit of early enrolment in Section &quot;T&quot;.    When the respective oontributions of England and Scotland have been finally determined any excess numbers furnished by England and Wales will be compensated by the reduction of future calls.The normal work of the Board proceeds on lines as indioated in previous.
