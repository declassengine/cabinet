[June 27, 1918.]Political intelligence Department, Foreiun Oeeice.Moslem Countries /003.MEMORANDUMonPOLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN RUSSIAN CENTRAL ASIA SINCETHE REVOLUTIONS[This P.I.D. Report is a resume of events in Russian Central Asia since the outbreak of the revolution in March 1917, and should be mainly useful as a paper of reference. ii.  Pluvious Conditions.RUSSIAN Central Asia was incorporated in the Russian Empire between the years 1863 and 1885, and was then divided between two systems of administration: (a) the Governor-Generalate of Turkestan, consisting of&quot; the Trans-Caspian, Samarkand, Syr-Darya, Ferghana, and Syemiryetch provinces, and administered as an integral part of the Empire; and (6) the autonomous Khanates of Khiva and Bokhara, which, like the Native States of India, were in a treaty relation with the suzerain Power and administered their own affairs (subject to the control of a Russian Resident at each Court and of the Government at Petrograd), though they had no independence in questions of railways, tariffs, or foreign policy. B,In 1911 (when the last, estimate was made) the population of both areas together was about 8,500,000 6,500,000 in the Russian provinces and about 2,000,000 (though this figure is very uncertain) in the autonomous States. Of the total about 3,000,000 were nomads or semi-nomads (Kirghiz in the north and Turkmans in the south-west), 5,000,000 settled Moslem peasants and townspeople, and 500,000 Russians. Something less than a million of the settled Moslems were Iranians (akin to the Persians and Afghans), the rest Turkish-speaking strata, deposited by successive invasions. The Islamic civilisation of all these settled elements was deep-rooted, though barbarised by unsettled conditions, especially during the three centuries preceding the Russian conquest. The Russian colonists&quot; (who had only come into the country during the last-generation) were chiefly concentrated in the province of Syemiryetchensk where the Russian Government had founded a Cossack community and pursued a policy of systematic agricultural colonisation and in the city of Tashkend (234,000 inhabitants in 1911). Tashkend, the administrative centre of the whole Governor-Generalate, as well as of the province of Syr-Darya, was considerably the most important urban community in Central Asia, and the Russian colony there was subject to the same social and political influences as the inhabitants of other large&apos; Russian towns. The special conditions at Tashkend have had an important and rather a disastrous effect on the course of events in Central Asia since the Revolution. For the Russian atmosphere of Tashkend is something exceptional in Turkestan, and the other Russian centres for instance, the colonies along the Trans-Caspian Railway are of minor importance.When the revolution broke out, the Russian conquest, recent though it was, had already revolutionised economic conditions mot only in the centres of Russian colonisation, but in the whole region) by creating security and introducing modern means of communication. Central Asia was linked with the rest of Russia by two great railways the Andijan-Tashkend-Orenburg-Samara line leading to Moscow, and the Andijan-Samarkand-Bokhara-Merv-Askabad-Krasnovodsk (or&apos;&quot; Trans-Caspian &quot;) Rail-way, supplemented by a steamer service from Krasnovodsk to Baku, which connected it with the railways of Trans-Caucasia.The eastern terminus of both these railways was Ferghana, a small but densely-populated province, occupied by an industrious Moslem peasantry with few nomads or* The economic situation (especially the cotton question) will be dealt with in a separate memorandum. [367-23] B
Russian settlers. Ferghana grew cotton, and after the building of the railway the demands of Moscow manufacturers led to a rapid extension of the area under cotton cultivation at the expense of cereals, until the country came to depend largely for its food supply upon grain imported by rail from European Eussia in exchange for the cotton annually exported in the opposite direction.The economic relations with the rest of Eussia had thus become extremely close; but on the other hand the political jealousy and Protectionist policy of the Russian Government tended to isolate Central Asia from Persia, Afghanistan, India, and Sin-Kiang (the westernmost province of China, where the people, as in Eussian Central Asia, are mainly Turkish-speaking Moslems).Northwards, Central Asia was conterminous with the Eussian steppe provinces where the Eussian Government had been carrying: out an immense scheme of&quot;ill&apos;&apos; i&apos; ii .*/oagricultural colonisation during the last twenty years. This colonisation was at the expense of the Kirghiz nomads, and created dangerous friction with them. But as the country was colonised from north to south, a zone of Kirghiz remained between Turkestan and the colonised area (about 2,500,000 Kirghiz in the northern zone of Turkestan, and the same number in the southern zone of the steppes). Syemiryetch was the only province of Turkestan affected by the colonisation problem, but here the friction between settlers and natives was serious.Il-The Rebellion of 1916.Central Asia was not greatly affected by the outbreak of war, for both natives and Eussian settlers were exempted (from motives of fear and favour respectively) from compulsory military service. Even the intervention of Turkey seems to have produced no political reaction there (owing, no doubt, to the isolation of Central Asia from other Moslem countries); but the drain of rolling-stock to the European front early created difficulties in the food supply, and the refugees deposited without preparation in Tashkend and elsewhere spread disease. Yet on the whole Central Asia remained quiet till the Imperial Decree of the 25th June. 1916,* by which all populations of the Eussian Empire previously exempt from military service were suddenly called up for non-combatant service behind the front. &apos; &apos;In the area in process of colonisation this decree seems finally to have exasperated the Kirghiz to the point of rebellion, and led to a racial war between them and the local colonists and Cossacks, supported by Eussian regular troops. Huts were destroyed, cattle seized, and men, women, and children driven into the hills, where they died of hunger and exposure. In all about 500,000 Kirghiz are said to have perished, and 1,000,000 to have taken refuge across the Chinese frontier. The land thus vacated was at once occupied by the Eussians, and if the figures given are at all true, about a third of the Kirghiz nation was swept away.fThe decree also produced disturbances among the agricultural population of Turkestan, for when it was promulgated the cotton season was at its height, and mobilisation threatened the peasants with ruin. The d rafting of the men gave the Eussian officials occasion for bribe-taking and blackmail; and these various causes of discontent produced an outbreak at Jizak, on the railway north-east of Samarkand, which was punished by the massacre of the inhabitants and the burning of the town. There were also massacres at&apos;Andijan and Tashkend ; and though in the settled districts the disorder seems to have quieted down before the. revolution began, in the Kirghiz country, and especially in SyemiryeLchensk, the anarchy continued, and the refugees in China did not venture to return. $III. From the First Revolution (March 1917) to the&apos;Bolshevik Revolution atPetrograd (November 1917).In spite of the rebellions of 7 916, the revolution in Central Asia did not start as a Tacial conflict between natives, and Eussians. It was simply a response to the fait -accompli at Petrograd, and began by following the same course as there. But its setting was different in the different administrative areas.* Old style ?  Some accounts give the date as July 19.t &quot; Seuer i irient,&quot; II. 4 (p. 187), gives less sensational figures.I Article by M. Philips. Price, dated Orenburg, October 1, 1917, and published in the &quot;Manchester Guardian &quot;for November 28,1917; an anonymous article in the &quot; Manchester Guardian &quot; for December 11, 1917, based on speeches of MM. Kerensky and Jafavov in the secret session of the Duma on December 26,. 1916.  These speeches were published after the revolution in the journalKaspij&quot; of Baku.
(a.) In the Russian Provinces (except Syemiryetch).In Turkestan, as in European Russia, there was a dual development from the first, Soviets, representing the Russian urban proletariat and the military garrison, were formed both for the city of Tashkend and for the province of Syr-Darya.* And these took the initiative against the Governor-General Kuropatkin, who had been responsible for the savage treatment of the unrest during the past year. Kuropatkin and his staff were deposed (like the Grand-Duke Nicholas and his staff in the Caucasus); at the instance of the Moslems the Tashkend Soviet petitioned the Provisional Government at Petrograd to rescind the non-combatant service decree, and proposed that, when the next cotton season was over, military service on the normal basis should be introduced in Turkestan for Russians and Moslems alike. The Government responded by rescinding the decree, proclaiming an amnesty, and sending home the Turkestan Mosiems who had already been called upf.The administration of Turkestan, however, was committed by the Provisional Government, not to the Soviets, but to an Administrative Committee of Duma-members or ex-members. There was a Russian chairman and eight other members, four of whom were Moslems, namely : .Tynyshbayev, Bukeikhanov (Kirghiz), S. N. Maksudov, and Major-General Dawletjin (Tatar). The Moslems also began to form non-official party organisations.The appointment of a provisional administration was followed, as at Petrograd, by a steady encroachment on its powers from the side of the Soviets. At the time of the first reconstruction of the Government at Petrograd, the Tashkend and Syr-Darya Soviets are stated to have forced the Turkestan Administrative Committee to retire.$ But it seems to have survived in some form till Kornilov&apos;s abortive coup in September, when the Tashkend Soviet&apos; arrested the Administrative Committee of Turkestan and constituted itself a permanent committee of public safety.^The Soviets, representing as they did the soldiers and urban workers, were naturally composed entirely of Russians, and the Moslems countered their rise to power by strengthening their own organisations. In the municipal elections, which took place about August, they had a sweeping victory, capturing 77 out of 109 seats at Tashkend, 80 out of 102 at Kokand, and 7.7 out of 97 at Andijanl]. In August or September there was a congress of Moslem workers at Kokand, which declared for the transformation of Russia into a federal republic, in which Turkestan should enjov complete autonomy in the settlement of the land question.^ This congress was probably responsible for the deputation of Turkestan Moslems which shortly afterwards waited on Kerensky at Petrograd to complain of the application to Turkestan of the embargo on the conveyance of landed property a measure introduced all over Russia as a preliminary to the transfer of the land from private ownership to the State. Kerensky at once removed the embargo, and informed the deputation that the solution applied to the land question in European Russia would not be extended to their country.In September there was also an All-Turkestan Moslem Congress at Tashkend, which delegated executive powers to a Moslem Regional Council (already in existence). The latter held a joint sitting on the 26th September with the Turkestan (or possibly the Syr-Darya) Soviet which had -remained Menshevik, while the Tashkend Soviet had been captured by Bolshevik elements and the executive committees of the Councils of Peasants and Kirghiz. This convention passed a resolution denying the authority of any administration which had not received its sanction,!&quot;]&quot; and it was probably this that brought the outbreak of the Bolshevik Tashkend Soviet to a head.This first Bolshevik outbreak in Central Asia began with a mass-meeting at Tashkend, in which both the Administrative Committee of Duma members and the Menshevik Soviet of Turkestan were denounced. The Military Governor, whn appealed for Russian solidarity against the clanger of a Moslem rising, had to fly for his life. The Administrative Committee and the Turkestan Soviet were arrested by the Tashkend Soviet, which was supported by the two Russian regiments in garrison; while, on the other hand, the cadets of the military school arrested the revolutionary committee, seized the citadel, and were backed by a general emeute of the Moslem population. The Provisional Government at Petrograd, which was enjoying its brief respite between Kornilov&apos;s failure and Lenin&apos;s success, telegraphed an ultimatum to the Tashkend ;Soviet, and appointed the commander of the troops in the Kazan district to be* As well as local Soviets at Krasnovodsk.

Commissary-General of Turkestan, with - orders to suppress the outbreak by force.* At the same time, in order to make sure of the Moslems&apos; sympathy, a decree was promul--gated at Petrograd introducing the zemstvo system into the provinces of Trans-Caspia, Samarkand, Syr-Darya, and Ferghana a measure which would give the Moslems a share in local government, while Soviet-rule would mean the perpetuation of Russian racial ascendency behind a new facade, f This was about the beginning of October, and the Provisional Government at Petrograd appears to have fallen before the military intervention in Turkestan could he carried into effect. The Tashkend Soviet protested against the threatened &quot; punitive expedition &quot; by declaring a general strike.^ We have no details about the course of the local fighting which followed, but the results of it are dealt with below in section (iv).(b.) In Syemiryetch.The repeal of the Tsars decree of the 25 th June, 1916, and the amnesty to those who had resisted the application of it, which were among the earliest acts of the Provisional Government at Petrograd after the first revolution of March 1917, seem to have quieted the unrest in Turkestan as a whole, but not in the province of Syemiryetch. In Syemiryetch the grievance of compulsory service was reinforced by the much more serious grievance of the expropriation of the natives by Russian colonists, which had been in progress for about tMrenty years ; the resistance of the natives had precipitated a racial war; and after the massacre or expulsion of the greater part ot the Kirghiz population of the province, the Cossacks and Russian colonists had become de. facto possessors of their land.Early in the summer of 1917 the Taranchi^ and Dungansjl of Syemiryetch addressed a protest on zhe land question to the Executive Committee of the Ail-Russian Moslem Council at Petrograd (instituted at the Moscow Ail-Russian Moslem Congress in May 1917; and about the same time the Fetrograd Soviet issued a proclamation to the Kirghiz, condemning the colonisation policy of the Tsardom but urging them to wait for redress until the meeting of the Constituent Assembly.&quot; Meanwhile, the Provisional Government voted 11,000,000 roubles for relief, but on the 25th September, 1917, an appeal (apparently from Kirghiz sources) was published in the social revolu-tionary journal &quot; Dyelo Naroda,&quot;tt in which it was stated that no steps to alleviate the situation had yet been taken ; and this was confirmed by Mr. Philips Price in an article written at Orenburg on the 1st October, 1917.Jl Mr. Philips Price reported that the Kirghiz refugees in China had attempted to return, but that the colonists and Cossacks would not restore their land, and that the situation was beyond the Provisional Governments control. There is no evidence during the present year of any approach towards a settlement, though in February 1918 it was reported that two Russian delegates, appointed by the Petrograd Provisional Government before its fall, had arrived at Aksu (Sin-Kiang province, China) to treat with the Russian Kirghiz refugees there.(c.) In Khiva. -When the March revolution broke out at Petrograd the Khan of Khiva was taking a cure in the Crimea. He at once telegraphed expressions of loyalty to the Provisional Government, and returned to Khiva,^ where a popular movement quickly forced him to grant a constitution and to dismiss and punish his former Ministers. The new Khivan Mejlis (Parliament) asked the All-Russian Moslem, Council at Petrograd for advisers to assist in reconstruction, and two, namely, MM. A. Achmatovitch and Musa Bigeyev, were sent.\\\\The Khivan revolution was supported by the Yomud Turkmans, who had taken part in the rising of 1916, and had been chastised by a Russian punitive expedition. Their support took the form of plundering towns and destroying Russian property, and in August it was reported that the Russian authorities were taking military action against them.^[ This seems to have strengthened the anti-Russian as opposed to the revolutionary element in the Khivan movement.

was influencing the moslems in the russian provinces in the same direction; and it was reported irom another source that a khivap. subject named junaid khan, who had been a leader in the 1916 rising, was organising a movement for the complete independence of moslem central asia, seizing russian munitions, and establishing relations with the turkish propaganda. with this object he is said to have visited baku and tifiis at the beginning of october, when the fighting between the tashkend soviet and its moslem and bourgeois opponents was taking place. but nothing more has been heard of this individual, and on the whole khiva has played a very subor-dinate part in the course of the revolution, in central asia, owiug, no doubt, to its remoteness and its small population.(d.) In Bokhara.bokhara, on the other hand, with its fertile oases, comparatively large population,* and position athwart the railway between tashkend and trans-caspia, has been a focus of extremist and separatist tendencies.the khan of bokhara also protested his loyalty to russia after the revolution, and granted a constitution on the 20th april, 1917. but next day there was a counter-revolution led by the moslem clergy.and by reactionary officials and merchants, and a number of &quot;young bokharans&quot; were lynched by the mob. the counter-revolution seems to have been favoured tacitly by the khan, and openly by the russian resident M. miller, an official of the tsar&apos;s regime who had not yet been removed. the young bokharan executive committee thereupon appealed to the revolutionary committee at samarkand (in russian territory) ; russian troops entered bokhara and restored the constitution; miller and his assistant shulgin, and karnar (?)-ed-din, the s leader of the reactionary mullahs, were deported; the khan&apos;s prime minister was imprisoned and another appointed; and a new russian resident was sent out by the provisional government.this resident is reported from german sources to have adopted a policy of non-intervention in the internal affairs of bokhara, and to have declared that the khanate was &quot; a british as well as a russian sphere of influence &quot; a phrase of which german propaganda has made the most it can. thus the bokharan reactionaries were suppressed by force, but they are still the strongest party in the khanate; they have not forgotten samarkand and the other territories which bokhara had to cede to russia in 1864; and if the movement for a reactionary, fanatical, independent, and united moslem central asia prevails, it may be prophesied that bokhara will be the centre of it.tIV. From the Bolshevik Revolution at Petrograd (November 1917) to the Bolshevikcoup d&apos;etat at&apos;Kokand (February 1918).As has been stated above (iii, a), there is no information with regard to the fighting thai, began towards the end of september 1917 between the tashkend soviet on the one hand and the moslems and moderate russian elements on the other, except for the report that the tashkeud soviet was assisted by german prisoners of war.the soviet, with the support of the rank and file of the llussian garrison, seems quickly to have gained military control of the city of tashkend itself, $ where it dissolved the existing workmen and soldiers&apos; organisations and formed a new body of purely bolshevik elements. but its power did not extend further. the orenburg cossacks cut the tashkend-moscowr railway in order to isolate tashkend from european russia (where lenin was by this time in power) and to deprive it of food supplies -a measure which incidentally threatened to starve the whole of central asia.l the syemiryetch province refused to recognise the tashkend soviets authority; the professional unions of samarkand, at a joint sitting held on the 14th december, decided not to send delegates to tashkend,H and on the 9th^[ or 11th the turkestan moslem congress assembled at kokand, in ferghana, and decided to proclaim the autonomy of turkestan as part of a russian federation, subject to confirmation by an all-russian constituent assembly ; to appoint a provisional government and a representative council to carry on the local administration until the constituent assembly should meet; and to enter into relations with trans-caucasia and the cossacks.the moslem congress which took this step was a coalition between the moslem regional council (a body of &quot;cadet&quot; tendencies organised by the more educated and* Certainly over a million. f &quot; Neuer Orieut,&quot; 1, 2, 4/5, 10; II, 4.J &quot; Neuer Orient,&quot; &quot;ll, 9. s &quot; Neuer Orieut,&quot; II, 10.

gwell-to-do Turkestan Moslems at the beginning of the revolution) and the Moslem Federalists, a smaller party which had been in favour of autonomy all along. The Moslems thus presented a comparatively united front, and they had the support of the bourgeois and Menshevik Russians. The new Provisional Government was composed of six Moslems and a Jewish Minister of Finance,^ but in the new representative council the Moslems only reserved 36 out of 54 seats for themselves, leaving the other third to the Russians. In fact, &quot;the Provisional Government at Kokand repre-sented the same combination of moderate elements as the old Administrative Committee of Duma members at Tashkend, with the significant change that the preponderance had now passed from the Russians to the Moslems&apos;, and that the policy had been definitely decided in favour of decentralisation.The Government of seven and Council of fifty-six took office at Kokand on the 23rd December, and the autonomy of Turkestan seems to have been proclaimed formally on this date. Syemiryetch, Trans-Caspia, and the two khanates were not included in the proclamation,! and it has been ascertained from another source that (as might have, been expected) there were no Bokharan or Afghan participants in these proceedings.The Tashkend Soviet retorted on the 26th December by declaring a state of siege..&quot;!; For a moment they had the prospect of support from the small Moslem &quot; Ulema&quot; party, an element in the Russian provinces corresponding to the reactionaries at Bokhara. The &quot; Ulema&quot; may have been influenced by the extraordinary wireless appeal to Moslem fanaticism launched by Lenin from Petrograd on the 6th December. At any rate, they held a congress at Tashkend in the middle of December, under the wing of the Soviet. *. But (unless our accounts of the whole episode are confused) they quickly fell out with one another, for we hear of fighting; at Tashkend during the same month between the Soviet and its Moslem supporters, on the one side, and the &quot;Ulema&quot; party on the other; and in January 1918 the Moslem clergy of Ferghana are said to have published (in a vernacular paper, the &quot; Ulugh Turkestan &quot;) a manifesto denouncing all Russians as infidels and tyrants, and calling on all Moslems to establish an independent federation, &quot; with a national anthem of their own.&quot;This points to a reconciliation between the Moslem Liberals and reactionaries in opposition to the Russian Bolshevik Soviet at Tashkend, leading to a more uncom-promising policy on the part of the Moslem bloc as a whole. It was reported in January that the general impression among the Ferghana Moslems was that the federation would be with Turkey rather, than with Russia, and that four Turkish propagandists had appeared at Kokand and been well received. On the other hand, it was reported from the same source In February that there were no signs of pan-Turaniauism in Ferghana, that order was fairly well maintained, and that the food supply was improving. The administration was being carried on quietly, under the authority of the Provisional Government, by the old Russian officials. Prisoners of war (mostly Austrians) were allowed personal liberty, but had to answer roll-calls, and were under control. There were still a moderate number of Russian troops in the province, who were also under control, and were in fact involuntary prisoners, but were free to take service with the Kokand Government.   There was as yet no Moslem army.Thus from December to February Ferghana (which owing to its cotton crop is the most important province of Russian Central Asia) was actually governed by a representative and fairly moderate Moslem organisation in harmony with the Russian Moderates. But the continuance of this regime depended on whether the local Russian soldiery would support it or would follow the example of their comrades at Tashkend.y.--The Bolshevik Coup d&apos;Etat of February 1918 at Kokand.The Provisional Government at Kokand failed to prevent Bolshevik propaganda, and on the night of the llth-12th February a Bolshevik coup-d&apos;Etat (evidently carefully prepared beforehand) was carried out. Bands of desperadoes (thought to have been Daghestanis) cut the lelephone and telegraph wires and damaged the railway, thus isolating Kokand from the rest of the province. They also attacked-though unsuccessfully the citadel and the house of the president of the local (presumably Menshevik) Soviet. Next morning a force of Red Guards appeared (it is not clear whether they were disaffected troops of the local Russian garrison or -whether they had been conveyed secretly from Tashkend). They were joined by the Kokand Armenians and Russian reservists ; the President of the Provisional Government^ was arrested;* &quot;Neuer Orieut,&quot; II, 8, 9. t &quot; Neuer Orient,&quot; II, 8.\ &quot; Neuer Orient,&quot; II, 9. S Shahiakhnietov (the original President in December was Tynyshbayev).
and a Military Revolutionary Committee was set up, On the 18th and 14th February there was street fighting between the Red Guards and the Provisional Governments supporters. The fighting was indecisive, and an armistice followed. But on the 18th February Bolshevik reinforcements arrived under the command of the military commissary of the Tashkend Soviet. There were two more days of desperate fighting, during which the town was completely sacked and largely burnt down, but by the 20th February the Red Guards were masters of Kokand. The supporters of the Provisional Government were executed or deporied in large numbers. The &quot; rebellion&quot; of the Provisional Government was declared at an end, and an amnesty offered On condition of complete submission, surrender of leaders, and delivery of arms. The deaths at Kokand during this struggle are estimated at from 3,000 to 5,000, and the material damage at 300,000,000 roubles. Thousands of people were made homeless, and great stores of cotton were burnt. *Syr-Darya, Ferghana, and Samarkand provinces were now reunited in the Tashkend Soviefs hands. But the overthrow of the Moslem Government in Ferghana seems to have infuriated the reactionaries in Bokhara, and at the beginning of March a struggle broke out between them and the Young Bokharans, who may be presumed (though there is no information on the point) to have remained precariously in power since their restoration by Russian troops in April 1917. As on the former occasion, the Young Bokharans appealed to the revolutionary, element in the Russian provinces, now represented by the Bolsheviks, while the Old Bokharans also had Russian support in the shape of ex-officers of the Russian garrisons in Central Asia. The Tashkend Soviet was thus concerned in the Bokharan civil war, the more so as it was interrupting traffic along the Trans-Caspian Railway, on which (and the water-route by the Caspian and the Volga) the Central Asiatic Bolsheviks were entirely dependent for communication with the Bolshevik Government in Europe.t Accordingly a well-equipped Bolshevik expeditionary force (infantry, cavalry, artillery, railway battalion) was sent to help the Young Bokharans and to clear the line, and the Old Bokharans were defeated in two bloody battles.^ The second of these seems to have been fought on the 17th March, and by the 31st March the Tashkend army was across the Caspian and fighting in Baku.Baku was at this time in the bands of the Trans-Caucasian Tatars, who had formed a National Council after the Bolshevik revolution at Petrograd in November, and were co-operating, in the Trans-Caucasian Commissariat and Diet, with the Georgians and Armenians. But the Tatars, though a majority in the surrounding country, were only one element among many in Baku itself, with its great industrial population-Russian, Armenian, and cosmopolitan. Tbe Armenians were at odds with the Tatars, and all the non-Tatar elements were open to Bolshevik ideas. Accordingly the arrival of small Bolshevik forces in gun-boats from Central Asia (with a contingent, apparently, from Astrakhan) was enough to cause an outbreak in the city, and after more than a week of fighting, as bloody as that at Kokand, the Tatars were beaten and Baku remained in Bolshevik hands-!Thus by the middle of April the Tashkend Soviet had beaten down all resistance in the vast region depending on the Trans-Caspian Railway, from Ferghana to Baku. And in May a Soviet Congress at Tashkend declared Russian Turkestan a Soviet republic, delegated the government to a Council of Peoples Commissaries, and sent a mission to Moscow to delimit frontiers with the People&apos;s Commissariat there.VI.-The Present Outlook.The violent substitution of a Bolshevik regime in Central Asia for the Provisional Government at Kokand affects-the situation very adversely from the British point of view. A moderate Moslem administration, on good terms with the moderate element in the local Russian population, and aiming at making Turkestan an autonomous State in a democratic Russian federation, was a better neighbour for India than the Tsardom had ever been. But the sack of Kokand has thrust the moderates into the background, and the alternatives are now either a continuance of the present tyranny of the ex-Russian garrison and the proletariat of Tashkend (which means simply Russian racial domination in a new form) or a fanatical Moslem reaction, led by the Ulema of* &quot;Novaya Zhisn,&quot; March 27, 1918.f The Tashkend-Moscow line does not seem to have been reopened since it was cut in the autumn of 1917, and the successive Trans-Caucasian Governments ^both federal and national) have never entered into relations with the Bolsheviks.$ i: Watergate House&quot;: Review of the Neutral Press, June 14, 1918.S &quot; La Voix de 1&apos;Armenie,&quot; No. 11.
Bokhara, directed against all European influence in Central Asia, and aiming at including the whole of Turkestan in an independent Moslem khanate in alliance with other Moslem Powers,As might be expected Moslem feeling in Bokhara and the Eussian provinces is reported to be extremely bitter, and a very authoritative informant a, citizen of an allied country,who was in Central Asia from the middle of February to the middle of April, and therefore saw the Bolshevik conquest at first hand-states that German propaganda is active among them, preaching the oppressiveness of British rule in India, and the desirability of an entente between Bokhara and Turkey. The same informant also states that the German and Austrian prisoners of war again fought on the $olshevik side, especially in the Bokhara campaign. He estimates them at 8,000 Germans and 30,000 Austrians, and regards them, thoiuxb this seems an exasperation, as a menace to India.The chief menace in the situation is the orientation of the Central Asian Moslems towards Turkey and Germany, which the events of the last few months have undoubtedly encouraged. The Tashkend Commissariat maintains its authority by force, but the country as a whole is in anarchy, and many of its Moslem inhabitants are slaughtered, starving, homeless, or beggared. There is no prospect of a just and effective Government in Eussia. England is far away, and the enemy version of our policy in India and Persia has given us an evil name. It is inevitable that the Central Asians should turn to Turkey aud Afghanistan.A recent telegram from India reports that an envoy from the Khan of Bokhara has been sympathetically received by the Amir of Afghanistan, and there was a rumour early in May that the Khans of Khiva and Bokhara had accepted a proposal from Turkey that they should join a Pan-Turanian federation. This, if it is true, shows a significant change from the situation a year earlier, when the Parliament (not the Khan) of Khiva appealed for assistance to the All-Eussiau Moslem Council at Petrograd. But on the 17th May the dissolution of the All-Bussian Council byLenin&apos;8 Government was announced at Moscow,* and there is now an open breach in European as in Asiatic Eussia between the Moslems and the Bolshevik regime.At the end of February 1918 Sadri Maksudov, the President of the representative council in Ferghana, arrived in Constantinople. He must have started before the Bolshevik coup of the 11th February, and his mission was to thank Turkey for the foundation of five medresseS in Turkestan, for which the Ottoman Parliament had voted funds. But Maksudov took occasion to make a speech attacking the Eussians, and prophesying a glorious future for Turkestan, &quot;with the help of our brothers in Constantinople.&quot; It is said that this speech was placarded in Turkey, and that Maksudov and the Sheikh-ul-Islam at Constantinople sent joint greetings to the Moslems of the Crimea, the Caucasus, Khiva, Bokhara, Persia, India, and China.In Central Asia, then, the Pan-Turanian or Pan-Islamic movement, is in the ascendant, and a fresh trial of strength between Moslems and Bolsheviks cannot long be delayed. It is almost inconceivable that the Bolshevik regime the tyranny of a tiny minority, without supplies, and hardly in touch with their partisans in Eussia  should have any permanence, and, if it falls, it is likely to be succeeded by actively anti-British forces.The least disadvantageous course from the British point of view seems to be to avoid intervention in Central Asian affairs. But that may be difficult, for as soon as , the Turkish troops approach Baku the Armenians and Tashkend Bolsheviks, who. jointly hold the city, are more than likely to offer it to us. The possibility of keeping the enemy out of Baku is obviously a consideration of the highest importance, since the oil wells are reported to be still undamaged, and also because Baku is the bridgehead of the Trans-Caspian Bailway. On the other hand, co-operation on our part with the present holders of Baku would undoubtedly strengthen the anti-British feeling among Moslems in the Middle East.June 25, 1918.o&apos; Watergate House Daily Review,&quot; May 25, 1918.
