Colonel I. Dam 101*200This Document is the property of His Britannic Majesty s Government. SECRET.,. .   . E.O. 718.7^ WAR CABINET.x$OS/f.    ) EASTERN COMMITTEE./all ut-..^* The War in the East.i write.the following at the request of the meeting which I was invited to attend on the 17th June, and i write it on one hypothesis which governs all I write. If this Hypothesis is dismissed as improbable, the matter is not worth consideration. Events iri the West do not look as if the Germans will be deprived of all initiative as the result of this summer&apos;s campaign. It would appear to me that the most our military advisers are hopeful of obtaining is such a result in the West as would probably relieve our anxiety in the West for the rest of the war. If that be so, is it not absolutely certain that the most likely theatre in which the Germans can obtain military success is the East, and is it not humanly probable that they will naturally seek to approach peace discussions after the obliteration of our gains of enemy territory in Mesopotamia and Palestine, and if possible after some threat to our territories in the East which might produce results comparable, if not equal, to the position which they have now established in the West? Do not recent developments in the East, the appearance of the two German Divisions at Batonm and Poti, and the accounts we receive of their activities, point to a probability of this kind? Is it not possible that considerable results might be looked for by organisation and by money without necessarily involving, much expenditure of personnel ?I have before me as 1 write a Foreign Office Memorandum, dated 8th May, recording conferences between leading German and Turkish politicians, from which. I quote the following sentences : &quot; The general plan evidently is to prepare the ground by propaganda and to follow this up with military operations when and where local co-operation can be counted upon. There is no evidence that the despatch of large forces is contemplated. The idea rather seems to be to send the minimum forces that will set local, movements in motion - and to leave these movements to do the rest. Stress is laid on securing the command of the Black Sea- and Trans-Caucasia: Northern Persia, Russian Central Asia, and Afghanistan are the objectives, and it is hoped that effects will be produced in China and India.&quot;I assert, therefore, that there is room for believing that there is a serious menace, which will take some months to mature, in the East. These conferences were held, in the winter of last year and the spring of this, and subsequent events point to an active pursuit of the policy decided upon therein. It would seem to me to be indicative that in all probability their present efforts are directed towards Trans-Caspia and Turkestan, that they are, as it. were, proceeding northwards of General MarshalPs activities with a view to disturbing Afghanistan and threatening India.I have nothing to add to the comments that I have already made on the attitude of Afghanistan.The question to which I would ask the Cabinet to turn their attention is shortly this. Have we not on the whole neglected the East ? Are we now&apos;organised to meet the threat in the East? Ought we not to prepare far more thoroughly to meet that threat? I propose to confine myself to the present and the future and to content myself with merely asking the question about the past.The conduct of affairs in the Middle East is now vested in a Committee, of which I have the honour to be a member, under the Presidency of Lord Curzon, dealing with Middle East affairs which are entrusted under the supervision of the Committee &quot;&quot;in their respective spheres to the Eoreign Office, the War Office, and the India oil^e. I do not think that this is a satisfactory plan. I say nothing about the India Office, for it is impossible for me to express an unprejudiced opinion about my own Office. But it is differentiated from the others&quot;in that its whole activities.are concerned with the East, with India and its defences,-with India and the countries which border it, whereas the Foreign Office and the War Office have immeasurable and overwhelm in g responsibilities in other directions.   I can also speak with certainty -when I say thatSS 630; GO 7/18 -........................-----........----.........-
action has been delayed by the necessity for awaiting decisions of tho Eastern Committee. It is no fault of the Committee, which is composed of men of such pre-occupations as those which beset my colleagues, that they cannot meet often, that they cannot meet in practice at a moments notice, and that when they meet it must take some time to master a situation embodied in sheafs of telegrams from various sources, which have to be collated and digested. Were it not for the inexhaustible capacity for work and indefatigable industry of our Chairman, I do not see how tho Committee could discharge its functions at all.In the Paper which I addressed to the War Cabinet on the 4th November last year from Egypt, I ventured to suggest that the proper method of handling the affairs of Egypt, Arabia, Mesopotamia, Persia, &amp;c., was by a new department roughly analogous to the new Overseas Trade Department,&apos; a condominium of the Foreign Office and the India Office, and an Under Secretary representing the new Department in Parliament. Our relations to these countries, which might range from actual possession through protectorate, but never to complete sovereignty, differentiated them in my opinion from the ordinary activities of the Foreign Office and ought to be separated from them. They were so largely administrative and so little technically diplomatic that they seemed to me to want special -recruitment and a separate cadre. This, however, was not intended as an immediate war measure. It might bo preferable to have a (Secretary of State for the Middle East, a remedy which I have reason to believe Lord Curzon, with the great authority of his experience, would not disfavour. This modification of my proposal would have my cordial support, for of course the now Secretary of State would act in co-operation with the other two Offices primarily concerned.But this remedy would seem to me to be difficult, if not impossible, during war time, The difficulty of finding the personnel for a new office is very real, and during war time at any rate the War Office must of course.be taken into account in what, as I have stated in my premises, seems to me to be developing into an important war area.I therefore would suggest that the Eastern Committee should continue to exist. There would be advantages in making it a Committee of Ministers only, with, of course, expert advice and assistance available in the room at the time of its meetings. I would also suggest that it should not attempt actual executive action, but that it should be a Cabinet Committee, discussing, on behalf of the Cabinet, Cabinet matters, questions of policy, leaving details of the conduct of the policy to the Departments concerned.It might be desirable to have a sub-committee of the Eastern Committee, consisting of an Under Secretary of State or an Assistant Under Secretary of State from the Foreign Office and from the India Office, with the Director of Military Intelligence from the War Office ; the duties of the Sub-Committee being to thresh out everything, and to give decisions except upon matters of high policy or of such great importance as should go before the Ministers of the Committee for decision.These are, however, merely modifications of existing procedure and composition, on which the Cabinet and the Chairman of the Committee can offer better opinion than I can attempt to do.Turning now to the executive problem, I would discuss it first from the political standpoint and only secondly from the military standpoint.I would suggest as.regards political affairs that the present system of obtaining political information is very unsatisfactory.1. The system of: &quot;dual control,&quot; by which certain British Consulates in Persia are staffed by officers of the Levant Consular Service in direct subordination to the Minister at Tehran, and others by officers of the Indian Political Department, primarily responsible to the Government of India, prevailed for many years before-the war. It entailed certain inconveniences and at times gave rise to friction ; but on the whole it Avorked reasonably well as a peace-time arrangement. Piis Majesty&apos;s Government received recommendations, &amp;c, independently from the Minister and from the Government of India, and in the event of a conflict of opinion, as would sometimes happen, the question was threshed out between the Foreign Office and India Office and a decision reached after due consideration.2. The conditions created by the Avar, or at any rate its recent developments in the East, have profoundly modified the situation. Persia has virtually become a theatre of hostilities. Columns of British troops are operating on the East frontier, in the North-West, and in the Fars Province in the South ; while a strong local force (the South Persia Rifles) has been raised in the last-named region, nominally in the service of the Persian Government, but actually controlled and directed by ourselves.
3. Under the stress of these complications, it is not too much to say that the old system of political control, lias broken down. A dispute is raging at the moment between the Consul, at Sliiraz and the officer in command of the South Persia Rifles (Sir P. Sykes) over the latter&apos;s claims to be consulted in political matters. The Minister at Tehran is strongly opposed to these claims (there has been friction between him and Sir P. Sykes for some little time past) and takes exception to the instructions Avhich the Government of India have sent to the Consul (their own officer) on the subject. On general questions of Persian policy, the divergence of opinion between the Government of India and the Minister has for months past been so wide that it was thought necessary at one stage to request the Viceroy to discon-tinue the practice of repeating his telegrams to Tehran, so that the Minister might not be embarrassed by diversity of: counsel. The role of the Government of India in Persian,matters is merely an advisory one, and the non-acceptance of their views does no&apos;t, in itself, give them any legitimate cause of complaint ; but as they have been charged with the task of maintaining tho &quot;cordon&quot; in East Persia, as well as of supplying and reinforcing (though not controlling the operations of) the South Persia Rifles, they have acquired a direct material interest in political developments with which their influence upon policy can scarcely be-regarded as commensurate.4. Mesopotamia introduces another element of uncertainty. The supreme authority in the occupied territory is necessarily the General Officer Commanding, acting under the orders of the War Office. But the civil side of the temporary administration, which has acquired, a position approaching that of semi-independence, is in subordination somewhat ill-defined, it is true to the Government of India.. Recently the army in Mesopotamia -has extended its right flank into Persian territory, with the result, that a part of the political activities of the force have been brought within the sphere of control of the Minister at Tehran. A political officer attached to General Dunsterville&apos;s column on the Kermanshah-Hamadan road is, in fact, under three masters. Pie is, of course, subordinate to the local high command ; as a member of the Mesopotamian political service he remains under the Civil. Commissioner at Baghdad, who is subordinate to the Government of India ; while as a political officer in Persia he has to conform to the instructions of the Minister, who has a general responsibility for all political activities in Persian territory. Mr. Churchill, late Oriental Secretary to the Tehran Legation, is a case in point. The Foreign Office, whose servant he is, decided to attach him as a political officer to General Dunster-ville&apos;s force. They acted without formal consultation either with the War Office or the India Office, and the result was that, when Mr. Churchill arrived at Baghdad, neither the General Officer Commanding nor the Civil Commissioner knew anything -about his appointment, and had to telegraph home for instructions as to his disposal.5. Some clearer definition may also be required of the status of the two Missions recently sent from India to Meshed and Kashgar respectively, with a view to ultimate penetration, into Russian Turkestan. The Meshed party has been declared to be a-&quot; military &quot; mission, and will presumably receive its instructions, through the Military Attache at Meshed, from the Indian military authorities. But so long as it remains in Persia it must regulate its political conduct by the advice or instructions of the Minister, and there is at least the risk that the same kind of uncertainties and disagreements may arise, on a smaller scale, as have been experienced in connection with Sir P. Sykes1 Mission in South. Persia.It seems to me to be essential that all the officers giving us political information in the new war area should be unified. Either they should all be Foreign Office officials, or they should all be India Office officials. They should be organised under responsible authorities in order to reduce the conflict of evidence and to prevent the telegrams and answers to telegrams which evidence their differences of opinion. As. an area develops into a war area it seems to me to be more and more important that the political officers should be subordinated to that authority which is controlling the military operations.As regards the military operations, I cannot help thinking that decentralisation ought to be the main consideration, and that the Director of Military Intelligence at the War Office ought not to be burdened with all the rapidly increasing detail of work connected with war in the East, which must make such increasing demands upon him as the war spreads eastwards. 1. am inclined to consider whether the whole Avar area from Palestine eastward managed from India by the Indian Government both militarily and politically AA^ould not be possible, even if this involved some new Avar organisation in India, and it seems to me that this need not be inconsistent with the o-eneral control by the War Office of all military operations. It is for the War Office ,to consider Avhether their organisation needs strengthening for the purpose, or
separating, and if so to what degree, from tho organisation which deals with otljer theatres. This would relieve the homo authorities, military and political/-enormously, and having regard to the fact that the men to be used in the whole of this area come from India, the advantage to be &apos;gained by this arrangement would be that the conflicting demands on the common reservoir of the different areas would be adjudged by those who had knowledge of the whole oil them. Failing this, it would seem to me to be best that some portion of tins area should be given, politically and militarily to the Government of India, strengthened and modified, if need be, for the purpose by the despatch of officers from home, and that, subject to the control of policy by the \Var Cabinet or the Eastern Committee on its behalf, the Government of: India should be given the freest possible hand in the raising and training of adequate troops to vanquish our enemies in the areas which &quot;may from time to time be threatened. The line should, it appears to me, probably be drawn somewhere between this which has been acknowledged as including the smallest area and the very wide suggestion I have made above. I must leave this to the judgment oE the War Office. I recognise the great difficulty of defining the actual area. Palestine is so linked with Egypt as possibly to make it unwise to include it in the Eastern area. South Eastern Persia has already been transferred, but the line thus drawn makes unity of political and military control difficult.Although I have pointed out the difficulties of the existing system with all deference and respect, I put forward these rough suggestions for decentralisation with even greater trepidation and hesitation. J am more inclined to ask the two Departments concerned, the Foreign Office and the War Office, whether they are satisfied with the present state of affairs, and -whether they cannot suggest a remedy. Is there not room for a Middle East War Department, a sub-department of the War Office, to conduct the war in the East ? Should this sit in England or should it sit in India or somewhere else in the East ? What should be the extent of its territories ? Should a sort ol; War Department be erected in Egypt or in Baghdad, or would the fact that the trend of war is more to the north-east than either ol these areas mate it desirable that it should be further East still ? Is there any other suggestion which would tend to decentralisation ? The same questions that I would ask of the War Office I would also ask of the Foreign Office, substituting political for military-considerations and drawing their attention to the necessity of combining these two-aspects of the problem.E. S. M.5th July 1918.P.S. I append a telegram from the Viceroy, dated the 9th July, relevant to the question discussed in this note.Telegram from Viceroy, dated 9/7t July 1918.Secret. Spheres of control. Your telegram of 4th instant. With every desire-to avoid controversy, we feel it our duty to state plainly our difficulties in regard to Persia. We have throughout had before us the principle that policy must be dictated by military force available to support it. This principle we feel has not been sufficiently borne in mind in the adoption of the policy of force recommended by Minister at Tehran, who appears &quot;neither to have appreciated the force available nor understood the necessary limitations, namely, supply, transport, &amp;c, to its application. The result has been failure at Tehran, combined with serious and indefinite military commitments elsewhere, which are calculated to react unfavourably throughout the Middle East, especially on Afghanistan, which is the pivot of the problem. This policy we have persistently, perhaps importunately, opposed, but to no purpose. Indeed, by your instructions we have, since the middle of March, been debarred even from repeating our views to the Minister.With the Turco-German menace before us, we considered our policy should, be to secure the friendship as far as possible of the countries that form the glacis of India. To this end we recommended a policy of national conciliation in Persia,, coupled with removal of the main causes of irritation, and this would, we believe, have secured a:genuinely friendly Persian Government and people, and obviated the present embarrassments. As, it is, we are .confronted with trouble from the Gulf to the Caspian, with further trouble threatening. The divorce between political and military, control is mainly responsible tor these conditions, and it was danger involved in continuing in this system with military operations actually in progress that &quot;prompted pur telegram of 1st July.
