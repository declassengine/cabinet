Colonel f. Dallj Jones,HIS DOCOHEMT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANHIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMEBT) r190war cabinet.BORET. i -----.t.5078.fair wages clause and GOVligP]^ Wf^ka^ts;Memorandum by the Postmaster-General (Previous papers g;t74805, G,t/499s, g.t.5023 and G.t.5077).I have considered the memorandum of Mr. Roberts^ and Dr. Addisonxon the proposed Amendment of the Fair Wages Resolution of the House of Commons passed March 101*4909.If this Amendment is adopted I am sure it will have very disastrous results for the Government and the taxpayer in the price paid for goods or services supplied.The result of the Fair Wages Resolution is that the contractor, as a rule, pays more than the market price for labour..   If - when the economic world becomes normal some years after the war - a firm becomes a Government contract-or, he will either be shut out from other markets on account of his high cost of production as compared with his compet-itor, who does no Government work and only pays the market price for labour, or be forced not to undertake any Govern-ment work.The result would be that only a few firms would tender for Goverment   contracts on condition that the whole of their production would be taken by the Government.This would result in a very restricted market for the Government to buy in, the small number of firms who would tender would make a ring and get an unduly high price.For these reasons % hope that the War Cabinet will reject the Amendment.(Sd), ALBERT H, ILLINGWORTH.reneral Post Office, London. July 9th, 1918..4805 ,5023
