this Document is the property of /ft 4 5Hte ..&apos; oovewnt.i submit to the war cabinet considerations .011 the report from the trade relations committee new -before them relating to preference on existing dutiable articles and suggest tlia-t it is desirable that it should be adopted with the least possible delay and referred to the imperial war conferencecthe subject with which the report deals has already arisen in the discussion of the imperial war conference on raw materials.    i have pointed out that the policy involved in those resolutions has reference only to the transitional period following the war and is in no way an alternative-to the policy of preference which was adopted by the war cabinet and expressed in resolution 21 of the imperial far conference last year.the interest of the imperial war conference in the measures for carrying out this preference resolution has manifested itself in other ways also, such as enquiries into the policy which may be adopted with regard to the destination of manufactures produced from empire raw materials and whether there is to be any restriction or discrimina-tion in respect of such destination;   in regard to shipping preferences^ the policy to be adopted with regard to the meat supplies of the empire.i think that in regard to several of the resolutions which the imperial conference has still to discuss it is impossible to avoid raising this subject because the policy of the preference resolution of last year is the necessary complement to other measures&apos;which are being recommended for making the empire as far as possible independent of foreign supplies.Iru
In these circumstances, and seeing that tho Conference is fully representative of all parts of the Empire, there would be, I feel sure a strong feeling of disappointment and annoyamce in the country and in Parliament if the Conference separated without an exchange of views on the issues involved in the Resolutions submitted this year and the steps taken or to be taken to carry out those of last yoar!o Conference.The Report now before the War CaMnet is one of a series of reports on trade policy drawn up by the Trade Relations Committee whioh, this one alone ex-ceptedvhave been approved *In drawing up the Report all the articles now in the dutiable list were separately examined and each one was considerid on its merits *  These separatereports were the basis of the general report now bo-fore the War Cabinet,    The general principle applied is that which has been approved at successive Imperial Conferences by all the Dominions represented and last year by His Majesty&apos;s Government as well. &quot;Where duties are in operation preference should be established in respect of such duties; but it is not recommended that duties should be imposed in the United Kingdom solely for the purpose of giving preference to the Dominions and Colonies.  That course has never been asked for or recommended by the Dominions and it obviously depends upon conditions which have to be considered in relation to the general economic policy of the United Kingdom.    The Report, however, recommends that if new import duties are imposed in the United Kingdom preference should be given in respect of those duties to the productions
of the Dominions and. Colonies.    It is also recom-mentied that to aid our Allies in repairing the devastation of the War, temporary preference on certain articles might be extended to them&apos;.The general,method recommended for the Preferences to the Dominions is a rebate; of 33^70. The feeling in the Committee was against the prin-ciple of giving a Preference by increasing the existing duties in respect of productions from foreign countries, but it was not thought desirable to tie our hands absolutely by a formal adoption of this principle because it was felt that cases might arise in which, for financial, reasons, the object to be secured might be best attained by increasing the duties against foreign countries rather than by a grant of a rebate to Empire productions.The Committee feel that this Report carries the question of tariff Preferencesas far as it can be carried before that complete overhauling of the fiscal system of the United.Kingdom which will take place after the restoration of Peace;   and I feel sure that if the far Cabinet will adopt these recommendations they would go far to satisfy the Empire that the United Kingdom will take the earliest possible steps to give practical effect to the Preference Resolution adopted at the Conference in 1917*W.H.L.-    -bLONIAL OFFICE,8th July, 1918. \ .
