(Extract from the "Times", 9th July, 1918.)

STRONG INTERNMENT POLICY.

WINDING-UP THE BANKS.

The report and recommendations of the members of the House of Commons appointed to investigate the enemy alien question were presented to the Prime Minister yesterday. The text is given below.

The feeling in the country found expression yesterday in strong speeches in the House of Lords. A clear policy was demanded from the Government.

TEXT OF THE REPORT.

Dear Prime Minister, - In accordance with your desire conveyed to us on Monday evening last we beg to submit, in a series of recommendations, our considered views on the position of aliens in this country and on the scope and character of the action which should be taken by his Majesty&apos;s Government in dealing with the problem.

Though much justifiable public anxiety exists concerning the freedom still permitted in this country to persons of enemy origin, we desire to record our belief that any wholesale charge of treason against such persons is unwarranted, and to state that in arriving at the recommendations set forth we have been guided solely by the predominant consideration of the safety of the realm in a time of war.

We would venture to express the opinion that one of the causes contributing to the present alien situation is the lack of co-ordination between the departments, eight in number, which, in varying degree, share in the enforcement of the law. It is only fair to add that the departments concerned have been handicapped in their administration by the absence of a clearly defined policy on the part of his Majesty&apos;s Government on many phases of this delicate and complex problem.

It is therefore worthy of consideration whether the responsibility for the control of aliens during the war should not be placed in charge of one individual (conceivably the Parliamentary Secretary to the Home Office) who should be chairman of an inter-departmental, committee co-ordinating the activities of the various departments concerned, and at the same time be directly responsible to the Home Secretary and to the House of  Commons for the administration of a uniform and clearly defined Government policy.
We also deem it our duty to suggest that in arriving at decisions concerning naturalized enemy aliens his Majesty1a Government should not ignore the provisions of the German.Imperial, and State Nationality Law of July 22, 1913 (Parliamentary Paper Cd. 7277), whioh enaots as follows :- (Section 2[?) &quot; A person does not lose his nationality if, before acquiring aiforeign nationality,&apos;he has applied for, and&quot;received,&apos; the written permission of tho competent authorities of his home State1to retain his nationality;&quot;We have not&quot;thought it desirable in this, communication to deal with the question of espionage, notwithstanding&apos;that:in the course-of our investigations certain facts have::been&apos; placed before :us upon which we propose to prepare for you a separate and secret37 G JDO !K*,&quot;fc *RE COMENDAT IONS i ADULT MALE ENEMY. AUKgQ.1.     We recommend that every male enemy alien-over 18 years of age be interned forthwith, unless there.,is definite national or medical reason for exemption.     The definite national reason for exemption should in each case be clearly stated by a central controlling authority and be made available for public information. Male enemy aliens exempted from internment by reason of ill-health should be medically certified by three doctors nominated by a central controlling authority.&quot; ADULT ITEHALE .&amp;NMY- ATHENS. -2.    We recommend that-a2ien women of enemy origin, except those whose husbands have .been -granted.exemption from,internment, shall, as far as is practicable, be:repatriated.    -In certain&apos;tases it nay be necessary to consider the alternative of - internment-, while in other .cases justice and humanity may dictate exemption from both these courses.  .RECENT ENEKY. NATURALIZATIONS *3.     We recommend that all certificates of naturalization grant--ed-to enemy aliens since January 1, 1914&apos; (the date of the coming into force of the German Imperial and State Nationality -Law) shall be referred for review to the Advisory &quot;Committee prosidod&apos;over by ;Mr. Justice Sankey and Mr. Justice Younger, and cancelled, unless in the v,^pinion&apos;Of such Committee there are national-reasons to the contrary.ENEMY NATURALIZATIONS BEFORE 1914,4.    We-recommend that in all cases of existing certificates of naturalization granted to enemy aliens prior to-January 1,1914, where prima facie evidence is forthcoming -from/any responsible &apos; person or persons questioning&apos;the loyalty or good will of the. holder-of a certificate, the central controlling authority-shall refer such case or oases to an Advisory Committee!&quot;for. inquiry arid report,- and where an Advisory Committee is satisfied that the continuance of a naturalization certificate is -centrary to&apos;the public good, such certificate shall be:*cancelled..38BUTRAL.ATATT3RALI2ATIOH CERTIFICATES.5.    *We recommend that a review:shall be:&quot;made of naturalisation certificates granted to.subjects of neutral-nations since August 1, 1914.
