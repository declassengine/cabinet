BOARD   OP  EDUCATIOif. 209H S PORT    JOS    JO it 3)    19 \, 8.During the past month the Department haB beon engaged, in consultation with the Treasury, in the preparation of a tensions Bill f*r Teachers in Public Elementary. Secondary, and other Grant-aided Softools.    I hope to bo able to introduce the Bill into Parliament at an early date.A Committee has been set up. in conjunction with other Departments, for the purpoao of advising the Board of Eduoaticn, the Board of Agriculture, and the Kinistry of Labour upon courses of education and training for officers and ex-cffioors of Eie MajestyTe Iforoes and for men of like standing ^ith a view to fitting them for suitable employment after the tfar.,The number of Classes in which Disabled Sailors and Soldiers are being trained in Public Teaching Institutions in oo-operation with tha Ministry of pensions is constantly increasing.    I have recently issued a Circular with a view to improving the adalnistra-tion of these Classes in the lij:ht of experience *  Classes for the training of jluUtion &quot;/orkera are also bein^ oarried on in a lar^e number of Schools under arran^emente made between my Department and the Ministry of. lauiitions .The administration of tlie revised arrangements made with the yiniotry of $rational Bervioe in regard to tie release for milijary service of Teachers in Elementary! Seoondary, and other Schools under the jurisdiction of ay Department is working eiaoothly owing to the    patriotic spirit displayed by the Teachers andto tho close co-operation whioh exists between the Loard and the local Education Authorities.The measures inaugurated last Autumn, at the request of the Board of Agriculture, for the establishment of Classes for Teachersin
rIn Gardening have met *ith very considerable success and there are already 165 of these Classes reoo-mioed by the Board *(b)       With,a view to meeting the deficiency in agricultural labour I have issued a Circular, at the request of the Einiatry of National Service, to Local IHduoation Authorities and Croverninft Lodica of Secondary Schools inviUna thorn to arra^e, as far as possible, for boys over tho a*,;e of 16 to be released from School for short periods during the Term or to be seat in groups into camps during the holidays to assist in agricultural operations.   The detailed arrangements ore beinfl carried cut by the iainistry of national Service in consultation with the Head Masters of feao Schools, and it is hoped that a very substantial number of boys -*ill be able to assist in this year&apos;a Harvest.The Scheme for the better examination of Secondary Schools in Eu;da;?id has boon further developed.   In falcs ;consultaticns have taken place with tho Central &quot;tfelah hoard whioh it is hoped **iTl lead to the introduction, of some much needed refor.a3 in connootiovi with tho Examination System in Welsh Intermediate Schools.A special One Yoax*e Course in thysical Training for women has beon established, *.?lth the concurrence of the Treasury, at University College, Reacting.   It is intended for students ,%&apos;ho I  have already completed t voir X**o Years&apos; Course at on ordinary 1   Training College for Teaoaers a:y\ its purooso is to provide for the teachers who &quot;fill be required for *ork in Continuation Schools and in connection with the otner physical and recreational development which may arise as a result of the Education Bill.Considerable progress was .mde with the Education Bill in Committee in the Kouse of Commons *
In the course of the Debates on the Education Bill it was pressed, upon me that some form of National provision should be made for the training of %oys for the sea service.    After   consulting  the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Board of Admiralty, and tho Board of Trade and learning that they were disposed to look favourably upon the suggestion X held a Conference at the Board of Education at which the various Government Departments interested, Local Education Authorities, Shipowners, and Seamen were represented.    In the result of the Conference I am appointing a Committee to prepare a draft of a National Scheme of Training for the Sea Service.
