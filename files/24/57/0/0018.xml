Political Intelligence Department,[June 29, 1918.] foreign office.SQlll    THE UNITED STATES AND THE ECONOMIC DEFENSIVE.IN view of pending discussious in the Imperial Conference regarding the Economic Defensive, it may be well to set down-what we know of the attitude of the United States towards this matter.. We have to consider four classes of opinion : popular opinion generally, the views of the commercial community, the attitude of responsible Government officials, and, finally, the views of the President himself.Popular feeling is becoming more and more bitterly anti-German. The American people are prejudiced against the,operations of big commercial combines and in favour of something which they vaguely think of as &quot;the principle of the open door.&quot; Opinion about the tariff is ill-defined, but the bulk, both of the working-classes and of the farmers, is probably decidedly protectionist, but moderately so in view of the extent to whieh a high tariff has become identified with &quot;big business.&quot; It is enough to say here that the inter-action of all these factors will probably make the American public ready to follow the President in the conclusion of comprehensive economic arrangements with the Allies so long as those arrangements bear the stanro of Government action in the interests of consumers.The views of the commercial community must be considered from two aspects : the willingness of business men to acquiesce in Government control, and their willingness to see that control used for political objects. As regards willingness to acquiesce in Government control, a good deal of impatience is naturally being manifested at present with Government war control over industry and trade, but on the whole this impatience is a good deal less than might have been expected. At the same time one peculiar fact must be remembered about the United States, namely, that the minds of business men have been accustomed to think in terms of a choice, not between Government control and no Government control, but between Federal control and State control, and between direct Federal control and indirect Federal interference. This explains the remarkable fact that the National Association of Manufacturers, a very conservative body, received at its annual meeting recently a report from its Committee on Inter-State Commerce and Federal Incorporation, which contemplated with approval a &quot;permanent enlargement of national control of our industrial and commercial life&quot; as preferable to the &quot;conflicting and restricting regulations&quot; of State laws and to &quot;the regulations of the Inter-State Commerce Commission, and all the difficulties inherent in such dual control over our arteries of trade/&apos; The Committee expressed the opinion that &quot;the efficiency of a larger degree of national administration will justify itself in post-bellum conditions.&quot; Moreover, the tariff has accustomed the minds of business men to close co-operation between Government and industry in international trade matters, and the high protectionism, which has always been the policy of &quot; big business,&quot; has to a certain extent been modified by the repeated insistence of economists and business men in recent years on the advantages of a flexible bargaining tariff leaving a wide margin to the Administration for the conclusion of commercial treaties. The more conservative business men are. indeed, still preoccupied with the necessity, in their view, of high protection on the old lines. For instance, Mr. Sabin, of the Guaranty Trust Company, said recently, &quot; 1 am convinced that we shall have to put up protective bars, as will every other belligerent nation after the war, rather than lower them, in international trade.&quot; But against this may be placed such comments as that of the &quot;Journal of Commerce &quot; in an editorial of the 30th April: &quot;After this war there really ought to be peace-making trade policies rather than the old assumption that one nation can profit by the losses of the other.&quot; On the whole, therefore, the business community is probably ready to acquiesce in any measure of Government control which can be represented as stimulating the efficiency of American industry, and as establishing arrangements of mutual advantage with other nations.There remains the question, however, whether commercial opinion will favour the use of such Government control for political or semi-political ends. As against our present enemies, the membership of the United States (Chamber of Commerce has, by an overwhelming majority, expressed itself ready for a boycott of Germany after the[367-25]
war if necessary, but too much importance should not be attached to an expression of opinion due mainly to a desire to hold up the hands of the national Administration, There has been little consideration of economic action against Germany after the war, but there has been a good deal of consideration of a possible preferential system between the Allies. It is becoming rather the custom to defend commercial policies on the ground that they will assist the Allies after the war. For instance, Mr. Montague, the lawyer who represented tho business community in the promotion of the Webb Bill, has recently defended the law as &quot;likely to [trove one of the aptest means that American statesmanship could possibly have devised for promptly rehabilitating devastated Europe, for perpetuating the commercial and financial ties now binding the United States to its Allies, and for bringing together that League of Nations by which alone lasting peace can be assured after the war.&quot; Mr. Farrell, as Chairman of the Foreign Trade Council, has also advocated extending preferential advantages to the Allies. On&apos;the whole, American business opinion will probably be impatient of any use of Government control against Germany after the war on purely sentimental or vindictive grounds, but they would projbably even on such grounds be prepared to approve some slight measure of sentimental preference to the Allies, and on commercial grounds they would view with approval any movement towards commercial arrangements of mutual advantage with the Allies at the present moment, leaving the conclusion of similar arrangements with Germany for subsequent consideration.Coming now to the views of responsible officials at Washington, we find very great interest in the whole idea of the Economic Defensive in various quarters. The Embassy has discussed the matter tentatively and confidentially with various departments, with the Chairman of the War Trade Board, with the Counsellor of the State Department, and with the Chairman of the War Industries Board. The Embassy has met with a really very cordial response. Mr. Baruch is especially interested in the question. He is in very close negotiation with us at present about the joint control and distribution of raw materials for war purposes, and similar arrangements for after the war are forming themselves in his&apos; mind in the course of these negotiations. The advantages of close co-operation with the Allies, and especially with the British Kmpire, are so obvious in the present sphere of war trade that they inevitably present themselves forcibly to the mind of officials in considering post-bellum conditions. Government circles in Washington are always very cautious, and moreover they are now so burdened with immediate war problems that we cannot expect the development of their views to be anything but gradual, but our tentative discussions permit us to say definitely that any proposals from the Allies, and especially from the British Empire, will be favourably considered. For the rest, Lord Reading has been of opinion that at the moment it is better to confine ourselves to informal discussions with American officials and thus to elicit from them an invitation to detailed deliberations rather than ourselves to issue such an invitation. This, however, would probably not apply to the communication to the officials concerned, and possibly to the Government as a whole, of any decisions reached or proposals formulated by the Imperial Conference.It is worth mentioning at this point the kind of guidance which is being given in public by American officials to unofficial opinion. Becently the Alien Property Custodian in a speech at Detroit delivered a most strongly worded attack on German penetration of American industry, and summed up his views in the words: &quot; I would divorce utterly and for ever all German capital from American industry.&quot; A report of the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce contains the following remark : &quot; The American Government, in conceit with the Governments of the other great nations, will see to it that Germany as a Government shall henceforth operate in the open. American business men, like, business men in the other great countries, must likewise see to it that all operations of German trade enterprises shall take place in the open, and bear a clear indication of having been made in Germany.&quot; The Chairman of the Tariff Commission, who has Jong been, in bis private capacity, a convinced free-trader, has delivered an address to the United States Chamber of Commerce which, while contemplating adequate protection for American industry, definitely proposes that there shall be no discrimination as between friendly nations in American tariff duties after the war, and conveys a warning against any reliance on tariffs to promote American, export trade.Lastly, we have to consider the Presidents own views. In the long run, his are the only views that matter, and while he will only act in close harmony with public opinion, his views will always be in advance of it. At the beginning of this year, the President laid down that one of the terms of the general peace should be &quot; the removal so far as possible of all economic barriers, and the establishment of an equality of trade
conditions among all the nations consenting to the peace and associating themselves for its maintenance&quot; ; that the United States does &quot;not wish to fight (Germany) either with arms, or with hostile arrangements of trade, if she is willing to associate herself with us and the other peace-loving nations of the world in covenants of justice and law and fair-dealing&quot;; but that if &quot; the German people .... after the war is over, continue to be obliged to live under ambitious and intriguing masters,.interested to disturb the peace of the world .... it might be impossible .... to admit Germany to the free economic intercourse which must inevitably spring out of the other partnerships of a real peace,&quot; It may be conjectured that subsequent events are inclining the President more and more to a contemplation of the necessity of an actual enforcement of this last warning. Pie has received strong recommendations from his advisers in favour of close and detailed consultations with the Allies as to how the warning could actually be enforced in case of necessity. He will be opposed to any vindictive or purely sentimental action against Germany; he will be opposed to any propagandist threats of boycott; he will want any discussions with the Allies to be conducted on the basis of a clean slate, unprejudiced by commitments such as those of the Paris Economic Conference; and he will always be extremely cautious. But the central point in his foreign policy, so far as he has developed it, is close co-operation with the British Empire, and he is probably very ready to authorise his advi&amp;ers to discuss these matters with British representatives. He does not, however, repose anything like equal confidence in French statesmen, and the difficulty of conducting anything like formal discussions without the inclusion of the French may be somewhat of an obstacle to bringing matters to a head.One additional factor in the situation and a most important one has been left to the last, namely, the attitude of Congress. It has been left to the last because Congress has no settled view as to the principle of the economic defensive. What has been said of popular opinion in this respect will be more or less true of Congress. It is therefore convenient to consider Congressional opinion in relation to the last point which we have to study, namely, the practical obstacle to United States co-operation offered by one great American interest. That interest is the cotton growers of the South. Congress will probably be prepared to pass any legislation which may be-recommended to it by the President for the extension of Government control over imports and exports to the transitional period after the war, and, indeed, in one or two cases, the Government has power under existing legislation to maintain its control for brief periods after the war such as six months, or. more vaguely, &quot;during a period of national emergency.&quot; But before the President could recommend such legislation he would certainly have to take into account the sentiments of the &quot;solid South.&quot; How great the difficulty presented by this consideration will be is too large a question to be considered in this memorandum, but roughly it may be said that the growth of the cotton manufacturing industry in the United States and the threatened decrease in cotton production will probably enable the Administration to assure the cotton growers of a very favourable market for their cotton within the United States itself. The South would of course not consent to be sacrificed to the cotton spinners of Few England; but, on the one hand, the idea of consuming the whole of the raw cotton produced in the United States in American factories is becoming a definite ambition in New England of which the political parties will be bound to take account, and on the other hand the existence of such an internal market, when combined with the competitive demand of the Allies, may in the eyes of the Southern growers be enough to ensure such high prices that they would not insist on adding the German demand to the other factors in the market. This is, of course, not intended as a forecast of what will actually be the state of the cotton market after the war, but only as an estimate of the kind of argument which might reasonably be relied on to induce the South to acquiesce in any general legislation laid before Congress.To sum up, the attitude of the United States towards the idea, of the Economic Defensive is not widely different from that existing in the other allied countries. Being, however, in an earlier stage of war conditions than the other countries, the United States needs to have its ideas precipitated by a. more or less definite lead from the other Allies. Moreover, as the chief preoccupation in the minds of American business men is naturally concerned with the intentions of the British Empire and with the prospects of obtaining British materials such as nickel, tin and wool in adequate quantities, the necessary lead can best be given by the British Empire, whose actual intentions are more liberal than American business men are at this moment sometimes inclined to suppose, and for whom Americans have at root a warmer feeling than for any other of their present Allies.
