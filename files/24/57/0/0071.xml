rif I:0j 0   ,J BNBMT-OWNBD PATENTS, TRADE MARKS AND D3SIGNS.. &apos;I circulate to the War Cabinet the following reply winch, sub-fJect to their approval, I propose to give to Sir Edward Carsonfs request ion down for oral answer in tho House of Commons on the above subject to-morrow (Wednesday), the-10th July.Board of Trade,9th July, 1918.A. H. STANLEY.8.  Sir Edward Carson, - To ask the President of the Board of Trade, whether he is in a position to make any announcement as to whether the practice&apos;of allowing enemy subjects to file specifications of inventions in the Patent Office is to be continued.Sir ALBERT STANLEY, - ,Though my Right Hon. Friend&apos;s question is limited to one par-ticular item of Patent Office practice, I think it will be convenient, that my reply should cover the whole question of the policy pursued during the war with regard to enemy owned patents, trade marks and designs.I have given this difficult and complicated matter very close consideration in consultation with my advisers.   As I have already informed the House, the practice hitherto followed by the patent Office in accepting enemy specifications and permitting the payment of fees, but refusing to grant new patents to alien enemies during the War, has, so far as I know, been in line with that adopted by all the Governments of the belligerent countries, though a quite recent decree of the President of the United States seems to indicate a partial change of attitude on the part of that country.    The general, practice has been founded on the principle, which in itself. I think.; is sound, that rights to industrial property are analogous to property rights rather than&quot; to trading rights.    The&apos;maintenance and creation, however, of rights of this kind require certain formalities, including registration, the payment of-fees, &apos;&amp;c.. and the current practice has the undoubted drawback that it necessitates the licensing of a certain amount of communication with alien enemies through neutral countries for -the-purpose&apos;of accomplishing these formalities. ....I am not prepared to say feat the original&quot; decision taken by the then Government was not perfectly sound at the time, but, having regard to all the circumstances, I have come to the conclusion that we have reached a stage in the war when the balance of advantage is in favour of putting an end to the communications referred to.   I have therefore decided to revoke the licence under which the payment and acceptance of fees is permitted, and I propose to take steps to vest ; in the Public Trustee the enemy interest in all forms of industrialu make a licence carefullyfollowed irrespective of any effect on the life of the patent produced by the suspension of payment of renewal fees.I ought, in conclusion, to allude to a difficulty \tfiich arises from the difference of practice between the United Kingdom and the United States as regards the payraait of patent fees.    In America payment takes the form of a single large payment at the outset, whereas in this country the initial payment is smaller, but renewal fees are payable in order to keep the patent alive.The result is that the decision which I have announced willwill result in a somewhat unsatisfactory position, and I am considering whether legislation may not be necessary &quot;to deal with it.
