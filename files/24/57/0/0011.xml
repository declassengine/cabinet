Repeated War Office, Teheran &amp; PunstertfpjjaoX.9927. July 1st, &apos;It appears that the purport of your 51117 today has been already wired by Marling to Dunsterforce.     The reply repeated to mo., (begins) I am unable to help Abadeh.    Even if petrol was available which is not the case hone of my armoured cars are in a condition to travel that distance,   (ends). I am wiring Dunstcrforce to know if he has any Ford Vans to spare and if he considers he can reach Abadeh and back with them, and to Marling to know if in Teheran there is any petrol available - but ? from the map the distance to Abadeh from Teheran is 400 miles.   On average roads in Persia in summer a Ford Van can do 15 miles to the gallon therefore a minimum of 540 lbs of petrol per van must be carried from Teheran for the double journey, I do not considor the proposition to be feasible as its load is only 600 lbs and as, in addition to petrol, following must be be carried fighting personnel levee ammunition, supplies for journey etc.
