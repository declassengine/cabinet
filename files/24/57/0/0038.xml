[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,]97SECRET.Printed for the War Cabinet. July 1918.NAVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION-No. 58. Week ended 29th June, 1918.NAVAL OPERATIONS.Mines have been laid in the North Sea and in the Heligoland Bight.North Sea.On 27th June three of our 55-ffc. coastal motor boats were in action with four enemy Flanders destroyers about seven miles north of Zeebrugge Mole.   The motor boats fired torpedoes area, and claim one hit.  All our boats have returned.. i On the evening of the same day four of our destroyers while patrolling off the Belgian Coast sighted eight German destroyers, which they engaged at 12,000 yards, closing to 8,000 yards, and four torpedoes were fired at the enemy vessels, but without success. A supporting force of monitors followed at utmost speed but did not sight the enemy. After the action had lasted a quarter of an hour the enemy was reinforced by three more destroyers, whereupon our destroyers fell back on the supporting force. The enemy, however, did not follow, and the action was then broken off. The motor boat of one of our destroyers was hit, causing slight splinter wounds to four men, but beyond this our ships sustained no damage.In addition to reconnaissances and patrols which have been carried out in various areas by R.A.F. machines employed on naval duty, the following raids have been made by our machines from Dunkirk : Date.Objective.Approximate weight ofbombs dropped.Results observed or remarks.June. 23rd     \ .23rd-24th 24th24th-25th25th26th &apos; . 26th-27th 27th28th28th-29th 29thBruges Docks...  &apos;.........Ostend Docks        .........Zeebrugge    ............Ostend Dock............Bruges Docks, Ostend Docks, La&quot;] &apos; Brugeoise Works, Maria Aelter ^ Aerodrome, Ostend-Bruges Canal f and Zeebrugge-Bruges Canal   ...JZeebrugge and Ostend DocksBruges Docks............Ostend Docks and ZeebruggeBruges Docks...Ghistelles     ...Bruges Docks...Westende BatteriesZeebruggeZeebrugge and Ostend Zeebrugge and OstendZeebrugge    ......GhistellesTotal weight ...Tons.61&quot;31 1* 2i3 1 121?,11 3 4Flits on east side of East Bassin.

on 27th june the hospital ship &quot; llandovery castle &quot; was torpedoed in a position about 116 miles W.S.W. from fastnet rock; 234 of the crew, nurses, &amp;c, out of a total of 258, are unaccounted for. the vessel was homeward bound from canada, and therefore had no sick or wounded on board. t!&apos; , ion 23rd june two allied machines from otranto reconnoitred cattaro, and, after shooting down one enemy machine, returned safely to their base.on 26th june four enemy machines bombed otranto, but caused only slight material damage and no casualties.on the same day allied macWes from valona and otranto carried out raids on durazzo. direct hits were made on the seaplane jetty, and buildings adjoining the seaplane base were set on fire.   all our machines returned safely.*CAsufilties. on 26th june the destroyers &quot; vancouver &quot; and &quot; wessex &quot; collided while exercising with the 1st battle cruiser squadron in the north sea. six men were killed and three injured and both vessels were severely damaged and are now under repair.the rear-admiral, buncrana, has reported that submarine d.6 failed to appear at her rendezvous at midnight on 25th june. search has been carried out by all available vessels, but ho trace of her has been found, neither has she answered any W/t signals. It is therefore presumed that she is lost.attack upon enemy submarines.Submarines during the week under review 12 or 13 large enemy submarines have been located, operating, including three of the converted &quot; deutschland &quot; type. the submarine which has been Operating off the north american coast is thought to be homeward bound, the other two of the &quot; deutschland &quot; type being outward bound. of the remaining large boats; there is probably one working in the vicinity of the canary islands and the others have been operating chiefly in the entrance to the english channel. there has been persistent submarine activity off the north-east coast of england, where the enemy appears to be using his flanders flotilla and has done considerable damage.Actions the following table shows the number of actions between allied craft and enemvwith enemy submarines which are reported to have taken place in all waters during recent weeks, s    annea. and the nature of the craft which have been engaged; and also the number of submarines which have been destroyed as the result of such actions: 	Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		June 8th.

The percentage of losses to sailings in United Kingdom Overseas trades during the week is 3-23 as against -26 in the previous week, in Cross-Channel trades is -09 as against -16, and in Coasting trades is -21 as against no losses last week, Avhile as regards all United Kingdom trades the percentage is 1-29 as against -15 in the previous week.The Table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all merchant vessels, Foreign areas ;as well as British, sunk, damaged and unsuccessfully attacked in the last two weeks by in which enemy craft and by mine, classified according to areas. vessels lost.It will be seen from this Table that during the week under review there has been some increase in enemy activity, particularly in the Atlantic and in the North Sea. On the other hand, the shipping in the Irish Sea was immune from attack, and in the Mediterranean there are reports of only two attacks which resulted in the sinking of two foreign vessels sailing independently of convoy.The number of British and Foreign merchant vessels sailing&apos;in organised Convoy vessels which completed their voyages during last week, and the losses sustained whilst in such convoyed.

ENEMY MINES.    -mroelaying. Enemy mines have this week again been laid off the East Coast of Scotland and also .C &apos; in the Harwich area, the extension of the former minefield in a south-easterly direction having been located by the cutting of a mine by a paravane. The enemy would appear to be concentrating all his larger minelaying submarines off the East Coast of Scotland, where the minefield has now assumed considerable proportions, 120 mines having been cleared in open waters since the operation commenced in December, 1917, and some 30others from the coastal areas.*   &apos;   rDuring the week under review three of H.M. Ships have cut mines with paravanes, one in the vicinity of the Heligoland Bight and two in the minefield above referred to. The latter vessels must have passed right through the mined area and were undoubtedly saved by their paravanes.casualties, The following Table shows the number of enemy mines destroyed and British vessels sunk by mine in Home Waters (including the Havre and Cherbourg areas) in recent weeks:

No enemy ships have entered or left Rotterdam.FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. Russia.The Naval Attache reports that Captain Shastni, who was S.N.O. of the Baltic Fleet and pro-Entente, has been executed at the instigation of Trotsky.The torpedo boats which remained at Helsingfors are being used by the Germans for sweeping up mines.Admiral Sablin remains at Moscow for the present in hopes of organizing the transport of submarines from the Baltic; via the Volga, to the Black Sea for operations against the enemy.Using Eisk (Sea of Azov) as a base, Russian light craft including a gunboat have been interfering with German shipping, and in order to deal with this menace the Germans are reported to have landed east of Kertch, whereupon the crews of the Russian ships at Eisk abandoned their ships and escaped to Ekaterinodar.Definite information has now been received that one Russian Dreadnought and five destroyers at Novorossisk put to sea on June 17th, and have arrived at Sevastopol. Of the remaining ships at Novorossisk, the other Dreadnought battleship was sunk by torpedoes from T.B.D. &quot; Kertch &quot; in 22 fathoms, eight destroyers have been partially destroyed and two others have proceeded southwards to Tuapse.Naval Staff,iih July, 1918.[Appendices.
