246 12W CM IIrish Land (Provision for Sailors andSoldiers) Bill.7 Qu hMEMORANDUM.The object of this Bill is to facilitate the settlement of ex-soldiers upon the land in Ireland through the instrumentality of the Irish Land Purchase Acts. These Acts have been in operation for many years and form a complete working code under which the Land Commission and Congested Districts Board are empowered to purchase land and distribute the same by way of resale amongst tenants and others, and to take such steps as they think proper for the benefit, improvement and equipment of the land resold.A large quantity of land purchased under these Acts is at present vested in the Land Commission and Congested Districts Board, and other land is in process of sale to these bodies. The bulk of this land has already been hypothecated to pro-spective purchasers, particularly in the congested districts of the west of Ireland, but some of it will certainly be available for the purposes of the Bill. It will no doubt be necessary for the Land Commission to purchase additional land for these purposes, and the extent of such purchases will depend upon the number of suitable men who apply to the Land Commission. The opera-tions authorised by the Bill will involve certain expenditure from public funds, but, seeing that successive Governments have pledged themselves to the completion of Irish land purchase and that such expenditure is incidental to its completion, the present Bill should, it is submitted, be regarded merely as one which, for a most meritorious object, accelerate liabilities that must, sooner or later, be incurred in the completion of land purchase.The modifications of the Land Purchase Acts which are proposed by the Bill are comparatively simple, and may be summarised as follows : (1) To make Irishmen who have &quot;served in the present war qualified to purchase land from the Land Commission and Congested Districts Board in the same way as. tenants or proprietors of small holdings are now qualified. Under the existing, law such tenants or proprietors have a preferential claim.120-1a
(2) To treat the settlement of ex-service men on the land in the same way as the resettlement of congested estates is treated. The existing Acts contain special pro-visions with regard to the purchase and resale of congested estates for enabling such estates to be acquired compulsorily and otherwise by the Land Commission at prices paid in money instead of 3 per cent, stock, and for relaxing the general requirement of the Acts that&apos; an estate must be resold at no less price than was paid for it by the Commission.(3) To place the administration of the Bill in the hands of the Land Commission exclusively. The admini-stration of the Land Purchase Acts in the nine western counties is in the hands of the Congested Districts Board and not the Land Commission.As it will be desirable, in some instances, to settle the ex-service men in groups of colonies or holdings, the Bill incor-porates section 2 of the Small Holdings Colonies Act, 1916, so as to enable the Land Commission to promote co-operation in the working of the holdings.The Evicted Tenants (Ireland) Act, 1907, is a most valuable precedent for the present Bill. That Act provided for the settlement on the land of the evicted tenants, who were popularly described as the &quot;wounded soldiers of the land campaign.&quot;As distinct from the Land Purchase Acts, there is a series of Irish Labourers Acts under which cottages, gardens, &quot;and allotments can be provided for men who do not wish to make farming their sole occupation.
