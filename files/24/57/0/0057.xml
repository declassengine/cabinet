(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY - OF HIS BRITAT1NIC MAJESTY^ GQVISRMMT),The Works Construction Sub-Commit tee of&apos; the War priorities Committee have submitted to the latter body a Memorandum asking for the reconsideration of the approval given by the War priori-ties Committee to two extensive schemes requiring considerable labour for constructional work, in view of the general shortage of labour of thi        criptier now obtaining throughout the Country.The two schemes in question are (a) the erection of a Factory at Billingham for the manufacture of Synthetic Nitrogen and (b) work in connexion with the extension of the British Dye Industry.The Works Construction Sub-Committee were of the opinion that in view of the existing shortage of labour and material these two schemes could only be. proceeded with at the corres-ponding expense of immediately urgent war work and that for this reason the approval previously given to them should be recon-side red .(a) Billingham Factory for Nitrogen..This scheme provides for the erection, at an estimated cost of  4,000,000 Of a Factory for the production of 50,000 tons of Nitric Acid per annum by the fixation of atmospheric -Nitrogen.   It was considered by the War.priorities Committee at their 12th Meeting on 1st February, 1918.   The Committee had before them the following arguments in favour of the Scheme. Nitrogen in some form is essential for the. manufacture of all service explosives.   For the great bulk of our supply we are entirely dependent .on Chile, and although the estimated output from the proposed factory would only be l&amp;j^-oF the total re-quirements, it would save tonnage to the extent of some.5 ships Of 6,000 tons per annum and would also do away pro.tanto with the percentage liable to be lost through Submarine risks.   The scheme could also be used, if necessary, to bring pressure on Chile through the threat of the loss of her English Markets for Nitrates,   in peace time the. output of the factory would readily .be absorbed for Agricultural purposes and should assist in keeping down the price .of Chilean Nitrate.In view of the foregoing considerations the War Priori-ties Committee approved the scheme.   The Treasury, however, &apos; withheld their financial sanction till the scheme had been further considered by a Committee under Lord. Colwyn appointed for this purpose.   This Committee recommended, that the scheme should be proceeded with and Treasury sanction was given on 22nd March,,Substantial progress has, it is understood, been made with the initial stages and demands are now coming in for labour and material as stated above, and it was in view-ofwar cabinet.O.T. 5Q56,(a) ERECTION OF NITROGEN FACTORY AT BILLING-HAM.(b) EXTENSION OF THE BRITISH LYES INDUSTRY.(Memorandum by the War Prioritiea Committee*)
these demands, which conflict with other urgent v/ar work, that the Works Construction Sub-Committee submitted the case for reconsideration.(b) Extension of the British DyeeIndustry. -The War Cabinet decided in October 1917 (War Cabinet 247 - Minute&quot;8) that the Bye Industry should be classed as a War Industry for all purposes.  ; , . i .The scheme for extending the Dye industry was discussed by the War priorities Committee in February 1918 and it was decided that it should be proceeded with; the Ministry of Munitions undertaking to find the steel, required (13th Meeting Minute 4.)As in the case of the Nitrogen Factory Scheme demands   -for Constructional labour and material haye- how begun to come in.   The Constructional labour required will be, it is estimated, from 1,500 to 2,000 men continuously employed for two years., For the same reasons.which.actuated them in the case of the Nitrogen Factory, the Works Construction Sub-Committee submitted the Dye Scheme for reconsideration.,The above two schemes were:.reconsidered by the War-Priorities Committee at their Eighteenth Meeting on 5th July,i9i8.  - .The War priorities Committee considered that the grounds on which they gave their approval to the above Schemes in the first instance had not substantially altered, although the difficulties attending their execution had to some extent increased.   These grounds they felt to be&apos; of such importance -in the case of the Dye Industry, of such unique and paramount importance - that they decided that the Schemes should be pro-ceeded with, as War work, in their appropriate order of priority.   As regards the shortage of Constructional labour, the War priorities committee hope that measures for the better co-ordination and conservation of the building labour in this Country, which, it is understood, the Ministry of National Service propose to put into force shortly, will substantially improve the situation.11, Pall Kali,8th July, 1918.,
