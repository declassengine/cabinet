Copy of letter from Lord Cowdray to Sir G. Cave.47 Parliament Street,WESTMINSTER., S.W.3rd July, 1918.Dear ^ir George,It is approaching 4 months 3ince this subject was first discussed between you, -Mr, Boris? Law, Sir Clarendon Hyde and myself.As a result of the discussion you wrote me on the 20th March that the Government would take steps to protect the oil fields against indiscriminate drilling, rot only during the continuance of the Defence of the Realm Regulations * hut after the war.As requested by you we have been pushing matters as hard as we could, and the negotiations with tho Ministry of Munitions are virtually settled.   The drillers are actually arriving this week from the United States and the delay in proceeding with the proposed legislation to protect the oil fields is becoming really serious.    Pending tho understanding arrived at with the Government being given effect to, active work cannot be commenced.It only remains nov for you to inform me, if you kindly will, what is the form in which protection for the oil fields is to be afforded, and when the proposed legisla-tion will be introduced. 1I am sorry to trouble you so soon after your return to England, but the urgency of the. matter is my excuse.Yours sincerely,(Signed)      CQWDRAY.The fit. Eon,Sir George Cave,  .C..M.P, HOME OFFICE,&apos; S.u. (1)
