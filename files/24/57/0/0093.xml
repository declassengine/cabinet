(1)10th July, 1918,Sir. &apos;I beg to submit the following Report on the work of the Pood Production Department for the week ended 9th July, 1918?-The^fea^er,The hot dry weather, prevalent throughout the country during the past week, does not appear to Have damaged cereal crops ta the extent that might have been expected, and in Lancashire4and Cheshire it is stated that the outlook for oats has been improved by the lack of rain, which has checked the growth of straw &quot;and will probably save a great many fields from being laid later on&quot;.    On the .6ther hand pastures are practically dried up, and roots are suffering severely on account of the prolonged drought.Hay is being&apos;8tacked in excellent condition, though the crop generally speaking, is reported to be light.LOGALimpRGABJSATION DIV xSION.

Inspections of Land.(l) On July 4th .an inspection Was made of crops an newly ploughed grass land in Dorset.    There have been few failures from wireworm in the county, and apart from the dry weather, which has damaged all spring sown crops, the results on the land broken up by order of the Committee are quite satisfactory. The actual failures from all causes in the county are less than 5%.(2)   On the 6th July an inspection of crops on recently broken up grass land was made in Essex.    No failures of the wheat crop were seen, but many promised a yield of from 5-7 quarters per .acre*.    Among the noteworthy crops seen were wheat at Down Hall, on land which in August last year was derelict and bush-grownj
wheat on very poor clay soil near WoodhamFerrlex irhlch was broken up and fallowed In 1917j   wheat and potatoes on poor heavj loam near Felstead, which had been fallowed in 1917;   and wheatl and potatoes on a good loam at Terling broken up from old grass last winter.    Generally, the wheat and bean crops In the eastern! part of Essex are now most promising, the hay crop has been good and has been secured in first-rate condition.    Oats and barley, on.the other haa4, are moderate to poor, potatoes are mufch in nee of rain, roots are poor in. most cases, and grass has been burnt up.Insect Pests in Wheat and Oats.   Districts In Cheshire affected tlin i i........iimriiiii iiHiniiufiwiDirniiWinnnwiw rTi Tnim m rr- mm  rr - ir&quot;n&quot;------ t -ior-n rrthe wheat bulb fly have been examined, and, although severe cases have occurred, the damage this year Is comparatively slight and 1 marked contrast to that which occurred last year. Spring attack by frit fly on the young oat plant have also been less severe tha last, year, and the few bad oases which have been reported have al been due to sowing too late. Summer attacks on the grain are under investigation.LABOtJR DIVISION.Agriculturists and Miltftagy Service.  arrangements have been made with the Ministry of National Servloe whereby county and district officers shall be entitled to apply to the Executive Committees for agricultural vouchers.

9 9 o&amp; .v (vInformation received from the Ministry of National Service shows that up to the 29th June, 20,118 men have been posted for military service front agriculture since April 29th last. Harvest Labour.   All County Agricultural Executive Committees have been informed of the sources of additional labour likely to be available for harvest work, and urged to organise whatever forms of part-time labour are available in their respective areas.    Committees have been Instructed to approach the local authorities, chief constables and large employers of labour, with-a view to releasing as much local labour as possible during the coming harvest.The War Office have now agreed to grant one month&apos;s agricultural furlough to certain men stationed in Command Depots. It is hoped that one or two thousand useful men will thus be made available for one month.    The Department will arrange for the distribution of these men in districts where harvest labour is most urgently required.Soldier Labour.   The total number of soldiers now out on farms is59,423, 63 additional men having been sent out during the week.Prisoners of War.   11 additional agricultural prisoner eampshave been opened during the week, making the total number ofprisoners now employed on farm or drainage work as followsProm 248 agricultural camps...............   14,572Employed from other camps.................    1,008Combatant prisoners lodged on farms.......       560.15,940  .Released aliens employed in agriculture...    2,083157025   ,6,065 additional prisoners for 101 other agricultural schemes have now been voted to the Department.    All these schemes are under consideration by the War Office, and it is hoped that the necessary depots will be opened during the next two or three weeks..War Agricultural Volunteers. The Ministry of National Service have been unable, to extend for a further period the arrangement
that men otherwise qualified can apply for enrolment as War Agricultural Volunteers even, though they aro already under call J military service.    Arrangements have however been made that calli up notices shall not be issued-to men of the new military age unti ten days after their medical examination in order that they may ha an Opportunity of applying, for enrolment as War Agricultural Volunteers.. Women1s Br an oh. Recruiting.,   The results of. concentrating the Headquarters recruiting staff in London have been that over 1,000 recruits have-enrolled during the week.The experiment has been tried of visiting the suburbs, On Priday,;evening three cars went to Clapham, and a meeting was held. from, each car in a different part of the district.     This effort yielded 65 recruits..Members of the Land Army took part in a rally and procession at East Ham on Saturday.   t Meetings were addressed and 144 recruits were enrolled.     A meeting was subsequently held in Hyde Park, where the crowd&apos;was unusually enthusiastic and 27 women were recruited,Recruiting tours are now in progress in Lancashire, C Cheshire and Yorkshire, and a week&apos;s recruiting campaign will commence in-Birmingham on.Friday to coincide with the visit of the Ministry of Labour War Services Exhibition.Rallies have been held this week at Colwyn Bay, East Ham Penrith, Reading&apos;and Altrincham,Training.

Twenty- three binders were cona during the week ended 6th July making a total,of 3.866 consigned ,to date.&apos;&apos;   SUPPLIES DIVISION...ii ii i n i mi i .0)    %........ mi i  n   iiFertilisers.   The allocation of supplies of fertilisers is pr satisfactorily, and arrangements have been made for the supply tf Scotland and Ireland from English works of tho.quantities agreed , upon between the respective Departments.    In the case of sulphate of ammonia, about 24,000 tons have been licensed for delivery up t* the end of August, against a total application for England and Wale in the same period amounting te 35,000 tons.    This figure includes about 10,000 tons^for use in the manufacture of compound manures. In the case of superphosphate, makers have been able in most cases to meet their customers1 demands under the General Lioence which allows them to deliver at a cost not exceeding 12.6d. per ten. In the case of basio slag the applications frlglnally sent in by English makers amounted to 576,000 tons for England and Wales, apart from quantities required for allocation to Scotland and Ireland.    All these applications have now been dealt with the total quantity licensed for delivery up to 31st May next
amounting t  460,000 tona^.    The production of basic a lag is being well maintained, and it is anticipated that the output for this year will substantially exceed that of the year 1917-18. binder-.&apos;Twine.  Arrangements are now under discussion for the BUpply of binder twine for the, 1919 harvest.    The price af hemp, however, has materially increased since the beginning of this1 year, and an increase in the price of binder twine next season appears Inevitable. The- requirements of Agricultural Executive Committees and dealers for the current Season are being met from stocks at the disposal of the Department, which seem ample to meet the probable demand. Sulphate efn flopperc   The sale of sulphate of copper during the pact month has been small, and the stocks in the hands Of makers are in excess of any demand which is, likely to arise. Silea.    A-good deal of interest has been aroused in the country with regard to silos by the issue of the Department&apos;s pamphlet&apos;, of which about 3,&apos;500 copies have now been circulated. Drawings have been supplied in a number of: cases to land owners &quot;and farmers who appeared prepared to.build,, and at the .present time 15 silos are in course ^f erection as a direct outcome cf the action of the&quot; Department.    The supply of cement, of which the War Office has recently taken control, is giving rise ta difficulty in certain cases, as the demand for military and naval purposes is very great.       . v.i/-Seed Oats.   The following statement gives the actual quantity ofseed oats&quot;distributed by the Department during the past season. &apos;These figures do not include supplies sent to Prance.Irish ...      ....   18,898j quarters -Scottish..     ...      4,591       &quot;Manx     ... -9,014    .  &quot; vTatal ..&quot;-&quot;32,5031    -   ...... .Wart Disease of Potatoes. &apos; Up to the present the number ofapplibahts who-have entered their crops of immune varieties forinspection In&apos;response to the Department^ offer is 267,representing 2,479 acres.
A number of new Infected Areas (chiefly boroughs) have been certified in Staffordshire, and the Wart Disease of Potatoes^ Order of 1918 comes Into force in these areas at once.   The dise&amp;s is very prevalent throughout the county and it is proposed to schedule the whole of Staffordshire as an &quot;Infected Area&quot;. Potato Spraying - During the past week potato blight has appeared to a limited extent both on early and maincrop varieties at a few additional centres in North Wales, viz:- two areas in S.B. Carnarvonshire and one in Anglesey.At a place near Ryde in the Isle of Wight a few plants ol white &quot;Beauty of Hebron&quot; have been found to be affected by blight, but the surrounding potato plots and those examined in other parts ,of the Island are healthy.   The weather is still very dry there aril no epidemic is to be feared-so long as this continues. , Although rain is badly needed most potato crops in the Isle of Wight are looking well notwithstanding the dry weather.   Particularly striki Is the greater- vigour of fseed,f- obtained from a more northerly source or from heavier soil in the. Island in comparison with home saved fseed!.     On the lighter soils poor &apos;seedf has been severely affected by the drought,*the haulm being stunted and the.foliage discoloured.No further reports of the presence of potato blight have been received from S.W. England,, specimens received from various parts of the country having been affected by other diseases or by various forms of constitutional weakness which the dry spell has made more evident than usual. vNumerous demonstrations in potato spraying have been given during the past week and have attracted large audiences. Revised Testing of Seeds Order.   Except for a number of enquiries arising out of a misreading of. the revised Order, very few comments have up to the present reached the department regarding
tho alterations make in the Order.    So far as can be ascertained the Sood Trade is likely to accept the new Order In the same spirit as they did the original, although they are working under considerable disadvantages at the present time.    A few seedsmen criticise the inclusion of cereals, but they do not appear to express the general opinion of the trade.     In any case, provision has boon made to allow for the Cereals Clause, or any other Clause, to be varied or even temporarily suspended, so that by closely observing the working of the Order the Department should be able to administer it in an equitable and clastic fashion. Shipment of Seeds from Overseas.   Returns have been obtained from all the principal coed firms in tho United Kingdom of the quantity of seeds they will probably wish to import from overseas during the next twelve months, together with the probable dates and ports of shipment.     These particulars have been summarised and submitted to the Ministry of Shipping with a view to special arrangements being made for freight space to beprovided at the loading ports, as and when required. &apos;  Similar arrangements wore made last season, and the results proved most satisfactory.I am,Sir,Your obediont Servant,Director-General.The Rt. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, M.P., President of the Board of Agriculture and.Fisheries.
