WEEK ENDING 1st JULY, .19180(1)   TOi ARlilliS OK THE ^SCTIT^POHT.Owing to the weather conditions observation of the enemy&apos;s movement has been extremely difficult and in con-sequence very little information has been obtainedcIndications are still vague and the position obscure.Aerial activity has been greatest opposite the 1st Army Front,(2)   WITH HAVAL FORCES,Throughout this period the weather has been favourable for carrying out a full programme of operations.Sightings by our aircraft shew that enemy submarines have been active whilst his aircraft also have shewn activity considerably abgve normalcAeroplanes5 Seaplanes and Airships on anti-submarine duties have carried out a large number of patrols daily. 11 Submarines were bombed and 5 Mines destroyed.   The usual reconnaissances ov3r enemy bases were carried out daily0A large number of bombing raids have been carried out by squadrons from DUNKIRK, 39-^ tons c-f bombs being dropped on Naval objectives.     Our bombing formations were frequently and heavily attacked by the enemy, and many severe engagements have resulted, during which 4 32S SA, were destroyed and 16 driven down out of control.    Hostile vessels have been attacked with bombs on two occasions,10 of .our machines are missing and&apos;two others collided during a combat and were destroyed^The enemy bombing operations against our aerodromes in the DUNKIRK area have been resumed, ar.d on the night. 29/30th, considerable damage was cauBod in an attack by the enemy with 8 machines on B3RGUES aerodrome.,(3)    IHIEIPB^Bl^ FORCE.In all during the week 30 attacks were carried out on the following 15 objectives in Germany:-
In the course of these operations 9 energy aircraft were brought down and 2 driven out of contr 10 of our machines are missing.(4) fim- hokje&apos; toroes .Nothing of outstanding interest to report.

There are no signs of any increase in the air strength of the enemy, and the increase of accommodation in the lam - Hoye   - ISesle Area is maintained.The marked increase both of machines and activity in the Somme Area may presumably be connected,with the increase in accommodation south of Peronne, which may indicate the return of those flights withdrawn for the Aisne Battle,It is important, to note that our Bombing Squadrons have this week encountered,, for the first time, considerable opposition from the enemy, machines, which appear to have been withdrawn from the front line for the express purpose of.4fighting....our raiding machines,   . . . ,Enemy *s attitude.There &quot;:&apos;.as been a considerable increase of scout activity during the period.(2) ITALIA!?

TECHNICAL DEPARTMENT.   ,(1) EnginesTrials have &quot;been continued of the Dragonfly and liberty engines.   In both cases no serious difficulties have developed and the results may be described as very favourable.The Wasp engine is not yet out of the experimentalstage.It has been decided to develop a large 6 cylinder vertical engine of about 600 Hop. It will be on the lines of the German engines but of much higher power,       c it will be economical in petrol and it is hoped very reliable;   it will also be easy to produce and will make use of production- facilities of a kind which have not hitherto been employed fully in the production of aero-plane engines.     On the other hand it will be rather heavy for its power.     Its fi^ld of use will be long distance machine in which the economy of petrol will to some extent counter-balance the weight of the engine.The close attention of tha Department is being given to removing the troubles in the Arab angina which is recognised as one of the most urgent problems which we have to face.     The results are so far satisfactory but it cannot be said yet that we are absolutely clear of this problem,(2) AeroplanesThe second Handley Page &quot;V&quot; type machine is being erected and.it is expected it will b-e flying in about 14 days time,(3) ExperimentalThe following large questions other than purely technical points are engaging the attention of the Exp e r i men t al Bran c h:-(a) Forecasting the wind at great heights and the use offorecasts in navigation.   Arrangements have been made for the establishment of Stations for getting the necessary upper air date for this purpose.     These Stations will be situated in Ireland, England and Prance.     The Meteorological Office will analyse the data which are of a new kind, with a view to establishing a proper system of forecasting which must be based on an examination of the data extending over a. period of sev-ral months.     A special Experimental Section and Station are being set up to deal with the use of these results in navigation and bombing.(b) A new Station is being started and it is expected willbe in full working order in about 3 weeks time for dealing with the problem of defence against aeroplane attacks by night, by the co-operation of sound location with defending aeroplanes.   Considerable progress has been made at existing Experimental Stations in the first of these directions;   the new place will b^ entirely devoted to this work.P.T.0
We are keeping in close touch with the Grand Fleet on this subject, in.order to keep on right lines the Experimental work which is necessary to deal with the  technical points involved.   Apart from the large question of the production of the right type of meohin.es this investigation oovers such points as range finding from aeroplanes (a r*nga-finder has &quot;been produced which promises to he very good), methods of visual signalling from aero-planes to ships and the like.
