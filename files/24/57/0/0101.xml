&apos;&quot; Confidential.. , Br^uucTnl[mfjfy MEMORANDUM   TO   THE   WAR   CABINET *FROM   THE   MINISTER   OF   INFORMATION.ernment.I -Twiynrmlna of Leaflets behind the Enemy Lines.HALL Ei^rflerstand that It has been left to the discretion of the Army Council to determine the practice to be followed by . this country In regard to the dropping of pamphlets by aircraft behind the enemy lines, and that in view of the attitude taken up by the German Government, aeroplanes are no longer used for that purpose, but that balloons are.to some extent employed.I take it that the German Government has.its own reasons for not wishing to use aeroplanes for purposes of propaganda, but it is unnecessary for me to enquire into those reassns. The vital fact from the standpoint of this Government is that in view of the enemy morale, propaganda by aeroplane is one- of the most valuable forms, if not the most valuable form, of propaganda which can now be employed,,     (I attach an extract from the &quot;News Transmitted through the Wireless Stations of the Italian Government&quot; ( 9the July 1918) illustrating the use which the Italians are making of aeroplanes for propaganda purposes.)The use of balloons can never achieve more than a partial success.     ;&apos;hat is Imperatively required is the aeroplane, which can fly low and drop pamphlets in the places where it is intended that they should fall.I submit most strongly that the employment of the aeroplane for propaganda purposes should be resumed, increased, and con-tinued. &apos;&apos; &apos; . &apos;The Director of Propaganda in Enemy Countries entirely concurs in these views.BEAVERBROOK.12th. July, 1918.
Serial Ho. 5320. July 9th, 1918.ADMIRALTY   PER   WIRELESS   PRESS.NEW!:: TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE VTRELESS STATIONS OF THE ITALIAN GOVERN- IENT.Amongst Italian aviation records of the last Austrian offensive especially noteworthy is a flight which was made over Agram on the morning of June ?A for scouting and also for propaganda purposes to tell the population of Austria&apos;s defeat.     Both objects were fully gained.    Plight-Lieut. Locatelli dropped leaflets for crowds gathered in Apr-am1 s chief squares, announcing the brotherhood in arms of the Chekhov-Slovaks, who fought side by side with the Italians. The enemy fire was severe against our aeroplanes between Grado and Lubiana but there was none at Agram, so Locatelli was able to fly verylow.-TN/15/9.
