memorandum by the president of the board of trade. ^/L   a. kestbict10n OP TH  carrying ON 0? BUSINGSby mm alms m&amp;R m wab.as regards the conduct of businesses by enemy aliens after the war it is proposed that legislation should be introduced to prevent businesses of any kind (including      course banks) being carried on in the united kingdom wholly or mainly for the benefit or under the control of enemy aliens for a period of (three) (five) years after the war.certain exceptions of a limited nature will be necessary to exclude from&quot;the operation of this legislation persons who, although subjects of enemy states, are of friendly race and have been well disposed towards the interests of this country and our allies during the war.   it will also no doubt be desirable to except businesses which have been allowed to continue during the war after the board of trade advisory committee have re-ported that there are special reasons for not winding them up.on the other hand it will be necessary to apply more stringent provisions in certain occupations and it is proposedcapacity in the business of an enquiry agentit is proposed that enemy aliens should also be excluded from the ownership of mineral rights or land but the question of ownership of land is one with which the board of trade are not directly concerned.b. amdlttt of tila trading with m MM acts.some amendments of the trading with the mernj acts will be desirable in order to deal satisfactorily during the war with businesses carried on before the war by partnerships between british subjects and persons resident in an enemy country in which the enemy interest was nredominant.   some of these businesses have escaped the winding-up provisions of the trad-ingwith the i&amp;emy acts wing to a decision of the courts thatmethod nay not have effected so complete an elimination of the enemy interest as would be effected by &amp; winding-up and it is therefore proposed to give the board of trade power to wind them up notwithstanding the termination of the partnership and notwithstanding that the enemy interest in the business may have been transferred or been vested in the custodian and realised by him sizce the war.  winding up at the present time may cause hardship to british allied or neutral suoiects who have bought the enemy interest  and against whom there may be no suspicion of intending to resume the previous enemy connection legislation should therefore confer a discretion (not an obligation) on the itoard of trade to wind up.
Difficulties havo arisen in dealing with shares in a British company held bv or on behalf of &quot;a neutral company which is under German control and it would be  desirable that the Board of Trade should have power to vest in the Custodian and direct a sale of securities or other property belonging to a Company which appears to them to have been carried oh immediately before or at any time since the war wholly or mainly for the benefit of enemies or enemy subjects or in&apos;which a majority of the shares were held by enemies or enemy subjects.   Company to be defined so as to include a Company incorporated in a foreign country.   Such legislation might create &quot;difficulties with neutral countries and the Board of Trade are in coiiimunication with the Foreign Office on the subject.Certain minor Amendments of the Trading with the Enemy Acts are also proposed, mainly in order to facilitate the coin-plete and final disposal of Companies carrying on business here &quot;the shares of which&quot; are owned by enemy aliens.   These proposals may be summarised as follows:-(a) Tower to enable the Board of Trade to make an Order requiring a Company to be wound-up.Under the present Acts the business is wound-up, but in order to enable&quot;a winding up of a Company to take place a pet-ition for winding up has to be presented to the Court.    It will simplify the procedure to enable the Board of Trade to reauire a Company &quot;to be&apos;wound-up without having to present a petition to the Court.-(b) Power to enable the Board of Trade to make an Order requiring a business to be wound up notwithstanding that it may have ceased active operations, the order to operate for the purpose of realising and distributing; the assets of the business.Questions have been raised as to the jurisdiction of the Board of- Trade under existing legislation.(c) Power to enable the Board of Trade to require&apos;a com-pany to be struck off the Register and finally dissolved without any right to apply for the restoration of the name of the Company to the Pollster, with a provision for an--outstanding; debts due to&quot;the Company and any outstanding pro-perty of tlie company being vested in the Official Receiver,This is desirable in order to prevent the resusci-tation by any means of a Company the business of which has &quot; been wound-up.(d) A provision to validate distributions which have been made in a few&apos;cases among shareholders of a Company without an Order having been obtained for ths winding-up of the Company before a decision of the Court that such&apos;distribu-tions could not legally be made under existing legislation.(e) A provision to enforce the determination and dis-charge of liens claimed on property vested in the Custodian.
0. PRIVATE PROPERTY BliJ-OlvGOTJ TO mm ALIENS.It )ias not hitherto been the practice as a general rule to sell or vest in the Custodian private property belonging to-enemy aliens, and Prance and Belgium&quot;would probably object to any general disposal of such private property on the ground &quot;that it would place their&quot;property how&apos;under Gorman&apos;control in greater jeopardy than&quot;it is in at present.   There is under existing legislation fall power to vest and sell any property belonging to any enemy alien, but the information as regards the property of enemy aliens who are not resident in enemy countries is not com-plete,A Committee which has recently been meeting at the Foreign Office under the Chairmanship of Sir.A*Wiring will probably ma Ice recommendations for legislation with a view to securing information about such property and pre-venting its transfer without proper authority in cases of substance.A.H.STAHLEI.Board of Trade,9th July, 191
