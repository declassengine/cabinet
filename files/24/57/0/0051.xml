PRIORITY AND ALLOCATION OF MATERIALS IN THE POST WAR PERIOD.

(Note by the Secretary)

On June 18th the Economic Defence and Development Committee had under consideration a Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction Paper G.T.4819) outlining a scheme for dealing with the problem of priority in the post-war periods.

The proposals included a suggestion that there should be attached to the existing War Priorities Committee of the War Cabinet, under General Smuts; a Post-War Priority Section.

It was decided that the Minister of Reconstruction should prepare a draft of a public statement on the subject, and that this draft should be considered in the first instance by a drafting Committee composed of Dr. Addison, Mr. Montagu, Sir A. Stanley and Sir A. Mond.

On the 2nd July the Committee again considered the question. They had before them, the observations of General Smuts (Paper G.T. - 4900) and other papers on the proposals submitted by Dr. Addison. The Committee decided to recommend to the: War Cabinet : -

"(a) That the appointment of a Post War Priority Committee on the lines proposed by the Minister of Reconstruction be approved.

"(b) That the Committee: should consist of the Chairman, of the War Priorities Committee (General Smuts)as Chairman, the President of the Board of Trade, The Minister of Reconstruction, the Minister of Labour, the Minister of Munitions and the Shipping Controller.

"(c) That the Minister of Reconstruction should make a public announcement on the subject at an appropriate ... time, in the terms proposed by the Drafting Committee."

It is suggested that the War Cabinet should approve the recommendations made by the Committee.
