The Director General.FOOD PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT.72, Victoria Street,London, S.W. (1)3rd JUly, 1918.Sir,I beg to submit the following Report on the work of the Food Production Department for the week ended 2nd July, 1918:-The Weather.During the first part of last week the weather was cold and dull but improved towards the week end.   Rain is badly needed, and the effects of the drought are beginning to appear throughout the country, but more especially on light land.Hay making is in full iwing, and a great deal of hay has already been carried and stacked.   Corn, potatoes and roots are all looking well, and give promise of an excellent crop,LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION. Agricultural Executive Committees. Essex * The Committee have been authorised to take possession of 400 acres of derelict building land at Thundersley and South Benfleet and to cultivate it themselves.    The land appears, from the results obtained on the adjoining fields, to be promising wheat land.Kent - The Committee have since February last been in possession of a farm at Molash which was in a bad state of cultivation. A manager has been placed in charge of this farm.   The parish of Molash is upon the North Downs and the land is mainly clay overlying chalk.   Many of the farmers in this district have not the necessary means for dealing with arable land and the
Committee have now taken possession of a further area of 110 acj which is suitable for breaking up. This land will &quot;be cultivate under the supervision of the manager of the farm mentioned abovs Gloucestershire - A farm at Syde consisting of 785 acres, of Bh! 415-acres are arable, has been seriously neglected by the owner, occupier who appears to have sufficient capital but to lack practical knowledge. The land is first class Cotswold land and -Committee, having given the owner a suitable time in which to improve his methods of cultivation, have now been authorised to possession of the farm. They have also taken possession of aft of 100 acres at Westbury-on-Severn. The occupier of this holdli was fined In April 1918 for failure to comply with a cultivate order but has effected no improvement since that date, and it! now reported that the farm is in a \^ery bad state, ffforcestershire - The Committee have taken possession of a farm 170 acres at Churchill, 146 acres of which are arable. An or&apos; requiring improved cultivation was served on the occupier In tl autumn of 1917 but no improvement has since been effected, v % * cultivation of this land will be carried on by the Committee. &apos; Possession has also been taken of 41 acres of neglected glebe 1 at Pershore.Prosecutions * A farmer near Hounslow in Middlesex has been fin  50 for failure to comply with an order to plough and plant wit potatoes 8 acres of land. A farmer at Sheepscombe in Gloucest shire has been fined  35 and a farmer in Carmarthenshire  55 for failure to comply with orders to cultivate grassland, Determination of Tenancies.- During the week 2 orders have been madeAeuthorising landlords to determine-tenancies on account of bad farming.in respect of 206 acres, and 2 orders have been made by the Board determining the tenancies of 520 acres.
HORTICULTURAL .Provision of Land for Allotment a *    Reports- received from,, X, 177 districts show that 310,707 applications have been made for plots under the Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (Wo. 2), and that 284,321 plots containing 20,493 acres have been provided.During the week 5 local authorities have agreed to acquire, in addition to the area mentioned above, an area of 31 acres (464 allotments), including.a further 12*ir acres at Leamington. 1 Allotments are being cultivated at Lutterworth in Leicestershire by 332 of the 450 householders, and 30 per cent of the houses have gardens attached which are being properly cultivated.   At Mllnrow (Lancashire) the Local Tribunal has stipulated that Grade 3 men if exempted shall cultivate an allotment.Fruit Section.   230 demonstrations in fruit and vegetable preserva-tion have been given during the week, making a total of 792 such demonstrations during the month of June.     55 Home Canners, together with 522 gross of cans, were sold during the month. Small Live Stock.   The scheme to increase the rabbit supply of the country is arousing great interest.     The Department have received during the week over 4,000 applications for the leaflet which has just been published on this subject.     Over 1,100 letters have also been received asking for information on rabbits. General.   An address was given at Chorley Wood on the 26th June to the Co-operative Fruit and Vegetable Society.   The Society propose to take land up to 200 acres and let it out as allotments and small holdings and to establish a central training section where vce most up-to-date advice and instruction in fruit and vegetable culture would be given and demonstrated.A recent inspection of the Spalding Bulb area shews that on the majority of the small holdings the whole of the bulb area is over cropped by fruit trees or vegetables.   It therefore appears quite clear that the small growers are producing their full quota of essential food stuffs.    With regard to the larger growers, there is evidence that while considerable production of food stuffs Is in progress, the output could be increased by a further reduction of the bulb acreagec
TECHNICAL DIVISION. Inspections of Land. (1) Two portions of derelict land in      &apos; Cambridgeshire, which are being reclaimed by the Executive Committee, have been visited.     Both schemes are well in hand and promise successful results.     One of the farms, extending to 400 acres, was entirely covered by bushes at the time of entry by the Committee in January 1918.     The position now is that 160 acres have been cleared, of which 100 acres have been steam-drained, and the remainder steam-ploughed,(2)     An inspection has been made of a farm of 260 acres in Huntingdonshire, which was taken over by the Executive Commit^ in May 1917.     At the time of entry all the area was in grass, and was used as a sheep run, much of it being covered with busts This year only one-fifth of the land is in grass, the remainder carrying excellent grain crops, except for 7-g acres of a fine plant of mangolds.     The wheat crop, covering 135$ acres, is Va finest in the district. Heating of Hay Stacks.   An enquiry into the conditions-governlij the heating and spontaneous firing of haystacks has been institi Arrangements have been made for 8 investigators in different districts to take daily temperature readings of haystacks for 8 two months from the time of their erection.     These particulars will also give useful information concerning the influence of temperature on the quality of the resultant hay. Composition of Potatoes.   A report on the results of the analyses of potatoes carried out last spring has been submitted. The potatoes were analysed at six centres, and samples were obtained from practically all potato growing districts in the United Kingdom.     The total number of samples analysed was 247, forwarded by from 80 to 100, groy^ers.     The results show that the average proportion of dry matter in last year&apos;s crop was about 22%,       It is proposed&apos; to continue the enquiry this seaso but it is interesting In the meantime to note that one of the 1
best quality potatoes, judging from ike analysts&apos; results last season, is Arran Chief - the variety which is much the bio at commonly grown in this country.labour&apos; divisionRelease of Agricultural.Labour for Military Service.   Although the decision of the War Cabinet on the 26th June that no further calling up notices should be issued to agriculturists&apos;until after the harvest will allow a few thousand men to remain on the land for a few more weeks/ it does not remove the serious danger that the great achievement of agriculturists during the past year may be imperilled at the last moment through shortage of labour ta harvest the record crops.     The Department are, however, taking every possible step to secure sufficient labour for the harvest from every available source.Harvest Labour.   All .the Commands have now agreed to the scheme proposed for the sending cut cf migratory gangs of prisoners of war to. assist with harvest work.     The Prisoner, of War Employment Committee have decided that up to 20% of the prisoners in the working camps of ether Government Departments should, wherever possible, &quot;be made available temporarily for the harvest.A conference has been held with the War Office and  * Ministry of National Service as to the conditions under which convalescent soldiers may be. employed on harvest work, and -it is expected that an Army Council Instruction dealing with this matter will be issued shortly.   . The Dominions have also been asked to allow hospitals under.their control to be included in the arrangement.     The Department have requested the. War Office to grant one month&apos;a .agricultural furlough.to men who are in Command Depots.At the request of the Department the,Ministry of , National Service have issued a circular to all local authorities and chief&apos; constables in the country, asking them   to jnake
available for harvest work as many men as can possibly be spared, The Ministry will make a grant to the authority to the extent of the difference between the wage earned in agricultural&apos;work and tl wage paid by the authority, and will also, in certain cases, make an allowance towards the&apos; cost of. the man&apos;s board and lodging, whl] away from his regular work.&quot;Soldier Labour. The total number of soldiers now out on farms U 59,360.Prisoners of War.   14 additional agricultural camps have been opeduring the week, making the total number of prisoners now employeon farm and drainage work as followsProm 237 agricultural camps..........   13,540Employed from other camps  &apos; ............     1,008Combatant prisoners lodged on farms ..        30414,852Released aliens employed in agriculture   2,08316,955-   6,757 prisoners have been voted to the Department toenable 112 new schemes to be completed, but 146 other schemes forthe employment &apos;of 5,978 prisoners are suspended, as no furtherprisoners are available for farm work at present.War Agricultural Volunteers.   The Ministry of National Service hwagreed that the fact that a man is under call for military servicewill not, up to and including the 6th Instant, prevent&apos;theacceptance of his application for enrolment as a War AgriculturalVolunteer,   flhere.a man!s application has been accepted, a periodof .one calendar month will be allowed for placing him on farm wortThe Department are arranging to bring this scheme prominently beftmen who are qualified for enrolment as Volunteers.7/omen&apos; s Branch. .........1 &quot; &quot;......&quot; &quot;.i.........Beerultlngi   The procession of .women worke-rs which took place on -Saturday was a great success as far as the Land Army was concert The women who took part had been gathered from twenty different counties.   Recruiting meetings, at which the Scots Guards Band played, were, subsequently held in Hyde Park.- S -*
It is hoped that a great impetus has heen given to re-cruiting by the publication of the Prime Minister!s appeal to women to volunteer for work on the land and help in saving the harvest.150 recruits have been enrolled during the week at the Floral Fete in Trafalgar Square, and the headquarters recruiting staff has obtained a further 461 volunteers in London.     The tour in Gloucestershire and Somerset has proved most successful, 185 recruits being obtained in Bristol alone, while a rally at Yeovil yielded 55&quot;recruits.    The Worcester tour is being continued, and one has been arranged for Lancashire and Cheshire.   It is proposed to work London and the suburbs thoroughly this week in order to take advantage of the situation created b  the Prime Minister!s appeal and the procession on Saturday.Training and Employment.   The demand for milkers, and in a less degree, for horsewomen is growing rapidly, there being at present over 100 vacancies for milkers.   Women are being trained as rapidly as they are recruited.   The demand for unskilled women is not so great and the supply is at present larger than the demand,In many of the larger towns gangs of shop girls and clerks have now been organised who go out to farms within a&apos;given radius when required.    The adoption of this scheme is spreading daily. In Birmingham, where similar arrangements were made last year, the gangs have taken over derelict gardens and vacant land.Two hostels have been started near Swanley to supply labour that was urgently needed in the surrounding districts.   It is hoped to extend this system greatly.12,981 women are accounted for in the Land Army as ,follows:-On Farm Work........................... 9,558Lent to Forage Department.............. 198&quot;     &quot;   Timber Department.............. 188In Instruction Centres ................. 2,556Waiting for references to be placed&apos;intraining centres...................... 399Waiting in depots ...................... 131Waiting in their own homes ............. ,  15,1Total ....12,981 Women&apos;s Institutes - 13 new Institutes were started during thepast week.
CULTIVATION DIVISION Costing Eastern.   A system of costing, for application to the horse and tractor schemes is being drawn up for the purpose of Increasing the control of the Department over the financial side of the schemes.   *&quot;A Committee is sitting to consider the details, and the work has so far advanced that it has been possil, to carry out a preliminary test in Surrey, which has shewn the practicability of the Committee!s provisional proposals.

An increased scale of minimum charges for the hire of horses and horse-drawn implements from the Department has been drawn up, which will come into operation on the 1st August. Steam Tackle.   The total area dealt with during the past week is as follows:- ploughed 1,743 acres, cultivated once 12,605 acres, cultivated twice 22,872 acres, harrowed 1,159 acres, mole drained 470 acres, and rolled 252 acres.Preparation for the- ISIS harvest.   493 binders were oonsigned to counties during the week ended 29th June, making a total of 3,843 consigned to date,   11 threshing machines were consigned, making a total of 169 to date.The work of interviewing Committees with a view to steps being taken to ensure an adequate organisation for threshing the 1918 crop is now oomplete;   All Committees now have the work in hand, and it is believed that a great advance in the economical use of threshing tackle will be made this season.!&apos;&quot;&apos;   &apos;&quot; &apos; - SUPPLIES DIVISION. Fertilisers - The issue of-licences, for the delivery&apos;of super-phosphate, sulphate of ammonia, and ground basic Slag, is proceeding satisfactorily. Up to the 1st July,, 442 special licences had been issued for the delivery of 29,416 tons&apos;of sulphate of ammonia during the period June-August and 149 licences had been issued for the delivery of 400,722 tons of basic slag.   No difficulty is found at present in connection with the transport of fertilisers by rail . or water.Potash - Of the 50 tons of potash per week, which it is estimated is. the production of the Government Factory at Oldbury, Ireland will be entitled to 23$ and Scotland to 17$, so that 30 tons per week should be available for growers in England and Wales.   It is proposed to limit distribution to flax and potato growers, and sales will be effected&quot;through the Approved Fertiliser Agents of the Department.
Army. Stable Manure - The suggestion has been made that tha-JEtortic turul Sub-Committees in Surrey and Hampshire should co-operate wt the Army authorities with a view to assisting the removal of Army stable manure transported from Eelmoor dump via the Basingstoke Canal. It is believed that these Committees can collect orders fr allotment holders and small growers near to the existing dumps and possibly arrange for the transport of 3ome quantity of the manure with the resources at their disposal.Attention is now being given to the possibility of improving the distribution of stable manure from Army depots, generally, during..the coming autumn, and the Department are in cemmunication with the Lands Branch of the War Office on the suij ^S^JloverQ &quot; Labour shortage is likely to prevent ricks being -thatched with any rapidity after harvest and an increased supply rick covers will, therefore, be required.   There is no evidence! present of any exceptional demand, but enquiries are being made a view to meeting the need should it arise.Corn Sacksy - A Conference ha3 been held with regard to the provi of corn sacks to meet requirements after the coming harvest, i further million sacks will be needed in addition to the existiif stock, while the Railway Companies and Sack Hiring Companies aw probably not willing to purchase additional supplies owing to current high prices. The Department already possess 500,000 sW and a further 500,000 can possibly be obtained for delivery in months&apos;- time.   The employment of these i3 being arranged,: Wart Disease of Potatoes - A bad case of Wart&quot;Disease has been reported from North London, and the necessary precautions hate taken.   The varieties affected were &quot;Eclipse&quot; and &quot;King Edward Arrangements are being made for a more thorough inspection to carried out in London and some of the home and southern countl there is reason to believe that the disease has not been repof from some districts where it exists.
Potato Spraying- - At tho present time- &quot;hlight&quot; &quot;is. known&apos; -to have appeared in the following areas only:-1,   &apos; Penzahce District, where the disease has been present to a small extent on early varieties at various places slnco May 27th. On June 23rd &quot;blight&quot; was found on a main crop variety on an allotment, in this district, close to ground on whi.cn early varieties were    s growing and which had been affected for some time.   The weather was then dry and generally speaking the potatoes in;;the district were healthy.2.    Barmouth Junction, North Wales.   One case of disease from this centre- has-been identified.   This was reported on the 28th June, and was found. In the variety &quot;Sharps Express&quot;.,-, Many specimens have been sent to the.Departinent from various parts of the country,which were suspected of being affected by &quot;blight&quot; but on examination it was found that they were not affected by this form of disease.&quot;During June.450 demonstrations were&quot; given in various parts of the country on the preparation of spraying mixtures, and the use , of &apos;sprayers*.  During the present season 27 counties have been ^supplied with horse-drawn spraying machines.   Arrangements have been &apos; made for the systematic working of these machines during the next two months, and considerable areas have already been sprayed in a few counties.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.Rt. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, M.P.  -President of the Board.of Agricultureand Fisheries.
