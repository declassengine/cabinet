THIS DOOJMMT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BHIWHIO I,t&apos;J&apos;?3TYT3 gOIWMM. 911111&apos;7 A R   0 A B I II &quot;3 T8.T.-.5Q51.HOSPITAL-SHIPS THREAT OF ECONOMIC REPRISALS,Note by Mr. Chamberlain in occ or dance with &quot;7ar Cabinet 441,, Minute 8&quot;).The .question of threatening Germany with a Commercial Boycottafter the war was considered by.the Economic offensive Committeeunder. Sir Edward Cars on&apos;s Chairmanship, and is referred to inthe paper, G.. 190, circulated by him on January 21st, 1918, inthe following terms1It has been suggested at different times, in quarters&apos; which are entirely opposed to the idea of &quot;war after the war&quot;, that by threatening Germany with a commercial boycott, if she will not accept peace on the Allies&apos; terms,, she might be made to realise that the consequence of prolonging the war would be ruinous to her economic future.   A formula lies been proposed &quot;that for every month the war continues beyond a given.date the boycott shall remain, in force for a yearVno- have &quot;considered, but we ere unable to accept, either the. general principle or the particular formula... Both are at the first glance attractive, but they appear to us to be al-together impracticable, for the reason, that unless.Germany is beaten absolutely to her knees, she would inevitably in-, sift upon brushing this,threat .aside, as a preliminary to anydiscussion of peace terms;&apos;, while the Allies, if thpy were in a moo/d to consider peace at all, would inevitably acquiesce in her demand, npt, only as reasonable, but because .of the,.&quot;&apos; dangerous friction and&quot; exasperation &quot;hioh such a deliberate boycott would keep alive,   le are of oninion that it would bea source of weakness, and not&apos; of strength, in negotiation to have put forward officially a condition which&apos;^e,can never be in a position seriously to maintain.1..The same point is made in a paper written by Sir EdwardCarson when the Committee was set up, Til.0. 0.1,&quot;Measures to make use of the economic to sourcos of the Alii e s for erTec&quot;f?&apos;ve bargaining in &quot;&quot;the peace nominations, andTo counteract tho possible dangers of an unsatisfactory peace.&quot;With regard to this, tho principal portion of our enquiry, the main conclusion at chichi have,, so far, . arrived .is that measures which are avowedly and merely punitive, instead of being in themselves economically de-fensible, and which would have to be enforced by all the Allies for a long period of years, cannot, in fact,, be maintained:, and&apos;,&apos; for that.very reason, will have compare-tively little bargaining value,   A compact to.cut off allcommercial
commercial intercourse with Germany for a period of years proportionate to the further preiongat ion of the war sounds formidable, but would break down almost et once under peace conditions.   Parties interested in renewing trade would urge&apos; that the prolongation had not been altogether Germanyri fault, or might allege some constitutional change in Germany which had not been contemplated when the threat had been made, or suggest that our Allies had not behaved  -- well*to us, or were in fact dealing themselves ^ith Germany, directly or indirectly, in violation of the compact.   As a more debating case, too, any purely punitive scheme would be difficult to sustain in tho atmosphere of a peace Conference,,   And lastly, such a threat, as e mere threat, has no   actual value in itself to the Allies, and therefore less bargaining value..   All this the Germans may be trusted to realise well enough, and that seems to me to discount the value of such a proposal as that put forward by General page Croft,What is&apos;really needed, it seems to me, is such a com-plete organisation among the Allies, for their mutual bene-fit of all the raw materials and resources of the world, by the time the Peace Conference meets, that there is nothing-loft over for the Germans t6 gat; no cranny where they car. in-sinuate themselves, except as the direct result of a bargain for which they must pay their tjuid pro quo. This is a system which is mutually beneficial ana inherently permanent,   if the Germans cannot secure concessions by which they are allowed to participate in it, they are automatically ex-eluded , end the system is absolutely defensible.in argument at any Conference;   there is no question of inflicting de-liberate injury on Germany after tho war, but only of looking after and developing our own interests,, Every concession titeo becomes a positive concession, and not merely an abandonment of a threat which may or may not be carried out, and whose fulfilment may not be of advantage to us.   If, for instance,the whole wool supply of the world is organised under Allied control., and options secured for future supplies over a periodof years, Germany, who must have wool, can only get just so much wool as the Allies are prepared to surrender, end at such price as the- Allies insist upon, in territory or ether-wise.&apos;The essential thing, therefore, is not to agree upon the issue of a threat, but to set to work without delay to organise the resources of the whole Alliance so as to es-tablish a world control of all essential supplies, both present and prospective.   The first step to this end will be for the Government of the British Empire to agree to co-ordinate their own resources, the other,Allied Governments meanwhile doing the same for their own territories. The Allies, or at any rate the British Empire, the United States and France could then build their joint policy on the founda-tion of this preliminary work,1&apos;The opinion expressed as to President Wilson&apos;s views in Paper G.T.5018 circulated by tho Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office on &quot;The United States end Economic Defence&quot;, should also be noted:-
&quot;Ho (President Wilson) will be oprosed to any vindiotiv or purely sentimental notion against Germany; he will he opnosed to any propagandist threats of &quot;boycott; he will want any discussion with the Allies to he conducted on. the basis of a clean slate, unprejudiced by commitments such as those of the Paris Economic Conference;&apos; and he will always be extremely cautious0&quot;If the Cabinet so desires I can bring this question for-mally before the Committee on Economic Defence and Development,but as at present advised I am of opinion,1.     that the economic threat unless preceded or accompanied by definite action on the part of tho Empire and tho Allies will not be effectives2,     that when the Empire and Allies aro prepared for defin-ite action in this field, the weapon is too good a one &apos; to be blunted by use in minor questions of reprisals.(Intd.)
