APPLICATION BY TBS NATIONAL UNION OF COKEMBN AND BIB-PRODUCT WORKERS FOR A MODIFICATION OF THE AWARD OF THE COMMITTEE ON PRODUCTION IN RJBS-PBCT OF PAYMENT FOR WEEK-END WORK.t desire to obtain the decision of tho War Cabinet on a claim made to the Ministry of Munitions by the National Union of Cokemen and Bye-Product Workers that an Award of the Committee on Production dated 14th February 1918t should be modified in respect that the pay-ment of time and a quarter for week-end work prescribed in the Award may be increased to payment of time and a half for work done on Sunday.The Executive Council of the Union has passed a resolution to instruct its members to cease Saturday and Sunday work if this claim is not conceded.     It is estimated that if this instruction was carried out there would be a loss in output amounting to ZQffL    From the point of view of the supply of steel I am unable to afford this Iops.The Ministry of Munitions has held a Beries of conferences with the employers concerned and with the Union,       Concessions in respect of grievances not directly connected with the Committee on Production Award have been offered to the men which are substantial.   A final conference with the parties is to be held on the morning of July 4th in order that the Union may have a final decision from the Ministry on the claim for a modification of the Award in respect of Sunday payments   The Union affirms that unless this particular item of their claim is conceded there will be a stoppage and in the view of the Department a stoppage is probable.The Union has been offered a further hearing by arbitration butrefuses to take that course *The Minister of Labour has been consulted and his position is that he cannot undertake to determine whether the interests of supply should outweigh the abandonment of the principles with regard to Awards of the Committee on Production which have hitherto&apos;formed the foundation of the whole Government policy in regard to wage matters^If the claim of the Union is conceded the same concession will have to be made in the blastfurnace trade and with little doubt in all. other trades in which continuous processes are necessarily worked. I do not feel that where the interests of the Ministry of Munitions as a Supply Department and of the Ministry of Labour as a Department charged with the maintenance of arbitration Awards are in conflict I can take the responsibility of determining what course should be pursued.W. S, C3.7.18,
