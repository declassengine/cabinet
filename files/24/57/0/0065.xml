157Memorandum for the Imperial War Cabinet andWar Cabinet.murmansk and northern russia.LETTER from First Lord of the Admiralty to the Prime Minister reporting the results of his visit to Murmansk and Northern Russia and enclosing three Memoranda and a Map.(A) Memo, by First Lord of Admiralty on the Naval and Military Situation in theNorth of Russia.(B) Memo, on &quot; The Present Position in Northern Russia,&quot; by Captain Collard, R.N.(Naval Staff, Admiralty), and Colonel Steel (General Staff, War Office).(C) Memo, on &quot; The Estimated Maritime Requirements involved by the Naval andMilitary Operations in North Russia,&quot; by Captain Collard, R.N. (Naval Staff, Admiralty), and Colonel Steel (General Staff, War Office).ml June, 1918.My dear Prime Minister,As arranged with you I proceeded to Murmansk (11)* to consult with Rear-Admiral Kemp about the Naval situation in Northern Russia, and Lord Milner asked me to take the opportunity of a talk with General Poole. My Memorandum on the situation deals therefore with both Naval and Military aspects and subject to certain subsequent minor alterations was agreed to by both Commanders before I left Murmansk (.11). The Naval and Military views expressed therein are not mine, but are believed to he the views of the competent authorities on the spot.I was accompanied by Admiral Everett, my Naval Secretary, who had thoroughly discussed the Naval situation with the First Sea Lord before he left, by Captain Collard, R.N., Admiralty, who deals with Naval matters in Northern Russia, and by Colonel Steel of the General Staff, War Office, whom Lord Milner very kindly sent with me, and whose assistance was invaluable in dealing with Military points.We visited Murmansk (11) and Pechenga (1) and discussed the whole situation in all its bearings with Rear-Admiral Kemp and Major-General Poole. We saw the defence arrangements there, proceeding inland for ten miles or so with the object of seeing the typical country of Northern Russia.Three Memoranda are enclosed : (A) A Memorandum by me setting out the views of Admiral Kemp and General Pooleas these became known to me in consultation with them, and finally putting forward my own opinion on the situation.(B) A Memorandum with a detail map setting out the present position so far as it isknown.(C) A Memorandum showing in estimate the Merchant tonnage involved by commit-ments already made by the Supreme War Council.I hope that these documents will be of use to the Cabinet in appreciating the position.In my Memorandum (A) I have endeavoured to convey the extraordinary element of comic opera existing, without realizing which one cannot form a correct opinion of the* Note.-The number in brackets after the name of each place mentioned indicates the number assigned to that place on the accompanying map.

situation in the North of Russia. To illlustrate what I mean I give the following anecdote of what happened on the afternoon of my last day at Murmansk&apos; (11): The Trotsky Government has got a General in command of all the Russian forces in the area. He is an English-speaking Russian Officer of a late crack Cavalry Regiment, who was apparently well known in London society. He is very busy all day, and most of the night, in Murmansk (1.1) holding meetings and attending conferences. He commands no &quot;troops&quot; whatsoever, because his whole force is only a few scattered ragamuffins who may or may not obey his orders. On the afternoon in question, he received a wire signed &quot;Lenin and Trotsky&quot; informing him, as the competent Military authority, and also the local Soviet, that the British were to be ejected immediately from Murmansk (11) ; that anyone dealing with them or helping them in any way was to be treated as a felon; and that we were there only to upset the Revolution and instal the Bourgeoisie in power. This General promptly went on board the British Flagship and gave a copy of the telegram to General Poole and asked him what he should do !Subsequently he telephoned direct to Moscow and told either Trotsky or Lenin personally on the telephone that he did not think their order was a suitable one ; that he and the people had no food if the British went away, and therefore that they did not pro-pose to act. Subsequently the Commissary for the district, who lives in Petrograd (69), telephoned an order that they were immediately to eject the British. When the Commissary was told that the British were stronger than the Russian forces (which in fact do not exist) he said that in those circumstances they were to do nothing until he arrived with a whole Russian Division fully equipped, with which he proposed to hurl the British into the sea. This communication was sent to General Poole, and he was asked to attend the meeting of the local Soviet and its allied Departmental Committees that evening. At this meeting General Poole told them that he would send an. officer down to stop the Russian Division, if necessary by force, on the way to Kandalaksha (21), where he has 1,000 Serbians and 150 French Artillerymen, and if anything further was done by the Russian Government he would bombard Murmansk (11). This appears to have been an entirety satisfactory arrangement so far as the local Soviet was concerned, and they parted the best of friends. At the same time they are negotiating with him for barracks, ponies, etc., which he requires.. One other illustration, though many exist, will suffice. The Petrograd Commissary sent up to Murmansk (11) to requisition some food a Committee of men, whom I saw, all looking like lawyers and men of office pursuits. There were about 20 of them, and the following is the story of their enterprise: They arrived in Murmansk (11) and collected some food, how I do not know, because there are no shops or merchants for the sale of anything, as trading is considered to be profiteering, and all food is distributed by the local committees. The Petrograd party departed on the passenger train with the food, and they got as far as Kandalaksha, when the Murmansk Railway Committee, which was cognisant of what was going on all the time, held a meeting and decided to prevent this export of food; so the train, with the delegation from Petrograd and with the food they had collected, was brought back to Murmansk, and when I saw the delegates, the various committees concerned were considering whether they would let them leave again or not. Meantime, they were living in the train, and the Railway Committee were holding up the situation.There is really no Government; there is no organisation; and there is no authority. Orders are issued by the Central Government at Moscow, but no one obeys them unless they wish, and the various Committees meet and take different views. I am assured that what I saw is typical of what is going on under the Lenin-Trotsky Government in all parts of Russia, and if that is so it must be perfectly clear that no reliance can be placed either upon the Government exercising any authority, or upon their ability to carry out any undertaking which they may come to with the Allies. Also, if what I saw in Northern Russia is really typical of the whole country it simplifies very much the con-sideration of what should be done in the West through Vladivostok. I am told that it is typical, but of that I have no personal knowledge.Yours sincerely,(Signed) E. C. GEDDES.The Right Hon. D. Lloyd George, M.P.
MEMORANDUM A. The Naval and Military Situation in the North of Russia.MEMORANDUM. BY THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY.The object of the general Military activity with which General Poole is charged, is to create a nucleus and rallying point for anti-German Russian forces. Naval co-operation with land operations has no, object in view other than to protect General Poole&apos;s lines of communication and by the display of such Naval force as is available, to assist him and back him up at the points where he lands.Even if Archangel (49) is abandoned, the Naval Staff would not view with equanimity the Harbours of Pechenga (I) and Kola (.15) falling into hostile hands. It is true that these places are not strategically of great value to the enemy as Submarine bases for attack on trade other than that to Archangel (49), but the enemy once established on the Coast could not be dislodged without a very large, costly, and difficult campaign.In order to appreciate the general situation it must be realised that the Murman Coast, and very considerable tracts of country inland, extending probably for hundreds of miles between the Eastern boundary of Norway and Finland and the Western shore of the White Sea, are practically impassable swamp and peat bog with few roads, no means of sustenance for any considerable force, and with the exception of river and lake routes the poorest possible means of communication. The White Sea is open to navigation from June to the end of October with certainty. This year it is very late in opening. Archangel (49) can only be approached by sea during these months.There are two lines of approach to the more central and populous districts of Russia from the Northern Coast, one down the Murman Railway towards Zvanka (71) and Petrograd (69), and the other down the Archangel (49)-Vologda (73) railway.It is down one of these two lines of railway that General Poole with such forces as are at his disposal is to carry the &quot; Fiery Cross.&quot; General Poole has been entrusted by His Majesty&apos;s Government with this mission, and he has studied it and has faith in a reasonable possibility of success in what he himself describes as a &quot; gamble,&quot; and, there-fore, in such matters as have been specifically entrusted to his judgment one cannot, perhaps, usefully, with very limited knowledge, criticise or urge contrary views.General Poole thinks that with a force of approximately 3,000 men, over and above the forces he has to-day, he might be able to proceed down towards Zvanka (71) on the Murman-Petrograd railway and be able to collect an indigenous force of say 10,000 anti-Germans. If he did this he would have the advantage of basing on an ice-free port which would enable evacuation or reinforcement at any time of the year, and the disadvantage of a poor line of railway of very considerable length with innumerable bridges which could be easily cut by light hostile raiding parties working from the Finnish boundary. On the other hand, he thinks that with a force of 5,000 in addition to those he has at present, he could, if he were landed at Archangel (49) under Naval protection, proceed down the Archangel-Vologda (73) line and might draw say 100,000 anti-German Russians to his forces. He has hopes that the men he will obtain can be made into efficient soldiers of an irregular type. He has knowledge and experience not possessed by me, and on account of which he was appointed by H.M. Government; on that ground, therefore, I adopt his view. He is, on the whole, strongly in favour of the Archangel (49) project. His land line of communication would be much shorter than would be the case working along the Murman-Petrograd railway, and would be less liable to hostile raiding parties of the character feared in the case of the Murman line. On. the other hand, instead of working from an ice-free port, he would be working from Archangel (49), which is only open from June to the end of October, and he could neither evacuate nor reinforce his Allied forces.Of the two possibilities, however, he, in the exercise of the discretion allowed him by the Government, has decided that he prefers the bigger gamble, and proposes to advance down the Archangel (49) line to Vologda (73). In addition to the larger number of anti-German Russians which the adoption of this alternative leads him to hope for, on arrival at Vologda (73) he is then in railway communication with and hopes to collect to his army the 20,000 to 25,000 men (i.e. the Czech force east of the Urals) and to obtain Siberian supplies. He admits that this is an off chance, but he holds the view and, I think, rightly-that if you are going to gamble at all, you should stake boldly. He is practically prepared, therefore, to risk his whole force operating from Archangel (*49) (C 1273) A 2
towards Vologda (73) on the chance, be it good or bad, of collecting a powerful Russo-Czech force under his banner.In these circumstances we have to consider two main subsidiary local aspects of the case. Firstly, can we be sufficiently sure of preventing serious and destructive submarine attack upon our sea lines of communication in so far as that attack can be prevented by denying the Murman coast to submarines for bases? Secondly, what difficulties has General Poole to encounter in making Archangel (49) his &quot; taking-off &quot; point, besides the combined Naval and Military one of effecting a landing ?As regards the first of these two questions, I think we are able to form a reasonably accurate impression of the situation.The country around Pechenga (l) is, practically speaking, a continuous swampy waste intersected by a few unmetalled and very poor roads and tracks, with low-lying hills covered with scrubby birch and swamp bushes. We made a trip 10 miles south from Pechenga (l) through what was described to us as typical country, and it appears clear that no attack in great force could possibly be made on Pechenga (1) without an enemy effort entirely out of proportion to the advantage to be gained. When the Intelligence system which is being started is fully developed, the Military Authorities consider that no such attack ought to be possible without information being obtained sufficiently soon in advance.The forces at present at Pechenga (1), if backed up with a ship&apos;s guns and/or a small quantity of artillery, are considered adequate by General Poole to hold the inlet. Although Murmansk (11) has railway communication on the land side, the conditions there do not seem to differ sufficiently from those at Pechenga (l), and then only in degree, to give very different results, and General Poole is of the opinion that approxi-mately the forces now employed, together with such additional local levies and frontier guards as he could enlist, should be sufficient to hold the peninsula. The River and Lake routes are not unimportant and can with perseverance be made useful adjuncts to any hostile advance. The more important are well known to the Intelligence Depart-ment of the War Office, but even with their assistance General Poole does not dissent from the general impression as to communications given in this Memorandum.On the western side of the White Sea between Kandalaksha (21) and Soroka (47), there are many inlets which could be used as resting places for submarines, but the impassable nature of the country behind, and the fact that it is proposed to hold the railway with a mobile force and posts, together with the fact that the country is by no means wholeheartedly pro-German or pro-Finnish, appear, in the opinion of General Poole and the Rear-Admiral Commanding at Murmansk (11), to be sufficient safeguard against any use of the inlets on the western coast of the White Sea as submarine bases, with any reasonable kind of equipment for overhaul and repairs, or any considerable store of fuel or supplies. From Soroka (47) around the southern shores of the White Sea, although there are innumerable inlets, the water is so shallow and the difficulties of navigation so great that this bit of coast, together with the general great difficulty of communications&apos; from the land side, is considered to be of no value to the enemy as submarine bases even although the forces under General Poole do not hold or control the land side.We, therefore, on the first point, arrive at this conclusion, that with approximately the forces employed on that particular defence work to-day there is no reason to fear that the disadvantages of losing the Murmansk peninsula to the enemy need be faced, and the choice of Archangel (49) does not seriously affect General Poole&apos;s sea com-munications.Coming now to the second point, namely &quot; What difficulties has General Poole to encounter in making Archangel (49) his &apos; taking-off&apos; point besides the combined Naval and Military one of effecting a landing ? &quot;-on Wednesday the 26th June General Poole obtained authoritative information from his Military agents in Archangel (49) that the pro-German elements in the town were sufficiently in the ascendant to control the situation, and as a few days before the local Soviet had received instructions to demand the departure of the British armed Icebreaker from the port, it was evident that a landing with a Military and Naval force would not be openly welcomed by the inhabitants even if it were not seriously opposed.The information which General Poole received also stated that the island of Modyugski (50) was defended with 6-inch batteries which were in an efficient state, and that submarine observation mines were being laid and that resistance could be expected. He accordingly postponed the departure for Archangel (49) of his landing force, which consisted of one company of machine-gunners, one company of British infantry, and a composite company of Officers and instructors who had been sent out to him with the object of training any levies which he might enlist.   He and the Rear-Admjral
Commanding at Murmansk (11) decided to go to Archangel (49) together to parley with the authorities, arriving there with no show of force.Although I was not in the district with any Military authority or power, General Poole consulted me and I concurred with him that the course which he and the Rear-Admiral had decided to take was the most opportune in the circumstances, and that it would be a great mistake to make the initial move a hostile one with forces which, in the circumstances he did not consider adequate if serious opposition was met with.Admiral Kemp and General Poole propose, therefore, to go to Archangel (49) as soon as the ice permits, which may he any day, and to proceed there in an inoffensive yacht. Should they find themselves unable to obtain the friendly concurrence of the Archangel (49) authorities to the landing of the Military, it is proposed then that a joint Naval and Military operation of a distinctly hostile character should be undertaken, and the first step would be to seize the island of Modyugski (50) and occupy it; proceeding up the river in sufficient Naval and Military force to dominate the town and land troops, and there-after advancing, as circumstances may permit, down the line to Vologda (73), recruiting such friendly Russians as may be on the road, and generally carry on with the enterprise as briefly outlined at the commencement of this Memorandum.There may be those who fear that such an enterprise as entering Archangel (49) against manned forts with observation mines is too hazardous an undertaking for any Allied forces, Naval or Military, at present in the district, and it is obvious that with any Western European Nation Avhich had the capability of organising resistance the undertaking would be a serious one. It is only because of the comic opera element in the Russian situation in the North to which reference is made later on, that such an attempt is considered at all justifiable by our Naval and Military Commanders on the spot.There is no doubt that the whole enterprise is a gamble ; it may conceivably put us in the position of being committed at a later date (but I can hardly conceive it to be before the spring of 1919) to a larger Military enterprise. I do not feel qualified to express an opinion upon this point, but if it is decided this winter to have an additional 5,000 Allied troops operating on the lines South of Archangel (49), it must, I suggest, be recognised that it is a limited but essential gamble; His Majesty&apos;s Government will be risking, for better or for worse, hostile operations in a country with which we are on a semi-friendly basis and which may resent it. Also that His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Allies are risking a certain amount of prestige and some 6,000 odd men who may be completely annihilated as a force. On the other hand, if it &quot; comes off,&quot; it is possible   and General Poole has reasonable faith in that possibility that the diversion may have very far-reaching effects. If it fails the difficulties of evacuation from Archangel (49) would be enormous and probably it would be impossible.In adopting this view I confess to having been largely influenced by the general total absence of organising power which is apparent among all Russians in the North of Russia, and apparently throughout all Russia, and by the large element of &quot; opera bouffe&quot; in the present methods of government. I will not encumber this Memorandum with illustra-tions, but if my trip to the North of Russia has done nothing else it has taught me to read official telegrams dealing with the Lenin-Trotsky Government not through the spectacles of Whitehall, but through the spectacles with which one has read the history of the rise and fall of the minor South American Republics, and it is because of this character in everything Russian in the Archangel-Murmansk district that I have sufficient faith in the possible effect of a small, compact, well organised and determined effort such as General Poole proposes to make.On the whole, my opinion, after a good deal of thought and consultation, is that the risk, including the Naval side of the landing, is one which I would advise His Majesty &apos;s Government to take, in the belief that it is no longer thought that the Bolshevik Govern-ment is meaning to fight the Germans, and that the enemy will get all he wants out of Russia in any case if we do not intervene.Whether this Northern operation is combined with the intervention of powerful forces from and via Vladivostok or not, if it succeeds it will be a serious check to German domination of Russia, and a great asset to our prestige and post-war com-mercial interests. If it fails, I have set out the risks above, but upon one point I am perfectly clear, that if His Majesty&apos;s Government decides to embark on this venture they should embark upon it whole-heartedly to the extent I have out-lined and which I understand General Poole has asked for without hesitation, which would inevitably paralyze the enterprise and reduce its chances of success to a negligible quantity. The 5,000 additional men and the additional stores which General Poole is asking for are of small moment in comparison to the vast demands of the British armies on the Western Front, and will, I imagine, not be a serious drain on(C 1273) A 2
Gour resources. They are practically covered by the authorisation of the Supreme War Council on the 3rd June, 1918.Similarly, the tonnage necessary to convey them and the additional stores to Archangel (49) is not great having regard to the general volume of ocean-borne traffic for which we are responsible (see Memorandum C herewith) and if General Poole&apos;s daring venture is to be given the best chances, the despatch of the limited number of men and munitions for which he asks should be expedited in every possible way, and any harking back to the inevitable and naturally timorous suggestions of our unofficial diplomatic Representatives in Russia should not be allowed to intervene. If the decision rested with me I should pursue without hesitation a policy on the lines set out above, and failing that I should make up my mind immediately to do nothing this year and merely hang 0)) to the North of Russia with the Military and Naval forces now there or else evacuate entirely, though that latter alternative raises many complicated issues which demand closer consideration.So far as I can learn General Poole considers that there are at present sufficient forces to hold the Murman Peninsula, and unless it is then too late we can start again next year. This course I do not advise. I would disregard the wishes of the Bolshevik Government and act. on the lines General Poole wishes with 5,000 more men but at once.29lh June, 1918.MEMORANDUM B.THE PRESENT POSITION IN NORTHERN RUSSIA.(27th June, 191.8.)(By Captain. Collard, R.N., and Colonel Steel, General Staff, War Office.)1. On the assumption that the Archangel (49) venture is to be undertaken, the retention of the Kola (15) inlet and Pechenga (1) inlet is indispensable, while the retention of the Murman railway as far south as the situation permits is very desirable but not essential.2. Our intelligence is as yet by no means adequate, and it cannot be regarded as satisfactory until much more is known as to the situation in Finland. The additional information recently gained, however, points to the fact that the enemy&apos;s offensive preparations are not so advanced as we anticipated, while his difficulties are, if anything, greater than we supposed.3. According to the information available the present situation is as follows: (a) In the Pechenga (1) Area there is no concentration of any considerable numbers of enemy troops nearer than Rovaniemi (29), where the total number (including possibly a few hundred German troops) may be not greater than about 1,000. (There are, how-ever, newspaper reports that some further German troops have reached Rovaniemi (29)). &apos; Unconfirmed reports place a few hundred Finns about Kyuro (17) on Lake Enare (13).  A few insignificant patrols may be north of Kyuro (17).As regards enemy communications, though a fair road for wheeled traffic (though possibly not for continuous motor traffic) undoubtedly exists from Rovaniemi (29) to Kyuro (17) no such road leads direct from that point to Pechenga (1). Any advance from Kyuro (17) would be limited to an unmetalled road (which is believed to run just eastward of the Russo-Norwegian frontier) or by boat down the chain of rivers and lakes forming that boundary to a point south of Boris-Gleb (5) (situated about thirty miles west of Pechenga (1)), whence a road passable for wheeled traffic in the summer leads to Pechenga (1). There is no confirmation of the previous report of the con-struction of a light railway from Rovaniemi (29) northwards. The difficult nature of the country renders rapid construction for any distance improbable.It is reported that no supplies exist in this part of the country, and. it is certain that there is a great scarcity throughout Finland.It may be assumed, therefore, that any operation undertaken by the enemy during the next few months would be in the nature of a raid limited to a few hundred men with machine guns and possibly some field artillery.
1,950(c) Murman Railway from Kandalaksha Southward.Former reports of enemy activities aiming at cutting the line between Kandalaksha (21) and Soroka (47) were exaggerated.Reconnaissances from Kandalaksha (21) westward towards Allakurti (23) report the road impracticable for Military purposes during the summer. On 15th June the latter place was held by a small White Finn post of 12 men with a couple of machine guns. The road between Kualajarvi (26) and Allakurti (23) is reported to be under repair, but no confirmation of any railway construction (on the road) from Rova-niemi (29) to Allakurti (23) has been received.Reconnaissances from Kem (41) found two small outposts of about 20 men each at Maiderskaya (42) and Yushkozerskaya (46). Boats have been requisitioned and a raid by 300 to 400 men on the railway is considered possible, but no large construction of barracks at Ukhta (39) as previously reported is in progress. The number of White Guards at Ukhta (39) is reported to be 450 to 500 men.Recent reports point to a German-Finnish concentration of about 10,000 at Sordovala (Serdabol) (63) with advanced detachments of 1,500 and 1,000 at Salmis (62) and Suojarvi (60) respectively. The object is reported to be an advance in the near future on the railway and Petrozavodsk (61).The Allied dispositions are as follows :-At Kandalaksha (21) 150 French artillerymen. 1,200 Serbians (good material).At Knyaja Guha (22)-450 Red Finns training under British and French officers and promising well.At Kem (41)-130 British marines (with 8 Lewis guns and two 12-pdr. guns). 20 British sappers (constructing blockhouses). 1 Improvised Armoured train with British, French and Russian personnel.The above troops are sufficient to deal with any raids from the West which are possible in the near future.  In the event, however, of any large movement byThe British forces at present holding Pechenga (1) are 400 blue-jackets and marines with two small naval guns and a few machine guns. Two aeroplanes, or preferably seaplanes, are urgently required for reconnaissance purposes.This force can at present be quickly reinforced from Murmansk (11), but the addition of some field guns or howitzers is needed to make the situation reasonably secure.&apos; The &quot; Cochrane&quot; is in wireless communication with the &quot;Glory&quot; at Mur-mansk(ll).(b) The Kola Met (15).There are two lines of advance open to an enemy advancing upon the Kola Inlet (15) by the railway and by the chain of rivers and lakes stretching south westward to the Finnish border. The former is of course impracticable while Kandalaksha (21) is held. The latter is reported practicable only for small reconnoitring parties and is being watched.  No enemy movements in this area are reported.An attack on men-of-war, store-ships or store depots at Murmansk (11) by enemy aircraft, probably seaplanes based on Lake Enare(13),is considered well within the bounds of possibility, and must be met either by anti-aircraft guns or by fighting aeroplanes.The Allied troops which are available in the Kola Inlet at the present moment, and which could be sent to Pechenga (1), or southwards as required, are as follows: 250 British marines. 100 American marines. 300 Serbians.1,200 British troops just arrived (including 500 of General Poole&apos;s mission for Archangel). 100 locally enlisted Russians (waiting for uniforms).

railway from the South based on Petrozavodsk (6.1) these small forces would gradually be forced to retire on Kandalaksha (2.1), giving up the railway and the Western White Sea ports as they withdrew.Any advance by the enemy could be greatly retarded by the demolition of the numerous bridges on the railway, preparations for which are now under considera-tion. It should be noted, however, that if the&apos;&apos;enemy, simultaneously with such an advance, succeeds in isolating certain portions of the railway by raids from tile West, his progress in reconstructions will be much simplified and hastened.4. It is considered that the early control within the theatre of operations by an Allied Military Governor is essential. Under present conditions the Allies have no control over the railways, telegraphs, wireless, or cable communications, censorship or contre espionage services.  This is considered indispensable to a successful defence.5. To sum up, there appears to be no danger of an immediate enemy advance in force on the Kola (15) or Pechenga (1) Inlets, which are the important places for us to hold. The Murman railway as far south as Kem (41) acts as an outpost to the Kola Inlet and is not yet seriously threatened.We should, however, be prepared for a raid on Pechenga (.1) and for a retirement on Kandalaksha (21).In both cases some field artillery and aeroplanes or preferably seaplanes, in addition to our present forces, are considered essential.MEMORANDUM C.THE ESTIMATED MARITIME REQUIREMENTS INVOLVED BY THE NAVAL AND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN NORTH RUSSIA.(By Captain Collard, R.N., and Colonel Steel, General Staff, War Office.)On the assumption that the number of troops sanctioned by the Supreme War Council on 3rd June, 1918, i.e., 4 to 6 Allied battalions (with, it is presumed, the necessary proportion of other arms and services), will be sent to North Russia, it is possible to consider what the probable requirements will be from the present date until the end of September.These requirements consist of the following: (a) Transport of the reinforcements decided upon and asked for.1 Batt. InfantryDecided upon  From France (for Murman) Asked for From France(for Murman) From America (for Archangel)2 Batteries Field or Moun-tain Artillery 3 Batt. Infantry 3 Companies Engineers 2 Batteries Field Guns Medical and Administrativeunits\ 1 Passenger Steamer2 or 3SteamersDead Weight Tons.Shipping Tons.(b) The maintenance of the fighting forces at Murmansk andArchangel.Murmansk (11).Supplies to last till end of September for 6,500 fighting forces at Murmansk have already been sent in S.S. &quot; Asturian&quot; and it is considered that these supplies will be sufficient as it is unlikely that the local forces enlisted before the end of September will exceed 3,000 men........2,900
These Murmansk forces will consist of :-Dead Weight Shipping Men.     Horses,      Tons.

Additional supplies, however, must be allowed for the 4,500 Allied troops during August and September ..      ..                10,000It is estimated that these Archangel forces until the closing of that port will coiisist of :-Men.

And as supplies for all the winter months, October, November, December, January, February, March and April, must be sent to Archangel in September, the tonnage must be shown here; and it is assumed that the Russian levies will&apos;have expanded by then from 20,000 to 70,000. mil .Dead Weight  Shipping Shipping      Tons.
