Circulated by the Secretary of State for IndiaSECRET.The objections taken by the military Members of the Army Council to the proposed grant of commissions to Indians-are the risk of placing Indians in positions of command over British officers, and the fear that British officers of the right sort will not enter the Indian Army under this change of conditions. The precise nature of the risk that would, arise is not indicated but left to conjecture. Is it that in a population of 300 millions 200 persons cannot be found possessing the qualities necessary for military command ? The experience of the present war refutes this. Or is there an ordinance of nature that cannot be violated with impunity, against placing an Indian, no matter how great his capacity may be, in a position where he commands a British officer? A supposed law of this kind can hardly be distinguished from racial prejudice, and must be rejected by those entrusted with Imperial responsibilities. It finds no recognition in the civil admini-stration of the Indian Government, and if it was ever seriously accepted by military authorities, it was abandoned when the Cabinet agreed to the grant of a limited number of permanent commissions to* Indians.The risk apprehended by the military Members of the Army Council would seem to turn not on a question of principle but of numbers. If a small number of commissions is granted, it is rightly assumed that the standard of admission will be high, and that the instances will be few in which British officers would be under the command of Indian officers. But under the present proposals which are said to entail, risk, there will be no lowering of the standard of admission, and the increase in the number of commissions will, be largely balanced by the great increase in the strength of the New Army over which they will be distributed. The apprehension that there will be any perceptible lowering of the efficiency of the Indian Army or decrease of its popularity as a service from the grant of temporary commissions within the modest limit proposed, seems to me unwarranted by every circumstance of the case.On the importance and urgency of this measure, whether viewed from the immediate necessities of the war as regards India&apos;s effort, or from the i higher standpoint of political justice, I will not dwell. I am content to observe that in my judgment the military cost at which they will be purchased will be small. But the success of the measure and its loyal acceptance by British officers of the Indian Army will largely depend on the support -which it receives from the higher command in this country and in India, and I note with pleasure the assurance given in the note by the military Members of the Army Council that they will use their best endeavours to carry out the policy which Mis Majesty&apos;s Government have determined on.E. S. M.5th July 1918.
