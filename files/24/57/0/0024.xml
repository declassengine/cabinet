T/I?( This dooumcnt is the property of His Britannic ua.jostx&apos;ls Government )v:ar cabinet .Fair Wages Clause - Government ContractsE 0 R E T. l,T. 5023.IToto by tho ilinistor of Reconstruction.I have considered the iiemorandura of Mr. Roberts (G.T. 4005) on lFair Wages Clause - Government Contracts&apos; in which he proposes an amendment of tho Fair Wages Resolution of the House of Commons passed on 10th March, 1909.I am strongly in favour of this Amendment, and would urge its adoption by the War Cabinet.   I feel that Contracting Departments of State indirectly employing labour through the placing of Government orders are placed in a position of peculiar responsibility, as it is generally recognised that the Government should be a model employer. It is but a short step to require that firms vrith Government Oontracts should conform to reasonable standards of employment as a general rule, and not merely r/hen working upon Government orders.   I trust therefore that the War Cabinet will eoncur in Mr. Roberts1 proposal.0.ADDISON, 4,7.18.
