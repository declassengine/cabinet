4)ifoment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   July J 918.CONFIDENTIAL&apos;3Liability to Military Service of Subjects or Citizens of neutral States who were born in the United Kingdom, bnt have made a declaration of alienage, and are no longer British subjects.WHEN this question first arose in consequence of the introduction of compulsory military service, the Cabinet decided that nationals of neutral States, who through the circumstance of their having been born in the United Kingdom possessed British as well as foreign nationality, should, if under the age of 21, be allowed to remain in civil life until they had attained their majority, and had had an opportunity of exercising their right to opt for their foreign nationality by making a declaration of alienage under section 14 (1) of the British -Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914 (Annex A). Persons who at the time of the arrangement had already attained their majority were given a period of grace within which they might make a declaration of alienage that would be accepted as effectively releasing them from their military obligations.2. The Swiss Government, to whose insistent representations the adoption of this arrangement was chiefly due, have lately demanded that Swiss citizens born in the United Kingdom who have been allowed to make declarations of alienage in renunciation, of their British status may, notwithstanding that they failed to do so within the time limit stipulated by His Majesty&apos;s Government, be treated as purely Swiss, and as possessing no liability to British military service. This demand was supported by an appeal to the provisions of article 5 of the Anglo-Swiss Treaty of the 6th September, 1855, under which Swiss citizens are not to be enrolled for British military service (annex B).3. The holding of British-born neutrals for service in His Majesty&apos;s army had previously been justified &quot;by the contention that the individuals concerned were admittedly British subjects at the time when they were deemed to be enlisted under the Military Service Acts, and that their subsequent repudiation of British, status could not operate to release them from the obligations which they had already incurred (vide section 16 of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act (annex C)). Further legal justification for the policy which had been followed is to be found in the decision of the Court of Appeal in the case of Rex v. Commanding Officer 30th Battalion Middlesex Regiment ex parte Freyberger (1917), 2, K.B. 129, to the effect that under the Military Service Act, 1916, a person who had acquired tbe status of a person duly enlisted for the period of the war has no power to divest himself of that statutory status by any voluntary act done during the period of the war.4. It is questionable, however, whether such purely legal considerations would justify His Majesty&apos;s Government in retaining such persons in the army after they have ceased to be British subjects, and in view of the insistence with which the Swiss authorities nave pressed the question, the Secretary of State felt that it was necessary to attach no less importance to the political than- to the strictly legal aspect of the matter.5. The fact that the blockade measures which the British authorities are taking the lead in enforcing against Switzerland have aroused much feeling against Great Britain in that country, was felt to demand that every opportunity should be taken of making concessions to Swiss public opinion where this could be done without material prejudice to national interests, and as the number of individuals involved in the present question is comparatively insignificant, the Secretary of State considered that the balance of advantage lay in meeting the wishes expressed by the Swiss Government.6. Tbe matter has been represented in this manner to the Ministry of National Service and the War Office, the former of which Departments maintained that, political[597] .
considerations notwithstanding, the men concerned should be held to the fulfilment of their technical obligations. It was pointed out to the Ministry that the policy of forcibly retaining such persons in the British army could do little credit to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the eyes of the foreign Governments concerned, and that the numbers involved could hardly be sufficiently great to make the military advantage to be gained by retaining these foreigners decisive against the political disadvantages thereby entailed, while the action of the British authorities would appear to the minor neutral States peculiarly vexatious.7. The Ministry of National Service, however, adhered to their opinion, and were supported therein by the War Office. It was suggested to the latter that the Swiss Government should be informed that while His Majesty&apos;s Government must maintain their view that the men affected were liable to service, arrangements would be made to secure that they should only be- employed in this country, and should not be sent over-seas. Such a settlement of the question would, it was thought, present the following advantages: (a.) It would meet the main argument of the Ministry of National Service as tothe undesirability of leaving these aliens in civil life to give offence bytheir presence to their British neighbours ; (b.) It would protect His Majesty&apos;s Government against the criticism that theywere using members of minor neutral nations as fighting material; (c.) There is reason to suppose that it would satisfy the demands of the SwissGovernment and lead to the matter being finally disposed of in a friendlymanner.8. The suggested compromise has been rejected by the Army Council on the ground that &quot;it is inexpedient from a military point of view, and directly opposed to the policy that all recruits handed over to the military authorities shall be posted or otherwise disposed of as the exigencies of the service may require.&quot; This objection, however, seems to be deprived of much of its force by the circumstance that Russians called up for service with His Majesty&apos;s army are posted to labour units or auxiliary service unless they desire to join combatant units.9. The Secretary of State cannot feel that the drawbacks which he recognises the suggested compromise must entail from a military point of view can be sufficiently important to outweigh the political advantage to be reaped from its adoption, and he therefore submits the matter to the War Cabinet for their decision as to which of the three alternatives should be adopted : (1.) Release of the persons concerned from military service in any shape ; (2.) Retention of them for service in the United Kingdom only ; or (3.) Utilisation of them for general service on the same footing as British subjects.Foreign Office, July 6, 1918.
