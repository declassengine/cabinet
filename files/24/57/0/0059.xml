Smallwood (Secretary).Report.To the Right Hon. Winston S. Churchill, M.P., His Majesty&apos;s Minister of Munitions. Sir,THE Committee appointed by you in March last with the following Terms of Reference: &quot; To consider the report which has been rendered by the Petroleum Research Department on the production of fuel oil from home sources, and to advise to what extent and within what time it should be possible under present conditions to carry out the proposals made in this Report; and to consider the steps which have been taken by the Ministry of Munitions in this connection,&quot;has held thirteen meetings, during which twenty witnesses have been examined and a considerable amount of documentary evidence has been placed before us. The following report is now submitted : The Petroleum Research Departments Report and its Addendum.2. This Report consists of two main sections; (a) dealing with the supplies of cannel coal and kindred substances, and (b) the collection and transport of the raw material and method of retorting.(50r &apos; B
(a.) Supplies of Cannel coal and kindred substances.3. We have taken evidence from the Home Office Divisional Inspectors of Mines, and have obtained a statement from the Department - of the Controller of Coal Mines, showing how much cannel coal is being raised and how it is disposed of, and we have endeavoured to ascertain whether additional supplies of cannel coal could be obtained if and when required.4, In the Petroleum Research Departments Report and its addendum it is stated that a daily production could be attained of about 12,700 tons of cannel coal or kindred material. The evidence given by the Home Office divisional inspectors of mines and information supplied by the Controller of the Coal Mines Department show that the present production of cannel coal and kindred substances is in the neighbourhood of 2,000 tons a day, and that practically the whole of this amount is sold mixed with other classes of coal or is sent to gasworks for gas enriching purposes.5. With regard to that portion of the cannel coal production which is mined with and-despatched from the collieries mixed with ordinary coal, sorting would be necessary in order to render it available for carbonisation, a process entailing time and labour. The mines are at present short of labour, and increased output of cannel coal can only be obtained at the expense of the output of ordinary coal; it is clear, therefore, that, if additional supplies are to be obtained to any considerable extent, a corresponding increase in labour and plant will be necessary, while no appreciable increase in supplies can be expected for many months. Furthermore, since cannel coal is more difficult to get than ordinary coal on account of its hardness, and in most cases the thinness of the seams, the output of cannel coal per man would be less than the output of coal per man.6. With regard to the &quot;Jacks&quot; and &quot; Batts&quot; referred to in the Petroleum Research Departments Report, there are no doubt considerable quantities of these materials lying in mine spoil heaps, but in order to obtain them additional labour would be required for sorting purposes, while in some esses it would also be necessary to make sinkings, to drive cuttings in the spoil heaps, or to remove the overburden by quarrying, and, in addition, risks from spontaneous combustion and landslips of loose material would have to be taken into consideration.7. Labour was certainly available in most of the coal exporting districts during a short period of 1017. but this labour is not available now, and it should be borne in mind that even in 191.7, although a certain amount of mining labour was available during a limited period, the urgent demands of the Army and of the Allies might have been expected to cause the withdrawal, of labour from cannel coal production at any time.        , -- We consider, therefore, that the amount of cannel coal and kindred substances which could be obtained cannot be said to approach the figure mentioned in the Petroleum Research Departments- Report(b.) Collection and Transport of the Raw Material and Metho&quot;d of Retorting.8. It is clear from the Petroleum Research Departments Report generally that it is intended that batteries of low temperature retorts should be erected either in the neighbourhood where cannel is or can be mined, or at centres where it can be easily brought together, and the main conclusion of the Report is stated therein as follows : &quot;It will.be seen from the above that it is already possible to&apos; advise the erection of ninety-eight* batteries of retorts, each capable of dealing with 100 tons per day. Some of these batteries must be adapted for the treatment of coking material, but in most cases the Chiswick form of retort will be found to meet requirements and to give the best results in gallons per ton and quality, of oil produced.&quot;9. From the evidence placed before the Committee it is clear-that this recom-mendation was based entirely on the performance of a single experimental retort which, according to the Report, had for several months &quot; been in continuous operation night and day under the personal supervision of the staff of the Research Department.&quot;10. The&apos;&apos; performance of a single small unit under continual skilled supervision can at best only give a very-imperfect idea of the difficulties which would arise in the regular working of plant of a capacity of many thousands of such units by workmen./* This was increased to 127 in- the addendum to the Report.
Many stages have to be passed in the evolution of a really workable industrial unit before it can be safely left in charge of the ordinary works&apos; foremen and labourers. In the Report there is no evidence that this aspect of the proposed scheme was considered, but it is certain that the necessity for this evolution by stages would have seriously delayed the scheme as an immediately productive measure.1.1. If, however, it could have been assumed that this further experimental stage would be quickly and safely passed through, and a thoroughly proved design for the unit of batteries could be produced, the carrying out of a scheme which involved the erection and equipment of 127 or even 1)8 batteries of new retorts would have been a most serious undertaking even under pre-war conditions : but at the present time and during the past year or more, when labour, skilled and unskilled, and constructional materials of all kinds have been difficult to obtain for the most urgent war needs, the undertaking would have been wellnigh impossible.12. Some idea.of the cost of the scheme maybe gathered from the expenditure which is being incurred in the erection of a small battery of Ohiswick retorts at Nottingham (see paragraph 16). We are informed that orders have been placed for the erection of a battery to carbonise about 50 tons of cannel per day, at an estimated cost of about 25,0001. It would be scarcely fair to calculate the cost of large installations on this basis, but it is evident that if these proposals were carried out an expenditure of several, million pounds sterling would be required.13. The following appear to be serious objections to the course suggested :-(a.) Low temperature carbonisation, except in its application in the Scottish Shale Oil Industry, has not yet be proved industrially, and consequently the erection of large units of retorts to carbonise cannel coal and kindred substances could not be justified until success had been demonstrated oha reasonably large scale.(6.) A considerable period of time must elapse before the necessary retorts could be completed and brought into operation.(c.) A large expenditure of money, labour, and material would be involved in carrying out the scheme, which expenditure would be out of all proportion to the quantity of oil which could be produced.(d.) The requirements of coal at home and abroad, would not permit the continued diversion of labour for the mining and bringing together of cannel coal for this purpose in sufficiently large quantities to ensure adequate supplies for large units of retorts.The steps taken by the Ministry oj Munitions in connection with the Petroleum Research Departments Report.14. The Petroleum Research Departments Report was duly forwarded to.the Munitions Mineral Oil Production Department for action. After careful enquiry into the possibilities not only of the method of carbonisation advocated in the report, but also of other methods which had been suggested, it was decided that no scheme which required the erection and equipment of entirely new carbonising works could be entertained.15. Enquiries having also been made to ascertain whether cannel coal could be satisfactorily carbonised for oil production in any of the retorts already existing ; at gasworks, it was found that this method would be practicable if certain modifications in working were introduced, and steps were accordingly taken in that direction. The utilisation of existing vertical retorts at gasworks involves only a small expenditure of money, labour, and material, and the system can be and is being gradually brought into operation.16. A committee had been appointed in 1917 to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of three types of low temperature retorts ; comparative tests were made, and the results appeared to be in favour of the form of vertical retort used in the Scottish shale oil industry. In view, however, of the strong representations of the Petroleum Research Department in favour of the installation of the Chiswick type of retort for the carbonisation of cannel coal and kindred substances, the Production Department decided to instal a battery of thirty of these retorts at Nottingham, so that practical experience of their working on an industrial scale might be obtained under similar conditions to those prevailing at the Nottingham Gas Works, where cannel coal is being dealt with in the existing vertical, gasworks retorts which have been adapted for the purpose.17. We consider that this was the right course to adopt in the circumstances,.in;&apos;601&apos;; B 2

We consider that this was the right course to adopt in the circumstances,.in;&apos;601&apos;; B 2
order that a true comparison on an industrial scale between the two systems of carbonisation might; be obtained.18. The evidence given before the Committee has proved clearly that existing vertical retorts at gasworks can easily be adapted for the carbonisation of cannel coal for oil production, and oil has in fact been produced by this system. A sample of this oil has been tested at the Naval Fuel Depot at Haslar, and it lias been found to be suitable for the utilisation as fuel for the Navy it&apos; mixed in certain proportions with petroleum taken from stock. Certain physical treatment is necessary, but refining by distillation or chemical treatment is not required.19. A sample of the oil produced by the Chiswick form of retort has also been subjected to tests at Haslar. which show that the setting point of mixtures made with this oil is considerably higher than the Admiralty standard.20. It is clear that the vertical retorts already existing at the gasworks in the country have sufficient capacity for carbonising all the cannel coal and kindred substances which can be produced without grave interference with the output and transport of the present coal supplies, and it is obvious that the small alterations necessary for the adaptation of vertical retorts already existing at many gasworks involve an expenditure of time, labour, and material, of quite a different order to that which would be incurred in the construction of entirely new batteries of retorts.21. In view of the above facts and of the results which have been obtained with adapted vertical retorts at gasworks, we consider that the Ministry of Munitions were justified in declining to carry out the recommendations contained in the Petroleum Research Departments Report.22. Bearing in mind, however, the limited quantity of oil which can at best be produced from British cannel coal, we hesitate to recommend, for the following reasons, that the utilisation of existing vertical retorts at gasworks should be extended on any large scale until its general economic conditions have proved satisfactory : (a.) The output of canneloid materials would have to be considerably increased, and this could only be done under existing conditions at the expense of coal.(6.) The coal transport arrangements rendered necessary by the exigencies of the war would be upset if large quantities of cannel coal had to be transported to the proposed carbonising centres at gasworks, which might be outside the coal transport areas concerned.(c.) There would probably be some decrease in the production of town gas, which could be ill afforded under present conditions.(cl.) There would certainly be a reduction in the output of coke available for industrial and domestic purposes, as cannel coal and canneloid substances are not satisfactory cooking materials, and in most cases their ash contents is very high.i23. It is clear that a largely increased quantity of oil cannot be obtained by the carbonisation of home produced materials during the war, without interfering with other not less important industries. In any event the national requirements of oil are so large that even&apos; if supplies of cannel coal were multiplied many times over the amount of oil that could be obtained from this source could only represent a small fraction of the total amount required. It is necessary, therefore, to determine the relative importance of the industries concerned, and we feel that, generally speaking, it is not advisable at present to take further special steps in this direction for oil production beyond those already taken or in preparation.General.24. While the large question of policy as to obtaining or maintaining adequate supplies of fuel oil within the country does not fall within our* terms of reference, we have given passing attention to the matter, and apart from the carbonisation of canneloid substances, other possible sources of supply appear to be: (a.) Boring lor oil in Great Britain.(b.) Further development of the Scottish shale oil industry. The possibility of this development was laid before the Royal Commission on Fuel and Engines for the Navy in .1912-13.(c.) The utilisation of dehydrated tar by the employment of suitable solvents. .   (d.) A great extension of the cabonisation of raw coal as a preliminary to its use for industrial and domestic purposes.    As the greater part of the coal
consumed in Great Britain is used in the raw state there is obviously wide scope in this direction for developments on a really important scale. For every 20 million tons of coal carbonised from 1 to lj- million tons of fuel-oil might be obtained. The Fuel Research Board ol! the Department of Scientific; and Industrial Research, is now developing a comprehensive enquiry into the technical and economic possibilities of such a revolution in the preparation and. use of fuel for industrial and domestic purposes.(e.) The utilisation of the extensive deposits of Kimmeridge shale which are known to exist in a belt which crosses England from S.W. to N. E. Hitherto no success has attended the numerous efforts which have been made to utilise these shales on any of the well-known-lines. It ought not to be lost sight of, however, that these deposits would become an important national asset if their use could be fitted into any wide scheme of carbonisation which had for its objects the provision of fuel-oil for the Naval and Air Services and of fuel-gas for industrial purposes.(/.) The economic possibilities of the utilisation of the extensive peat deposits in the United Kingdom are receiving careful consideration by the Fuel Research Board, and it is understood that a report by a committee appointed by them in connection with this question is at present under consideration.(g.) Increased storage of imported oil in this country. This course would involve the provision of very large storage capacity and plant, and could only be carried out extensively under peace-time conditions.These questions will, however, no doubt be fully dealt with by the Fuel Research Board of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and by the committee recently set up under the chairmanship of Viscount Harcourt by the Petroleum Executive.25. Summary of Conclusions.(I.) That the scheme for the carbonisation of cannel coal and kindred substances recommended in the Petroleum Research Departments Report was not a practicable one, and that the Ministry of Munitions were justified in declining to embark on it. ((2.) That the alternative policy of developing the production of fuel oil from cannel coal and kindred substances in existing vertical retorts at gasworks should be developed within the limits indicated in this Report.(3.) That the decision of the Ministry of Munitions to erect a battery of the Chiswick form of retorts was the right course to adopt in the circum-stances.26.
