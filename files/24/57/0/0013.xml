&amp;6n[This Docmeiit Is the Propeii;y^of His Britannic Majesty^ &amp;ownment,&apos;J,   Printed for the War Cabinet.   July 1918.i) &apos; &quot; &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;SECRET. G.T.-5013.THE LABOUR SITUATION. 12.Report, from the Ministry of Labour for the week ending the 3rd July, 1918.Summary.Part I: General Remarks.The growth of unrest in the Labour world and the method of its treatment is discussed. The opinion of organised labour on the war policy of the Government, as indicated by the proceedings of the Labour Party Conference, is described.Part II: Press Comments.The opinion of the Labour press on military affairs ; on peace problems ; on a League of Nations; on Labour and the Government; on Whitley Committees; and on sundry other matters is described.Part III: District Reports.Unrest is reviving in most districts, particularly in London and South-Eastern, in Yorkshire and East Midlands, in the North-Western district and in Scotland.Part IV: Disputes.(a.) Involving a Stoppage-of Work. The miners in the Castleford district have resumed work.   No widespread strike is now continuing.(b.) Not Involving a Stoppage, of Work. -There are a number of serious disputes, including specially those among the iron moulders on the Forth and the woollen operatives at Bradford.I.-General Remarks.I    The Growth of Unrest.In last week&apos;s report it was suggested that the possibility of a future comb-out depended on a prior extension of dilution, and that opposition tb dilution was partly due to realisation of this fact by the unions. The week which has just passed has displayed tendencies which support the opinion so expressed. &apos; In certain quarters there is a tendency, apparently deliberate, to delay output in order to prevent the possibility of a further comb out of operauves. Of this tendency the following instances may be I    cited.It will probably be found necessary to prosecute the Ironfounders for a general refusal to work overtime, except on payment of extravagant rates. The dockyard workmen at Rosyth, for instance, are claiming time and a half instead of time and a third for all overtime, double pay for Sunday work instead of time and a half, and generally the i same rates as are received by contractors men. These demands are refused, with the result that the men have ceased to work overtime or on Sundays.   This demand forIextra pay for overtime commenced with the moulders in the foundry. It is reported that members of the A.S.E. held a meeting at Plymouth in sympathy with the Rosyth workers. Prosecution will also probably prove necessary in the case of the Glasgow District Council of Ironmoulders. This body fined six of its members bl. each for infringement of [1100-36] B\
the rules of the Society with regard to overtime and piece-work, Tljese men came to an understanding with the Hydraulic Foundry Company, Whiteinch, by which by working ordinary time the number of bombs turned out exceeded the normal standard very considerably. The incidental result was a large increase in the men&apos;s wages, and the action of the Society is very strongly resented by the men on the ground that output is being retarded and increased wages prevented.In another direction the Bricklayers&apos; Union has refused to allow its members to receive an output bonus. The effect of that, bonus in one case was an increased output from 400 bricks per day per man to 1,100 bricks per day per man, and the refusal to allow payment of output bonus is a deliberate effort, to prevent the higher standard of work.In the London district the woodworkers on aircraft threatened a stoppage of work unless the system of payment by results which has been in force in many shops for months past is abolished by Saturday next. The rank and file are content with the system, but the Executive are forcing the pace. The A.S.E. is leading an agitation for a reduction of hours of work, the agitation being most pronounced in the Midlands, where Lord Leverhulme\s recent Batley speech has given an impetus to the demand for a five-dav Aveek and nine-hour dav.The effect of the policy, of which the above instances are quoted, is that production is everywhere suffering, and that though there is no very definite reduction, the curve of output shows signs of instability.Another direction in which symptoms of unrest are discernible is the progressive weakening of authority of arbitration awards. While labour was available this tendency to disregard awards was not of such grave importance as it now possesses, when no labour is available from which occasional vacancies can be made good. The attitude towards awards is instanced, possibly in an extreme manner, ia a report from Liverpool. The Mersey Tieconstraction Committee, which is a shop stewards&apos; organisation, decided that strong action should be taken to force the demands which are now being considered for an increase in wages, seeing that the officials of the trade unions will not move in the matter. They decided to call meetings in every shop in the district to discuss the situation prior to the issue of the award. When the award is issued a mass meeting of the whole district will be called to see whether it meets with approval or not. The impossibility of enforcing an award in the face of organised opposition of the whole industry is obvious.A further indication of the spirit of unrest is found in the impatience of trade union discipline by the rank and file, which shows itself in their refusal to be bound by arrangements made by their executives. This is a feature which has been mentioned on frequent occasions, and it is.now being accepted in many instances by the executives themselves. Recent instances are those of the Scottish bakers, who refused to accept their executive^ proposal for a 66s. wage per week, and carried an amendment demanding 80s. In conference with, the Ministry of Labour the executive-agreed on behalf of the men that the matter be taken to arbitration with a view ultimately to a national settlement, and promised to recommend that course, with the result that this proposal was rejected by the men. In the recent Castleford strike objection to inter-ferencc by the executive was so pronounced that the men refused to allow members of that body to speak at their meetings or to interfere in the local negotiations. Their attitude was doubtless justified in their opinion by the result of those negotiations, which proved a complete victory for the men.The above recital of symptoms of unrest indicates the strength of the Labour position at the present time. There seems no visible limit to the demands which will be made in the future, nor does there at present appear any effective means of resisting those demands, unless the Government is prepared to face serious industrial trouble. The control of Labour now falls entirely on the Government, which has for this purpose practically replaced the employers, whose resistance to wage demands is weakened by the certainty of reimbursement, and in a crisis the position is bound to be conditioned by the demands of the Supply Departments, which cannot afford to see any reduction in the programme of out-turn. The prospects, of the future are so serious that a definite stand against outrageous demands is required,, whatever the effects of that stand may prove to be. Things appear to have reached a point where a widespread strike may very well prove in the end to be a smaller evil than continued reluctant concessions to inordinate demands by organised Labour, concessions which settle nothing because they only stimulate new demands. Moreover, it is very doubtful whether a really serious strike is likely. A good many of the demands now put forward are simply u try-ons.&quot;   If firmly refused they will in most cases collapse, as happened to the
threatened resistance to the Committee on Productions last national award; at worst, there might be a few outbursts, which would probably not last more than a few days, and might prevent far more serious stoppages in the future. The present position contains elements of grave danger to war-production, quite apart from any question of finance, and, unless some check is put upon the wages-scramble, its effects will become almost irremediable.The Labour Party Conference.The Conference called by the Labour Party to consider the question of a social programme was held on the 26th to 28th June. The outstanding features of the Conference were the resolution to denounce the political truce and the sensational appearance of M. Keren sky.The explanation offered by Mr. Henderson to the effect that the resolution on the subject of the truce was not intended to imply the withdrawal of the Labour Ministers from the Government undoubtedly affected the importance of the resolution. In view of that explanation and of the restriction of its effects to by-elections which may occur in the interim before the next General Election, the resolution may, indeed, be considered negligible as an indication of the attitude of Labour towards the policy of the coalition Government.As to the attitude of organised Labour towards the war no definite resolution was before the Conference. It was, however, perfectly clear from the reception accorded to parts of the speech by M. Vandervelde, and from the enthusiasm of the general welcome of M. Kerensky, that the Pacifist Party in the Conference was overwhelmingly outnumbered by those whose opinion is in support of the British policy which demands the military defeat of Germany. The question of M. Kerensky&apos;s address led to very violent opposition by the pro-Bolshevist element headed by Miss Sylvia Pankhurst. This opposition, however, was clearly exceedingly distasteful to the great mass of the delegates, and when a vote was taken whether M. Kerensky should be heard by the Conference or not, only five hands were raised in opposition to the motion. M. Kerensky&apos;s speech was a condemnation of the Bolshevist policy with its inevitable reliance on German support, a*nd an appeal to the Allied nations to come to the assistance of the true Russia in its struggle with Bolshevism and with Germany. The reception of the oration was exceedingly cordial.It may be concluded with some confidence from the proceedings of the Conference that the pacifist agitation, which has been so intense and so constant among organised Labour, has affected the leading representatives of Labour in a very slight degree.II. Press Comments.Military Affairs.The &quot;New Statesman&quot; eulogises the Italian armies, and approves of the decision not to push forward beyond the Piave. It thinks that a fresh Austrian attack, though not improbable, is hardy likely to be dangerous. While the &quot; Clarion &quot; is also pleased at the defeat of the Austrians, it regards internal dissensions and a bad economic condition in Germany and Austria, as more significant factors.Kuhlmanris Speech.The &quot; New Statesman &quot; considers Kuhlmann really more dangerous, because more insidious, than the pan-German. Germany&apos;s Eastern ambitions are the main stumbling-block, and Hindenburg and Ludendorff share, to a larger extent than might be supposed, von Kiihlmanns desire to obtain as early a peace as possible on terms that leave the East untouched. The writer concludes by inferring from the &quot; explosion of wrath against even such a strictly limited departure from pan-Germanism,&quot; how far the German mind still is from any approximation to the Allied point of view.Peace Problems.Mr. Snowden&apos;s paper, the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; quotes Liberal newspapers as admitting that the peace debate in the House of Commons was useful. Though those papers deprecated it as inopportune, the French press do not take such a view, and during the last fortnight have contained more frequent ontspoken declarations in favour of peace than at any time since the war began,   The &quot;Call&quot; estimates the
effectiveness of Mr. Snowden&apos;s speech by the anger it caused in Mr. Balfbur in place of his usual languid insolence. To this paper the chief lesson of the debate is the deadly apathy of the workers, which allows men like Mr. Balfour to play shuttlecock with their lives and happiness. On the same subject the &quot; Clarion&quot; makes a strong attack on the pacifists. Mr. Balfour blamed Mr. Suowden&apos;s speech as discouraging the Allies and their friends and encouraging the Central Powers, and attributed this policy to monstrous folly and ignorance. The &quot; Clarion &quot; assumes that an exaggerated politeness is a profitable and, indeed, essential quality in a Secretary for Foreign Affairs.League of Nations.Mr. Henderson in the &quot; Herald&quot; summarises Viscount Grey&apos;s pamphlet and approves of it. The theory is no longer academic, and Ministers and Cabinets will now be judged by their attitude towards it. The Allied Governments should publicly and plainly declare their acceptance of the idea. The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; while describing Lord Grey&apos;s note as admirable, says that both in Great Britain and in the United States, as well as in Germany, men are to be found who are deeply imbued with the evil spirit of militarism. Lord Grey is wrong in believing that a league of nations must have armaments to enforce peace. The only real guarantee of peace is disarmament. Mr. Snowden goes on to diagnose the cause of international antagonism as economic monopoly. To prevent war there must be complete equality of economic opportunity for all nations.Russia.:The &quot;New Statesman&quot; wonders, without deciding, how far Keren sky is right in. presaging the fall of the Bolsheviks. Unless they collapse intervention by the Allies would be dangerous. The &quot; Labour Leader&quot; refers to a recent press campaign in favour of a Japanese advance in Siberia. It still believes that approval by the Allies would be a criminal blunder, and it blames the impotence or indifference of the House of Commons to a vital question like this.Zionism.A correspondent of the &quot; New Statesman &quot; reviews in a long article the progress of the Zionist idea, arguing strongly in favour of a British protectorate of Palestine. In the &quot; Call&quot; appears a statement by the Jewish Social Democratic organisation protesting against Zionism because it cannot solve the working-class Jewish question. The formation of a Jewish State in-Palestine, where Jews form an insignificant part.of the population, would be entirely contrary to democratic principles. Any scheme of colonisation must be perfectly general.Ireland.The debate in the House of Lords has revived attacks on the treatment of the Irish question by.the Government. Mr. Brailsford in the &quot;Herald&quot; laments the long tale of conquest and coercion. The failure of the Government to grant Home Rule and to impose conscription is due to the unity of the Irish people, and a contrast is drawn between this and the failure of Labour to assert, its wishes. In the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; and the &quot; Call&quot; contempt for the Government is less measured. The former paper says that no Government has ever shown greater incapacity than the present Government during the lust three months in dealing with the Irish question. The &quot;Call&quot; speaks of the deluge of contempt and derision which has fallen on the Government for its inglorious handling of this problem, and adds that presumably British- conscripts will now be released.[Socialist Policy.&quot; Justice&quot; continues its articles on Socialism and municipal government, and Socialism and the Church. On the former topic it publishes a scheme for local Civic Leagues. In regard to the Church the wide influence of clerics in social matters is described. An editorial article justifies this attack on the Church, by the clerical incursion into the Labour Party and its political organisations.
War Volunteer Scheme.Both the &quot;Herald&quot; and the &quot;Call&quot; (George Feet) stigmatise the official War Volunteer Scheme as one for conscripting Labour. The former notes that while the skilled worker becomes a war munitions volunteer, the unskilled man is to become a war work volunteer, and it suggests that the National Union of General Workers may have to defend its own liberties. The &quot; Call &quot; demands that workers&apos; committees should look into the matter.Labour Conference.Discussion of the Labour Conference is to some extent preoccupied with the question of M. Troelstra. The &quot; New Statesman&quot; and M. Branting (interviewed by M. Huysmans in the &quot;Herald&quot;) defend him against the accusation of pro-Germanism.Labour and the Government.A leading article in the &quot; Herald,&quot; after discussing the action of the Government in regard to war and peace negotiations, suggests that the only party with sufficient honesty, idealism, and brains to undertake Government is the Labour Party. The claim that Labour Ministers have made less sacrifice of their principles than Ministers of other parties is scouted. Men like Mr. Barnes and Mr. Clynes should realise that their true position is not that of subordinates in a Tory Government. They should be leaders in one which would really represent Labour ideals in war and peace. The manifesto of the Labour Ministers is also attacked in the &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; which describes it as exceptionally weak, and asserts that the only real defence contained in it is an admission that when the Labour members entered the Government they tied their own hands.Whitley Committees.Disapproval of the Whitley Report by the more advanced papers and unions continues. The &quot;Herald&quot; quotes with approval a- resolution passed by the annual meeting of the National Union of Railwaymen directed against the spirit of the Whitley Report. In another note it praises the Joint Memorandum issued by the Minister of Reconstruction and the Minister of Labour as clearing up a number of difficulties, but calls on the Government either to apply the principles of the Whitley Councils to its own employees or to refrain from pressing these on the private employers. In the &quot; Call&quot; George Peet invites attention to the importance of the strikes at the Gorse and Lilac mill in the Oldham district, as showing the increased importance of workers&apos; committees and. shop stewards and their advance in recognition.The &quot; A.S.E. Journal&quot; condemns the Whitley Report because it is supported by the employers. Their position, on the other hand, is defended in the &quot;Shipbuilding and Shipping Record,&quot; which finds cordiality difficult with workers seeking to control industry on the lines of guild socialism.. It suggests the bargain of shorter hours for increase in output.Food.Practically no comments are made. The &quot; Call&quot; criticises a reply by the Ministry of Food to one of its articles on profiteering in meat. An agitation is set on foot by the &quot;Co-operative News &quot; for the rationing of jam.III. District Reports.London and South-Eastern.Unrest is reviving in this area, more particularly in the aeroplane industry, where serious trouble is threatened upon the question of non-recognition of shop stewards.The women employees in the various aircraft works are demanding a higher rate of pay, while charges of bad time-keeping and the question of piece rates are arousing much discussion among the men.George Stubbs has again addressed a meeting at Woolwich; his speech followed the usual lines of criticism of the Arsenal authorities.[1100-36] &apos;     C
tSouth-Western.The situation in this district is somewhat disturbed, and it is reported from Bristol that continual agitation exists among&apos; the woodworkers owing to disputes upon questions of demarcation. So serious indeed has ibis difficulty become that it is stated to be having a very deleterious effect upon output, owing to the inclination to strike upon the smallest provocation. A strike in A. V. Roe&apos;s aeroplane factory at Humble (Hants) has occurred over a wages dispute, and another in a factory at Cowes over the dismissal of a girl.West Midlands.An improvement is manifest in this area. The Commissioners have settled the two . disputes at Austin&apos;s, and notices to workmen have been cancelled. It is feared, how-ever, that trouble may arise at Messrs. White and Poppe&apos;s Works, Coventry, as regards the payment of a bonus, while throughout the district it is rumoured that the E.T.U. are intending to start an agitation for a 25 per cent, increase for all electrical workers, and a 48-hpur week for men in power stations.Yorkshire and East Midlands.The situation in this area is considerably disturbed.In Bradford much unrest has been manifest among the textile wprkers, in con-sequence of the decision of the Board of Control to increase the number of hours worked. This decision, which has been accepted in other parts of the district, is very unpopular among all workers in Bradford, particularly the women, and it is feared that more serious trouble may develop. The difficulty&quot; is at the same time aggravated by pacifist, socialist, and I.L.R activities. The movement to obtain higher wages and a 48-hour week is still in progress among the Leeds engineers.North-Western.This district is still restless, though few strikes of importance are now in progress. . Much discontent at present prevails in the Mersey district, where it is alleged that the Committee on Production, in dealing with wages applications, does not give its decisions upon an impartial consideration of the evidence. The shop stewards have passe, I a resolution of protest, and threaten trouble in the future unless the present application for a 20s. advance receives favourable consideration.The Barrow shop stewards have had under consideration the question of Leaving Certificates and the War Munitions Volunteers Scheme, and all shop stewards b,ave been instructed to investigate the feeling of the men as to further action.A movement is on foot to form a federation of the trades engaged in the building industry in and around Liverpool, throughout South-West Lancashire and Cheshire.Northern.The situation in this district is rather more disturbed than has been usual for some weeks, and various small strikes are reported. There is, however, no unrest of a very serious nature at present in existence.South Wales.Scattered trouble has arisen in mines in this district, but this is not of a serious nature.The Cardiff municipal employees are still on strike, and the local branch of the N.U.R. have passed a resolution threatening serious consequences unless the City Council yield.Scotland.Considerable unrest is still prevalent in this district.The riveters in the Glasgow area are very unsettled over an award granted by the Committee on Production, while the bakers&apos; dispute at Dundee has now developed into a strike, which threatens to spread to Glasgow unless a settlement is effected.A crowded meeting of the Union of Democratic Control took place at Glasgow on the 23rd, at which Mr. Ramsav Macdonald, Mr. Morel, and others spoke. The speakers adopted a moderate tone, and the meeting passed off quietly.
IV. Disputes.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work.Although the general situation gives more cause for anxiety, lew strikes of importance are reported.The Shipyard Labour Department reports nine new stoppages, involving in all 811 workers.These include a demarcation dispute between brass-finishers and brass-moulders at the Canard Steamship Company&apos;s works, a dispute of timekeepers with the Mersey Dock Board upon a wages question, and a claim of 10 per cent.1 oh piece rates by 200 platers and riveters at the North of Ireland Shipbuilding Company.The Ministry of Munitions reports 7,280 workers involved in strikes for the week ending the 26th June.About 1,400 men are on strike at the Patent Shaft and Axletree Company, Wednesbury, in consequence of the calling up of 1898 and 18CJ7 men. It is complained that their work is of national importance, but that men who were sent back from the Air Force are now being recruited for the infantry. An additional grievance is that some Grade 1 dilutees are still left in the works.Alleged victimisation led to a strike of about 70!) workers at the Alliance Aeroplane Company&apos;s Works, Hammersmith. The management dismissed the chairman of a shop committee meeting on a charge of insubordination.The dispute at the Austin Motor Works has now been settled upon the restoration of the status quo, and the strict recognition of the Shop Stewards Agreement of December 1917, while arbitration upon the bonus question has been referred to the Committee on Production.The War Office Contracts Department has only one new stoppage to report. This was a short strike at Northampton in the boot and shoe trade as a, protest against the calling up of men in the trade.The Coal Controller reports twenty-six new stoppages.The men in the Castleford district, where about 12,000 had been out, resumed work on the 1st July, the matters in dispute being left to the Joint Committee to decide.The stoppage at the Garswood Hall Coiliery upon the question of post-war miners still continues. Several stoppages have taken place in South Staffordshire, with a view to expediting the general demand for an increase in wages.(b.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work.The Shipyard Labour Department reports thirty-nine new and eighty-one old cases of dispute.   Of these thirty-six have now been settled.A dispute has arisen at Messrs. Beardmore and Co., Glasgow, over the employ-ment of ex-soldiers as drillers. To this the men object, and claim that, as some men in the trade are unemployed, ex-soldiers cannot be allowed t.) work as drillers unless fully qualified.   Drastic action is threatened.The plumbers at Messrs. Harland and Wolffs, Govan, complain that the firm is giving undue preference to coppersmiths in the allocation of work. The men refuse to submit to arbitration and have requested the Shipyard Labour Department to intervene.The Ministry of Munitions reports on the embargo placed upon overtime by the executive of the Ironmoulders&apos; Society in Scotland.In the case of the British Hydraulic Foundry Company, Glasgow, certain of the men have themselves suggested prosecution for restriction of output. The men employed at the Eosytb Dockyard have refused to work overtime. A movement in favour of increased overtime rates had previously been set in progress by the. Engineering Federation, and it is now suggested that overtime should be resumed and the dispute submitted to the Committee on Production.The War Office Contracts Department has two new controversial cases to report.A dispute has arisen at Bradford in the wool textile trade, owing to the refusal of certain Bradford operatives to work on Saturday. A reduction of working hours to forty-eight per week is desired throughout the industry, with the continuance of the rate of wages paid for a fifty-five and a half hour week. Until a settlement of this claim is made the Bradford operatives have been advised by the Union officials to work on Saturday, but some fear of independent action on their part is expressed.
The Coal Controller reports only one new controversial case.A strike is threatened throughout Cumberland by the Enginemen&apos;s Union on account of the alleged non-observance of a recent award of the Conciliation Board regarding the. hours of loco-drivers.The demand of the Miners&apos; Federation for an additional Is. bd. (and 9d) war wage has been granted, to take effect from the 30th June.The Committee on Production has heard forty cases in London during the past week.The most, important of these was the periodical hearing by special agreement of alterations in wages in the federations of engineering and shipbuilding trades, and also in the engineering heating trade.The Chief Industrial Commissioner reports 162 differences. A total of twenty-seven cases in reference to the 12^ per cent, bonus has been referred to the Committee on Production.G. H. ROBERTS.
