W 89Confidential.Political Intelligence Department,Ji*ne 29, 1918.Foreign Office. Sweden/005.MEMORANDUMCONDITIONS m SWEDEN.onA reliable Swedish correspondent, strongly pro-Entente and a keen and competent observer, who has ju3t returned to Sweden aftereconomic and political of which the following is the substanee:Sweden is now in a state of semi-starvation.   Fats&apos; and sugar are almost entirely lacking and everyone haa become so thin that the impression created is that some formidable disease must have taken the population in its grip.    The result of the very sevare food conditions is general apathy.    People are so hungry and so weak that their interests are eonfitied to thte ordinary cares of every-day life.    There does not seem to be sufficient brain-power left for any keen interest in events abroad.   The Swedes in fact are more pacifist than ever, and owing to the bad conditions feelings are much less intense than they have been.    The pro* Germans are no longer as pro-German as they wetfe.    The pro-Entente people, never so strong in their support of the Entente as their adversaries of the Germans, are as lake-warm as ever.    Very striking is the still unbroken faith of the average Swede in Germany&apos;s absolute military supremacy.    The last German offensive has made a great impression and many of the Liberals and Socialists seem almost white with terror.    There seems to be a lack of moral equilibrium.   Everybody wants peace.   How the war ends is only a secondary consideration.   People just live from day to day longing for the time when peace will come.    Yet it is quite clear that the Germans have latterly lost ground.    The new trend in Swedish politico seems to be towards a stronger economic and industrialan absence of six months, has sent a pen pieture of conditions
2.nationalism.   The danger of the-ec-onomic,. domination     &quot;Qerm&amp;ny,. of the Scandinavian markets is beginning to be realised, and business men, even some of those who are still pro-German in&apos;their sympathies, are realising the urgent necessity of an economic approach to England and the Allies.   The political situation is likely from the Entente point of view to improve.     If the food and raw materials promised fcy America and the Allies materialise, the general apathy is likely to turn towards sympathy for the Powers who are providing them.   There is, however, a distinct fear as to whether the foodstuffs and other commodities will ever reach Sweden.    Nobody seems to trust the German promises of free passage across the seas.Very noticeable is the hatred of the Germans amongst the working classes.With regard to food prices the rate of increase is about 250 per cent.    A suit of clothes costs   &apos; 300 to 350 Kranor, a meal in a restaurant about 10 Kr., a bottle of champagne 50 Kr., tobacco, about 40 to 50 Kr. a kilo, and then it is often mixed with hops.   An apartment can only be got under special conditions. As an example, the writer mentions that he was offered an apartment of six rooms and a kitchen for 70,000 Kr., that is to say, 50,000 Kr. cash, the rest to be paid interest at 5i per cent plus a rental of 3,000 Kr.     This means 30,000 Kr8 cash down and yearly payments of 5,200 Kr.29.6,18. .....-----.........
