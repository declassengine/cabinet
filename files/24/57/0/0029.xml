05July 3rd, 1918.Political Intelligence Department, Foreign Office, Italy /0031,1 E l\ ORAHMMonBARON SONIMNOA semi-official Stefan! note recently denied %i\ the Oiornale dj^ltalia the- character commonly attributed to it in the Italian press of inspired ergan of the Minister for Foreign Affairs,     The denial was accepted furn grano by the Press in Italy and there can be little doubt that the attitude adopted by the Oiornale on the question of ItalyVs war-aims and in regard to Austrian problems generally oorresponds in the   main with that of Baron Sonnino.He delayed as long as possible Italy &apos;s declaration of war on Germany.He has resisted throughout the pressure of the Allied Governments and of his colleagues for drastic dealing with enemy agents and Germans in Italy.He has been eo-ually obstinate in opposing measures for the utilisationin the Entente cgKise of Osecho-Slovak and Jugo-31av prisoners.He has clung tenaciously to the terms of the Inter-Allied Agreementof April 1915, by which Italian aspirations are seoured at the expenseof 1Jugo-Slavia&apos; as well as of Austria-While expressing general readiness to make concessions and sacrificesfor the sake of friendly relations with the Slavs of the Balkans, he hasrefused to descend to particulars or to allow these questions to bediscussed in any concrete manner.He is said to have been responsible for the watering down of theleclarations agreed to by the Inter-allied&apos; Council at Versailles onJune 3rd.The position taken up by the Oiornale   with regard to Austria maybe summarised somewhat as follows:-
(1)   Scepticism as regards the Slav movement of revolt against&apos; Austria-Hungary^(S)   Dislike of the *Jugo-Slavia&apos; project as a menace to Italian influence in the Balkans arid as likely to be ultar-democratic inpoliti-cal tendency, &quot; .(3)   Belief or profession of belief in the possibility of an anti-German Austria, and in(4) a federalist solution of the nationalities problem - embracing all the Slav po ulations now subject to Austria-Hungary except such as fall within the territories claimed by Italy;    leaving outside(5)   an indelendent but not greatly enlarged Serbia with commercial vut-lets in the Adriatic but no navy or naval bases.(6)   Italy to be supreme in the Adriatic,It is probable that on all these points the Oiornale fairly expresses the opinions of.Sonnino.It seems clear that he shares the Irredentist and nationalist preju-dice against the Slavs, not only as anti-Italian but as democratic in political complexion:   He is probably impressed by old-fashioned military and naval viewsithose e.g. of Admiral Thaorn di Revel) as to the strategic necessity for Italy of a hold on the Dalmatian mainland.     Probably also he is sceptical about any complete victory of the Entente and has no full sympathy with ethical objections to German Macht-politik - believing that the world will be much the same after the war as it was before - a game of Balance of Power and &apos;Devil take the hindmost&apos;..Therefore, not believing in and having no taste for an Italy-Jugo-Slavia combination, he is anxious net to antagonise Austria-Hungary com-pletely by encouraging union for revolutionary ourposes of all the sub-ject races but would keep the door open for compromise with a slightly curtailed Austria-Hungary - the curtailment to benefit Italy alono, ex-oept so far as it may be possible to secure in an anti-German Austria
better conditions for Bohemia. Croatia etc.He reluctantly assented to the general policy expressed by the Congress if Rome, but, as 1&apos;Unita saySi still &apos;conceives Italian national aspifca-;ions from an exclusively Italian point of view&apos;,     The result is that he Italian Government, as far as its action is controlled by the ConBulta, s in effect encouraging the subject-rases of lustria-Hungary to rise in revolt and incur the risk of &quot;bloody reprisals merely for the sake of the Immediate assistance such a movement promises to Italian arms - an entire-jy selfish and cynical policy and one which is quite unreconcilable with lither the ideals or the interests of the Entente a3 a whole,Sonnino&apos;s position in the Government nas been over and over again jssailed from various sides and over and over again the complications and (angers of the internal situation have saved him.&apos;   The war-party, the (Interventionists&apos;, only command a majority so long as its two wings hang together.     The Tascio&apos;or &quot;League off National Defence&apos; on whibh the jovernment has mainly to count for support against Socialists, Clerical ad Giolittian neutralists, pro-Austrians and peace-at-any-price groups, raws its strength from the men of the Centre and Right, the great indus-rialists - much under the influence of Nationalist and. Irredentist Jiauvinism.     The gascio supports Sonnino so long as he stands farm for lie letter Of Italy&apos;s claim3 as set out in the 1915 Agreement.     7hen jir a moment he was supposed to be ready to consent to a revision, they ireatened to throw him over.     His colleagues, though they are gravely jibarrassed by his views on Austrian policy and would probably be glad to I free of him, feel that any breach in the Government facade would let the deluge of Defeatism and therefore have to sunoort him and keep up orofession of solidarity.    .The Radicals, Republicans and Reform ncialists - the Left wing of the Interventionist bloc - are not suf-ciently strong or well-organised to maintain a Government in power in-pendent ly of their Allies of the Right and Centre.
The Italian Government cannot co-operate with usfwholeheartedly In-the settlement on just and liberal lines of the Austrian and Balkan questions so long as it is dependent on the Chauvinist section of the coalition which brought about the Italian Intervention.     This- whole-hearted co-operation can only come from a Government Supported by the Left tying of the Intervention.     v/e should therefore neglect no means zt strengthening this Left wing, and 1ve can best do this by making a clear pronouncement in favour of their programme both in regard to the subject-races of Austria and to Italian national aspirations.
