0 3This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, and should be        returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.]Decypher.    H,M.&apos;s  Consul  (Geneva),                                 12th  March,  1933.          D.   2,15  p.m., 12th  March, 1933.          R,   2,45  p.m., 12th  March, 1933.No. 178.     Following for  the Lord President of the council from Secretary of State.     Embargo  of  arms  to the Par East.     1.  ; Enquiries here have made it entirely plain that no international agreement embracing both members and non-members  of  the League is realisable at any ratefor some time to come.   Legislation would be requiredin more than  one arms producing country before any suchembargo could be put  into effect.   Prime Minister and Iconsider that in these regrettable circumstancesannouncement  given  on February 27th should be withdrawn.It was adopted provisionally and pending an opportunityfor international consultation and has always been recognised to be ineffective, standing alone.  UnitedKingdom will  continue to  co-operate in any international discussion,,     2.   Confidential.     Belgian representative told me yesterday  that Belgium could not stop exports without legislation,  see also Brussels telegrams Nos. 1 and 2of February 24th and  March 1st.    United states representative here has  confirmed the view that his country cannot act  without legislation and none appears                                               to . -..
to be in iasiiediate prospect.   Manifestly it is more&apos;difficult to get effective international agreement whenthe temptation of securing orders at our expensa continuesstrong.    I hope the statement in Parll/ament can be made without  throwing the blame specifically on the taiitedStates especially as unwillingness to co-operate promptlyextends  to others also.
