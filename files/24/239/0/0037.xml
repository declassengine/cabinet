Circular 1331Housing Authorities    (England and  Wales)MINISTRY OF HEALTH,       Whitehall, S.W.I.                April,  1933.SIR.HOUSING  ACT,   1930:  PART  I.    1. I ain directed by the Minister of Health to state that HisMajesty &apos;s Government have given very  careful consideration to amatter that deeply  and  urgently  concerns social  welfare, the clearance of slums and the improvement of bad housing conditions.    2. In the view of His Majesty&apos;s  Government the present rate at which the slums are being dealt with  is too slow and they look for a concerted effort between the central government and the localauthorities immediately concerned to ensure a  speedier end  to the evil, and an end within a limited time.  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare further of opinion that present conditions are favourable to thesuccess of a vigorous campaign of slum clearance.  I am, therefore,to request that your Council will take this letter into their immediate consideration and  will regard  the matter  as one  which requiresurgent attention.    3. The slum is, in the main, a relic  of  the time when generallaw and byelaws  did not prevent  the  establishment of housing conditions which are intolerable according to present standards.It is a strictly limited problem ;  and it is measurable both as to thecost and the time required for its solution.  Experience has shownthat reliance for a solution cannot be  placed upon indirect influencessuch as a  &quot; filtering up &quot; into new accommodation.    4. Programme and time table. In the opinion of the Minister,to make sure that the evil shall be remedied, it is necessary to con-concentrate upon direct action, to fix a limited  time for the work, andto prepare a time-table for its progress and completion within thetime limited.  The time-table must, of  course, be based  upon acomplete appreciation of the whole  extent  of the problem in thearea concerned.    5. For  over twenty years,  the Local Authority have had theduty of inspecting and recording the condition of all working classproperty in their area.  The records kept in accordance with thisf&quot;:,T--&apos;---
duty* should now provide a complete picture of the conditions ofthe Borough or District.   The Local Authority should, therefore,be able to take immediate action.   6. I am, accordingly, to request that they will now proceed :        (a) to prepare and adopt a programme, the components of     which should  be           (1) a list of the areas in which clearance is necessary,       with information of the number of houses to be demolished       in each, and of the number of their inhabitants  ;          (2) a list of the areas in wluch improvement by way of       reconditioning or  otherwise is necessary, with information       as in (1) above ;          (3) a time-table for the initiation, progress and completion       of action to secure clearance or improvement,  as the  case       may be, of  all these areas ; and          (4) a  time-table  of rehousing  co-ordinated  with  the       displacements contemplated by the time-table of clearance       operations :         (b) to make an immediate beginning with the  programme     by the declaration forthwith as  clearance  or improvement     areas of such areas as can be immediately dealt with, and by     making the necessary orders.     If in any case the records available to the Local Authority are  insufficient for the purpose of framing such a programme, I am to  request that the necessary survey and inspections may be put in  hand forthwith.     7. The Minister will be glad to receive, not later in any event  than September 30th next, a copy of  the programme adopted by  the Local Authority.  He hopes that many programmes may be  available substantially sooner. The programmes should, so far as  practicable, be drawn on the basis of clearing all areas that require  clearance  not later than 1938.     8. The Minister desires me to emphasise the point that while  slum clearance work on a large scale  may  be necessary only in a  limited number of large towns, there are few towns or even villages  in which, although the  areas concerned  may not extend to  more  than half a  dozen houses, there is not  an  urgent need for  some  action under the Act of 1930.      9.  London. The problem of the slum in the  County oi London  stands by itself.  The  area  and the population  of the County are       * In particular,  records under tho Housing Consolidated Regulations,   1925, as amended by the Housing Consolidated Amendment Regulations,   1932.
3largo in comparison with  those in any .other urban aggregation ;and the effort required by the Mctropohtan Borough Councils, and the London County Council will be greater, and the time needed to remedy the.present deficiencies will be longer, in proportion.   The Metropolitan  Borough Councils  should confer with  and submit their proposals to tho London County Council, whose dutyit will be to co-ordinate such proposals and transmit them,tothfeMinister as part of a general programme winch they will themselvesprepare for the  County of London.    10.  Rate of Subsidy. The present rate of Exchequer subsidy *under the Housing Act, 1930, has been maintained at its  present level as an  inducement to local authorities to  undertake withoutdelay the greatest possible amount of slum clearance and improve-ment work.   11. Re-housing. As an accelerated rate of progress in clearancework is imperative, I am to state that the Minister will in future beprepared  as a general  rule to entertain applications, forwarded tohim  at  the  same  time  as the  Council&apos;s resolution  declaring aclearance area, for loan sanctions in  respect  of a reasonable pro-portion of  the  re-housing likely  to  be  required.  The Ministerhopes  that, by  tins means, it will be possible  to shorten oon-sidcrably the aggregate time taken over the whole process of dealingwith bad housing areas.   12. Advice and Assistance. The provisions of the Act of 1930have been fully explained in  Circular 1138.  Should the LocalAuthoritj&apos; find any difficulty, technically or otherwise, in action under the Act or in the preparation of the programmes proposed,the  Minister will place the services of his  staff (which is beingaugmented to meet the need for wider and more rapid action) attheir disposal.   13. Financial Considerations. Conditions are now exceptionallyfavourable for the work.  With low budding costs and cheap money,houses built with the subsidy payable under the Housing Act, 1930,can be let at rents well within the capacity of the poorest of theworking classes.   That subsidy is equivalent to  15 per annum foreach non-parlour house with three bedrooms, since such  a house is regarded as providing accommodation  for five persons.  Theaverage  inclusive rents payable  would therefore  -compare veryfavourably with the average rent paid by tenants  of slum houses.Higher unit grants than  that described  above are available inrespect of houses built in  agricultural parishes or flats in buildings of more than three storeys on expensive sites.   *  2  5s. 0d. per person ,displaced annually plus an annual contribution from local rates of  3 15s. Od. per house both payable for forty years.
    14.  In so far as the families displaced from the demolished slumsare in possession of sufficient means to find other accommodation.the new houses at these low rents will bo available&quot; for other poorpersons who are living in seriously unsatisfactory  conditions andwho cannot afford ordinary rents.
