S DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY Ot? HIS BRITANNIC MAJFSTY1S GOVERHMgKT) .(33)                       CABINET.       Trailing in the Moray Firth and Firth of Clyde.   Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.            I apree with the proposal put forward by the Secretary  of  State for Foreign Affairs in his Memorandum CP.58(33) that the  invitation of the Government of The Netherlands to His Majesty!s  Government to take part in a Conference to discuss amendments to  the North Sea Fisheries Convention should be answered as soon as  possible, and I can see no reason for further delay.            Acceptance of the invitation would not limit us to the  Agenda proposed oy the Netherlands Government.  V/e should remain  at  liberty to surest subsequently the discussion of other subjects  germane to the Convention.  One subject,the inclusion of which I  hope to discuss with the Secretary of State for Scotland,is the  addition to the convention of provisions to prevent the destruction  of  under-sized fish, for which I think the time may now be ripe.  Cur acceptance might, therefore, be accompanied by an intimation  that we may wish to propose other subjects for discussion, in  addition to those put forward by the Netherlands Government.           In the meantime, I think it is desirable that the  question of the Moray Firth should, an proposed in Mr. Ormsby-Gore&apos; s  memorandum of the 26th July, (C .P .261(32)), be discussed by a  Cabinet Committee, including the Ministers of the Departments  concerned, on whose report the Cabinet can decide whether this  question also should be raised at the Conference.
