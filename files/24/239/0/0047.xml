*This document Is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.     Joint Memorandum &quot;iy the Home Secretary,the Foreign Secretory end the Secretary of State              for Dominion Affairs .     In a memorandum  (C*P.394(32)) which the Home Secretarysubmitted to the Cabinet on the 15th November, 1932, he askedfor authority for the preparation of - a Bill which would enablethis country to ratify a Nationality Convention which was concluded at the Hague in 1930.  This Convention included threeArticles which rre concerned with the nationality of marriedwomen, and a brief summary of these Articles is appended as afootnote.  It was proponed to take the opportunity of including in the Bill a number of miscellaneous amendments in ournftionality law, all of which have been agreed inter-deprrtmentallybetween the Foreign Office, the Home Office and the dominions office; some of them have also been agreed with the Dominions.     At its meeting on the 23rd November last the cabinet decided (Cabinet Conclusions 62(32) Conclusion 10) that, in viewof the possibility of a Private member&apos;s Bill being introduced during the Session, no immediate action should be taken but thatthe Home Secretary should watch the development of opinion inParliament on this subject before proceeding to draft theproposed Bill,     Article 8 removes the difficulty of statelessness by providing that the loss of a woman.&apos;s nationality shall be conditional upon her acquiring the nationality of her husband.     Article 9 applies the same principle to the case where a wifeloses her nationality during marriage by virtue of a change in her husband&apos;s nftionality, and provides that in such a case the wife isnot to lose her nationality unless she acquires her husband&apos;s newnationslity under the law of the country where he is naturalised.     Article 10 provides further that even where the wife would obtain her husband&apos;s nationality on his naturalisation she shall not do so except with her own consent.E C R E T .CAB I N E T .,P.97(33) .NATIONALITY OF MARRIED WOMEN.
     The Cabinet&apos;s decision was due to some extent to the reluctance then felt to enter into consultation with the Dominionaregarding the miscellaneous amendments to which reference has beenmade, since it was feared that some of the Dominions might haveseized the opportunity to try to reopen major questions of Imperialrelationships.     While this may be an objection to the proposed miscellaneousamendments, it is not in our view a justification for postponinglegislation to carry out the Hague Convention.     The British Government is unequivocally pledged to give effeotto this Convention.     Not only did the Government in their published reply to theLeague of Nations (A.15, 1932 .V) express views in favour of theConvention and announce their intention of advising His majesty o ratify as soon as the neoessary legislation had been passed, butalso at the meeting of the League last Autumn the British delegate,speaking with the full authority of the Government, stated that&quot;it was the urgent desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government to see theConvention generally adopted.   In their view it represented thegreatest common measure of international agreement and should beaccepted as the best solution at the present time in the interestsof all concerned1&apos; .     Moreover it was put on record at the Imperial Conference 1930that it was assumed that all members of the Commonwealth who were represented at the Hague Conference would introduce legislation togive effeot to the Hague Convention.   Canada has already passed the necessary legislation to give effect to this Convention in anticipation that similar action will be taken by other membersof the British Commonwealth.  Until such aotion is taken there isa breech in the unity of the law relating ta British nationality,and  it is very desirable that His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom, which has always insisted on the importance of theprinciple of unity, should take action to preserve that principle.
     Whether therefore the question Is considered, by reference toour international bbligrtion or by reference to our imperial relations, it ia equally important to give effect to the HcgueConvention.     The vvomen&apos;s organisptions are opposed to the ratification ofthe Hague Convention because they think it would confirm theexisting principle of our law that as a general rule a wom?n&apos;snationality follows that of her husband..  It is true that legislation to give effect to the Hague Convention would not meetthe women&apos;s claims but that is not p sufficient reason for refusing to ratify the Convention.    The adoption of these provisions would ameliorate the condition of a certain number ofv/omen who are at present liable to become stateless, and suchamelioration ought not to be rejected merely because it does not involve acceptance of the general principle for which the women1sorganisations stand.     The answer to those who contend that any legislation on thissubject ought not to be limited to the provisions of the hague convention, but ought to remove all the disabilities of marriedwomen in matters of nationality is as follows:-     Although successive Governments have accepted the principle           of equality&apos;  between the sexes in this matter, they have alwaysmade it clear that legislation to give effect to this principlecould not be undertaken unless and until the principle is acceptedby all members of the British Commonwealth.  The law relating tcBritish nationality is not a purely municipal or domestic lawoperative only within the confines of the United Kingdom.f   At the 1931 Assembly of the League of Nations the delegate ofthe United Kingdom Government endorsed this policy in thefollowing terms:-             r&apos;The British Government  considers  that it is right       that  all disabilities of married women  in matters of       nationality should be removed, and that in so far as       nationality Is concerned,  a married woman should be in the       same  position as a man - married or unmarried - or any       single woman&quot;.
  British nationality is f common attribute of all His Majesty&apos;*  subjects, and the existing law gives statutory expression to the  sentiment of unity which binds together His Majesty&apos;s subjects  dwelling in all prrts of the Commonwealth.  If therefore there is  one subject which no Government in the United Kingdom is entitled  to consider from a purely insulfr standpoint, it is this subject  of the law relating to British nationality.  Hitherto it has not  been possible to reach agreement with the Dominions in favour of  such amendments of the law as rre desired by the women&apos;s  organisations, and until such rgreement has been obtained there  can, in our view, be no question &apos;of legislation to give effect to  the women&apos;s demands.       We have, in consultation, given much thought to this question,  and we are entirely in agreement that the best course in all the  circumstances is to introduce a Bill giving effect to the Articles  of the Hague Convention dealing with the nationality of married  women.  The other miscellaneous amendments which it was originally  proposed to include in the Bill are not less important, but some  months would necessarily be  spent in obtaining the consent of the  Dominions, and legislation incorporating these amendments could  not be introduced before next Session.  Now that the present  Session is so far  advanced,  we think it is desirable, in order to  avoid delay and the possibility of failing to get legislation  carried before the end of this Session, to limit legislation on  this occasion to the provisions required for the purpose of  enabling  the Government to  ratify the Hague Convention, on the  understanding that every effort will be made to deal with the other  miscellaneous amendments at  the earliest possible moment, and that  the Dominion- Governments will be approached at once with a view  to  ascertaining their position  in regard to these amendments.                                     J. G.                                     J. S.                                     J.H.T&apos;,7th  April,  1935.
