Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1933.SECRET.                                                Copy No.     30CP.  58 (33).CABINET.TRAWLING  IN  THE MORAY FIRTH AND FIRTH OF  CLYDE.           Memorandum  by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    ON  the  29th  June  I  circulated  to  my  colleagues  a  memorandum(OP.  237 (32)), drawing  attention to the fact that it had not yet been found possible to send a reply to the Netherlands Ministers note of the 22nd May.1931,  inviting His Majesty&apos;s Government to attend a conference at The Hagueto revise the International Convention regulating the police of the North sea fisheries of the 6th May, 1882, owing to the failure to reach agreement as towhether a proposal should be made to the Netherlands Government to include in the agenda of the conference the question of foreign vessels trawling in thesefirths.  I annexed to my memorandum a draft note to the Netherlands Minister,and explained that, while the Secretary  of State for Scotland concurred in its terms subject to minor alterations, the President of the Board of Trade and theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the First Lord of the Admiralty were unable to concur.    On the  11th July the  President of the Board  of  Trade  circulated  amemorandum (CP. 250 (32)), in  which he expressed the opinion that the draft note to the Netherlands Minister was open to grave objection, not only on fisheryand naval grounds, but also on general shipping grounds, and he advanced reasonsfor holding this opinion, which were that if we claimed jurisdiction, as in effectwe should, over these wide areas of open  sea, we  should  have  abandoned  our traditional  policy of confining  jurisdiction  over  coastal waters within  the narrowest limits, and we should  be seriously embarrassed in  resisting claims of all kinds to interfere with shipping outside the 3-mile limit.    On the 28th  July the First Commissioner  of Works, acting  for Sir J.Gilmour, then Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, circulated a  memorandum(CP.  261 (32)) in which he suggested that the question should be  referred to aCabinet Committee with  the addition to it of the President of the Board ofTrade, and that the Committee should meet as soon as possible after the return of Ministers from Ottawa.  In the meantime,  the First Commissioner of Workssaw no reason why the invitation of the  Netherlands Government should not beaccepted, as the Cabinet had agreed, on the 11th February, that British participa-tion  in the conference should not  be made  conditional on the  acceptance inprinciple of the policy of the Secretary of State for Scotland.  The President ofthe Board of Trade  asked, subsequently,  that  this question should  be postponedin Cabinet until he could attend.    In September Sir Archibald  Sinclair, then Secretary of State  for  Scotland.circulated a memorandum  (CP. 269 (32) ) in which he expressed agreement in thedraft note subject to alterations of detail, and  he submitted that, as the question was fully settled  by the Cabinet on the 11th February, and as no  new point of substance had arisen, the Cabinefs previous  approval of  the policy should be confirmed and a  note sent to the Netherlands Government with the suggestedmodifications.6782  [8318J
    I feel that it is very necessary that this long outstanding question should besettled,  and that a reply should  be  sent  to the invitation of the netherlands government as soon as possible, as,  apart from the lack of courtesy shown tothat Government,  it must  necessarily become increasingly  difficult to give asatisfactory explanation to Parliament of the delay.                                                                      J. S.    March 6,  1933.
