Memorandum &quot;by the Home  Secretary.          This Bill purports to give  effect  to  certain recommendations of the Royal Commission  on Licensing  in  regardto the establishment of hotels and  restaurants  as  special  classesof licensed premises.          The Bill is promoted by the Hotels and RestaurantsAssociation, and will confer privileges  in the  matter of the  saleof intoxicating liquor on the leading hotels and restaurants  inEngland and Wales, but public houses  in  the  ordinary  sense  of-the- term vrill probably not  derive any benefit from its provisions.          The main provisions of the Bill are :-      (l) The establishment  of a privileged class of licensed         premises, the qualifications to be  - structural         suitability for and bona fide use as an hotel or  a         restaurant, and evidence that the percentage of         intoxicants sold is not more than a certain  percentage         of the whole turnover (50^5 for  hotels,  and 60%  for         restaurants).      (2) The grant, to premises which qualify,  of  a special     -  -- licence, which will car^r  with  it certain privileges,         viz:            &quot;(i) the right to supply intoxicants with  meals                ^(a)- on -wee^&quot; days--af irer btar-olose  of &quot;-permitted                     h.ours  at night, viz: until 12 midnight in                     the Metropolis,  and until  11  p.m. elsewhere,                     and                  (b) on any day up  to 3  p.m., in districts  where                     the afternoon  &quot;break&quot; commences  before that                     hour:            (ii) permission  for bona fide residents to &quot;treatrt                bona fide guests with intoxicants  at  any hour
                up to midnight:          (iii)  freedom, to some degree,  from the control of                licensing justices over structural alterations.          The promoters seem to have endeavoured., generallyspeaking, to follow the Royal Commission&apos;s recommendations,hut have departed from then: in some important respects both, inthe way of addition and omission.   (The statement in the preamble that &quot;This Bill gives effect to these recommendations,without any additions&quot; is inaccura.te .)    Some of thevariations are not unreasonable, but others are open to objection.   The most notable of the latter, perhaps, is the omission of the Commission^ proposal that certain of the privileges conferred by the Bill should be capable of application, by order of the Justices,  to premises which,though genuine hotels or restaurants, are unable to qua.lifyfor the special licence on their percentage of liquor trade.Without any such provision the Bill, so far at a,ny rate ashotels are concerned, is merely a measure for the benefit ofthe big establishments.   Another example is contained in clause 4, which apparently makes it incumbent on the Exciseto allow rebate of licence duty automatically in the case of premises holding the special hotel or restaurant licence.The Board of Customs and Excise, with the approval of theChancellor of the Exchequer, have notified strong objectionto this Cla,use .          So far as the question of controversy is concerned,it is known that the Bill has its enemies.   It will be criticised by the retail trader, since the ordinary publichouse will not stand to benefit;  by the brewing interestssince the majority of the hotels and restaurants are notbrewer owned;  and by the extreme temperance movement whichis bound to be hostile to any measure which enlarges facilitiesfor the sale of drink.   A hostile motion has been put down
by Dr. Salter, v/ho is a member of the United Kingdom Alliance.It is not clear how far any of the interests mentioned above will carry their opposition, or how far they may obtainreinforcement from the Labour Party, who may join with the&quot;Trade&quot; in criticising the Bill as class legislation.          On the other hand the Bill will find favour with many.It is in harmony with such movements as the &quot;Come to Britain&quot;,the &quot;Travel&quot; movement, and the like, and is reasonably assured of a good reception from the popular press.   Moderate opinion,too, amongst those actively interested in licensing reform is incomplete sympathy with the Commission&apos;s recommendations in thematter.          While therefore it cannot be said that the Bill willnot arouse controversy, I should anticipate that it would be supported by the general feeling of the House of Commons.          Although almost all liquor licensing questions arevery controversial and although the structure of licensing lawis so  complex that a. modification of any part of it presentsgreat difficulty, I think that the subject matter of this Billis one which is capable of being dealt with separately, andthat the proposed changes can be made to fit into the structure of existing licensing law - though I am advised that, for thatpurpose, the drafting of the Bill will have to be carefullyscrutinised, and will need substantial amendment.          Generally, I consider that the Bill, suitablymodified, may effect a useful purpose .   I suggest that itshould be given a free vote of the House, and that the attitudeof the Government spokesman should be to express approval ofthe principle of the Bill, while making it clear that theacceptance of the Bill by the Government would be conditional on considerable amendment - both as regards substance anddrafting - of various of its provisions,          I understand that the promoters have prepared a
separate Bill for application to Scotland, but that as no opportunity has arisen for its presentation they contemplate that provisions for the purpose might be inserted in theEnglish Bill.                                J .G.HOME OFFICE:21st March,  1933.
