TO  BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to     ensure the secrecy of this dooument.                                     Copy No......           Memorandum by the Home Secretary.          In pursuance of the recommendations  of  the MayCommittee, which were approved by the  Government,  the  cut  inpolice pay took effect in two instalments.   The  first instalment of the police cut was imposed  by  regulation for aperiod of twelve months from the 1st October,  1931.    When thequestion came up for review towards the end  of this period, itwas found impossible, owing to the preoccupations of  theGovernment at that time, to reach a decision as to the secondinstalment of the cut before the date  of  expiry of the regulation of 1931.   It was therefore decided to make anemergency regulation continuing the first instalment  of the cut until the 31st October, 1932:  and subsequently it wasdecided to impose the full cut for a period  of 11 months asfrom the 1st November, 1932, (i.e. to  the end  of  September, 1933).          The existing practice of making the  economy cut  fora period of 12 months is peculiar to the  police.    It  is agreat pity that the practice was ever  introduced,  and there iseverything to be said for getting rid  of  it  as soon as possible.The police cut, like the cuts imposed  on  other public services,should be imposed without an express time limit,  on theunderstanding that it will be subject  to  review as and whenthe financial condition of the  country makes it possible tomodify the general economy programme.CAB I N B T .9(33)THE 105S CUT IN POLICE PAY.
HOME OFFICE:     16th March, 1933 .                          -2-          Normally, the meeting of the Police Council to he held next September for the purpose of providing for thecontinuance of the cut would have been the appropriateoccasion for introducing this change of practice.   But, asit happens, the Higgins Committee on the pay of new entrants to the police have proposed scales for newly recruitedConstables and Sergeants on the basis of X shillings a weekless a 10$ abatement.   It is considered therefore that thechange of practice now proposed should be made when thePolice Council meets early in April to consider the HigginsCommittee recommendations.   At that Council the policerepresentatives will.no doubt ask whether it is theGovernment&apos;s intention to continue the 3.0% cut in police payafter September next, and, as this question has already beendecided in principle, it seems to be desirable to take theearliest opportunity of informing the Police Council of theGovernment&apos;s decision.  To change the present practice inApril instead of September will have the additional advantage(from the point of view of the Metropolitan Police) that weshall not be involved in a new and troublesome question somemonths hence, at a. time when, it is to be hoped, thedifficulties arising out of the revised arrangements for theMetropolitan Police will be settling down.
