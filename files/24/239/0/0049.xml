S ^DOCUMENT  IS  THE PROPERTY  OF HIS BRITANITIC HATE8^\S GOVERNMENT.RRT.COPY NO. 4 7                      CAB I IT E T.           Export Credits for Munitions of War.    Mem or an dug &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.     I think that when my colleagues are considering therecommendations of the Committee of Imperial Defence on theposition of the private armaments industry in Imperialdefence, it may he useful for them GO have a statement ofthe problems raised by the question of providing export credits for munitions of war, and I have therefore had theattached note prepared for their consideration.\7. R.Board of Trade,   8th April, 1933.
-1-         Export Credit Guarantees for Munitions of War.   1. The Overseas Trade (Grcdit and Insurance) Act, 1920,which first authorised the granting of &quot;credits for the purposesof the export trade did not exclude munitions of war from thescope of tho schemo.   An Act modifying the provisions of the1920 Act was passed in the following year and on that occaoionthe Government accepted an amendment oxcluding munitions of war.The exclusion has been continued in tho various Acts passedsince that dato extending tho life of tho scheme,,   2. The present authority to give guarantees is derivedfrom the Overseas Trade Act, 1930, which extended the period within which new guarantees may be given to the 31st March,1935.   If, therefore, the scheme is to continue after thatdate, fresh legislation will be necessary next yoar and thequestion of continuing the scheme, with or without modifications,will come up for consideration next autumn in connection withthe legislative programme of next year.   3V Legislation has been passed from time to timesafeguarding the position of United Kingdom industriesregarded as vital for defence purposes.   Notable examples arethe Safeguarding of Industries Act, 1921, under which a keyindustry duty was imposed on the imports of certain goods, eeg.,optical glass and instruments, hosiery latch needles, finechemicals, in order to maintain an adequate home industry.The Dyestuffs Act, 1920, under which imports of dyestuffsare regulated, had in view the defence aspects of the dyestuffs industry cs well as its importance to trade generally.Both these measures are still in force   At the present timethe question whether the system of licensing importeddyestuffs should be replaced by a customs duty is underconsideration by the Import Duties Advisory Committee from thetrade point of view, and, as was announced in the House ofCommons, whon tho Government have received the Committee*3report, they will refer it to the Committee of Imperial
Defence in order chat the def enoe aspects may be invest!gated.   4. These measures have been taken in order to maintainadequate supplies of commodities needed by  this country for defence purposes, but hitherto successive Governments have refused to help the export trade in munitions of war byguaranteeing export credits.  It ha3 no doubt been feltthat different considerations apply to the  maintenance ofindustries required for our own needs in war and to assistingour manufacturers to obtain orders for supplying foreign government with munitions of war which uiight conceivably be uoed against this country.  This distinction may now require modification in view of the conclusion reached by the PrincipalSupply Officers Committee in their report of the &apos;:lst March(C.I.D. paper No. 1109(b)).        - In view of the reduced demands of  the Home       Government, it is clear that if the  armaments and       shipbuilding industries are to have  an adequate potential       capacity tor production in war they  must be able to       obtain a steady supply of foreign orders, which except       perhaps in the case of the aircraft  industry, is not now       forthcoming on a sufficient scale&apos;1 .   5. It should perhaps be explained that there is no statutory bar to giving export credits for  the building of ships,other than naval craft, in this country on  foreign order.  Thebuilding of a few ships has been assisted in this way, but the3card of trade have, generally speaking, set their face againstassistance to the building of foreign ships owing to the prevailing redundancy of tonnage, the unfairness of making available for foreign shipowners facilities not available forBritish shipowners and the desirability of  avoiding any actiontending to encourage by our example foreign oountries  to stimulate shipbuilding by artificial aids.  The final decisionof the Board of Trade, which hag been followed ever since, was announced by Mr. William Graham in the House of commons on   the c-th July, 19&quot;;.l in the following terras:-
                                                       f/ W     &quot;With regard to credits for ships,  Hi3 Majesty&apos;s      Government, in view of all the circumstances and      especially the existing glut of tonnage,  consider that      Government guarantees should not &quot;oe given for the      &quot;building of ocean going vessels for whatever country      they may be destined.&quot;     These arguments would not,  of course,  apply to warships.  6. In this connection it might be mentioned that under  theTrade Facilities Acts, the Government were empowered to renderfinancial assistance by jaiaranteeing loans for shipbuildingwhether for our own mercantile marine or for those of foreigncountries.   Under this scheme guarantees for shipbuildinggiven by the Treasury amounted to approximately  20 million which sum has now been reduced by repayments to an amountoutstanding of approximately  13 million.   These guaranteeshave been severely criticised as facilitating the building of ships for which there was no economic justification andaccentuating the redundancy of tonnage which is a matter ofsuch grave concern to-day.   The Exchequer has already been called upon to implement guarantees of a substantial amount.The Trade Facilities Acts expired in March, 1927, and no government assistance is at present available for the building of ships in Great Britain, though in northern Ireland the loans Guarantee Acts (which are similar to our TradeFacilities Acts) are still in force.  7. The Export Credits Guarantee Department would ofcourse welcome any widening of the basis of its operations-.. ,which would secure a greater spread of risks and for thisreason would favour the inclusion in the scheme of munitions.of war, especially as, according to their information, foreign government are normally most reluctant to default in, respectof such purchases.
     3.  In conclusion it  may be convenient  to  summarisecertain objections which  in the past have been put forward by various Departments to extending the scheme to munitions of war apart from general political considerations:-     (i) Under the terms  of the Trade Agreement with Russiacredit facilities for the export of arms to that country couldnot be refused if they were given in respect of similarforeign transactions.  This difficulty will, of course,disappear on the 17th April when the Agreement expires.If and when a new Agreement is negotiated the Russians would no doubt press to be treated on the same footing as  other foreign countries in respect of export credits whatever  their scope might be for the time  being.     (ii) Even if the scheme were extended to munitions  ofwar, it is not certain how far credits 7/ould become  available.Applications for guarantees in respect of war material wouldhave to be considered by the Advisory Committee of  the export credits Guarantee Department on a business basis in  common with all other applications and the Committee might be reluctant to recommend the Department to guarantee payment byoertain foreign Governments whose financial position is  doub t9ful in  spite of the  considerations mentioned in paragraph 7.     (iii) Even if the Department were ready to give aguarantee, it is by no means certain that  the manufacturersconcerned would be able  to get the order as foreign countries,such  as Italy, might give a direct subsidy  to the  manufacturerif they were bent on  securing  the order.     (iv) The period of  credit demanded for armaments is usually lengthy.  The Treasury have hitherto not regarded withfavour  the granting  of credits for periods exceeding threeyears and have, in feet, limited the amount which  theDepartment is authorised to guarantee in this way.   Ordersfor war material, especially for warships,  run into largefigures and  if  the Department  were to do business  in respectof lar^e  armament and naval orders,  the existing  limit would no doubt  have to be  revised.
