Report by  the Chiefs of  Staff Sub-Committee.    1.  IN accordance with the terms of our Warrant,  under which  we areinstructed  to submit for consideration any matter relating to Imperial defence on which, in our opinion, further enquiry or investigation is necessary, we havebeen  re-examining the strategical  situation in the Far  East  in  the  light ofrecent events.    2.  We are well aware that His Majesty&apos;s Government are seized with theimportance of avoiding any step liable to precipitate a crisis in which this country.whether as a Member of the League of Nations or alone, would be involved as abelligerent in the Far East.  The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs made ourposition in the matter perfectly clear in the House of Commons as recently asthe 27th February, 1933.    3.  In every year since 1919  the weakness of our military position in theFar East has been brought  to the notice of the Committee of Imperial Defence.The last  occasion was a  year  ago, when we submitted two  Reports on thesubject (OLD. Papers  Nos.  1082-B and 1084-B).  Since  then  nothing has happened to alleviate the situation, and it is therefore unnecessary to describe it in which detail.  It is sufficient  to mention that  the Naval  Base  at  Singapore isthe pivot  of our whole naval  strategical position in the Far East; that, untilprovided with  adequate  defences, the Naval Base and its  facilities are liable to capture or destruction by a coup de main before our main fleet can  arrive on the scene; that its re-capture would be  a major operation of the greatest difficulty;that,  in the meantime, the important Naval Base at Hong Kong would  be liableto shai&quot;e the same fate as  Singapore;  that  British territory in the Far East.including  the  coasts  of India, Australia, New  Zealand, and of the  variousColonies and Protectorates, would  be exposed to depredation ;*  and that our trade and communications in the Eastern Hemisphere would be, to a large extent.at the mercy of the enemy.  With the aid of the Dominion of New Zealand, theColonies of Singapore and  Hong-Kong and  the rulers of the Federated malay states,  some progress has  been  made for the provision of a Naval  Base at singapore.  Up to now, however, the question of the defences has not been tackledin earnest, with the result that the resources of the Naval  Base offer an invitingobjective for an enemy desiring to dislocate our  entire system of Imperial defence in the Pacific before the arrival of the Main Fleet.      * In this connection attention ia directed to paragraphs 22-24 of 0.1.1). Paper No. 184-1).       [8417]                                                       B
    4.  In our Annual Review for 1932, after examining the anxious situation that had arisen since Japan had found it necessary to intervene first in Manchuriain September 1931,  and afterwards in Shanghai, we went so far as to make thefollowing forecast:         &quot;  17. We see no  reason  why the present anxious situation in the Far    East should not continue for a long time to  come.   The chaos in China is    perhaps greater than at any time since the  end  of  the war.   The  Chino-    Japanese difficulties are deep-seated, and neither the League of Nations nor    the United States of America has made progress in their efforts at permanent    conciliation.  Japan  has  pursued her policy  with  disregard  to both.  At    the moment the only  likely solution appears to be a Japanese coercion of    China, but that might easily create great difficulties between the Powers and    Japan.&quot;    5.  That forecast has been justified by the events of  the past year.  We see no reason why  the same state of affairs should not continue, even if the present difficulties  are  disposed of and relative tranquillity  restored for a time.  It isnot unlikely that in the years to come the course of events may continue to bepunctuated by crises involving anxiety and  embittering the situation from yearto year.  Information at our disposal, which we  believe  to be reliable, leads usto think that Japan does not wish at the present time  to antagonise western europe.  The cumulative effect, however, of a series of what Japan may interpretas pin-pricks, exasperating a proud and sensitive nation, must not be disregarded.There have been  many warnings from His  Majesty&apos;s Ambassador  at Tokyo tothe effect that  the imposition of sanctions on Japan  by  the League of nations would probably be followed by war.  Some  of these were quoted a year  ago-inour Report C.I.D. Paper No. 1084-B, but during the last two months the warningshave been renewed.  For example, on the 9th February, His Majesty&apos;s ambassador at Tokyo reported that the Netherlands Minister, a well-balanced and experiencedman.  was warning his Government that a threat  of sanctions would not  merelybe  resisted, but  might well be answered  by immediate  hostile  acts withoutdeclaration of  war.  Again, on the  2nd  March, he  reported that a JapaneseGeneral Staff Officer had  told our  Military Attache that sanctions would befollowed by war.    6.  The weakness of  our present position invites attack, and the naval  andmilitary authorities in Japan, whose influence with the Government is very strongat the present  time, are no doubt  well aware of  the facts.  In this connection,secret information was recently received from the Far East to the effect that theJapanese have  a scheme for an attack on Singapore by a force consisting of one division, probably accompanied by light artillery.  It was stated that this force was actually  ready  to embark at the time of the Shanghai crisis in 1932, and ispossibly ready now.  It could reach  Singapore in from eight to ten days.   Inthese circumstances, we wish to emphasise once more that, if strained relations should occur  with Japan,  she can,  without warning, inflict crushing blows on us from which we should with difficulty recover.    7.  The  importance of the Naval Bases at  Hong  Kong and Singapore is emphasised by  a  re-examination of the situation which has recently been under-taken in the  Admiralty.   In the long run the availability of both these bases intime of war in  the Far East is essential.  Singapore is the indispensable base for naval operations  to protect the trade and territory of  the British Commonwealthof Nations in the Eastern  Hemisphere and, as often pointed out, the fortress mustbe strong enough  to hold out until the arrival of the Main Fleet from the Mediter-ranean  and the United Kingdom.   Hong Kong is necessary if we are to be ableto bring our sea-power to bear for the protection of our interests in China  and for effective pressure on our enemy.     8.  If Singapore were adequately defended, our Naval  Forces in the far east, basing themselves upon Hong Kong, might  hope to accomplish a good deal to aid the  relatively weak garrison and defences of Hong Kong by attacks on theenemy&apos;s transports, their  escort and sea communications, as well as on his MainFleet in that area.
    9.  The  present strategical situation in the Far  East, however,  is funda-meutally unsound in  that our  weak forces  are divided  and are less  than everadequate to defend either Singapore or Hong Kong properly.    10.  As  already mentioned, if we were to lose Singapore, the Main Fleetwould be prevented from operating in the East until it  had been recaptured, and,as a consequence,  the fall of Hong Kong would inevitably  ensue in the meanwhile.In these circumstances the Chiefs of Staff have  had to  consider what steps couldbe taken  to  make more secure first the position at Singapore  and then at hong Kong.                                 Singapore.    11.  Expediting  the permanent programme. We  have  no hesitation in expressing our conviction that the situation must remain  one of gravest pre-occupation until  such time as the base at Singapore is  adequately defended inaccordance with the programme already worked out.  Our first recommendation,therefore, is  that the programme for the completion of  the permanent defencesshall  be expedited.   One advantage of  this course will be that each year thesituation will be a little better than the year before.  The existing gun programmecan be accelerated by obtaining a  larger sum in the estimates for 1934-35  and1935-36.  It  is probable that by this means the work could be completed in atotal  term of 3^-  years  in the place of 5  years, i.e., by the middle of 1936.Approximately  700,000 would  be required  for the first year 1934-35  and approximately  725,000 divided between 1935-36 and 1936-37.  In order to carryout this acceleration authority  must be given by the 1st  October  of this year inorder that the necessary preliminaries may  be  put in hand.  Further  details ofthis proposal are given in the appendix to this  Report.    In addition the provision of air forces required for co-operation in the defenceincluding the preparation of a second aerodrome should be expedited. At presentthe Air Force have no alternative to the existing aerodrome, and it is thereforeimpossible to obtain the degree of  dispersion  which  is necessary for security against air attack.  The cost of the second aerodrome would be approximately 50,000, though it may be found possible to  reduce this figure as the result of an investigation which is now in progress.    Again the Naval Seaward Defences should be hastened.   These  consist ofthe anti-submarine and  torpedo nets and boom vessels,  costing  44,000 beyondmoney already included in the Naval Estimates of 1933.    it is  also necessary that work should be started on the Joint  Armament and mining Depot required to store ammunition and explosives for the two Services,and the Port  War Signal and Mine Control Stations, costing in all approximately. 800,000, spread over six years, of which  15,000 is required this year.    12.  Immediate Measures. Apart  from the expediting  of  the permanentdefences, to which we attach the greatest importance, we have considered whether there are any immediate steps either of a provisional or anticipatory character which can be taken to render the situation at Singapore less perilous.  The Chiefof the Naval Staff has in contemplation certain dispositions which will improve the local  defence  situation,  including the local seaward defences.    13.   In our preliminary examination of the possible immediate measures wehave  considered whether it  would be possible to make some immediate increase to the military garrison, which at present consists of only one British and oneIndian Battalion, the latter being stationed at Taiping. In  addition there are three volunteer battalions allotted to assist  in the defence of the fortress.     Barrack accommodation does not yet exist for  any extra infantry unit, andit would,  therefore, be impossible, pending the  construction  of barracks, to makeany permanent and immediate increase in the garrison, except to bring the RoyalArtillery and Royal Engineer  manning details up  to  strength sufficient to manfully the existing defences at some time during  the next trooping season.     14.   Apart from these practical considerations, political  factors  cannot be ignored.   In the  present situation in the Far  East the movement of troops to singapore might be viewed with concern by Japan and tend to influence adverselythe situation in the Far East, which  at the  present moment  shows signs of becoming less tense.       [8417]                                                      B 2
     15.  These difficulties,  however,  do not apply to the same degree in con-nection with a reinforcement of the Royal Air Force, and we recommend that anadditional Squadron from Home establishment should be stationed at Singapore.In conjunction  with the Torpedo-bombing Squadron and the Squadron of flying boats already stationed at Singapore, this reinforcement will provide an increaseddeterrent to seaborne attack.     16.  We have  instructed the Joint Planning  Committee to make a further study of the question of immediate measures and to formulate proposals in detail.     17.  Emergency  Measures Last of  all  we  come to the  possibility  ofemergency measures Avhich might be required if trouble should arise with Japanbefore the full defence programme is completed. This problem formed the subjectof one of our Reports of a year ago (C.I.D. Paper No. 1084-B). So far as the Navyis concerned, it would seem that our strategy in the Far East, in case of emergency,will temporarily have  to aim at delaying any Japanese attack on Singapore bydisposing the British naval  forces on the Station, so as to locate and dajfcyar/any japanese expedition and so to gain as much time as  possible  for the arrival ofIndian reinforcements.  By  Naval means it might be possible to harrass consider-ably any enemy expedition,  though, of course,  such action would entail leaving the defence of Hong Kong almost entirely to the military  garrison, unsupportedin any way by naval or air forces.     18.  So far as the military  garrison  of Singapore is  concerned, the  mostimportant step  is to work out detailed plans for reinforcements in an emergency.For this it will be necessary  to assume that reinforcements will be made available from India.  We are taking up this question with a  view to the elaboration, inconsultation with  the  General  Staff  in  India, of more detailed  plans  than atpresent exist.     19.  In addition to the  above, plans exist for the reinforcement of Singaporeon an emergency by two Squadrons of aeroplanes from  India (provided the indian government approved) and  one Squadron from Iraq;  and these  reinforcementswould be made  available.     20.  It is again emphasised, however, that such action as it might be possibleto take, if an emergency should arise between now and the  date of the completionof the base at Singapore, could not compensate for the lack  of the full defences,and might not even be effective in the very  limited time available before hostileattacks could be developed.   Anxiety can only be allayed when the full programmeof defences for  Singapore is  completed.                                Hong  Kong.    21.  In considering generally this question it is desired  to draw attention tothe fact that in  China there are at the moment  six battalions, which number hasbeen approved by the  Cabinet as the minimum  possible.  Their disposition  is asfollows .     ^ jjong j 0Ug : 3  Battalions.            At Shanghai:  2 Battalions.            At Tientsin :  1 Battalion.    22.  Our military policy in the Far East has always aimed at concentratingin Hong Kong  the  various battalions allotted to  the  China Command.   It has never been possible to  implement  this policy practically, because  it is necessaryfor one battalion to be at Tientsin for the protection of the Legation at Pekin.and, since the troubles in Shanghai in 1927, two battalions have been quarteredat Shanghai.   In  existing  circumstances,  the  only course  open to us  for the reinforcement of Hong Kong is to collect the outlying battalions from Tientsinand Shanghai into the fortress at Hong Kong itself.   If left in their presentpositions until war is imminent,  it is  extremely unlikely that they could ever begot away before war broke  out,  and  for that  reason we  should take an early opportunity of removing to Hong Kong two battalions at least at Shanghai.  Thiscourse would have the effect of  increasing the  chances  of a more  prolongedresistance if Japan attacked Hong Kong as a first act  of war, although there areno aircraft stationed  at  Hong Kong and  the possibility of  sending aircraft at short notice is extremelv remote.
SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS.    23.  Our  Conclusions  and  Recommendations  may  be  summarised  asfollows:     (1) If strained relations occur with Japan she can, without warning, inflict          crushing blows on us from which we should with difficulty recover.(2) Expediting the Permanent Defence. The situation must remain one of      gravest preoccupation until such  time as the  Base at Singapore is      adequately defended  in accordance  with  the programme  already      worked out.  No emergency arrangements can compensate for the lack      of the full permanent defences, and we recommend that His Majesty&apos;s      Government should expedite the programme for their completion, as      suggested  in paragraph  11.(3) Immediate Measures. In  addition  to  certain dispositions which  the      Chief of  the  Naval Staff has in view, we recommend that the Royal      Air  Force at  Singapore  should  be reinforced  by  an additional      Squadron  from Home  establishment.   The possibility  of  further      immediate measures is being studied.(4) Emergency Measures will consist, first, of naval dispositions designed to      gain as much time as possible to permit the arrival of reinforcements;      second, of the working out of detailed plans for the reinforcement of      the garrison in emergency; and. third, of reinforcements of aircraft.(5)  In peacetime it should be our aim to concentrate as many as possible of      our Battalions in China at  Hong Kong, where they will enable the      garrison to prolong its existence against any sudden attack.  For this      reason we  should take an  early opportunity of  removing  to Hong      Kong the two Battalions at present at Shanghai.Singapore.Hong Kong.(Signed)ERNLE  CHATFIELD.A.  A.

THE  SITUATION  IN THK FAR  EAST.                          (C.I.D. Paper No. 1103-B.)     (Previous reference: OLD. Minutes of the 255th  Meeting. Minute 5.)     THE COMMITTEE  had under consideration a Report  (OLD.  Paper No. 1103-B) by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Coiumittee dealing with the situation in the Far East.     THE PRIME MINISTER said this Report by the Chiefs of  Staff included the question of the defences of Singapore, and showed that the Chiefs of Staff were very anxious in regard to the present position and weie also working  out certain plans.   He emphasised that it was  impossible to overlook the political situation in the Far East with its immediate reactions on the military situation. He thought it was generally accepted that the political situation in that area had deteriorated during the last eighteen months to two years.     SIR ERNLE CHATFIELD* explained to the Committee the j*ist  of  the Chiefs of Staffs&apos; Report and referred particularly to the Summary of Conclusions on page 5.  He informed the  Committee of the particulars  of the strategy con- templated by the Admiralty for the employment of their Naval Forces in the Far East in existing  circumstances.    Referring to the  &quot; immediate &quot;  proposals contained in the Report, he referred to the Admiralty intentions in regard to  the local defences of Singapore and added certain additional information.  Finally. he explained briefly the &quot; emergency &quot; plans which the Chiefs of Staff contem- plated and added that these plans were now under active consideration.     SIR  JOHN SIMON  said that one recommendation in this  very striking- Report touched very closely the Foreign Office.   He referred to conclusion  No. 5. which read as follows :          &quot; In peace time it should be our aim to concentrate as many as possible    of our battalions in China at Hong Kong, where they will enable the garrison    to prolong its existence against any sudden attack. For this reason we should    take an early opportunity of removing to Hong Kong the two battalions at    present at Shanghai.&quot; This was a matter which was bound to  be considered in relation to its diplomatic repercussions.  It was a question  which, he thought, had been before the Com- mittee of Imperial Defence before.  His recollection on that occasion  was that one of two battalions  should be withdrawn from Shanghai to Hong  Kong.  Hejust wanted to remind the Committee  that the consequences of the  withdrawal of both battalions from Shanghai might be serious and that political considera- tions would need to be weighed before  any final  decision was made.  He felt itwould be difficult to abandon altogether British interests at Shanghai  by effecting&apos;     * A FULL summary OF these remarks IS ON record IN the Secretary^ tile copy of THE MINUTES.*[8441-2]B
the withdrawal of both battalions, more particularly since other Powers would retain forces at Shanghai.  He thought that Sir Miles Lampson should be askedfor his opinion and he  felt sure that he would regard any such proposal withanxiety.  He suggested that the psychological effect on the whole of the situationin the Far East would have to be weighed. He fully  understood  that,  from a major strategic  point of view.  Hong Kong was  of greater  importance thanShanghai.   At the same time, he thought the situation should be considered that,if trouble was again  to arise  at Shanghai, we might live very much to regrethaving withdrawn our garrison therefrom.  He was not wishing to oppose thesuggestion  to withdraw these two battalions, but he  did urge that the political considerations which he had put forward should be carefully weighed before any final decision was made.    SIR ERNLE  CHATFIELD said he fully sympathised  with the foreign secretary in what he  had said, but the Chiefs &quot;of &quot;Staff had had to consider thesituation as it might  develop  and had been forced to  realise that there might come  a time when these battalions would have to be withdrawn or  we shouldhave to run the risk of losing them altogether,  and the psychological moment atwhich to make any withdrawal would be most difficult to choose.    THE PRIME MINISTER  thought that  the  complete withdrawal of ourgarrison  from Shanghai might have rather disastrous results.    SIR MAURICE  HANKEY  remarked that  the  Report was not recom-mending that  both  battalions  should be  withdrawn  at once, and  consequentlythat one battalion could be withdrawn at a time.    LORD HAILSHAM said he also fully appreciated the Foreign Secretary&apos;spoint. The War Office, however,  could not help feeling that, if serious troublearose  with  a foreign Power in the Far East, we might bitterly regret having anisolated garrison at Shanghai who might be virtually in the position of hostagesto the enemy.  If one  battalion could be withdrawn to Hong Kong,  the situation would be greatly improved.  The matter was one of some urgency, because therewas no accommodation at Shanghai for the second battalion, and at Hong  Kongthe same question had also arisen.  At Hong Kong, however, there was a site,-anda  decision  was required within the next  few months  and was  at the  presentmoment,  in fact, the  subject of consultations  with the Foreign Office and theColonial Office. He would like to emphasise that, in the event of a major war inthe Far East, we could not possibly defend Shanghai, and any garrison which was there  at  the time must inevitably be sacrificed. For this reason he thought hewas expressing the views of all the Services when he said that they were most anxious not to keep a garrison at  Shanghai at  any time if there was any dangerof such a war.  To increase the garrison of Hong Kong was a matter of  greatimportance, because it was extremely  difficult for  the defence of Hong Kong tobe undertaken without the Navy.  He would, also, remind Sir John Simon that,if an  outbreak should occur at Shanghai, it would  only take three  days to movetroops from Hong  Kong to Shanghai, so that,  in  reality, we should not beabandoning Shanghai altogether.    THE  PRIME  MINISTER  asked  what other  nations  had  troops at shangai.    SIR  JOHN SIMON said the  United  States of  America  and  France-certainly.  He also pointed out that, aS the present moment, we had got there a senior Military Commander who was ready to play a  leading part in control and advice.  He was very anxious that the political  considerations should be carefullyweighed.   The proposal to withdraw both battalions  was a new one.    LORD HAILSHAM  agreed  and said he thought it  only right  that  theCommittee  of Imperial Defence should  have the whole picture.  As  to  the garrisons at present in Singapore, we had 2,200 Regular troops plus the ShanghaiVolunteer  Force, the  United States had 1,772. the Japanese had 1,937,  and  theFrench  had 1,982, though these latter  troops were  confined  to the  Frenchconcession  and did not form part of the  International Force.    THE  PRIME MINISTER  asked whether it was contemplated  that our troops should be withdrawn and the French and American troops left.
     LORD HAILSHAM  said  he thought the American troops were  mostly marines.     SIR  JOHN  SIMON  said  it  was  his  recollection  of  the  Shanghai disturbances that an elaborate plan had been drawn up which divided Shanghai into sectors which were allotted amongst the  International Force.  He did not dispute the strategic position for one moment,  but he was concerned  with the result of our being placed in the position that we had no British troops for the International Force.     LORD HAILSHAM,  in reply to a question from the Prime Minister, said that British forces were sent to Shanghai in 1927 when the crisis arose, and this-again  was  only then intended  as  a  temporary measure.  He  reiterated that Hong  Kong was the natural base for these troops, and  that  they could be very-quickly sent back to Shanghai  in time of emergency.     THE PRIME MINISTER understood that the  approval of the Committeeof Imperial Defence was sought to these proposals and that any movement of troops was to be made at our convenience.  He  suggested it would be necessary to watch the political situation, and particularly  our position vis-a-vis the Iuterna- tional Force.  He thought that  one battalion  might be moved now and that no action should be taken in regard to the second battalion until the position had been reconsidered.     LORD HAILSHAM pointed out that  there would be no  accommodation for the second  battalion at Shanghai at the end of  the present year.   The War Office was undertaking the repair of  barracks in Hong Kong which would provide accommodation for two battalions, but it was  essential that they had a decision on this question before October of this year.   There was no intention of moving any troops  from Shanghai immediately.     SIR JOHN SIMON again emphasised that if it was proposed to remove both  battalions  from  Shanghai  he thought  Sir Miles  Lampson ought  to  be consulted.     THE PRIME MINISTER  said he thought  it was agreed that one  battalion could  be moved now or in the immediate future, but that no action should be taken  in regard to the second battalion without  further consideration  of the diplomatic situation.     SIR  BOLTON EYRES-MONSELL  drew particular attention  to  para- graph 11,   and  to the  fact  that  a  small  increase in Navy  estimates was foreshadowed.     MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that although, at the Treasury,  it was felt that the risks of the financial situation were perhaps more  pressing than  the risks from Japanese aggression, he was greatly impressed by the case  which  had been put forward, and he would  not raise any serious objections.     In the summary of conclusions No. 2 dealt with the general  strength of the defences.  He did not propose to raise any objection provided there was no seriousaddition to coast defence expenditure.  He presumed that what was intended was that Singapore should have priority.  In  paragraph 11 he noticed that there was;a suggestion to spend money on  a second aerodrome.  This question had been tothe Cabinet before, and had on  that occasion  been rejected, though it had beenagreed that the question might be brought up again.  He hoped that this expendi- ture would not be included in the general approval to the other proposals.   As to the naval  seaward defences mentioned in paragraph  11,  he understood that the-cost was put at  44,000, which would be found  by the Admiralty.  He would have no objection. There was also a further, and he thought new, proposal in the last sub-paragraph which read as follows :         &quot; It is also necessary that work should be started on the  joint armament     and mining depot required  to store ammunition  and explosives for the two     Services, and  the Port  War Signal  and Mine Control Stations, costing in     all approximately  800,000, spread over six years, of  which  15,000 is     required this year.&quot;He did not propose to offer objections to this suggestion.      [8441-2]
    Reverting  again tp the conclusions, he  saw in 3  that  it  was  proposedto reinforce the garrison by an additional air force squadron from home establish-ment.  He would  have no objection  provided it was not suggested that this squadron should.be replaced by a new&apos;squadron at home.  &apos;  LORD LONDONDERRY agreed that the question of the  second aerodromehad been considered by the Cabinet, but  pointed out that it had been left in sucha condition as to permit of the question being reopened at any time.  If it was proposed to expedite the general defences of Singapore, then he thought the airarrangements should follow, and if the  defences of Singapore were going to hestrengthened  in  relation to any crisis, it was essential for a second aerodrome tobe built.                                                            ; .    THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that in any case the whole question would have to be considered by the Cabinet.    LORD LONDONDERRY  added that he was npt suggesting that he wouldrequire a special estimate fpr this second  aerodrome, because he thought a  gooddeal could be done without extra funds.  He would like to add also that, from thepoint of view pf economy, the air could help in the defence very much.    SIR EDGAR LUDLOW  HEWITT said  that  the Chiefs  of Staff  Sub-Committee had had  before them, in addition  to the  question of expediting thepermanent defences, what  measures could be carried out between now and thetime of completion pf these defences  should an emergency arise.   The questionof reinforcing Singapore was difficult, and the Sub-Committee had thought thatone squadron could be sent out without arousing any particular comment, andwould  provide  a  useful  deterrent before  the main gun  defences  could  becompleted, but the sending of this squadron raised at once the aerodrome question.There  was only one  aerodrome at  Singapore, and if this was attacked the AirFprce  would  have nowhere else to go.   They were  most  anxious to have  analternative and to avoid putting  all their  eggs  into one  basket.  He would emphasise that, whatever happened, it would be necessary to have more than oneaerodrome  at  Singapore.   He  hoped, therefore, that it might  be  possible torecommend the provision fjri - alternative aerodrome accommodation.in additionto the Air  Force squadroinAvhich he understood would be sent out to Singapore.as soon as possible as part of the permanent defences,  in  order to provide a deterrent.    THE  PRIME MINISTER  said it  was necessary  to  draw a distinctionbetween the possible and  probable, and in  the present instance  he thought itwould  be difficult to  make  provision  for  what he might, perhaps, call theimpossible.   The  whole report must, in  any case, go to the  Cabinet, and therequest for the second aerodrome could  be considered  then.    He asked theChancellor of the Exchequer to confirm  that he had no objection to a favourablerecommendation going forward on  all the other points.    MR.  CHAMBERLAIN agreed.    THE PRIME MINISTER then said that these points would be referred tothe Cabinet.    MR.  BRUCE* said the question of  Singapore was a vital one to Australia.He  thought that it was generally recognised that the situation in the  Far  east was the most  perilous in  the world to-day, and he  imagined that the ForeignOffice would  have no  objections  to raise with  the  report  in this sense.   Hecommented on the statements in the Report as to the vital importance of singapore and the-difficulty  of recapturing it if it were lost.   Fie. also, emphasised the greatly increased danger  to Australia under  such conditions.  In fact,  shouldsuch a position arise,  Australia  might have  to swing:her  policy and allocategreater expenditure to forces fpr the purpose of repelling attack, and, if this was so,  it would  mean that the expenditure  would have to be deducted  from thepresent naval  expenditure.  This,  in  turn, would lead to a  larger naval burdenbeing placed  on Great Britain.  He  said that Australia would be prepared tostretch herself  to the maximum,  but  that unless Singapore were adequatelydefended  she  might have  to  orient her  defence expenditure in another  way..                             * See footnote on page 7.
There was another point he would  like to make clear.    Australia had nevercontributed  directly, as had  New  Zealand,  to the Singapore base, but she hadtaken on a definite programme of two 10,000-ton cruisers, the Canberra and theA itstralia, and had made provision for the maximum defence vote in this respect:In addition,  she had, of course, assumed  liability for the maintenance of thesetwo cruisers.  He wished to  make it clear,  therefore, that Australia had takenher share in Singapore in another  direction, and, as a result, she felt entitled tojoin in discussions in regard to this  most important question.   It certainlyseemed to Australia that the situation  in  the Far East was the most dangerous,and that Singapore was the corner-stone of Imperial defence in that region, andthat everything ought to be done to expedite the completion of the defences andto do away with the present  hazardous situation.    THE PRIME MINISTER said  that the question, of course,  was oneprimarily of finance.   Everyone realised, he hoped, that the Government were working on a very narrow margin.  At the same time it was obviously impossibleto promise  that  there  would be  no extra expenditure.   It must  be  clearly understood that there would be no  big extension  of  expenditure, because thiswould be out of the question.    (The Prime Minister left the meeting at this point and his place as Chairmanwas taken by the Lord President of the Council.)    SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL asked if the Foreign Office would have any objection to certain naval dispositions, which the First Lord had suggested.He realised that to move battle cruisers might cause alarm, but he did not thinkthat  the movements  proposed  by  Admiral  Chatfield  could  possibly   be misinterpreted.    SIR ROBERT VANSITTART  agreed that there was no political objection.    SIR MAURICE HANKEY asked if instructions could be given to  him toprepare the minutes which would  be circulated on  this item in an abbreviatedform.  A full record would be kept by him and would be available for referenceif required.    MR. BALDWIN agreed.                           CONCLUSIONS.THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed I. To approve generally the Report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee      (OLD.  Paper No.  1103-B),  subject to modifications which  are  set      forth below :                              Singapore.      (a) Expediting of Permanent Defences. That the programme for  the            completion of the permanent defences should be expedited, and            that the work should be completed in a total term of 3^ years            in place of 5  years, i.e., by the middle of 1936, subject to  the            reservation for the decision of the Cabinet of the proposal in            paragraph 11 for the provision of a second aerodrome.      (b) Immediate measures. That  the  Admiralty should be authorised            to make  certain  dispositions which they have  in view  for            strengthening the defences of Singapore at the present time,            and tuso that the garrison should be reinforced by an additional            squadron of the Royal Air Force  from  home establishment on            the understanding that no replacement for this squadron is            contemplated at the present time.      (c) Emergency measures. To  approve  the  proposal  to work   out            detailed plans for the reinforcement of  the garrison of singapore-            pore should an emergency occur between the present time and            the completion of the permanent defences.
                                Hong Kong.           (d) That one battalion should be withdrawn from Shanghai to Hong^                 Kong at the discretion of the War Office; that is to say, as soon                 as suitable accommodation is available; but that the question of                 withdrawing  the second battalion involves political considera-                 tions which would require consultation with our Minister in                 China, and that this question should be postponed until the                 movement of one battalion has taken place.  The question would                 have to be considered in the light of all the circumstances at the                 time.                                     General.    II. That the  Report,  together with  the  above recommendations,  be  for-           warded to the Cabinet.(The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for the Colonies                 withdrew from the meeting at this  point.)******2,  Whitehall Gardens. S.W.1,        April 6.  1933.
