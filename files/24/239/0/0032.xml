Educational Economies, and the pay of       new  entrants to the Teaching Profession.    Memorandum by  the Chancellor or the Exchequer.1.     The President of the Board of  Education has  circu-lated a memorandum  on the  subject  of proposals for (a)reducing the existing number of  teachers, with a i-esultingeconomy to the Exchequer rising  to   570,000  a year  in three years, and (b) reducing by 5% (over and above theexisting ICyfc cut,  which applies  to  existing  teachers andnew entrants alike) -the pay of teachers  entering the profession after 1st April  1934, with a  resulting economy to the Exchequer amounting  to  100,000 a year in three yearsand rising gradually to  1,400,000  a  year.    Equivalenteconomies in each   case will accrue to Local Authorities.2.     The President proposes that, for  the  following reasons, the Government should,  for the  present,aim at sercuring the first of these economies only,  reservinguntil later the question of the  second:-       (l)  Without arguing  the question  whether or  notteachers&apos; salaries are too  high, he  expresses doubts asto the wisdom and expediency of  further  salary cuts, evenin the case of new entrants, on the ground that therewill be bitter opposition on the part of existing teachers  -              x CP.  76 (33).
175 both on  general educational grounds and because the indefinite continuance of the present 10;&apos; cut v/ill be involved -  that many Local Authorities v/ill oppose any  further reduction in the minima or maxima of the scales,  and that, in view of political uncertainties, the  prospect of securing substantial savings in due course from a cut on new entrants is not sufficient to counterbalance the hostility which v/ill be evoked.       (2) He refers to the possibility of political reactions on the  general position of the Government.       (3) he thinks the ill-will aroused by the further reduction of new entrants&apos; pay may seriously prejudice the  smooth attainment of the early economy to be obtained from reduced numbers, and that it would be better policy to secure the latter now in an untroubled atmosphere, reserving the former until some future  date when a final decision is taken about the continuance of the  10%  cut on teachers&apos; salaries, and of other similar  cuts, and when salaries generally are  under review.       (4) Further, he points out that, if it.were  decidednow  to tackle the question of lower pay for new entrants,the  Government would have to choose between referring thematter to the Burnham Committee - in which case there v;ouldat best be disagreement  between the teacher members and theLocal Authority members  of the Committee,  and at worst a united rejection of the  proposal by both panels - andreferring it instead to  an ad hoc Committee, a course whichwould be resented by both panels as a  blow to the principlesof collective bargaining, and would endanger the futureprospect  of agreed national  salary scales,3.      While I appreciate the force of  these arguments, Ithink they are disposed  of by the strength of the case, on merits, for reviewing the salaries of  new  entrants, and bythe fact  that an economy on numbers alone  is not sufficientto meet Budget  needs.
174.   There can be no serious dispute about the  merits of the case for some reduction in the salaries  of  new entrants.   Pour recent Committees,  the May Committee,the Kay Committee, the Private Members EconomyCommittee, and the Lovat Committee in Scotland, have proposed lower salaries, in some form or other, for existing teachers, and therefore a fortiori for new entrants.   The May Committee said that cost of livingconsiderations &quot;point to a reduction in the neighbourhoodof 30$&quot;, but that, having regard to  practical groundsaffecting existing teachers, they could not recommend  as high a cut, even though justified on merits:  they thought20$ (which would still leave the average elementary salaryat more than double the pre-war level) was &quot;the minimumreduction&quot;:  the Government have enforced only 10$, and onthe basis that &quot;it will be reviewed as and when thefinancial position of the country permits&quot;.   The RayCommittee, in view of the Government decision on theMay report, felt unable to touch the maxima and minimaof teachers (they said nothing about new entrantsseparately), but they recommended retarded increments,  for existing teachers and new entrants, at a saving to theState commencing at  117,000 and rising in 27 years to 1,125,000 a year.    (This recommendation cannot now be entertained as it would be tantamount to a further cut in the pay of existing teachers).   The Private Memberssuggested that &quot;^expenditure on teachers&apos; salaries hasincreased  to a sum beyond the capacity of the countryto bear&quot;  and that the whole structure of the present salaryscales should be reconsidered and new scales introduced from april 1933.   The Lovat report proposed that there should bea cut of  15$ on  &quot;Minimum National Scales&quot; for new entrants,that new  &quot;Standard Scales&quot; instead  should be considered,
177that the existing actual scales of Local EducationAuthorities should he reduced generally by 12-^(including any reductions made since 1929), and thatin addition the increments should be retarded in thefirst 8 years of service.5.   If existing teachers view the matter justly, theyshould be able to accept an ad hoc Committee to review the salaries of new entrants as the fair price of obtaining the status quo for themselves in the face of the proposalsfor further reductions made by the Committees.  But ifteachers are not prepared to accept a Committee on this basis, the merits of the case point to the necessity offacing and overcoming their opposition.   I doubt whetherLocal Authorities would raise objection.   They might be reluctant themselves to propose revised scales but theywould probably welcome the adoption of lower scales imposedupon them.6.   Although I am anxious not to make difficulties forthe President in his effort to effect the economies whichwill be secured in the next few years by a reduction inthe number of teachers, I do not think it would be wise to postpone dealing with the question of salary scales for new entrants.  In my view the longer it is put off themore difficult its consideration will become.  Economiesunder both heads are urgently needed.   By 1950 theEducation Votes will be swollen (apart from other increases,which are probably inevitable) by the burden of pensions onback service to the extent of a further sum of the orderof  3 million a year.  The saving on salaries of new entrants, if 5$ is found to be the right deduction, willby that date have resulted in a valuable set-off against this automatic increase of some  700,000 a year, risinglater to  1,400,0&apos;00 a year.
                                                      1737.   Decisions to fix lower scales for new entrants were.taken in the case of the Defence Services in 1925 andprovisionally in the case of the Police in 1931.   In thecase of the Police the question of the final scale for new entrants was referred to an ad hoc Committee appointed &quot;by theHome Secretary in 1931, which has recently reported.There are also precedents outside the Government  service.0.   I recognise the difficulties as regards the  burnham committee to which the President refers and I have come tothe conclusion that the question can only he effectivelyhandled if it is referred to a specially appointed committee as in the case of the Police.  The recommendations of such aCommittee could, if necessary, he referred to the BurnhamCormaittee for discussion before action on them was taken bythe Government.     In conclusions I should like to put before the Cabinetsome general observations.  It is impossible to deny thatthe teachers are a well organised, politically minded body,who have in the past made their influence felt to their owngreat advantage.  There is therefore a strong temptation totake the easy course and leave the matter to be dealt with,as the President suggests, at a future date &quot;when probably the strength of the opposition will be diminished&quot;.  I do notbelieve in this alleged probability.  I have never known the teachers relax their opposition to any proposal which they thought affected their interests adversely.     In  the matter of public expenditure the easy course isgenerally the wrong one.  If we are to take it now, let us at least not deceive ourselves as to what we are  doing and why we are doing it.  Let us not forget either that there is
179a strong &quot;body of opinion among our stoutest supporterswhich continually demands evidence that the Government isfulfilling its pledges in regard to economy and notevading its plain duty for fear of political consequences.     We shall never attach the teachers to us except byunhesitating compliance with any demands they choose tomake0  Let us be sure that we do not alienate those whoare truly the friends of the Rational Government,,                         (lntd0) II.C.Treasury Chambers, S.V/,1.,     March 24th, 1933.
