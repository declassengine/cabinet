T.36&apos;&apos;u3)MINET?S  WELFARE FUND.Memorandum by the President of the          Board of Trade,     I circulate, for the consideration of mycolleagues, a note by the Secretary for Alines onthe Miners&apos; Welfare Fund.   My colleagues will see that the question raised is one of some urgencyas under the Statute the levy is payable on the31st March at the penny rate.   A definite announcementof the Government1s intentions should therefore bemade as soon as possible.     I accordingly ask for authority for theSecretary for Mines to make the statement set outin the penultimate paragraph of his memorandum.                                    W.B.Board of Trade.6th M;;rcti, *19o3.
       MINERS&apos;  WgLEARg FUND (MINING INDUSTRY ACT,  1930)               Report of Comm&apos;.ttee of Inquiry.     The Miners&apos; Welfare Fund was instituted by Section 20 ofthe Mining Industry Act, 1920) &quot;for such purposes connected&quot;with the social wellbeinii, recreation and conditions of living&quot;of workers in cr about coal mines and with mining education&quot;and research,  as the Board of Trade, after consultation with&quot;any Government Departments concerned, may approve&quot;.     The Fund is derived from a levy of a penny a ton on theannual output of all coal minest together with a special levyof a shilling in the pound on coal mining royaltieso  (ThisIstter levy was instituted in       and its proceeds areearmarked for s special purpose - viz, pithead baths).     The allocation of the fund i3 in the hands of theMiners&apos; Welfare Committee, which consists of three nomineesof the Miners&apos;  Federation, two of the Mining Association, oneof the Royalty Owners, and tv;o independent members, under thechairmanship of Lcrd Noel-Buxton.     The Royalty Levy referred to above is a permanentimpesltion, but the penny per ton levy, from which the mainpart of the Miners&apos; Welfare Fund is &quot;derived, was originallylimited in its duration to a period of 5-  years - viz. to theend of 1925.   This period was extended for another 6 years bythe Mining Incvst-vy (Welfare Fund) Act of 1925, and again for years by the Act of 1951.     Up to the end of 1932, the total amount collected,including interest, was upwards of  13,000,000, of which lessthan  1?000?000 remained unaJlocated.   The levy in respect ofthe output of the year 1932 is; uuder the existing law, due for payment on the 31st March next,,
     During the passage of tho Bill of 1931 there was considerable criticism in Parliament of the proposal toextend the penny levy for a further five years, it beingrepresented that the financial condition of the industrydid not justify it, and also that the main objects of thefund had already been achieved.   As a result, during theCommittee stage of the Bill, the then Secretary for Mines(Mr. Shinwell) undertook to set up an independent Committeeto enquire generally into the scope and work of the Miners&apos;Welfare Fund, and to make recommendations, with special reference to the amount and duration of the levy for thefuture.   This Committee was constituted as follows:-                  Viscount Chelmsford (Chairman)                  Lord Srskine, M.P. ,                  Mr. Gordon Mscdonald, M.P.,                  Mr. Geoffrey Mander, M.P.,                  Mr. H.B. Allen,                  Mr. Alfred Smith.     The Committee has now presented its Report (Cmd*4236,1933).   The report is signed by four out of the six members(one subject to reservations), and the two remaining members(representing the Mining Association and the miners federation respectively) have each presented a minority repo.rta     The Committee make a number of detailed recommendations in regard to the allocation of the fund, and itsadministrative machinery, and these I have, as a first step,referred to the Miners&apos; Welfare Committee for their observations.   Most of them are more or less &quot;domestic&quot;matters, and not of  immediate urgency.     But the Committee make three  specific recommendations for  amendment of the existing law.    (1) The most important and urgent of these is thereoommendation  that  the penny levy should be reduced to ahalfpenny, that the  reduction should take effect at onoe -
i.e., in respect of the 1958 output levy, due on 31st march next - and that the new halfpenny levy should be imposed fora period of 20 years;  but that,  if and when the financialstate of the industry permits,  the amount should beincreased.       ^This recommendation is  signed by Lord Ghelmsford,   Lord Erskine and Mr. Mander.    Mr. Gordon Macdonald   recommends the continuation  of the one penny levy.   Mr. A. Smith recommends the  continuation of the one penny   levy if pensions are brought within the scope of the Fund;   otherwise he is content with one halfpenny.       Mr. H.E. Allen recommends the reduction of the levy   to one-fifth of a penny for  five years,  followed by a   further reduction to one-eighth/.   (2)  The second recommendation concerns the provision inthe 1920 Act which requires the Miners&apos; 7/elfare Committee to allocate four-fifths of the amount collected from each district for the benefit of that district.    The InquiryCommittee consider that this limiting requirement should beremoved, so that the Welfare Committee shall have completediscretion in allocating the fund according to the needs ofthe coalfield as a whole.       $his recommendation is  concurred in by   Lord Chelmsford, Lord Erskine, Mr. Mander and Mr. Allen.   Mr. Gordon Macdonald does not agree, in view of his   recommendation that the penny levy be continued, and   Mr. A. Smith also recommends that the present arrange-   ment should continue/.   (3)  The third of these recommendations aims at clarifyingthe existing legal definition of the scope of the Fund.       /This recommendation is  concurred in by all members   of the Committee, Mr. Gordon Macdonald and Mr. A.Smith   consider that the definition should be extended to cover   the provision of pensions/.     The recommendation of a reduction of the levy to ahalfpenny, and its extension to 20 years is the mostimportant finding, arrived at as the result of a very full and careful survey of the history of the Miners&apos; Welfare Fund.
0 oO 0   I have no hesitation in agreeing with this recommendation,   in the light &quot;both of the work already acoomplished by the   Fundv and also of the present financial condition of the   industry.   A halfpenny levy for a further period of 20 years,   properly administered, should ensure continuous and   adequate progress of the Pund:B work, without undue call   upon the finances of the Industry.        It seems clear that, with the present and impending   oalls upon the time of Parliament, it will not be possible   to pass the necessary legislation for some time.    In the   circumstances, therefore, I ask for Cabinet authority to   make an announcement to the effect that the Government   agrees generally with the above findings of the Inquiry   Committee, and that as soon as Parliamentary business permits,   legislation will be introduced, which will include a   provision for the reduction of the output levy to a half-   penny, commencing (retrospectively) with the levy for 1932*,   and for its extension for a period of 20 years.        In the meantime, as I have already stated, I propose to   ascertain the views of the Miners1 Welfare Committee upon   the administrative recommendations, and to consider to what   extent, if any, provision will have to be made in the Bill   for these and other details.   But it is essential that an   announcement of Government policy regarding the reduction of   the output levy as from 1932 should be made at once.Mines Department,   16th February, 1933.It is true that delay in passing the Bill  will leave  the  1932  levy legally payable on the 31st March at the  penny rate.   But  this delay appears to be unavoidable, and all  that can be done is simply to accept a halfpenny levy on account, pending the passing of the Bill.
