IS  DOCUMENT  IS THE  PROPERTY  OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S  GOVERNMENT .  Z 0 3 CRET                                             Copy  No.....T.......,P.92(33) ,                 CABINET .            LOCAL  GOVERNMENT AND  OTHER  OFFICERS          (SUPERANNUATION  PROVISIONS AMENDMENT) BILL.            memorandum by the Minister  of Health.                 In October  last I circulated  to rny colleagues  a      memorandum (H.A.32(32)) suggesting that a Bill should be      introduced on tho subject of the   superannuation  rights of  local      government officers whose salaries had  been temporarily  reduoed      in  consequence  of the finanoial situation.   This memorandum      was considered  in Cabinet on the  16th November (Cabinet      Conclusion 61(32) 5)  and it was then agreed that the  subject      should be  taken off the Agenda Paper in order that  certain points      might be further discussed  between the  President of  the  Board  of      Education  and myself.  Further discussion has now  taken place      and it has been agreed between us that  the scope of  the  Bill      should be  limited to  those  cases  of reduction in salary  where it      was agreed by the Local Authority that  superannuation allowances      should not be affected, provided  always that the agreement was      entered into during the period 30th september, 1931,  to      1st April, 1932.   Tho principal  Associations of Local Authorities      concerned  have  been consulted and, while certain of  them press      for the wider measure originally  contemplated, none  expresses  any       opposition to the limited proposal.   It may, however, be  necessary      at  a  later stage to resist  amendments designed to widen  the scope      of  the  Bill.                 I  propose now to  submit a Bill  on the  above lines to      the home Affairs Committee  3 0 that if approved it may be      Introduced as quickly as possible.                                 (Intld.) E.H.Y.6th April,  1933.
