Instruction.                I.-INTRODUCTION.    ON the 8th March, 1933, the Prime Minister gave instructions that a report should be prepared showing         (1) The position of the private armaments industry in our system of               Imperial  Defence.        (2) The position to-day compared with pre-war times.        (3) How far the industry is dependent on foreign orders.        (4) The position of foreign armaments industries.    We have considered the above  questions, and have submitted a  Report onItem  4, prepared by the Sub-Committee on Industrial Intelligence  in ForeignCountries, regarding the  position of foreign armaments industries (C.I.D. PaperNo. 1106-B).*  We have  examined the situation, and now present the following report dealing with instructions (1), (2) and (3).    2.  No one could exaggerate what we suffered in the first half of the late war for want of munitions. It prolonged the war for years, and we are paying for itto-day.  It is the duty of the Principal Supply  Officers Organisation  to prepare plans so as to ensure that  a similar deficiency does not occur again.    The dependence of  our Defence Departments on the private  armaments industry, and the acute difficulties that are likely to arise in the event of emei-gencyowing to its decline since  the late war, has recently been a subject of concern to us.In our Eighth Annual Report for the year 1930-31 (Paper No. C.I.D. 1076-B,paragraph 4), we first drew attention to this subject, and made the following observations :         &quot; In the case of armaments and munitions,  an immense  quantity of    which would be required in the event of war, and  for which only limited    manufacturing  capacity exists in peace time, the problem is of peculiar    magnitude  and difficulty.   It must be recollected that the position to-day    differs materially from that obtaining in 1914; in the latter year there were    several armament firms in  existence, who had not only the manufacturing    capacity, but also the technical knowledge and trained personnel necessary    for an increased  output of munitions  in emergency.   To-day there is    practically  only  one armament  firm in  England  which  undertakes the    manufacture  of  the heavier types of munitions, and its expansion capacity    is progressively reduced, as peace-time orders  for munitions continue to fall    off.                           * Also Paper No. P.S.O. :JU:S.

I. THE POSITION OF THE PRIVATE ARMAMENTS INDUSTRY IN OUR SYSTEM OF                            IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.    3.  In order to assess the dependence of our system of Imperial Defence onthe private armaments industry we have ascertained the following facts from theDefence Departments: Naval.    4.  The Admiralty rely chiefly upon private firms, not only for shipbuilding,but equally for armaments.  Apart from dockyard built ships, only a few special requierements,  such as torpedoes and cordite, are manufactured to any extent  inGovernment establishments.  To a  lesser  degree  transferable  gun mountings,fUzes and certain shell and ammunition  components are obtained from the royal ordnance Factories,  but other navajl requirements, such as non-transferable gun mountings, hardened shell, armour, &amp;c, and the bulk of the ships and transferablemountings, guns, &amp;c, are obtained from private manufacturers.  Engines andair vessel forgings for torpedoes are also obtained from the trade.  A statement showing the  estimated percentage  of the dependence  of  the Naval  Service  on private firms in  war is attached (Appendix A).Army.     5.  The War Office obtain many of their peace  requirements from the royal ordnance Factories.   They therefore rely to a lesser extent than the Admiralty on civil firms for  their normal peace-time needs.  It is, however, their custom to place orders of a developmental or experimental nature with such civil firms as maintainthe necessary plant and technical staffs.  Private firms undertake such orders, not* Italics not in the original.   In our Ninth Annual Report for the year 1931-32 (Paper No. C.I.D; 1104-B,paragraph 20) we  again bring this question to the particular attention  of theJommittee of Imperial Defence in the following words :         &quot; In our last Annual Report, paragraph 4, we drew attention to the fact   that, whereas  in  1914  there were in existence several armament firms who   possessed  not only  the  manufacturing capacity,  but  also the technical   knowledge and  trained  personnel  necessary  for  an increased output  of   munitions in an  emergency, there is to-day practically  only one armament   firm in England  which undertakes the manufacture of  the  heavier type  of   munitions.  It has been observed, moreover, that in the case of almost every   factory visited other than those  of regular armament firms,  such as Vickers   Armstrongs the machines and plant installed during the late war for the   production of munitions have now been scrapped.        &quot; The investigations made during the year by the Supply Committee   dealing with  shipbuilding also  show  contraction in this sphere of our   production capacity-   A number  of yards have been dismantled and others   are likely to be closed down.  Although the decline in naval orders, both  on   home and foreign accounts, partly accounts for this, the world depression   and the consequent  slump in international  trade  is no doubt  the greatest   factor in the situation.  In the  last year or two strong efforts have been made   to rationalise the industry, and  the more efficient and compact industry which   should result  from these  steps may be expected to counterbalance to some   extent the diminution  in the number of actual building yards.        &quot; Certain foreign countries give assistance to their armament firms,   e.g., by the granting of export credit facilities, but we recognise  that this   matter involves political considerations, and is accordingly outside  the scope   of this Committee.  We  do, however, consider it  our duty to  bring to the   notice of the Committee of Imperial Defence  the serious decline  in our   armaments  and  shipbuilding  industries  as  compared  with the  situation   existing in  1914, and  the extent to which our ability to take measures for   defence is thereby impaired.&quot;*
only in order to keep their plant engaged, but in the hope of securing orders from foreign countries for similar types or articles.  It is in the early stages of war.always the most critical time, that the Army look to the armament firms to supplytheir war requirements.   The enormous and varied demands of the Army  forwarlike stores of all sorts that would  arise can only be met by transformingfactories,  which in peace produce goods of a commercial type, into munition factories.  This  takes time, and it may not always happen, as in the late war,that we shall have an ally who is prepared to stand the brunt of  the fighting formany months running into years until we are in a position to develop  our full strength.  To tide over this critical period three sources of supply are open :      (a)  War Reserves         It is obviously impossible to maintain  reserves  of the size that would     be required  in  an  emergency.     (b)  Production from Government Factories         This is  strictly limited and it is financially impossible to maintain these     factories in a state of readiness that would enable them  to approach     Eroductive  capacity  of the order required in war time until many months      ave elapsed.     (c)  Production from armament firms         This remains our only hope of extra capacity which can be maintained     in peace and be available in war on a business footing.     The existence of an armaments industry capable of expanding its peaceproduction to meet the war demands  of our land forces  is therefore  of vitalimportance.A ir.     6.  The Air Ministry have no manufacturing resources whatever,  and  are entirely dependent on the various private firms in this country,  except for sucharmament as is manufactured for them by the Royal Ordnance Factories or  theNaval Torpedo  Factory.  In  the event of a major war the expansion of the AirForce would certainly have to be more rapid, and possibly greater in proportion.than that of either of the other two Services.   It is therefore obviously of vitalimportance that the industries from which aircraft and other technical equip-ment are derived should not only be healthy and flourishing, but  should in peacetime be organised on the  broadest  possible  basis.  The Air Ministry  arecontinuously working to foster this essential condition,  and  nothing has been more encouraging than the steady  increase of  foreign orders as the result ofthe strenuous co-operation of firms  and the State Departments concerned.   Itwould be lamentable if this development were checked or wasted.  The  problemof expansion, difficult  in itself, is being brought nearer to solution chiefly  bythe progressive establishment of a steady peace-time market complementary tothe  requirements of the Air Force, which necessarily fluctuate m  accordancewith the demands of operational policy.Conclusion.     7.  Apart from a  general reference in the extract from our Ninth  annual report, given in paragraph 2, we have made no reference to the general declinein the  shipbuilding industry and  the reduced  capacity of our shipyards  toconstruct merchant vessels.  From the experience in  the late war and our heavy losses due to the submarine campaign this matter should  not be lost sight of, as our  inability to  replace merchant snips lost at  sea might well  prove the fatalfactor in any future contingency.     Our general conclusion is that a stable shipbuilding and armaments industry,which maintains an adequate output of naval craft and warlike stores as part ofits  normal peace-time  programme, is an essential  element  in  our scheme  ofImperial Defence.[8376]
    II. POSITION  OF THE PRIVATE ARMAMENTS INDUSTRY COMPARED WITH                             PRE-WAR TIMES.General Considerations.    8.  It is difficult to assess the extent of the decline in our naval shipbuilding and armaments  industries since 1914.   The present-day  requirements of theDefence Departments are more varied and specialised  than they were in  1914.There are now many types of scientific and mechanical stores, such as the Vickerspredictor, which are made by the trade alone and which the Royal Factories donot at present  manufacture.    In the event of emergency greatly increasedquantities of stores, both in numbers and in types, will be required, as comparedwith  the requirements in 1914,  when  the extent of  a world war had not beenenvisaged.  Though no hard and fast comparison is possible, the following facts are not without significance.Naval Shipbuilding.    9.  At the beginning of August 1914  there were building or ordered in theUnited Kingdom on British  or  foreign account, no  less than 111 warships ofdifferent categories; 22, about one-fifth, of these being for foreign countries.  Outof 21  capital ships under construction  4 were on foreign account.    In August 1930 there were 38 ships  on order, of which only one, a smallvessel, was for foreign account.  These included no capital ships.  At the sametime some 19 warships and four coastal motor boats  were under construction  in italian shipyards for other countries.    The  situation has  recently  improved owing to an  order placed by thePortuguese  Government.   This  order,   which  is  for  four  sloops,   three destroyers and three submarines, was originally placed in Italy.  Owing mainly to our departure from the gold  standard  the Portuguese  Government has beeninduced to transfer this order to British shipyards.  These vessels, and a trainingship  for the Brazilian navy, are the sole  naval work  now in  hand in Britishshipyards on foreign account.    It is noteworthy that in 1932 some thirteen warships (including two cruisersfor the Argentine) were completed in Italian shipyards for other countries, while some  sixteen fighting vessels (submarines,  destroyers and small craft) are nowunder construction in that country for other foreign  Powers.Armament Firms.    10.  In 1914 there were several armament firms  in existence in this country which undertook the manufacture of munitions of war.  As mentioned  in theextracts from our previous reports given in paragraph 2, there is now practicallyonly one firm in Great Britain which is capable of undertaking  the manufactureof the heavier type of munitions.  Moreover, this firm, Messrs. Vickers Armstrongs,has greatly reduced its capacity and has closed several of its works.  Certain firms have  successfully turned over their works from the production  of the spears  ofAvar into the manufacture of the ploughshares of peace.   Some have ceased  to exist.    In 1914 in addition to Vickers, the  following eleven firms existed;  the presentsituation of these is also given :             1914.

In liquidation.  Works closed.  No longer do gun forgings.
    11.  Though the number of  firms  who manufacture war-like stores  hasdiminished, allowance must be made for the fact  that Vickers-Armstrong haveabsorbed several  firms,  while Imperial  Chemical Industries, Ltd., have done the same thing in the explosives industry.  &quot;While these amalgamations may haveadvantages  from the  commercial  point  of  view,  it  is a  definite  factthat  most  of the shops  of the  absorbed  firms  have been closed down andare incapable of undertaking  production  of  our  war requirements  withoutinordinate  delay.  In another connection we have recently received communica-tions from  both Messrs. Vickers-Armstrongs and Imperial  Chemical Industries,pointing out their inability to maintain plant and  technical staff for the produc-tion of armaments and  propellants unless further orders, either Government orfrom other sources, are  forthcoming.    The following is an extract from a communication recently received from theformer firm :          &quot; The British Government often asks Vickers:  &apos; What can you produce,    and in what time, in  the event of war ? &apos;  The answer to this question must    be a constantly diminishing quantity unless a steady  flow  of work can be    maintained in the factories.  Large technical staffs cannot be  kept in idleness,    and the upkeep of  empty, or  practically empty, factories is heavy.   Orders    which  Vickers have  passed owing  to  restrictions have undoubtedly been    placed abroad, and Britain is poorer in consequence,  her national defence    has suffered,  and her ability  to secure commercial and armament trade abroad    weakened.&quot;    This statement confirms the conclusion at which we had already  arrived.that at present we are definitely  worse off now than we were in 1914 with regardto the  amount of help which we may expect to obtain from the civil armament industry during  the early  and critical stages of a major wrar.Reasons for decline.    12.  Apart  from the general depression in  the heavy industries that  hasexisted since the  war, there are  several direct reasons for this decline.  Briefly..they may be summarised as  follows :      (a) Reduced strength of our Defence Forces.         The Treaties of Washington and London fixed the strength of our naval    forces  for a  period of years, thus  causing very  reduced requirements.  The    strength of the army  has also  been reduced to well below its pre-war figure;    consequently requirements are also less.    (b) Existence of large War. stocks.         The War Office have large stocks of war-time ammunition and arms on    their hands, which are being  used up but not replenished,  except in a  few    instances.    (c) Lack of Foreign Orders.         Foreign orders for ships  and armaments, which prior  to 1914 came to    this country, are no longer received to anything like the same extent owing    to foreign competition  which is often State-aided.   Purchasing  countries    place orders in the cheapest market or where political considerations are a    governing factor.   Consequently, those foreign firms who receive Government    assistance, either financial or  otherwise, are in a stronger position to obtain    such orders as are  available.    (d) Restriction and consequent uncertainty.         It is clear that the uncertainty of delivery  by this country has alarmed    foreign customers.  In 1914 His Majesty&apos;s Government took  over the war-    ships then building in this  country on behalf of Turkey, Chile and Brazil.    This action, legal  though it  was, has not encouraged would-be customers,    though in an emergency other Governments would  hardly  refrain from    similar action.     There is also no doubt that the existence of an effective control over the exportof arms, and the fear that an embargo  on export may be placed by His Majesty&apos;s       [837G]                                                    B  3
Government at a time when they are most required, has led foreign&apos;governments to place their orders elsewhere.  Attention is drawn to the fact that an order onceplaced in a foreign country is most difficult to recapture, as subsequent orders,both for new material and for  spare parts, usually adhere to the original type.    We have appointed a special sub-committee to consider whether the existingExport Licence Regulations can be modified, having regard to the interests of thefighting  services  and  the competitive position  of  United Kingdom  firms  inobtaining orders from foreign countries.Results of this decline.    13.  It is evident that  the  loss of orders has hit the armament firms veryhard.  It has resulted in the closing down of shops and  yards, and consequentloss of employment.  Owing to the reduction in  productive capacity, the ability of this country to construct warships and to make munitions for the purposes ofits defence is thereby  gravely  prejudiced.  A - further,  and  perhaps moredisquieting, feature is the dispersal of the necessary technical staff employed inthe shipbuilding industry and in the manufacture of special war products, which require a very high degree of skilled labour. A somewhat forcible illustration ofthis is the delay that occurred  in the construction of the gun mountings of thetwo  post-war battleships, ELM.  Ships  Rodney and  Nelson,  which  was dueappreciably to the lack of experienced workmen  and  design staff.   -In thisconnection it has been brought to our notice that&apos;the Darlington Forge Company,a firm which up till recently was engaged on the manufacture of castings andforgings  required for  the  new Cunarder under  construction,  had  to recallpensioned  employees  in order to instruct the  younger  generation on certainconstructive operations requiring a high  degree of skill.   Their works  have nowbeen closed.Values of Earports, 1907 and 1930.    14.  The Census of Production taken in respect of the years 1907  and 1930enables some very rough comparisons  to be made between the  pre-war and thepresent position.  The comparisons relate to arms and  ammunition, excludingships and aircraft, but including sporting guns  and ammunition and fuses andother explosives not  necessarily for  military use.   In  1907  the value of theproduction  by private firms  was   8,014,000 and  in  1930 about   7,420,000.Though the actual value of the figures shows no great decrease, the difference invalues reigning in 1907 and 1930 means a very appreciable reduction in quantitywhich  is estimated as  at  least  40  per  cent.   Of  the above amounts,  some33 per cent, was  exported  in  1907 and 48 per cent, in 1930,  indicating theincreased dependence of the reduced industry on its export trade.  A great partof the  exports in each  year went to  British countries,  but the  proportion toforeign countries increased from 43 per cent, iii 1907 to 48 per  cent, in 1930.In considering these figures it will be recalled  that the  strength of the armed forces of the Crown,  and consequently  of their requirements, have  decreasedappreciably since 1907.Conclusion.     15.  From the above information it  is evident to us that the armaments and naval shipbuilding industries  in this country  are  both dwindling industries.Their present state, not only as regards the number of firms, shops and yards, butas regards their normal output, as well ds their powers of expansion,  is greatlyinferior to that prevailing in 1914.  III. THE  EXTENT TO WHICH THE ARMAMENTS  INDUSTRY IS DEPENDENT ON                             FOREIGN ORDERS.Pre-war and present situations.    16.  Foreign orders have always played an important part in our armaments and shipbuilding industries.  We have pointed  out in paragraph 9 that in 1914about  one-fifth  of  the  naval construction  then  being undertaken  in Britishshipyards was for foreign account, and that this included orders  for four capital ships, costing many millions of pounds.  The money thus received was nearly all
spent in this country and must have gone some distance to pay for the overheadcharges, not only of the armament firms, but of all the ancillary firms with whom they placed orders, whether for raw materials and its transport or for machinery,^ttings and equipment.   A recent  statement  in  the House of Commons to theeffect that some SO per cent, of the  money spent on shipbuilding in this  countrywent in wages indicates the importance of this and may explain the public  interestin the construction of the new Cunarder.   These orders have,  since the war,declined to next to nothing.  A small  but  welcome fillip  to  this industry has,however, recently been received by the order by the Portuguese Government forcertain small naval craft,  referred to in  paragraph 9.    It  is difficult to compare the foreign orders for laud armaments received inthis country prior to 1914 with those received since the war.  In pre-war daysit was mainly guns and ammunition that were exported, whereas, since the war,it is special equipment of a highly technical nature, such as tanks and heavymachine guns, that form the bulk of our orders.   It will be seen from the detailsgiven in paragraph  14 that our armaments industry is to an increasing extentdependent on foreign orders, particularly in view of the reduced demands on homeaccount.  Those foreign orders are. however, decreasing in quantity, and it willbe gathered from our Report (C.I.D. Paper No. 1106-B)*  that many orders forland armaments, which were formerly placed in Great Britain,  are now beingsecured by our foreign competitors.    The aircraft industry in Great  Britain,  which is  of  comparatively recentorigin,  presents a  less  gloomy  picture.  Since  1925  an  export trade in aircraft and aeronautical material has grown up.  This has stimulated the british aircraft industry and has led to increased orders and employment.  Spread overthe five year period,  1926-31, the proportion of aircraft, aero-engines and spare parts exported, represents about one-sixth of  the total manufacture. A substantialsum of foreign money thus finds its way into British pockets and  goes some way towards carrying the overhead costs of the aircraft industry, enabling firms notonly to cheapen their prices, but to carry out work of a developmental and experi-mental nature.  There is no doubt that the loss of  these  foreign orders would react disastrously on the aircraft firms, some of whom would slacken off and thusreduce their capacity, while others would definitely go out of business.  This would seriously endanger  the  industrial  nucleus regarded  as  essential for rapid expansion in time of emergency.  A further important factor in this connectionis the  value of technical  information regarding  developments abroad, which isat present obtained by aircraft  production firms through association with foreignindustry in the carrying out of foreign orders.Commercial aspect.    17.   The reluctance  of foreign customers  to  place  orders with  Britisharmament firms, owing to the uncertainty regarding the possibility of obtainingdelivery, has another, and purely commercial, effect.  Negotiations are at presentin progress under the auspices of  the  Department of Overseas  Trade betweenthe industries of the United  Kingdom upon  the one hand, and, on the other,groups of consumers in certain foreign countries. The primary  object of these is to dispel as a precursor to more formal tariff negotiations all  uncertainty inthe mind of the foreign buyer that the United Kingdom is in a position to  provide them with goods adequate in quantity and quality to their needs.  Many classesof  such goods,  such as steel-hardening materials and  jute bags,  though nottechnically munitions of war, are undoubtedly bought for such uses.  If, therefore,uncertainty exists in the mind of the buyer about the possibility of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment suddenly curtailing supplies, the effect is felt over  a much wider range  of commodities than those actually appearing on the present list of exportprohibited goods.Conclusion.     18.  It is clear to us that no great Power can maintain private armament firms with adequate potential war  capacity without the  assistance of  foreignorders or the grant of subsidies on a large scale, or possibly a combination  of both.Though we are unable to give any  specific figures,  the following comparisonindicates the extent to which the private armaments industry in  this country is dependent on  foreign orders.                            * Also Paper No. P.S.O. 303.
    The figures for 1914 show that approximately one-fifth of the warship con-struction in this country, representing a value of many millions, was on foreignaccount.   In 1930 such orders were insignificant..    The figures for the five years 1926-31 show that approximately one-sixth ofthe aircraft construction in this country was for foreign account.  If it were not for these foreign orders, it would be impossible to maintain the aircraft industry at it? existing strength.                               CONCLUSIONS.    Our Conclusions may be summarised as follows:       (i)  We have pointed out that it is on our armaments industry that we must           rely to bridge the gap between the outbreak of war and the time when           peace  industry can  be turned over to war production.    A  stable           armaments industry,  which maintains an adequate  output  of naval           craft and war-like stores as part of its normal peace-time activities, is           essential to our scheme of Imperial defence.     (ii)  The  present-day  capacities of  the  armaments  and  shipbuilding           industries are markedly inferior to those existing in  1914.    (iii)  In view of the reduced demands of the Home Government, it is clear that           if the armaments and shipbuilding industries are to have an adequate           potential capacity for production in war, they must be able  to. obtain           a steady supply of foreign orders, which, except perhaps in the case           of the aircraft industry, is not now forthcoming on a sufficient scale.

              POSITION  OF  FOREIGN  ARMAMENTS  INDUSTRIES.   Reportby&apos;Sub-Committee on Industrial Intelligence  in Foreign Countries^1.  Introduction.    In January 1931,  the  General  Staff (War Office)  prepared a Note on theexisting situation as regards competition between British and foreign armament firms  for  the exportation of war  materials.   It describes four  firms,  viz.:Schneider of France, Skoda of Czecho-Slovakia, Bofors of Sweden and Ansaldo ofItaly as the most important foreign manufacturers and exporters  of war material.    This statement still holds good,  but the existence of a large  number of other firms must be  recognised.   Admittedly of lesser  individual importance,  they,nevertheless, play a big part in the  International Armament Trade.    A further important development is the recognition by foreign countries ofthe immense disparity between the demand for Armaments in peace  and in war,with the result that even minor Powers are endeavouring to establish within theirown frontiers  an  Armament  Industry capable of  rapidly  supplementing in emergency the  comparatively meagre output capacity of Governmental Arsenals.    Since no State can keep such private armament firms occupied  in peace on home Defence, they  must largely depend for their existence on foreign orders.The general tendency,  therefore, is  for the State to encourage the obtaining ofsuch orders by subsidies, by the remission of import duties on raw materials and plant required for the  production of armaments by imposing import duties on articles likely  to compete with the  products of armament firms, by long-termloans  and even by the  direct soliciting of orders from  foreign  countries in thecourse  of diplomatic and trade negotiations.    In the following paragraphs, therefore, a brief examination is made of thesituation as regards  the manufacture of war material  in certain other foreigncountries as well as in France, Czecho-Slovakia, Sweden and Italy.    In every case it can be said that  countries have made great efforts to  build upa strong chemical industry for reasons of national defence.2.  Germany.    The  fact that Germany  is limited tinder the  Peace Treaty  regarding themanufacture of arms, has acted as a  stimulant to the planning of ways and means to obtain the munitions of war to meet an emergency.    German Armament Firms have entered into an understanding  with manu-facturers in certain foreign countries, notably Sweden, Holland,  Switzerland and spain.   There  is a  constant interchange  of technical  information.   Semi-manufactured goods and parts of munitions are produced in Germany for  assemblyabroad.    The  Reichsverband der Deutschen Industrie,  an organisation set  up as acorporate control for the whole of German industry, actively solicits orders for those types of munitions and munition-making machinery which  are pennittedunder the Peace Treaty and places  them with selected  firms, thereby forming acadre of  trained munition engineers and workmen. In addition,  many Germanengineers have been concerned in the ereqtion and working of munition  factoriesof all kinds in the U.S.S.R.    All  German aircraft  firms are indirectly controlled by  the Government.Although Germany is not permitted to  possess military  aircraft, the  government control is sufficient to ensure that types manufactured conform to  possible military requirements.   Subsidies are  granted  and certain private owners  given  state assistance to purchase  aircraft.   Some 40 to 45 per cent, of aircraft producedwere exported in 1929  and 1930.3. Sweden  and Norway.    Bofors Ordnance Works is one of the largest in the world.  It depends almostentirely on foreign orders.  A considerable portion of the shares are believed to beheld by Germans though nominally  in Swedish hands.    There  is no evidence that the Swedish Government  gives direct assistance tothis firm.  In  fact, it  seems certain that the firm has at times  rendered falsereturns of  the countries for which their goods are destined in order  to  avoidpossible Government embarrassment.
    Considerable exports have been made to Russia. Persia, Turkey and othercountries.   For instance, in 1931, 30 batteries of artillery were manufactured tothe order of Turkey.    Owing to its geographical position,  Bofors is  a  strong competitor in themanufacture of arms for the Defence Forces of the  Baltic States.    There is no doubt secret plans exist whereby Bofors would attempt to supplyGermany rapidly with heavy guns and other forbidden armament stores in war.    Though Norway  depends on Bofprs  fpr  its principal  requirements  of amilitary nature, firms exist in. the country  manufacturing munitions of various kinds,   In 1931 Persia negotiated for the purchase of 10 million rounds ofsmall arm  ammunition to be manufactured in Norway, though an order for a lesser quantity was actually placed.  It was stated that this order had for its object  the accustoming of the firm concerned to the manufacture of the type ofammunition required with a view to future orders.    The aircraft industry  in Norway is under State control and manufacturessplely for the Government, but there are four factories in Sweden, two of whichare  German-owned  and   manufacture  military   aircraft  from  componentsexported from Germany.   These aircraft are in turn exported abroad.4.  Denmark.    Until recently the Danish Government held  decided pacifist views and  tooksteps to discourage the creation of an Armament Industry.  In consequence, theDanske Rekylriffel  Syndikat arranged for the manufacture  of their productsabroad, in  those countries who were only too willing to manufacture arms withtheir own plant under licence.    In September 1932, however,  a large order for machine guns and  otherweapons  was placed with  the Danske Rekylriffel Syndikat by Brazil; as a resultof which the Danish Foreign Minister privately let it be known that this order and future orders for munitions of Danish origin would not be impeded by  him,ip  view of the  great unemployment in Denmark,  and the  fact  that no  other country had shown signs of stopping the production of armaments.5.  Holland.    Apart from the four State-controlled factories manufacturing  for  home consumption, munition works in Holland are in fact subsidiaries of German orAustrian firms set up after the war.    The firm of Siderius, which manufactures  guns  of large calibre, is in realitya subsidiary of  the  German firm, Rheinmetal.    The half-finished products and the essential special-purpose machinery from Ehrhardt  Ordnance Factory at dusseldorf were transferred  before peace was signed to store in Holland, under the care of this firm.    The Nederlandsche Patronen Fabriek was established in Dordrecht in  1924 by the Austrian firm Hirtenberg for the manufacture of small arm ammunition. Two other Dutch firms, formed about the same time, produce naval and military optical instruments, electrical searchlight,  fire-control apparatus.  &amp;c, under the control of  the German  firms of  Zeiss  and  Siemens  Schukert,  who  supply components from Germany.    All these  firms manufacture  for  export, but  are  apparently  not actjvelyassisted by the Dutch Government.    The Fokker Aircraft Works is well known and has an extensive export tradeupon which it relies for its continued existence.6.  Switzerland.    Though  there  are no  large-scale armament  works in Switzerland,  thoseexisting  are not tp  be disregarded.    They are almost, without exception, theproperty of  other  firstrclass Powers,  notably Germany.   Their products areregularly exported without hindrance from the Swiss Government.    The German Rifle Factory, Mauser, has a branch at Kreuzlingen in Switzer-land.   The Solothurn  Munition  Factory is  partly  owned  by the German Rheinmetal and partly by the  Austrian  Hirtenberg concern.    Apart from these, the Swiss firm, Schwob,  manufactures artillery fuzes in quantity for exporjb.       [8360]                                                     u 2

Theindustry is  State-controlled, and the Government  solicits orders from foreigncountries, distributing them to selected firms for  educational purposes.  Any firmobtaining an  order  for munitions receives&apos;, essential  raw  materials  for  theirmanufacture from abroad free of import duty.  In addition, very large subsidieshave been granted  to the shipbuilding and other industries of importance in war.    As in France, State factories are small as  compared with privately-ownedworks.  It is claimed by the Italians that the latter can employ at capacity about170,000 men, exclusive of the manufacture of explosives.    To supplement the output of civil and State works in war, a complicated planhas been worked out for the mobilisation of the whole  of the national industry for the production of war stores.    Italy has  an important aircraft  industry, supported and subsidised by theGovernment, in  addition to being fostered by considerable diplomatic assistancein the export  trade,  of which the recent commercial Treaties with the U.S.S.R.afford a good  example.  The Fascist Government exercises very strong controlover the whole industry, which it strives to maintain at  all costs.    All these firms are known to have supplied at least Russia, China, austria and Hungary with rifles, machine guns and other war stores.7.  Spain.    Apart from seven State-owned factories, several works exist connected withthe Armament Industry of other Powers.-  For instance,  Krupps control theMinas y Fabricas Mieres Steel Works manufacturing artillery transport; theGerman  Dye   Trust  controls  two  or  three   chemical  firms manufacturingexplosives, and the Hamburg firm of Stolzenberg has a subsidiary in Madrid forthe manufacture of poison  gas.    Vickers also have  an affiliated company in spain.8.  Austria.    Production of war material in Austria is restricted under  the Peace treaty to a single State Factory, which supplies the needs of the Army.    Certain firms are, however, connected financially and industrially with others in Switzerland and Holland openly manufacturing munitions.  Thus,  though they may not  directly export arms, they assist the latter in the production of semi-manufactured materials and parts destined eventually for export abroad.9.  Italy.    Fascist industrial  policy is aimed at  creating a  home armament industrycapable of satisfying the estimated requirements of a war of national effort.    Large orders for foreign warship construction have been obtained by Italy mainly at our expense in recent years.  For instance, in 1930 there were some19 warships and four coastal motor boats under construction in Italian ship-yards for other countries, whereas in Great Britain only one small war vessel was being built to foreign order.    The importance attached to the shipping and shipbuilding industry by theItalian  Government  is exemplified by the  grant  of  10.000,000  by way ofsubventions to these industries in the budget for 1931-32.    The most  striking development in Italian industry is the increased capacity for shipbuilding in the last ten years.   The following figures of  the gross tonnageof Merchant Vessels (of 100 tons gross and upwards) launched by certain of theprincipal  maritime countries, including Italy, will illustrate this : 
    The Armament Industry of Hungary is by no means negligible.  Althoughrestricted by the Treaty of Peace, and  the  import and export of arms areforbidden, there are now several private factories of considerable capacity.    The chief of these belong to the firm of Manfred Weiss; but a number ofother engineering works possess sections manufacturing armaments of various kinds, planned to turn over rapidly to the production of war stores in emergency,as a foundation of a scheme of National Mobilisation.    Both in planning and  technique, the Hungarians are assisted by Italianarmament firms and  by German experts.  Many new shops have been erectedsince  the war, and one is forced to reflect on the smallness of Hungary&apos;s lawfulrequirements as compared with the reckless extravagance which must have beenprevalent at any rate prior to 1928, when financial difficulties restricted further expansion.    Hungary  is not  allowed military aircraft under the Peace  Treaty, butconsiderable Government interest  is maintained in the output of the one smallState factory and the large privately-owned works of Manfred Weiss referred toabove.  It is significant that  Italy is understood recently to have  delivered toHungary a number of military aircraft.11. Bulgaria.    The principal Munition Factory in Bulgaria is the State Arsenal at Kazanlibwith a branch at Sofia. Apart from this, there are a number of explosive factoriesof relatively small capacity, and but few firms capable of manufacturing munitionsin peace.    Though not entitled to possess military aircraft there exists a small industrypartly controlled by Italian capital.12. France.    The existing capacity of the French Armament Industry  is probably thelargest in the world.    It is estimated from the number of men employed on arms  manufacture inpeace, that  the  value of the average  annual  output must lie in the region of 20 million.    In  addition, a State plan, worked out in  collaboration with the Comite desForges, exists for mobilization, which, if put into operation and given an adequate supply  of raw materials and skilled labour, would in a few months suffice tomaintain in the field a force of about 75 divisions, and later be capable of a still greater output if needed.    State Arsenals may not be large, but the civil munitions industry, practicallymonopolised by  Schneider-Oeusot, is of  considerable  magnitude and has vastramifications.   This  Concern dominates, in  addition, the armament industry of czechoslovakia,  Roumania, Yugoslavia and Poland.  It owns dockyards, factories,banks, railways, mines, metallurgical and chemical works, not only in France, butin many other countries, having ramifications  extending from South America to shangai.    The construction of warships on behalf of foreign countries is also under-taken.  In  1932 two destroyers and three  submarines were completed for thePolish Government.     The French aircraft industry, like the Armaments industry, is very large.  Itis entirely  in private hands, but there is naturally an important measure ofGovernment control by indirect means.  The export trade has of late been losingground, but is receiving considerable State assistance through propaganda spreadby means of military  missions to foreign countries,  diplomatic and militaryTreaties and financial pressure applied through foreign  State loans conditional on the purchase of French aircraft and material.13. Belgium.     The Belgian Armament Industry, which works in close touch with the French,is large compared with the size of the Belgian Defence Forces.   A considerableexport  trade is carried on.   While  there is no evidence that  this  is directlyencouraged, it is certainly not discouraged by  the State.                                     5
     In addition to four principal Government factories, there are over a dozen private firms known to be  producing between them arms  and munitions  of all kinds.     The  principal  export  from  Belgium  appears  to  be  small  arms and corresponding ammunition.   In the last  few months, several firms have been working overtime and  have  hired  new premises for the completion of foreign orders.   Recently orders from the Far East  have  naturally predominated, but shipments to South America, the U.S.S.R., Germany and Poland are known to have taken place as well.     The Bel belgian aircraft industry is very small and mainly builds aircraft under licence for the home market. 14. Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Roumania.     At present the central manufactory for  arms for the Little Entente is the Skoda Works and its affiliated factories in Czechoslovakia, in which the French firm, Schneider-CreusQt, has  a predominating interest.  Skoda, though a civil firm, apt as the principal Government Arsenal, and are considered to be large enough to supply  in  war,  not only the Czechoslovakian forces, but, to a large extent also, those of Yugoslavia and Roumapia.     Normally, in peace, the Skoda enterprises employ some 15,000 workmen, but they have recently commenced production in double shifts on orders for foreign countries.     The dividends paid by Skoda tell their own story, rising steadily from 5 per cent in 1920 to 28  per cent, in 1930.     There is evidence to show that Skoda and other Czechoslovakian Armament firms are assisted by the Government.  It is  a fact that they have suffered least in the present wave of industrial depression in Czechoslovakia.     Apart from foreign orders to the Little Entente, which may be excused by reason of a diplomatic Defensive Alliance, Skoda is known to have supplied arms to the Far East, South America, Turkey, the U.S.S.R, and other countries.     Czechoslovakia has built up, since the war, an aircraft industry capable not only of supplying home needs, but also of considerable export to the Baltic States, Turkey, &amp;c.  The  industry is mainly privately-owned, but receives considerable State assistance through Governmental orders and Service Demonstrations abroad.    In spite of  their agreed, and  at present inevitable, dependence on Skoda, Roumania and Yugoslavia are both making efforts to establish a State and CivilArmament Industry  in  their own country.   Lack of funds and political unresthave hitherto prevented the scheme from fully materialising, but in Roumania,at any  rate, eighteen factories, which in Januaiy 1932 employed some 18,000 men,are known to manufacture war stores in peace, while in Yugoslavia, the king and  his advisers  have for  some time had  under discussion  schemes to render the country less dependent upon external sources of supply.15. Poland.    The  French  firm Schneider  Creusot and its  Czech  associate Skoda,  are closely  connected with the Armament Industry of Poland.  In addition to a small number of State Arsenals at  Warsaw, Cracow and  Posen, there are at least sixfirms known to be regularly manufacturing  munitions in peace.    Export of arms from Poland is small,  and it is doubtful whether the home industry in  its present  state  could adequately supply with every type of arma-mpnt  the  Defence Forces if fully niobilised for  a  war  of national effort.Consequently, the Polish Government  is taking steps to encourage the expansionof the national industry, possibly the more so since recent political developmentsappear to render  less certain  the  material co-operation  in  emergency  of  theFrench, upon whom  the Poles have hitherto relied for an adequate supply  ofcertain munitions in war.    The  declared  policy of  the  Polish  Government  is to create  an aircraft industry to meet the demands of both civil and military aviation.   At present, itis able to  do this to the extent of about 60 per cent, of requirements.  It has,however,  recently  entered  the export market as a considered policy  for  thedevelopment of the industry.  Its  one State-owned factory  is known  to have accepted orders from  China and Russia.  Private industry is encouraged by aPresidential Decree of 1927, giving economic privileges and active support fromthe National Economic Bank.
     In U.S.S.R. there are no private firms, but the Soviet have modernised certain of the war-time arsenals,  in addition to  erecting new ones and installing plant and machinery  in civil works for the sole purpose of itslng this; capacity for war production.    The  creation of an Armaments  Industry of sufficient size  to meet the fullneeds of  the Red Armies&apos; potential mobilization capacity ig how taking shape.The military aspect of the First Five-Year Plan has proved successful, althoughthe comparative ill-success of certain  basic industries will at present preventthe armament factories from  achieving  the output for which  their plant and machinery is designed.    As regards export: apart  from  supplying Chinese  revolutionaries with considerable quantities of small arms  and  ammunition, the Soviet  Governmenthas exported both munitions and  machinery for their manufacture to turkey and  Persia,  including coast-defence artillery and ammunition.17. Japan.     Until recently  the Civil  Munitions Industry was not well developed  in japan.   The  manufacture of armaments was confined  to State Arsenals, whoseoutput  was  supplemented  by  purchase   from  abroad  through  a specificorganisation.    Under the stress of  recent  events  the Japanese aim  at becoming self-supporting in armaments  and may even  enter the export market before long.    Although the State Arsenals are not large by European standards, they  areequipped to turn out munitions of all kinds.   The Army o\vns 38 factories,the  Admiralty  12,   while  the Department  of  Trade  and  Industry  owns3 Metallurgical Works, of which  the  Yawata  Steel  Works,  having an annualcapacity  for about 1  million tons  of munition  steel,  is described as one of  the six principal steel works in the world.     The Japanese aircraft industry has  practically doubled its size since 1928,and is now in a  position to supply the country&apos;s present needs. There  is at present no export and the firms therefore depend on Government orders.  The industryis part and parcel of  the armaments industry, manufacture in almost every casebeing carried on by State  Arsenals and privately-owned armament  firms.18. United States of America.     In peace, the requirements of the Defence Forces of the United States ofAmerica in armaments are for the most part supplied by Government Arsenals,capable of supplying  at least three-quarters of current needs.   But in 1928  theChief of Ordnance  stated that the Government Arsenals, six  in  number, couldonly produce from a half  of 1  per cent, to  10  per cent, of  the total U.S.requirements for a major war.     In consequence, a civil armament industry is encouraged, to serve afe a basis for expansion.  At least 38 firms are known to produce munitions in peace.  their total output in  1929, including that of explosives, was valued at nearly 50 million dollars.  This has declined somewhat.     The output in war of those privately-owned firms, even when added to thatof the Government Arsenals, will only satisfy a small proportion of  the demand.The remainder  of war requirements planned to be met by the mobilisation of non-armament firms, are based on the estimated demand of an army of between 3 and4 million men.     There is no Government control of munition manufacture or of export. StateLaw appears to prohibit the institution  of Federal control, save  in war.  Thetotal value of armaments exported to foreign countries by the U.S.A. in 1932, isofficially  stated  to have been to the value of about 7 million dollars.     The aircraft and aero-engine industry of the U.S.A., which is entirely in private hands, is the largest in the world.&apos;  About one-tenth of the  total output was  exported in 1931.  Civil aviation  is subsidised by the Federal  Governmentand  Trade Commissioners spare no pains to push the sale of American aircraftwhenever the opportunity  occurs.   In addition,  the large  Federal  loans made to various South  American  countries have afforded  an opportunity  of  bringing
pressure to bear to ensure the sale of American aircraft against foreign eompeti-tion.  Other governmental influence can be traced in South America through     (a) the Guggenheim gift of  250,000 to Chilian aviation;    (b) the complete control of  Peruvian aviation  under an  American  Naval           Officer;    (c) the U.S. A. Naval mission to Brazil;    (d) State-subsidised air lines to various South American countries.                                 SUMMARY.    19.  The only country other than Great Britain in  which there is any evidence that the Armament Industry is apprehensive of governmental hindranceis Sweden.  In all other  cases the State more or less encourages it as a source ofrevenue, or else  more frequently,  directly  assists it  for  reasons  of NationalDefence.   - It can positively be stated  that in no foreign country, with the exception ofcertain of those defeated in the late war, has  the  capacity to manufacturemunitions been reduced, as compared with that existing in 1914. On the contrary,France, Italy and Russia have considerably extended their armament industries.Czechoslovakia, and  to  a lesser  extent Poland,  under French influence, have followed suit.   Germany, Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria have each, in theirrespective degree, planned to overcome the disabilities imposed upon them  by theTreaty of Versailles, not without the assistance of their late enemy, Italy.    Other minor Powers have  equally  taken steps to  ensure, in  so  far as theyare able, that the maximum industrial effort of the country shall  be available in emergency to manufacture the means of defence. A race to arms has been takingplace.  Nearly all countries have based their plans on the war of 1914, when hugeforces were engaged and colossal quantities of armament stores were expended.In order to maintain the industry so set up in a state of efficiency, orders aresought from  those countries whose armament &quot;industry is still, for one reason or another, in  a  comparatively backward state.   The keenest competition hasensued in the International Armament Trade.   Fearing or foreseeing futureeventualities  and prompted by motives of self-defence, the State has stepped into encourage and assist its national industry to outbid competitors.

(C.I.D. Papers Nos. 1106-B and 1109-B.)    THE COMMITTEE had under consideration  a  Report  (C.I.D. PaperNo. 1109-B) by the Principal Supply Officers Committee on the position of theprivate arms industry in the United Kingdom, showing the  decline  in the arma-ments industry since the late war and its serious effect on our preparations for national defence.    A note by the Chairman of the Principal Supply Officers Committee, covering a Report by  the Sub-Committee on Industrial Intelligence in Foreign Countries.on the position of foreign armaments  industries (C.I.D. Paper No.  1106-B) wasalso laid before the meeting.    THE PRIME  MINISTER said  that it  appeared from the Report of thePrincipal Supply Officers Committee that the situation was very serious.  It wouldbe necessary to see what could be done from an industrial point of view to assistthis industry.  He suggested that this matter should be taken out of  the hands ofthe Services  and considered from a civil and industrial aspect.    MR.  RUNCIMAN said  that  these papers  represented  the views  of  thePrincipal Supply Officers Committee.  The decline in our  armaments industryand the consequent shortage of capacity to produce war material in an emergencyhad been a cause of anxiety to that body for some considerable time. There was little doubt that the lack of foreign orders, a large  proportion of which wereformerly placed in this country, was one of the predominant causes.  Four reasonshad been alleged for the loss of these orders, which, it would be seen, now Aventto foreign countries.  These were :     (1) The export  licensing system, which induced uncertainty in the minds of          foreign buyers, who consequently refrained from placing orders:    (2) Lack of subsidies:    (3) Lack of credit  facilities;    (4) No diplomatic or political pressure is exerted on  foreign  countries to          place orders in the United Kingdom.    These explain to some extent, though not entirely,  the loss of foreign orders;as the result of which our private armament firms are now weaker than they havebeen for three generations.    SIR BOLTON EYRES-MONSELL stated that  the Admiralty viewed thesituation thus revealed with the greatest gravity.  He drew the attention of theCommittee to the table attached as an Appendix to  C.I.D. Paper  No. 1109-B..which  showed  the extent to which the  Admiralty depended on private firms.While  many firms in this country were either going  out of business or ceasing&apos;the manufacture of  arms, there appeared  to be a tremendous increase in  the armaments industries  in  other foreign  countries.   He considered that  theexistence of a  system  of export licensing  was the main  deterrent to  foreignpurchasers.  He also considered that  we nad been- internationally  hoodwinked,as this system was self-imposed  and its existence, though perhaps an example toother countries, had certainly frightened away possible purchasers.  The presentprosperity of Skoda and other continental firms  in contrast to our  own showed      [8441-1]   ^......________________________........_____.................
that while there were plenty of orders about the amount coming to this country was negligible.  He was very  glad to see that an  inter-departmental committeehad been set up to consider modifications to the existing Regulations for export licences, and suggested that the  terms of reference of this Committee should been larged to  enable it to examine the question of the extension of export credits to cover warships.   The Report showed  that our general shipbuilding capacitywas declining,  while that of Italy was increasing.  This country was formerlythe world&apos;s  supplier of warships,  but foreign countries now appeared  to placetheir orders in Italian yards.     THE PRIME MINISTER recognised  the need  for  some effective action being taken and  suggested that  an  inter-departmental committee should  be assembled to deal with this question from  a  civil point of view.     MR.  RUNCIMAN said that the inter-departmental committee appointed bythe Principal Supply Officers Committee was constituted for the specific purposeof  considering  the  question  of  export licences,  which did  not  involve  anylegislative action and was consequently not of a political nature.  The terms ofreference of this sub-committee were as follows:           &quot; To consider the present system of licensing exports of arms, ammuni-     tion and other materials, to which the Arms Export Prohibition Order, 1931,     applies, and  to report what modifications,  if any, are. in  their view,     desirable,  having regard to      (a) The interests of the Fighting Services; and     (6) The competitive position of United Kingdom  firms in  obtaining orders          from foreign countries.&quot;     SIR  JOHN SIMON  pointed out  that under a  Cabinet conclusion  -ofFebruary 1933  the British Delegation at the Disarmament Conference at Genevahad been  directed  to urge  the adoption by other foreign countries of a systemof export licensing similar to  the  one already in use in this country.  In orderto control the arms traffic effectively some international agreement was necessary.It was obvious that a  system of  international licensing  was  undesirable  and difficult to enforce.  The adoption of some system of export licensing similar toour  own  by other  countries appeared the  sole solution.  He fully realised  the argument that the  general adoption of these licences would not ensure their beingobserved  by unscrupulous Governments.     THE PRIME  MINISTER  understood that  the  French had a completesystem for  the  control  of  exports of arms, but in no  case had they  actuallyenforced any prohibition of export.  He suggested  that this matter should nolonger be considered purely from the view of the Defence Departments, but shouldbe  referred to the Cabinet  with a  view  to  the  appointment of an  inter-departmental committee.   The terms of reference of this committee should, hethought,  be drafted to cover the general  question.    In  the  meantime, our conversations  at Geneva could go on.   The revision of our  system of exportlicensing appeared to him to be all the more necessary  at the present time.   the inquiry need not  await the conclusion  of an  international agreement, as this might take some time.   The composition of the Committee could be settled  whenthe matter was referred to the Cabinet.                                 CONCLUSION.     THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed          to  refer the Report by  the Principal Supply Officers Committee on the         position of the private arms industry (C.I.D.  Paper  No. 1109-B) and         the memorandum on  foreign armaments  industries  (OLD.  Paper         Xo. 1106-B) to the Cabinet, with  a view to  an  examination of the whole         situation and  the appointment of an inter-departmental committee to         consider  what action  can be  taken  to  remedy  the  serious  situation         revealed.         ^4*           4fc            4fr         4^                      ^2j Whitehall Gardens, S.
