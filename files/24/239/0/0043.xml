My colleagues may be interested to read the attached description of the FarmRelief Bill, recently broadcast by the United states secretary for Agriculture.(Intld.)

                     U.S.A. FARM BILL.ADDRESS ON THcJ FARM BILL EY HENRY A.  WALLACE, SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE, MARCH 18, 12s46 P.K. , THROUGH THE NATIONAL  BROADCASTING COMPANY AND ITS ASSOCIATE STATIONS.     I am sure all of you wish to know as much as possible aboutthe farm bill which the President of the United States 3ent to congress Thursday afternoon with a special message.    First,however, let me tell you the story of how this bill  came into existence.     The farm problem, as you know, is very close to the heart andmind of President Roosevelt.   When he became President his first duty was to meet the banking crisis.   But as soon as he had net the  crushing emergency of that problem, hi3 mind turned to theagricultural situation, and as a result I sent out a hurry-up callto the leaders of agriculture to meet with me on Friday of lastweek.     At that meeting were men who had spent a lifetime in cotton,wheat, hogs, corn, dairying, etc.   Because of the necessity ofattending a Cabinet meeting, and for other reasons,  I was unableto sit with this group of farm leaders for more than a few minutes.Assistant Secretary Rex Tugwell, therefore, presided.     It seems that after extended debate the farm leaders reachedthe conclusion that no one plan of production control could serveall the major farm crops equally well.   A plan that might workwell with wheat, might not work so well with cotton.   The farmleaders realized, in a word, that different methods of productioncontrol would have to be used for different farm products.   they also realized that, as the plan went into effect for any crop,a method that had locked good on paper might not work out so wellin practice.   Accordingly, they wanted to give administratorsof the plan leeway to modify their methods whenever necessary.     Above all,  the farm leaders wanted something practical andthey wanted it quick.   They therefore recommended  that very broadpowers be conformed on the President and  the Secretary of
Agriculture to deal with the national emergency.   their recommendations, in general, were in line with the Topekaspeech made by President Roosevelt last fall.     The next step was to give these recommendations legalform.   Because of the Constitutional problems we found thisexceedingly difficult, and it was not until day beforeyesterday that we were sufficiently satisfied with the jobtr pass it on to the President,     In the meantine representatives of the packers, the millers, the cotton spinners and the grain exchanges came to&quot;fasnington in large numbers.   Many of them told me they intended to cooperate in every way possible in case the billbecame law.   I told them that for my part I wanted to drawto the limit on their technical knowledge and long years of experience.     So mreh, then for the steps leading up to the introductionof the bill into Congress.   The farm leaders kept their pledge to stay in session until they could agree upon a plan to affectthis year&apos;s crops; we have drafted a bill to implement their plan! the President has sent it to the Capitol, and now thequestion of farm relief is in the broad lap&apos;of Congress.     Now for the things the new farm bill proposes to do.     Its basic purpose, first of all, io to increase the purchasing power of farmers.  It i3, by that token, farm relief,but  it is also, by the same token, national relief, for it istrue that millions of urban unemployed will have a better chance of going back to work when farm purchasing power risesenough to buy the products of city factories.     The method to be used in increasing the farmer1s purchasingpower is by restoring the balance between production and consumption as rapidly as possible.   Let&apos;a help-the farmer,the  bill says in effect, plan his production to fit the effectivedemands of today&apos;s and tomorrow&apos;s - rather than yesterday&apos;s -market.
     The goal of the hill, in terms of price,  is  pre-warparity between the things the farmer sells  and the  thingsthe farmer buys.   Let me explain that.   In the pre-war years,1909 to 1914, wheat brought around 88 or 90 cents a bushelon the farm, cotton better than 12 cents a  pound, and hogsbetter than 7 cents a pound.   But at the same time,  theprices of the things the farmer had to buy  - his  fertilizer,farm machinery, and the like - were on a comparable level.In general, these items bought by the farmer were a littlelower than they are right now.  But the prices the  farmer gotfor his wheat and cotton and hogs were, in  those  pre-war days,more than twice as high as they are now.   It is  that gap thatwe want to bridge.   And this bill provides the bridge.     To reach that goal - a goal not to he  attained,  perhaps,in one brief year - the bill gives the Secretary  of Agriculturethese powerss     (1) To obtain, by contract with farmers, a voluntaryreduction in acreage or production of certain crops,  in returnfor which reduction producers will be compensated by  meansof rental or benefit payments.     (2) To enter into marketing agreements with  producers,marketing agencies, and processors of farm products.   Theintent of this provision is that there may  be organizedcommodity councils which will include both growers  andprocessors of a crop.   These councils will help  determinewhich plan of acreage reduction, what scale of taxation onthe processed goods may be wisest.  The recommendations of  thecouncil will then be considered by the Secretary  of Agriculturebefore any regulations are  issued.     (3) To license processors and distributing agencies thathandle agricultural products in Interstate o  foreign commerce,in the event that such licensing becomes necessary  in order to achieve the purposes of the bill.
     (4) To use the Smith cotton option contract plan on the                         - .. -1933 crop of cotton.     (5) To impose taxes on the processing of the basic farm products.   The amount of the tax, however, cannot he greaterthan is required to bring the market price up to the pre-warparity price.   Thus, if wheat is selling at 50 cents a bushel,whereas the pre-war price was 88 cents, there is a difference of 38 cents a bushel.   The tax on flour might, therefore,  beas much, but no more than, 38 cents (considering flour in termsof bushels of wheat).   The chances are that the tax would startat a relatively low figure, so as not to restrict retail sales of flour and thus reduce consumption.     The purpose of the tax, of course, is to collect funds withwhich to compensate those farmers who have contracted to reduce their production of the commodity so taxed.     The basic products to which the bill may apply are these:wheat, cotton, corn, tobacco, rice, hogs, cattle, sheep, and milk and its products.   But before any move is made tc tax anyone cf these products, or to attempt a reduction in production,it will be essential to oall in the representatives of bothproducers and processors of the product involved.  With their help we can work out for each commodity that method of productioncontrol, of taxation and compensation, which offers the best hope of success.  Under the taxing power, furthermore, there  isprovision for public hearings, so that in each step of the way we shall have the expert advice of those directly interested.     As I have said, different methods of production control  maybe applied to different crops.     Thus in reducing the production of hogs, the best methodmay be for the Government to pay the hog producer rent on aspeoified amount of his corn land, provided he retires thatacreage from corn production and also restricts the tonnage ofhogs marketed.                        ......      .     For a crcp such as wheat, the rental or benefit paymentmay be based primarily upon a reduction in acreage of wheat,
with certain provisos as to alternative uses of the land sorented.        Under the hill the Secretary is also at liberty to rentland in largo tracts or in selected regions,, or to allot the sumsfor land rentals by States end oountiea, so that ovory producerwill have an equal opportunity to rent a part of his land to theGovernment and to rooeive rental payments.        Nor is tho consumer&apos;a interest Ignored.  The consumer isamply safeguarded, first of all, by the fact that the tax passed on to him by the processor declines Just as rapidly as the pricethe farmer reoeivea for his product climbs to the pre-war level.Onoe pre-war parity is reached, the tax la completely removed. but even more important, the alight contribution the consumer willmake through retail prices will be more than compensated for bythe revived power of fprmora to buy the goods and services thocity ha3 to sell.  It is provided that in no oaso nill the farmersshare of the consumer1a dollar be more than in the pro-war period.       Thi3 bill, as the President says, follows a new and untrodpath...  The suoceaaful operation of It depends on the whole -he ar tedoooperation of farmers, prooessors, and consumers.  Has tho timecoins when all elements of our sooiety are willing to pull  .togethei-1 to restore economic balanoe and attain social justice?        It may be tx*ua that the things which thi3 bill strives to attain here and now may bo brought about 10 or 15 years hence bythe slow working of economic law.  Thia action, we hope, willspeed the Inovit-blo readjustments with much leas suffering thanundor the harah, hand of uncontrolled competition.        Seme farmers join with urb/anitaa in repudiating with horrorthe idea of reducing production at thia time.  T):oy poiivfc cut, veryproperly, that tho world la full of hvzigpy people, and tb.at thogreat quantities cf surplus foodstuffa should be used to foed them.
N0 supporter of this new farm Dill will disagree with this as an Ideal program.        As our eoonomio system works, however, it seems thatthe greater the surplus of wheat on Nebraska farms, the longer the bread lines in Now ^br k.  In a compile ate 6&quot;. world system ofexchange3 it seems to berooossary to maintain a balance between different groups of producers It wo are to avoid suffering.  Oursurpluses of food crops seem to have had as disastrous an effect upon national well-being as orop shortage used to have on theIsolated communities of a simpler age.        This bill attempts a major social experiment.  it looks towards a balanced social state.  It is trying to subduethe habitual anarohy of a major American industry and toestablish organized control in the interest.not only of the farmer, but of everybody else.
