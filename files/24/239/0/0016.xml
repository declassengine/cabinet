TSTOO^NT  IS THE PROPERTY  OF  HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT) .R^E T.                                                COPY  NO. L/ 56(331-                       C  A  B I H E T.                            rJO                       ----------                            6 O            The Ar,Tentine Negotiations.3jftd^eat.          Memorandum by  the Lintster of Agriculture  and Fisheries.  1.    The  proposal put forward by the President  of  the Board  of  Trade in his Memorandum  C.P*C5(33) raises  questions of the gravest  importance to home agriculture, and I wish  to put the folluwing  considerations before my colleagues.  2.    The general principles  which,, in the  interests of  home  agriculture, should govern the trade negotiations now taking  place  with the Argentine and Scandinavian countries have  been  discussed at  meetings of the Committee on  Commercial  Negotiations with Foreign  Countries, and between  the President of  the Board of Trade and  myself, and although formal decisions have  not been recorded  my  impression v/as that a considerable measure  of agreement  had been  reached on the following points:-  3.  (a) That the home producer was entitled to a reasonable         expansion in his share of the home market,  and that in the         case of meat it  would be difficult  to defend arrangements         which would restrict  this share  for any  length of time to         less than 50CA of the  total supplies.  At present, home         production accounts for 44$ of our beef  supplies, and 59%         cf our total meat supplies (including bacon) and if the         whole of a 15/5 cut in chilled meat  imports were  exercised,         and replaced entirely by homo supplies,  leaving  nothing for         any increase in  Dominion imports, the 50% figure would only         just be reached.     (b) That the right to exercise some  measure  of  control over         foreign imported foodstuffs, including meat, at  all events         during emergencies, could not safely be  dispensed with.     (c) That for purposes cf  negotiation with the                                   1.
n     Argentine, the United Ivlngdom Government mi^ht agree not to     impose a tariff on Argentine meat but should reservo the     right to impose a sufficient measure of quantitative regulation     to maintain a remunerative level of prices.4.   T?e have had little experience so far of the effect of any givenmeasure of quantitative control on the course of wholesale prices,and it  is aertainly not possible, with the Information at present available, to draw definite conclusions.   In any case, chilled beefcannot  be considered entirely apart from tne other meat supplieswhioh of oourse will also require supervision and regulation duringthe next 3 yearss5.   Imports of chilled beef into this country from the Argentineduring  the Ottawa  year amounted to 442,000 tons.   The proposal of the  President of the Board of Trade means that over only 10f3 ofthis amount would  it be possible to exercise any control before 1936.6.   That is to say, assuming that a remunerative level of wholesale prices  is to be achieved, only this small margin is available to dealwith possible expansion of home and Dominion supplies *  It should benoted under the fittawa Agreements, Australia and Sow Zealand areunfettered with regard to their shipments of meat after the end ofthe present year..    Since the modifications of our sanitary regulationsagreed  upon at Ottawa shipments of oattle from Canada have reachedconsiderable figures $ and there is every indication that this trade will continue to increase.7.   I  should have hoped that it might have been possibleto have concludod  an agree.aent as embodied in the first draftpresented to the Argentine Mission, i.e. stipulating                                 2o
inistry of Agriculture and Fisheries,      14th March,  1933.necessary in order to maintain a remunerative level of prices,8.    The President of the Board of Trade has, however, put to me very strongly the desirability of having some firedmaximum figure for the purpose of negotiation, and I recognisefully the Importance of making every effort to conclude a successful agreement.9.    I therefore suggest that a figure of 15% should be given as the maximum beyond which we 3hould bind ourselves not toreduce Argentine Imports of beef in any year.  It has to beremembered that, once given, this undertaking would hold us for three years whatever the state of the market, or the coursecf increasing home and Dominion production.  As indicated bythe President cf the Beard of Trade, we should reserve theright to make larger reductions in some seasons of the year than in others.10.   Considerable nervousness Is being felt by home producerswho fear that a big forward move in agriculture may beindefinitely postponed by agreements to accept, free of any duty or restriction, imports of foodstuffs on such a scale thatthey will leave little or no room for home expansion.  Theproposal which I now put forv/ard can be explained and defended,although not without giving a sore shock to those who arepinning great hopes on an agricultural revival in this country.To go further than this would, it seems tome, bo compromisingour whole position.
