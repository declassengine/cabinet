     I circulate, for the  consideration  of my  colleagues,  amemorandum  on the Rubber Industry  Bill.    This  Bill, whichla a Private Members&apos; Bill,  ia not  likely to make further progress unless it can  be  adopted  by  the Government.     It authorises the  Reaearoh Association of  British RubberManufacturers to collect a statutory  levy  (of  a  very small amount)  on all raw rubber used in  manufacture in the UnitedKingdom, the proceeds of which are  to be applied for thepurpose of  research.    If the Bill is not passed into law bythe end of  the Session, there is,   I  am  afraid,  no alternative but the dosing down of the Research  Association,  a prospectwhioh I hope my colleagues will agree would be most unfortunate.     I would suggest that  if the Bill is adopted it should beintroduced  forthwith in the House of  Lords, if the Secretary ofState for War sees no objection.    I  hope that the discussionthere may disclose the grounds on which any opposition to  theBill is based, and if the  opposition  oan be met  by explanationor amendment it should not be necessary to oooupy  much of  thetime of the House of Commons.

RUBBER INDUSTRY BILL.                 Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade a
                   RUBBER INDUSTRY  BILL *    1.   This  Bill  is promoted  by  a Committee representing anumber  of  trade organisations in the rubber Industry, andhas been introduoed as  a Private Member&apos;s  Bill.   Its purpose is  to obtain statutory  authority for a levy on all rawrubber  used  in manufacture in the Unxted Kingdom, theprooeeds of  the levy  being applied  for the purposes of  theResearoh Association  of British  Rubber Manuf acturers*   TheBill places  a limit of   15,000 a year to the inoome to  beraised  by  this means, and at  the present rate of consumptionof  rubber  the levy necessary  to  raise this sum would amount toabout one-f ortyf if th  of a penny  a lb  of raw rubber *    2 *   A similar  Bill was introduced in previous years*In  1931, it  obtained  a  second reading by 148 votes to 10,but no  time  was found for subsequent stages.  It has been supported  by members  in all parts of the House, including members of suooessive governments,  tut requests to have theBill adopted as a Government  Bill have hitherto been refused^     .  The  Bill  is now awaiting second reading, but a  blockingmotion  has been put  down and  there  is no likelihood of sufficient time being found for  its discussion.   Althoughthe Bill is  supported by all  the trade organisations in theindustry,  and the great majority of the manufacturing firms,there are  a  few reoalcitrantse   4.   In the meantime the Association is without funds andhas discharged most of its staff.    The laboratory and a nucleus staff are being retained for a few months in thehope that the Bill may pass this Session.   The Assooiatlonhas been assisted for many years by grant a from the Departmentof Scientific and Industrial Research,  but in accordance withthe usxial practice a higher proportion of trade subscriptionto Government grant is now expected than was the oase in theearlier years of the Association&apos;a lifeo  A fair amount of-1-
 support has been obtained from the numerous firms  in  the trade,  but a number of prominent  firms  do not  subscribe, including the large tyre-malting concerns that  were established here  by foreign interests  after  the duty was  imposed on motor tyres.    The largest firm, the Dunlop Rubber Company, has now withdrawn its suppoz^t, ainoe  it sees no reason for making large oontributions to the organisation when  important competitors aooept  no suoh obligation.   The  Dunlop Company  supports the Bill, however, and  in fact has continued its subscription to the   Association during the last  few years  in the  hope of the  Bill becoming law - this despite the fact that under the provisions of the Bill its pontributicn will probably increase about threefold.  It is represented  on the  Committee that has promoted the Bill.   There  is  no doubt that  nearly all the rubber trade regard the method of the Bill as  the most suitable one in their case for raising  funds for co-operative research,    5*   There is unfortunately,  little doubt that the Association will be  dissolved in  a few  months1 time unless some assistance is  given  in regard to  the  Billo  Suoh a result seems inconsistent with our general  trade policy;  muoh of the value of the stimulus now being applied to industry will be lost if adequate  provision for  research is not maintained.  The dissolution now of a  research association of some  13  years1 standing,  serving an  industry of  this size, would  therefore be extremely  unfortunate.    This view will  almost certainly be  that  of  all  but a  few  members  in all parts of both Houses ofParliament.   6.   In  these circumstances it  is for consideration whetherthe Bill should not be adopted  by the Government.  A proposal was oonsidered  some months  ago  by the Advisory Council of theDepartment  of Scientific  and Industrial  Researoh for a generalBill to enable a statutory levy on raw material to  be made  by                          -3-
 industry for purposes  of research.  The proposal did. not commend itself to  the  Research Associations generally;  many of them feared that the autonomy  of the Associations would be impaired and  their  usefulness  destroyed by the compulsory membership of firms with little Interest in reaearoh questions.   The Advisory Council, while not reoomnending that general powers should  be sought,  added that &quot;if an individual Research Association should succeed in procuring the introduction of  a  Bill in Parliament to make a levy compulsory, we hope that it will receive full support from the industry concerned&quot;.   7*  The Committee on Hew industrial Development, which was appointed by the Economic Advisory Council and of which the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs was Chairman, also cane to the conclusion that general powers should not be taken to enforce compulsory  levies for  the support of Research Associations.   The report of the Committee adds, however, that &quot;should  an industry succeed in working out a practicable soheme Involving a compulsory levy for the support of a Research Association, which it  can show commands the support of a substantial majority of the industry, including the larger concerns, we consider  that the Government should be ready to assist the industry in obtaining  the necessary Parliamentary powers&quot;,   8.  It will be remembered that a somewhat similar levy on raw material ha3 been  in operation in the cotton industry for some years, the proceeds in that  case heing devoted to thework of the Empire Cotton Growing Corporation.    The Bills forgiving statutory effect to the levy have been Private Members&apos; Bills, and it  could be  made clear that the adoption of the Bin did not indicate that the Government would be prepared toadopt a similar^ccurse  in regard to other Bills dealing withthe interests  of particular- industriesa    One reason for making                            -3-
                                                          G *7                                                          *? *an exoeptlon in this case would be to give an opportunity fora trial of this new method of raising funds for industrial research Associations.    The Bill as drafted is due to expire at the end of 1938.Board of Trade,  15th Maroh, 1933.
