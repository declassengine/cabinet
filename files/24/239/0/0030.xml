SmJSUsidJ^     80(33).                                                                 142                      CAB I N &apos;4 T.                 to  the Teap^ng Professl 911.      Memorandum by  the Secretary of fltate for Soot lend.           1.   The  President of the Board of  Education and the      Chancellor of  the Exchequer have circulated memoranda, dealing      primarily with the question of reducing  the rates of pay of      new entrants to the teaching profession  in England and Wales.      I submit  my views on this diffioult  problem not only in its      Scottish  application but generally,   For it seems to me      that any  decision as to England would almost neoesearily rule      the position in Scotland.   It is agreed,  I think, that there      must bo a general equality in the treatment of the teachers      throughout Great Britain.           2.   Soms time before seeing these  memoranda and before      I had thb discussion with the Scottish Eduoation Authorities      to whioh  I refer latsr I had already coue to the  definite      conclusion that there should be a reduction of salary aealas      for n*w entrants to the Scottish teaching profession in rather      greater measure than that imposed on existing teachers -      though not necessarily at a uniform rate for all  classes of      teacher.    My  reasons for this are substantially  the same as      those S&apos;\-t out  in the Chancellor&apos;s memorandum, although my      conclusion was reached independently.   I aocopt*d the deoision      that, having regard to teachers&apos; commitments and  expectations,      the cut for existing teachers should bo  limited to 10 p-r cent.      But, equally,  I f*lt that we should look at the new entrants      as an independent problem and should consider their scales      separately in  the light of the recommendationa received from      the representative Committees we have s*&apos;t up.
                                                               1 3 *3                                                               1 &apos;Ji O     3.   Amongst other important recouimendations for securingeconomy by reductions in salary scales the Lovat Committee proposedthat the Minimum  rational scales for new entrants in scotland should be reduced by 15 per cent, calculated on the scales in forceprior tc the Autumn &apos;-f 1931.   Last week I met representatives of nearly all the Education Authorities in Scotland and I found themvery insistent upon freedom to economise further in salaries,especially    their grants for the coming financial year ara to be^substantially reduced.   It will, in any case, be very difficultindeed to restrain some Authorities from cutting the s&amp;lariesof .-xi3ting teachers by more than 10 per cent., and particularly30 if no conceauiion tc the views of the Lovat Committeecenctrning future entrants is made.   The President of theBoard of Education1a argument that an additional cut for newentrant a would moot with opposition from many EducationAuthorities would, I am aura, not be applicable to Scotland.On the contrary, the Scottish Authorities would probably feelthat such a concession was but a &quot;small mercy&quot; compared with the much larger economies on teachers&apos; salaries which they looked for as a result of the investigations and recommendations oftheir own representative Committee.     4.   Tho teachers, would probably claim that it would bevery undesirable to split the profession into two bodies paid under different scales.   But it seems to me that this is a difficulty that will remain so long as existing teachers aresafeguarded at the 10 per cent, level, and as we must faoe it if we are ever to secure a further economy in salaries we might as well face it now as later.   In thia connection it maybe remarked that both the Ruy Committee and the Lovat committee made recommendations as to the salaries of existing teaoherswhich the Government have decided not to adopt.  To that extent the existing teachers have been treated more generously than
they might haTe had reason to expect.    And,  accordingly,  theyshould not he 30 unwilling to accept a proposal for an additionalcut in the salaries of new entrants.     5.   I do not wish to stress unduly the  principle ofsupply and demand in relation to teachers&apos;  salaries.    But itis fair tc point out that even with salaries  as now cut thereis no evidence whatever to show that supply in Scotland isendangered.   On the contrary,  the number who desire  to enter the Training Colleges is in excess of the prol-ablo requirementand so we have had to impose a scheme of restriction.   Andthere ia in Scotland a. number of fully trained teachers who cannot secure employment at present.   These  facts seem toindicate that the teaching profession maintains its attractionfor young people as compared with other professions andemployments.   I do not think that a further  five per oent.cut for new entrants would produce a shortage of numbers ora lowering in quality.     6.   I am very much impressed by what the Chancellorsays as to the grov/lng burden cf the pension  charges.   Inthe estimates for Scottish Education this year, the saving of  212,583 in the General Aid Grant ia neutralised to avery considerable extent &quot;by the increase of  101,540 in the superannuation Grant.   In any comparison batv/ean pre-warsalaries and present salaries even as cut,  the post-warpension scheme ia a very considerable asset to the teachurs.     7.   It is anticipated that in Scotland  reduction inthe number of teachers comparable with that in England willbe effected.   The reduction  in grants will  necessarily cause the Education Authorities to examine this question very closely.But I do not fuel that this should be allowed to affect the.3alary issue.   The two questions are, in my  view, independent and economy should be sought along both lines at the samet ime.
                                                                115              0 .    I do not wish, at  this  stage to commit  nyet-lf  as  to         the  method by which the details  of a reduced scale  for  new         entrants  in Scotland might  be  examined.   But I  think that,         even if a Committee is  s*it  up  for the purpose, it  should not         be giv-jn  an open reference; it  should be limited  to  the         question  of how in detail an over-all earing of  about five         per  cent, on the expenditure on  new entrants&apos;  salaries  can be         effected.   If a Committee  is  given an open reference,  as  in         the  case  of the Police  Pay  (New  Entrants) Committee,  I  fear         that wa may he faced with recommendations which  do  not  secure         the  economies desired.   In Scotland the further reduction         should not necessarily  be at a flat rate of five p,:r  oent. on         all  salaries .   I  should like  to he free - whether  on the         advice of a Committee or otherwise - to reoaet the  scales  in         various particulars - especially in the relationship  between         the  salaries of graduates and  non-graduate6 - with  the  aim         of effecting on the total expenditure a saving of the order         of the suggested additional five per oent.   But on the general         question  of polioy now  under discussion I feel that I must         strongly  support the view put  forward by tho Chanoellor of         the  Exchequer .                                                       G.P.C.Soottiah  Education Eepartment,     24 th March, 1933.
