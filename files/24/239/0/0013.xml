           TRAWLING IJg THB MORAY FIRYii and ^^R/JH. OF CLYDS^        Memorandum by the Secretary of State f 01 3c o tland,.            On the question referred to  In the iiemorandum  C0Po58 (33) by the Secretary of State  for Foreign Affairs  my view is in agreement with that expressed in my predecessorTF9  Memoranda 0oPo35 (32) and 269 (32) p namely, that without  claiming the Moray Firth and the Firth of Clyde as  &quot;territorial waters&quot; or asking for their recognition  as  &quot;exclusive fishery limits&quot; an endeavour should &quot;be made to  secure the negotiation of a special international a&amp;Fgsment  the object of whieh would he to require foreign vesRels ts  simply with the same restrictions as those to which British  vessels are subject in these areas.    Accordingly,. I  recommend that effect be given to the  decision of the Cabinet  of ilth February0 1932, by the despatch of a Note to  the  Netherlands Minister on the lines indicated in previjUB  Memoranda,, intimating the readineos of H\ Ms Government to  participate in the revision of the North Sea Fisheries  Convention and prooosing the inclusion in  the Agenda  of a  discussion of the question of trawling in  the Moray Firth  and  the l?u-tJi of Clyde with a view to securing an  eg^OT-ftftt  abov eminent ion ed,    For convenience of  reference  I attach a  copy of the suggested Note which was appended  to my  predecessors Memorandum,  Ca P, 260 (32)*                                   (&amp;&amp;..)

       Draft Wote to Netherlands Minister embodying                       suggested modifloatlone,                                             Foreign Offioe-                                                 1933.Dir.1.         * have the honour to inform you that His K&amp;jesty&apos;eGovernment in the United Kingdom have given their oareful consldera^tion to the invitation whioh you were so good as to convey tothorn on behalf of the Netherlands Government in your note No0 622of the 22nd &quot;ay,  1931, to attend a conference at The Hague to revise the International Convention Regulating the Police ofthe North Sea fisheries of the 6th Way,  1882.   I am now able tsinfozmt you that Rio Majesty&apos;-8 Government will have much pleasurein  taking part in the revision of the convention, and that they agree that the points enumerated in your note under reply are suitable for diacuseion,2,         Hie Majesty&apos;s Government desire,  however, that the position with regard to trawling in the Moray &quot;Firth and Firth of Clydashould be taken into consideration on this occasion.   ab you aradoubtless aware,  trawling in these areas is prohibited in pursuanceof the Herring Fishery (Scotland) Aot, 1889.   Since 1907, howeverethe prohibition has not been enforced against foreign trawlers and foreim trawlers , therefore, enjoy a privilege over British trawlers by admission to the births.   Their admission arousesgreat complaint from the local fishermen, and His r.a,ieBty&apos;sGovernment feel that these complaints, which have been endorsed by several Committees of Inquiry, are not without justification.3.         -His Majesty&apos;8 Government desire,  therefore,, that the agenda of the oonference should include discussion of the possibility ofmaking arrangements under which, with the agreement of the signatories of the North Sea Convention, their trawlers wouldobserve the same restrictions as apply to British trawlers inpursuance of the Herring Fishery (Scotland) Act, 1889.                                                    4/
4.        I should bo greatly obliged If you would be eogood as to inform me, in due course, whether this proposedaddition to the .n^enda of the conference would beagreeable to the other Governments concerned.f n V
