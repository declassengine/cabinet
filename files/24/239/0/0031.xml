To the Eight Honourable    SIR PHILIP CUNLIFFE-LISTER,  G.B.E., M.C.,  M.P.,        Secretary of State  for the Colonies.SIR,  I was instructed  by you to proceed to Malaya in the autumn oflast year with  a view to  discussing with the High Commissioner,the Malay Rulers, and the leaders  of public opinion,  the proposalswhich  have been made to  decentralize certain  public  services inthe Federated Malay States.  You  took this course because you wished His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to have the fullest information at  first  hand on all aspectsof  the matter.  I  left London  on  20th  October,  1932,  and, travelling  viaMarseilles, reached  Penang  on 10th November, 1932.  In additionto paying visits to Penang, The Dindings, Malacca, and Singapore,I visited during my  stay in  Malaya the following Malay  states in  the  order  mentioned : Kedah,  Perlis, Perak,  Selangor, NegriSembilan,  Pahang,  and Johore;  and in  all  cases I  had  theopportunity of discussing with the Rulers, and in some cases theirState Councils  too, such  matters as they wished  me to  bring to your notice.  At Kuala Lumpur and Singapore at both of whichplaces  I stayed for some  days I had the advantage of being  ableto  confer, in the presence  of  the High Commissioner, with  theofficers of  the  Federated  Malay  States  and  Straits  SettlementsGovernments.  At  the end of a month&apos;s  stay in  Malaya  I  pro-ceeded, in accordance with  your instructions,  to visit Hong kong and Ceylon, eventually embarking for England at Colombo on  18thJanuary, arriving at Marseilles on 3rd February and in London on 4th February.  A full itinerary of my tour is given in Appendix I.  As regards the controversy during recent years  concerning thesystem of government in  the Federated Malay States, I intend to confine myself to giving a brief summary of the events which have led up to the  situation that exists  to-day, since  in my opinionlittle is to be gained  by repeating the arguments which have  beenput forward on one side or  the other.  I propose to  face facts as they are now,  and to suggest  to  youwhat appears to me  a possible solution of  the delicate  problem of reconciling the natural political  aspirations of  the  Rulers  with thepractical difficulties, economic and administrative, of decentralizinga system of government in  a territory the size of Malaya.  I would, however,  say in  this  introductory note  that I thinkthat  all those  who  have  given the situation in  Malaya  seriousthought very much  regret the difficulties that have arisen from  time   183S5                                                   A 2
to time  in the past twenty years between  successive High Com-missioners and the  officers holding the post of Kesident-General,or Chief Secretary, at  Kuala Lumpur,  culminating as  they  didsome years ago in  the  unconcealed  friction that existed betweenthe  holders of these two posts.  So far  as I have  been able toascertain,  the situation  then created has been  to  a great  extentresponsible for the change that, I am told,  has taken place in  thespirit of  co-operation and goodwill that had always existed between all sections? of the community before then.   Further, I am led tobelieve that the same situation paved the way for the growth of thefeeling of  suspicion and mistrust which  appears to exist  to-daybetween  the Colony  and  the Federated Malay States.  In dealing with the different aspects of  the decentralization pro-posals I  have done  so in what appears to me to be their order ofimportance, viz., political, financial  and economic, and administra-tive.  I mention the point because I think that there is a tendency in Malaya to exaggerate  the  administrative difficulties that may arise if  changes are made and to forget  that in  all cases the  ad-ministrative machine exists for the  benefit of the country and its people and not vice versa.  I  am  much indebted  to  the Governor and High  Commissionerfor  the  very excellent arrangements  which  he  made  in  order toenable me to carry out my  task.   I also  owe a  deep debt  of grattitude to the High Commissioner and rulers and all those whogave us  such a warm  welcome and extended to us so much kindhospitality.  1 have also to thank Mr.  Gent of the Colonial Office who accom-panied me as my  Private Secretary and has rendered me invaluableassistance.  Finally I wish  to record my deep  appreciation of the  courtesyof the Malayan Press, which, interested  as it was in the wholequestion  of decentralization and  the High Commissioners  policy.refrained during my tour in the country from publishing  any con-controversial matter on the  subject.                                             S.  H. WILSON.25r7i  February, 1933.
                        CHAPTER I.*   Constitutional and administrative developments up to the                        post-War period.  The original Treaties  concluded with  the Rulers of  the  malay states were not identical in terms, but each provided  for Britishprotection  and for assistance  in  administration  by  the  appoint-ment of a British officer by the Governor  of the Straits Settlementsto reside in each State.  The advice of that officer was to  be askedfor and octed upon in all  matters other than those touching Moham-inedan religion and custom.  The first of these Treaties was the Treaty of Pangkor concluded with  the  Chiefs  of  Perak in  1874.   In  the  fifteen  years  which followed, British Residents were also appointed in Selangor, NegriSernbilan,  and Pahang.   At  that time the  exploitation  of  thetin-ore resources by foreign, chiefly Chinese,  enterprise was leading to a rapid  opening up of the country :  and  the Malay Rulers andChiefs had neither the administrative organization nor  the resources to exercise proper control.  The result was that the British Residents had no option  but togather the reins  of  government into their own hands  in spite ofan explicit  statement by the British Government that their functions were not administrative.   This  statement  explained that a  Besidentwas jDlaced in a Native  State  as an  adviser,  not  as  a ruler,that his functions were  the giving of responsible advice,  and  thathe  was not to interfere more frequently or  to  a greater  extent than  was necessary  in the minor  details of administration.  Butit  did not  take full  account of the administrative inexperience ofthe Malay Rulers and the limited  resources at their disposal, orof the fact that at the time the Malay Governments  maintained a precarious  existence and  were to all intents totally lacking in jjroperorganization.  It  does not require a great stretch of  the  imagina-tion to understand how, in the circumstances,  the Besidents were forced to  create  and control  the administrative  systems  in  theStates and to expand and adapt them to meet the needs of  a rapidlydeveloping country.  The Malays, who shared in the growing prosperity which resulted,accepted the new regime without resentment,  but the rapidity ofthe country&apos;s material development outstripped the  advancementin education of the Malays.  The result was that Asiatics differingin religion and customs of life from the people  of the Peninsulawere recruited for  employment in commerce and  industry   and  * A general description of Malaya and its constituent parts is given inAppendix II.REPORT
monopolized the most prized posts in  the subordinate government services.  In  1893 the Marquess of Eipon,  then Secretary of State forthe Colonies,  suggested federation which the Governor welcomedas likely  to lighten his own  work  and to promote co-co-ordination between  the four States concerned.  In 1895 a draft scheme of federation  was approved by  Mr. JosephChamberlain,  who  laid down that no pains  should be spared tosafeguard the  position and dignity of the Malay Rulers, that theyshould te invited  to continue  to co-operate with their  Britishadvisers  in promoting the  advancement of their respective terri-tories and subjects, and that they should be given the assurance that such changes as were to  be made were  solely intended topromote  strength by co-operation.  Further they were to be assured that in  binding  themselves and  their States they would not bediminishing in the slightest degree the powers and privileges they then  possessed  nor would they  be  curtailing  the right of self-government which  they enjoyed.  In  the result the  Treaty of  Federation  of 1895, the terms ofwhich are reproduced in  Appendix III, was  readily signed  bytho Rulers of the four States of Perak, Selangor, Negri Sembilan.and Pahang.  On a  strict interpretation the terms of the Treaty are in some respects  contradictory.  It may  however be maintained :        (a) That the  Treaty itself conveyed  no power of control    to   the  Resident-General,  whose office  was  created under    Clause 4, nor did it  in any  way change the  advisory status    of the Governors representative.       (b) That the term &quot; Federation &quot; as applied to the form of    union created by  the Treaty- was a misnomer, since the Treaty    did  not establish any7 central Government,  did not make any    attempt at a division of  powers,  but did on the contrary pre-    serve all  former State rights.   Various and  conflicting as are the opinions which have been expressed by persons of knowledge  and authority on the  precise intentions of  those who drafted the Treaty, there  can  be no doubt that  it did in fact  effect substantial changes.   For  example previous to the Treaty  the  de  facto executive power (matters concerning Mohammedan religion and Malay custom excepted) had been left by the Ruler in each State to his British Resident, who consulted the  Ruler whenever he thought desirable. The  creation, as the result of the Treaty, of a Federal Secretariat under a Resident-General, whose advice  had  to  be followed in all matters of  administration,  removed  many of  the powers pre- viously  exercised by the Residents to a superior authority who was not in  continuous  and personal  touch with the Rulers;  and the same authority  took over complete  supervision of the rapidly ex- panding finances  of the States  : and the  unified control which resulted was a great  stimulus to  commerce and development.
  The State Governments, even if they had wished, were powerlessto check centralization in the Federal Government and to  escape from the ever expanding activities of the federal departments.  From time to time there were isolated protests from  individualsagainst  encroachments by the Federal Government;  and in 1903the Sultan of Perak, at an annual meeting of the Rulers, pleadedfor the  maintenance of State rights,  but on the whole there canbe little doubt  that there was general acquiescence in  the  federalsystem, where there was not whole-hearted approval.  The  first attempt to modify the system was made by Sir john anderson  in 1909, because at that date he considered there was astrong  feeling on the part of the  Malay Rulers against  the  loss of authority  by the State  Governments.   He decided to  curtail  thepowers of the Resident-General and the  federal  machine,  by  thecreation of a Federal Council with the  High Commissioner himself as President and including the Rulers  and Residents  as members.He also instituted conferences between  the High Commissioner, the resident-General, and the Residents with a view to keeping  theHigh Commissioner in direct touch with  the views of the Rulers.Finally  he changed  the title of  &quot; Resident-General  &quot;  to  that of&quot;Chief Secretary to Government &quot;.   The   Federal  Council was accordingly  constituted  under  theterms of  an Agreement,  concluded  with  the four Rulers  of  theFederated States in October, 1909.   The  terms of  this  agreement are reproduced in Appendix IV (i).  This Agreement may be said to mark a definite attempt to create a genuine federal  system.  Legal  critics have pointed  out the in-consistencies of  the actual.terms of the Agreement, but, whatever its shortcomings may have been,  it did create the Federal council as the  main legislative and  financial authority  for the federated malay  States, and it did attempt a division of powers by allocatingcertain questions to the sphere of the  State Councils.  The  change of title of the Resident-General was  also effected,but no  actual  steps  had been taken to restrict his powers beforeSir John Anderson&apos;s term as High Commissioner came to  an  end in 1911: and it is interesting to  note  in this connexion, that  thefirst Chief Secretary in his Annual  Report for  1910  recorded  thechange in title,  but at the same time observed that the duties  and responsibilities  of the post would  remain the same.   The  years 1910-13  marked a great  expansion in  the  rubberplantation  industry,  high prices in the  tin mining industry,  andphenomenal increases in Government revenues: and in  the generalrush of development,  bringing with  it  increased  prosperity,  anydiscontent with  the  highly centralized  bureaucracy   at  KualaLumpur seems to have been forgotten.   This period was followed by the War when everything was sub-ordinated to  the Empire&apos;s  struggle for existence.   During thesecritical years the Malay Rulers and their peoples were  in the first
rank  in  their generosity and  their eagerness to help the Britishcause.  The many difficult problems which arose in the Federation wereably  handled  by the  Chief  Secretary  to  Government  and  hisassistants, and the many  fresh extensions of bureaucratic controlwent unchallenged.                         CHAPTER II.  Constitutional  and administrative developments subsequent  to                            the War.  When  Sir  Laurence  Guillemard  took  up  the  duties  of  HighCommissioner in February, 1920, he  found that some of the Rulersof the Federated States were not satisfied  with the  position andwere  apprehensive that federal encroachment might grow  worse.  The sequel was that the whole question of the future of the malay states came under consideration, and in December, 1921, the  HighCommissioner  was  authorized  to  make  a  declaration  in  theFederal  Council  to  the  effect that it  was not  the policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to  extend the Federation to embrace anyof the States  not already included, unless at  their own wish, butto aim at friendly co-operation between the  Colony, the FederatedStates,  and  the  Unfederated  States on  all  matters  of  common interest.  In  the following \rear it was announced in the Federal council that the question of the transfer of power from the Federal to  theState Governments was under consideration, and that  it was hoped to increase the powers and functions  of the State Councils in some important respects;  and assurances were given from  time to time during this period,  that it  was  the intention  of  His Majesty&apos;;Government to give effect  to a policy of decentralization.  Slow  progress  was made, however, in giving any  practical  effectto these assurances, and the first  step which calls  for notice wasthe passing of an enactment in April, 1924,  which empowered  theChief Secretary  to dispense, by notification  in the Gazette, withthose statutory provisions  which necessitated the approval of  theChief Secretary being given before a  Resident could take action incertain matters.  During a visit to England in August, 1924, His Highness  the sultan of Ferak  took the opportunity to visit Mr. J.  H.  Thomas.then Secretary of State  for the Colonies, to  ask for the restriction of the powers  of  the federal authority and the transfer to the  Stateauthorities of  the control of their domestic affairs.  In 1925,Sir Laurence Guillemard, the High Commissioner,visitedEngland and discussed the  question with Mr. Amery, who was thenSecretary of State for the Colonies.  As the result of these discussions,  an official announcement wasmade in the Malayan press to  the  effect that it had been  common ground  for years past  that the administration of  the federated malay States  was too highly centralized and  that the root of  the
difficulty lay in the great powers of control which were vested inthe Chief Secretary; and it was stated that the whole question wasunder consideration.  Sir Laurence Guilleniard, who returned to  Malaya towards theend of 1925,  explained in December of that  year to the federal council  that the Government  was committed to a policy of decent-ualization and that the  logical outcome of that  policy was the gradual  devolution of the powers of the Chief Secretary  until theoffice as then  constituted practically ceased to exist.  The HighCommissioner  also suggested to the Federal Council the possibilityof the rulers  electing in due course to withdraw from  member-ship  of  the Council to the serener atmosphere  of an  Upper Houseor periodical Durbar; and he  expressed the view that it  might befound to be a good thing if only members of the State  Councils wereeligible  for  appointment as  unofficial members  of  the  federal council.  Opposition  to the  policy of  decentralization concentrated on theproposal to reduce the powers and status of the Chief Secretary : andthe subsequent controversy showed that the European and Chineseunofficial members of the Council, and practically  the whole com-mercial  community took the same view.  They  argued that a reduc-tion  of  the powers of the Chief Secretary as proposed would, to alarge extent, release  the State  Governments  and the Residents fromthe control of the Federal authority, and would shake public con-tidence  in the financial stability of the Federated Malay States.  Progress towards giving effect to a policy7 of  decentralization wasmade in two  respects before Sir Laurence Guillemard&apos;s term of iffice (which  had been  extended for one year on account  of theproposals) came to an end in  1927.  These  were :       (a) The rearrangement in 1927  of  the vaiious Pleads of     Expenditure  in the Annual Estimates in  three  categories as     follows :           (i)  Federal Services  to be provided  for in the Federal        Estimates.          (ii) Reserved  (State)   Services to be shown in the State        Estimates.          (iii) Unreserved  Services  to be  regarded as  not yet        finally allocated, and to be susceptible of classification in        either the  Reserved  (State) Estimates,  or the Federal        Estimates and  to  be shown in a volume  &quot; Unreserved        Services.&quot;      (6) The conclusion in  1927 of a new Agreement* with the     Rulers for  the reconstitution of  the  Federal  Council.  By    this reconstitution the  Rulers withdrew from  active member-    ship of  the  Council though retaining the right  to be  present    at  any  meeting if  they  wished;  the unofficial membership    of the Council was  enlarged  to  give it a  more  representative    character  and its legislative and financial authority was defined.      * For the terms of this Agreement see Appendix IV (ii).18385
  No further steps towards giving effect to a decentralization policvwere  taken  during  the time that Sir Hugh Clifford held the post of Governor and High Commissioner, and it was not until 1930,when Sir Cecil Clementi took up the appointment,  that the ques-tion of  taking further steps was raised.  In  this year (1930)  the  four Rulers re-opened the question ofdecentralization  at  the Annual  Durbar, and  in  the  following year the  High  Commissioner,  who was home on leave in England.discussed the matter with Lord Passfield, who was then Secretaryof State for the Colonies.  As the result of this discussion, the Secretary of State wrote to theofficer who was acting as High Commissioner informing him thaihe  agreed with  Sir  Cecil Clementi&apos;s views as to the existing Con-stitution  being  capable of  improvement, and added  that,  as ;ipreliminary  measure, it was desirable to explore the question of how  far the defects in  the  existing relations between the Severn 1States and Settlements in  the Peninsula could  be  remedied.  Atthe same time the  Secretary  of State pointed out that the problem was a large one and would  require  full consideration in  Malayabefore  any  definite  proposals  were  submitted  to  His Majesty&apos;s Government for consideration :  and he  explained that  he  had authorized  Sir Cecil Clementi on  his return to  Malaya to discuss his proposals with the Rulers and to ascertain their views.  In August of the same year, Sir  Cecil Clementi, after his return to Malaya explained to the Rulers at a Durbar held at Sri Menanti his proposals for giving effect to a policy of decentralization : and he  dealt with the matter still further in an address to the Federal Council on 14th November,  1931,  and at a  Durbar held at Pekan in April, 1932.  It was in connexion  with these  proposals that I was instructed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to visit Malaya, and they are consequently fully dealt with in the succeeding chapters of  this Report.  I will confine myself therefore, at this stage, to  giving a brief summary of  their scope.   The proposals as adumbrated by the  High  Commissioner at the Sri Menanti and Pekan Durbars provide for :          (a)  The transfer to the State Governments  of  the control      of the  following  departments,  viz.,  Agricultural,  Co-opera-      tive,  Educational, Electrical,   Forestry,  Medical,  Mining.      Public Works, and Veterinary.*        (b) The strengthening of the State Councils and an extension      of their powers.         (c) The  abolition of the  post of  Chief Secretary  as  now      constituted.    * The Drainage and Irrigation Department  which is now  a separate  department was at this timo included in tho Public Works Department. The  Prisons department has been subsequently added to the list.
      (d)  The  control of the Railways by a new railway board    to be  appointed in addition to the existing Advisory Board ;    and the  control of Posts,  Telegraphs, and Telephones  by a    postal board.      (c)  The organization of certain services such as Customs and    Surveys on a pan-Malayan basis.      (/)  The  discontinuance  of  the  system  of  having in the    Colony  and  the  Federated  Malay  States  separate  heads  of    certain departments, and the creation of  a single head of each    service for the whole of Malaya,  these  officers being vested    with executive powers in the  Colony  but only with advisory    powers in the Malay States.      in)  The  abolition of that volume of the Estimates entitled    &quot; Unreserved Services &quot;, thus reducing the number of volumes    of Estimates in future from six to five, the services shown at    present  under &quot; Unreserved Services &quot; being  shown  in either    the Federal  volume or the State volumes; those  whose final    allocation is not decided being marked with a note to that effect.  The  announcement  of  the High Commissioner was  welcomed by the Rulers of  the Federated  States,  but many of the proposals,and particularly that for the abolition of the post of  Chief Secretary,were soon the  subject of  public criticism.  Indeed, very  consider-able  opposition has been  shown by the business community as awhole European, Chinese, and Indian to the proposed  abolitionof the post  of  Chief Secretary.  The  reasons  for this oppositionare similar to those which underlay the criticism  of the proposals made by Sir Laurence Guillemard some seven years earlier.  It is interesting to note that the criticisms of Sir  Cecil Clementi&apos;sproposals  show a particular  apprehension that what will result is not so much decentralization in the  Federated  Malay States ascentralization  in  Singapore.   The possibility of  stich a  situation arising appears to be viewed with  dismay  by the  commercial and business communities in the Federated Malay  States, who freelyexpress the view that in such  circumstances their interests would lie sacrificed to those of the  Colony.                        CHAPTER III.         Political aspects of decentralization proposals.  From a purely economic point of view it would  no doubt be ad-visable in a country the size of Malaya to have one  Central Govern-ment administering the whole territory.  There is,  however, the political aspect  of  the problem; and as pointed out in the previous Chapter, the creation outside the termsof  the Treaties  and   Agreements   of  the  highly   centralizedbureaucracy  that exists at Kuala Lumpur  to-day has led in recent   1S385                                                   A 4
years to a growing  wish on the part of the Rulers for a transfer to the State Governments of more control of their own affairs, amifor the assimilation  of the position of the Rulers of the FederatedStates to that of  the Rulers of the Unfederated States.  Furtherthere can be  little doubt that the events of  recent years have en-couraged  the Rulers to  believe  that  it  is  the  intention  of HisMajesty&apos;s Government  to adopt  in the near future a policy ofdecentralization : and the  adoption of any other course now would.I am afraid, shake  to a great extent the confidence  of  the Rulersin the bona fides  of the British Government.  Without doubt the rulers  one  and   all   expect  some   considerable   measure  ofdecentralization.  Moreover it seems clear that the maintenance of  the position.authority,  and  prestige of the  Malay  Rulers must  always  be acardinal point in British policy : and the encouragement of indirectrule will probably prove the greatest safeguard  against the politic:;isubmersion of the Malays which would  result from the developmen!of popular government on western lines.  For, in  such a govern-ment the Malays would  be hopelessly  outnumbered  by the  otherraces owing to the great influx  of immigrants that has taken  placeinto Malaya during  the last few years.  Politically  everything seems  to  point to  the desirability of the rulers  and their respective  Governments being allowed to havecontrol of  their own domestic  affairs  without interference exceptin those cases where a unified policy is clearly  necessary.  That this  should  be the ultimate political relationship betweenthe different Governments of  Malaya appears to be the High  Com-missioner&apos;s  view, having  regard to his pronouncement  at  the  SriMenanti Durbar in  August, 1931, and  to the decentralization pro-posals that he has formulated during his three years&apos; tenure of office which are designed  to  assimilate the position of the  Rulers of  theFederated States to  that of the  Rulers  of the Unfederated States.   Some closer assimilation is obviously an essential preliminary toany scheme for the promotion of co-operation  between the con-stituent parts  of  Malaya  as a whole, and until the knot now tiedso  tightly in the Federated States can be loosened it  would appearhopeless to suggest that the Rulers of the Unfederated States should come  into any form of  Malayan  T.-eague, or  even agree to meet together periodically to  discuss matters of  common interest.  Apossible  explanation   of why  the    High  Commissioner  ha;not made a  more  explicit statement  in regard to  his proposalsfor decentralization is firstly the  fact  that the Secretary of state has not yet  approved a  decentralization policy as  a  whole, and secondly  a reluctance  on the  part  of  the  High Commissioner todo anything  that might  arouse a suspicion in  the  minds of the rulers of the Unfederated  States that there  was an intention offorcing them against their will into any form of closer union.
  Any such suspicion would, as I have pointed out to those Rulerswhom I have  had the  honour of meeting,  have  been quite un-justified because, as I was authorized to  tell  Then; Highnesses the sultan of Johore and  the Regent of Kedah, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-inent have no intention of requiring  the  Ruler of any UnfederatedState to enter  against his will  into  any  kind of Malayan Leagueor Union.  On the  other hand, and while there is no  such  intention on thepart of His Majesty&apos;s Government, it is obvious, as I have pointedout to Their Highnesses the Sultan of Johore and the Regent ofKedah,  that there must be many  questions on  which joint dis-cussion  could not but be  of advantage to every constituent part of malaya; and, as I have suggested to  these Rulers,  this can be done without interfering to any great  extent  with  their natural  desireto retain their  independence in  the  administration  of the domestic affairs of their  States.  However, from my discussions with Their  Highnesses it appearsto me that these two Rulers would  be  very reluctant  to commit themselves at the present time to any closer co-operation than thereis to-day with  the other  Governments in Malaya: and  from whatT learnt from  the  British Advisers  in Kelantan,  Trengganu, andPerlis, the Rulers of those  States would take the same  view.  Everything  seems  to point to its  being some considerable time before the  Rulers of the  Unfederated States  are likely  to  agree todo more than  take part in occasional Durbars, or  Conferences, forthe discussion of questions of interest to Malaya as a whole : andI think also that the day  is  a long way  off before  it will be practicable, or  desirable,  to  decentralize  to such an extent  in theFederated States as to put the Rulers of these States in  exactly thesame position  as that in which the Rulers of the UnfederatedStates are to-day.  Time and experience alone will show  to what extent it will bepossible to assimilate the positions of the two sets of Rulers.  I am of  opinion,  however,  that  for  political reasons  there iseverything to be said  for  the gradual substitution in the federated malay States of a genuine federal system for what the  High  Com-missioner  describes as the &quot; amalgamation &quot; of to-day, and  I amof opinion  that,  as the  first stage in carrying out such  a policy,effect might be given to the proposals  adumbrated by the  HighCommissioner  at  the  Sri Menanti  Durbar  in  August, 1931, for putting  the Agricultural, Co-operative,   Educational,  Electrical,Forestry, Medical, Mining, Public Works, and Veterinary Depart-ments under State control.*  It is not possible at the present timeto visualize what changes may prove desirable in the  subsequent  *  The Prisons Department has since been added  to this list  and I see noobjection to its inclusion. The Drainage  and  Irrigation Department whichwas part of the Public Works Department has been  separated from it.18385
stages, but those which one can foresee as likely to be most urgentwill  be primarily financial  and administrative  and they are deal?with in the two  following Chapters.  As another political aspect  of  the  problem  of  decentralization,I should mention that the representatives of the Chinese and other non-Malay communities strongly  pressed  their claim that the in-terests of non-Malays born in the Malay States should not sufferas the result of any decentralization proposals that may be approved.I deal with the anxiety shown by these communities in Chapter VII.  It is &quot;lso right to mention in this Chapter that the increase thaihas been  made  recently in the composition of the State Councilsis likely to strengthen the  demand on the part of the  Rulers andthe State Governments for more  control in the  administration oftheir own affairs.  To summarize, there is  a strong case  on political grounds forgiving the Rulers of the Federated Malay States control  of theirown domestic affairs,  and I recommend that as a beginning effect should be given during the  next four years to the scheme proposedby the High Commissioner at  the Sri Menanti Durbar  in  August,1931, for putting the Agricultural, Co-operative, Educational, Elec-trical,  Forestry,  Medical,  Mining, Public Works, and  VeterinaryDepartments under State Control8.                        CHAPTER IV.   Financial and economic aspects of decentralization proposals.  The great importance that must be attached to the financial andeconomic  aspects of any  scheme  of devolution makes  it desirableat this ttage to consider the matter from these aspects.  A local  committee which met for this purpose in 1932 expressedthe view that, in no circumstances should a policy of decentraliza-tion be allowed  to impair to any  degree the financial stability and credit  of the Federated Malay  States as they exist to-day.   Thecommittee emphasized the fact that any changes made in the mutualrelationship of  the Federal  and State  authorities must  not  be such as to weaken that essential political cohesion and joint financial responsibility  on which  those who lent money to the  federation in the past confidently relied.   The interests of others who haveinvested a large amount of capital in schemes for  the developmentof the country and its resources  should also be borne  in mind inthis connexion.   It seems unlikely  that  the future  development  of the  country can proceed without recourse to the  raising of loans from  outside,and to use the  words of  the  local  committee which consideredthe  matter  it is essential that the Federation should be able &quot; to  * The Drainage and Irrigation and tho Prisons  Departments should beadded to this list.
enter the money market in the future with  credentials  no whitless convincing than those it carried in the past &quot;.  From my discussions with the Rulers, I feel  sure that they allagree with the view expressed by the local committee to the effectthat &quot; political devolution  cannot  be  purchased at the  price  offinancial dissolution &quot;.  At  the  same time I  submit that a measure of decentralizationcould be effected which, while giving to the Rulers and their StateCouncils practically a  free hand in  the administration  of theirown affairs, would  at the same  time safeguard the financial credit of the Federation  by keeping  the  general  control  of  finance  inthe hands of  a central authority, on  which the Rulers would  berepresented.  Again, I venture to think that, apart from  the question of  con-fidence,  there  will for some  time  to  come be a need for some form of central fund in the Federation from which the developmentof the weaker and  less wealthy States can be assisted,  a develop-nient which must  be regarded  as  a potential asset  to  Malaya  asa whole.  When I express  these views,  I do not  mean to imply that thereis not a great deal to be said for handing over  the control of the&quot; spending departments &quot; to the State Governments.   It has beensuggested to me  that a good  deal  of  the extravagant expenditurein recent years has been due to  the fact that those who have urged the  carrying  out  of certain  services have  not  been  responsiblefor finding the money to pay for  them.   Moreover the State authori-ties who are in close touch with the details of what  is being donemust be in a much better position to see that  there is no unneces-sary extravagance than the Heads of the Federal Departments who can  only take decisions  on the  advice  they receive from then-State offieei-s  and  can  only at the  best paj- periodical  visits  tothe different States.  In  a genuine federal system there  should  be a  clear divisionof legislative and other powers between  the  Central Governmenton the one  hand and  the State Governments on the other;  but,if a policy of decentralization is  introduced in the Federated malay states, there will be for some time to come, and certainly  duringthe transitional period, certain  questions which as regards policy will have to remain subject to  a common control, but  as regardsdetailed  administration  can with  convenience  and  economy  beleft to the State Governments.   In this  category I would include certain matters on  which a uniform policy is of  particular interestto the commercial community, such as regulations for dealing withmining lands,  standard of health on estates, measures for preven-tion of floods, forest reserves, and so on.  I do not anticipate any practical difficulty in  ensuring  uniformity of policy  on such  questions although  under State control, sincemy proposal is that for  dealing with them the  High Commissioner   18385                                                   A 6
should have  an Advisory  Council&quot; on  which  the State Govern-ments will be  represented :  and in addition the Rulers are to  beinvited to appoint both the Legal Adviser and the Federal Treasurerof  the  Federated  Malay  States  Government  to  be memberof their State  Councils, and  these two  officers, together with the resident in each State, will  be  available  to assist  the Rulers andtheir State Councils with information  as to the  necessity for a uniform policy.  I am of opinion  that from the point  of view  of finance  there isa strong case for adopting a decentralization policy  which, while retaining  under a  Central Government on  which  the  Rulers are represented the general control of finance and  of other matters ofcommon interest, will in  course of time  make  the State  Govein-ments responsible for their own domestic services.   But the question as to  when or how effect  should be given tosuch  a  policy  is a matter for serious  consideration, because thefeeling  is  widely prevalent  in Malaya  that the Government aremaking too  many  proposals  for  changes  at the same time;  andthere is a strong   feeling  amongst  the  business community  that.with  the  slump in the  rubber and  tin industries, the  present  isan inopportune time to choose for making  changes in  the system ofgovernment under  which the Federated Malay  States reached thezenith of  their prosperity.   To those who argue on  these lines 1suggest that it was  the abnormal development of the tin and rubberindustries which was responsible for the prosperity of recent yearsrather than the actual form of government.  I agree,  however, thatthe present is an unfortunate time to effect any drastic changes.  I  suggest, therefore, that  from the financial point of view any changes should for  the time being be strictly limited to those whichwill tend at once to check extravagant  expenditure and  strengthe;ithe financial position of the Federated Malay States.   Towards the close of the year 1936 it may be possible to reducedebt charges by the conversion of the  6  per cent. Sterling Loan.By this time also the financial position  ought,  with rigid economy. to have greatly improved.   In the circumstances I submit that from a financial point of view  three to four  years would appear to be a suitable period to  fix for  what might be  called the first stage of a decentralization policy.   The  proposals and changes which I think might  reasonably be said to come under the category of those which would help to check extravagant expenditure are :        (a) The proposals  made  by the  High Commissioner at  the      Sri Menanti Durbar in August, 1931, for putting  certain spenil-     ing departmentst under State control.  This change has already      been suggested as desirable from a political point of view.   *  This Advisory Council is not in any way intended to take the place ot the  Federal  Council which will continue to  deal  with those matters which remain federal.   t  For lists of  Departments, vide page 10.
      (b)  The proposal of the High Commissioner to have only five    volumes of Estimates instead  of six and to dispense  with the    volume  of  Estimates entitled &quot; Unreserved  Services &quot;, the    services now shown in that volume  being included in  future in    either the Federal volume or  one of the State volumes,  with    an appropriate note  concerning those about which there  may    still be some doubt as to their final allocation.      (c)  A change from the  present system of &quot;  Supplementary    Estimates &quot; :  because although it  may not directly  affect  a    policy of decentralization  there appear to be  strong grounds    for drastically reducing the  number  and amount  of  ;these    Estimates.  xVs regards  (a)  I recommend that during the next four yearsrevenue should continue to be collected and appropriated by theFederal Government, and that the Federal Council should vote a block grant  to each State to meet the sum  total of the cost of theservices administered by  the  State.  For the  reasons mentionedabove this arrangement should  tend to economy.  As regards (6)  about  half the total expenditure  in recent years has been for &quot; Unreserved Services &quot; and to meet this no revenuehas been  set  aside in that particular  volume of  the Estimates.Indeed, owing to  the complicated method  of preparing  the  Esti-mates and the elaborate  accounts  that have had to be kept by theTreasury, it has not been possible to show any  correlation betweenrevenue and expenditure  in the Estimates in  their present form,and I suggest that they might well be misleading to anyone withouta good deal  of inside knowledge.  The possible result may have been that, when under consideration,the Estimates have not  been  subjected  to  the degree of  criticism that they have deserved; and it has been suggested to me that it isonly such a  state of affairs that could have made it  possible for theexpenditure  of the Federated  Malay  States to  have been on suchan extravagant scale as it has been since the War.  I suggest  that the changes proposed by  the High commissioner in the arrangement of the Estimates  cannot  but  help  to  checkextravagance.  As regards (c), I realize that the question of Supplementary Votesis not directly relevant to the  question of decentralization.  Since,however, I  have  suggested the changes outlined above partly for political reasons and partly with a view to checking extravagance,I think it well to  mention that &quot; Supplementary Votes &quot; seem tohave been too freely resorted to in the past.  With good estimatingfew, if indeed  any, such Votes should be necessary.  I suggest  that the second stage of financial devolution (i.e., afterthe four-year period)  may well include  arrangements for the col-lection and  appropriation by the  States of certain of the revenueswhich  are not required  for  federal purposes,  the  object of this being to make the State Governments increasingly  independentas regards their State services  but at the same time still dependent
on the Federal Government voting money to balance their budgets.if necessary, or to meet such special or extraordinary expenditure ascannot be met from their own resources.  The subsequent  stages of financial devolution might  cover thetransfer of other sources of revenue and the right to  impose taxa-tion so as to put the States in a position to meet all their expenditurewithout subvention from central resources.  As regards the final stages of financial devolution and the divisionof revenue between Central and State authorities, it has been sug-gested to me  that  all revenues  should  be collected by the Statesand  that the Central authority should be financed by  contributions from the  State Governments.   All precedents show that the betterplan and  the one least  likely to  cause friction  is the collection andappropriation of certain revenues by  the Central authority.  Thereare, in my opinion, strong grounds for doing this in the case of theFederated Malay  States  and  fot  appropriating to  the  Centralauthority  such revenues in this  way as will be  sufficient (i)  for theservice of the debt, (ii) for meeting the recurrent expenses of theCentral authority and,  (iii)  for  the building up  of an ample reserve fund.  All the above  suggestions are subject to the essential necessityof not allowing  the financial stability and credit of the federation to be impaired in any  way in  the course of decentralization ; and,in addition to  certain safeguards with a view to effecting  thisobject,  the High  Commissioner must  retain  his  power  to  vetoexpenditure which he  does not  approve,  and also the power in exceptional cases to insist  on  a State  Government providing forsuch services as  he may  consider necessary.  The normal safeguards might include :        (a) The  appointment  of  the  Federal   Treasurer  to  be  a     Member of each State Council.       (6)  The submission  for  the concurrence of the High  Com-     missioner of State  estimates before  they are submitted to  State     Councils.       (c) An instruction  to Residents that they are to work in the     closest touch with the Federal  Treasurer; and that any case     of disagreement  must  at once be referred to the High  Com-     missioner.       (d) No State loan to be  raised without the  sanction of the     Federal Council.   To summarise, I am of the opinion that there is a strong case on financial grounds for some measure of decentralization,  and  I recom-mend  the following proposals:        (a)  During the first  stage extending over a  period  of  about     four years,  the transfer to  State control of certain departments     (already recommended as  desirable on political grounds, vide     page 14) ; with a block grant to  each State to be voted by the     Federal Council each year to meet the sum total of the cost     of the departments so transferred.
                                                                   157                              19      (b)  During the second stage the collection and appropriation    by the States of certain of the revenues which are not required    for federal purposes with a view to making the State Govern-    ments increasingly independent.      (c)  During the final stages the transfer to the States of other    sources of  revenue and the right to impose taxation so as to    put the States in a position to meet all their expenditure with-    out subvention from central resources.      ((/) During  the process of  decentralization there will  be    certain questions which as regards detailed administration can    with convenience and economy  be left  to  State Governments,    but which as  regards policy  will have to  remain subject to a    a common control. An Advisory Council* under the presidency    of the High Commissioner and on which the State Govern-    ments are represented  should be set up  to deal with those    questions from the point of view of a common policy.  In addition to the  foregoing I recommend on general grounds thefollowing  two  proposals which are not necessarily connected withdecentralization.      (c)  The  High Commissioners proposal  for  the  abolition of    the volume of Estimates entitled &quot; Unreserved  Services.&quot;      (/)  A change  in the present system of Supplementary  Esti-    mates with a view to reducing the number and amount of such    Estimates.                         CHAPTER V.      Administrative aspects of  decentralization proposals.  One thing has  stood out  perhaps more than any  other in the controversy that has taken place in recent years over the proposalto adopt a policy of decentralization in the Federated  Malay States,and that is the strong opposition to the  proposed  abolition of thepost of Chief   Secretary.  Without  exception  the  representatives  of  the  business  com-munities  and   of  the  unofficial  members,  together  with  a  largenumber of  officials, take the  view  that the  post should not be abolished  unless it is intended to  substitute  for the  Chief Secre-tary some senior officer,  not necessarily  with the same  extensivepowers, who will (i) reside at the seat of  the Federal Government,(ii)  be responsible  for  assisting the High Commissioner in  co-ordinating policy on questions which remain  federal,  and (iii) beaccessible to representatives  of the public.  It is argued that so long as there are certain questions whichnecessitate a unified policy  it  would be  impossible  for  the  HighCommissioner  to  carry   out  the work  of  co-ordination  himselfwithout the assistance of some such officer.  On the other hand there are many who advocate the retentionof the post of Chief Secretary on  other grounds  and argue thatit is essential  to have a  senior officer at  Kuala Lumpur  who can,* See footnote on page 16.
as it has  been actually put  to me,  &quot; fight  the battles  of theFederated  Malay  States against the High Commissioner and theColonial authorities at Singapore.&quot;  These people are inclined toforget that the abolition of the post as it exists to-day is an essential part of any  policy of  decentralization, and  at the same time to overlook the  fact  that  there  is no intention  of dispensing withthe  appointment  until the policy  of  decentralization has beencarried  to  such a  stage that  the  greater  part of the duties and powers  of the post as it is  to-day will have been transferred.  Onlyactual experience will  show when this state of affairs is likely tobe reached.  As another argument against the adoption of a policy of decentrali-zation,  it has been suggested to me that  the State  governments have not yet had sufficient  administrative  experience to  justifyany  considerable  delegation of power.   I suggest that, although this may be  a reason  for the  very  gradual  carrying out of a policyof decentralization, it  is not an argument for  rejecting such a policyaltogether.   Moreover the  State Councils have recently been con-siderably strengthened by the addition  of  new members includingunofficials, and  as I  have already mentioned it is  the  intentionof the  High  Commissioner to invite the  Rulers to appoint  boththe  Legal Adviser and the  Federal Treasurer  of  the federated malay  States to be unofficial members of  their State Councils.   In any  case,  the general question of policy must,  I submit bedecided on broad  grounds  of political and economic expediency andmust not depend on the retention  or otherwise of some particularappointment  in the administrative  machine  or on the efficiency ofany particular  administration.  For the reasons I have mentionedin the two preceding Chapters I  am of opinion that there are strong political and  economic reasons for deciding to carry out now a con-siderable measure of devolution in the existing system of governmentin the  Federated Malay States, and as I have stated, the eventual abolition of  the post of Chief Secretary as it exists  to-day  must be an essential  part of any such policy.   The  proposal referred to in Chapter Vin* to set up a Malayan Establishment  Office cannot be said to be a measure of decentraliza- tion   It is, however,  a  change which cannot  but  directly  affect any general reorganization of staffs; and I  suggest that,  so far as possible, effect should be given  during  the initial period to the proposals of the High Commissioner for setting up this Office.   I personally  agree with the view which is  almost universally held in Malaya that if a decentralization policy is approved the day is u long way off, if  it ever arrives, before an executive  head of what remains of the federal machine at  Kuala Lumpur can be dispensed with  altogether,  and that it  would  be impossible for the  High Commissioner  to do the necessary co-ordination himself.* Vide page 30.
  It was for this reason that I had  intended  to recommend thesubstitution of a &quot; Federal  Secretary &quot;  for  the  existing &quot; chief secretary &quot; in a few years  time when,  with the progress  of de-centralization, the importance of the  latter appointment will pro-bably have dwindled to that of an executive  head of a  very much smaller federal machine than the one that exists to-day.   Such a post might, I think, be filled by an officer of lower rank and drawingconsiderably  less emoluments  than the existing  Chief Secretary.The nomenclature  of  &quot; Federal Secretary &quot; would  in my viewemphasize  the fact that his  duties, as compared with those of thepresent Chief Secretary, would be strictly confined to dealing with matters which still remained federal.   The High  Commissioner,with whom I discussed the  matter before leaving Malaya,  would much  prefer,  however, that  the title of the post should  continueto be  that of Chief Secretary, so long  as it is necessary to havean officer acting as executive head of  what remains of the existingfederal machine.   I  do not attach great importance to  the title of the post, and I am prepared to accept the High Commissioner&apos;view provided that :        (a) It can be made clear  to the Rulers that the functions    of (he post  will  be strictly confined to that of  an executive    head of the federal machine and to dealing with purely  federal    matters,  and that its importance from  the  point  of view  of    responsibilities, functions,  and emoluments  is  very  different    from what it is to-day.       (b)  It is considered fair to ask an officer to accept the post    with no change in the nomenclature  and with a salary which    will not enable him to maintain the same position, or entertain    on the same scale, as  the Chief Secretary of  to-day.  I am not prepared to say  whether it  will  ever be practicable to dispense altogether  with  what remains of the existing  federalmachinery  and its executive head,  as  this  will depend  on  the setting up  of some new central machinery for dealing with mattersof interest  to Malaya  as a whole and the absorption into it of whatthen remains  of the existing federal machinery.  The officers of the Departments which it is  proposed to decentral-ize are for the most  part  opposed to the proposal to  transfer thecontrol of these Departments to State Governments. They argue :         (a) That  the proposals will result in loss of efficiency owing    to  the central  executive control  being  done  away with; and    that the  powers of visiting  and  inspection  which are to  be    retained as one of  the  functions of  the Departmental Head    will be a poor substitute for the  unrestricted power that they    have now to issue orders to their subordinates.       (b)  That difficulties  will  arise as  regards  the question  of    the transfer of officers from  one State to another.       (c) That the interests of the officers in the  Departments will    suffer.
      (d) That  in  the case of the Medical  Service, it is contrary    to all  modern  ideas to put  the  Medical and Health Services    in a State under one Head.While sympathizing  with  the natural desire of  Heads of Depart-ments to retain  their present control  over their Departments, 1suggest that we  must not lose sight of the political aspect of thequestion and the natural desire of the State Governments to controltheir  own services.  Although I do not agree that with the  will  to  make the pro-posed system a  success there need be any great loss of  efficiency,1 take the view  that, even if there is some such loss of  efficiency.it will be the lesser of two evils, and I cannot believe that in theevent of this happening it will not be possible to find a remedy.  In  this connexion, I was interested to hear the  view expressed that the officers  of Departments have themselves  partly to blame forthe desire  on the part of State Governments for the adoption of adecentralization policy, since in the past the officers of the Depart -ments have in their zeal to carry out their duties been accustomed to visit  States  without informing  the  State Governments, or  evenpaying  the usual courtesies to the Rulers.  The need for working in the closest touch  with the State Govern-ments  will be  stronger than ever in the  future  because  as theresult of the recent  enlargement of  the State Councils  the viewsheld  by the local authorities as to what may he termed &quot; federalinterference  &quot; will not remain inarticulate.  The proposals for the decentralization of Departments  are brieflydescribed in Appendix V.  It  will be observed that the proposals for the  future organisationof the Medical and Public Works Departments differ from those forthe  other  Departments.   In  the  Medical  and  Public  WorksDepartments the  &quot; Director  Adviser &quot;  will  possess   executive authority  in the   Colony  only, whereas  it  is   intended   thatthe Heads of the other Departments shall be vested by the Rulerwith  executive  authority in each of the Federated States.   The  distinctive treatment of the latter group  can be justified byreasons of economy and practical convenience.  In the large staffs of  the  Medical  and Public Works  Departments   there are manyofficers available with ripe experience of an administrative character to qualify  them to  exercise the chief  executive control in  the several States.  In the other Departments it  is desirable that  the  Head of  the  Department  himself  should  be  vested   with  the  chief executive  power.   To summarize, I am of opinion        (a)  That the  abolition of the post of  Chief Secretary as it     exists  to-day, with  his wide  statutory  and administrative      powers, is  an  essential part of any policy of decentralization.
       (b) That there is  no strong  objection on administrative    grounds to the measures of  decentralization which I have re-    commended in the two preceding Chapters, and that the carry-    ing out of these measures will automatically result in relieving    the  Chief Secretary  of  the  more important  functions of  the    post as it exists to-day, thus making it possible to replace him    as head of what remains of the federal machinery by an officer    of considerably less status.       (c) That it is not possible at the present time to say whether    it will ever be practicable to dispense altogether with what re-    mains of the existing federal machinery and its executive  head,    because this  will depend on the setting up of some new central    machinery for dealing with matters of interest to  Malaya as a    whole into which what then  remains of the existing machinery    can  be absorbed.       (d) That the  statutory and administrative  powers  exercised    by the present  Chief Secretary  should be transferred to the    Rulers in Council in the case of State matters, and to the High    Commissioner or the appropriate federal  officers&quot; in the case    of matters which are to remain federal.       (e) That so far as possible, effect  should be given to the pro-    posal referred to in Chapter  VIII, to set up a Malayan Estab -    lishment Office.                         CHAPTER VI.   Suggested procedure in carrying out the policy recommended.   There is without doubt a strong feeling amongst a large number of the community, both official and unofficial,  that there has in the last year or two  been a tendency to try  to redress too quickly any previous delay in implementing promises made to the Rulers.   During my tour in Mala37a it  has  been brought home to  me:        (a) That the  view  is widely held that due regard has not    been paid to public opinion and the necessity  of keeping those    interested informed  of the  actual  meaning  of  the changes    proposed.       (6)  That the proposals made up to date have created an  atmo-    sphere of  suspicion  and misapprehension  as  to  the intentions    of the Government.       (c) That practically everyone whom I met, officials and un-    officials, and the Rulers, take the view that the Government are    trying to carry  out  too many changes at once, and  that if a    policy of decentralization is  to be adopted it  should be carried    out  very gradually.       (d) That there is  a strong feeling  that the  interests con-    cerned are not consulted by  Government before decisions are    taken  and that consequently certain aspects  of the question    are ignored.  * The term &quot; federal officers &quot; includes the  officer  referred to in (6)  at the top of the page who is to replace the Chief Secretary.
      (e) That there are many who feel that owing to the slump    in trade a more inopportune time than  the  present could not    have been chosen for proposing changes in the system of govern-    ment to which everyone is accustomed.      (/)  That some people view  with  such mistrust what  they    call  the proposals  for  centralization in Singapore&apos; that  they    advocate the creation of two separate posts,  viz.,  one of High    Commissioner at Kuala Liumpur and another of Governor (or    Administrator) at Singapore.      (g) That there is a certain amount of feeling over the  com-    comparisons which have been made between the present financial    position of the Unfederated States and  that of the Federated    States,  and that such  comparisons  are  regarded  as  unfair in    view  of the benefits which it  is said the Unfederated States    have received in the past at the expense of the Federated States.  I think it most  essential  therefore, that if a policy of decentrali-zation is approved, the steps  to  give effect to it should be  carriedout very gradually, or as the  Sultan of Selangor advocated to me,step by  step.  Various suggestions have been made  to me as to the  length of period over  which the carrying out of a policy of decentralizationshould be spread, and  these have varied from as much as five to twenty-five  years.  Everyone will I think agree that,  in changing from a highly cen-tralized form of  government  such  as  that which exists  to-day atKuala Lumpur, much  must  depend on the experience gained inthe actual working of  each change, and I  am  of opinion  that  itwould be unwise to do more at the present time than to suggest the changes which might be made in the next few years and to visualizegenerally the further changes that may then be found  desirable.Indeed  I am of opinion that it would be premature at the  presenttime  to attempt to dogmatize as to  :       (a) The exact powers that can eventually be transferred  to    State control.      (b) When,  and how it will be found  desirable  to revise the    existing Treaties and  Agreements.  Assuming that  the proposals I have made for giving effect to  adecentralization policy are approved, I visualize the position  in three to four years time as follows :        (a) The control  of  the following Departments, viz.,  Agri-     cultural,   Co-operative,   Educational,  Electrical,  Forestry,     Medical,  Mining,   Public Works,  Veterinary,  Prisons, and    Drainage  and Irrigation,  will have been handed over to the     State Governments, and  the expenditure incurred on them will     be met by a  block grant to be  voted each year by the  Federal     Council to meet the sum total of the expenditure on the De-     partments so transferred.
160     (6)  The  High  Commissioner  will be in  the same  position   vis-a-vis the  Governments of the  Federated States as regards   the transferred Departments as he is now in with the  Govern-   ments of the Dnfederated States on similar questions  and will   himself deal  through a Secretary  with matters affecting  those   Departments with the Resident  in each State.     (c)  Any  matters transferred  to  State control such  as the   standard of health on estates which as regards detailed  adminis-   tration can with convenience and  economy be left  to  State   Governments but as regards policy  will have to remain under   a common control, will  be  dealt with from the point of view   of a common policy by an &quot; Advisory Council &quot; presided over   by  the High Commissioner  and on which  the State  Govern-   ments are represented.      (d)  The statutory and administrative powers exercised by the    present Chief Secretary will have been transferred to the Rulers    in Council in the case of State matters, and to the High Com-    missioner  or appropriate federal officers  (including the officer    who  has by  then replaced the present Chief Secretary) in the    case of matters which are to remain federal.      (e) The officer who has replaced  the Chief Secretary will be    the executive head of the Federal Government but his functions,    duties, and powers will be reduced to dealing with such matters    as it is decided must remain federal.      (/) The  re-arrangement  of the Estimates  will  have  taken    place.  The  volume now entitled  &quot; Unreserved Services&quot; will    have disappeared and there  will be five instead of six volumes    of Estimates.      (g) A Malayan Establishment  Office will have been set up.      (h) A change  will have been  made  in the system of Supple-    nientary Estimates with a view  to reducing  the number and    amounts of such Estimates.  Any changes which are not directly connected with the transferof the control of the Departments whose decentralization  is  now recommended  should be deferred for the time being, and  I suggestthat this rule should also apply to any changes  which might appearto the Rulers of the Unfederated  States as an attempt to  bring them into any form of closer union,  because I have already called attention  to the  fact that some of them made  it quite clear to methat they would not look with favour at the  present time on any move in  this direction.   I cannot but feel, however, that in  courseof time and when these Rulers fully realize  that there  is  no in-tention of pressing them to agree to any constitutional change, theywill be the first  to recognize the great advantages that will  accrue to their States, and  to Malaya as a whole, by  the creation of suit-able machinery  for discussion of, and, if agreed, the administrationof matters of common interest.
  So  far as it is  possible now to visualize generally  the  changessubsequent to the first period of three to four years they  might include :        (a) As  suggested in  Chapter IV, the  collection and appro-    priation by the States of certain of the revenues which are not    required  for  federal  purposes with  a view  to making them    increasingly  independent.       (b)  The transfer to the State Governments of other sources of    revenue and  the right to impose taxation  so as to put them in a    position to meet  all their expenditure without subvention from    central resources, leaving  the Central Authority to collect and    appropriate such  revenues as will be sufficient for (i) the service    of the debt,  (ii)  meeting recurrent  expenses for federal pur-    poses and, (iii) building up  an ample reserve fund.       (c)  The ultimate abolition of the existing federal machinery    and  its executive head.   This however depends on the setting    up of  some new  central machinery for dealing with matters of    common interest to Malaya  as a whole and the absorption into    it of what then remains of the existing federal machinery.                        CHAPTER VII.                Non-Malay Asiatic Communities.  It has been suggested to me  that the future  treatment of thepeople of non-Malay  origin has  no direct bearing on  the  questionof the decentralization proposals.  This may be  true to a certain extent, but, while I  was in Malaya, I have had the opportunityof meeting representatives of the communities concerned  and theyhave  left me under no illusion as to the anxiety which they feel.This  anxiety, as I  have pointed out  in Chapter III,  must  beregarded as one of the political aspects of the proposals to transferconsiderable powers from the  Federal to the State Governments.  The population of the Federated Malay States is comprised of:                                                        Per cent.    Malays  (including  all  indigenous  peoples  of  the      Peninsula  and  Archipelago)   ...    ...     ...    ...  34.7    Chinese    ...    ...    ...    ...    ...     ...    ....   41.&amp;    Indians    ...    ...    ...    ...     ...     ...     ...   22.2    Others    .....................   1.6  It will  be seen, therefore, that the Chinese  and  Indians formthe major part of the population.  According, however, to the  Census Report, the number of theChinese population which has  been for a long time in the countryis relatively very  small  and the number of  those  who were bornthere  and  expect to  end their  days there is smaller still.  TheReport also states that the same is true of the Indian immigrant,so that the number of non-Malays who have adopted Malaya as
their home is only a very small proportion of the whole populationof the territory, and the increase that is taking place in this numberis hardly appreciable.   That  the  people  who  come  under  this category  form only a small proportion  of the total population mustnot, however,  be allowed to affect the  way in which they are treated;  and indeed,  when I have explained in detail the causeof their  anxiety, I think it will be agreed that the smaller their numbers the more easy will  it be  to ensure that they  receive fairplay.   Those who have  been  born  in  Malaya  themselves, or  whosechildren  have been born there, call attention to  the fact that theyhave acquired great interests in the land of their adoption and have contributed in no small degree to its prosperous development.   they state  that in a great many cases those concerned have never seen the land of  their origin and they claim that their children and theircliildren&apos;s children  should have  fair treatment.   That the anxiety of  these communities has increased  of lateappears to be due to :        (a) The cry of  Malaya for  the  Malays which has recently    been heard much more than  in  previous years.       (6) The proposals  expounded by the High Commissioner at    Sri  Menauti for transferring considerable powers to the State    Governments,  and the fear  that  the  reduction of the powers    of the Chief Secretary will expose  them to discrimination, since    they appear to regard this  officer as their protector  against    any unfair  treatment by  the State Governments.       (c) The  fact that the progress of  education amongst the    Malays has resulted in more appointments in the Government    services being  given to  Malays than  previously.       (d) The fact that  the alienation of so much land in recent    years for the development of  the  rubber and other industries    has  led to a longer view  being taken  of the land needs of the    Malays : and a correspondingly greater use of the Governments    powers under  the Malay Lands  Reservation Enactment.   Because of the facts mentioned in  (c) and (d) above, the non-Malay communities are inclined to the view that the Governmenthave  adopted a new policy.   This is  not  so, since for some years past the Federated Malay States Government have recognized  theclaims of the  Malays to preferential  treatment in the matter  ofappointments in  the  Public Service  and  to  the reservation  ofsuitable  and sufficient land for their  needs.  Indeed some  of thenon-Malay  gentlemen whom  I met went  so far as expressing theview  that  this  was in  their  opinion not  unreasonable  in  the territories of the Malay Rulers; but w-hat they appear to object tois discrimination in principle  and the  extension of the preferential treatment  to immigrant Malays from the Dutch Archipelago whoare  Dutch  subjects.   Some  of  them would,  I think, willinglysupport a policy of fair chance.
  The non-Malays who have  made  Malaya the country  of  their adoption, form  a  loyal section of the community and it has beenthe policy of  the  Government to accord  full recognition  to  theirstatus as British subjects (in the case of those born in the Colony iand  British protected persons (in the  case of  those  born in the malay States).  No one will deny the important part that the non-Malays whohave  made  Malaya their  home  have  played in its  development.and  the share  they are  destined to  take in  helping  its  futureprogress, and 1 think that for this reason  alone they are entitledto an assurance that their interests will  not be allowed  to sufferas the result  of effect being given to a policy of decentralization.Moreover,  subject to  the policy  of preferential employment of qualified Malays in the Government Services,  and the reservation of sufficient lands  for Malay needs, I take  the view that the personsborn  in  the  Malay States of non-Malay parents (although onlyBritish  protected  persons) should be  treated  in those States inexactly the  same way as persons born  in  the Colony of non-Malayparents (who  are  73ritish subjects) and  should have  the same pro-fessional and  business opportunities  as  European British  subjects.  I  should  record that some  of  the representatives  of the non-Malay communities whom I  met  raised  questions in  connexionwith  educational facilities, representation  in the Councils and inother public bodies, the restriction of alien immigration and  so on.I had to explain  that these were matters not  directly relevant tothe  decentralization  proposals,  but that  I  would  bring  the irrepresentations  to  the  notice of  the Governor  and High Commis-sioner, which I subsequently did.                        CHAPTER  VIII.  Miscellaneous proposals not affecting decentralization in the                    Federated Malay  States.  I propose to  deal briefly in this Chapter with certain proposalswhich,  though  not affecting  a policy  of decentralization in theFederated Malay  States,  have inevitably  become associated withthe proposals  made by  the High Commissioner at the  Sri  MenantiDurbar* and  in  some instances were  in fact included in his announcement on  that occasion.          Railways; Posts, Telegraphs, and Telephones.  Both of  these Departments are at present federal;  and  at theSri Menanti  Durbar the  High  Commissioner  explained  his  pro-posals for  putting them under a single  central management onwhich each of the Governments interested would be represented.* Hold in August, 1931.
                         (i) Railways.  The railways  throughout the  Peninsula  are owned  by  theFederated Malay  States Government except in the case of Johore,where, under a revised Agreement  only  concluded  very recently,the Government  of  Johore has undertaken to  lease the railwaythrough the State to the Federated Malay States Government at apeppercorn rent.  In return Johore  is to be entitled to a share inany railway profits  without any obligation to contribute  towardsany losses  that may  be  incurred.   The scheme explained  by theHigh  Commissioner  at Sri Menanti contemplates :       (a) The  control of  the  railways by  an  Executive  Board,    which  is to  be  created in  addition  to the  existing Advisory    Board, in  order to  give a  share  in the control of policy to    the Colony and to each of the  States served by the railways.      (6) The  acceptance by  the  Governments of the Colony and    of the  Unfederated States concerned of a portion of the liability    in respect of  the capital cost of the railways.  This is to be done    in consideration of  the  advantages that have accrued to them    in the past from the construction  and operation of the  railway    by the Federated Malay States.  The Federated Malay States Railway, in common with many other railways  throughout  the  world,  no longer shows  a sufficientprofit to  provide for  a return on  the capital invested; and it  appearsto me more than questionable  whether in the circumstances anycondition such as that  mentioned in  (b)  above is  likely to prove acceptable  to the Governments concerned.             (ii) Posts,  Telegraphs, and Telephones.   The proposals for the re-organization  of  the service of posts,telegraphs, and telephones  contemplate:        (a)  The creation  of a  Postal  Union for the  Colony,  the     Federated States and any of the Unfederated States which may     elect to come into the  Union.       (b)  The control  of the activities of the Union by a Board     under the Chairmanship of  a  Director-General of Posts  and     Telegraphs  and including  representatives  of the Colony  and     each of the  participating States together with  official  and un-     official members to be nominated  by the High Commissioner.       (c)  The issue by  each of the Governments belonging to the     Union of  its own  distinctive  postage  stamp,  subject to the     Regulations  of  the  &quot; Universal Postal  Union  of the World &quot;     which require, inter alia, the design of all stamps of any postal     administration  to  bear an indication,  as  far  as  possible in     Roman characters,  of the country of origin, which in this case     would be &quot;  MALAYA.&quot;
       (d) Legalizing the use of the stamps of the different Govern-     ments belonging to the Malayan Postal Union throughout the     administrative areas of the participating States ; the revenue and     expenditure being  apportioned between the Governments con-     cerned on an agreed basis.  Before I left Malaya I was led  to believe that it  is intended toform a Postal Union  comprising  the  Colony  and the  FederatedStates  without  delay  and  that the  question of  the  participa-tion  of the  Unfederated States  was  not   to  be  allowed  to delay the formation  of the Union.  I  suggest that this is wise,and I feel  sure that, when the Pulers of these States realize thatthe  creation of  a Postal Union for Malaya,  as a  whole,  cannot but be the most economical and efficient method of organizing thispublic service, they will decide to co-operate.                           Customs.  The four States comprising the Federated  Malay  States forma Customs Union  and  the Customs Department is a federal unit;and there is no intention of any measure of decentralization withinthe federation.  Both the Unfederated States and the Federated States have, asthe  result  of the Ottawa  Conference,  granted certain  additionalpreferences on British goods.  The Colony has always  adhered to  a policy  of free trade,  but has nevertheless imposed a few duties most of which give preference to British goods.   There is a strong body of opinion which is appre-hensive that some change may be made which they argue wouldbe  disastrous to the  Colony.    The matter is  a very complicatedone, and I  have assured those concerned  that they need  not  beafraid of any change being approved unless the Secretary of state is quite satisfied that it will not be to the serious detriment of theinterests of  the Colony.  The tariffs in  the Unfederated  States are  not uniform and a customs Union for the whole of Malaya could only be agreed afterconsiderable negotiations with these States.  The possibility of  forming  a wider Customs  Union than existsto-day is still under examination by the local  authorities.  One committee  has  already reported on certain aspects of  thequestion, the report of  a second committee is awaited, and a thirdcommittee  has  just been appointed to consider questions relevant to the trade of the Colony.  It would not be practicable or desirableto offer an opinion on  the matter until the facts are available.                 Malayan  Establishment Office.  The present organization of the Malayan Services is inheritedfrom the  days of  separate and distinct services for the  Colonyon  the  one hand  and  the  Federated States on the other.   The
Unfederated  States have  never,  except  in  respect  of certainisolated appointments, developed European services of their own and their European staff has been seconded from the establishmentof the Straits Settlements, or from the joint Federal Establishment.  This system which allows of one member of a Malayan Servicebeing on one establishment and another on a separate establish-ment,  has  not conduced  to  efficient and  smooth working  or tocontentment  within the services.  There appear to  he strong grounds in the interests  of  efficiency and  smooth  working for  adopting a scheme  which  will put  all european officers in the same position, and bring the FederatedStates, the Unfederated States, and the Colony into line as regardsthe supply of European officers; and thereby eliminate the anomaliesattendant on the present  system of seconding.  It is  proposed :        (a) To create a single Malayan establishment on which all     European personnel will  be borne.       (b) To set  up a Malayan  Establishment  Office in  charge     of an Establishment Officer who will work under the direction     of an Establishment  Board representative of  the  interests of     the Colony, the Federated States, and the  Unfederated  States.       (c) To arrange if  possible for  an agreement between the     Colony,  the  Federated  States, and the  Unfederated   States     under which all agree to employ a  specified number of officers     in each  of the Malayan Services and jointly and  severally to     accept  liability for recruitment charges,  salaries,  pensions,     passage  and  leave expenses,  etc., and  for  the  cost  of the     Establishment Office.   It is obvious  that a large  amount of detailed  negotiations will be necessary between  the different  Administrations   before such an Office as that proposed can be set up, and I understand that theproposals are now under consideration.     Reorganization of the Supreme Courts of the Colony and                   the  Federated Malay States.   The Supreme  Court of the  Colony  is constituted by Ordinance- and exercises within the  Colony jurisdiction and authority  to an extent similar to  that of His  Majesty&apos;s High Court of Justice in England.  As the Court of Appeal it also has appellate jurisdic- tion.   The Supreme Court of  the Federated Malay States is constituted by a Courts Enactment of the Federal Legislature and  comprises the Court of Appeal and  Judges&apos;  Courts.   There is at  present  a  Judge resident in each  of the  Federated States except Pahang, where Assizes are held from time to time.   Under a Colonial Ordinance the Judges of the  Federated Malay States are, subject to  the possession of the necessaiy professional qualifications, Judges ex officio of the Supreme Court of the  Colony,.
and under a Federal Enactment the Puisne Judges of the Colony.but not the  Chief Justice,  are  Supernumerary Judges of  theFederated  Malay States.  The Governor and  High Commissioner has proposed  that  the separate entity  of  the several Federated  States  should  be recog-nised by  constituting  a High Court of Justice for each State totake the place of the present Judges&apos;  Courts.   He  further pro-poses that in  order to promote  co-operation and  the fullest use ofthe available judicial strength a single  Supreme  Court of Malayashould  be created  having  jurisdiction  over  the  Colony and  theFederated  Malay States  with a single  Chief Justice  at  its  head.This  Supreme Court would comprise a High Court of Justice inthe Colony (replacing the  present  Supreme Court in its originaljurisdiction),  the State High Courts, and a Court of Appeal havingjurisdiction to hear appeals from all the  High Courts.  If the Unfederated  States  were  to elect to  use  the services of the  Court of Appeal its jurisdiction could be extended accordingly.  It is  not necessary  in  this  Report to give more than  the  abovebrief  outline  of the scheme which  is under  consideration.  I found that  there  was an important conflict  of opinion in theFederated Malay States  as to the  desirability of creating a  singleSupreme  Court with  one Chief Justice for  both the Colony  andthe Federated Malay States, and I  promised to bring to  the  noticeof the Secretary of State the representations made to me by the bar Committee of the Federated   Malay  States.  Both politicaland administrative  objections  have been urged against the proposal and these  will certainly require the fullest examination before anychange is approved.  I am aware,  however, of no  such substantial  objections to theChief Justice of the  Colony  being empowered to  sit as a  judge in  the  Federated  Malay States;  and,  at the time  when  I  leftMalaya, the  High Commissioner contemplated getting the consentof the Rulers to the necessary amendment of  the Federal Enact-ment to permit of  this, and had decided  to  leave for further con-sideration  the larger scheme  which has no  direct  bearing on thedecentralization proposals proper.                 Secretariat for Chinese  Affairs.  For the last twelve  years there have  been  two separate appoiut-ments of  &quot; Secretary for  Chinese Affairs &quot; one in the Colony andone in  the Federated  Malay  States.  With a view to  ensuring a  uniform  policy  throughout Malayain  relation to Chinese  immigration  and  the  control of Chinesealiens,  the Governor  and  High Commissioner  has  proposed thecreation of a single  appointment of &quot; Secretary for Chinese Affairs &quot;instead of the two existing appointments.  Up to date the  Secre-taries have not exercised any direct authority  over the  Protectorsof Chinese in the Unfederated States,  but from time to time the
active assistance of the Secretary at Singapore has been sought bythe State authorities when important questions have arisen, becausethe High Commissioner  on behalf of His  Majesty&apos;s Governmentis responsible for the ultimate control of Chinese policy throughoutMalaya.  The new  proposal contemplates a change, therefore, in so far asit provides  for  putting the &quot; Secretary for  Chinese Affairs &quot;  inthe same position  as  the existing &quot;  Controller of Labour &quot;* and making him the executive officer responsible to the High Commis-sioner for the  control of  the Protectors  of  Chinese throughoutMalaya.  It has been suggested  that  the  proposed  pan-Malayan Secretaryfor Chinese Affairs should reside at Singapore, since  it is the chiefpoint  of  Chinese  immigration  and  the chief centre of Chineseactivity in Malaya.  I understand that  this suggestion has led tocriticisms by  the authorities in the Malay  States  who, as already indicated in this Report,  are generally apprehensive of any element of  administrative  control from  Singapore,  since  it  is contendedby  them that the  interests  of the Malay States are not the sameas those of  the  Colony.  Again there is a further reason,  viz., the fear of the  strong  influence that  the  Chinese community at singapore-pore may exercise.  I suggest that these apprehensions  are at least exaggerated and Ihave no fears that  the interests of the Malay States would be over-looked if the proposed organisation  is adopted.   The question  isone, however, on which  all the authorities concerned will have tobe  consulted, and I cannot but feel that when each Government hasbeen shown  that  the proposed  scheme makes full  provision forthe consideration of their own particular views there ought to beno difficulty in  getting them  to acquiesce Tin its adoption.                         CHAPTER IX.         Summary of  Conclusions and Recommendations.                         CONCLUSIONS.   (i)  From the purely economic point  of view, it would  no doubt be advisable in a country the  size of Malaya  to  have a  singleGovernment  administering  the  whole territory.  * The duties of the &quot; Controller of  Labour &quot;, who is of pan-Malayan status,are mainly concerned with the control of Indian immigration and of the terms and conditions of employment of Indians throughout the Peninsula: and incarrying  out these  duties he acts  as the chief adviser and agent of theGovernor  and High Commissioner in dealing with various political questionswhich arise from the presence of  such a large Indian community  in Malaya.As the greater part of the Indian labour employed in Malaya is working inthe Federated Malay States, the Controller of  Labour  resides at the FederalHeadquarters at Kuala Lumpur.
   (ii) There is,  however, a political aspect of the problem,  andthere can be no  question that the events of recent years have en-couraged the  Mulay  Rulers to believe that it is  the  intention ofHis  Majesty&apos;s Government to arrange for a transfer  to the StateGovernments  of  more control  of their own  affairs.   (iii) The creation  of a highly centralized bureaucracy at KualaLumpur has been undoubtedly one of the main causes of the requeston the part of the Malay  Rulers for decentralization.   (iv) The maintenance of the  position, authority,  and prestige of the Malay Rulers must always be a  cardinal  point in british policy, and the encouragement of  indirect rule will probably prove the greatest safeguard against the political submersion of the Malays-which would result from the development of popular government on western  lines.   (v) Prom a political and financial point of view, there is a strong case for adopting  a policy of decentralization and  for gradually-substituting in the Federated Malay- States a genuine federal system for what has  been  described by  the High Commissioner as the&quot; amalgamation  &quot;  that exists to-day.   (vi) There is  no strong objection  on  administrative grounds toa policy of  decentralization.   (vii)  The closer assimdation of the position of the Rulers of theFederated  Malay States  to that of the Rulers of the UnfederatedMalay States is  obviously an  essential  preliminary to any schemefor promoting co-operation between the constituent parts of Malayaas a whole on matters of common interest.   (viii)  Although, as I  pointed  out to  the Rulers of Johore andKedah, there is no intention of requiring any  Unfederated State toenter against its will into a scheme of closer union, the Bulers ofthe  Unfederated States  appear nervous  that  some policy of thiskind is in  contemplation, and it  is evident that they  would be re-luctant at the present time to agree to any closer form of co-operationthan there is to-day.   At the same time I think the Rulers would allagree that there must be many questions on which joint discussioncould not but be of advantage to every constituent part of Malaya.   (ix)  Time and experience alone will show  (a) to what  extent  itwall be possible to assimilate the positions of the two sets of Rulers.and (b)  whether some system of  periodical Durbars for discussingquestions of common interest can be arranged.   (x) The  non-Malay  Asiatic   communities  feel   considerable anxiety as to the extent to which their interests may be affected bythe  adoption  of  a policy  of decentralizatiion.   (xi)  The recent addition to the State  Councils in the federated malay States of  unofficial members is likely to strengthen the desire of the State Governments for more control of their own affairs.   (xii) Any changes made in  the mutual relationship of the Federaland State  authorities must not be such as to  weaken  that essentialpolitical association  and  joint financial  responsibility on which the
prosperity of the Federated Malay  States has been built up, andthere can be no question of purchasing political devolution at theprice of financial dissolution.  The general control of finance must remain, therefore,  in  the hands of a central authority, on whichthe Kulers are represented.   (xiii) From the  point of view of checking extravagant expendi-turc, there  seems  to  be much  to  be said  for  handing  over  thecontrol of the &quot; spending departments &quot; to the State Governments.   (xiv) It is argued that the State  Governments have not yet had sufficient  administrative  experience  to  justify  any considerabledelegation of powers.  Though  this may be a reason for proceed-ing  slowly,  it does not  appear to be  a  strong  argument for  notadopting a policy of decentralization at all.   (xv) It is argued that the transfer to State  control of certain services will result  in  loss of efficiency and  administrative difficul-ties  in dealing with   the personnel  of the  departments affected.With the will to make the new system a success, there need not beany  great loss of efficiency.   If  there is  it can probably  be reme-died, and  in any case, everything points to  its being the lesser oftwo  evils.   (xvi) The abolition of  the post of  Chief Secretary, as it exists to-day, must be  an essential  part  of  any policy of decentralization,since there  can be  no place in any such scheme for an  officer atthe head of the Central Government  holding  such wide  statutoryand  administrative  powers  as this officer does to-day.   (xvii) The representatives  of  the business communities and ofthe unofficial members are strongly  opposed  to the  abolition of thepost of Chief  Secretary, but I  think  that  they, together with  alarge number of officials who likewise fear its abolition, would not feel  as strongly as  they  do about the matter if it  were the inten-tion to substitute in the place of the  Chief  Secretary an  officer of reduced status who  could act as the executive head of what remains of the administrative  machinery  for dealing with federal affairs.   (xviii)  So long as  there are certain questions which  have to  bedealt with by the federal machinery-, it seems likely that it will benecessary  to have  an executive head  of what  remains  of  thatmachine,  and I agree  with  those who take the view that it wouldbe impossible for the  High Commissioner to do the necessary co-ordination himself.  (xix) The view is prevalent amongst  members  of the businesscommunities in  the Federated  Malay States  that, owing  to  theclash of interests between  those States  and the Colony,  the  im-portance  of  having  a senior officer at Kuala Lumpur who will  beavailable  to  look after the interests  of the Federated Malay Statescannot be overestimated.   (xx) The  view is  widely held that due  regard  has not been paid to the  necessity  of educating  public opinion  as to what theproposed changes actually mean,  with the result that an atmosphere of  suspicion and  misapprehension as  to  the  intentions of  the
Government has  been  created.  The Rulers, Officials,  and  un-officials almost without  exception take the view  that the Goveru-ment have been proposing too many  changes at  once, and  that iia policy of decentralization is to be adopted it should be carried outvery gradually, step by step.  (xxi)  There is a strong feeling that the interests concerned arenot consulted by Government before decisions are taken, and thatconsequently certain aspects of  the  question  are ignored.  (xxii) The view is widely held that owing  to the slump in tradeand  the urgent necessity for considering retrenchment  the  time is an inopportune  one for carrying out any material changes in tin-system  of government to which everyone is  accustomed.  (xxiii) Some people view with such mistrust what they call  pro-posals  for centralization  in  Singapore,  that they advocate  theestablishment of two separate posts, one of High Commissioner atKuala Lumpur,  and  another of Governor  (or  Administrator) at singapore.  (xxiv) A  certain  amount  of feeling  is  shown about the  coin-comparisons which have been made between the financial position to-day  of  the  Unfederated States and that  of  the  Federated  States.Such comparisons are  regarded as  unfair in view of  the benefits which it is said that the Unfederated States have received in thepast  at the exjiense of the  Federated States.  (xxv) Time and experience alone will  show to what  extent de-centralization  can  be  carried  and  to  what extent  it  will hepracticable  to  assimilate  the  positions  of the  Rulers  of  theFederated and Unfederated  States; and  it would be unwise at thepresent time to attempt to dogmatize as to what can be done afterthe  first period  of four years.   (xxvi) As in the  case of all  bureaucracies,  there has  been atendency for that at Kuala  Lumpur to get more  power  into itshands year by year, and for the number of experts  to grow andgrow.   (xxvii) If the proposals for decentralization are approved a greater proportion  of the time and  attention of the Governor and  HighCommissioner is likely to be taken  up with matters concerning the Malay States, and it will probably be necessary for him to spendmore time  in those States than has  been the custom in the  past.   (xxviii) Various views are held as to the length of period over which  the  carrying  out of  a policy  of  decentralization should bespread, and these vary from as much as five to twenty-five years.   (xxix)  It is not necessary or desirable to consider the revision ofthe. Treaties and  Agreements until  experience has shown what areto  be  the  eventual relations  between the  State  and  Federal authorities.   This is not likely  to be for some considerable time.   (xxx) Too great importance should not be attached to uniformity in  details and no undue pressure should be  brought to bear on the Rulers of the  Unfederated  Malay  States to  conform  to  what is being done elsewhere unless as regards essential matters.
  (xxxi)  In changing  from a highly centralized  form of Govern-nient, such as that which exists to-day at Kuala Lumpur, it is onlythe experience gained  in the actual  working of each  change whichwill show at what pace the process should proceed.  (xxxii) A period  of  about four years seems a reasonable one toallow  for rearranging the financial  relationship of the Federal and state  Governments on a satisfactory basis, and  also for strengthen-being generally the financial  position of the Federated Malay States;and the first stage of decentralization might with advantage corre-spond with  this period.                    RECOMMENDATIONS.  I am of  opinion:        (a) That a  definite policy   of  decentralization  should  be    adopted forthwith.       (6) That the changes  involved  by the  adoption of such a    policy  should be carried out very gradually.       (c) That  the first stage of  such a policy should cover a    period  of about four  years, corresponding with  the  time  re-    quired for rearranging the financial relationship of the Federal    and State Governments on a more satisfactory basis than it is    to-day and for strengthening generally the  financial position of    the Federated Malay  States.       (d) That during the first stage the decentralization measures    should  be strictly  limited to the following :-           (i) The  transfer to State control of the  following De-         partments,  namely Agricultural,  Co-operative,  Educa-         tional,   Electrical,  Forestry,  Mining,  Medical,  Public         Works, Veterinary,  Prisons, and Drainage and Irrigation ;         with a block grant to each State  to be voted by the Federal         Council each  year to meet the sum total of the cost of the         Departments so transferred.           (ii)  The  setting up  of  an  &quot; Advisory  Council &quot; pre-         sided over  by the High  Commissioner and  including  re-         presentatives  of the  State  Governments, to deal  from the         point of view of a common policy with questions which as         regards  detailed administration  can for convenience and         economy be left to the State Governments, but as regards         policy will  have to remain under a common control.            (iii)  The transfer of the statutory and  administrative         powers  exercised  by the  present Chief Secretary  to the         Rulers in Council in respect  of those matters which are         transferred to  State control,  and to  the  High  Commis-         sioner or appropriate Federal Officers (including the officer         who is to replace the present Chief Secretary) in respect         of those matters which are  to remain federal.
  (e) That  during the  first  stage  of decentralization effect should also be given to the following proposals, which are not,however,  directly  connected  with decentralization:-       (i) The abolition of the volume of  Estimates entitled     &quot; Unreserved Services &quot;.       (ii) The setting up of a Malayan Establishment Office.       (Hi) A  change in the  system of Supplementary Esti-     mates with a view to reducing the number and amounts     of such Estimates.  (/) That it  would be  unwise to  try to lay down precisely what further changes  can be made  in  the  direction  of decent-tralization subsequent to the first stage referred to above (since this  must depend on experience)  but that they  might in-clude:        (i)  During the second stage the collection and appropria-     tion by the States of certain of the revenues which are not     required for federal  purposes, with a view to making the     State Governments increasingly independent. .       (ii)  During the final stages  the transfer to the States     of other sources of revenue, and the right to impose taxa-     tion so as to put them  in a position  to meet all their.     expenditure  without subvention  from  central resources,     leaving the central authority to collect and appropriate such     revenues as will be  sufficient for the service of the debt;     meeting the  recurrent expenses of the  central authority;     and building up an ample reserve fund.       (iii) Ultimately the abolition of what remains of the     existing  federal  machinery and of its executive head.     This, however,  depends on the setting up  of some new     central machinery for dealing with matters  of interest to     Malaya as a whole and the absorption into it of what then     remains of the existing  federal machinery.  (g) That the question of the revision of the treaties and agree-ments with the Malay States is not urgent and  should be re-garded as a matter for the future.

The  group of territories which  has come to be  known  as Malaya corn-prises  (a) the three  Settlements of Penang, Malacca, and Singapore, which,with the Settlement  of  Labuan off the  coast  of  Borneo,  constitute  theColony of  the Straits Settlements;  (h)  nine Malay States, each  with itsMalay Ruler, and each  in treaty relations with the British authority by virtue  of which their States are placed under British protection.  Of these nine States four came under British  protection in the course ofthe years  1874-18S9, viz., Peralk,  Selangor, Negri  Sembilan, and  Pahang.They   subsequently  in 1895  concluded  an Agreement  constituting their countries into a Federation  to be  administered under  the advice of  theBritish Government.  These four States  are known  as tho  Federated Malay-States.  The five  States which  are not  included  in the Federation  areKedah,  Kelantan,  Trengganu, Perlis,  and Johore.   Tiie  first  four, which
lie  between the  Fcdoratcd Malay States and  Siain, came definitely  under british protection  in 1909  when Siam  transferred  to Great Britain  herrights over those territories.  Tho fifth,  Johore,  in  the south  of the  MalayPeninsula, had by  a Treaty of  1885 confided the control of its foreignaffairs to the  caro  of Great Britain, but  it  was not  until  1914  that  anAgreement was  concluded (with the Sultan, under which a British  officerwas appointed as General Adviser with authority similar  in extent to thatpossessed  by  the  British Advisers  in tho  other  Unfederated Malay  States.  The total  area of the Malay  Peninsula  is  approximately  60,000 square miles of which the  Colony of tho  Straits Settlements accounts for  not morethan  1,144  square  miles,  but  to  the  total   Peninsula  population  ofapproximately 4,350,000  the  Colony contributes 1,100,000 and in  the  two great ports of Singapore  and Penang lie tho main channels of international trade  and communication, not only  with  tho Peninsula  but also betweenEurope and the  Par East.  Of the  total population of Malaya the Malays  (including for this purposeall  indigenous peoples of the Malay,  Peninsula and  Archipelago)  are by nsmall margin the largest  element  numbering 1,962,000 or 45 per cent.  The Chinese  number   over 1,700,000  or  39 per  cent.   They  constitutenearly 60  per cent, of the population of tho  Colony  of the Straits Settle-ments, and they form tho most  numerous race in the  Federated  States ofPerak, Selangor, and Negri  Sembilan as well as in the Unfederated Stateof Joliore. In the other States they  form a numerically far less important element of the population and fall to a minimum of 5 per cent, in Kelantan.  The Indians in iMalaya number 624,000 or over 14  per  cent, of tho total population, and  are concentrated chiefly in the Federated States  of Perak,Selangor,  and Negri  Sembilan,  and  in  the Settlements  of Singapore  anilPonang,  and  in  the State of Johore.  In general, it is  true  to say that  the bulk  of  the Chinese and Indians.like the  Europeans, go  to Malay not to make it their home, but in thehope of making a living  and possibly amassing wealth with which  to returnto  their  native lands.  The main  occupation  of  the majority of the  population  is agriculture.In  the Report of the 1931 census  it was estimated that  probably one-fifth of  the working  population  was  engaged in rice cultivation.  The rubbercultivation  industry was estimated  to  occupy  probably one-third of  theworking  population, while tin  mining,  which is from the economic pointof  view  the  other  most  important producing  industry,  employed  no morethan 4 per cent.                             APPENDIX  III.                        Treaty of  Federation, 1895.  Agreement  between the Governor of the  Straits Settlements, acting onbehalf of the Government of Her Majesty  the -Queen, Empress of  India.and  the Rulers  of the following  Afalay  States: that  is  to say, Perak.Selangor, Pahang, and  the  Negri Sembilan.      (1) In  confirmation of  various  previous  Agreements,  the Sultan of    Perak,  the  Sultan of Selangor,  the Sultan of Pahang, and the  Chiefs    of the  States which  form the territory  known as  the Negri Sembilan.    hereby  severally  place themselves and their States  under the protection    of the British Government.      (2) The  abo%&apos;e-named   Rulers  and  Chiefs  of  the  respective  States    hereby  agree to  constitute their countries  a Federation, to be  known    as the  Protected Malay  States,  to be  administered  under  the  advice    of the  British Government.
      (3) It is to  bo understood  that the  arrangoment hereby agreed  upon    does not  imply  that any one Ruler or  Chief  shall  exercise any  power    or authority  in  respect of any  State other than that  which he  now    possesses in the  State of which ho is the recognized Ruler or Chief.      (4) The above-named  Rulers agreo  to  accept a British Officer, to be    styled  the Resident-General,  as  tho   agent  and representative  of the    British Government  under the  Governor of  tho  Straits  Settlements.    They  undertake to  provide  hirn  with  suitable  accommodation,  with    such salary as  is determined  by Her Majesty&apos;s Government, and to    follow  his advice in all matters of  administration  other  than  those    touching tho Mohammadan religion.

Summary of Proposals&quot; of High Commissioner for Decentralizing                              Departments.(i) Agriculture, Drainage a7id  Irrigation, Education, Electricity,  Forestry,                    Mining, Prisons, and Veterinary.  The  arrangement that is proposed for decentralizing the  above Depart-ments is designed to meet tho case of those Departments of which the senior officer stationed in each State is of comparatively junior rank.   Under thisarrangement      (a) The Head of the Department is to be styled. &quot; Adviser.&quot;  * The proposals  explained  in  this Appendix differ in some respects fromthose adumbrated by the High Commissioner at the  Sri  Menanti Durbar in1931; o.g.,  the Drainage and Irrigation Department at  that  time  was partof tho Public Works Department and the Prisons Department was  not mentioned.
      (b)  Tho Adviscr&apos;s powers as a federal  officer in respect of the various    States aro to  bo advisory and inspectoral only,  his executive powers    being confined  to federal property and institutions.      (c) Tho Adviser is to  have executive authority in  the various State,.    but to dorive it from each State Government and  not from tho Fedora!    Government  as at  present; the authority being vested in  tho Adviser    personally by written warrant from each  Stato Government  under the    hand  of  the  Ruler  in Council.      (d)  Tho word &quot; Deputy &quot; is to bo  placed before the title of  tho senior    officers of these Departments stationed in each Stato in cases  whore the    existing  title denotes independent charge, so  as to  make  it  clear that    the Adviser is  himself the chief oxectitive officer.      (c) Tho Adviser  as the chief executive officer is to be  responsible to    the State and  not to tho Federal Government for all executive action    taken by his Department in the State.      (/) The Adviser (in his federal advisory capacity) is to retain the right    to initiate  correspondence with both tho Federal  and Stato Govern-    ments on any  matters  affecting the activities or  policy of his Depart-    mont.      (ff)  As- Advisers the Heads of these Departments are to retain all tin-    powers  of visiting and  inspection within tho  Federated  Malay States    that they now  possess.   The  consent of  each  Stato Government to such    visits will be general, and all that a  visiting Head need do is  to apprise    the State Secretariats in good time of such visits.  The Adviser will take    pains to make  tho  personal acquaintance of  each Ruler.                     (ii) Public  Works  and Medical.  The arrangement for the decentralization of  these two Departments differs from that proposed for the  other Departments in so far as it docs not in-cludo tho retention of executive functions in the  Federated  Malay states by the Head of  the Department.  The proposals provide for: -      (a)  The abolition of the particular posts of Director of Public Works,    and Principal Medical Officer, Federated Malay States.      (b)  The creation of the appointments  of &quot; Director of Public Works.    Straits  Settlements,  and Adviser on Public Works, Malay States,&quot;  and    &quot; Director of  Medical  and  Health  Services,  Straits Settlements,  and    Adviser  on   Medical and Health  Services, Malay States.&quot;   The head-    quarters of  these officers will be at Singapore.  The  duties of  each of the  &quot; Director-Advisers &quot;  in so  far as concerns the malay States will be amongst other things to supervise European  personnel.to effect the transfer of officers after consultation with  the administrationsconcerned, to pay periodic visits of inspection to each State and  report theresult  to the Government concerned, to  give advice on any matter referredto him by the Head of his Department in a  State or by a State Governmentand keep the State Governments concerned  informed of  any interesting de-velopments  in other States,  to compile  a  manual of instructions on purelyprofessional  or technical (as distinct from administrative)  matters,  and toensure the proper  administration of joint  institutions.(1S385-2) Wt. 25355-2935  1625 3/33 P.
