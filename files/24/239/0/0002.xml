THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  March 1933.Copy No.  45CABINET.THE CEISIS IN  EUROPE.     1  TOLD  the Cabinet  on Wednesday that,  in view  of the increasing deterioration  in  European  relations and  the  prospect of the collapse  of the Disarmament Conference, I felt it necessary to invite my colleagues&apos; immediate and special attention  to the crisis which  seems  to  be last approaching.  The following paper,  which has been  prepared in  consultation  with Sir  Robert Vansittart,  gives an outline of the difficulties which are coming to a head, and estimates the dangers that may follow if we cannot evade them.     2.  What  is happening  is not some sudden  and unexpected  change in the health of Europe, but  rather the rapid advance of a disease,  the seeds  of which have been growing below the surface for a long  time. Sir Robert vansittart&apos;s Surveys of International Relations in 1930 and in 1931 were followed by  a further Survey, dated the 1st  January, 1932, in which he pointed out that, in spite of some lip-service to a League of Nations already  losing ground and to  a higher standard of international conduct, most Governments were still inspired by the motives and were employing the  methods which had led the world  into war in 1914.   The view expounded  was that, now that the Disarmament Conference had been  prematurely  summoned to meet,  it was necessary at the very least to ensure that its probable failure should not accelerate  this downward course.     3.  The first year of the Disarmament  Conference^ life has shown that such apprehensions were well-founded.  There have  been  occasional spurts of energy and long periods of lethargy : in spite of all our efforts, there is next to nothing- done which justifies hope of a successful conclusion.  This sort of thing cannot go on much longer.  It is the opinion of most careful judges that by Easter at latest the fate of the conference will be sealed one way or another.     Meanwhile,  during 1932,  the  state  of the world  has  gone from- bad to worse.   There are  wars going  on in  all  but  name between Japan and China,  Bolivia and  Paraguay,  Colombia and  Peru.    Though  no  outbreak has  yet  occurred in  Europe,  sabre-rattling as  a habit  is  increasing.    Next Sunday will show whether  Hitler can get a working parliamentary majority. Whether  he  does or  not,  his militant,  very  dangerous  and  incompetent administration will remain in charge of the  centre of Europe in strict training for mischief.  Signor Mussolini, who seemed a year ago to  have entirely dropped the unprofitable bellicose note  and  to be disposed to some genuine measure  of disarmament, has now  reverted  to the policy of  fishing in the  troubled waters of Central Europe and has recently adopted an openly provocative attitude towards Yugoslavia.   Sir  Ronald Graham reports from Rome that &quot; a spark in present circumstances would be enough  to precipitate a general explosion.&quot;  Mussolini&apos;s relations with  Hitler  are  close;  his relations with Combos, the Hungarian dictator (another dangerous incompetent), equally close.  The recent arms incident at Hirtenberg is  a reminder, if any were needed, that the Italian  Government is playing the  dangerous game of  arming its  ex-enemies against  its  ex-allieswith a view  to  encircling and disintegrating  Yugoslavia.   The recent treaty forunifying the foreign  policy of the  three  members  of  the  Little Entente  is significant on the other side. Europe has continued without interruption the ten-dency, evident three years ago and now becoming more crystallised, of falling into      6776   [8293]SECRET.CP.  52 (33).
antagonistic armed groups.  Meanwhile economic depression continues unabated;the  volume of  world trade  diminishes;  and  everywhere unemployment  and uncertainty of livelihood are on the increase.     4.  Turning again to the Disarmament Conference, it would be difficult to exaggerate the gloom which prevails there.   No agreement has yet been reached on  any important subject.  Even such questions as the abolition of chemical warfare, to which practically the whole world has long been pledged in principle,have not yet been incorporated in  agreed articles.  Qualitative and quantitativedisarmament are alike held  up.  No agreement has been reached  as to the types of arms which are to be prohibited  or reduced, no agreement  as to even themethod by which numbers of effectives and war material are to be limited.     5.  Unless  there  is to be  a  change  of method and a  new impetus theConference is  doomed.  What, then, will be the situation which faces us ?  HereI  would  call  particular  attention  to the  attitude  of Germany.   On  the11th December the five Great Powers signed an agreement assuring to Germanyequality of rights in a convention which would provide security  for all nations.Supposing there is  no convention and the Conference  is either dissolved oradjourned indefinitely?  Germany will  claim that it is the fault of others  andnot of herself (for she is already &quot; disarmed &quot;) that no convention has been concluded. Other Powers, she will  say, have failed in the pledges which on several occasions  they have given to her  that  her disarmament at Versailles was thepreliminary to their own.  The other Powers have promised to her equality oftreatment.  If there is to be no convention, then, in the  German  view, she musthave this equality outside any convention.  In any case, she will say the militaryarticles of the Treaty of Versailles are morally dead (and whatever  Germanydoes, Hungary or Bulgaria may be expected to do the same, with immediate effecton the Little  Entente).  Hitler  will not be content with protestations;  he  will proceed to action.  It is not hard to guess what form the rearmament of germany will take.   Germany cannot afford  the many millions  of pounds required tobuild an adequate number of warships to make her formidable at sea.  She may,however, start on submarines.   On land  the Hitler Government will probablybegin on  the  formation of  a large  army,  based on both the  voluntary  and compulsory  system.  But they  are likely  to rely for their military power  stillmore on the mechanised weapons of the future, such  as tanks, big guns  (herfactories are all ready for this), and,  above all, military aircraft.  The appoint-ment of Captain Goering as Air  Minister is an earnest of this. Aviation, inparticular, offers to  Germany the  quickest and easiest way of making her  ownpower effective.   With her  vast industrial system and her already flouaishingcivil aviation, she  will  have no  difficulty  and  no insurmountable expense inproceeding promptly to the  creation of  one of the leading air forces of Europe.The move will be popular  in Germany, for it involves little sacrifice  to thepopulation as  a whole, and,  at relatively little expense, provides striking careersfor numbers of the  &apos;&apos; patriotic &apos;&apos; youth.  Aviation is the field above all others inwhich Germany could attempt  with  some hope  of  success to  catch -up  Francewithout undue delay.  Against military aircraft the extensive fortifications ofthe French frontier cannot avail.  France&apos;s  reply to this menace would of course be  prompt.    She has already  extensive  plans,  if  the  Conference fails, for increasing enormously  the  size and efficiency  of her air  forces.   Intensivecompetition in armaments will  almost  certainly begin  in Europe, and,  indeed,throughout  the world, with its inevitable accompaniment of  the excitement of civilian populations, who must  be organised and drilled in preparation for air bombardment  and gas attack.  In such an atmosphere, even if peace is nominallypreserved,  political  relations  will  rapidly  deteriorate yet  further.   Therestoration of political confidence, on which all the economic ias well as politicalexperts insist, will  be postponed to the  Greek Kalends.  In such an atmospherethe World Economic Conference  would have a  poor chance  of  -producing any useful result.  In such an atmosphere what trade barriers will come down, whatGovernments  will extend the much-needed  credits to Central Europe?  It  willbe an atmosphere of hostility, if not hostilities, which will militate with full force against that financial and economic recovery which is essential not only to peacebut to the very existence of civilisation.  And the number of years for which realhostilities can be staved off  would, in all European opinion, be doubtful.
     6.  Such a prospect is serious enough perhaps no prospect could be more serious but we must, in addition, realise that if there is a breakdown at Genevapart of the blame will, however undeservedly, be put upon us. A list will be madeof the instances  in which we have resisted proposals put forward by others, theacceptance of which, it will be suggested, would have made all the difference. the role of Great Britain at Geneva  is to be the whipping boy and the comment isquite unfair.  But it will be. made, in Europe, in America, and among a sectionof our own people.  It would be something gained if we could,  even in the dyingagonies of the Conference, take a position which would silence the captious critics.     7.  The main point, however, is not that if  the Conference breaks down weshall be blamed for it, but that if the Conference breaks down we shall have to face the consequence of intensive competition in armaments in Europe, especiallyin the air,  and intensification of all the leading  political  controversies between france and Germany,  between Germany  and Poland, between  Italy  and Yugo-slavia, between France and Italy, and others.   In such conditions political andeconomic confidence  will  wane to vanishing point;  economic   nationalism willbecome even more rampant; there  will be,  therefore, a long setback to the hope ofeconomic revival; and the consequent reaction on our relations with  the UnitedStates is bound  to be  serious.    For our  own taxpayers there will  be burdensnecessitated by reconsidering our own safety.  We should have to prepare for thepossibility, if not of a war of defence, at least for an armed  neutrality. It wouldbe essential that our relations with France should be of the closest kind, and ifwe cannot be friends with both France and Germany, we shall end by having tobe friends with France alone, keeping in with the U.S.A. as far as we can.   Anyco-operation  there would be handicapped for a period  by a  failure  to  settleamicably the  American  debt, or by the  failure of  the  Economic Conference.Political, strategic and economic considerations in favour of  such an alliance with france may thus be compelling. And all this series of disturbing conditions andhampering anxieties appear to me to flow from the breakdown,  under  presentconditions, of the Disarmament Conference.    8.  The question therefore is whether there  is anything more which we can do at Geneva to prevent the breakdown.  It is a very urgent question,  for as soonas the German elections are over on Sunday, it is by no  means  unlikely thatGermany will find a pretext for  withdrawing from the  Conference again and finally; and announce that she is going to pursue her own course as to armaments.We have the  best of reasons for fearing that  that course would lead to there-establishment  of Germany as the armed menace of Europe.   The  French areterrified of this and are in a condition when they would agree to give up much atGeneva if only they could secure Germany&apos;s signature to a  disarmament conven-tion of some sort.  The  efforts made during the last twelve months to discussdisarmament questions one at a time lead nowhere,  except to more  discussion.Is it possible to attempt,, boldly and very  promptly, a new method and put uponthe table a complete  draft convention which we  invite the  others to  accept andwhich, if it is rejected, will stand as an irrefutable proof  that we have, at anyrate, not failed to offer a means of rescue from the consequences  which will followif it is not  accepted ?    9.. Mr.  Eden telegraphed  from Geneva some days  ago that he had  been working there, with others of the British  Delegation, on  a  draft convention forour consideration.  I asked him to return  to this  country with the document, and now that I have  seen it,  I must  put it before the Cabinet without  any delay.The Prime Minister has directed  that the  Ministerial Committee should meet assoon as possible,  first to hear Mr. Eden&apos;s report of the actual situation, and secondly to consider the draft.  In the meantime,  it is circulated with  this paper.    10.  Whether we can save the Disarmament  Conference by some such meansI do not know.  But I do not believe that it can be  saved  by  any other means.Any convention which would have a chance of being accepted  must involve firm proposals as  to air armaments, land war  material, and supervision.   But mostof the suggested convention merely incorporates, in a definite  shape,  matters towhich we have given approval in principle.  So far as any definite conclusioncan be drawn from the present European chaos and we are now being confrontedby a Germany more menacing than pre-war Germany, just as post-war Russia is
omore menacing than pre-war Russia, and post-war Italy more menacing thanpre-war Italy;  while the United States are more impotent than ever we aredrifting.   And I  venture to  recall the  Lord Presidents  words  on  the8th January, 1926 : &quot; Who in Europe does not know that one more war in theWest, and  the civilisation of the ages will fall with as great a shock as that of rome.&quot;  And this warning applies even though we managed ourselves to keepoutside the actual area of conflict.                                                                    J. S.    Foreign Office, February 28, 1933.
