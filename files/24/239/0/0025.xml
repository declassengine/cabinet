1A n        THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3                             GOVERNMENT.                               CABINET *                        ROAD TRAFFIC ACT, 1950.               EXTENT OF APPLICATION OF  SECTION 11 &amp; RELATING                          TO COMPENSATION.3JT.                                                 Copy No.     ;___75(53).          MEMQRAIClUM BY  THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT.                At  the meeting of the Cabinet held on  the 8th March,       1933* when  the above  subject was  considered (C.P*if7(3j3)) *       undertook to  consider the possibility of inserting a provision       in the Bill which would  have the  effect of imposing upon the       Local Authority  concerned an obligation to pay to any  of its       employees affected &quot;by agreements  entered into under Section 105       of the Road Traffic Act,  19^0,  the  same compensation which any       such employees would  be  entitled  to obtain from  the Road Fund       under Section 116 as  it  now standee                 It  is  clear that it was not the  intention of       Parliament, when the  Road Traffic Bill was under consideration,       to impose such a liability upon Local Authorities, and the       question, therefore,  is  whether a defect in the  drafting of the       Bill has created a  new situation  making it necessary to  impose       an additional liability upon Local  Authorities.   As an       alternative to making working and other agreements for the       management, working and  maintenance of transport services under       the enabling  provisions  of Section  105 of  the Road Traffic Act,       Local Authorities may proceed by  way of Private  Bill.   During       the present Session five Private  Bills have in fact &quot;been lodged       by Local Authorities  dealing with a form of co-ordination or       amalgamation  of  the transport undertaking  of the Local       Authority with  that  of a private  company and in  none of  these       Bills has a compensation clause been included, nor have
20th March,  19^5.petitions been lodged in favour of the inclusion  of  such a clause.   I can trace no compensation clause  in previous Acts orOrders relating to the discontinuance or amalgamation of transport services of Local Authorities.    If any title to  compensation isgiven by the Amending Bill the provisions could in practice be avoided by the Local Authorities obtaining the powers by special acts and not under the Road Traffic Act.             I should also point out the anomalies which would arise if on en agreement or amalgpmation the  employees of theLocal Authority could obtain compensation by  Statute, while thoseof the Company which is the other p- rty to the agreement couldnot.             I have, therefore, come to the conclusion that theextension of the scope of the proposed Bill would be bothineffective and anomalous, and I ask for authority to proceed withthe Bill as originally proposed.
