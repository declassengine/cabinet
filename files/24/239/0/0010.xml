Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1933.SECRET.                                                  Copy No.CP. 60  (33).                TO  BE KEPT  UNDER  LOCK  AND KEY.29It is requested that special care may be taken to      ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.PROPOSALS  FOR  INTRODUCING  CERTAIN  CHANG KS   AND    REFORMS  IN  THE  METROPOLITAN  POLICE  FORCE.                  Memorandum  by the  Home  Secretary.    1.  I CIRCULATE for the consideration of the  Cabinet a memorandumby  Lord  Trenchard  submitting  certain  proposals for  the  reform  of  theMetropolitan Police Force.    2.  It will be seen that the reforms advocated by Lord Trenchard are directedpartly to  changes in the administration of  the Force and partly to changes of organisation.  To the former category belong the proposal to provide adequate facilities  for recreation  (which has already  received the assent of the Cabinet),the proposal to terminate the present practice of allowing police officers to be directly employed and paid for their services by private persons, and  the proposalto curtail the  activities of the  Metropolitan Branch  Boards.   To the  othercategory belong the proposals to provide for the direct recruitment of officers andto employ 5,000  constables, or approximately a quarter of the total Force, on short-service engagements  covering a  period of  ten  years.   For  these  last-mentioned proposals legislation will be necessary.*    3.  That reform is needed, and needed urgently, there can be no doubt.  as things now are, discipline in this  Force is bad; discontent  is widespread; espritde corps is  almost entirely lacking;  and the standard of efficiency of the force is far short of what it should be.  If this diagnosis is correct as I believe itto be strong remedies are clearly indicated.  It may be argued in some quarterswhich are not intimately acquainted with the facts that the Metropolitan police are the pattern of what a police force should be, and that, even if certain reformsare desirable, the time is not opportune for the upheaval which Lord  Trenchard&apos;sproposals will create.  But I am satisfied that the application of these remediescannot safely be postponed if we are to be able to rely upon an efficient and loyalpolice force.    4.  It is certain that all these schemes of reform (with the exception of theproposal to provide increased facilities for recreation) will be strenuously resisted by the Metropolitan Branch Boards and by the officials  of  the Police federation as a whole.  But it  is equally certain that many members of the MetropolitanPolice will  welcome  the  reforms, and that  their influence will tell in the finalreckoning.  There may be serious trouble, but I have little doubt that this  can,    *  Legislation will bo required to provide (a) for the compulsory retirement of  constables withgratuity after 10 years&apos; service, and of officers on pension at such ages, not being below the age of 45,as maybe fixed, (A) for increasing the number of Assistant Commissioners, arid (c) for  the exclusion ofthe new officers from membership of the Police Federation.
and will be, avoided if only we are able to convince Parliament and the public ofthe facts of the present situation and of the real intention of the remedies to beapplied.    5.   Public  criticism of the reforms proposed by  the Commissioner will bedirected mainly to  the proposal for  the  direct recruitment  of officers  to  theForce and to the proposed short-service scheme for a proportion of the constables.The scheme  for the recruitment of officers will no doubt  be represented as astep in the direction of militarising the Police Service  and as an anti-democraticscheme based on class interest, but I am confident that we shall be able to dispelany doubt on that  score save from the minds  of those who  are themselves sosteeped in class prejudice  that they see it everywhere whether it exists  or  not.The objection to the short-service  scheme  for constables will be more difficultto meet.  It  will be urged, with great show of reason, on the one hand that  theGovernment, by introducing this scheme, are deliberately setting about to create a new blind  alley employment, even though on  a relatively small scale, and onthe other hand that no such scheme can be introduced without losing the safeguardto good behaviour provided by the contingent prospect of a pension and withoutlosing valuable experience in police duties  which is only to  be obtained from  the prolongation of police service to the normal age for retirement on pension.  Tosuch representations the answer, and I trust the effective  answer, will be thatthere is a wide field of employment  for  which police experience is a specialqualification and that these  police officers, who retire after ten years&apos; service.will be assisted in their search for employment by an Appointments Board which lord Trenchard proposes to set up;  that, however   the  Metropolitan  police force may be organised, there will always  be a large residue of day to day workfor which the physical activity and the mental  alertness of youth  are far moreimportant than length of experience;  and that it may confidently be  expectedthat any loss of the safeguard to good conduct which depends on pensionableconditions of service will be  far more than offset by the all-round improvementin conduct and  efficiency which will  be gained  from the leadership of the newofficer  class.    6.  As regards  the question of expense, I set up a Departmental committee under  the Chairmanship of Sir Warren Fisher, consisting  of  representatives ofthe Treasury, the Home Office, the Government Actuary  and of  the  Receiverfor the Metropolitan Police  to &quot; examine from  the financial point of view  theschemes submitted by the Commissioner, and to frame estimates of the expenditure and savings both in  the initial and final stages.&quot;   I need not trouble the cabinet with the detailed findings of the Committee.   For present purposes it is satis-factory  to know that  the Committee&apos;s conclusion  is that,  even  in  existing conditions no financial considerations exist which should preclude the consider a-tion of Lord Trenchard&apos;s schemes on their intrinsic merits.    If, as I trust,  the Cabinet  decide in favour of  these reforms, it will benecessary to  consider how and at what time  they shall be publicly announced.I  have  now before me the  Report  of  the  Committee appointed under  theChairmanship of Sir George Higgins to consider the rates of pay of new entrants to the rank and file  of the Police Forces of the country. This, I suggest,  shouldbe  disposed  of  before any  announcement  is  made  by the  Government  of  theschemes of  reform for the  Metropolitan Police,  and as  the various localauthorities, the  chief officers  of police and the Police Federation representativesmust  be allowed time for consideration of the  Committee&apos;s recommendationsbefore the matter comes before the Police  Councils for England and Scotland,it is unlikely that a final  decision will have  been reached until shortly beforethe House rises  for Easter.  In the meantime, Lord Trenchard&apos;s Annual Reporton  the Metropolitan Police will be due to be  issued, and this Report  (whichwill be available for publication about the beginning  of April) will provide  a convenient opportunity of placing before the public a preliminary statement ofsome  of the existing defects in the present   system  of  administration  and organisation of the Metropolitan Police Force.   The  way  would thus be clearfor an announcement of the  schemes  for the reform of the Metropolitan Policeshortly after the Easter Recess.

SECRET.ANNEX.PROPOSALS  FOR  INTRODUCING  CERTAIN  CHANGES  AND    REFORMS  IN  THE  METROPOLITAN  POLICE  FORCE.              Memorandum  by the Commissioner of Police.    THE proposals I wish to put forward  fall under four heads: -            I. Officers.           II. Short Service Scheme and Recreational Facilities.          III. Employment of Police  by Private Persons.          IV. The Federation and Branch Boards.                                CHAPTER  I.                                 Officers.    The  Metropolitan Police is a force of  over 20,000 men. responsible for an area of 700 square miles and a population of 8^ millions.   It is ten times the size of any other police force in this country and constitutes more than one-thirdof the total police strength of England and Wales.  These facts alone obviouslyplace it in a category by itself.    In certain fundamental respects its organisation has remained throughoutthe 103 years of its existence without substantial change. When the force was established by Sir Robert Peel in 1829 it was organised as a body of constablesunder the control of Superintendents, Inspectors and Sergeants,  directed fromheadquarters  by two Commissioners of Police (an Army Officer and a barrister).The Superintendents were nearly all Sergeant-Majors from the  Army, and it was laid down by Sir Robert Peel that all appointments up to this rank were to be filled by promotion from below.   By this rule he was guarding against nepotismand jobbery and this was very likely necessary in 1829, but,  in averting theseevils, he  started a system to which may  be attributed  most of  the defects whichhave shown themselves in the Metropolitan Police organisation in the past andwhich still exist at the present time.    The  Police are supposed to be a disciplined force and yet nearly the wholeof the  Metropolitan Police came out on strike in 1918.   There have been three other strikes  and the authorities have been compelled to allow and legalise an organisation  (known  as  the Police Federation,  with Branch Boards  in  everyForce) to enable the men to make representations to the  Secretary of State andthe Commissioner.   Grievances are ventilated through this organisation ratherthan through the officers whose business it should be to prevent  and  remedy them.Discontent and grumbling are widespread.   Esprit de corps  is almost entirelylacking.  There is an atmosphere of suspicion and lack of confidence.  Disciplineis wooden, repressive and unintelligent. The standard  of conduct is low andinstances of actual dishonesty occur at  regular intervals. Occasional instances of individual policemen  who use  their positions for  fraudulent or  corruptpurposes need not  cause  any great anxiety in themselves, but  when it is foundthat a group  of officers have carried on a regular  system  for a long time or thatmalpractices  have been encouraged by gross laxity in supervision,  the questionnaturally arises whether the detected  cases are not merely symptoms of a muchmore widespread disease.    What I have stated in the last paragraph represents, I believe, a fair andunexaggerated statement of the position and it seems obvious that there mustbe some fundamental defect to account for it.   The ordinary causes of discontent
are notably lacking in  the police.  They are well paid; their occupation  is notspecially arduous;  they have security of tenure and they are protected in various ways from the economic anxieties to which most classes of the community are subject.   The elaborate  official  system of  pensions, gratuities  and  medical treatment  is  well  reinforced  by  a  number of police charities, such  as theOrphanage, the Convalescent Home, Relief  Fund, the Widows&apos; Fund, and so on.     But in one respect the police organisation is unique, and it does not require any special insight or a very close study of the problem to  perceive that it is inthis special feature of the police system that the real weakness lies.  I refer tothe fact that, unlike any other comparable organisation, its personnel, includingits officers, is drawn solely from one source.     Time after time in the  last half century attention has been drawn to thisdefect.  It has been referred to in the public press at intervals.  Nearly fifty years ago (1886) a Committee reported in consequence of disclosures in connectionwith a Trafalgar Square riot that &quot; the number of officers  of superior rank and education or of experience in habit of command, was  insufficient.&quot;   The latestauthoritative  reference to the same point was made by  the Royal Commission on police Powers and Procedure  in  1929.   The relevant  paragraph of this  RoyalCommission^ Report states the case so  clearly that I will quote it in full.     They said :          &quot; There is a further factor which we regard as of the first importance      the selection of superior  officers who can  exercise the high  standard of     influence and example on their subordinates without which the Police Service     cannot maintain its prestige  and position.  We have no wish to enter into     discussion of the question as to how far it is desirable that all recruits for     the Police Service should be required to enter at the bottom, in the rank of     Constable.  That is, we  understand, the rule  at  present, apart  from the     posts of  Chief  Constable and  Assistant Chief Constable, which may be filled     by appointments from outside in certain circumstances.  We wish, however,     to endorse the  view which has been put to us in evidence that it is essential     to encourage the entry into the Police of at least a proportion of men whose     attainments  qualify them for positions of considerable  responsibility, and     we consider that this is possible only if the system provides, and is known to     provide,  prospects of rapid advancement for outstanding young men.   Also     we wish  to emphasise that long experience and good  service in the lower     ranks of  the Force are not the only, nor even the most important,  qualifica-     tions for the higher posts, which ought to be filled in all cases by men who,     besides being themselves upright and fair-minded, are capable of impressing     their own standards on their subordinates.  We should therefore regard as     inimical to the public interest any system which limited appointments to the     higher posts to those who had entered  the Police as Constables,  and we are     of  opinion that such posts  should be filled  by  the  best men available.     irrespective of  the source whence they are drawn.  In making this comment     we do not wish in any way to disparage the  qualifications of the  Police     Constable or to create obstacles to  his advancement.&quot;     From an  examination of the list of officers from the Commissioner down tothe Inspector, i.e., those holding ranks corresponding to the commissioned ranks in the Army,  it will be seen      (1) that out of a total of 759, only 11 have been taken from what are usually           called the  &quot; educated  classes &quot;  (and these 11  are, in fact, largely           engaged on purely administrative duties).     (2) that  the existing  system of recruitment seldom produces men fit for the           highest  posts.   In all  the history of the Metropolitan Police Force           only one ranker has ever reached the grade of Assistant Commissioner.           The result is that the Force has to fill its highest  posts by importations           from the Navy, Army, Air  Force, and outside  professions, whereas           it should, of course, not only be able to produce men for its own higher           posts, but be in a position to send well-trained officers to other forces           at home and abroad.     (3) that in order to fill the higher  posts at Scotland Yard, lawyers, soldiers           and police  officers  trained  in  Overseas   Forces  have  had  to  be           brought  in.
    It is impossible to think of any organisation of comparable importance whichdeliberately selects the least-educated class of the community as its sole source ofsupply not only for the lower grades, but for the leaders and organisers up to arank corresponding with that of Battalion Commander in the Army.    The comparison with the Defence Forces is almost too obvious to  mention.In commerce and industry, more and more, large undertakings are looking to the universities, the public schools and the secondary schools for the  &quot; best brains.&quot;In the Civil Service also,  in spite of strong pressure in the other direction, theprinciple  remains and is endorsed  at intervals  by Royal  Commissions  and committees of Inquiry of maintaining a steady inflow of highly educated  mento assume the majority of the most responsible positions.    There is no desire to &quot;close the door&quot;  on  those who have  not  had theadvantage of  a higher education. On the contrary,  the tendency is as it shouldbe to open it wider and wider and to recognise capacity and character from whatever source it may come.  It is, therefore, an essential feature of the schemeI am proposing that, whilst it provides for the introduction of a suitable numberof well-educated men, it at the same time affords opportunities to those who  join the  Force as  Constables if they  possess the right  type of  character  andpersonality to progress more rapidly than they can under the existing system.    The present educational standard of the Force as a whole  is surprisinglylow,  and  the  entrance  examination  is  almost  childish  in  its simplicity.Newspapers periodically refer to university men and public school boys  in policeuniforms, and it may be that an  incorrect impression has thus been created.  Thenumber of such men joining the Force is negligible, and in the MetropolitanPolice the percentage of men possessing a really first-class education is extremelysmall.   Only  18 per cent,  have carried their education beyond  the elementaryschool standard.    The result  is a noticeable narrowness of outlook and rigidity of mind  evenamongst those  who  reach the  higher ranks.  This arises  not merely  fromdeficiencies in original  education (which may be made good  to  some  extent in later life) but also from  associating almost exclusively with others of similar  typeand mentality.    Both in magnitude and in quality the task of the Metropolitan Police hasundergone great changes  in the  last fifty years.    The increased complexity oflegislation, the  improved methods of the modern criminal, the introduction of the motor car and  wireless these and other  similar developments necessitated notonly intelligent and alert Constables, but also and far more important a formof supervision entirely different from that which sufficed in former days.    And it is not only in  the matter of pure efficiency that the need of a radical change  makes itself obvious.   The absence of a leavening of educated men isunquestionably the reason for much of the discontent and lack of esprit de corpsto which I have already referred.  The Constable  should look to his officer notmerely for orders, but also for  inspiration, advice  and sympathy.  He should know as I am afraid he  does not know now that he will get a fair hearing ifhe has a reasonable complaint to make or if he is brought up for  an offence.  Heshould know  that his officer is out to help him in  every possible way to  do hiswork  thoroughly and honestly and takes a real interest in the conditions of hislife when off duty.   The officer should obviously command  obedience, but heshould  also,  by the high  standard  of his own conduct  and by  his  superioreducation, secure the respect, confidence and friendship of his men.    It was the  failure of the present system in these respects that brought aboutthe strikes and the subsequent formation of the Federation and Branch Boards.The authorities recognised, apparently, that the men had genuine grievances andno satisfactory  method of  bringing them to notice.  Instead of realising that thedefect lay in the organisation itself and altering it, they introduced an elaboratesystem of Constables&apos; Boards, Sergeants&apos; Boards and even Inspectors&apos; Boards.    In so doing  they  still  further  weakened such  authority  as the officerspossessed.  They presented the voluble and disgruntled elements  (which exist inevery large body of  men) with  a ready-made legalised, instrument for under-mining discipline and fomenting discontent, and they put the Commissioner inthe position of  having to justify his  decisions to Boards and Committees of mensupposed to be under his disciplined control.    It is  not part of my  purpose to recommend the abolition of the federation and the Branch Boards at the present time.  The state of  affairs which brought
them into existence  is much the same now as it was in 1919.   But if  the realremedy is applied, if the lower ranks are provided with a normal, natural channelthrough which they  can ventilate their grievances, the necessity for maintaining the Federation will eventually, I believe, disappear.     It is obvious, of course, that any scheme for introducing officers of a differenttype into the Force  is going to meet with a great deal of opposition.  It is this fact no doubt  that  has deterred the authorities in the past from  attemping areform  so often advocated.  There will be those who see in it an anti-democraticmove and others who will condemn it as an attempt to fly in the face of a hundred years of history.  But I am convinced that until this problem is squarely  faced,there can be no radical and lasting improvement and that, so far from flying inthe face of  history,  it is accepting the lessons which a hundred years of historyhave  taught.   Furthermore, though the opposition  will no doubt be extremelyvocal and will  come  from many directions, there are good grounds for believing that the person most vitally concerned, i.e., the average policeman, will  welcomeit in  his heart.  He already realises from the little experience he has had ofofficers of the kind now proposed that he will gain a great deal from the change.    The proposals I am making are intended to apply to the Metropolitan  police force only.  This  is essential for  a variety of  reasons.  In the first place, thereis the practical difficulty of devising a  scheme applicable to 181 police  forcesvarying in strength from 11 to 2,054, administered by 181 different authorities ofall political complexions.  The Metropolitan Force is a compact Force under one authority (the Home Secretary), and comprises more than one-third of the  Policestrength of  England and Wales.  When the changes have been in operation for aperiod of years in London, it will be be time enough to consider how far, if  at all,they are applicable elsewhere.    Briefly, the intention is gradually to improve  the  quality of the officers byrecruiting direct into the  Inspector grade.   The  men will be taken from  twosources.  Some will come in by selection (with or without examination, accordingto circumstances) from candidates educated at  secondary schools, public schools and universities.  Others will be chosen from amongst those who have joined theForce as constables.    The men selected will be trained in a college, somewhat similar to Sandhurst,and will be  subjected to various examinations and tests before they are posted asjunior Inspectors.  From this rank they will be  promoted to Inspectorships after two or three years, and will be eligible for further promotion to higher  posts ontheir merits. The normal age for reaching the Superintendent grade will  be about45, and it is calculated that rather less  than 40 per cent, of the entrants should reach this grade.     Some people who have considered the problem have suggested that it  wouldbe sufficient to  bring in a few educated men in the higher positions as Superin-tendents and  perhaps  Chief Inspectors but  I am  fully satisfied that such ascheme  would provide no real solution.  Officers occupying such positions cannot possibly be in real day-to-day touch with their men, as their &apos;&apos; commands &apos;&apos; usuallynumber something like 1,000 of all ranks.  An Inspector has on an average about30 or 40 constables  under him.    He  can, if he is of the  right  type, exercise a constant influence on every individual under him.  As already suggested, it is notmerely  a matter of  getting the work  done correctly.   That can be achieved byanyone  who knows his job and can get himself obeyed.  The officer that is wantedis one who is prepared to be a guide, philosopher and friend to his men ready to listen to their troubles, to watch their interests, to take part in their recreations,and at  the same time, by his own example, to maintain a high standard of duty and keenness.     The point of introduction of the new men will, therefore, be at the Inspectorgrade.   But  the  number  of Inspectors will  be reduced by  about 270,  and anew grade of Sub-Inspector will be introduced.  This will be the highest ranknormally reached by those who join as constables and are not selected for specialpromotion.     Other salient points of the scheme are that the ages at which men  can becompulsorily retired will be lower and there will be some additions to the numberof higher posts.     The rates  of pay I am  suggesting will not be materially different from those now in operation, and I do not anticipate that any difficulties will arise underthis head.
    The question of meeting the legitimate claims of men now in the Force whoseprospects of sceuring promotion may be affected by the  introduction of the newofficers from outside has  been carefully examined.    Those who have already reached the Inspector  grade and those who  have ceased to be eligible in any case for promotion from  their present grade are not affected.  As regards the remainder, it has to be remembered that  the effect of introducing  the new men will be gradual.   For more than two years from theannouncement of the scheme, promotion will continue from the lower ranks at thenormal rate.  Af ter that time it will be slowly retarded as more and more of thehigher posts are occupied by the new type of officer. As an offset  to  this, pro-motion will be accelerated by the increase in the number of higher posts and theearlier ages of retirement.  Also, by way of compensation for any loss of prospectsor retardation of promotion on the normal line, an opportunity is offered which did not exist before of  securing early appointment to Inspectorships.  Underthe present system it takes a Constable at least twelve or thirteen years to reach the Inspector rank.    It is almost impossible to forecast with precision what the  effect of these various  changes will be on  men now serving, but it may  be necessary at  some future time to give special opportunities to a small number of men who may find themselves debarred from promotion, which  they would otherwise have secured,either by reserving a number of vacancies for them or perhaps  by offering themspecial terms of retirement.    In conclusion, I would like to say that I regard this reform as by far the mostimportant of the proposals I am putting forward.  I fully appreciate the serious-ness of it, and I realise that it will be severely criticised, but I am firmly convincedthat real contentment  and efficiency can only be secured  by facing this issue.Though some years must elapse before it becomes fully effective, I believe that thebenefits  to be derived from it will be felt even in the early stages.  There may bea phase during which discontent, jealousy and suspicion will be apparent amongstthose who have been brought up under the old traditions and are distrustful of anyinnovation.   But I am hopeful that this phase will pass rapidly, and I am convinced that a new spirit of emulation and service, a new contentment and anew and better discipline, will soon be produced, and that the future history ofthe Metropolitan  Police  Force  will be one  of  progressive  development and improvement, instead of one of intermittent agitation, mass meetings and strikes.    A detailed explanation  of the scheme that has been worked out for puttingthese proposals into operation is attached (Appendix I).                                CHAPTER  II.                         (a) Short Service Scheme.                         (b) Recreational  Facilities.(a) Short Service Scheme.    It is not generally realised what a large number of Constables are men ofconsiderable age and service.    In order to get his first step in promotion a Constable must pass an examina-tion before he completes eight years&apos; service. If he fails to do this, all chance of promotion is gone.   Some try and fail; others do not try at all.    The result is that in the Metropolitan Force there are about 8,000 Constables,or nearly half the total number in this rank, who have no chance of promotion andnothing to look forward to except their pensions.  At the present time about 4,000of these men have over seventeen years&apos; service, and before long, by the operationof the Pensions  Act, 1921 (which raised the period of service for full pension),the position will become even worse.    It is impossible to expect energy and keenness from men who are sent out day after day and night after night to do the same dreary pedestrian exercise up andclown  the same old streets.  The monotony of the work itself and the hopelessprospect of long years ahead with little or no variation must inevitably crush any initiative that may have existed./
     Crime is increasing, and the modern criminal is usually young and active. Frequently he relies on surprise and speed of movement to enable him to achieve his object and make his escape, and though these developments may be partially met by improved communication and rapid transport, it is also vitally important that the ordinary Constable, who may at any moment find himself called  upon to deal with an  emergency, should be as alert as possible, both in mind and body.     Police work of the ordinary kind is not in itself conducive to activity.  Slow and deliberate  movements  are intentionally cultivated.    In some districts a Constable may carry out his appointed  task for weeks, months and even years without  encountering a single  incident which calls for  rapid thought or action. The result  is inevitably a tendency towards physical and mental lethargy.     The Force depends for its success on  the keenness and initiative of 20,000 individuals, acting more or less independently.  Under the present system far too many of them are not only without any  real incentive to effort, but even with a definite inducement to do as little as possible.   Activity involves the  risk of mistakes and the line of inaction is the line of safety.     The men themselves can hardly be blamed.  The fault is with the system.  As it stands at present it is unfair to the men, and what  is more important it is unfair to the public to ask them to pay for a Force which is carrying a dead weight of inertia and not giving full value in protection and service.     The proposal I wash to put forward for remedying  this state of affairs is to introduce a short-service system for a proportion of the Constables taken  into the Force.     The scheme I have worked out provides that there shall be eventually about 5,000 Constables serving for ten years, at the end of which time they will leave the Force and receive a gratuity.    Apart  from the obvious effect of reducing considerably the average age of the Constable grade, the scheme will also have the advantage of improving the career of the long-service men, by proportionately increasing the number of higher posts available to them.    The first criticism  that will probably be made of the  scheme is that it is a form of blind-alley employment and that, unless vocational training is given,  the men turned away from the Metropolitan  Force at 30 to 35 years of  age will tend to swell the ranks of the unemployed.    The answer to this criticism is that there is a considerable field of  employ-ment as door-keepers, watchmen,  guardians, wardens and messengers, for which these men would be peculiarly suitable.   They will  have been specially  selected for physique and good character and trained to be watchful and resourceful.    At  present  a considerable number  of  policemen secure employment afterleaving  the Service although they are already middle-aged and have a  pension which would  enable them to live  without further employment.  Many of theseopenings should be available to the Short Service police officer, and it should bepossible to persuade some of the numerous employers who now obtain the  servicesof serving police from time to time for various purposes that their  requirementsmight be supplied by the employment either permanently  or temporarily of retiredShort Service men.    I propose to set up an Appointments Board whose business  it will be to approach such employers as well as banks, other business houses, museums, public institutions, &amp;c, in order to secure that at least a proportion of the vacancies theyhave for men of this kind may be reserved for short service constables.  If, in spite of  these arrangements,  a proportion of them have  difficulty  in  findingemployment, I suggest that this consideration is really unimportant in comparison with the increased efficiency of the Force itself.    Again it may be contended that the short service constable with  no promotion to work  for and no pension to look forward to will have no more incentive toeffort than  the old policeman has under the present system.  The first answer to this argiunent is that enterprise and keenness are the natural attributes of youth. and it takes a healthy man a number of years to lapse into habits of slothfulness. With proper  leadership and the stimulus of emulation,  I believe the young man on short service terms will be much more likely to take an interest in  his work and put energy into it than  the man who has  been at it for twenty years or more.    Again, there will  be the very definite incentive of the kind of  work he will get after leaving the Force.   If the Appointments Board functions as it should. it will always have a number of vacancies  or prospective vacancies on its books.
Clearly the men who have given their best to the police will have the first claimto recommendations for the best work outside.   The characters they carry away with them from the Force will be their most valuable asset in after life.    The financial aspects of the scheme are of course of great importance.  Therewill be a large saving eventually in pension charges both for men  and widows.Against this  in the interim period must be set  the liability for gratuities whichwill begin to  materialise a good many years before the pension saving is felt, buton the other hand the savings on pay resulting from the short service scheme willcommence about the same time as the gratuities and largely balance them.  Howfar the increased efficiency which I anticipate in result of  the change will be reflected in a reduction of man-power  is impossible to calculate, but this is a highly important aspect of  the matter which must be taken into  account in estimating costs.    In making my calculations I have had the assistance of the government actuary and a Treasury Committee has  examined the whole problem  from a financial point of view.  Their conclusion was  that &quot;no financial considerationsexist which should preclude the consideration  of the schemes on their intrinsicmerits.&quot;    I attach  as Appendix II a more detailed statement of the manner in whichit is intended that the short service system  should be applied.(b) Recreational Facilities.    I  recently submitted a  memorandum  on this subject (CP. 7  (33))  to theCabinet through the Home Secretary and I understand that approval has alreadybeen  given to the principle of regarding the provision  of recreational facilitiesfor the Metropolitan Force as a proper charge on the Metropolitan Police Fund.    This question need not therefore be considered further at the present time.                               CHAPTER  III.                  Employment of Police by Private Persons.    A system has been in existence in the Metropolitan Force for many years under  which individual police  officers can add  to  their incomes  by acceptingemployment by private persons and companies when off duty.    The practice is peculiar to the Metropolitan Police and does not exist, so faras I can ascertain, in any other  Force in the country.  It started, no doubt, in asmall way, and was an easy and convenient method of  meeting the occasional needsof private persons.  But it has now assumed startling proportions, affecting largenumbers of officers in all divisions, and I have come to the conclusion that it must be definitely stopped, as it is impossible to reconcile it with a proper standard of conduct throughout the Force.    The occasions on which the services of Police are  required  on private premises are various.  They include football matches, greyhound meetings, sales, concerts,bazaars, &amp;c.   Employment is not restricted to the lower ranks or to the UniformForce.   Inspectors and Sergeants  are  frequently employed, and the services ofC.I.D.  officers are also needed to a  considerable extent.    A definite scale of payment is  laid  down, according to the period of time andthe rank of the officers involved.  The money is paid direct to the officers and theyfrequently receive refreshments in  addition.    Police are servants of the State and the Public.   Their remuneration andtheir hours have been laid down by the Government,  and it cannot be possible to add regularly a considerable number of hours to those duties without a grave riskof  the  work  for which they are primarily employed suffering in consequence.Again, when they are employed  &quot; on gratuity,&quot; as it is called,  they are workingas police officers.  In other words, they are selling their services as public servants to private individuals. If an employee  of the Government whether civil servantor  policeman likes to devote his spare energy to writing books or cultivating agarden, no objection can be raised, and if his efforts bring him  some  littleremuneration he is welcome to it, but it  seems to me to be entirely wrong  for apoliceman to be paid by a  private person for acting as a policeman.
    Again, it is only human nature that a man who has an assured income for working a certain prescribed number of hours (into which hours he can put moreor less energy according to his inclination), and who sees opportunities of adding to that  income from other sources, will be liable to concentrate his attention onsecuring the extra amount rather than on giving full value in energy and keennessfor the regular and certain payment which will come to him more or less whateverhe does.    This inevitable conflict  of interest is a real danger in the uniform force, butit is obviously a great deal more dangerous as  regards the C.I.D.   A  C.I.D.officers work cannot be bound by specified hours of duty.  Urgent matters mustbe dealt with at once, and a keen officer is clearly placed in an unfair position if, by carrying out his proper duty conscientiously, he  is  liable to sacrifice  hisopportunity of securing extra remuneration from private sources.   . Another objectionable feature of the system  is  that the  opportunities  forearning money by extra employment vary considerably in different divisions, andthis inequality of distribution may lend itself to a certain amount of abuse.    It cannot be contended that this system of employment and payment is in anyway necessary, since so  far as I can ascertain no other  Police Force in thiscountry follows it.    The ordinary and, as it seems to me, the only proper way of dealing with applications  from private persons and organisations for the services of Police isto detail the  men to attend  as part of their regular duty in normal hours or onovertime, and to charge the full cost of their services.   The moneys so receivedshould be paid into the Police Fund, and no question of special payment to  themen concerned should arise, except that those employed on overtime would be paid the ordinary  rates prescribed in the regulations, unless they were given equivalenttime-off.    It was laid down some years ago that this regular method should be followed in the Metropolitan Force in dealing with race meetings, and  the rule has beenadhered to with one inexplicable exception as regards horse  racing, but it hasnot for some reason been  considered necessary to  apply it to greyhound racing,and this item alone has added very considerably to the number of occasions onwhich Police are employed &quot; on gratuity.&quot;    That the practice should have continued for so long and assumed such largeproportions is perhaps somewhat surprising, and I can only assume that the extentof its development has not been realised, although I find a record that ten yearsago the amount being received amounted to no less than  26,000 a year.    In  this connection I  wish to mention another highly questionable practice which has  come to my notice.  I find that it is  not uncommon for individualofficers often of high standing to be offered and to accept sums of money from such bodies as Football Clubs in recognition of the manner in which police dutieshave been carried out under their supervision.  Thus,  a Superintendent, whoseemoluments rise to nearly  800 a year at the maximum, will receive a cheque for,say,  15, as a sort of &quot; tip &quot; at the end of the football season from a club whichhas a ground on his Division.    Also, sums of money  are sometimes sent for distribution amongst the officersengaged on certain work or at certain places.    Although the objections to all these practices and  the abuses to which theyare liable are obvious enough,  I have hesitated to take drastic action in regard tothem on my own authority.  I am fully satisfied that action is necessary, but, asthe practices are of such long standing and the money received has become almosta part of the ordinary emoluments, I have thought  it better to content myself withdealing with a few individual instances and preventing the system from spreadingfurther, and to reserve the matter for consideration by the Cabinet in conjunctionwith the other reforms I am proposing.    My suggestions are :     (1) That employment on &apos;&apos; gratuity &apos;&apos; should cease altogether.    (2) That payments to  individual officers or  to groups of officers should be           returned to the  donors, or, if acceptance is justifiable and free from           all possibility  of abuse, should be paid into the Commissioners Fund           for distribution to Police  charities and athletic clubs, as  is done, I           believe, in the majority of Police  Forces throughout the country.
                                CHAPTER IV.                     The Federation and Branch Boards.     By  the Police Act of 1919  the  Police Federation was set  up.   All  police officers below the rank of Superintendent belong to it  automatically, and  its declared object is to enable them  to bring to the notice of the authorities and the Secretary of State  &quot; all matters affecting their welfare and efficiency other than questions of discipline and promotion affecting individuals.&quot;     The legal object of the Federation is, therefore, to make representations to the authorities, but what  I find in fact is that it is being used as a rallying-point for  the  discontented elements in the police and as  a legalised  instrument for stirring  up unrest and stimulating resistance to Government decisions.     The Federation is a  national organisation,  and  the  Act also provides that there shall be in each  separate Force three Branch Boards :  one for  Constables, one for Sergeants and one for Inspectors.     This measure followed immediately upon the strikes of 1918 and  1919 and was the outcome of a long-drawn-out agitation by the men for representation on trades union lines.     The Federation addresses its representations to the Secretary of State, whilst the Branch Boards ordinarily communicate with their own Chief Officer or Police Authority.     The schedule of the Act prescribes the manner in which the Branch Boards shall be  formed.  It empowers them  to appoint  Committees or Sub-Committees and to sit together or separately,  and lays down that  there may be four meetings per annum of each Branch Board lasting  one day each, and  that leave shall be given for attendance at all such meetings.     Thus in  the Metropolitan Force the  requirements  of the law would  be satisfied  by  a total  of   twelve meetings  a year  of one  day  each,  or  about 2.700 man-hours  (the strength of each of the Boards being twenty-eight).     The actual position  is, however, entirely different,  and instead of  twelve meetings there are about 480.     It appears  that when the Act of 1919 was passed  it was regarded in the Metropolitan Force as merely providing a skeleton  of the actual requirements, and  there was superimposed on to it  an elaborate system of periodical meetings both at Headquarters and in Divisions.     Each Branch Board has an Executive Committee of  six to twelve  members. and the three Committees meet also as a Joint Executive Committee with a total of twenty-six members. Then there are meetings in Divisions of  what are called the Divisional Committees.  These take place, as a rule, once a month in each Division  and last for a whole working day.   There are  twenty-three Divisions, and in one particular Division there are as many as seventeen Stations, so that in this case seventeen men may meet for a whole day once a month  to consider the affairs of one rank in one Division.    These arrangements are authorised in a document known as the Constitution, which was drafted by the men&apos;s representatives in 1919 and accepted more or less as it stood by the Commissioner.  They are confirmed  each year by the republica- tion  of the Constitution in Police Orders,  and no important modifications have been made since the document was originally drawn up.    I have carefully considered the matter, and  I have examined the output  of this elaborate organisation perhaps more minutely than has been done  for some time.    The  first conclusion I reach is that the amount of time involved  is entirely unjustifiable and  that the  legitimate objects of the Branch Boards could be well achieved as  is,  I believe,  actually   done  in  every  other Police Force in the country with a very much less formidable programme of  meetings.    Apart  from  the waste of  public money involved, it  seems to me  that the compulsory assemblage of  men, regardless of whether there  is any real business to  transact,  constitutes an incentive  to idleness and a  strong  inducement  to manufacture grievances in  order to give an appearance of justification to an over-elaborate and wasteful system.    That the Branch  Boards and also the Federation  itself have  departedentirely from the  purposes  for which they were originally  set up there can be no
-doubt.  This has been particularly noticeable recently in connection with the pavcuts.  It came to my knowledge a few months ago that notices had been exhibitedin thirty Stations in the Metropolitan area containing what purported to be astatement of the case against the cuts.  It was a highly insubordinate document and entirely misrepresented the facts.  It said, for instance, that the Governmentwas making &quot;a deliberate attempt  to reduce the standard of  living&quot; of  thePolice,  and that  &quot; no  serious attempt had  been  made  to effect economies,  in administration,&quot; and it criticised appointments made by myself with the HomeSecretary&apos;s approval.     In  one instance a local meeting of Constables  even constituted itself  into adisciplinary  body and  passed  a vote of censure  on one of their members  forcarrying out an order issued by  myself with which the Branch  Boards did  nothappen to agree.     Facilities are  given  for the printing  and circulation of their resolutionsthroughout the Force, and the Federation issues annual reports (available to thepublic and  distributed  in  thousands to all  Forces), which  consist largely  of propaganda and distorted statements on a variety of subjects.     The use of  insolent and insubordinate language in resolutions subsequentlycirculated in large numbers is not uncommon.  In  one instance they described adecision reached by my predecessor as a &quot; travesty  of justice.&quot;  In another theyin effect accused both the Secretary of State and myself of dishonesty.     One result of all this is that on  a large number of topics some important.some  trivial the men are having one side of the picture continually put  before i hem.     Another is that they are being shown by repeated example how far authoritycan be flouted with impunity.  Discipline becomes a mockery, and unrest is keptcontinually  alive.   Steps have been  taken  to check  insubordinate language  inresolutions,  but there  is  no effective counter-blast to  the  steady stream  of propaganda.  The  representative organisations which  were set  up because  thenormal  channels for ventilating grievances through superior  officers had beenfound inadequate,  are  being used as a means of undermining  authority andinterfering with administration.    I have  referred already to the large  number  of Jjpurs spent on meetings.The resolutions which  emerge  are  not, in  fact, very numerous considering  theamount of time and talk that is spent in their preparation,  but they cause aconsiderable amount of unnecessary work  in my office  during  the course  of  theyear.  The matters dealt with  are seldom of any real importance, and it is therarest thing to receive any constructive suggestion for increasing efficiency.  Theyfrequently deal with  the  pettifogging grievances  of individuals which,  on examination, often  prove to be misrepresented or groundless. When an unwieldyBoard of Management of the Orphanage was reduced to  reasonable proportionsto prevent the gross waste of public money  involved, the Branch  Boards draftedpages of resolutions and wasted hours of the time of my predecessor and myself.and when  this  was not successful  they withdrew their men from the  Boardaltogether.  They seldom accept a decision as final, and frequently appeal  to theHome Secretary over my Head.  In one instance they made two  representations to me and three to the Home Secretary on a question whether certain Constablesshould be allowed extra leave  because they had to fix fresh numerals  to theiruniforms on changing their Divisions.    I  cannot find  that anything quite corresponding to  the Federation andBranch Boards  exists in other branches of Government  service  or in  industry.The Civil Service has its Whitley  machinery, and in industry there are  trade boards,  Industrial Councils,   and  various  other  expedients   for  adjustingdifferences between employers and employed. But these are in the main designedto provide means by which representatives of the two sides may meet one another and discuss,  whereas the object of the Branch Boards scheme is to enable  themen to  make representations to the  Commissioner  on any matters of welfare or-efficiency on which they feel strongly.  Unlike the Civil  Service, the Police area  disciplined  Force and necessarily  so and it was never the intention, if 1understand  the Act rightly, to  enable  their representatives to  interfere with matters which are primarily the responsibility of the administrative authorities.(I am not referring here to the &quot; Polipe Council,&quot; which corresponds more  nearlyto the National Whitley Council in  the Civil Service.)     The nearest approach in Government  Service  is found in  the existence and
 recognition of certain Associations of various grades of employees and the staff side of the Whitley Councils.  The Associations have  no legal status, but they obtain recognition  when they can  satisfy the  authorities that they do in fact represent those  whom they purport to represent, and  their nominees form the staff sides of the Departmental and National Whitley Councils.     As regards  meetings, those of the Whitley Councils themselves, i.e., when the official side and  the staff side confer, are held in Government time, but it was laid down in a Treasury Circular of 1921 that  &quot; meetings of staff sides or associations. or other absences in connection with staff  side or association business, should not in general entail any interference with an officer&apos;s normal attendance on. duty.&quot; (Provision is included for  certain limited exceptions to be made with Treasury sanction.)  These arrangements still hold good.     Somewhat similar arrangements,  it  is  believed, apply in industry.   When employers  meet  employed in conference, the representatives of the men are often trades union officials, and,  when they are not. the time spent would no doubt be usually regarded as a charge on the undertaking or industry.  But no employee would expect to  receive pay from his employer for the time he spends in attending trades union meetings.     It is thus clear that the privileges enjoyed by the Police in this  respect would be more or less unique even if they had been strictly confined to those prescribed by the Act of 1919.  Expanded as they have been in the Metropolitan Force (and in no other Police Force so far as I can ascertain) by subsequent extra-legal provisions, they could only be justified if  they could be  shown to produce results of really important practical value.     I think I have already said enough to show that they do not in fact  produce such results, and that their  utility  as a  safety valve  for grievances is  entirely outweighed by  the damage  they do in fomenting discontent and stirring up opposition to constituted authority.     I am not suggesting the abolition of  the Federation or Branch Boards.  As already stated in Chapter I, I hope that when the quality of the officers has been improved, the necessity for these organisations will disappear.  But the amount of time and energy which is  at present deflected in the  Metropolitan Force from legitimate  police work  by their activities is so large that it  seems to me  to be essential (on grounds of economy alone  if there  were  no other arguments) to curtail it drastically  and bring it  into closer correspondence with what  was the apparent intention of the Act.     I therefore propose the following arrangements :  1.  Central Meetings.     (a) Branch  Board meetings should stand (four per annum for each Board).     (b) Executive Committee meetings now permissible at the rate of  two per month should be ordinarily once a quarter, with the option of extending the meeting over more than one  day if the business cannot be completed, and with the proviso that special meetings  for  special  business can be allowed in the intervening period.     (c)  Joint Executive Committee. This Committee is not provided for in the Act, but it is useful to the extent that, if it did  not  exist, the three Boards would no doubt claim their statutory privilege of meeting together as a full joint Board more frequently than they do now.  It  will be sufficient if  this  Committee is allowed to meet every  six months for one day.     There  will then be every year         Four meetings of the Inspectors&apos; Branch Board.        Four meetings of the Sergeants&apos; Branch Board.        Four meetings of the Constables&apos; Branch Board.        Four meetings of the Inspectors&apos; Executive Committee.        Four meetings of the Sergeants&apos; Executive Committee.        Four meetings of the Constables&apos; Executive Committee.        Two meetings of the Joint Executive Committee.2.  Divisional Meetings.    Divisional  meetings of Station representatives should be  restricted to oneevery six months for each rank in each Division, with provision for extra meetingsfor special  purposes with the Commissioners authority in each case.
    I suggest, further, that steps should be taken to put a definite end to thedistribution of propaganda, so far as the Metropolitan Force is concerned, bothby the Federation and the Branch Boards.   It will be amply sufficient if any decisions reached in result of resolutions put before me or the Secretary of state by these bodies and which concern the Force as a whole are communicated to theForce in my Police Orders.  Beyond this, any printing or circulation of minutes,resolutions, reports or replies should be absolutely prohibited.                                               TRENCHARD,                                   Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis.    N&quot;ew Scotland Yard,             March 8.  1933.                  APPENDIX ITO MEMORANDUM BY  THE COMMISSIONER OF POLICE.SCHEME  FOR IMPROVING THE QUALITY  OF THE OFFICERS IN THE  METROPOLITAN                               POLICE FORCE.                              I. RECRUITMENT.     1.  There will be two sources of supply -            (a) from outside the Force.           (6) from the Force itself.     2.  Those taken from outside the Force will be men educated in universities,public schools and secondary schools.   Members of the Civil  Staff at scotland yard will also be eligible.     3.  They will be  required to take, a competitive  educational examination,unless they can show  that they have already reached  a standard of educationwhich would make this unnecessary.     4.  The examination will follow the ordinary public or secondary  schoolcurriculum, and will include  an interview before a Board, who will examine theirpast records and assess their qualifications in respect of character and personality.About 20 per cent, of the marks for the whole examination will be allotted to the interview.     5.  Those exempted from  the educational examination will appear before a selection Committee similar  to the Interview Board referred to above, and theirinitial acceptance or rejection will depend on the findings of this Board (subjectto  confirmation by the Commissioner).     6.  A list will  be compiled of  the  educational certificates or examinationswhich will be regarded as sufficient to exempt candidates from further examina-tion.  It will include degrees obtained at the principal universities, the  CivilService Administrative  Class Examination,  and  others  of  similar  or  higher standard.     7.  Candidates from the Force itself will be eligible to compete on level terms with those from  outside and, in  addition, a selection will  be made by a Boardfrom amongst Constables who are not educationally qualified to pass the ordinaryexamination, but appear to possess the  qualities  of character and personality tomake good officers (provided  their  education is sufficient to enable them to benefit from further instruction).     8.  Exceptionally, also,  men of  longer service will  be taken from any of the subordinate ranks if &quot;they develop  the requisite qualities at a later stage.   Thesemen will after  such  training as may be considered necessary be eligible for appointment direct to one of the higher ranks, such as  Sub-Divisional Inspectoror even Chief Inspector.
     9.  The normal age limits for those taken from outside will be 19 to 25 andfor constables 20 to 26, but at the start the upper age limit may be extended to 30in order to secure a number of older men in the initial stages and also to obviatea large number of simultaneous  retirements subsequently.                                II. Training.     10.  For their initial training successful candidates will  pass to a PoliceCollege, which will  have to be set up for the purpose.  It should have residentialquarters, lecture rooms, grounds, &amp;c, sufficient not only for the cadets,  but also(eventually, if not at the outset)  for the initial training of Constables now carriedout at Peel House.     Candidates will start by receiving for three or four months the same sort oftraining (perhaps with some additions) as  is given  to ordinary Constables. Atthe end of this  preliminary training they will go out to divisions and  work asConstables, remaining under instruction there and acquiring practical knowledgeof police duties for  a period of from six to twelve months. They will then returnto College to be tested in police duties and, if they pass this test satisfactorily,they will remain at the College for a further period of a year to undergo highertraining in police duties and general knowledge applicable to police problems.     11.  At the end of this second period at College will  be the final examination,which will consist mainly of a test of  their capacity for the work  that  they are going to be  called upon  to do.  They will also appear before a Selection Boardconsisting of two of the senior instructors at the College, with a senior policeofficer as chairman, which will judge whether their personality and charactertomes.up to the required standard.  The Selection Board will look at their records and  receive reports from the College to assist them in forming their conclusions.     The final selection of these officers will be subject to the Commissioner^approval.     The examinations during the period of training will therefore be         (1)  Entrance  examination  (if not exempted by educational qualifiea-               tions).        (2) After first period at College (end of three months).        (3) After period as Constable in Division.        (4) Final test after second period  at  College.                         III. The Officers&apos; Career.     12.  After training the cadet  will be appointed as a Junior Inspector (seeparagraph 18) and will  remain on probation for one year.   At the end of thattime a report will be submitted by  three senior officers as to his fitness for finalappointment.  No officer will be allowed  to marry until after the probationaryperiod.     13.  There will be only one list of officers both for C.I.D. and Uniform work.The  original assignment of an officer as a Junior Inspector (after  probation) to ordinary duties  or criminal work will  depend on his attainments at the college and his special capacities, but he will be liable to transfer from one kind of  workto the other  (or to  a combination of both) on promotion or at any other  time.Thus a Junior Inspector who does crime work may, on becoming an Inspector, doUniform work and on promotion to Sub-Divisional  Inspector and  higher rankslook  after both or specialise in one. Similarly an officer may be assigned either at the start or later to one of the branches at Headquarters such as the FingerPrints branch or the Criminal Record Office.     The aim will be to give every officer  who has the  necessary capacity the widest possible experience and  at  the same time gradually  to break down thebarrier  which at present exists between the Uniform branch  and the C.I.D. andso secure better co-operation and mutual understanding.     14.  Suitable officers will be eligible for appointment to the Civil  Staff atScotland Yard either at the outset or more probably after some experience inordinary police work.   (It should be explained that there is  at HQ. a staff ofsome 310 men and 50 women who are responsible under the Secretary for the bulkof the administrative and clerical duties.  Of this number, thirty-five (all  men)may be regarded as &quot; Higher Staff &quot; recruited in the main from the Universities
and corresponding more or less with the higher stall in an ordinary GovernmentOffice.)    15.  Experience  in  Civil posts  would  be  useful to  police officers,  and experience in police work would often assist the Civil s&apos;taff in the performance oftheir duties.  It is not contemplated that individual officers would be constantlytransferred from Civil to Police posts and back again, but such transfers wouldbe regarded as  possible at any time.  The main determining  factor would be thespecial capacities and temperament of individuals.  An officer who. either at thebeginning of his career or after a period of service, shows himself to  be bettersuited to office work than to ordinary police duties might be appointed to a  Civilpost.  Again, an officer who has shown in his police work peculiar  capacity for administration  or some special branch of it might be similarly transferred to do that work.  Equally,  the right type  of civilian officer might at any time beappointed to a Police post, but this would usually occur in the case  of fairlysenior officers who had achieved positions of a kind to demonstrate their powersof leadership and suitability for such employment.    When an officer is serving on  the Civil side he would  receive the Civil  ratesof pay.    The differences in salaries, pension rights and conditions of service betweenPolice  and  Civil staff would  alone preclude frequent transfers of  the  sameindividual.  Such transfers are, however, provided for by Section 10 (1) of thePolice  Pensions Act,  1921. and the conditions laid down  in that Section wouldbe applied.    16.  The annual  intake of candidates will be about thirty-three, and on thebasis of an average age of 23 their prospects of reaching the various higher ranksshould be approximately as follows :                                                Average Age  Percentage of Entrant?.

Changes Necessary in the Force.     17.  Three important  changes will  be necessary.   The first concerns the inspector grade, the second relates to the  number of higher posts that will berequired, both  at Headquarters and in Divisions, and the third is a proposal to vary the ages of compulsory- retirement.     18.  As regards the Inspectors.  There are  at present 547 of this grade, and below it there are Station  Sergeants, Sergeants and Constables.  It is proposed to sub-divide  the Inspectors  into three, viz.,  Inspectors, Junior Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors.   As has been explained already in  paragraph 12, the first  appoint-ment of the cadet will be  to a Junior Inspectorship.  From this he will  move up after about three years and become an Inspector.  The new Sub-Inspector Gradewill be the  highest rank normally attainable by the man who joins as an ordinaryconstable and is not selected for  special  promotion to officer rank.   The Sub-Inspectors  will be, as it were, the senior Warrant Officers of the Force.     19.  The reason for this proposal is  that after an examination of the work done by Inspectors,  I have  reached the conclusion  that whilst it  is necessary tointroduce the new type of officer at this point, there is a  good deal of work nowcarried  out by  the  Inspector  grade, which is  more appropriate to a man ofseniority and experience,  who has worked  his way up from  below,  than to theyoung man of the new type contemplated;  It is proposed, therefore, to have about270 Sub-Inspectors, and to divide the remaining number between Junior Inspector-ships and Inspectorships.     20.  As regards higher posts, the following table shows the number in eachrank as at present,  and the approximate number that  I  propose.   It is clearlyimpossible  at this stage to be absolutely precise on this point, and I anticipate that

Inspectors.         t Including 2nd Class U.I.D. Inspectors.    21.   It will be seen that important additions are suggested in the numbers ofvarious  ranks, and, before entering  upon a detailed explanation of the case asregards  each rank, I wish to say that in drawing up the proposed  cadre I havehad two main considerations in mind.  First of all there is the necessity of offering a career sufficiently attractive to induce men of the right quality to go in for it,and, secondly, the number of posts in each  grade must be closely related to theactual requirements of the work to be carried out.  Although it is not possible without much more drastic adjustments than I  am proposing, to compete asregards  financial attraction with the higher ranks of the Civil Service,  I amhopeful  that a sufficient supply of young men of good education may be drawn to police work (in spite of the small number of well-paid posts) by the interest and variety of the work, and the fact that it is  not a wholly indoor occupation.  Aswill be explained in discussing  the separate ranks, the proposed additions havebeen made only at points at which the present organisation  exhibits  weakness.    22.   At  Headquarters  the  need for a strengthening  of  the  staff  is mostnoticeable,  and I am proposing that one Assistant Commissioner and two DeputyAssistant Commissioners, as well as a certain number of officers of lower rank,shall be  added.   Hardly a week, or even a day, passes without my having occasion to deplore  the  lack  of  real supervision  in  almost every  phase of police  work.Instances constantly arise not only in connection with the day-to-day tasks (suchas the prevention of crime and the catching of criminals, the welfare and content-ment of the men and the maintenance of proper touch between  them and theirsuperior officers), but also in the realm of creative work, the examination of new methods, the elimination of wasted effort  and the modernisation of technicalequipment.    23.   The new Organisation Department (which was formed at the beginningof 1932  without any addition to  the higher ranks in the office) is achieving a greatdeal, but the tasks already allotted to it are sufficient to keep it occupied for  anumber  of years and  fresh lines of enquiry  and  development are constantlyemerging.  But the Metropolitan Force is suffering, and has suffered for  years,from starvation at the top, and  until this state of affairs is remedied  there is no real prospect of making the best use of this huge machine,  or of giving the tax-payers and ratepayers real value for the 8 millions a year they spend on it.    24.   Looking at the problem from the point of view  of the Commissionerhimself, it is not difficult to see how necessary it is, if he is to do his job properly,that he  should be supported by a reasonably complete staff of senior officers, sothat he can have ready and competent assistance in every Department of his work,and not find gaps in the organisation which either have to be filled by his  doing the work himself  or have to be left empty.  It does not require much imaginationto realise that the responsibility for an area of 700 square miles, a population of   millions and a Force of 20,000 produces a steady flow of problems not onlyextremely various in kind, but also very formidable in sheer bulk.    25.   The scope  and variety of  the task which modern conditions and the accumulation of  legislation have  imposed on those responsible  for the Metro-politan Police may be judged by a glance at  the duties allotted to the five Depart-ments at Scotland Yard.minor modifications will have to be made in the numbers suggested, both in senior
    A  Department deals with the administration and discipline of the Force,promotions, transfers, rates of pay, ceremonial, movements, medical work, orders.records, liquor licences, &amp;c.    It is responsible also for arrangements connected with processions and public meetings, riots and disturbances and the preservation of order.    B  Department deals with the control of traffic, and the multifarious Acts and regulations relating to it, traffic offences, the licensing of public carriages, driversand conductors, and lost property.    C  Department deals  with crime and  its  detection, criminal records, fingerprints, the security of the State, the protection of Royalty and other  importantpersons, the movement of aliens.  &amp;c.  (Many of its duties  are of a national andsome of an international character.)    D  Department deals with organisation and  reorganisation, the  initiation.examination and application of new schemes,  the distribution of the Force,  itsrecruiting and training.    The Secretariat  includes the &quot;common services&quot; of the Office. i.e., statistics,registration, accounting, typing, &amp;c.   In addition,  it deals with a variety of matters not assignable  to other Departments,  such as parliamentary questions.branch boards, charities, street collections, licensing hours. &amp;c.    26.  The  staff as at present constituted is so fully engaged in keeping abreastof the current  work that they have little opportunity of thinking of anything else.An example of what I  have in mind arises in connection with crime detection.The  methods  of the criminal have  changed and  developed  and, although  suchinnovations as wireless, flying squads and  so on have given at least the outwardappearance of an attempt to keep up with him. recent events have shown prettyclearly that they have  been only partially successful.  The criminal  is gettingahead  more and more,  and  I  attribute this largely to the fact that  there  is noone at Headquarters who has the time or opportunity to study these problemswithout the constant distraction of dealing with individual cases and day-to-daybusiness.   I am  convinced that we shall never get ahead of the skilled thief whoyvorks  quickly and escapes by car from the scene of his crime until we institutesome kind of central operational direction of our own mobile Force.  In the Warair raids necessitated the institution of a point of central control at which theposition of the enemy at any moment was mechanically recorded, and from whichdirections could be rapidly  issued.  So also with the mobile criminal.  He has gone often before we know he has come.  Efforts to intercept him are not centrallydirected.   Information may be rapidly issued, but each police  ear acts more orless independently and  no one really knows what anybody else is doing.    27.  Then, again, as regards welfare it is a truism well recognised in the,Fighting Services and also nowadays in many  large industrial undertakings, thatif you want to get the best work out of a man you must  take the trouble to keephim  fit and look after  the conditions in which he lives.  There is probably nokind of organised employment in yvhich so much  depends on the  &quot; spirit &quot; andgood-will of the  individual man as  the police.  The policeman can work or he.can slack; he  can see things or he can turn his back.  And yet. in the Metro-politan Force, there is hardly any organised effort to  imbue the necessary spirit and to encourage the good-will.  Even  with officers of the right type there muststill be central  direction.  There are  115 Section Houses  which are the onlyhomes  of nearly  one-fifth of the Force where  they eat, sleep and take recreation.There  is no one  at Headquarters who can give the necessary  time  to see that conditions of  life are made as decent mind pleasant as they  can be.  It is not aquestion of money so much  as of regular  supervision.   And even  those who live in their own homes need  someone to help  them to get the  best that is to be hadand not to be  imposed upon by unscrupulous landlords.    28.  These  are  only  two instances of what I have called &quot;gaps&quot; in theorganisation.  Other examples could be given, but perhaps I have said enoughto establish the necessity for a strengthening of the staff at Headquarters.   TheForce has increased from 12,000 in 1887 to over 20,000 in 1933, and yet the numberof posts above  Superintendent have only increased  from  10 to 15, althoughquite obviously  the  duties to be carried  out  are enormously more complicatedthan they were fifty years ago.
    29.  These remarks refer particularly to the staff at Headquarters, but theyhave an application also in a general way to the increases proposed in the higherposts both in Districts and Divisions.  I now propose to take each rank separatelyand explain how the suggested augmentations will be utilised.    30.  Assistant  Commissioners. One  additional  post  is required.  As hasbeen shown, there are at present four Departments controlled by Police Officersand one under the Secretary (ranking as an Assistant Commissioner).  I am fullysatisfied that each of  the four  Departments should  be  under  an assistant commissioner.  Until recently the  Deputy Commissioner was in charge of oneof them.  Now, however,  it has been found  necessary that he should be  a realDeputy to the  Commissioner and  not have a Department as well, and, as atemporary measure, one of the Departments is being presided over by a DeputyAssistant Commissioner.   In order, therefore, to have an Assistant commissioner at the  head of each Department,  four  Assistant Commissioners  are  required inaddition to the Deputy Commissioner.    31.  Deputy Assistant Commissioners. The addition proposed is four.  Upto the  end  of 1931 there were two Deputy Assistant Commissioners  in the criminal Investigation Department and one in the Administrative Department.It is desirable that there should be again three Deputy Assistant Commissionersat Scotland Yard as Deputies to each of the three Departments : &quot; A  &quot; Adminis-tration, &quot;C&quot; Criminal Investigation, and  &quot;D&quot; Organisation.    It  is also necessary to have one in *&apos; B &quot; Traffic Department, but it is proposedthat  this Deputy  should be an Assistant  Secretary, who ranks  with a DeputyAssistant Commissioner.  The other four Deputy Assistant Commissioners arerequired to be in charge of the four Districts. The Districts are large, thicklypopulated and important, and the number of Police under the control of each ofthese officers is approximately 5,000 men.   The police officer in  charge of these districts should therefore be of a higher rank than Chief Constable.    32.  Chief Constables. The increase proposed is one eight as against sevennow. One Chief Constable is required in  each of  the following  Departments atScotland Yard :  &quot; A &quot; Administration, &quot; C &quot; C.I.D., and &quot; D &quot;  Organisation,with an additional one  in Organisation to  look after the  training  both of theofficers  at the Officers&apos; Training College and  the men at Peel House.  The otherfour are required,  one  in  each  District,  to  assist the  Deputy assistant commissioner.    The work in the Districts is considerably more than can be properly done byone senior officer, and it is therefore most  important that they should have somehigh officer  to help them  and to enable them to  get  out and about their  largeDistricts, to be in much closer touch with the Superintendents and to control andguide the work in Divisions much more than is now possible.    33.  Superintendents. There are now thirty-two  (as  against  thirty-eightin the proposed scheme), viz. :     The additional six Superintendents are required for various purposes.   Onewill be required in the Criminal Investigation Department in charge of FingerPrints and Criminal Records.  Another will be required for the training of theofficers, a  third is likely to  be  required in connection with the development of wireless, and another in connection with Motor Patrol work.    It is  a little  difficult at this  stage to make out a  detailed  case  for these additional Superintendents.   I  am fully satisfied that strengthening is needed inthis grade, though I am not prepared to indicate more definitely  at the moment at which precise points the additional strength would be applied.In DivisionsDockyardsThames DivisionHis  Majesty the King22 1 1 1At Headquarters     Public  Carriage Office    Special Branch  ...    C.l. Central Office    Area Superintendents1
    34.  Chief Inspectors. The present number of Chief Inspectors is thirty-eight and my proposal is 70, which is an increase of thirty-two.    It is intended to employ these officers as follows : Headquarters     &quot; A &quot;  Department    ...      ...       3    &quot; B &quot;  Department    ...      ...       2    &quot; C &quot;  Department    ...      ...       8    &quot; D &quot;  Department    ...      ...       4              -                           -        17To  each officer i/c District        ...       1         *To  each Division  ...       ...               2        44To  each of the 2  Dockyards       ...       l&quot;lThames Division  ...       ...      ...       1 I        5G.P.O.  Inquiry Staff      ...      ...       IfHyde Park       ...       ...      ...       lj             Total        ......    &apos; ...        70    The increase on the existing number at Headquarters  is six:          1  Chief Inspector  in charge of the Transport Section.         1  Chief Inspector  in charge of the Mounted Branch.         1  Chief Inspector  in B. 2 for Traffic duties.         1  Chief Inspector  in D. Organisation.         2  Chief Inspectors at the College where the officers are to be trained.    The Chief Inspector for each District is to supply a very real need, namely,a second staff officer to each Deputy Assistant Commissioner.  The additionalChief Inspector in each Division would relieve the Superintendent of much of thework he now does, especially routine office work, free him to devote more time topractical work and enable him to establish far closer  touch with his officers andmen.  One  Chief Inspector would deal with the ordinary duties of the UniformBranch,  including routine and office work, correspondence, clothing, equipment and stores.  He would also be responsible for the training and welfare of young officers and recruits.  The other  Chief Inspector would deal principally with theproblem of crime  prevention and detection, especially the aspects of crimepeculiar to his Division. He would advise as to the  best use to be made of themen and material to combat and prevent crime in the Division.  He would furthercontrol  and supervise the training in  connection with attacking and  preventingcrime and the control of OLD. and plain clothes men  on this work.    35.  Sub-Divisional Inspectors (including  1st Class C.I.D.). This  rank  isnow 155.  The figure I have taken is 161.  Each of the eighty-seven Sub-Divisionsmust have one Sub-Divisional Inspector, and each of the twenty-two Divisions one for employment at Divisional Headquarters.  Moreover, one will be required forthe Thames Division and at each of the two Dockyards.  At least thirty-three ofthis rank, Uniform and C.I.D.,  will be required at Headquarters-    In a Sub-Division the Sub-Divisional  Inspector will be in  charge of all officers  and men attached to his Sub-Division,  including the C.I.D.,  and be generally responsible for the Sub-Division.   This would give him from 200 to250 men under him,  and he would be responsible for the discipline, efficiency,control  and welfare of his men.    The work of the Sub-Divisional  Inspector  attached to Divisional Head-quarters will be the training of officers and men, and assisting the Superintendentand Chief  Inspectors.    36.  Inspectors. The  present establishment, including C.I.D.,  2nd Class,is 547.  My proposed figure is about 280.    If  the figure is  taken  at 280 it is a reduction of 267  below the  presentestablishment,  and  this number will be  added  mainly  to  the  new  rank of sub-Inspector, which, as already explained, will be the senior &quot; Warrant Officer &quot;rank.    Of the 280 Inspectors proposed, forty will be employed at Headquarters and240 in Divisions.  Those at Headquarters will  be used for work for which  theyare now employed, there now being fifty-five.  The reduction of fifteen will be met by the  employment of an  increased number of  the  present Sub-Divisional or
1st Class C.I.D. Inspectors.  In Divisions, as a general rule, there will be threeInspectors  allotted to each of the eighty-seven ordinary Sub-Divisions, so as toprovide for one being always on duty throughout the twenty-four hours.  Thiswould need 260, but in some of the outer  and less important Sub-Divisions  Ipropose to  have the work performed by the highest rank below  that of the officerrank (Sub-Inspector), and in  this way I can  reduce the number  to 240 Inspectors.    The allotment of work to the three Inspectors in  each Sub-Division will beas follows :     One will have charge of the C.I.D. and men working in plain clothes.  Hewill specialise  in crime prevention  and  detection, and will take charge in allserious cases of crime.  The second will deal primarily with the Uniform Branchand police  activities generally.  The third  will assist generally, and will work closely with the second  Inspector, whose duty he  will perform alternately withhim.   He   will  have  to  be  conversant   with  all  matters   affecting  policeadministration.    It will be the duty of all the three Inspectors to  keep  in close personal touchwith their  men  and to look after their welfare. They will be  required to studycrime questions so as to fit themselves for this type  of work and for promotion.Special  arrangements for  training all officers in this particular aspect of policework will be made.    37.  The third and last important change proposed  is to  alter the ages atwhich officers can be called upon to retire with a pension as shown in the followingtable :         Deputy Commissioner ...        Assistant Commissioners        Deputy Assistant Commissioners        Chief Constables        Superintendents        Chief Inspectors        Sub-Divisional Inspectors        Inspectors        Junior Inspectors    Under the existing system there is a tendency for men to stay on long after they have ceased to be fully active and energetic, in order to secure the maximumpension.  Such men are often not definitely inefficient, but they lack the initiative and enthusiasm of the younger man.  The rank of Superintendent, for example,should not normally be held for  more than five years.  If a man fails to securefurther promotion within that time, it is better that he should take his  pension and make way for his juniors.    The reduction in the retiring ages is  also necessary to ensure a reasonablyrapid flow of promotion without which a  police career can hardly  be expectedto attract  able and ambitious young men.                              APPENDIX II               TO MEMORANUUM BY COMMISSIONER OF POLICE.                          SHORT SERVICE  SCHEME.  1.  The term of Service for the men taken in under this scheme will be ten years.  2.  The number to be recruited will be sufficient to ensure that at any momentabout one-quarter of the Force, viz., 5,000 men, are on the Short-Service basis.  3.  The method of recruitment will be the same for the Short-Service men as for those taken on the ordinary terms.  Of the candidates  presenting themselves for employment, those with the best qualifications particularly as regards education will be offered long-service engagements.  The number taken on these terms willbe limited by the amount of wastage to be made good  for the time being.   The  Present      ProposedRetiring: Age. Ketiring Ass.65656065575045454545
remainder will only be allowed to join on Short-Service terms. The tendency willbe.for the Short-Service men to supply the &quot;brawn &quot;  and the Long-Service mento supply the &quot; brains &quot; of the Force.  4. Pay and Gratuities. The men recruited under this system will receive thesame scales of pay as the others.  On retirement, after ten years&apos;  service, they willbe awarded a gratuity calculated on  the basis of one month&apos;s pay for  everycompleted year of service.   They will contribute to this gratuity by means of arateable deduction similar to that now in operation for all police, viz., 5 per cent.of pay. In the event of voluntary retirement or retirement on a medical certificatebefore the completion of ten years&apos; service,  they will receive a  refund  of  theirrateable deductions.  5. Injury on duty. A  Short-Service  Constable declared unfit for furtherservice in result of an injury on duty not the result of his own default, will receive a pension in accordance with the scale laid down in the Police Pensions Act,  1921,according to the degree of disability.  6. Transfer  to Long-Service  terms. The Short-Service system is not  to beregarded  as a stepping-stone to long service.  In very exceptional cases  where aman, who has accepted Short-Service terms, is found to have  special technical qualifications which are of value, it may be advisable to allow him to transfer toa Long-Service engagement.   Such cases will be few, and the possibility of transfer will not be held out as an inducement to men on joining.  7. Employment. Short-Service  Constables will carry  out all  the  ordinaryduties of  Uniform police officers, but they will not be eligible for promotion andwill not be accepted as candidates for the Criminal Investigation Department.Similarly they wall not usually be employed on special duties,  such as clericalwork, motor driving, &amp;c.  8. As has been explained, one of the main objects of the scheme is to give an improved career to the men who  join the Force as Constables on the ordinaryLong-Service basis.     If the scheme for introducing officers of a new type put forward in Chapter 1is applied, these Constables will only be eligible for promotion to the officer ranksby special selection.   This will, in fact, only affect a small number, and for theremainder the new Sub-Inspector grade wall constitute the limit of advancement.It is, therefore, desirable that the chance of reaching this grade or at least of becoming Station Sergeants should be better than it is under  present arrange-ments.  For this reason it is proposed that about 270 posts shall be made availableeither  in the Sub-Inspector grade or by additions to the Station Sergeant grade,the  Inspector grade being proportionately reduced.  This readjustment, coupled with the fact that the 5,000 Short-Service Constables will not be eligible, will, itis estimated, add considerably to the number of Long-Service Constables who will obtain promotion.     Promotion will also be secured at an earlier age.  On the  basis of an averageage of entry at 23, and retirement at 52, promotion to Sergeant should be obtained at 29, to Station Sergeant at 34 and to Sub-Inspector at 39.  9. The general effect and the principal object of the scheme is,  as stated in chapter II, to produce a younger and more active Force.o
