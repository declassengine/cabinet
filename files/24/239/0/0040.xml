THIS. DOCUMENT IS &quot;THE .PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA. JEHTY1S flOVSRNKENT.          Third JReport of  the UnempJ oyiaent Insurance Committee.                   Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.1.   I regret that I mu^t  record my dissent from the scheme put upby the Committee on Unemployment Insurance.20   In spite of some important modifications in the scheme as originally proposed, I am  still of opinion that the scheme is wronglyconceived and that its adoption would be a political blunder.Whatever may be said to the contrary it is the ap -lication of PoorLaw principles to large classes of the unemployed who have hitherto been free from them.   Many of our supporters will strongly objectto the inclusion of the industrial unemployed in the same class asthe casuals and vagrants,  and placing them under what will inevitably be regarded as  a Peer Law Commission operating an Actwhich.will be a reproduction of the main provisions of the Poor Law.When the needs test was introduced in September, 1931, we gavepledges that there should  be protection to those who for the first time were being made subject to it, and we provided that -     (i)  payment should be in cash ana. not in kind;    (ii) there should be no test work;                                                                     I   (iii) payment should not be on loan;    (iv) payment should not be made at a workhouse.It is now proposed to withdraw this protection.3.   I feel sure that the  majority of the House of Commons areexpecting us to deal with  the problem as an industrial ratherthan a poor law one.

VP;oto the Minister of Health, would not, in my view,  be asatisfactory or acceptable instrument of government, and I am sure that its relations with the Employment Exchanges, whopresumably must register, certify unemployment,  and pay&apos; thepersons relieved,  would create eerious practical difficulties.Also, it is, I think, clear that the Local Authorities willnot readily acquiesce in contributing to a scheme over whichthey have no control.   Finally, no consideration hes been givento the case of Scotland, though the Secretary of State has expressed grave doubts if the scheme could be applied in thatcountry.   If the scheme is a good one for England and Wales,then why not for Scotland?   If, on the other hand, it is not good enough for Scotland, how can we defend its application toEngland and Wales.4.   It 7/ill be asked what alternative I would suggest.   I circulated two Memoranda to the Cabinet Committee outlining theprinciples on which alternative schemes could be framed, and annex as an Appendix a  summary of these memoranda in  the form ofan alternative scheme.   The details of an alternative schemecennot, however, be worked out pending a decision on  the important question whether the Local Authorities are to be entirely  -occludedfrom the administration  of assistance to the able-bodiedunemployed.   If the Local Authorities need not be wholly  ext.: aded,they could be retained,  either  as assessing authorities or inconnection with an  appeal machinery.   If, on the other hand,they are excluded,  I could prepare a scheme, to be  administeredthrough  the Employment  Exchanges.   The scheme could  covereither  the  transitional  payment class or the whole of the  able-bodied unemployed within the industrial field;  the latter wouldbe the more logical course.   In either case, there would have tobe central  regulations  to secure reasonable uniformity, andthe Minister  should have the protection of a strong statutory commission  on whose advice  the  regulations would be made.
1o rr f  O Jof the participation of the Local Authorities should he decidedand that they should he consulted before any further progress can be made either with the scheme of the Minister of health or with any alternative scheme,   Also, it is essential to decide whether the Authorities are to be asked to continue to paysubstantially what they are now paying for the services transferred;the Exchequer paying no more than it now pays, or whether theclamour of many Authorities for financial assistance is to be met by relieving them of some of their present costs of outdoor relief.6.     I feel bound also to call the attention of my colleagues to the time factor in the situation..   It is clearly impossiblenow to pass a Bill setting up an entirely new system beforethe existing provisions expire next June.   I doubt alsowhether we have sufficient time to prepare and pass anycomprehensive legislation on the subject before the Bummer Recess,and even if we can it could not cone into operation before theend of this year, if so soon.   It is inevitable, therefore,that there must be some extension of the transitional period.On the other hand, a mere extension of that period will notsuffice.   We cannot continue much longer with the present lackof uniformity and the disparities in the scales of relief, and I am convinced that we cannot get through another winter without atleast taking power to issue regulations to secure greateruniformity.   This measure would be confined to tho presenttransitional payment classes, i,e. those who hove teen insured but who have exhausted their insurance rights.   If this were doneI could at the same time introduce the Bill for the reform of theUnemployment Insurance Scheme,  which is practically ready.   Bythese means I should hope to be able to carry on through the coming jwinter.                                        &apos;  (irud.)  H.B.4th April, 1955.
                   APPENDIX,Essential Principles of an Alternative^Scheme.It is agreed that -   (a) there must he central regulations to secure uniformity   (b) the responsible Minister should have the protection of       a Statutory Commission;   (c) the Minister must have no power to intervene in       individual cases;   (d) the service must be taken out of local politics.The scheme I contemplate, which meets all the above points, i  (i) Ministerial responsibility.          A Minister to be responsible to Parliament for      the administration of the scheme.    He will be      responsible for making such rules as are not contained      in the Statute, and for issuing such instructions to      the machinery which will assess individual cases.      These rules would secure uniformity in admin:stration; (ii) Appointment of a Statutory Commission.         The Commission to be small and to be advisory and      not executive.    It will have in particular the duty      of advising the responsible Minister before he makes      rules:(iii) Local machinery for assessing payments.         Initial decisions within the ambit of the general      instructions to be in the hands of officials with an      opportunity of appeal from those decisions to some      appropriate local tribunal.   This would protect the      Minister from dealing with individual cases and take      the question of assessment out of local politics:
 (iv) Appeal Machinery.          This could take one of a number of forms -       (a)  the Public Assistance Committee of the             Local Authority;  or       (b)  a  joint Committee consisting of non-             elected persons appointed by the Minister             end persons nominated by the Local Authority;             or       (c)  a Committee  of the Local Employment Committee;             or       (d)  a local tribunal, similar to the Court of             Referees for insurance benefit, consisting              of an independent Chairman and two             assessors. (v)  Scope,          Scope and Finance are closely linked together.     The  amount of the  liability taken over from the     Local Authorities  will depend on the extent of the     financial contribution to be obtained from the     Authorities.   The scheme can be confined to the     present  transitional payment cless or be extended     to  the whole of  the able-bodied unemployed within     the  industrial field.(vi)  Training and Occupation.          No  new machine is required to develop training     and  occupation.    The Ministry of Labour have     for  many years been doing as much as circumstances     permit and with  the aid of  the experience which     the  Ministry have  gained  the machinery can be     steadily expanded  if aufficient money is available,
