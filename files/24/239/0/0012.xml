    4th PROOF  14MAR1933j--. -load Authorities,England and Wales.                                   MINISTRY OF HEALTH,                                         Whitehall, S.W.1.                                              February, 1933.   L am directed by the Minister of Health to request you to drawt!ie particular attention  of the  local authority to the Report ofthe Committee on Local Expenditure, Cmd. 4200.*   This Committee was set up by the Government and consisted of a Chairman and members of great experience in local administra-tion. nominated, at the request  of the Government, as individuals,not as representatives, by the London County Council and by  theprincipal associations of local authorities.  Local  authorities will,the Minister anticipates,&apos; regard the findings of a body thus consti-tuted as of exceptional interest and as requiring special and carefulconsideration on their part.   The Chapters of the Report which directly concern this ministry are (I) Introduction,  (III) Housing, (V) Public Health, (VI) PublicAssistance, (VII) General Organisation and Financial Administra-tion, (IX) Miscellaneous, and the related parts of  the Chapter  (X)Summary.   It  is  recommended in Chapter (I) (paragraph 13)  that  thereshould be an examination by a special  body of a system  of  blockgrants to  local authorities in respect  of all Exchequer aided local services.   The recommendation  is  under- consideration with the depart-aients of government primarily interested.  So far as this ministry is concerned, the effect of the Local Government Act, 1929, and ofthe housing legislation has been  to substitute for practically all  thepercentage grants a system of block and unit grants. The Ministryremain, however, interested from the point of view  of the principlesof local government.                 CHAPTER  III. HOUSING.   The  Bill  now  before Parliament embodies the views of  theGovernment on the main question of housing subsidies.   The Chapter refers to various other matters.   If, as he hopes, theHousing Bill becomes law, the Minister thinks that he can most appro-appropriately deal with those matters in the special circular which he  will then address to local authorities.  Eor the moment it will be suffi-c-ient to note that, alike in the Annual Reports of the Ministry andon all suitable occasions in conference and correspondence with local   * Published by His Majesty&apos;s Stationery Ollicc, price 2s. 6d. net.
authorities, stress has been laid on the principles set out in paragraph95 the avoidance of the waste involved in not  making full use ofsubsidised accommodation  for those who need it most.              CHAPTER V.-PUBLIC HEALTH.General.   The Committee consider that annual savings roughly approxi-mating to   1,000,000 should  be  attainable in the  Public  health services.   They also envisage a reduction of maintenance costs of sewage disposal of o  per cent, by changes in administration.   It will be seen from a perusal of this section of the Report that the economies are expected to be attained without diminution of service by the introduction of improvements in administration.  The Reportindicates  appreciation  by  the Committee  of the value  of thepublic health services and  of the essential need for  them in theinterest of the community.   They are impressed by the rapid growth of expenditure  on  some  of them  as,  for  instance, the  mental deficiency service  (paragraph 16S) which is, however, a service of very recent development.  The principles which have guided the mare fairly set out in paragraph 131 :        &quot; The proposals we make in this Chapter are not made solely    as temporary measures of retrenchment to be adopted to meet    a passing period of financial stringency :  our intention is also    to suggest ways in which the health services of the country can    be provided, in normal times, at substantially less cost.  It is    difficult  to evaluate in terms of money  services  necessary to    preserve, or designed to improve, the national health, and none    of our  suggestions  tend  to  reduce any service of real value    to public health.&quot;   The Minister does not question the general soundness of these principles and, as will be seen below, finds himself largely in agree-ment with most of the concrete suggestions  put forward by theCommittee with the object of securing improved methods of spendingthe available funds. The savings thereby to be secured are substan-tial  and necessary and should be far more than sufficient to enablelocal authorities to grapple with what is in these times a  questionof real difficulty, for the Minister as for the local  authorities, intheir common task of providing  for the public health. The publichealth service is not and cannot be a static service.  Circumstanceschange and fresh needs  develop  as medical  and health knowledge and practice grow.    In such  a  service  complete stagnation  would  be very falseeconomy and some measure of development and new expenditure is inevitable.
   An  outstanding instance is  the maternity  and child welfareservice. In recent years the problem of maternal mortality has beenluought prominently to the notice of local authorities, and the reportsof the  Departmental  Committee on  this subject have directedattention  to  the importance  of developing  and  completing the maternity services of local authorities if progress in the reductionof maternal mortality and morbidity is to be secured.   The circularletter 1107 and the accompanying memorandum 156/MCW, whichwere issued  by the Department in December,  1930,  contained anumber of suggestions for improving and extending these services,and the largo majority  of maternity and child welfare authoritieshave already adopted and put into operation one or  more of the suggestions.  But there are comparatively few areas in  which it canbe said that a complete service has yet been established, and thereis hero  a clear case for development  on urgent grounds of publichealth.   A further example is to be found in relation to the reconimenda-tion in  paragraph 217 of the Report that the  appropriation of poorlaw infirmaries as general hospitals should not be unduly pressed inpresent circumstances. On this the Minister would observe that thetransfer to local authorities of the poor law  medical  services hasinevitably reacted on the public health services of the authorities,who will naturally be aware of  the need for  improvement in the transferred services,  as  well as  of  the opportunities  for securingeconomies  in administration by  the co-ordination  and unification of the whole of their medical services.  The Minister is advised thatill fact the number of outstanding cases where the appropriation of poor law infirmaries is desirable on public health grounds, and isalso feasible  under present  conditions, may not be  large.   But,in such cases, he would  certainly think  it  a  matter for regretit&apos; appropriation is not made. In all such matters of development the local  authority is calledmi to weigh to the best of its ability the  need for economy againstthe urgency of the suggested public health development,  of what-ever kind it may be.  Where there is doubt  as to the right course,the Minister will be very ready in the future as in the past to assistthe local authority on  request by such advice as he can give, basedas it is on a wider knowledge of all the factors  than is  normally atthe disposal  of a single authority.  The  following  observations are offered on the detailed recom-niendations in the Chapter.  The Minister welcomes the support of the Committee in commend -ing some of these recommendations  to  the  acceptance of localauthorities. Such matters are, greater co-operation between authori-ties (paragraph  142),  the establishment  of a costing system for disposal works (paragraph 144), extension to smaller  areas of therefuse costing system introduced by  the Ministry (paragraph 147  5543.                                                       B
 it&apos;is proposed in the first instance, to introduce a populationlimit of 20,000 in place of the 30,000 now ruling), accurate costing of street cleaning  (paragraph 149), the avoidance  of costly schemesof lay-out of parks and pleasure grounds (paragraph  152), betterco-operation between authorities in regard to infectious  diseaseshospitals (paragraph  155), making the best use of the  institutionaltreatment available for tuberculosis cases by selection  (paragraphs,173 and 174), making the best use of the services of health visitorsparagraph 177).    There are certain further recommendations to which it appearsto the Minister that local authorities should give special considera-tiori.  Instances are  (paragraph  159)  shortening the routine periodof isolation for uncomplicated cases of scarlet fever, (paragraph 101)the treatment of mild cases of scarlet fever at home, (paragraph 102)the practice of terminal disinfection, (paragraph 1S5) the reservation of institutional treatment  to  those who  cannot be  adequatelytreated otherwise.    The Report raises the question of cost of capital  construction and of annual maintenance in respect of various classes of building baths and washhouses (paragraph  153),  mental hospitals (para-graph 103), mental deficiency institutions (paragraph 169), maternityhomes (paragraph 178), public assistance institutions (paragraph 210)and generally (paragraphs 183  and 184) in paragraphs  193-191certain special observations are made as to  comparative statements of cost and  as to the need for  further action  on  them by this ministry.    The question  of  the appropriate  capital  cost in the case of amental deficiency colony was exhaustively  examined recently by acommittee appointed by the Board of Control under the Chairman-ship of Mr. Walter Hedley,  K.C. (Stationery Office Paper 70-25.5.1931). The Minister understands that the Committee has in mind theapplication of a similar method to other classes of institutions andthat since maintenance costs are to some extent dependent on capitalexpenditure they also should be brought under survey.   The Ministerproposes to take appropriate action on the lines suggested by theCommittee, and at the same time to see how he can most effectivelymeet their view that further steps should be taken by  the ministry to secure adhesion to the standards  laid down after full enquiry.(paragraph  182) and more uniformity in costs (paragraph 194).    Reference may next be made to some specific recommendations on points of detail.   As regards that in paragraph 148 that the costof collecting trade refuse should be a charge on the traders concerned.the position  is that local authorites have power to charge at their discretion except in the case of hotels, restaurants, etc.  It is right that they should exercise the power unless such exercise would  be clearly unreasonable. As regards  the recommendation in  para-graph 153 as to the provision of only swimming and slipper baths.
other kinds of hath in fact constitute a very small part of the cost,and there is as yet no evidence that they need be a source of loss to the rates.  The Minister proposes to scrutinise each  case on its merits and commends that course to local authorities.  The recom-mendation  in paragraph 155 as to infectious  diseases  hospitals should  be borne in mind by local  authorities in connection withthe resurvey of that question and the scheme to  be made for each county under the Local Government Act, 1929.   In paragraph 170it is recommended that venereal disease clinics should in  addition totheir present activities have separate sessions at which charges aremade and that patients in scattered  areas able to pay fees should be advised  to  obtain treatment from  selected practitioners supplied with the necessary compounds b3&apos; the local authority.  The minister thinks that experimental action on  these lines might well be taken at  certain clinics  by the authorities  concerned  and the  resultsreported and considered. As regards the recommendation in regardto day nurseries in paragraph ISO, it appears to the Minister that ifnurseries  cannot  be filled with children  whose  mothers  go out  towork, vacancies should go to children requiring supervision owingto  unsatisfactory  home conditions.   The general recommendationia paragraph 191  (2) as to payment for services rendered involvesamendment of Section  132  of the Public Health Act, 1875.   In paragraphs 186-190 reference is made to the question, of thestandardisation and central purchasing of supplies.  The importanceof this matter in the interest at once of economy and efficiency hasbeen often stressed in the past.  It is recognised and effect given toit by many local  authorities  and the widest possible extension is obviously desirable.   The remainder of Chapter V, viz., paragraphs 163-171, deals with questions of mental disorder and mental deficiency, and the Ministerlias accordingly taken the views of the Board of Control with whomrests the primary  responsibility in these matters.  In paragraph 103 there is a recommendation of principle that thefunctions  of the Board should be restricted to advising on specialistquestions, their administrative duties being discharged by this ministry.   The whole question of the organisation of the Board  of Controland of its relations with this Ministry was exhaustively  consideredby the Royal Commission on  Lunacy and  Mental Disorder (Cmd.-\700, 1926).   In the result the Commission proposed certain reformsn the organisation of the Board and in the relations between it andhe Ministry.  The matter was dealt with accordingly in  the Mental reatnient Act,  1930,  and  in the  administrative  reorganisationes tilting from it, and before any further  change  is considered thelinister  thinks that it is but reasonable  to have  experience of thevorking  of  the  present arrangements.   It  should  of  course  beealised that, as Minister of Health, he is generally responsible to
Parliament for the operations of the Board of Control, and that liealso exercises certain specific powers  of great importance in regardto those operations as, e.g., the power of loan sanction.    As regards the detailed points made in the Report, the Ministeroffers the following observations :    Paragraph 1G3.  The suggestions as to standards of aocommoda-tion will be taken up in connection  with the general enquiry into these matters, above mentioned.  The Minister is assured by theBoard that they  would welcome any less costly methods of con-struction which can be devised, always provided that risk of fire isnot increased. They will examine carefully the possibility of eeoim-economising space in new buildings in existing buildings such economy is liable to lead to more casualties and increase of nursing stall&quot;.    Paragraph lG-t.  The transfer  of harmless  senile patients andmental defectives from mental  hospitals lias been  consistentlyurged by the  Board on local authorities.    Paragraph 1G5.  It is the present practice of the Board to giveattention to  the financial side of occupational  therapy, but  wherethe patient is recoverable, the question  of the first importance isthe therapeutic value of the work.    Paragraph  1G6.  The Board agree with the views expressed (ft) as to the vesting of full financial control in the Council and not in the Visiting Committee and (b) as to the Minister deciding differences between constituent authorities of Joint  Committees.  Here also the question  of amending legislation arises.    Paragraphs 1G7-171.  In  these  paragraphs attention is very properly drawn to the rapid increase in the cost of the mental deficiency service.  On this question it must be observed that neither the Board of Control nor the Minister could subscribe to the view expressed that there is no evidence that more than a  negligible number of the mentally deficient are  improved in condition hy treat- ment.  The effect of the experience obtained is, in fact, that all but a  negligible  number show improvement after treatment, both as regards habits, behaviour and capacity for work.  Further, in con- sidering merely the figures of expenditure in paragraph ICS without any allowance for other aspects of the question, it should be borne in mind that provision for mental defectives not treated in institutions appropriate to them has been, and is, a large element in the cost of public assistance.  These paragraphs cannot, accordingly,  be  ac- eopted without material qualification.  Nevertheless, the Board of Control and  the Minister are  equally desirous  of providing for this lately developed and  beneficent service only so much money as is requisite for its  needs.   It has been already noted that there has been a recent review of standards of mental deficiency (colony) accommodation  by  the Hedley Committee.   It  is  considered doubtful  whether any further general  reduction of the standards
laid down  by the Board is feasible, though a more extended useof temporary buildings for certain purposes  is under trial.   Theexperience  of  the  Board leads  them  to doubt  whether any lesselaborate  system of  classification would be economical or workuvll.   The figures given by the Wood Committee are in fact borne out by the actual ascertainments in a number of areas, and LocalAuthorities are accordingly advised  to plan the accommodationultimately needed on the basis of those figures, but actually onlyto build in stages to meet immediate  needs.   The  Board  agreethat full  use should be made of the system of guardianship andcommend it to local authorities,  subject always to the necessity of adequate  supervision  if  successful results  are  to  be obtained.Certain practical difficulties which have hitherto restricted the useof guardianship  cannot, however, be  removed without amending legislation.           CHAPTER VI. PUBLIC  ASSISTANCE.  This Chapter raises some very important questions of principle,the  power  to  supersede local  authorities  (paragraph 225),  thewithdrawal of public assistance to the able-bodied from the purview of local authorities (paragraph 22G), and the placing of public assist-ance and  transitional payments  in  the hands of independentpersons (paragraph  227).   These matters,  in respect of whichdissentient views are expressed in the report, are closely related to the problems raised by the recent report of the Royal Commissionon Unemployment Insurance,  and are  being considered by  the(government in that connection.  Further  paragraphs in the Chapter deal with amendments ofdie law.  Such an amendment would be requisite to give effect tothe recommendation in paragraph 228 (vii) as to National HealthInsurance and Friendly Society payments, but the Minister does notconsider such an amendment practicable.   The  recommendations in paragraphs  229  and 231 also require amendment of the law.In so far as they refer to insurance benefits and old age pensions, theywould  give  rise  to  certain difficulties which would  require most careful consideration.  Piecemeal amendment of the Poor Law Act,1930, seems to the Minister undesirable and he  proposes to deferconsideration of the paragraphs until he has in his hands the resultof the  comprehensive  examination of the statute undertaken bythe Joint  Committee of  the County Councils Association and association of Municipal Corporations referred to  in paragraph 230.  For the rest, the Chapter enunciates certain principles of soundpublic  assistance to  which the Minister is convinced that  it was never more  necessary than it is at present,  in the interests of thereeipients  themselves as well  as  of good administration, that thefullest  attention should bo paid by all authorities responsible for public assistance.
     CHAPTER VII. GENERAL  ORGANISATION  AND               FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION!   The Committee estimate the cost in 1930-1 of salaries and wages of  local  authorities  (including   teachers,  police, and   manual workers, but not persons  engaged in  the  trading  undertakings) at approximately   122,000,000.   They  consider  that, leaving outthe  pay  of  teachers  and  police,  and  assuming  that  all localauthorities make  deductions  with a degree of uniformity on thelines  suggested in circular letter 1222 of  the 11th  of  September.1931, it should be possible to reduce the wages bill of 1930-1 byabout  five millions.  Five members, however,  hold that such areduction must include administrative charges and cannot reason-ably be expected  to be produced from salaries and wages alone.   The salaries paid  to certain classes  of local officials as, c.(j.tteachers, police, or road officers, are the concern  of other Ministers.In regard to the generality of local officers, the salaries and conditionsof employment are, with  a few exceptions in the health and publicassistance services, the sole concern of the local authorities themselves and  the Minister has no definite responsibility.  The matter is.however, of such importance to the well-being and  progress of localgovernment that he cannot  but take a deep interest in it and hewould wish to offer certain observations for the careful considerationof local authorities.   The circular letter of the 11th of September, 1931, among other things directed the  attention of local authorities  to the proprietyof conforming to the action of the central government in the matterof temporary reductions  in the emoluments of officials and urged the desirability of local consultation with the officials on the subject.There has in practice been very great disparity in the way in whichthis  matter has been dealt  with by authorities.  In some casesno reductions appear to have been made at all and  in other casesthe reductions  have been  made on very different  lines.   This situa-tion seems to the Minister calculated to give rise to dissatisfactionand  even discontent among  the officials.  He thinks that in theaction  which local authorities take on this part  of the Report ofthe Committee on  Local Expenditure it is eminently desirablethat the fullest possible use shoidd be made of the method of con-sultation with  the officials commended in the circular of  the lltliof September, whether locally, or, as is even more desirable  to attainsome measure  of uniformity of action, centrally,  as, for example,by the  use of  the central associations of local authorities,  or some special  committee of those associations,  to confer with centralorganisations of the local officials.   In paragraph  237 the Report makes  some suggestions which appear  to the  Minister of great value.  Numbers of staff should certainly be re-examined  in the light of present  recpiirements and,
tiio Minister would  add, the possibility of reduction of numbersbv better organisation and improved methods of working should hecarefully  explored.  The salary  scales,  particularly of the higherofficers, are recommended by the Committee for review.  Essentialfactors in such a review are how salaries compare with those paid for similar duties in comparable places (there is very great lack ofuniformity in these matters),  what increase has been made since1914, how the question of the increased cost of living has been dealtwith, and what reduction has been made in recent  years.  In regardto some  classes of officers, it appears  to  the Minister eminentlydesirable  to consider  the propriety, either  on the occurrence  of a vacancy, or possibly by agreement,  of instituting  the practice of arixed salary to cover all work  to  be performed by the  officer.Generally, the Minister would desire to impress on local authorities that  what is needed is  not ill-considered and all-round reductionof salaries, which in some of the lower grades often do not compare favourably with what is paid in other public service or outside, buta cautious and  fair examination of the work to be done and the remuneration reasonable for that work  in  present conditions.  Ifthe matter is handled by authorities in this spirit, the Minister is confident that local officials, whether salaried or wage earners, willbe found ready, in the future as they have been in the past, to respond to the needs  of the time.  Paragraph 23S.  This point  is noted for  consideration when thenext occasion arises  for  suitable legislation.  Paragraph 239. The presentation of such an estimate to  Parlia-tneiit presents  somewhat serious  practical  difficulties  and  therecommendation needs,  and will receive,  further consideration.  Paragraph 240. It is the practice of the Ministry to lose no ipportunity  of  urging local authorities to frame their  plans of apical expenditure  on a three  or  five years&apos; basis and a widerrecourse  to this policy would be welcomed by the Minister.  Paragraph 241. The  principle of this recommendation is  fully iccepted by the Ministry. Objection is taken to meeting from loans-mall sums spent on capital works.  The Minister hopes that  local mt liorities will cany out the recommendation to  the fullest extent possible without unfairness to present ratepayers.  Paragraph 242.  The Minister welcomes  these  recommendations n regard to the periods for loan sanctions.  Paragraph 243. This recommendation  will be considered for Jiilusion in a Bill on the next appropriate occasion and with reference to the question which has been raised as to the proper construction if the existing statutory provision in regard to county councils.  Paragraph 244.   So far as  the Minister is concerned, he would rclcome the widest use of the  District Audit staff.  The extension
 by statute of the sphere of that staff to all municipal corporation accounts  as a  matter of obligation raises questions of some con- troversy and difficulty, and the Minister may note that a private Bill now before Parliament would  deal with the matter  by enabliiic municipal authorities to use the  district audit staff if they desire- to do so.  Such a desire has been frequently expressed in the past.    Paragraph 245.   The District Audit staff will be requested to keep possible debt conversions carefully under  review.              CHAPTER IX.-MISCELLANEOUS.    Paragraph 205.   Conferences.    This question is one which has given rise to great difficulty in the Ministry,  which is directly concerned in it by reason of the fact that in many cases the attendance of delegates of local authorities at the cost of the rates requires the sanction of the Ministry under the Local Authorities  (Expenses) Act, 1S87.  The difficulty of the matter u not lessened by the fact that not all authorities come  within tin ambit of  that Act for this purpose.    The Minister entirely endorses the view of the Committee that the number of conferences is far too large, the intervals between them sometimes too short, and much the same ground sometimes covered by more than one conference.    The difficultj&apos; of the  matter is  that, notably in the sphere of public health, the co-operation  of voluntary bodies and  societies is of very great value and periodical conferences  are a  recognised method of bringing it to  bear.    The Committee propose to meet the situation  by restricting the attendance of representatives, not more than two for each authority. at the expense of the rates to conferences convened by the respon-sible associations of local authorities.   Such a restriction appears tothe Minister to go too far, excluding, as it would, valuable and fruit-ful conferences like those, for example, of the  national association; concerned -with tuberculosis or mental welfare.    It appears to the Minister that the needs of the  situation can best be met (a) by a very careful scrutiny locally  and centrally of thenecessity for, and probable value of, any given conference, and (6) bythe restriction of the representation of a  local  authority  to one person at the charge of the rates, such person to be either a member u!the authority or an official, at their discretion, and any further repre-sentatives to  attend at their, own expense.  Where the  conference is convened by the responsible associations  of  local authorities the attendance of two persons at the charge of the rates  would seemreasonable.   Where the financial position  of  an  authority is bad.the Minister would  propose to  restrict attendance of a delegate atthe cost of the rates to a limited number of conferences in any year,not to exceed three.
  Paragraph 2C6.  The Minister endorses the view of the Com-committee as to the badness of any general practice of charging the ratesin respect of conferences held in the district.  Paragraph 270.  The Ministry  have lost no  opportunity  of pressing on local  authorities the imperative necessity of reducing expenditure on local enquiries by such steps as a fuller use of theirown officers, economy in the retention of counsel and avoidance of unnecessary expert witnesses.  The opportunity and the need for economy in this matter are equally striking and it deserves the mostserious consideiation of local authorities.  For his part the minister will not fail to give constant consideration to possible improvementsof procedure at enquiries to reduce cost.  Paragraph  271.   The Minister  heartily  concurs  as to  the excessive number  of private Bills presented in the past.   A furtherPublic General Bill will  be introduced as soon as parliamentary and other conditions admit of it.  Paragraphs 272-3.  These recommendations as to printing andadvertisements require, and are receiving, detailed attention  Paragraph  274.   The  recommendation  for  extension  of  thepractice  of making informal tests  of samples of food will be notedby local authorities, but it should also be noted that this methodincreases the risk that some forms of adulteration may go undetected.  Paragraph 275.  The questions  as to Registrars raised  in thisparagraph have been discussed  with the Registrar  General.  As regards the salary scales themselves, it is the fact that theywere settled as recently as 1929 in careful correspondence with thegeneral level of local government officers&apos; salaries then prevailing,which seemed to be the proper standard.  The Minister is not aware of any general change in that standard, though temporary reductions of salary were made in 1931-2.   Objection is not made to such temporary reductions in the case of registrars.  On the question of discretion as to salaries for local authoritiesthere are exceptional features about the work of registrars.  Thework is  identical and  the  central authority takes responsibilityfor it and cannot but aim at securing a reasonable uniform standardof competence.  The present provisions  were framed after longprotests from the staff, based largely on disparities which couldnot be defended, and the scale admits of some measure of flexibility.In the circumstances, the Minister does not think that any  change is requisite.  The Government desire to express  their sense of the importanceof the   contribution which local  authorities make towards  thenational well-being.  The Government are well aware of the diffi-tulties which confront those authorities in their task of providing
for a  sound  and expanding system  of local  services, and  at thesame time doing justice to the need for keeping down  the  rate burden in the interests alike of industry and of the general public.The Government are confident that  local government will,  in thefuture, as in the past, deal successfully with the problems set to  itand they trust  that the Report of  the  Ray  Committee  and the observations upon it now offered by the Minister will be of material assistance  in  the task.                               I am, Sir,                                    Your obedient Servant,Secretary.The Clerk to the Authority.
