(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE FRO PERT Y OF HIS BRITANNIC            MAJESTY&apos; S GO VERNMEN T ).COPY NO.  &amp; :*_SECRET.CP. 79(33).                  C A B I N S T.                      INDIA.          Appreciation of the Political Situation     by the Government of India,  dated 21st March, 1933.          Circulated for the information of the Cabinet     by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential appreciation of  the  Political  Situation  in   India dated 21st March,  1933,  issued  on  the         authority of the Secretary of State                      for India.      This issue of the appreciation synchronizes withthe publication of the White Paper containing theproposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government for constitutional reforms in India.  ITo attempt is made to anticipate the reactions to this important document.  As statedin the last appreciation,  some Congress supportersare anxious to abandon the civil disobedience movement and this feeling is undoubtedly gaining strength.Those who take this view regard civil disobedience as adefinite encumbrance on the policy which they favour of concentrating on securing power under the newconstitution.  Others, however, stigmatise this attitude as too defeatist end are greatly concerned at the idea that Congress should lose credit by confessing failure.Meantime, it has been decided to hold the annual Congresssession in Calcutta at the end of March.      Suggestions were freely made by the Liberals,that the object of the Congress session was. to considerthe White Paper, but prominence given to these assertionsin the Legislative Assembly forced a clear denial from congress, and it was explained that the date was fixed,not with reference to publication of the White Paper,but to avoid clashing with the date of the Calcuttamunicipal election.  Government found it impossible topermit a spectacular gathering of this kind to takeplace on behalf of a body which was still pursuingunconstitutional objects by unconstitutional methods , and
it was announced that, as Congress was still pledged to civil disobedience, the annual session could not he allowed.  The decision has &quot;been subjected to a gooddeal of formal criticism, on the ground that Congressought to have been allowed an opportunity of discussingtheir future policy regarding civil disobedience andreforms, but there is no doubt whatever in the minds of the supporters of the Government that any otherdecision would have &quot;been disastrous.      One of the main objects of the proposed sessionwas to revive interest and enthusiasm fox Congress andits policy; it is probable that the left wing, whichin Bengal is *losely allied to the terrorists, wouldhave dominated the session, and some circulars recentlyissued by the acting secretary show that attempts arebeing made to persuade delegates attending the session to have intensive demonstrations in the villages and towns through which they pass on their way to Calcutta.Provincial Congress Committees are also &quot;being asked to approve, for discussion at the session, resolution passed at the session held in Delhi last year, which included a reiteration of the Independence Resolution,and an endorsement of the action of the Working Committeein reviving civil disobedience.     Though  the session is due to take place in lessthan a fortnight, i&amp;ere are as yet no signs of markedCongress activity in support of it, and it appearsdoubtful whether delegates will attend in largenumbers.   If, owing to the attitude adopted &quot;by theGovernment, the proposed session proves a fiasco,  the credit of the Congress movement is likely to suffer.
At the same time , any agitation accompanying the attempt to hold  the session may involve an appreciablenumber of arrests and some temporary intensification of feeling.    The Temple Entry Bill has made no further progress,but may be discussed in the Assembly before the endof the session.  Meanwhile, orthodox opposition is becoming more organised, and addresses recentlypresented to the Viceroy have attacked Mr. Gandhi&apos;policy vigorously and frankly.
