The matter was considered at a further Meetingon Friday morning, when the Ministerial Committee decidedthat, as a matter of urgency, a notice ought to hecommunicated to the Press this evening, for announcement in the newspapers tomorrow morning, to the following effect:-         His Majesty&apos;s Government have had before         them a full account from Mr Eden, the         Parliamentary Under Secretary fo1&quot; Foreign         Affairs, who has represented the United         Kingdom at Geneva in recent weeks,  of the         present position at the Disarmament         Conference.  Deeply impressed with the         necessity o^ giving all possible assist-         ance to enable the Conference to reach         early and comprehensive decisions,  the         Cabinet have requested, the Prime Minister         and the Foreign Secretary, as the heads of         the United. Kingdom Delegation;, to go out         to Geneva as soon as can conveniently be         arranged, and they intend to do so.         Meanwhile, Mr Eden will return to Geneva         to resume leadership of the United Kingdom         Delegation pending their arrival.            (The exact terms of the above             announcement may have to be             varied during the day, and members             of the Cabinet will appreciate that             the authentic version will be the             one puh1ished.)                           -1-

Mr Henderson,  as  President ofthe Disarmament Conference,  will also  be informed.       Owing to pressure of  business,  the Prime minister was unable to arrange a full Meeting of  the Cabinet toconsider this question, but  he availed himself of theopportunity of a Meeting of  the Committee on Trade andEmployment to inform several of his colleagues who arenot also members    the Ministerial Committee  on disarmament.       In the above circumstances, and in view of theimportance attached by the Ministerial Committee  to immediate action, the Prime  Minister ha? felt  itnecessary to take responsibility for the announcement on the assumption that all his Cabinet colleagues maybe treated as agreeing.

Circular 1311.Local Authorities,England and Wales.MINISTRY OF HEALTH,      Whitehall, S.W.I.           February, 1933.SIR,    I am directed by the Minister of Health to request you to draw the particular attention of the local authority  to  the Report of the Committee on Local Expenditure, Cmd. 4200.*    This Committee was set up by the Government and consisted of a Chairman and members of great experience in local administra- tion, nominated, at&quot; the request of the Government, as individuals, not as representatives, by  the  London County Council and by the principal associations of local  authorities.  Local authorities will, the Minister anticipates, regard the findings of a body thus consti- tuted as of exceptional interest and as requiring special and careful consideration  on their part.    The Chapters of the Report which directly concern this Ministry are (I) Introduction, (III) Housing, (V) Public Health, (VI) Public Assistance, (VII) General Organisation and Financial Administra- tion, (IX) Miscellaneous, and the related parts of the  Chapter (X) Summary.    It  is recommended in Chapter (I)  (paragraph  13) that there should be an examination by a special body of a system of blockgrants to local authorities in  respect of all Exchequer aided local services.    The recommendation is under  consideration with  the depart-ments  of government primarily interested.  So far as this ministry is concerned, the effect of the Local Government Act, 1929, and ofthe housing legislation  has  been to  substitute for practically all thepercentage grants a system of block and unit grants.   The Ministryremain, however, interested from the point of view of the principlesof local government.   The Bill now before Parliament  embodies  the  views of theGovernment on the main question of housing subsidies.   The Chapter refers to various other matters.   If, as he hopes, theHousing Bill becomes law, the Minister thinks that he can most appro-appropriately deal with those matters in the special circular which he will then address to local authorities.   For the moment it will be suffi-cient to note that, alike in the Annual Reports of the Ministry andon all suitable occasions in conference and correspondence with localauthorities, stress has been laid on the principles set out in paragraph95 the avoidance  of the waste involved in allotting subsidisedhouses to those who do not need them the need of reducing the loss    *  Published by His Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office, price 2s.

on housing by requiring tenants who can afford higher rents eitherto pay them or to buy the houses or to vacate them the avoidance of the wasto involved  in  the  continued occupation of a  house inexcess of the needs of a family.              CHAPTER V.-PUBLIC HEALTH.General.   The Committee consider that annual savings roughly approximating to the following sums should be attainable in the PublicHealth Services :                                                             Refuse collection and disposal and street   cleansing     ......    ...     ...      500,000Scarlet fever treatment ...    ...     ...      120,000Terminal disinfection   ...    ...     ...      100,000Tuberculosis     ..........60-80,000Standardising  supmlies  ...    ...     ...      300,000   They also envisage a reduction of maintenance costs of sewage disposal bf 5 per cent, by changes in administration.   It will be seen from a perusal of this section of the Report that the economies are expected to be attained without diminution of service by the introduction of improvements in administration. The Reportindicates  appreciation  by  the  Committee  bf  the  value of thepublic health services and  of the essential heed for theiii in theinterest of the community.   They are impressed by the rapid growth of expenditure  oil  some  of them  as, for  instance, the mental deficiency service  (paragraph  108) which  is, however, a service of very recent development.  The principles which have guided the mare fairly set out in paragraph 131 :        &quot; The proposals we make in this Chapter are not made solely    as temporary measures of retrenchment to be adopted to meet    a passing period of financial stringency :  our intention is also    to suggest ways in which the health services of the country can    be provided, in  normal times, at substantially less  cost.   It is    difficult to evaluate in terms of money services necessary to    preserve, or designed to improve, the national health, and none    of our suggestions  tend  to  reduce any service of real value    to public health.&quot;   The Minister does not question the general soundness of these principles and, as will be seen below, finds himself largely in  agree-ment with most of  the  concrete suggestions put forward by theCommittee with the object of securing improved methods of spendingthe available funds.  The savings thereby to be secured are substan-tial and necessary and should be far inore than sufficient to enablelocal authorities to grapple with  what is in these times a  questionof real difficulty, for the Minister as for the ^cal authorities,  in
their common task of providing for the public health.  The publichealth service is not and cannot be a static service.  Circumstanceschange and fresh needs  develop as medical  and health knowledge and practice  grow.   In such  a service complete stagnation would be  very falseeconomy and some  measure of development and new expenditure is  inevitable.   An  outstanding  instance is the  maternity and child  welfareservice.  In recent years the problem of maternal mortality has beenbrought prominently to the notice of local authorities, and the reportsof the  Departmental  Committee  on this subject have  directedattention  to  the importance  of developing and completing  the maternity services of local authorities if progress in the reductionof maternal mortality and morbidity is to be secured.  The circularletter 1167 and the  accompanying memorandum 156/MCW, whichwere issued by  the Department in  December, 1930, contained  anumber of suggestions for improving and extending these services,and the large majority  of maternity and child welfare  authoritieshave already adopted and put into  operation  one or more of the suggestions.  But there are comparatively few areas in which it canbe said that a complete service has yet been established, and thereis  here a clear  case for development on urgent grounds of publichealth.   A further  example is to be found in relation to the recommenda-tion in paragraph 217 of the Report that the appropriation of poorlaw infirmaries as general hospitals should not be unduly pressed inpresent circumstances.  On this the Minister  would observe that thetransfer to local authorities of the poor law medical services hasinevitably reacted on the public health services of the authorities,who  will naturally  be aware of the  need for improvement in the transferred services, as well as of the opportunities for securingeconomies in administration by the co-ordination and unification of the whole of their medical services. The Minister is advised thatin fact the number of outstanding cases where the appropriation of poor law infirmaries is  desirable on  public health grounds, and isalso  feasible  under present conditions, may not be large.   But,in such cases,  he woidd certainly  think it a matter for regretif appropriation is not made.  In all such matters of development the local authority is  called on to weigh to  the best of its ability the need for economy againstthe urgency of  the  suggested public  health  development, of what-ever  kind it may be.  Where  there  is doubt as to the right course,the Minister will be very ready in the future as in the past to assistthe local authority on request  by such advice as he can give, basedas it is on a wider knowledge of all the factors than is normally atthe disposal  of  a single authority.   The  following observations are offered on the detailed recom-mendations in the Chapter.5543.
    The Minister welcomes the support of the Committee in commend - ing some  of these  recommendations to  the acceptance of local authorities.  Such matters are, greater co-operation between authoi i ties (paragraph  142),  the  establishment  of a costing system for disposal works (paragraph 144), extension  to smaller areas of the refuse costing system  introduced  by the Ministry (paragraph  147  it is proposed  in the  first instance, to introduce  a population limit of 20,000 in place of the 30,000 now riding), accurate costing of street cleaning paragraph 149), the avoidance  of costly schemes of lay-out  of parks and pleasure grounds  (paragraph  152), the re- viewing of scales of charges in baths and washhouses (paragraph 153;. better co-operation between authorities  in regard  to infectious diseases hospitals (paragraph 155), greater care  in the selection of tuberculous  cases for  institutional treatment, particularly inter- mediate cases and children (paragraphs 173 and 174), the restriction of the use of health visitors to work requiring their special quali- lications (paragraph 177).    There are certain further recommendations to which it appears to the Minister that local authorities should give special considera- tion.  Instances  are (paragraph  159) shortening the routine period of isolation for uncomplicated cases of scarlet fever, (paragraph 101) the treatment of mild cases of scarlet fever at home, (paragraph 16:2) the practice of terminal disinfection, (paragraph 185) the reservation of institutional  treatment  to those  who cannot be  adequately treated otherwise. -    The Report raises the question of cost of capital construction and of annual  maintenance in respect of various classes of building  baths and washhouses (paragraph 153), mental hospitals (para- graph 163), mental deficiency institutions (paragraph 169), maternity homes (paragraph 178), public assistance institutions (paragraph 210) and generally  (paragraphs  1 S3 and  184) in paragraphs 193-194 certain special observations are made as to comparative statements of cost and as to the need for further action on them by this Ministry.    The question of the appropriate capital  cost  in the case of a mental deficiency colony was exhaustively examined recently by a committee appointed by the Board&quot; of Control under the Chairman- ship of Mr. Walter Hedley,  K.C. (Stationery Office Paper 70-255. 1931). The Minister understands that the Committee has in mind the application of a similar method to  other classes of institutions anil that since maintenance costs are to some extent dependent on capital expenditure they also should be brought under survey.   The Ministerproposes to take  appropriate action on the lines suggested by theCommittee, and at the same time to see how he can most effectivelymeet their  view that further steps should  be  taken by  the ministry to secure adhesion to the standards laid down after  full enquiry. (paragraph 182) and more uniformity in  costs (paragraph  194).   Reference may next be made  to some specific recommendations on points of detail. As regards that in paragraph 148 that the cost
of collecting trade refuse should be a charge on the traders concerned,the position is that local authorites have  power to  charge at their discretion except in the case of hotels, restaurants, etc.   It is right that they should exercise the power unless such exercise would be clearly unreasonable.  As  regards the  recommendation in  para-graph 153 as to the provision of only swimming and slipper baths,other kinds of bath in fact  constitute a very small part of the cost,and there is as yet no  evidence that they need be a source of loss to the rates.   The Minister proposes to scrutinise each  case on its merits and commends that  course to local  authorities.  The recom-mendation in paragraph  loo  as  to infectious diseases hospitals should be borne in mind by local authorities  in connection withthe resurvey of that question and the scheme to be made for each county under the Local Government Act,  1929.  In paragraph 170it is recommended that venereal disease clinics should have separatesessions at which charges are made and that patients in scatteredareas able to pay fees should be advised to obtain  treatment fromselected practitioners supplied  with the necessa^&apos; compounds bythe local authority.  The Minister thinks  that experimental actionon these lines might well be  taken at certain clinics by the authorities concerned and the results reported and considered.  In paragraph179 there are certain recommendations in  regard to the administra-tion of clinics and the supply of milk to which  attention should begiven.  As regards the recommendation in regard to day nurseriesin paragraph ISO,  it  appears  to the Minister that if nurseriescannot be filled  with  children whose  mothers go out to  work,vacancies should  go to children requiring supervision owing  tounsatisfactory  home  conditions.  The  general recommendation in paragraph 191 (2) as to  payment for services rendered involvesamendment of Section 132 of the Public Health Act, 1875.   In paragraphs 186-190  reference is made to the question of thestandardisation and central purchasing of supplies.   The importanceof this matter in the interest at once of  economy and efficiency has been often stressed in the past.   It is recognised and effect given toit by many local authorities and the widest possible extension is obviously desirable.   The remainder of Chapter V, viz., paragraphs 163-171, deals with questions of mental disorder and mental  deficiency, and the minister has accordingly taken the views of the Board of Control  with whomrests the primary responsibility in these matters.   In paragraph 163 there is a recommendation  of principle that thefunctions of the Board  should be restricted to advising on specialistquestions, their  administrative duties  being  discharged  by this ministry.   The whole question of the organisation of the Board of Controland of its relations with this  Ministry was exhaustively consideredby the Royal Commission on Lunacy and Mental  Disorder (Cmd.2,700, 1926).  In the result the Commission proposed certain reforms
in the organisation of the Board and in the relations between it andthe Ministry.  The matter was dealt with accordingly in the MentalTreatment Act,  1930, and  in the  administrative  reorganisationresulting from it, and before any further change is  considered theMinister thinks that it is but reasonable to have experience of theworking of the present arrangements.   It should  of course berealised that, as Minister of Health, he is generally responsible toParliament for the operations of the Board of Control, and that he also exercises certain  specific powers of great importance in regardto those operations as, e.g., the power of loan sanction.   As regards the detailed points made in the Report, the Ministeroffers the following observations :   Paragraph 163. The suggestions as to standards of accommoda-tion will be taken up  in connection with the general enquiry into these matters, above mentioned.  The Minister is assured by theBoard that they would  welcome any less costly methods of con-struction which can be devised,  always provided that risk of fire isnot increased. They will examine carefully the possibility of eeono-economising space in new buildings in existing buildings such economy is liable to lead to more casualties and increase of nursing  staff.   Paragraph 164.  The transfer of harmless  senile patients andmental  defectives from mental hospitals  has been consistentlyurged by the Board on local  authorities.   Paragraph 165. It is the present practice of the Board to giveattention  to  the financial side of occupational  therapy, but wherethe patient is recoverable,  the question of the first importance isthe therapeutic value of the  work.1   Paragraph 166.  The Board agree with the  views  expressed(a) as to the vesting of full financial control in the Council and not inthe Visiting Committee and (6) as to the Minister deciding differences between constituent authorities ,of Joint Committees.  Here alsothe question of amending legislation arises.   Paragraphs 167-171.  In  these  paragraphs attention is veryproperly drawn to the rapid increase in the  cost  of  the mental deficiency service. On this question it must be observed that neitherthe Board of Control nor the Minister could subscribe to the view expressed that there is  no  evidence that more than a  negligiblenumber of the mentally deficient are improved in condition by treat-ment.   The effect of the experience obtained is, in fact, that all buta negligible number show - improvement  after  treatment, both asregards habits, behaviour arid capacity for work.  Further, in con-sidering merely the figures of expenditure in paragraph 168 withoutany allowance for other aspects of the question, it should be borne inmind that provision for mental defectives not treated in institutionsappropriate to them has been, arid is, a large element in the cost ofpublic assistance. These paragraphs cannot,  accordingly, be ac-cepted without material  qualification.  Nevertheless, the Board of
                              7Control and the Minister are equally. desirous of providing for thislately developed and  beneficent service only so much money as isrequisite  for its needs.   It has been already noted that there hasbeen a recent review of standards of  mental  deficiency  (colony)accommodation  by the Hedley   Committee.   It is  considereddoubtful  whether  any further general reduction of the standardslaid  down  by the Board is feasible, though a more extended useof temporary buildings  for certain purposes is under trial.   Theexperience  of  the Board leads them  to doubt whether any lesselaborate  system  of  classification would be economical or workwell.  The figures given by the Wood Committee are in fact borne out by the actual ascertainments in a number of areas, and LocalAuthorities  are accordingly advised to plan the  accommodationultimately needed on  the basis  of those figures, but  actually onlyto build in  stages to  meet immediate  needs.   The  Board agreethat full use should be made of  the system of guardianship andcommend it to local authorities, subject always to the necessity of adequate supervision  if successful results  are to  be obtained.Certain practical difficulties which have hitherto restricted the useof guardianship  cannot, however, be removed without amending legislation.           CHAPTER  VI. PUBLIC ASSISTANCE.   This Chapter raises some very  important  questions of principle,the  power  to  supersede local  authorities  (paragraph 225), thewithdrawal of public assistance to  the able-bodied from the purview of local authorities (paragraph 226), and the placing of public assist-ance and transitional payments  in   the hands  of independentpersons (paragraph 227).  These matters,  in respect of whichdissentient  views  are  expressed in the report,  are closely  related to the problems raised  by the recent report of the Royal Commissionon Unemployment Insurance&apos;, and are being considered  by theGovernment in that  connection.   Further  paragraphs  in the Chapter deal with  amendments  ofthe law.  Such an amendment would be requisite to  give effect tothe recommendation in paragraph 228 (vii)  as to National  HealthInsurance and Friendly Society payments, but the Minister does notconsider such an  amendment practicable.  The recommendations in paragraphs 229 and 231 also  require amendment  of the law.In so far as they refer to insurance benefits and old age pensions, theywould give  rise  to certain difficulties which would require most careful consideration.  Piecemeal  amendment of the Poor Law Act;1930, seems to -the,Minister undesirable and he proposes to deferconsideration of the paragraphs until he has in his hands the resultof the comprehensive examination of  the. statute undertaken bythe-Joint  Committee of the  County Councils Association and association  of Municipal Corporations referred to in paragraph 230.   For the rest, the Chapter enunciates certain principles of soundpublic assistance  to which the Minister is convinced that it was
never more necessary than it is at present that the fullest attention should be paid by all authorities  responsible for public  assistant--.   The circumstances of every person receiving institutional reliefshould be regularly and thoroughly investigated (paragraph 212and paragraph 228) an adequate investigation staff is essential toeconomical administration  of poor relief a person receiving reliefshould not be in as good  a position as he would be if employed- -where scales of relief have been adopted, they should be reviewed in the light of present circumstances, including the reduction in thecost of living the  resources of an applicants family  should be reckoned as those of a single unit there is a large amount of wastecaused by the practice of granting relief automatically to bring an applicant^ income up to an agreed minimum the requirement ofwork as a condition of out-relief to the able-bodied is an economy the practice  of offering, in appropriate cases, institutional insteadof out-relief should  be  revived  and extended.     CHAPTER VII. GENERAL ORGANISATION  AND               FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION.   The Committee estimate the  cost in 1930-1 of salaries and wages of local  authorities  (including   teachers,  police,  and   manual workers, but not persons engaged in the trading undertakings) at approximately  122,000,000.   They  consider that,  leaving outthe  pay  of teachers  and  police,  and assuming that  all localauthorities make deductions with a degree of uniformity on thelines  suggested in  circular letter 1222 of the 11th of September.1931, it should be possible to reduce the wages bill of 1930-1 byabout five millions.  Five members, however, hold  that such ;ireduction must include administrative charges and cannot reason-ably be expected to be produced from salaries and wages alone.   The salaries paid to  certain classes of local  officials as, e.g.,teachers, police, or road officers, are the concern of other Ministers.In regard to the generality of local officers, the salaries and conditionsof employment are, with a few exceptions in the health  and publicassistance services, the sole concern of the local authorities themselves and  the Minister  has no  definite responsibility.  The  matter is,however, of such importance to the well-being and progress of localgovernment that he  cannot but take a deep interest in it and liewould wish to offer certain observations for the careful  considerationof local authorities.   The circular letter of the 11th of September, 1931,  among other things directed the  attention of local authorities to the proprietyof conforming to the action of the central government in the matterof temporary reductions in the emoluments of officials and  urged the desirability of local consultation with the officials on the subject.There has in practice been very  great disparity in the way in whichthis  matter  has been dealt with by authorities.   In some cases
 no reductions appear to have been made at all and in other cases the reductions have been made on very different lines.  This situa- tion seems to the Minister calculated to give rise to dissatisfaction and even  discontent among the  officials.   He thinks that  in the action which local authorities take on this part  of the Report of the Committee  on  Local Expenditure  it is eminently desirable that the fullest  possible use  should be made of the method of con- sultation with the officials commended in the circular of the 11th of September, whether locally, or, as is even more desirable to attain some measure of uniformity of action, centrally,  as, for example, by the use of the central associations of local authorities, or some special committee of  those associations,  to  confer with central organisations of the local officials.    In paragraph  237 the Report makes some suggestions  which appear to  the Minister of great  value.  Numbers of staff should certainly be  re-examined in  the light of present requirements and, the Minister would add. the possibility  of reduction of numbers. by better organisation and improved methods of working should be carefully explored.  The salary scales, particularly, of the higher officers, are recommended by the Committee for review... Essential factors in such a review are how salaries compare with those paid for similar duties  in comparable places (there is very great lack of. uniformity in these matters),  what increase has  been made  since 1914, how the question of the increased cost of living has been dealt with, and what reduction has been made in recent years.  In regard to some classes of officers,  it appears to  the Minister eminently desirable to consider the propriety, either on  the occurrence of a vacancy, or possibly by agreement, of instituting the practice of a- fixed  salary to  cover all work to be performed by  the officer... Generally, the Minister would desire to impress on local authorities that what is needed is not  ill-considered and all-round reduction. of salaries, which  in some of the lower grades often do, not compare, favourably with  what is paid in other public service or outside,; but a cautious  and fair  examination  of the work.to. be;ydon^and,-the remuneration reasonable for that work in  present  conditions..&apos;, If. the matter is handled by authorities in this.sp.irit,&quot; they Minister,-is confident that local officials, whether salaried, jor wage  earners, will,&apos; be  found ready to respond  to the needs of.the  tijneV rL   i.^ ?&apos;-.-&quot;,&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;   Paragraph 238. This point is noted for consideration iwljen^the^next occasion arises  for suitable legislation&quot;..,         I.   Paragraph 239.

   Paragraph 241.  The principle of this recommendation is  fullyaccepted by the Ministry.  Objection is taken to meeting from loanssmall sums spent on capital works. The Minister hopes that  localauthorities will carry out the recommendation to the fullest extent possible without unfairness to present ratepayers.   Paragraph 242.  The Minister welcomes these recommendations in regard to  the periods for loan sanctions.   Paragraph 243.   This recommendation will  be considered furinclusion in a Bill on the next appropriate occasion and with referenceto the question which has been raised as  to the proper  constructionof the existing statutory provision in regard to  county councils.   Paragraph 244.   So far as the Minister is concerned, he would welcome the widest use of  the District Audit staff.  The extensionby statute of the sphere of that staff to all municipal corporationaccounts as  a matter of obligation raises questions of some con-troversy and difficulty, and the Minister may note that a private bill now before Parliament would  deal with the matter  by enablingmunicipal authorities to use the district audit staff if they desireto do so.  Such a desire has been frequently expressed in the  past.   Paragraph 245.   The District Audit  staff will be requested tokeep  possible debt  conversions  carefully under review.              CHAPTER IX. MISCELLANEOUS.   Paragraph 265.   Conferences.   This question is one which has given rise to great difficulty in theMinistry, which is directly concerned in it by reason of the fact thatin many cases the attendance of delegates of local authorities at thecost of the rates requires the sanction of the Ministry under the LocalAuthorities (Expenses) Act, 1887.  The  difficulty of the matter  isnot lessened  by the fact that not all authorities come  within theambit of that Act for this purpose.   The Minister entirely endorses the view of the Committee thatthe number of conferences is far too large,  the intervals between themsometimes too short, and much the same  ground sometimes coveredby more than one conference.-  The difficulty of the matter is that, notably in the sphere ofpublic health, the co-operation of voluntary bodies and  societies  isof very great value and periodical  conferences are a  recognisedmethod of bringing it to bear.   The Committee propose to meet the situation by restricting the attendance of representatives, not more than two for each authority,at the expense of the rates  to conferences convened by the respon-sible associations of local authorities.   Such a restriction appears tothe Minister to go too far, excluding, as it would, valuable and fruit -ful conferences like those, for example, of the national associationsconcerned with tuberculosis or mental welfare.
   It appears to the Minister that the needs of the situation can best be met (a) by a very careful scrutiny locally  and centrally of thenecessity for, and probable value of, any given conference, and (6) bythe restriction  of the  representation of a local authority  to  one person at the charge of the rates, such person to be either a member ofthe authority or an official, at their discretion, and any further repre-sentatives to attend at  their own expense.  Where the conference is convened by  the responsible associations of  local authorities the attendance of two persons at the  charge of the rates  would seemreasonable.  Where the  financial  position of  an authority is bad,the Minister would propose to restrict attendance of a delegate atthe cost of the rates to a limited number of conferences in any year,not to exceed three.   Paragraph 206.   The Minister endorses the view  of the Com-mittee as to the badness of any general practice of charging the ratesin respect of conferences held in the district.   Paragraph 270.   The Ministry have  lost  no  opportunity of pressing  on local authorities the imperative necessity  of reducing expenditure on local enquiries by  such steps as  a fuller use of theirown officers, abstention from retaining counsel and avoidance of unnecessary expert witnesses.  The opportunity and  the need for economy in this matter are equally striking and it deserves the mostserious consideration of local authorities.  For his  part the minister will not fail to give constant consideration to possible improvementsof procedure at enquiries to reduce cost.   Paragraph  271.   The Minister  heartily  concurs as  to  the excessive number of private Bills  presented in the past.  A furtherPublic General Bill will be  introduced as soon as parliamentary and other conditions admit of it.   Paragraphs 272-3.   These recommendations as to  printing andadvertisements require, and are receiving, detailed attention   Paragraph  274.  The recommendation for extension of  thepractice  of making informal  tests of samples of food will be notedby local  authorities, but it should also be noted that this methodincreases the risk that some forms of adulteration may go undetected.   Paragraph 275.  The questions as to Registrars raised in thisparagraph have been discussed with the  Registrar General.   As regards the salary scales themselves, it is the fact  that theywere settled as recently  as 1929 in careful correspondence with thegeneral level of local government officers&apos; salaries then prevailing,which seemed to be the proper standard.  The Minister is not aware of any general change in that standard, though temporary reductions of salary were made in 1931-2.  Objection  is not made to such temporary reductions in the case  of registrars.    On the question of discretion as to salaries for local authoritiesthere are exceptional  features about the work of registrars.  The
work  is identical  and the  central authority takes responsibilityfor it and cannot but aim  at securing a reasonable uniform standardof  competence.   The present provisions were  framed after  longprotests from the  staff,  based largely on disparities which couldnot be defended, and the scale admits of some measure of flexibility.In  the circumstances, the Minister does not  think that any change is  requisite.                                I am, Sir,                                     Your obedient Servant,/Secretary.The Clerk to the Authority.
