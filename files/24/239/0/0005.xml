                  oabtketo       TRADE AKD EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEE *Henorandum by the President of the Board of Trade,    Japanese Competition In the Textile Trade.         I oiroulate herewith a note prepared in my Department on    Japanese competition in Cotton Goods,  So far as competition, in.    foreign markets is conoerned, there i3 no -course which His    Majesty&apos;s Government could take which would he likely to be of    service to mitigate this competition *   The only conceivable remedy    would be the conclusion of a trade arrangement between the    Lancashire and Japanese exporters, if it were practicable - whioh    seems at least unlikely.         On the other hand, competition in the Colonies is a matter    whioh Lancashire represents with considerable force as being one    whioh His Majesty1s Government can and should deal with.  In some    Colonies preference for United Kingdom goods is already in force    tut it appears that in certain of our African Colonies an outright    preference is precluded by our international engagements.  The    Japanese have already acquired such a hold in East Africa that it    would be difficult to oust them, but in West Africa there is yet    time to aot.   Accordingly in the attaohed note it is suggested    that steps should be taken on behalf of our West African Colonies :    to withdraw from the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty in order that    they should be in a position to withhold most-favoured-nation    treatment in future from Japan.         I do not advocate denunciation of the Treaty as suoh.  Ho such    course is, in faot, necessary, as the Treaty can be kept in being    even though the West African Colonies themselves withdraw.  I    understand that these Colonies do not themselves enjoy any practical    advantage in Japan.as a result of their adhesion to the Treaty,    whereas the United Kingdom has a substantial trade with Japan for    whioh the maintenance of the Treaty affords a measure of security.

	1931		1932 (11 months		l&apos;OC-0 so., yds.		1,413,780		1,021,095	1,716,342		2,002,213     It must, however, be borne in mind that the United kingdom exports in 1931 were at an extremely low level.  The exports from japan have been increasing progressively year by year.     It is urged by&quot;Lancashire that the prices at which theJapanese are able to offer their goods are a severe threat totheir markets, and that it is essential that some assistance should be given to Lancashire in British territory.   3. Lancashire^ markets for cotton piece goods can be divided under four headings:-       (a) Foreign markets.       (b) Dominion markets (including India).       (c) Colonial markets in which Imperial Preference            has been or can be introduced.       (d) Colonial ro.ar.kets 1x3 which, owing to treaty            obligations: Imperial Preference cannot            be introduced^.              JAPANESE CaiPttJITION IH COTTON GOODS.    1. Japane-se competition has become an Increasingly seriousmenace in our export markets during the past year, as a resultlargely of the depreciation of the yen added to the already low wages.  There is no evidence that this competition is fosteredby any Government subsidy;.  Although other industries such as thesilk and artificial silk industry have also complained of japanese competition &quot;by far the most important British interest affected isthe Lancashire cotton industry, and this memorandum is confined toa consideration of the facts relating to the competition experiencedby that industry in export markets-.   2.   It cannot be argued from the figures that Japanese exportsof cotton goods as a whole have gained materially during 1952 atthe expense of United Kingdom exports, the figures being as follows:                   Exports of cotton piece goods.
     As regards (a)  the  cotton  tr^de is in  th- forefront of our  present negotiations with certain foreign countries but there is no action that  .an ho  taken to deal specifically with Japanese  competition, unless some arrangement  can bt, come to with the Japanese by  official action or  otherwise  in the direction of division of markets.     At regards (b), any as^i. tance that the Dominions were prepared to give to  U0X. cotton goods was given  m  the Agreements at Ottawa.  In India a substantial increase in the  preference enjoyed by U.E. cotton goodi- over foreign goods  was introduced in August last,, the  prefer-inco  amounting to 25 per  cent, ad valorem.  U.IL exports of cotton goods to India, Australia and New Zealand increased substantially in  19 32*     (c)  The grant  of preference toocotton goods in  the Colonies is a matter for the Colonial Office^ and in many cases hau  already been granted.  The  Government of Ceylon, however, hat.  not agreed to give a preference to lancashir, cotton goods; and  Ceylon is one of the markets in which there  was a decrease of exports from the  U.K. in 19-32,,     (d)  The markets in which  Imperial preference  is precludedby Treaties in force are the 3ast African Colonies, and the&quot;vest African Colonies of Uigeria and the Gold Coasto     4.   In Jjast Africa,  Japan  already has  the bulk of the tradeand last year v/as still gaining ground^  in spite of a small increase in imports from the  U.K.   These territories are at presentprevented from affording a preference to British goods by the 3tcGermain  Convention of 1919,  to which Japan is a party.  They arealso parties  to the Anglo-Japanese treaty.   It would not bepossible to introduce discrimination against Japanese goods inthese territories without first  calling a Conference to bring theit.  German Convention to  an end; it would also b-; necessary forthe Colonies  to Y/ithdraw  from  the Anglo-Japanese treaty.   Apartfrom general  questions  of policy-;,  two  main objections to the course
of abrogating the St9 Germain Convention are that it wouldtake a considerable time, possibly years,  and that,  sinco theJapanese are already well-established in East Africa,  it isdoubtful whether any preference which would not be regardedas imposing too great a burden on the native population wouldbe- sufficient to reinstate Lancashire goods,,     5.  Lancashire^ chief concern at prosent i s to prevent0&quot;apan from securing the valuable Vest African market ae shohac; already secured the East African market; and it is in these colonies that the possibility of action is being examined^The value of the exports of cotton piece-goods from the U.K.to these Colonies in 1932 was about  3,000s000.     6.  Lancashire state that, although Japanese imports intoVest Africa are not yet very large, Japan is now offering tosupply merchants at such very low prices that they will be driven to obtain their supplies from Japan unless they know that action is going to be taken to safeguard the position,The great bulk of the cotton trade in West Africa is in thehands of merchants, the goods being sold locally on themarks of those merchants, and it would be a comparativelysimple matter for them to change their source of supply.There appears to be no reason to question what Lancashiresay, or that once the trade is lost there will be little hopoof regaining it.  Pour ways of meeting the competition havebeen suggested; -     (a)  The abrogation of the Anglo-French Convention by whichFrench goods (and thos;&amp; of all other cou.o.tries enjoying most-favoured-nation rights) have the righ1: to equal treatment with&quot;British goods in the matter of import duties.  Even if thisConvention were abrogated., there is a possibility that theNetherlands (and consequently any country enjoying most-fa vourod-nation treatment) would be able to claim equaltreatment with this country in part of V/est Africa at least.                               -3-
     This proposal hes now boon abandoned by Lancashire infavour f*f either (c) or (d) below.     (b) An approach to the Japanese Ambassador p?inting *?utto him the strong feeling that is being caused by japanese competition in British markets and threatening retaliatory-action  if it is not stopped.  The Foreign Office have takenobjection to this course on the ground that it is politicallyinadvisable at the present time, but undertook to consider thequestion again in two months time, i.e., et the end bf March.In these circumstances, the two following possible courses havealso been explored.     (o) That the West African colonies should free themselvesfrcm the Anglo-Japanese treaty (this they can do by givingtwelve  months notice), when they would be free to imposediscriminatory duties against Japanese goods.     (d) That the Colonies generally should adopt the policy ofadhering only tc treaties from which they derive a directbenefit, end that steps should be taken to withdraw (so far asthey are concerned) from  treaties of no direct advantage  tothem at an  early date.  The Colonies would then  introduce a two column  Tariff  (apart  from Imperial preference) and grant the advantages *f the lower column only to those oountrlestc which they mainteined  treaty  obligations.   In this way,  also,Japan would be penalised,  but she would probably not be theonly country ta pay the highest  rate of duty.     Proposals  (c)  and  (d) were  considered et  s  meeting at  theBoard of Trsde on the 22nd February.   It was felt, however,that on treaty grounds  the  adoption of  the  .atter policy  might make  it difficult  in  the  future  to  maintain  intact the  clause
in cur commercial treaties which ensures-equel treatment toall British subjects, end also that it might be difficult to persuade foreign countries in the future to egree to thearrangement by which any Colony is permitted to adhere tca treaty by simply giving notice to the foreign country concerned;  further, that this method would net in factavoid the necessity of taking discriminatory action primarilyagainst japan as in fact Japan would probably be the onlyimportant country effected.     It was accordingly felt that, on the whole, course (c)appeared to be the least objectionable way of meeting thesituation.  It entails a possible risk that Japan mightretaliate by denouncing the whole Anglo-Japanese treaty;but it seems unlikely that she would in fact do this, as she would not   wish to endanger her own valuable market in theU.K. and in some other parts of the Empire.  It vos decidedto examine the possibilities of action on these lines further,end the Board of Trade have taken the preliminary step ofenquiring whether the Foreign Office see any over-ridingpolitical objections to this course.Board of Trade,     1st Heroh, 1953,W.R.
