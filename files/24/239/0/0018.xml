This document is  the  property  of  His Britannic  Majesty&apos;s Government.                  Printed for the Cabinet, March, 1933SECRET.                                                                  COPT No. OQCJP. 68 (33).THE CABINETTHE  ARMY  AND AIR  FORGE  (ANNUAL)  BILL      MEMORANDUM BY  THE  SECRETARY  OF STATE FOR WAR     I circulate  herewith  the Army and Air Force (Annual)  Bill.   There are  no   0161amendments to the Army Act.   The amendments of the Air Force Act provide :        6144     (1)  that when any body of  the  Royal Air Force is acting  with any body of the           Indian Air  Force, a member of the one Force  may, by regulations to be           made by the Air Council  and the Governor-General, be given the powers           of command over members of the other  Force  which he would have if he           were a member of the other  Force of relative rank ; and     (2)  that officers or airmen of the Indian Air Force when  attached to the Royal           Air Force outside India shall  be subject to the Air Force Act, subject to           exceptions to be laid down in regulations made by the Air Council and the           Governor-General.     The purpose of  Part (1) of these amendments is to regulate the status of officersof the new Indian Air Force in relation  to the Royal  Air Force in India.  The officers-of the new Indian Air Force are to be given the same &quot; Dominion &quot; type of commission as the cadets who are being trained at the Indian Military  Academy for appointment to the Indian Army, and the same problem of the status of  these officers in  relation toBritish officers and other ranks will arise equally in the case  of the  Army.   But thereare important differences, e.g., the Indian Air Force is being raised as a purely Indianforce from the  start, whereas  in  the  case of the  Army  the  status  of the new indian officers requires to be regulated in relation to British officers and other ranks of theIndian Army as well  as of  the British  Army in India.   As at  present advised, I am inclined to think that the problem in the Army can best be dealt with at the outset bydelegating authority  to the  Commander-in-Chief in India to  give such  powers of command as the situation may from  time to time require ;  but it is not an  immediate problem, as the output of the new type  Indian Army officer from the Indian  MilitaryAcademy will  not   commence  until  October,  1934, and   I  propose  to   defer any amendment to the Army Act which may be found necessary until next  year.   In themeantime, as I  understand  that  the  Indian Air Force begins to form  next  April andthe Air Ministry consider it necessary to take  powers to deal with the situation  at once,I raise no objection to what  the Air Ministry propose to do, provided that the Secretaryof State for India is  content, and on  the understanding that the War  Office will  begiven the opportunity of considering any regulations for  the exercise of mutual powersof command between the Royal  Air  Force and the Indian Air  Force before  they aremade, in case they should prejudice the Army position.     As regards Part (2) of the Air Ministry&apos;s amendments, I understand that  the india Office see some objection to bringing Indian other ranks, as distinct from  officers,under an alien code  of discipline when attached to British Army or Royal Air force units, but that, to the limited  extent here proposed, the)&apos; are prepared  to agree to it.The question of making a similar  provision in the case  of the Army may have to  beconsidered in due course.     The Bill must receive the Royal Assent  by the  end of  April,  and it is necessarythis  year that it should pass through  all the stages before Easter.  1 therefore ask the concurrence of my colleagues in the immediate circulation of the Bill.

        INTRODUCTORY  MEMORANDUM.                     Clause 4.    The Government of India have decided that stepsshall be taken at once to commence the formation of thenew Indian Air Force.  The personnel of this force will beIndian and provision for its discipline has been made byan Act of the Indian Legislature the Indian Air ForceAct,  1932.    It is  necessary, however,  to make  provision toregulate the relations between members of the new forceand members of the Roj^al Air Force when units of thetwo  forces are  doing duty  at the same  station or are otherwise  serving together,  and also  to make provisionfor the discipline of members of the  Indian  force whenattached to the Royal Air Force.   Subsection  (1)  deals with the first  point on linessimilar to those of section  184A  of the Air Force Actwhich  governs  the relations between air,  naval andmilitary forces when acting together, and subsections (2)to (4) deal with the second  point by making personnelattached to the Royal  Air  Force subject as a general rule to the Air Force Act when outside India.
