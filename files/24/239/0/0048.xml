REPORT.    1.  THE Third Annual report of the Air Raids Precautions (Organisation)Sub-Committee* was approved by the Committee of  Imperial Defence  at ameeting held on the 22nd March, 1932.t    2.  In our last report* we referred to the preparation of a Manual for the instruction of the Civil Population against gas which had been prepared by the chemical  Defence Research Committee.  This Manual! was also considered bythe Committee of Imperial Defence at its meeting held on the 22nd March, 1932,1when  it was agreed         &quot; To approve the  Manual for the Instruction of the Police, Decontam-    ination  Personnel, &amp;c.  (C.I.D.  Paper  No. 185-A),  and  to  authorise a    confidential  distribution  of   this  Manual,  not  only  to  Government    Departments,  but to responsible officials  of big utility undertakings, and to    selected local authorities whose co-operation m schemes for the defence of    the civil population was essential.&quot;    In accordance with this recommendation we have made arrangements for alimited confidential distribution, and  also, to supply such selected authorities asmay from time to time require the  information contained in this Manual.  It is,perhaps, not without interest, to record that the Canadian Government has askedfor, and has been sent a small number of copies  for confidential circulation.    3.  We are again glad to report considerable progress in our work;  but,before proceeding to a general account of our activities, we should like to set on record our appreciation of the work of our late Chairman, Sir  John Anderson,who, until he left to take up another distinguished appointment in India,  hadbeen associated with the work of the  Air  Raids  Sub-Committees from theirinception.    We feel we owe Sir John Anderson  a debt of gratitude,  not  only  for theinterest which he took in the subject of Air Raids Precautions,  but also for suchprogress as  we have been able to make in grappling with this complex subject.His foresight,  his grasp of the essentials of the problem and his energy  anddriving power have been invaluable to us.    4.  We should also like to record our appreciation of the work of another oldand distinguished member of  the Sub-Committee,  Sir Charles Hipwood, whorecently retired to take up  an appointment outside the Government Service.    5.  The general work of the Sub-Committee  has covered considerable groundduring the past year, and in the succeeding paragraphs it is  proposed  briefly to describe the  most important matters which have been under consideration : (a) Scheme of Compensation for Personal Injury.    6.  In  our last report  we  recorded  that a Sub-Committee  had  beenconstituted to prepare a practical scheme of compensation.  We understand fromthe Chairman of this Sub-Committee that meetings have  been held at regular intervals and very material progress has been made; it is  hoped, in fact, to beable to render a report at the end of this year which will contain the basis of ageneral scheme.    * C.I.D.

             (b)  Organisation of Air Raids Precautions Services.     7.  We  have  recently  had under  review the  form  of  administrativeorganisation on which the working of the Air Raids Precautions Sub-Committeeshas so far been based; this organisation  was made the subject of a report* to theCommittee of  Imperial Defence in  1928 and received  their  approval,!  andsubsequently also the approval of the cabinet     8.  This subject,  which is one  of outstanding  importance,  has  beenconsidered from time to time in the light of experience gained and certain doubtshave arisen as to whether,  in fact, the proposals which were originally submittedand  approved will be found1 to be  the most practicable and efficient in the long run.     9.  We  do not intend to enlarge on this matter here,  as we are dealingwith it in a separate report, g                           (c) Anti-Gas Measures.     10.  Under  this heading we are able to record  considerable progress  in anumber of directions:  (i) Provision of  Gas Masks.     The  situation  in  regard  to the  provision  of gas  masks  for the  civilpopulation has reached a  stage  at  which it may be convenient to give  a more detailed review of the position  than is normal in an annual report.     At the beginning  of the year it was reported to us that the work on thepreliminary  stages of  design had advanced to a point wrhen  it was necessaryto come to some decision as to the standards of protection to be provided.  after some consideration  it  was agreed  to  divide  the  Civil  population into three categories :       (A) Personnel  who would  be  employed in the maintenance  of essential           services,  e.g., police,  fire brigades, decontamination squads, &amp;c, and           who  might, in consequence, be  liable to  exposure  to  heavy  and           continuous concentrations  of gas.     (B)  Personnel required for important services, e.g.,  public  utility under-           takings,  &amp;c, but  who.  while liable  to  exposure  to gas, would  be           unlikely  to  have to operate under such severe conditions  as  those in           Category (A) above.     (C)  The Civil population generally.     Based on these assumptions, it was  then agreed that the degree of protectionwhich should be provided for the personnel of these three Categories could be assessed as follows :       Category (A). The fullest  protection possible, as provided in the respirator         issued to, or held for, the fighting services.     Category (B). Protection sufficiently reliable  to enable them to withstand         concentrations of gas for moderate  periods.     Category (C). Temporary  protection.     The service  pattern respirator,  besides  providing the maximum protection against gas,  also reduces to a minimum  the \oss of personal efficiency  inseparable from working in an apparatus  of this kind :  a very  important point.  Withtrained personnel this loss of efficiency is from 20-25 per cent.  A respiratorof this pattern,  complete  with  all  accessories,  costs approximately   1, and itis hoped that this cost may be reduced to 17s. Qd.\\     For personnel under Category (B), a respirator has been designed which itis proposed  to fit with a  container  giving the equivalent of  about l/10th theprotection of the service container, and also tending to increase, though not toany  great extent, the loss of personal efficiency.     From  the information at our disposal, we are satisfied that a respirator ofthis type will provide sufficient protection for personnel not required to operate    * G.I.D. Paper  No. 102-A.               ! G.I.D. 289th Meeting. Minute G.    J Cabinet 2 (29), Conclusion 13.          5 C.I.D. Paper No. 188-A.    ;( This is the cost price of  production by the Government factory; it must not ba  taken as.being necessarily the cost if supplied by private manufacture.
under  all conditions.  Such a respirator  is estimated to cost from  2s. 6d. to4s. 6c?. completed    The question  of providing a respirator for the civil population  generallyhas been discussed.  Until it has been  possible to make provision  for personnelcoming under Categories (A) and (B), there can be no  question,  we  think, of attempting  to  meet the  needs  of Category  (C) personnel,  even  if it shouldultimately  be decided  that  some effort  in  this direction  is required.   We havereached the provisional conclusion, however, that the first object must be to induce the general public to stay indoors in a  room suitably gas proofed in accordancewith instructions; or, in addition, perhaps, to allow them to purchase gas masksthemselves, though some control  would obviously be required, not only to preventfraud, but to see that only officially-approved patterns were allowed to be on sale.t    We are  not blind to the fact that, in time of war,  the Government mightbe forced, by pressure  of  public opinion, to attempt to make a general provisionof gas masks; at the present moment, however, the really important desideratumis to ensure  a supply  for those on whom  the maintenance of the  vital services-will depend.    We next turned our  attention to the production side of this question.   Weunderstand that,  apart  from the existing service respirator,  it  is  hoped tocomplete the design of a new face-piece and a  new container  for supply to thefighting services by 1935-36, this specification being the one which it is proposedto adopt for  Category  (A) personnel.    The respirator for Category (B) personnel is also being developed as quickly as possible and should be  ready, we believe, by 1934.    We have made representations to the War Office to expedite the work on theproduction of the final specifications of these  two types of  respirators, but wefully appreciate the difficulties  and realise that it is  advantageous, from every point Of view, to produce as efficient a model as possible rather than to risk issuiuga final specification which may prove unsatisfactory under the testing conditionsof constant use.    We have, further, been in touch with the Principal Supply Officers committee as to the question  of bulk production and the actual estimates of the numbers ofrespirators which may be  required.   The provisional  estimate given for theLondon area  was as follows :              Category  (A)       ...       ...       ...     100,000             Category  (B)       ...       ...       ...     500.000    In addition,  the Principal Supply Officers Committee were warned of thepossibility of a demand for a more general supply of respirators in time of war.We have not yet  received any  observations on these  estimates, though we aregiven  to understand that the&quot; Government Respirator Assembly Factory  has a capacity on mobilisation sufficient only to meet the needs of the Fighting Services.    We also drew the attention of the Principal Supply Officers  Committee tothe question  of  the supply of component parts of respirators,  and in particular to the possibility of  heavy demands  for activated charcoal  for use in thecontainers.  This&apos;aspect is important, since we understand that sources of activecarbon in this country are very limited  and the majority of commercial supplies are imported from foreign countries.    A further problem in connection with the design and supply of respiratorswas raised during an examination of the anti-gas measures required for telephoneexchanges, and  it was found that it would be necessary to make provision for a supply of  respirators  for  female workers.   The  majority will  require onlyCategory (B) protection, but a  small  supply of Category (A)  respirators  willprobably be needed as  well.  The necessary steps have been taken to ensure thatthese requirements are considered in the experimental work now proceeding.    Finally, it  may be noted that towards the end of the summer  arrangements were made for experiments to be carried out with service personnel in order togive preliminary tests to the Category (B) respirator, which had reached sufficientfinality in experimental  design to enable  a small  number to  be manufactured.The l-esiiits of these tests are extremely satisfactory;  the efficiency  being higherthan was anticipated.                 * Sets footnote on page 4.                  &apos; This method is practised by the Italian Government.

     It  is satisfactory to record, therefore, that very definite progress has beenmade during the past year in the design and manufacture of both Categories ofrespirators; sufficient, in fact,  to  warrant  the  consideration of  questions ofproduction and supply.  We are paying especial attention to this very importantside of our work, and are endeavouring, in close co-operation with the War Office,to combine civil and service needs, not only with the object of reducing expense,but  also to facilitate production and distribution  when  finality  of  design is achieved.     It is proposed, at a later date,  if present progress is maintained,  to rendera special report on this subject, containing our considered opinion on the policyof the provision  and  supply of respirators for the civil population.(ii)  Anti-Gas Protection for Telephone Exchanges.     A  somewhat detailed investigation  was  undertaken to see  what,  if any,arrangements could be made to render certain key  telephone exchanges gas-proof,and  a valuable report was rendered to the Committee on this matter.     Without going into too much detail, it may be said that, so far as automaticexchanges are concerned, there will  be no very great difficulties  in the  way ofproviding anti-gas protection, and  plans have been formulated  accordingly inco-operation with the Chemical Defence Research  Department.     The problem of  protecting  the  manual  type of exchange presented moredifficulties, and it was finally  decided that  the only practical solution  was toprovide  individual in place of collective  protection&quot;. Arrangements have beenmade accordingly to estimate the number of respirators required for operators inmanual exchanges and,  as already noted  in  (i) above, to carry out trials withrespirators with a view to their adaptation for use by female workers.     It will be seen, therefore, that the important  question of anti-gas protection for key telephone exchanges is receiving careful attention.(iii)  Supply and Storage of Bleaching Powder.     The question of the supply and storage of bleaching powders is of importancein connection  with decontamination work, since bleaching powder is one of  themost satisfactory decontamination agents.     We have had a   report on  the results of trials by the Chemical defence research Committee,  and we  have also  gone  into  the productive capacity of manufacturers in this country.     As a result of our enquiries we are endeavouring to form a rough estimate ofthe quantities of bleaching powder likely to be required, and we then propose to notify the Principal Supply  Officers Committee, so that  they  may consider what steps to take to ensure the requisite supplies are available in an emergency.(iv)  Use of Underground Garages as Gas-Proof Shelters.     Our attention was directed to the fact that plans were being formulated  forthe construction of underground garages, and that, in fact, one such garage had actually been  constructed at Hastings, and  that such buildings might  possessvalue as shelters against gas attack.     We have made certain enquiries, and we feel that there might be possibilities in this direction, not  only for providing gas-proof, but also bomb-proof shelters.Much Avould naturally depend on the design and construction of such garages,but we have asked the Ministry of Transport to bear our requirements in mind.especially the possibility of being able to incorporate certain anti-gas or anti-bombfeatures in any new construction that might be contemplated.iy)  Protection of Underground and Tube Statio7is from Gas.     In  our last annual  report we stated that it was hoped  to arrange  for the incorporation  of  certain anti-gas measures in the new Tube Extension Stationsthen in course of construction.     It is satisfactory  to be able to report that anti-gas precautions can be taken at stations on the Einsbury Park extension with  little difficulty.  particular attention was  also paid to the possibility of contamination by Mustard Gas spray;it is thought that no  danger need be apprehended from  this direction.  Certainallied problems are, however, being further investigated.
      (d)  Scheme for the Organisation and Protection of the London Docks.     11.   The last report*  on the London  Docks, by  what was  known  as  the &quot;London Committee,&quot;  was issued in 1924,  and, although containing a mass of important information  in  regard to supplies, storage capacity, &amp;c, did  not attempt nor, in fact, was intended to treat of the problem of providing protection against air attack in  this vital  area.   Accordingly  we felt the time was  not inopportune to initiate investigations into this aspect of the problem, and, after preliminary discussions, we  invited Lord  Ritchie and  Sir David  Owen,  the Chairman and General  Manager of the London Docks, to confer with us, with the  object, not only of  reviewing the general situation,  but of formulating practical  plans  for the  defence of that area controlled by the  Port  of London Authority which  embraces  the London,  Mill wall, Victoria and Albert.  India, Tilbury and Surrey Commercial Docks.     12.   We  should like to record that we received  the greatest sympathy and assistance from Lord Ritchie, Sir David Owen and other officials concerned, so much  so,  in  fact, that a skeleton plan has now been  drawn  up,  has been considered by  us, and is in process of being completed  in detail.     The organisation of the various services has been worked out, the possibilities of providing protection, both  for personnel and material, have been investigated, and arrangements made to augment the Docks services and to link them up, where necessary, with outside organisations.     13.   At the request of the Port of London Authority,  certain members of the Committee visited the  London Docks and gave expert advice as to the provision of shelters and the suitability of existing buildings.  The services of other experts were also placed at the disposal of the Authorities as required.     14.   The  formation of these plans has now cleared the way to an  extent sufficient  for us to be able to  consider the major problem of the maintenance of food and  other supplies in time of war,  and  it is probable  that, in due course, we shall submit our detailed proposals under this head for consideration.            (e)  Use of War Vessels or  Merchant-Ships as Shelters.     15.   During our investigation into the  situation of  the London Docks  theuse of  either obsolete warships or merchant-vessels as  shelters was suggested as a means  of supplementing the rather limited facilities available in the Docks.     We investigated this suggestion in  some detail.  We  found that it might be possible to employ merchant-ships for this purpose, though the cost of preparationmight  be  rather heavy; warships, on the other &quot;hand, presented  more difficulties, though anti-gas protection could follow the standard practice in  the Navy to-day. Presumably, somewhat  similar arrangements could  be adapted  for use in a merchant-ship.     16.   We do not definitely contemplate the employment of merchant-ships as shelters at present, but we have now skeleton plans available and we shall bear in mind that, in default of other  and better arrangements, the use of merchant-ships might  not be without value in an emergency.                         (f)  Anti-Fire  Organisation.     17.   At our request the Fire Adviser to the Home Office, Lieutenant-ColonelG. Symonds, has prepared a comprehensive review of the organisation  for, and possible methods of, combating fires caused by enemy air attacks.     18.   This report dealt specifically with problems connected with the means tobe  taken  to prevent the spread of fires, availability of  water  supplies,  the provision of rescue gear and the creation of fire breaks.     19.   As a result of the information which Colonel Symonds had been goodenough to collect, we were able to form  an appreciation of the situation, and we have asked him to prepare a detailed scheme based on the framework he suggested.     20.   The  position  generally is not unsatisfactory though  a  good deal  of preparatory organising work will be necessary; we are satisfied, however, that it will be possible to produce a practical scheme and that with proper organisation                           * 0.1.1). Paper No. 132-A.
sthe necessary reinforcements should be available.  It is essential, however, that,.once the detailed plan is completed, it must be brought to the confidential noticeof those who will be responsible for its practical application.  With this end inview we have authorised Colonel Symonds to consult certain of the London fire brigade Authorities with the idea, at a later stage, of co-opting also the necessarylocal organisations.    We have also  arranged for co-operation with the Ministry of  Health inrespect of  the supply of  fire-pumps to local authorities, and also to ensure thenecessary  co-ordination with  any  decontamination  arrangements,  since fire-fighting and decontamination will inevitably overlap in certain dilutions.            (g)  Enrolment of Personnel for Anti-Aircraft Services.    21.  It will be remembered that  we submitted an interim report in  1930*recommending that the control and administration of personnel for anti-aircraftservices  to supplement civilian  labour should be undertaken by the War Office.and that that Department, after first demurring to this suggestion, finally agreedto accept the responsibility; and it was recommended at the 252nd Meeting of theCommittee of Imperial Defence that the Departments concerned should work outthe necessary schemes accordingly.    22.  We have  been in consultation with the War Office on this matter,  andhave furnished  that  Department with an estimate of our requirements.   Weunderstand that certain preliminary  arrangements  have been made on  ourestimates.  Further details as to training and the provision of any necessary equipment  will be discussed and settled as they arise.                         .                (h) Protection  of Factories in or near London.    23.  During discussions connected with the policy of  Evacuation, attention was given to the requirements of factories situated in or near London and whichmight  be  required for essential war work,  and particularly to the questionwhether such  factories might  not need some form of protection against  high explosive and gas attack from the air.    24.  It was decided to take up  this question  with the Principal supply officers Committee, and as soon  as investigations are completed it can be decidedwhat,  if any.  action is  desirable or possible to  minimise  the risk of theirproductive capacity being seriously impaired or even destroyed in time  of war.                                (i)  War Book.    25.  We have  had under discussion, at various times, the question of how best to co-ordinate,  not only the great mass of material which the Committee hascollected, but also the many and  divers activities which the work of protecting thecivil population entails.    26.  After consideration, we came to the conclusion that  this could best bedone by means of a War  Book,  drawn up on the same lines as those War Bookswhich  have formed the basis of Departmental Co-operation and Co-ordinationsince before the War.    A preliminary  draft  of an Air Raids Precautions War Book has, therefore,been prepared,  and  the  different  sections will  be  enlarged and completed as circumstances permit.  We feel that this book will prove of great value, and will contribute  to the smooth working of the whole machinery  if and when the timearrives for it to be set in motion.                          (j) Policy of Evacuation.    27.  The question as to how far and to what extent it may be desirable ornecessary to adopt a policy of evacuation  for the population of London is one thathas been exercising  us for some time.  It  is a very vital question and one on whichthe pi&apos;eparation of a number of Schemes depends.                      * C.I.D. Papers No?. 178-4 and 179-A.
    28.  We are of the opinion that, in framing a policy on this matter, thefollowing guiding  principles might form  a convenient  basis  from which towork :     (a) It is desirable to evacuate  as many  persons  from London as possible,           partly in order to help maintain the morale of those remaining in the           danger area, partly to facilitate the task of maintaining the essential           population of London, and partly  to reduce casualties;    (b) It will be essential  to carry out such evacuation as quickly  as possible           after the outbreak of war, if it has not been possible to take action in           the Precautionary Stage.    (c) Women and children, aged and helpless persons should be encouraged to           leave London first, not under compulsion, though steps should be taken           to offer every facility and inducement  for them to  leave.    (d) A voluntary exodus on an unknown scale must be expected, and this will           need to be controlled.  The best  method of exercising control will           probably be through the medium of control of available transport.    29.  It is  proposed to  reconvene the special Sub-Committee to work outdetailed plans for Evacuation, and it may be found desirable to submit a special report at a later date.                           (k) Foreign Activities.    30.  In our last annual report we drew attention to the activities in  foreigncountries  in connection with schemes for the protection of the civil populationagainst air attack.  During 1932 the information which we  have accumulatedgoes to show that not only are these activities increasing, but that in the majorityof cases the organisation  has  been worked  out in complete detail and beensubmitted to practical tests.    31.  We have  received  from France a handbook of passive aerial  defence with six Annexes (on sale to the public) which has been prepared by the Ministryof the  Interior, and which -outlines the complete organisation and  fixes theresponsibility for the  preparation of practical schemes down  to the Mayors ofsmall towns. We have also received  reports of exercises with the civil populationof the  Pas-de-Calais and of Dijon, Lyons aud Marseilles.    32.  It is  evident that the appointment of Marshal  Petain to  control theaerial  defence of France has not only stimulated interest, but has resulted in thewhole organisation being completed  in remarkably quick time.    33.  Activities in Germany have been  no less than in France, and compre-hensive schemes of defence,  embracing every section and activity of the country,have been prepared and subjected to practical test on numerous occasions.    34.  The latest complete organisation comes  from Holland.  This, like theFrench Scheme, fixes responsibility  for the preparation of schemes, &amp;c, on  allthe various local and other authorities.    35.  We would particularly draw attention to the fact that, in all  foreigncountries, the utmost publicity prevails and is, in fact, encouraged.  In  dealingwith schemes of this  kind  which concern  the civil population,  it is  obviouslyimpossible to carry them beyond a certain point without enlisting the co-operationof the public.  So  far. in this country, we have  been at great pains to  concealthe fact that we are taking any action at  all, and, as a result, we are laggingfar behind other  countries whose need  is, perhaps,  less in  the  practical application of  the many paper schemes which  have been prepared or are nowin course of preparation.    36.  We have  drawn particular attention  to this point because  we aresubmitting  a special report* asking to be  given  greater freedom of action, inorder to complete our preparations,  which have been considerably hampered anddelayed by reason of the need for secrecy.

Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.  April 1933.SECRET.                                              Copy  No.  31COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the DRAFT Minutes of the 2&amp;&amp;th Meeting, held on April 6, 1933.        ******                    5. AIR  RAIDS PRECAUTIONS.                         (C.I.D. Paper No. 191-A.)     (Previous reference :  C.I.D. Minutes of the 255th Meeting, Minute 9.)     THE COMMITTEE  had under consideration the  Fourth Annual Report (C.I.D. Paper No.  191-A)  of  the  Air  Raids  Precautions  (Organisation) Sub-Committee.     THE PRIME MINISTER said he understood there were no special points in connection with this Report, but it was very satisfactory to note the amount of. progress that had been made.     SIR JOHN GILMOUR drew particular attention to  paragraph 3 of the Report, where an appreciation of the work  of the  late Chairman, Sir John Anderson, was set out.     SIR RUSSELL SCOTT said he thought the Report spoke for itself, but he would like to mention that the question of finance was coming very much to the front and would  have to be faced before very long.  It would,  he thought, be necessary to make provision on a suitable scale in peace  time for material.  The question did not arise in the Report nor at the present moment, but he would just like to draw the attention of the Committee to  this aspect of the situation.    THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that  the Report should be approved and should be forwarded to the Cabinet for their information.                               CONCLUSION.    THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE approved the Fourth Annual Report        of the Air  Raids Precautions  (Organisation)  Sub-Committee (C.I.D.        Paper No. 191-A)  and directed that it should be  forwarded to  the        Cabinet for their  information.        ******2,  Whitehall Gardens, S. W. 1,       April 6, 1933.[8441-3]
