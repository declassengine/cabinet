THIS DOCUMENT IS TUB  1&apos;TiOPERTY  OF HIS  BRITANNIC HAJSSTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT.*33)                       CABINET.                   Copy  No. ft$.                  Report  of  Committee  on Local  Expenditure.        Note  &quot;by Minister  of  Health  covering proposed circular  to                         Local Authorities.                                  .              I circulate for the information of  my  colleagues a   circular  which I  propose to  send to  Local Authorities  on those   recommendations of  the Ray Committee on Local Expenditure  which   directly  concern  the  Ministry of Health.              The  Bill  now before Parliament  is in conformity  with the   recommendations of  the Committee as  to  the  termination of   housing subsidies other  than those provided for  slum  clearance etc.   under  the Act  of  1930 and for rural  housing.  The  recommendations   made as to Public Assistance to some extent cover  matters  of   principle now  under Cabinet  consideration in  connection with the   Report of the  Royal Commission  on Unemployment Insurance.              The  Report  (para.17)  speaks of determined efforts&quot;   that would &quot;enable  Local Expenditure falling  on  rates  and  grants   to be  reduced  from  35 to 40  million  pounds  within  three years&quot;   from 1929/30.   I  doubt this  estimate, and whether  I could  justify   it to  the Local Authorities.  In any event  I  do  not think  that   it would  be either  useful or wise at the  present moment to address   another circular  to Local Authorities containing merely general   exhortations to economy.              On the  other hand, there are  in the Report various   suggestions for better and more careful administration and these   I  am commending to  local  authorities.  These  are mostly matters   in regard to which  economy is expected to follow from  improvements   in administration.  The  circular gives general guidance to local   authorities thereon and,  in  particular, (l) stresses the need                                -1-
     for new  developments  in health provision and indicates that     these can and should  &quot;be financed &quot;by savings (page 3);     (2) traverses certain views expressed &quot;by the Committee     adverse  to the Mental Deficiency Service,  (page 6).                                   (Intld.)  E.H.Y.2nd March,  1933.
   CIRULAR 1311WILL BE FOUND AFTER    CP 53 (33)
