W.R.ST.. 70(33) .Board of Trade,   16th March, 1933..
     DRAFT INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION LIMITING HOURS OF WORK                         III COAL MINES.            Memorandum by the Secretary for Mines.     The meeting of Governments referred to in CP. 27 (33) washeld at Geneva on 20th February, and was first of all confronted with a request from the International Miners&apos; Federation that adeputation should be received to put before the meeting theviews of the Federation.   It appeared to me quite unnecessaryfor such a request to have been put before the meeting at all;and the suggestion made by Mr. H.B. Butler, Director of theInternational Labour Office, who presided, that the Deputationmight well be received, was still more unjustifiable.   Iopposed the suggestion, on the ground that it would be manifestlyimproper for a private meeting of government representatives toreceive a deputation from a section of the workers in theabsence of any representatives of the employers.   considerable discussion took place, and it was only after I stated that Iwould otherwise withdraw and seek instructions fromHis Majesty&apos;s Government that the meeting agreed not to receivethe deputation;  although I believe that the representatives ofthe other six countries did in fact see the deputationprivately during the day.   No representative of the Britishminers was with the deputation;  and my protest received amplejustification later, when the deputation handed in. a manifestocontaining an open threat of coercive action against any country that delayed the ratification of the Convention.     On the conclusion of this incident, the meeting xoroceededto hear statements as to the attitude of the governments represented towards simultaneous ratification of the Convention.     Readiness to ratify at any time, provided that all the seven countries would do so simultaneously, was expressed by france, HOLLAND, BELGIUM (after some hesitation), POLAND and czechoslovakia.                              -1-
     I made the same declaration as my predecessor made ayear ago, and GERMANY, while declaring themselves in favourof simultaneous ratification, considered that the questionof ratification could not profitably be discussed so longas its results are liable at any time to be called intoquestion by disturbances in the domain of currency and ofinternational movements of capital and goods.     The feeling of the meeting as a whole was that the last point was not of immediate importance, since it would necessarily take a considerable time to pass the necessary legislation in the different countries, and that discussion on other points should proceed.     It was necessary, therefore, for me to develop in more detail than had been done before the technical difficultiesencountered in Great Britain in regard to certain provisionsof the Convention as they stand.   I emphasised our two main difficulties, in regard to work at the week-end and continuousshift men, referring especially to the safety aspect of thesecond point and the opinion that this difficulty would not be confined to Great Britain.     The German Government admitted that they had not previously considered these points at all, but said that they now realised the difficulties and were prepared to support us.     In the course of the discussion which followed it became.apparent that certain other countries would also find difficulty in applying strictly the terms of the Convention.The remaining countries, however, led by the french representative, were obviously not prepared to support us in securing the modifications in the text which we desired.    Itseems probable that some, at any rate, of them were glad totake this tactical opportunity of postponing the ratification of the Convention which they had just expressed their willingness to accept.                               -2-
        They eventually agreed that the International Labour   Office should collect definite information as to the  position   in the different countries in regard to the two technical   difficulties mentioned, and they contemplated a further meeting   when this had been done.        A copy of the statement issued by the meeting is attached.   I should have liked it to include a reference to the  statement   made by the German Government as to the date of ratification,   but it was not possible to secure this and it was difficult   to attempt to do so, since the German representative  was the   only one supporting us on the question of modification.   Since my return from Geneva, however, the policy of the German   Government has been announced in the form of a declaration   published in the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (copy attached),   which I quoted on the 20th February in the House of Commons in   reply to a question on the subject of the Convention.    Germany   is now, therefore, a declared supporter of our view.                                           S.B.Mines Department,   3rd March, 1933.
COPY OP STATEMENT ISSUED BY THE MEETING.     The delegates of the Governments of Germany, Belgium,France, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Poland and czechoslovakia met on 20th February at Geneva to discuss thepossibility of simultaneous ratification and application atthe earliest possible moment of the Convention limiting hoursof work in coal mines.     They took note of the difficulties encountered by great Britain as regards the application of the Convention,particularly as regards the relief of men engaged on certainkinds of continuous work and as regards week-end work, andnoted that, in view of these difficulties, on which theywere unable to state an opinion, simultaneous ratification didnot appear possible at the moment.  They considered that afurther possible unofficial meeting could not usefully becontemplated until the International Labour Office hadcollected information as regards the manner in which thesetwo questions have in practice been settled in the countries concerned.
                                                         0 9    TRANSLATION OF AH BXTRACT FROM THE DSUTSCHS ALLGkSMiSINS              ZEITTJNQ of the 22nd February, 1933.                  Hours of &apos;^ork in Coal liinea.        The Text of the German Declaration at Geneva.     The Statement made on 20th February at Geneva on                                    -behalf of the German Government regarding the ratification of the Coal Mines Convention runs as follows:     &quot;It would be a source of satisfaction to the GermanGovernment if, by the simultaneous  ratification of theConvention concerning the limitation of hours of work in coal mines, the gaps between the prime costs of the mostimportant coal dealers could be narrowed even partly, andfor its own part the Government would be prepared to collaborate to this end.   Eut it can set no hopes on sucha course of action so long as its results are liable at anytime to be called into question by  disturbances in thedomain of currency and of international movements ofcapital and goods.   It therefore considers that the questionof ratification cannot profitably be discussed until thesedisturbances have been removed.&quot;
