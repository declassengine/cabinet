COPY 110.(3  kp.76(33) Educational, economies and the pay of new entrants to the                       Teaching Profession.          Memorandum fry the  President  of the Board of Education. 1.         I have recently had some discussion with the Chancellor       of tne Exchequer with rego.rd to the main recommendations of       the Ray Committee, in the course of v/hich he pressed two points       upon me;  first, a reduction in the number of -teachers       (mentioned &quot;by that Committee) ; and secondly?  that I should       refer to the Burnham Committee a proposal  (not so mentioned)       to reduce by five per cent, (over and ahove the present 10 per       centc) the pay  of teachers who enter the profession after       1st Apr-il 1934.   Estimates of the savings to he anticipated       under these two heads are given separately at the end of this       Memorandurn. 2.         My estimates for the current year show a reduction of        5,400,000 and  those for the coming year a further reduction       of  830,000, despite the automatic increase in the charge for       teachers&apos; pensions.            Notwithstanding the reductions already made I am       naturally anxious to give any further help I can.to lessen the       financial difficulties of the time, and I have accordingly       given careful consideration to the Cnancellor&apos;s two proposals       which, in my view, hang closely together. 3.         The present position in regard to teachers&apos; salaries is       that they are subject to the general 10 per cent, cut imposed       in September, 1931, as compared with the 20 per cent,       recommended by  the May Committee.            The Ray Committee did not propose any further       reduction of the minima or maxima of the scales, but                                19
suggested &quot;biennial increments in the earlier years of service.This recommendation we have rejected as inconsistent withour present policy of not imposing further cuts.     I do not propose to argue the merits or demerits ofthe general proposition of whether or not teachers areoverpaid.   The point to which i venture to think  it is moreprofitable to direct immediate attention is the consequencesthat might be expected to follow from raising the question ofnew entrants&apos; pay in present circumstances.     I feel reasonably satisfied that I can see my way togetting the reduction which the Chancellor desires of 4,500teachers in the course of the next three years, or evenperhaps to improve on those numbers, if I can approach thissubject without the general atmosphere being clouded by theintroduction of political opposition such as would be likelyto be aroused at this moment by the suggestion of reducingthe salaries of new entrants,     I am strongly of the opinion that our ability to make further savings depends largely upon the maintenance of conditions of reasonable good will amongst both LocalEducation Authorities and Teachers.   I am accordingly very doubtful as to the wisdom and expediency of proposing nowany further reduction of teachers&apos; salaries, even though thereduction is limited to new entrants and not properly, there-fore, to be regarded as inconsistent with our present policy.Any such suggestion would certainly arouse the bitter opposition of the teachers, both on general educational grounds and onthe ground that the action of the Government showed them nolonger -to be regarding the ten per cent, cut as a temporaryabatement to meet an emergency but as rightly applicable tothe whole range of teachers&apos; salaries for a period unspecified.V/e must also anticipate the opposition of many Local                            2.
Authorities, who, like the pay Committee,  will he averseto any further reduction in the minima or  maxima of the scales.   The political reactions on the general positionof the Government others can estimate as well as, or betterthan, I;  but apart from these considerations I amseriously concerned lest the ill-will thus aroused shouldseriously prejudice the smooth attainment  of the bigger  and earlier savings which could be secured from a steady reductionin the numbers of teachers.     On the other hand; if this matter were left to be dealtwith at seme future date when a final decision has beentaken about the cuts and when salaries generally were underreviev/, and as part of such review, the strength of theopposition would probably be diminished, and. in any case,  inthe meantime we should have got well on the way to secure our other economies in an untroubled atmosphere.     &quot;Were it, however, decided that in spite of what I have urged as to the inappropriateness of the moment, an inquiry should be instituted forthwith, certain further difficulties would arise of which my colleagues should  he aware.   ever since 1919 the question of teachers&apos; salaries has been dealtwith on the basis of collective bargaining by the burnham committee, consisting of a Panel of Teachers&apos; representatives,and a Panel of Local Authorities&apos; representatives, with  anindependent Chairman,   If we were to refer this particularaspect of the salaries question to them entirely out ofrelation to the question of salaries as a  whole, we should  at best get disagreement between the teachers and the Authorities,and at v/orst a united rejection of the proposal.   Ifalternatively the Burnham Commit tee were ignored and thematter referred to an ad hoc Committee, our action would be strongly resented by Local Authorities as  veil as by                            3c
Teachers as a fatal &quot;blow to the principles of collective bargaining, and we should, undoubtedly endanger for the future the whole prospect of securing national salary scales byagreement &quot;between Local Authorities and Teachers.     My immediate concern accordingly is not to argue the merits of reducing or not reducing teachers7 salaries, but rather to question the political and financial expediency of raising this very thorny problem at the present time.   Theimmediate savings from new entrants&apos; pay are admittedlyinconsiderable,  large though these may be at a comparativelyremote date.   My definite conclusion is that, politicaluncertainties &quot;being what they mast &quot;be, the prospect of anysubstantial saving from this source is not sufficient tocounterbalance the hostility which would certainly be eveked&quot;by this proposal made under existing conditions, with a consequent prejudice to the smooth attainment of the larger and more rapid saving from the reduction of teachers&apos; numbers.     I understand that the Chancellor of the Exchequer iscirculating a separate note, and I have accordingly limitedthis memorandum to a statement of my own views-                                 I.                              21st March 1933.4o
