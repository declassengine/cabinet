COPY NO.   j                 ARREST  OF METROPOLITAN-VTCKERS EMPLOYEES                         BY THE SOVIET GQVERiU\25iTT.                 -\ Q 7             MEMORANDUM BY  SIR R. VAITSITTART FOR THE CABINET.             The case  of the Hetropolitan-vickers employees in        Moscow  has now reached a position where it rests with the        Prosecutor of  the  Soviet Supreme Court to decide whether or        not  the evidence collected by the O.G.P.U. is sufficient        to justify a trial.  If  a trial is held, it is practically        certain to end in  a condemnation, with or without  serious        punishment of  the  accused, as no treason trial in  Soviet        history has yet  resulted in an acquittal, and the  Soviet        Government would probably find themselves too deeply com-        mitted  to permit of one.  In the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s        Ambassador at  Moscow, which is shared in the Foreign Office        a condemnation would create an impossible position both        for  British firms  trading in Russia and for His Majesty&apos;s        Government themselves in their relations with the  Soviet        Government - and one which, in any case, vrould not be        tolerated by public opinion in this country.             2. In these  circumstances Sir S. Ovey has been        authorised, on his own recommendation, to press the Com-        missar  for Foreign Affairs to agree to a settlement of the        case by which  the  Prosecutor shall declare that the evidence        is insufficient  for it to be procedded with, while His        Majesty&apos;s Government for their part will regard the incident        as closed by the immediate release of the prisoners and the        abandonment of the case  against all of them, on the under-        standing that  the  recurrence of any similar incident in        respect of any British subjects will be interpreted as a        clear  indication on the  part of the Soviet Government that        they attach no importance to the continuance of normal        friendly  relations with  His Majesty&apos;s Government.
     .3.-  M. Lltvlnoff, however, while not expressly re-jecting such a settlement, has hitherto given no lndica-tiori that it will be accepted, nor does it appear likely that this will be the case;  and, as it is now only amatter of a few days at the most before the Prosecutorgives his decision, Sir E. Ovey urges that all the meansof pressure at the disposal of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould be employed to secure a satisfactory settlementbefore it is too late*  He considers that if each of thesemeens of pressure is to exercise its maximum effect, theyshould be applied progressively in the following order     (1)  The Soviet Government should be informed that unless the prisoners are immediately released trade negotiertions will be suspended, with the result that on April17th the present commercial agreement will lapse, the diplomatic privileges now enjoyed by the Soviet traderepresentatives in London will be withdrawn and HisMajesty&apos;s Government will have the power to take any measures they think fit against Soviet imports into thiscountry.   ,  (2)  The Soviet G6v eminent should, at the same time4be informed verbally that if ho satisfactory answer regard-ing the release of the prisoners is forthcoming within ashort specified period, he himself will be recalled from moscow and the recall of the Soviet Ambassador in Londonwill also be requested, the respective Embassies being left in the hands of Charges d&apos;Affaires:     (3)  Should this action prove insufficient,  it shouldbe intimated that the continued imprisonment of theseBritish subjects or their condemnation in any form by theCourt will force His Majesty&apos;s Government definitely tosever all diplomatic- relations with the Soviet Government.                                    (4) ......
     (4)  The first of Sir E. Ovey&apos;s three proposed steps,indeed, has already been taken,  the statement made in theHouse of Commons on March 20th having made it plain thatthe trade negotiations would &quot;be suspended as long as thecase was not satisfactorily settled;  and though emphasiswas not then laid on the consequences of e lapse of thepresent commercial agreement these are both obvious andappreciated.  Sir E, Ovey has indeed been instructed tomake it clear to M. Litvinoff,  when informing him of theterms of the Statement, that further reference to thoseconsequences, such as the power of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto impose prohibitions on Soviet imports, was only omittedin view of the indications that the immediate release ofthe prisoners was still possible.     (5)  As regards the second step suggested by Sir E*Ovey, this in my opinion is going too far and too fast atthe present stagec  It would in any case be inadvisable toshow too iiiuch of our hand at once,  The step recommendedunder this heading would in any case be but a half measure,and produce embitterment but not effect.  I do nob excludeit in advance from all consideration in the event offurther provocation being offered to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment;  but I should personally hesitate to recommend it, atany rate without stronger ground and further consideration,,I doubt at present whether any penalty will be inflicted onthe prisoners, though  any verdjict would be adverse,  Whiletherefore giving weight to Sir E* Ovey&apos;s views - the more so in that he has hitherto been the apostle of moderationin dealings with the Soviet Government - I feel that HisMajesty&apos;s Government might lose the considerable creditwhich they appear to have gained hitherto from acting with both firmness and balance in this case by the premature                                        utterance  ......
utterance of explicit threats, as such action might indeedde!&apos;3at their avowed and avowable aim - to secure that the.prisoners are released unscathed - by making it more dif-difficult for the Soviet Government to withdraw from theirpresent position without too  complete a &quot;loss of face.&quot;      (6)   These considerations apply with even greaterforce to the third proposed step.  Sir E. Ovey has himselfpointed out that any breach of relations, likely to befollowed in a few years&apos; time by a second resumption of relations on the same terms, as has already occurred, wouldbe undesirable and undignified.  If, therefore, a breachwere to be decided upon, it would be understood that re-lations could not be resumed  unless and until the SovietGovernment had given satisfaction, which would not be likely for a long time to come.   Whether His Majesty&apos;s Gov-ernment decide that such an extreme and irrevocable stepmay ultimately become necessary or not must surely dependin the main on future developments, and for the reasonsalready given it seems premature, and indeed precipitate,to decide upon it now when these are still unknown, andwhen there are other means of pressure at hand which wouldseem both more effective and  less embarrassing- in theirpossible consequences.  If, for example, the Soviet Government were to be convinced  (by some action such as the in-troduction into Parliament of the necessary resolutiongiving power to prohibit any  class of Soviet imports intothis country after April 17th next,)  that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had the firm intention, not merely of allowing the trade agreement to lapse, but also of putting topractical use the power which they will then possess, itseems likely, judging from previous experience, that theeffect on them would be stronger than that produced even                                            ^......
by a threat to break off relations,  if they were not con-vineed that the breach would be followed by coixmercial rs-prisalSo  The question of the breach of diplomatic rela-tiOns does nob seem to me to arise as yet. in this matters the Soviet Government,, as is well known, are only able tomeet their present commitments in Germany and other coun^tries bj utilising the proceeds of their sales in thiscountry,  A threat to prevent such sales would thus bring them fe.ee to face with the ruin of their whole foreign trade system, which is based on credit, and of the FiveYear Plan itself, which depends on a constant supply ofimports of machinery, etc.;  and it seems hardly conceiveable that, even in their present state of hysteria, as SirE* Ovey has described it, they would be prepared to facesuch consequences rather than release a few foreigners. Ofcourse the actual execution of the threat would involveloss to British trade interests - which is why the SovietGovernment count on its not being carried out;  but a breach of diplomatic relations would also involve loss tosuch interests, since the Soviet Government would naturallydo their best to avoid trading with this country after thebreachc     (7)  In all the circumstances I think it best to standat present on cur present posltion0  The Soviet Governmentare under no illusions as to its present and eventual mean-ingP and it has, as Sir E. Gvey&apos;s telegrams show, alreadyproduced appreciable effect.  To go further at this stage would, in my opinion, show a tendency to rush our fences,and would cost us some of the general approbation withwhich our balanced firmness has hitherto been greeted, Ido not exclude the possibility of the eventual necessityof such steps as Sir E. Ovey now recommendSo  But I                                       submit........
                                                Sosubmit that the moment for the consideration of these measures is not new,     (8)  The foregoing was written on the basis of Sir E0Ovey&apos;s telegrams NoP 81 of 12th March and since then his telegram No0 90 of 21st March has been received,  I annexthese as appendices for convenience of reference,  I donot agree either that we should break off relations ifany trial is held, or that Sir E. Ovey should be brought home at this juncture whether for consultation or under anyother cover,,     (9)  What I venture to recommend is this:  that in theunlikely event of the&apos; prisoners being shot, we shouldbreak off all relations and of course bring Sir E. Oveyhome;  that in the more probable event of there being atrial,  and an adverse verdict followed by either release ora light sentence, we should declire to renew commercial negotiations, with all that such a decision implies thusdisposing of the allegation - vide Sir E, Ovey!s telegramNov.90 - that these things pass over after unnecessaryfuss;  that in the now still more unlikely event of theearly release of the prisoners we - having scored a victoryand/satisfactorily tested our means of pressure - shoulddrive an even harder commercial bargain than we shouldotherwise have attemptede  I venture to suggest that othercourses might not command general approval and that thisis .a matter of domestic as well as external politics,,  Ithink that a telegram should be sent to Sir E. Ovey a3soon as His Majesty&quot;s Government have reached a decision in this matteroFOREIGN OFFICE,     31st March.  1933e

If,  as seems likely, I  fail at  my final interview whichiionsieur Litvinov has now fixer! for  4.50  this afternoon, toobtain release of the prisoners, it  will  be  evident I shalllave exhausted every means I have  at my disposal pending yourfurther instructions.  Unless Kis  Majesty&apos;s  Government are toaccept a humiliating and impossible  situation, it follows thareal means of pressure must  be now exercised.  Half measurescan only result in a long drawn out  and unsatisfactory crisisI have always maintained that any  breach of  relations to befollowed perhaps in a few years by a second  resumption, wouldbe undesirable and even undignified; and that therefore theutmost patience must be exercised  to avoid such a situation arising from the point of view  of  the  potential value of anglo-Soviet trade.  This view  of  course presupposes that soviet Russia does not collapse in the interval. SituationIn this country has now reached the point where, unlessradical change of policy supervenes, this potential value isa rapidly diminishing quantity, and the patience of HisMajesty&apos;s Government has a. limit.     Following is a summary  of  my  further considered views as to the possible line of action:     (1)  A note  should be immediately addressed both here and in London to the: Soviet  Government to the effect that                                                     unless..o
     unless the prisoners ere released forthwith, trade     negotiations will be suspended with all that that implies,nometyafter April 16th absence of any agreement, lapse of     diplomatic privileges of Soviet trade representatives,     and the right of His Majesty1s Government to take any     suitable measures to deal with Soviet imports. (Soviet     Government will of course raise the cry &quot;as we have     always said, this was the plot all along&quot;).          (2)  That in making this written communication it     should be orally conveyed to Soviet Government here and     in London that should no satisfactory answer regarding     release of prisoners be forthcoming within a short     specified period, a further note will automatically follow     announcing the recall of the British Ambassador and     asking for the recall of the Soviet Ambassador, respective     affairs being left in hands of Charges  affaires.          (3)  Should these two notes be insufficient, it    . should be intimated that continued imprisonment or any     verdict inculpating them in any way (whether penalty  is     waived or not) or any act of arrest or molestation of air/     British subject whatever will  force His Majesty&apos;s Govern-     ment definitely to sever all diplomatic relations (which     would take place as soon as proper arrangements have  been     made for the evacuation of British subjects end departure     of prisoners from the country).  The  above  is  the best  1     can  suggest in order to secure the maximum possibility     against reprisals.  It  is,  it  seoms to me,  progressively     strong and  provides Soviet Government with two separate     opportunities  of yielding before the  threat of definite     rupture.

     As a final point, His Majesty!s Government will doubtless realise that reprisals against unfortunateRussian servants or other Russians in any way connectedwith this Embassy will probably be of a vindictivenature.     In making this proposal I need hardly assure youhow much I dislike suggesting the possibility of mydeparture at any rate before the end.  I make it infull sense of responsibility.     Three years however of the happiest collaborationentitles me to assure you that in such a case circum-stances could not have given His Majesty&apos;s Governmentadvantage of services of anyone whose character andtalents better qualify him for this delicate and res&quot;ponsible task than Mra Strang,

For all I know of course he&quot;may be discussing the question with Stalin0    Situationis, however, extremely disquieting.   Half measures haveapparently failed,,   2C   I understand Cabinet may meet tomorrow and I am glad to see  the general trend of Secretary of State5sviews so  early in the crinis as March 17th  (your telegramNo. 20),   30   Any  further representations on my part of avasrue kind will be immediately recognised by  Litvinov,who is no fool, as a mere repetition of  what  I havealready said and  as such would probably  do more harm than good.

His Majesty&apos;s Government now definitely to authorise me totell M, Litvinov without any beating about the bush (asimilar communication being made to Soviet Ambassador inLondon) that having taken this first step His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will net and cannot in the circumstances fail to go to the bitter end and break off relations rather.than suffer humiliating;, compromise of -permitting sfofrietS,to hold a trial of any kind whatevert i0 e,, that nopalliatives regarding conditions, bail, etc., can beconsidered as sufficient to avoid such contingency,,   40   Hallmark in my opinion of any compromise- onthis point would be that:-      (1) My position here would be untenable and that cfany subsequent British Ambassador intolerable (any subsequent transfer of myself elsewhere would be natural-ly regarded as failure of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentsstrong policy),      (2.) That Soviets having gained a strategic victory,(grp. uhdec) renounce position at any time - although they may pause to do so for a while - to restate &amp;similar trial at expense of ourselves or any other country, with the knowledge that such affairs, as theyopenly state here  &quot;always pass over in due course after a certain amount of unnecessary fuss on the part of theGovernment concerned&quot;.   Friendly diplomats are corwstantly assured that such is conviction of the SovietGovernment,   This is therefore still the mot d&apos;ordre0   5.
