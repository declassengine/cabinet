A r\ f193      PROHIBITION OP RUSSIAN IMPORTS:  POSSIBLE EFFECTS              UPON UNITED KINGDOM INTERESTS.     I._THE VALUE TO THE UNITED KINGDOM OF IMPORTS FROM                    1 HE SOVIET UNION.   1.  In 1932 the totel value of the imports from the soviet union was  19,697,000, a considerable decline from 1931 v/henthe total was  32,286,000.   Far the most importantcommodity is now soft wood, which in 1932 represented 6,015,000 or 31% of all imports from the Soviet Union.Softv/ood is one of the chief raw materials of United kingdom industry, consumption amounting to  40 million per annum,  ofwhich about 97$S is imported.   About 15  of the softwoodconsumed in this country is derived from the Soviet Union,and there is no doubt that its exclusion would cause a risein price which would affect not only the building trade butin a lesser degree most industries in this country.   Thegreat bulk of the imports of soft timber from the soviet union consist of sawn soft timber, and it is stated by thetrade that a number of grades of this material can only beobtained in satisfactory quality from the Soviet Union.   2.  Another import of particular importance from theSoviet Union is canned salmon.   This amounted in 1952 to 1,566,000 or 469? of imports of canned salmon from all sources.   A proportion, estimated at 70$, of imports of canned salmon from the Soviet Union would be more properlyregarded as Japanese, since the fishing rights in Kamchatkawhere most of the salmon comes from, were ceded to Japan afterthe Russo-Japanese war.    Means would have to be found bywhich the genuinely Russian article could be distinguished.If it were necessary to exclude all canned salmon consigned
from the Soviet Union,  a rise in the  price of this importantarticle of working class diet seems inevitable;  moreover,the Japanese Government might complain of discriminatoryaction affecting a trade in which their  nationals have important interests.   3.  Another very valuable trade to this country is thatin undressed furs.   The value of such furs  consigned fromthe Soviet Union in 1932 was  1,073,000.   The trade is anentrepot one, and the value of furs of Soviet originre-exported normally exceeds by considerable sums the valueof imports from the Soviet Union.  This is partly due tothe added value resulting from processes to which the fursare subjected here.   German interests are doing their best to capture this trade.    Similar considerations apply  on a smaller scale to the trade in bristles.   4.  Imports from the Soviet Union  of  flax and flax toware of importance to the coarse end of the linen indxistry,particularly in Scotland.   They might be replaced bysupplies from, e.g.,  other Baltic countries, but some rise of price might ensue which would affect  our competitive position.   5.  At the other end of the scale  come a number of commodities for which we do not depend on Soviet supplies.Examples are raw cotton ( 2,068,000 in 1931 but only 552,000 in 1932) wheat ( 6^ million  in  1931 but under 1 million in 1932) hydrocarbon oils  (over  2 million in1932), and butter (nearly  2 million  in  1931 and  1^ million in 1932) .   6.  Even where Soviet supplies of  any given  commodityare not  of national importance to this country  as  a whole,
they may still be of the greatest importance to particulartrading interests, and the losses which such interestsmay incur as a result of a stoppage of supplies may be considerable.   Contracts will become unprofitable tocarry out, or even impossible of fulfilment, and althoughit might be possible to give some statutory protection inthis respect, the protection would, to some extent, mean a mere transference of loss from one party to another ina chain of transactions.   There is one class of case inwhich heavy losses seem inevitable.   This is whereimporters have made advances to Soviet supplying organisa-tions against future imports.   In past years considerablesums have been advanced against imports of timber,  but forthe present season owing to the risks involved, difficulty was experienced in raising the money which,  so far as theDepartment is aware, has not been overcome.    It is known,however, that the Co-operative 7/wholesale Society have avery large sum outstanding which is variously estimated butbelieved to run into seven figures.   It is also known thatthe importers of furs have advanced some  225,000 against future imports.   In previous years,  a certain firm was inthe habit of advancing in January  50-60,000 against futurebutter imports.   It is not known whether they did so on thepresent occasion in view of the risks involved.   There maybe other similar cases of which the Department are unaware.The Soviet authorities would be likely to press for suchadvances wherever they could obtain them in  view of thetightness of their foreign exchange position.   If importsof the commodities in respect of which such advances havebeen mado are prohibited, the money must be given up forlost.   It would be possible to licence imports sufficientto repay the advances, but there is little chance that theSoviet authorities would consent to trade on such terms,since the exports would bring no benefit to them.                          -3-
Lv 6     II- VALUE Oi1 THE SOVIET MARKET TO UNITED KINGDOM TRADE.   7.  Goods purchased abroad &quot;by the Soviet Union have fallen in the main into two classes, (a)  iron and steel goods and machinery required for industrial development, and (b) rawmaterials and other primary products unobtainable within theirown borders.   8.  In the five years 1928-1932 the value of U.K.  produce and manufacturers exported to the Soviet Union has risen from 2,716,000 in 1928 to  9,275,000 in 1932.   Of the lattertotal machinery accounted for  6,025,000 and iron and steelgoods to  1,388,000.   These orders, coming as they have at atime when other trade in capital goods was at a standstillhave had even more Importance to the industries concernedthan the figures would indicate.   This is particularly thecase with the machine tool section.   Another industry whichwas pinning some hopes upon the commercial negotiations isthe herring fishery.   This industry has been experiencing avery trying time and their hopes have been raised by  certainpurchases made by the Soviet last year.   9. Re-exports on the other hand have fallen from  2,799,000in 1929 to .21,222,000 in 1932.   The Soviet buyers have shownan increasing tendency to purchase direct.   A proportion ofthe raw materials and primary products purchased by theSoviet  are  derived from Empire  sources but figures are not atpresent available which would show the effect on the Empireif the Soviet were  to lose,  through action on our part, animportant proportion of their purchasing power.   10.  It is probable that in the best conditions therewould have been  a falling  off of :3oviet  baying in 1933.   Theprogramme of  industrialisation  has been  slowed down.   Thetotal exports of the Soviet Union  in  1932  amounted  to no more
than enough to meet their maturities in 1933,  so that  theywould in any case have &quot;bought with great caution and pressed for long credit which other countries might have been  morewilling than we to accord.   Nevertheless,  if  drastic  action is taken against tne Soviet, criticism is likely to assume that the 1932 level of trade would otherwise have been maintained.   11. The special problem raised by goods in  course ofmanufacture to Soviet order (about  1 million)  is dealt within the section on Financial xiffects.        III.  SffpaCT ON EXPORT TRAjpa TO other COUNTRIES.   12. Curtailment of Soviet export trade to the UnitedKingdom may also be expected to have another effect, whichshould be mentioned.   In certain Eastern countries, notably the Persian Gulf, Turkey, Persia, the Dutch East Indies andNorthern China, Russian manufactured goods have been beginning to appear as competitors of those of British origin.   Ifdrastic action is taken against the Soviet, they are likelyto endeavour to extend and intensify this competition, cuttingprices in order to harm our trade as much as they can.   Howfar they will succeed is questionable.   The goods we  have to fear can only be made in Russia on expensive machinery thewhole or parts of which need to be imported.   If Sovietcredit is destroyed by the exclusion of Soviet exports fromthe United Kingdom market, they will be unable to obtain themachinery necessary to enable them to maintain, even at itspresent level, the efficiency of their industrial output,.If this occurs, they will in time be unable to compete as strongly as they do now.
               IV. EFFECT OH BRITISH SHIPPING.   13.  The effeot that a prohibition of imports, exoeptunder licence, would have on British shipping dependspartly on the extent to whioh licences would, in fact, begranted, partly on the extent to which the Soviet mightretaliate by declining to use British ships for oarrylngtheir exports to other countries, and partly on the extentto whioh it would be possible to make it a condition of granting licences that the goods imported must be oarried inBritish ships.   14.  Official  statistics as to the use made by the Soviet of British ships generally are not availabler,  an examination of the entrances of vessels in United kingdom ports with cargoes from the Soviet in 123 2 shows that outof a total of 1,878,000 net tons, 391,000 tons were Britishand 241,000. tons were Russian.   15*  From information furnished by the Chamber of Shipping,whioh admittedly may not be comprehensive, It appears thatof the total number of voyages of British ships employed incarrying Soviet exports, 54$ are in respeot of trade fromthe Soviet to other than United Kingdom port a e   TheOhamber of Shipping has estimated that 45$ of the freightearnings (less expenses abroad) by British ships in soviet trade is in respeot of such voyages.  They estimate thatthe total earnings of British ships in Soviet trade in 1932were  956,000, or  619,000 excluding expenses abroado   16.  While there are so-many uncertain factors it isImpossible to indicate what effect the proposal would havegenerally on British shipping.  On the assumption that tothe extent to whioh Soviet Imports were prohibited theoommoditle3 must be replaced by imports from other oountries.,p.g. grain from the Argentine and Canada,  timber from
   Soandinavia and Canada, oil from America or Persia and that   the Soviet took no retaliatory action against British   shipping it is probable that British shipping on balance   would gain, although individual British shipping companies   would suffer severelye   Such a gain, however, would be   offset if the Soviet retaliated by refusing to continue to   employ British shipping to oarry their exports from the   Soviet to other than United Kingdom portoe                       V* FINANCIAL EFFECTSuA * 9JL Russia^ ability and re ad in e ss t o^ P a *      17* An embargo on imports into the United Kingdom from   Russia would have serious financial consequences,  both   direct and indirect, to British interestso  In 1932 this   country took ^ne-quarter of Russia&apos;s total exports;  in   1950 and 1931 we took one-third*  Moreover, it is estimated   that the proceeds of the Soviet&apos;s exports to all countries   In 1933 (excluding gold, which is an uncertain quantity)   will, if they are maintained at the 1952 level, be no more   than enough to meet the outstanding obligations which   mature during the present year*  Deprived of this market it   seems impossible therefore for the Soviet Government to   avoid default except in the most unlikely event of their   being able to increase substantially their sales elsewhere0      18*  If the Soviet Government could reasonably ascribe   their default to the action of H*Mo Government they might   be greatly tempted to confine their default as far as   possible to their British obligations (and especially those   whioh are guaranteed by HcM. Government)o   On Credits guaranteed by hon* Government *      19. Russian oredits guaranteed by the Export Credits   Guarantee Department are as follows:-
Rills outstanding in respect of goods already shippedO : C T 6 O oPace Value. 9,000,000RLlls which the Department is under contract to guarcujtee on delivery of goods not yet ready for shipment900,000  Amount&apos;g.c-.^j ar Lee do6,200,000600,000        VJhilst in oertain circumstances the Department ;?ould he   under no legal, liability in respect of goods not yet shipped,   it is felt that manufacturer3 would be able to establish a   strong moral claim against the Government if, as the result   of action take.; by the Governmenty they were deprived of the   Departments guarantees upon which they would otherwise have   had good reason to rely.  Host of these undelivered goods   have been specially manufactured for the Russian market and   are unsaleable elsewhere .   The total loss to the United   Kingdom in respect of guaranteed credits would therefore be   almost  10,000,000 of which the Government share would be   about  7,000,000.0* On other credits granted by British firmac      20* But, in addition to these guaranteed credits, the   Soviet Government have obtained oredits from manufaoturers   who have not had recourse to the Export Credits Guarantee   Department and from importers who have made advances against   future shipments of Russian produce.  It is difficult to   estimate what the total of these un-guaranteed credits ia,   but it seems likely to be in the neighbourhood of  5,000,000,        thus the total direct loss to the United Kingdom   might amount to  15,000,000.D. on Germany.      21.  Considerable indirect loss would also be   sustained through the probable Inability of the Soviet   Government to meet its maturing obligations in Gerrnanyo
These are understood to amount to RM,1,250 million of whichRM.700 million mature during 1933.   Russia cannot meet these obligations from the produce of exports to Germany.   In 1932Germany took from Russia imports to the value of RM.475 million of which more than RM.200 million consisted of gold.    as there is no reliable information about Russia&apos;s gold outputit must remain uncertain whether she can maintain gold exportsto Germany at this level.   Having no important favourable balance of trade with any other country, Russia must thereforedepend mainly upon the proceeds of her sales in the UnitedKingdom to meet her obligations in Germany,   If Germany- isdeprived of the payments due from Russia she will, in turn,be provided with excuses, if not valid reasons; for furtherdefault to her creditors.Board of Trade,   27th March, 1933.
