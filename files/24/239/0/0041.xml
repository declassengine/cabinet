COPY ;To.   .....CP,91 (333,             BATTERSSA POWER STATION.               Memorandum by The Minister of Transport.             I desire to bring to the notice of the Cabinet certain   proposals in connection with the new Power Station at Dattersea,             In February j 1927, the London Power Company made   application to tho Electricity Commissioners for consent to the   establishment of a generating station of an ultimate  capacity of   360,000 k0w,  on a site at Battersea.   The Commissioners held a   public  Inquiry into the application and the representations and   objections lodged in connection therewith.             After consultation with the Office of Works (whose   separate approval was required by and given to the Company under   the London Electric Supply Act of 190G), the Commissioners issued   their consent to the establishment of the station and the immediate   erection of the first section co contain Initially 120,000 k.w.  of   generating plant with the necessary boilers, etc. subject tc the   conditions (i)  that the Company should in the construction and use   of  the  station take the best  known precautions for the due   consumption of smoke and  for  preventing as far as reasonably   practicable the evolution of  oxides of sulphur and for preventing   any nuisance  arising from the station or from any operations   thereat;   and (ii)  that the plans and drawings of the station   should be submitted for approvals             In  November,  1921&apos;,  the Commissioners gave their approval   to  plans  involving  the  installation of two 60,000 k.\v0  turbo   alternator sets and two batteries of  threo boilers each,  the normal
evaporative capacity of each boiler being 250,000 lbs.  per hourwith a maximum rating of about 312,000 lbs.  per hour.          Following the issue of the consent, various  bodiesraised the question of the possible effect of  thio  station on public amenities and health and the matter formed the  subjectof a number of questions in Parliament as the  result of which lord Londonderry gave an undertaking in April,  1929, to theeffect that the question of further extension  (i.e.  beyond thefirst section of 120,000 k.w. up to the ultimate capacity of360,000 k.w.) would come within the purview of Parliament andthat if objections were brought forward by reason of the fact  thatthe first section was not satisfactory, as it was believed itwould be, Parliament would have the opportunity of expressing  itsopinions as to whether the station should be further extended.          It was arranged that this undertaking should be implemented by consultation between the Minister of Transport  andthe First Commissioner of Works so that steps  could be takentodraw the attention of both Houses to the matter.          At the same time, the then Minister  of Transportinstructed the Commissioners to ask the Government  Chemist inconjunction with the technical representatives  of other Departmentto investigate and report on the measures proposed  to  be adoptedby the London power Company at Eattersea with  the view ofobviating the emission of oxides of sulphur.   An interim reportby the Company&apos;s technical advisers and a report by  the committee presided over by the Government Chemist on the  results of an experimental plant at the Grove Road Powor Station  of  the power company was presented to Parliament in November, 1929,  and anundertaking given to the effect that the full scheme (i.e.  thefurther 240,000 k.w. contemplated at the station) would not be
sanctioned until the Committee presided over &quot;by the GovernmentChemist had made their further report and it was clear that adequate measures could and would be taken to avoid danger whichnight result from the emission of sulphur fumes.          The Second Report of the Committee presided over &quot;by theGovernment Chemist was presented to Parliament in November, 1930,after reference to the Cabinet0   In a prefatory note it was stated that in authorising the publication of the report, theMinister of Transport had ascertained from the Committee thatthey were satisfied from the experiments made at Grove Soad thatit was practicable to instal in connection with the first sectionof the Battersea Station a plant which would reduce the emissionof sulphur fumes to a negligible quantity0          The South East England Electricity Scheme adopted by theCentral Electricity Board in February, 1928, provided that the newBattersea Station, having an initial installation of 120,000 koW.and designed for an ultimate capacity of 360,000 k.w. should be a selected station for the purpose of that Scheme.          In October, 1932, the Electricity Commissioners received an application from the Power Company for consent to instal anadditional generator set of 100,000 k.w. (&quot;but no additional boilerplant)8   The Central Electricity Board consider that the Company&apos;proposal would result in economies and asked the Commissioners to approve of a direction being given by the Board to the Company inpursuance of Section 5  of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1926, toproceed with tho installation of the additional generator.          At the beginning of January, 1933, the ElectricityCommissioners communicated with the Ministry of Transport and alsowrote to the Office of Works and the Ministry of Health notifyingthem of the proposal and pointing out that the additional set was
 to be utilised in conjunction with the existing sets for standby purposes;  that no extension of boiler plant or buildings was involved in the application;  and that the additional set would enable the operations at Bow and Grove Road Generating Stations to be considerably restricted.          The Commissioners subsequently informed me that they proposed to attach to.their conoents if and when givens a condition limiting the amount of user of the Station when the new set was installed to the same maximum load conditions as would have been possible with the two existing sets alone, and limiting the output in any one year to 7205000,000 units.   This figure compares with an output of 786,000,000 units which is possible under existing consents and.was contemplated would be obtained from the existing plant in pursuance of the proposals of the &quot;Grid&quot; Scheme for South East England.          Representations against the proposals of the London Power Company were made by certain Local Authorities and other bodies; and on 27th February, the Commissioners at the request of the London County Council met a deputation of representatives of the London County Council and of the Councils of the City of Westminster, the Royal Borough of Kensington and the Borough of Chelseao          After learning from the Commissioners the conditions tobe attached to the consent to the new set the London County Council has resolved &quot;that no objection be offered to the application of the London Power Company, Limited&quot;.   The Y/westminster City Council and the Kensington Borough Council have also intimated that they do not propose to raise objection5 but the Chelsea Borough Council have not yet done soo          An inspection of the gas washing plant installed at the Battersea Station has been made by the Government Chemist and the technical experts associated with him who reported on the 23rd
3rd April,, 1933,February &quot;that the Committee were impressed with the magnitude ofthis elimination plant as indeed they were with the whole station5and they see no reason to believe that this extrapolation of themethod employed in Grove Road, with the subsequent improvementsgained by later experience there, should not provo satisfactory forsecuring the reduction of sulphur fumes emitted to a negligiblequantity especially as the design is capable of utilisingvariations in process without alteration to the plant&quot;.          The Commissioners are satisfied that by the installation of the additional set at Battersea under the conditions proposed,there will be a substantial reduction in coal consumption at GroveRoad and Bow Generating Stations of the Power Company, and that owing to the higher efficiency of the new set the coal consumption at the Battersea Station itself will be substantially less than theamount which would have been consumed in producing the same output from the existing plant.          In these circumstances I consider that no objection need be taken to the issue of the necessary consent,,   The Minister of Health and the First Commissioner of Works concur.          In view however of the pledge given by Lord Londonderryit will be necessary to make a statement in the House of Lords andI desire to be authorised to arrange for this at an early date.          An early decision of the Cabinet is desired as the workon the additional set, if approved, can be started immediately0It will involve an expenditure of  875,000 and will provide about one year&apos;s work for 1,400 men.
