THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1933.SECRET.                                                Copy No.  0 *CP.  54 (33).CABINET.JAPANESE COMPETITION  IX  THE  TEXTILE TRADE.            Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    THE problem of Japanese competition is becoming  increasingly serious inthe home market, in Colonial markets and in India.  The articles most seriously affected are cotton piece  goods, silk and artificial silk, but there is also seriouscompetition in certain other articles, such as cement and rubber shoes.    2.  Japanese competition stands in a class by itself.   In the first place, theprices at which Japanese goods are sold are so low that a tariff  rate, reasonable and effective against other foreign countries, is wholly ineffective against Japan.Secondly,  while  Japan increases  her sales in Empire markets, her purchases.always small, are growing smaller, and are likely to be still further reduced as shedevelops Manchuria as a source of supply.    3.  Our commercial relations with Japan are governed by the Anglo-JapaneseTreaty, which is binding on Great  Britain and  on the great majority  of theColonies.   This  Treaty contains the usual most-favoured-nation clause,  and isdenounceable on  a year&apos;s  notice.    4.  I am therefore of opinion that we must deal with Japanese competition and deal with it in isolation.  My proposal is that the Japanese  ambassador should be informed that the  pressure of public opinion  in this country will makeit  necessary for  us  to safeguard our markets  here and in  the Colonies against japanese competition, and that unless  an agreement can be  reached as to thescale of imports, we shall be  bound to denounce the Treaty, thus leaving ourselvesfree here and in the Colonies to impose any duties against JajJanese goods.  Atthe same time, I should  propose  as  an alternative an agreement by which theimports of Japanese goods into the  United Kingdom  and  the various Colonialmarkets would be limited to an agreed quota.  It would not be enough to takethe present figure,  for in many  cases the market has been  already captured.The only basis of agreement which would be  acceptable to  Britain would be a quota based on the average  relative imports of Japan and  this country  over aperiod of years, say, five years.  The agreement would  provide that goods upto  the amount of the quota for each class should be admitted at the same rate of duty as is  applicable to  other foreign goods, but that once the  quota had beenreached, further importations would be prevented, either by a prohibition or by aprohibitive duty.    5.  If an agreement could be reached on these lines it would  obviously bebetter  than denouncing  the Treaty.  First,  the  delay  of a full  year  beforedenouncing would be avoided.  Secondly,  it would be easier to get  the colonies to  give effect to  an agreement than to impose  the whole series of new and highduties against Japan.  Thirdly, it would encourage the Japanese to raise their prices, since if they knew they could only sell a limited  amount in  any market.they would wish  to get the best possible price for that limited amount.    6.  A quota system of this kind would want carefully working  out for eachmarket, and would require a detailed arrangement covering the  different  classesof  goods in each market. I am advised,  however, by  the Manchester  Chamber       [8307]
of Commerce, that they think a comparatively simple schedule could be devised,market by market, which could be operated not only by  the  Customs in thiscountry, but by the much more primitive administrations in the Colonies.    7.  I do not see how anything short of the action proposed  will effectivelysafeguard  the  home  and   Colonial  market  against  Japanese  competition.Moreover, I believe that if action on these lines were taken by this country, itwould be a great encouragement to India and to the Dominions to  treat japanese competition in the same way.  I have already outlined this scheme confidentiallyto the Governors of all African and West Indian Colonies  and to the governors of Ceylon and Malaya, and expressed the hope that, if  it is decided  to act onthese lines, the various Colonies will co-operate!  The text  of my letter is reproduced in the Appendix.    8.  I ought to add that 1 think it may be difficult to  press the Colonies toimpose higher duties  against Japan  than this country  is imposing for theprotection of its own manufactures.  And we must frankly face the fact that tobe effective against Japan duties must be on a very high scale.                                                 (Initialled)      P. C.-L.Downing Street.

APPENDIX.Private and Personal.                                   January 24. 19:33.*    &quot;* As you know, the rapid inroad of Japanese competition in Colonial marketsis causing great, alarm in the textile industries in this country.   The President oft lie Board of Trade and  1 have had a number of talks with representatives of the textile industries;  and  the Manchester Chamber  of  Commerce has  a specialCommittee working on  the subject in close contact with us.    The position is undoubtedly very serious, and competition in cotton and artificial  silk goods is increasing in the most formidable way in East and West Africa and in the west indies.    &quot; Industrially,  the position is  very serious, and politically there is already astrong demand for action, and this demand will grow.   I have been in Lancashiremyself, and  I have never seen the trade  so genuinely alarmed.    &quot; We can meet  competition from other countries with a moderate preference,where preference can be and is granted : and where treaties at present debar thegrant of preferences, the situation, vis-a-vis countries other than Japan, is such that the relative advantages and disadvantages of denouncing  treaties and con-ventions can be carefully weighed.  But Japanese competition is in a class by itself.    The prices are such  that no duty which is  adequate  against  othercountries  has the least  effect.   Moreover, while  other countries are buyers of colonial produce on a considerable scale. Japan buys little; and with clevelop-ments in Manuchuria will probably buy even less in the future.    &quot;We have therefore to face the  Japanese position by itself as an entirely separate problem.   We are at present bound by the Anglo-Japanese commercial treaty, which is binding on  practically all  Colonies as  well  as on this country.If that treaty were denounced either comprehensively or in respect of particularColonies, we should then be free to impose any duties on Japan, leaving the duties on other countries  as they are.   I appreciate that in East Africa, even if theJapanese  Treaty  were denounced. Japan could  still rely on the Saint-GermainTreaty, and this would require  special consideration.    &quot; The question whether the  Japanese  Treaty should be  denounced  raisesgrave questions of  general policy which will be  considered by the Governmenthere in all their aspects.  But the line which the President of the Board of Tradeand I have&apos; been considering and discussing confidentially with Manchester is asfollows :  The Foreign Secretary, the  President of the  Board  of Trade and Ishould see the Japanese Ambassador  and tell him frankly  that the position was such that some  effective  action would have to be taken; public opinion would not tolerate the loss of  British markets to British trade;   that the  continued  loss ofThe Governor of   Kenya.  Uganda.The British Resident  at Zanzibar.The Governor of   Nyasaland.  Northern Rhodesia.  Somaliland.  Nigeria.  The Gold Coast.  Sierra Leone.  The Gambia.  The Governor of-    Trinidad.    Barbados.    The Leeward Islands.    The Windward Islands.    Jamaica.    British  Guiana.    British  Honduras.    The Bahamas.    Bermuda.

these markets would inevitably lead to an irresistible demand for the deuuncia-tion of the Treaty; indeed, this demand was already clamant.  We should thensuggest that the only way of avoiding the immediate denunciation of the treaty would be for  Japan to agree that she should  limit her exports to each  of  theColonial markets to a given  figure or quota.  Such quota would  he based on anaverage over a number of years.   Up to  the agreed quota Japan could  continueto import into each market at the same rate of duty as was imposed  on other foreign imports.  If, however, the  quota were exceeded, then any excess would hesubject to a prohibitive duty.  The Manchester Chamber Committee tell me thatthey could work out a schedule of the different classes of textile goods in eachmarket which would be practical and which could be easily administered.     &quot; I  have made it plain to the Manchester Committee that there may be certain classes of goods for which  a market only exists in a Colony by reason oftheir extreme  cheapness, and that we might  have to make some special exemptionand put  no quota upon  these limited classes of goods. But there is no question that, broad and  large, Japan is  now  scooping the whole  market which  was previously enjoyed by this country.     &quot; I think it is  very likely that we shall decide in the Government here thatwe are bound  to proceed on these lines.  If we are convinced that action on theselines is necessaiy, I am sure your Government would  be ready to reciprocate.  Itis of vital importance to  the Colonial Empire that the  preferences which theyenjoy under the new policy should  be made firmly secure and should, if necessary.be extended.   If the situation develops, as 1 anticipate it will, the i&apos;eadiness ofthe Colonies  to help England  to  keep a fair share  of the Colonial market asagainst Japan will be regarded here  as the acid  test of the value of mutualpreference.     &quot; I  do not, of course, wish you at  this moment to take any action, but i thought it very desirable that I should write and give you an appreciation of  thesituation which is developing here and of the results which  I think are likely tofollow, and to put frankly to you the whole position as I see it.  I am writing inthe same sense to all Governors in East and West Africa, and the West Indies.though where I have  had opportunities of personal discussion, this  letter is largely a repetition of the lines we have discussed/&apos;                                   (Signed)       P.
