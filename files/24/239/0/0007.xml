A number of vague allegations of corrupt practices  on  the partof members of the Glasgow Tow n G council i.l were rEeeived in  5.929  andoarly in 1930, and were investigated at that  time  by the CriminalsAuthorities who decided that there was no  sufficient evidence tojustify criminal proceedings.   About the  same  time  reprosenta-tions were also made urging that the alifcgatians shtmld  be  madfethe subject of an inquiry under the tribunals ef InquirylEvidenctaJ Actr 1921.   This Act provides  for the  appointment ofa tribunal either by His Majesty or by a Secretary of State&quot;where it has been resolved -----  by both  Rouses of  parliament that it is expedient that a tribunal be established  for  inquiringinto a definite matter described in  the Resolution as  of urgentpublic importance&quot;, it was decided,, however,,  that  the chargae ofcorruption ware of too vague and generalised  a  character to justifyrecourse to the provisions of the  Acte and the  Government5sdecision was announced in the House  of Commons  in  reply  to  aC A B X. M S 1&apos;,Parliamentary/COPY JbiO,
Par! lament a   question on the 2nd July p  i,9&apos;SO,Since then, there has been a fundamental change in thesituation.   On the 20th ultimo two Glasgow Town Councillors *-Bailie ,Tames Strain and Bailie Alexander Ritchie - appeared bsfbrethe High Court of Justiciary at Glasgow on a charge of anoffense under the Public Bodies Corrupt Practices Aet, 1889*strain, who was Convener of the Town Counoil Committeeresponsible for dealing with the allocation of market stances,pled guilty to corruptly soliciting money as an inducement to or reward for his aid in connection with the allocation of market stances and was fined  50 and declared incapable of holding public office for 3 years.  Ritchie pled &apos;not guilty&apos;and the oroceedinr*s against him were abandoned on the groundthat the evidence available was probably insufficient tosecure a conviction;   ^hs oas* h.&amp;8 aroused great publicinterest, and has been made the occasion for the renewal of representations in favour of a searching investigation intothe conduct of municipal affaire.    The representations haveculminated in the receipt of an unanimous Resolution passed bythe Corporation of Glasgow on the 2nd instant ksking me totake steps to have a Tribunal appointed under the 1V21 Actto inquire into oertain statements alleged to have bean mads?by Strain about the Markets Committee of the Town Counciland also into various matters connected with the businessof the Corporation,   I am also being pressed to take thiscourse by Members of the House of Commonb.     After very careful consideration of all the circumstances in consultation with the Lord Advocate I have reached theconclusion that there is now sufficiently definite subject matter of urgent public importance to justify the appoint-merit of a Tribunal, whose duty it would be to inquire intoallegations/(s)
all sections of bribery and corruption in  connection withthe Corporation&apos; n transaction of its business,  am) I Shellbe [jfiaA to have authority to announce,  in reply to a parliamentary questi on, that steps are  tc be taken toappoint s Tribunal,   As indicated in paragraph. P. above,f-. Resolution win be necessary, in terms  of the Aot.in both Houses of parliament,                    (Id,?  G.P.C.Scottish Office,    Whitehall , :8.VM.6 th March, 1933,
