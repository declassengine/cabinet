SECOND  REPORT.                           INTRODUCTORY.    IN our first report (Council paper E.A.C. (H.) 153), we surveyed the major problems likely to arise at the World Monetary and Economic Conference, and indicated our views as to the policy which His Majesty&apos;s Government should pursue.  Since this report was completed  in October, two meetings of  thePreparatory Commission  of  Experts have been held  at  Geneva, and a  draftannotated agenda, representing the report of the Commission, has been prepared.We have studied this report, and we have been enabled by the Chancellor of theExchequer to see the report prepared by the British representatives (Sir frederick leith-Pioss and Sir Frederick Phillips) on the meetings of the Commission.  Weare also indebted  to the Chancellor of the  Exchequer for  permitting us to see memorandum containing the observations of the Treasury on certain proposals put forward in our first report.    2.   We do not propose to cover again the range  of topics  which we dealtwith in our previous report.  Upon two questions, however, upon which we thenlaid special emphasis we desire to add some supplementary observations, in thelight of subsequent developments and the comments made on our proposals.  we also attach to our report a brief supplementary note on certain aspects of shippingpolicy.[8397]
              THE  MOST-FAYOURED-NATION  CLAUSE.     3.  We  foreshadowed  in  our first  report  that  certain countries would  belikely  to press for a modification of  the  most-favoured-nation  clause, so as tofacilitate the conclusion of regional tariff arrangements; and we urged  that itwould  be unwise for His Majesty&apos;s Government to adopt an obstructive attitudeupon this matter.  We expressed the belief that it is probably only by the methodof multilateral  concession  based  on  the principle of reciprocity that effectiveprogress can be made towards a reduction  of tariff barriers; and we argued that progress along these lines is likely to be impeded by the operation of the most-tavoured-nation clause in its present form.  We were also influenced  by the fear that &quot;the practical alternative to a reinterpretation of the most-favoured-nation clause  will  be.  first, an increasing evasion  of it,  and ultimately  its  generalabrogation,&quot; leading to &quot; a  chaotic period  of complicated discriminatory systems and  tariff retaliations.&quot;  We suggested accordingly that the British  Governmentshould indicate its readiness to consider the question of reinterpreting the most-favoured-nation clause, so as to facilitate collective low-tariff agreements, providedthat these did not assume an exclusive character.     4.   The question of the  most-favoured-nation clause  received considerable attention at the proceedings of the Preparatory  Commission. The report declares that &quot;  in normal conditions, the unconditional and unrestricted most-favoured-nation  clause should form  the basis  of commercial  relations  between nations.&quot;and  proceeds to &quot; recommend that the conference should reach an agreement atany rate as to the scope of the most-favoured-nation clause, if not as to its precise form.&quot;  It states that &quot; a suggestion which has been  strongly pressed in variousquarters is that States should admit  an exception to the  most-favoured-nation clause whereby advantages derived from plurilateral agreements should be limitedto the contracting States and to such  States as may voluntarily grant equivalentadvantages.&quot;  It urges that this proposal &quot; should certainly  be most carefullystudied,&quot; and. after setting out impartially its advantages and its disadvantagesor dangers, it enumerates the following as indispensable conditions:         &quot; In any case,  these exceptions must be subject  to the  conditions that    agreements of this kind be open to the adhesion  of  all interested States and    that their aim should be in harmony with the general interest. Amongst the    conditions that might be considered for this purpose, mention may be made    of  a  proviso  that  these  agreements shall  have been  concluded under  the    auspices of the League of Nations or  of organisations  dependent&apos; on  the    League.    Further,  these  agreements must not  involve new hindrances to    international  trade  vis-a-vis  countries having most-favoured-nation  rights.    Finally,  &apos; collective  agreements&apos;  can  only  be  regarded as  such  when  they    comply  with certain conditions, to  be determined,  as to the number of the    participating States.&quot;The report then proceeds to discuss in a similar spirit the question of temporaryexceptions to facilitate such  special  agreements  as those designed to  give a preference to the cereal exports of the Danubian countries.    5.   The definition of the conditions with which  collective agreements mustcomply, if they are to  be  admitted  as exceptions to the  most-favoured-nation clause, is in our judgment excellent; and the arguments  in favour of and againstcollective agreements are fairly marshalled in the report.  It is evident, however,that there are at present great differences of opinion between  different countriesboth as to the desirability of collective agreements,  and, still  more, as to the expediency of facilitating them by a relaxation of most-favoured-nation  rights.These  differences may be expected to  reassert themselves at the conference itself,and  it is  clear that it  will not be an  easy  matter to do what  the PreparatoryCommission  urge and &quot;find a solution for the whole of this question which willreconcile the interests of all.&quot;     6.  Great, however, as  are the difficulties presented  by this question, its wisehandling  will prove, we believe, of crucial importance for the  future of inter-national commercial relations.   The  precise  line which it will  be best for theBritish Government to  take  must necessarily  be  affected by the movement of
opinion and the development of policy in other countries; and for this and other reasons there has been much to be said for maintaining up to the present a non-committal attitude, such as we gather was adopted by the British representatives at the Preparatory Commission.    At the conference, however, it will probablyprove essential for the British Government to assume a more definite position;and much may depend upon whether we throw our influence in the scales on theone side or the other.   We regard it, therefore, as vital that our attitude upon thequestions of the most-favoured-nation clause and collective agreements should be-carefully thought out in the meantime.     7.  We adhere to our opinion that this attitude should  be one of sympathyto the  idea of  an exception to  the most-favoured-nation  clause in  favour of collective low-tariff agreements.   We are not unmindful of the important part which the most-favoured-nation clause plays in our existing  commercial treaties,and of the valuable safeguards which it provides against a chaotic  regime ofdiscriminator tariffs.    On the  contrary, we  regard it as  a vital  objective of world statesmanship to preserve the essentials of the clause.   But we believe thata, stage  has been  reached at which  these essentials can only be preserved bymodifying their application.  For this reason criticism which takes the form ofdwelling on the advantages of the most-favoured-nation clause or  on the dangers which would  follow its abrogation, seems to us  to miss the mark.  We arguedat some length in  our previous report that it was unlikely that European states would continue to  acquiesce indefinitely in an interpretation of the most-favoured-nation  clause which permits the  British Empire to develop  a  comprehensive system  of  Imperial  Preference while precluding other countries from  entering into regional  agreements.   We  think  it  desirable,  however, to convey more precisely than we  attempted to do in our previous report how great is the clangerof international tariff  anarchy if the existing tendencies develop unchecked.     8.   The Preparatory Commission enumerated the following four methods byAvhich reductions of tariffs might be effected :     (a) a general  agreement of the conference;     (6) a collective agreement of a group of governments;     (c) bilateral negotiations;     (d)  autonomous action on the  part of governments individually.While  nothing  could  be more welcome than  an agreement of  the  conferenceproviding  for the  simultaneous reduction of tariff barriers throughout the world,it can hardly be expected that any concrete agreement of this character can bereached, in view of the diverse economic conditions and tariff systems of different countries.  Indeed,  if any attempt were made to define a general standard  fortariffs that would be universally accepted, it would be so far  from  securing  the degree of freedom of trade that is needed that it might easily become a hindrancerather  than  a help.   The  most, therefore, that  can  reasonably  be  hoped for  under heading  (a)  is  the  assertion of  general aims  and  principles which  will  leave  the practical  work  of  tariff  reduction  to be  achieved by   one of the three other  methods.   In some  degree   it  is possible  that effect  might  be given to general conference resolutions by action  along  thelines of  method  (d),   i.e.,  by autonomous action  on  the  part of  individualgovernments.   The most  obvious possibility under this heading is opened up bythe change of  government  in the United States,  as the  result of which an administration  favourable in principle  to tariff  reduction is now  in power.Apart, however,  from the  special case  of  the United  States, the prospects of reducing tariffs by autonomous action are not encouraging.  Governments havenot hesitated to take autonomous action with regard to tariffs in recent years, butit has been, with scarcely  an exception, in the direction of higher tariffs.  general conference resolutions might exercise a restraining influence upon this tendency,but it is difficult  to suppose that they would suffice  by  themselves,  and withoutany application of the principle of reciprocity, to reverse it.     9.  We  are left thus with methods (b) and (c), collective agreements  andbilateral negotiations.  These methods are alike in the respect  that they bothembody the principle  of  reciprocity;  this makes both of them potentially more effective instruments for promoting  a widespread reduction of tariffs  than  theautonomous action of  individual  Governments can be under the world conditionsof  the present  day.   These two  methods are alike again in that  the existing
most-favour ed-natibh clause presents itself as an obstacle in both cases, and the attempt to apply dither method extensively is thus likely to lead to a revolt againstthe clause in its present  form.   But the pursuit  of the  method  of bilateral negotiations would  constitute in bur judgment a far more serious threat to the essentials of the most-favoured-natioh clause than would the pursuit of collective agreements.    10.   We are, indeed,  at present in a phase of bilateral negotiations  withregard to tariffs; Great Britain is taking a foremost  part in them, and even atthis early stage the experience  of  these negotiations serves to confirm the state-ments  in  the  preceding  paragraph.  The  debate  on  the World, EconomicConference, which took place in the House of Commons on the 15th March, 1933,was significant in this connection.  A motion was proposed urging  the BritishGovernment, among other matters, &quot; to take the initiative in the formation of a group  of free-trade or low-tariff  countries,  and to make agreements for such modifications in the most-favoured-natioh clauses of existing treaties as may benecessary.&quot;  To this motion  an  amendment was  moved, urging the BritishGovernment  to bo  ready  &quot; so to modify existing treaties as to  give tariffadvantages to those countries which are  ready to reciprocate in the promotion of freer trade and to raise tariffs  against those countries which do not desire toreciprocate.&quot;   Thus the most-favoured-nation clause was subjected to criticism.both from the advocates of low  tariff  agreements and from  those concerned primarily to improve the bargaining position  of Great Britain in the existingcommercial negotiations.  In the course of the debate, the President of the Boardof Trade, referring to the trade negotiations now in  progress, used the following-words :          &quot;Moreover,  in negotiating,  both sides must make concessions.   I want    to make it clear that if any nation sits back in the hope that we will enter    into successful  negotiations with another power and that they will be able    to  achieve most-favoured-nation treatment without consideration  coming    from them, they will come to a deadlock.  If they gain any  advantages from    us, they must be reciprocal in their  action.   They must be ready to make    concessions similar to  ours and  to those of other countries.  Unless they do    that, we cannot agree to most-favbured-natiOn  treatment being  retained as    a permanent element in the conditions which control their traffic and  ours.    If it is used against us in  any instance we will  drop it at once, and we will    be ready to enter into individual  relationships without  regard to most-    favoured-nation treatment in such cases  as  I have in mind.  I hope those    who now are doing so, after discussing it with us, will bear in mind, therefore.    the fact that while this system plays such a large part in the commercial life    of this country, we are not so firmly wedded to  it that we can allow it to be    used to our disadvantage.&quot;This passage, hypothetical though it was. marks, none the less, a noteworthychange in the  attitude of the  British  Government  towards the most-favoured-nation clause.  It  illustrates,  moreover,  the  difficulty,  which we believe - to befundamental, of reconciling the clause with any extensive pursuit of the methodof bilateral negotiations.    11.   The  main  purpose of  bilateral  negotiations  is  to  obtain  speciallyfavourable  treatment  from  the   other  party.   The  main  purpose  of themost-favoured-nation clause is  to prohibit special favours. It is true that, under present  conditions, the  existence  of  abnormal trade  impediments,  such  asexchange restrictions, quota schemes, &amp;c.,&apos; provides considerable scope, outsidethe.sphere of tariffs, for mutually advantageous bargains between two countries..without running up against the veto of  the most-favoured-nation clause.  It i&amp;further true that the possibilities of reducing tariff rates upon goods which are largely imported from the other  country, and sub-dividing tariff classificationsso as to discriminate between its specialities and those of rival producers, affordssome scope  for such bargains within  the  tariff sphere.   But these are the exceptions which prove the rule, in the proper meaning of the phrase.  Notoriously.to the extent to which the flow of international trade is determined by exchange restrictions  and quota schemes,  most-favoured-nation  treatment is  renderednugatory; and already the international commercial air resounds with complaints of  adverse discrimination in the  administration of these restrictions.   In this
                                     %connection, we may quote a further passage from the speech of the President ofthe Board of Trade :-         &quot; I  would like to point  out  in passing that, although most-favoured-    nation treatment plays a part in those treaties, there are some cases, such    as France, where most-favoured-nation treatment is not likely to be continued    to us.  The quota system, as it has been worked in France, may become really    a form of discrimination.  It has been my duty to draw the attention of the    French representative to the way that  discrimination  in  other matters  is    operating to our detriment, and we may have to take the matter further.  We    cannot allow it to rest whei&apos;e it is.  There has been discrimination with regard    to the surtax in France.  We are  not  receiving the most-favoured-nation    treatment there.   France is giving  Belgium advantages which are not held    by the citizens of this country.  Again, we have not only to draw the attention    of the French to this fact,  but we have to make it clear that it is a condition    to which we cannot permanently be parties, and the time  must arrive when    action is necessary with regard to  their exclusion of us  from  the benefits    which they give to others.&quot;Similarly, the practice of conferring favours by means of tariff classification hasalways been  regarded  as an objectionable one,  amounting to an  evasion  of themost-favoured-natipn clause.    12.  In expressing, therefore, our belief that the active pursuit of the methodof bilateral negotiations is likely to entail &quot; first, an increasing evasion &quot;  of themost-favoured-nation clause. &quot;  and ultimately its general abrogation.&quot; we are notconjuring up a vision of a remote and speculative clanger, we are calling attentionto a tendency which is already at work, and, indeed, in the course of a developmentso rapid that it is manifestly undermining the  traditional maxims of  british commercial policy.   It  is still  less than  a year  and a half since the commercial policy of Great Britain was essentially one of Free Trade; and, as a Free Tradecountry, we  were  accustomed  to  regard the most-favoured-nation clause as aninvaluable safeguard of British interests in a world which maintained high tariffs and was disposed to tariff bargains.   We are now actively engaged in using thepower to exclude imports from the British markets as a lever to  extract favourable terms for  British  exports, dealing with our customers  one  by one:  and theimportance of the British market  to many other countries  is so great that  we are becoming conscious that we have  at our disposal a  bargaining weapon which ispotentially far stronger than any which  other countries have enjoyed in the past.The change has been so recent that we  have  not as yet fully adjusted ourselves to its implications: we have not as yet sought to denonnce the  most-favoured-nation clause; nor have we decidedly  abandoned our attitude of extolling  it as a valuable safeguard of  British  commercial interests.   But, as the above extractssufficiently reveal, there is a noticeable  waning in  the  wholeheartedness  of our attitude; and the present phase  is manifestly  a transitional one.  Increasinglywe shall find, along the road  of bilateral negotiations, that the  most-favoured-nation   clause limits   our power  to exploit   the  full  potentialities  of the bargaining-instrument of the  British market.   Increasingly we  shall find thatthe clause prevents us from retaliating effectively against  adverse discrimination in the administration of quota  schemes and exchange controls.  The disposition to free  ourselves from these  limitations  will  grow correspondingly.   In  othercountries,  similar reasons for discontent with the most-favoured-nation clausewill accumulate.     13.   It seems to us important to  consider whither we are  heading, while weare still in the transitional phase, and while the most-favoured-nation clause isstill intact.  Some of the disadvantages  which would arise if the  most-favoured-nation  clause were to  disappear  from the world&apos;s commercial treaties, and thetrade relations of different countries were to  be governed  by a  complex series  of bilateral bargains, were excellently stated by the President of the Board of Trade in the speech from which we have already made quotations :          &quot; One advantage of the most-favoured-nation clause is that it ensures a     general  absence of discrimination, and that in itself is a great advantage for     our business men here. Furthermore, if we had not the most-favoured-nation     clause in our commercial  treaties, it would be necessary for us to deal with
    every item in our tariffs, with probably a different series of rates applicable    to particular countries, and the duties which would have to be considered by    our business men, our contractors, our salesmen and those who are drawing-    up estimates would be enormous almost beyond imagination.  Every item of    every country, all varying and none of them on any one settled principle and    covering such a variety of conditions, make it almost impossible for the    ordinary business  man to know where he is.   The  advantage of the most-    favoured-nation clause as it stands at present is that he can look at the tariffs    and  see what  is  the lowest  rate,  and  he  knows  that  he is  entitled by    commercial treaties to claim  that treatment.  He  knows  that  that  is an    advantage which ought not to be too readily thrown away.&quot;But there would also be dangers of a far graver kind.  Detailed discriminationwould almost  certainly provoke  detailed retaliation.   An  era  of  intensifiedeconomic warfare would  be opened  up.    Complete anarchy  would replace the elements of order and uniformity which have hitherto existed in the international commercial sphere.   These seem  to us by no means remote contingencies along the path of bilateral negotiations;  and they are contingencies Avhich should disturba  foreign-trading country like Great  Britain,  even  though  the bargaining position with which we would enter into this anarchy might be initially strong.    14.  It is from a  sense of these dangers that we urge that  the British.Government should give serious and sympathetic consideration to the method of collective agreements.   We are not  blind to the difficulties in the wa3r of such agreements; and we do not suggest that  the problem they present is an easy one.We are convinced, however, that the method  of collective  low-tariff agreementsrepresents the true via media between the probably barren method of autonomousaction on the one hand  and the dangerous method of  bilateral negotiations on theother.  This method would give reasonable scope to  the  principle  of  reciprocitywhile providing safeguards against the danger that this  principle  may lead to aheightening of tariffs, retaliation and unlimited confusion.  It is hardly too muchto say that the essential problem in connexion with tariffs is to effect a reasonablecompromise  between the   principles  of  reciprocity  and  most-favoured-nation treatment, neither of which can safely  be allowed  to devour the other.   Themethod of collective  low-tariff agreements would effect such a compromise; andfor this reason we remain  of the opinion  that it offers the only practicable meansof real progress in the direction  of lower tariffs.
                  AN  INTERNATIONAL NOTE-ISSUE.    15.  In our  first  report, we  argued that a solution of  the international financial problem was  an essential prerequisite of the  solution of the other problems with which the conference is faced.  We pointed out that the abnormaltrade impediments which have been imposed in recent years are for the most part the direct  and natural  outcome of the international financial  crisis, and  weinferred that though it would doubtless be comparatively easy to secure resolutionsdeploring the growth of  these trade  impediments,  it  would  probably prove impracticable  &quot; to make any considerable progress towards their removal so longas the financial conditions which have given rise  to  them prevail &quot;.  We  are confirmed in this view by the course of discussion at the Preparatory Commission.The account which is given in the report of the Commission of the causes whichhave led to the growth of trade restrictions is very similar to that which we gaveourselves, laying stress on such matters as the natural preoccupation of the weakerfinancial countries with their  trade balances and  exchange stability,  and  the anxiety of the stronger financial countries to maintain  a measure of stability  fortheir  home producers amid the demoralisation of world  price conditions.  Thereport of the Commission concludes its account with the following observation :          &quot;  The foregoing summary is not intended in any way to justify  the    restrictions;  none the less, it seems desirable to indicate the causes which    have led to their adoption, since the most effective way of  endeavouring to    bring about the removal of these grave obstacles to trade will be to attack    their causes.&quot;    10.  We argued  further that in order to break through the existing inter-national financial deadlock, it was essential to secure an increase in the supply ofinternational purchasing power at the disposal of the weaker financial countries.We expressed  scepticism as to the possibility of meeting this need by internationalloans from the creditor countries; and we turned therefore to the possibilityof meeting it by action within the monetary sphere.  We examined and supported the proposal which had already been put forward by the Committee on economic information that the Bank for International Settlements should be authorised toissue  international certificates, to be accepted by Governments as the equivalent of gold, as the basis  of a scheme  for advances from the  Bank of international settlements to Governments.  We pointed out that this idea was  capable of being applied in a great variety of ways.  The Committee on  Economic information had suggested that advances might be made  at a nominal rate of interest to all governments agreeing to participate in the scheme up to a large aggregate sumof, say,  1,000  millions  gold,  this  sum  being distributed  among  them  inaccordance with  some agreed criterion of economic importance.  We suggested as an alternative plan which might possibly stand a greater chance of acceptancethat the advances might be  limited to loans to the Governments of financiallyembarrassed countries, and might carry a gilt-edged rate of  interest.   both these  plans included  provisions for the gradual  recall  of the advances  andcancellation of the notes in  the event of a rise in world prices, together withother technical features which we need not recapitulate.    17.  We  are grateful to the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the privilege of studying the observations of the Treasury upon these  proposals.   We under -stand that  the Treasury have no criticisms to offer from the economic or technicalstandpoints, but  agree that there would be much to be said for  a scheme on  theabove lines if  other important countries could be persuaded to accept it.  In  theopinion of  the Treasury, however, there would be no real chance of the acceptanceeither of the larger scheme suggested by the Committee  on Economic Information,or of  the more limited scheme which we had suggested as an alternative;  andthat the latter scheme would be even less likely to win acceptance than the former.In these circumstances,  moreover,  the Treasury would regard it as  unwise  forthe British Government to put forward any such proposal, on  the ground thatdistrust of sterling might be  aroused if we were to appear as champions of what       [8397]                                                       c
would be described as novel and organised inflation.   The  Treasury agreed,however, that it might be an advantage if the  Preparatory Commission couldbe induced, preferably at the instance of a continental  representative, to spendsome lime in the exploration of proposals of this character.     18.  Finally, the Treasury, as we understand their position, do not question the need for action in the monetary sphere  to remedy the international financialposition, and are disposed to suggest, as representing a more promising approachthan that  of  an  international  note-issue, some scheme  by  which  countriespossessing surplus gold reserves  would in  effect  deposit  part  of their  excessreserves with the Bank for International Settlements, thus providing a basis uponwhich the Bank for International  Settlements might make advances to financiallydistressed countries.     19.  We have recognised from  the first that so  unfamiliar  an idea as thatof international gold note-issue was not likely to commend  itself immediately tothe other Governments represented at the World Conference.  But while  we donot think we underrate the  difficulties which stand in the way of its acceptance,we are loth to believe that a proposal which is sound in its economic and technicalaspects  (and no criticism has yet been made of  it in those aspects), and  whichis well-adapted to meet the fundamental needs of the economic situation (and nocriticism has been made of  the  diagnosis on which we base this claim), must be dismissed as utterly impracticable merely because it conflicts with certain instinc-tive  prejudices and  lends  itself easily to misunderstanding  and superficialridicule.  There are,  moreover, two  reasons why  the proposal  may prove  lessinacceptable than  it would seem at first  sight,  the one  concerned  with  thecharacter of the proposal itself, the other  with  the  developments of the  world situation.     20.   In the first place, the suggestion  of an international note-issue is by no means so eccentric  or bizarre,  so cut off from the wisdom and experience ofthe past, as may be supposed.  It  represents the application to the internationalsphere of the classic  prescription evolved by trial and  error,  and approved by-abundant experience,  for  treating  an  internal  financial  crisis.   It  was  notuncommon in England in the last century  for one or two sensational businessfailures  to precipitate a general  financial panic, in  which creditors demandedfrom their debtors repayments which were beyond their  power and in which thepublic began to &quot; run &quot; upon the banks for cash.   By long and painful experiencewe learnt the method  of dealing  with a situation of this  type.  The Bank ofEngland must be freed from the normal limitations upon its right to issue notes;and, so fortified, it must lend readily to all  applicants who  had good security tooffer. In other words, an internal financial crisis must be met by Central Bankadvances made possible by an emergency increase of the  currency.  This remedyis being applied at the present  moment by  the authorities of the United states as the means of dealing with the present banking crisis in that country.     21.   The necessity for applying this remedy to an acute  financial crisis arises from the essential characteristics  of  the modern credit  system.  The supply of legal-tender currency in a modern community amounts normally to only a smallfraction of the money claims which the public hold in the form of bank depositsor other supposedly liquid forms.  If accordingly, for whatever reason, creditorsgenerally press their debtors for cash payment, an augmentation of the currency,until such times as normal  confidence is restored, is essential, if  widespreaddefault  with far-reaching and disastrous repei-cussions is to be avoided.  Nor is there anything  inflationary  in  the  augmentation  of the currency under suchconditions.  The additional currency serves merely to counteract the decline ineffective purchasing-power resulting from the loss of confidence and the reluctance to give credit.     22.   Now it is of the essence of  our international difficulties that we have a crisis in the sphere of international  financial relations analogous to an internalbanking crisis.   In the last two years we have seen international &quot; runs &quot; upon
 countries, upon  Germany, upon Great Britain, even upon the United States.* A country suddenly called upon to meet an external run finds itself in essentially the same difficulty as a bank confronted with a run by its depositors.  Its long- term position may be  sound and solvent;  but it  does not follow that  it has immediately at its command gold or foreign exchange sufficient to meet all the external demands that  may be made upon it.  It may be  driven accordingly  to some such expedient as a &quot; standstill &apos;&apos; agreement which is analogous to a banking moratorium or to a  depreciation of  its currency which is equivalent from the international standpoint to a composition of so much in the pound.  Meanwhile all countries become anxious to safeguard or improve the  &quot; liquidity &quot; of their international position;  they are less willing either to buy  or to lend,  expressing this  unwillingness  by  means  of quota schemes,  exchange  restrictions  and embargoes on foreign lending; and the lack of international financial confidence thus  contributes with a formidable power to the progressive curtailment  of the volume of international trade.     23.   If an  internal financial crisis  was  allowed to proceed unchecked,  it would exercise similarly devastating effects upon the volume  of internal trade activity.  Within a country, however, effective organs of government exist, which, sooner or later, slip in  to take remedial action.  The absence of  effective organs of government in the international sphere admittedly makes the task of inter- national action far more difficult.   But the principle upon which such  action should be based  is the same.   For a crisis of confidence in the sphere of inter- national financial relations, a  special increase in the supply of internationally accepted money, which will make debtors more able to pay their external creditors, and creditors  less anxious to obtain immediate payment from their  external debtors, is the fundamentally appropriate remedy.  There is nothing inflationary in such a proposal, any more than in  an increase  of currency to deal with an internal banking crisis,  though we should certainly hope that it  would facilitate a recovery of prices sufficient to redress the  extreme disequilibrium  which has recently grown up between prices on the one hand and costs  and  debts on the other.     24.   Our second reason for urging that the inacceptability of our proposal should not  be  taken for granted  is the new plasticity of  public opinion in all countries under deepening misfortune.  As we observed in our previous report:          &quot; In  the absence of a constructive policy, the international financial     problem is likely to remain with  us for a long period to come, and the sense     of the  vital necessity of solving  it may be expected to grow rather than  to     diminish.  In these circumstances it would be short-sighted to refrain from     putting forward proposals now, merely because time may be required to win     for them general acceptance.&quot; Since we  wrote these words, the situation has already developed in a way that offers a  distinctly better prospect for the  acceptance of bold  proposals than existed a  few months ago.  There has been a rapid growth of the sense that the present situation is one of desperate gravity, and that a prolonged continuance ofthe present deflationary trend  throughout  the  world will threaten  the  whole structure  of credit  and contract and  perhaps  of  social  order.    There  is an increasing disbelief that so  formidable a situation will either  right itself or be corrected  by narrowly conventional policies  supplemented  by expedients impro-vised to meet the latest symptoms of deterioration.  Moreover, the recognition that our troubles are truly  world troubles  and call  for  concerted international   *  Tho following extract from a speech by Mr. Hoover ab the Lincoln Day Dinner of theNational  Republican Club in New York on the 13th February,  1933, is of interest in thisconnection :         &quot; To add to the confusion,  another phenomenon of the gold situation has increased   disturbance and wrought havoc.  That is the effect of waves of fear and apprehension.  We   have a parallel in nations  to an  unreasoning panic run on a bank.   The fears and appre-   apprehensions directed in turn to the stability of first one nation and then another have caused the   withdrawal of foreign balances from a particular nation, followed by flights of capital, through    purchases of exchange by its own citizens seeking refuge and security for their property.   Those movements are followed by large flows of gold to meet exchange demands, thus under-    mining the domestic currency and  credit  system of the victim nation and leading to an   unnatural piling up of gold in some nation temporarily considered  safe.&quot;       [8397]                                                         c  2
action has made rapid strides.  We do not suggest that these changes of opinionhave yet gone far enough to overcome all the prejudices and resistances which theproposal of an international note-issue would  arouse.   But we suggest that itwould imply a lack of foresight,  a lack of imaginative  perception of the transi-tional nature of opinion in times of rapid change, to treat the probable  attitudeof Continental bankers at the moment as a sufficient reason for dismissing aninherently sound project as impracticable.    25.  The drift of events and of opinion has an even stronger bearing uponthe contention that His Majesty&apos;s Government  should refrain from  putting forward publicly such a proposal as that for an international note-issue,  for fear that this would arouse distrust of the pound in Continental eyes.  The Treasurycomments in which this argument was used were written some months ago. What-ever force it may have then seemed reasonable to attach to it,  we do not thinkthat it now retains any substantial validity.  Largely owing to the misfortunesof other countries, the financial  prestige of Great  Britain, with her balancedbudget and her strong banking system, is again very high; and it would take morethan  the  public advocacy  of  a project for international  action  at  the world conference to disturb it. We are, indeed, once  more  in the unquestioned  positionof a financially strong country; and it would not  be consistent with the respon-sibilities of  that position, if we were to refrain from giving the world a lead and proposing what we believed to be right, merely from a fear that our motives mightbe misunderstood.    26.  The drift of events has also, in our opinion, removed the feasibility ofthe type of plan preferred by the  Treasury, for a pooling of surplus gold reserveswith the Bank for International Settlements, as a basis for advances to financiallydistressed countries.   For with  the growth of both internal and international financial distrust, it is improbable that any country would agree that  it couldprudently afford to immobilise any part of its gold reserves.  In the United states the combination of an internal with an external gold drain in the recent  bankingcrisis quickly swallowed up most of the large surplus gold reserves of the federal reserve system; and though internal gold hoarding has now been effectively pro-hibited, the renewal of a flight from the dollar remains an ever-present possibility.In France a serious gold-hoarding movement might begin in the event of any un-toward development.  Switzerland, whose surplus  gold reserves mainly representthe deposit of foreign  balances, might at any time have to face  a withdrawal ofthose  balances.  Indeed, we are now entering on a phase of the world crisis inwhich the distinction between financially strong and financially weak countries is becoming blurred.  The position of every country  to-day is, in some degree, p re-carious; and this,  we fear, renders fundamentally  impracticable any plan whichrests on the principle  of the stronger countries coming to the assistance of theweaker, whether by a pooling of surplus gold reserves, or by  organised inter-national loans.    27.  The same consideration  suggests that  of the two alternative variants ofthe international  note-issue project set out in our previous Report, the largerscheme, originally put forward by the Committee on  Economic Information, may perhaps be  the better adapted to the psychological as well as to the economicrequirements of the present situation. It might be better, that is to say, to proposethat Bank for  International Settlements advances  should be made available at a nominal rate of interest to every Government which complied with the conditionsof the scheme, rather than limited to especially distressed countries.   A schemeframed upon these lines would exert a far stronger recuperative influence, as were recognised in our previous  report. We suggested the more limited scheme merely as an alternative which might offer a greater prospect of acceptance.  We think,however, that there is force in the Treasury comment that  the limitations would remove  much of the potential attractiveness of the idea to countries like Franceand the United States.  We conclude, therefore, that the bolder scheme is the onewhich should be put forward at the Conference, at all events in the first instance.The main outlines of this scheme  are recapitulated as an appendix to this report.    28.  We urge, therefore, that in the interval before the World Conferencemeets His Majesty&apos;s Government should consider very seriously the  question ofproposing to the Conference a large scheme for an international note-issue as  a major constructive remedy for the world&apos;s economic  troubles.  We recognise that
there is likely to be a reluctance to adopt such a course owing to the technical and difficult nature of monetary questions.  There is an obvious advantage in puttingin the forefront  of a policy, designed to impress world opinion and to win -worldsupport, propositions of a nature which can be widely and readily understood inall their implications, reserving more technical proposals, whatever their intrinsicimportance, for  unostentatious discussion in expert sub-committees.   We  doubt,however, whether the present problem lends itself to such treatment.  If proposalsof a monetary type are to be kept in the background, we are unable to see in whatquarter ideas  can be found calculated to strike the world&apos;s imagination and to stimulate hone.     29.  We are confirmed in this view  by our study of the Draft  AnnotatedAgenda submitted by the Preparatory Commission of Experts.  The experts are,we think,  to  be congratulated on their success both  m finding  formulas to reconcile divergent standpoints over so  many problems  and in presenting soobjective and so well-balanced a survey of the various issues.   None the less, themain impression that  a  study of  the  document conveys is  one of the  extreme difficulty that is likely to be  encountered  in each  several sphere in securing agreement  of  a  concrete and effective  character.   The danger is manifest thatthe Conference may lose its way in the dreary discussion of inherently fruitlessformulas.     30.  The only means of averting this danger is the submission of constructive proposals which go to  the root of the causes of the world&apos;s economic  difficulties.This, we claim,  the proposal which we advocate does.  We repeat that,  so faras we are aware, the technical merits of the proposal have not been challenged.In these circumstances, though the proposal itself is  technical in character, thequestion whether it would be wise to bring it forward  is not a technical issue, buta broad issue of statesmanship.

                                 ANNEX.   Scheme for  an international  note  issue as originally suggested  by  the                  Committee  on  Economic Information.    IN paragraph 48 of their fourth report (Council paper E.A.C. (S.C.) 4), theCommittee on Economic Information summarised their scheme as follows :         &quot; (a)  The Bank for  International Settlements might make advances, at    a  very  low rate of interest, or  possibly free of interest, to the various    Governments of  the world, up to  an aggregate sum of, say,  1,000 millions    gold,  this sum being distributed among them in accordance with some agreed    criterion of economic importance.....The advances could be made subject    to appropriate conditions,  such as the  removal of restrictions  on exchange    dealings.        (&amp;)  To enable it to do so, the Bank for International Settlements would    be authorised to  issue International Certificates, declared to be the equivalent    of so  many grains of gold, and accepted as such by the various Governments,    up to the amount of the  advances  made.        (c)  If  and when the gold price level of commodities rose substantially,    the advances would be gradually recalled and the issue of certificates reduced    correspondingly.   It would  be the object of  the Bank  for International    Settlements, m determining the proportion of  the advances to be  recalled at    any time,  to  prevent  an  undue  rise  of prices,  without  precipitating  a    recurrence of depression by an over-drastic curtailment.  If any Government    was unable to make immediate repayment of any sum when called  upon  to do    so, the advance of this sum might be extended at a comparatively high rate    of interest.&quot;        (NOTE. In  our last  report we suggested as an additional provision that    &quot; a country which was  subject to an outward movement of funds should    not be entitled to meet this  outflow entirely  by  a release of International    Certificates, but should  be required  to release part passu a  proportional    amount of gold.&quot;)
FTiO  332      SUPPLEMENTARY  NOTE  ON  CERTAIN           ASPECTS  OF  SHIPPING  POLICY,    We note with satisfaction  that the Preparatory  Commission of Expertsappreciate the importance of the abolition of Government subsidies to shipping,which, along with other artificial measures, disturb the channels of international trade.    We observe, however, that the Preparatory Commission suggest that&quot; certainpossibilities of agreement might be considered with regard  to the scrapping of old tonnage, the utilisation of existing tonnage and  the laying down  of  new ships.&quot;  If the Commission contemplate international schemes for the scrappingof old tonnage, coupled with the building of newr tonnage, we are opposed to thissuggestion.  We hope that no support will be given by the British delegates at theconference to a policj&apos; of increasing or maintaining the surplus of tonnage by an artificial stimulus to the building of ships.    According to Lloyd&apos;s Register of British and Foreign Shipping, the world&apos;ssteamship and motor tonnage in June 1932 amounted to 68,368,141 gross tons, ascompared with 44,000,000 gross tons in June 1914.  Since 1929 world trade hasdecreased by 50 per cent.; over 13,000,000 gross tons of world shipping, nearly 20per cent, of the whole,  is laid up, while liner tonnage is trading with a large amount of empty space.    Advocates in this  country  of the   policy of  granting facilities  for thescrapping of old ships,  and the building of new ships in their  place, base theirarguments partly on the mistaken assumption that the British mercantile marineis less modern than that of its competitors.  The following table shows the world&apos;stonnage and the percentage of that total under 5 years of age, under 10 years ofage, and over 20 years of age, with  comparable  figures for  the tonnage ofGreat Britain.                        World Ship-ping, June 1932.                     (Total gross tonnage ^ 68,368,141.)                                                          Percentage of                                        Gross Tonnage.      Total Tonnage.        Under 5 vears       ...       ...    11,074,117          16-2        Under 10 years     ...       ...    20,572,741          30-1        Twenty years and over       ...    18,484,923          27 0                       British Shipping, June  1932.                     (Total gross tonnage = 19,562,143.)                                                         Percentage of                                        Gross Tonnage.      Total Tonnage.        Under 5 years       ...       ...     3,941,140          20-1        Under 10 years     ...       ...     8,007,701          40-9        Twenty years and over       ...     3,574,154          18-from the above it will be seen that our mercantile marine compares favourably with world tonnage generally. Moreover, Great Britain has a larger proportionof tonnage under 10 years of age and a smaller proportion  of tonnage over20 years of age  than any other  country,  though in the  case of Germany thedifference in our  favour is small.    In our opinion no support should be given to any scheme which provides fora combination of the scrapping of existing ships and the building of new tonnage.The force of circumstances will, in itself,  bring about the necessary scrapping.It is only lack of demand for, and the low price of  scrap, that is at  presentretarding this process.    Attractive as it would be to provide work for the shipbuilders and engineersof this country,  the unnecessary building of ships  would only aggravate,  andprolong, the present shipping depression.
