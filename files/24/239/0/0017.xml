IS DOCUMENT  IS  THE PROPERTY  OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT.3RET.&apos;.67(35).COPY NO.3 6CAB I N E T.PART I OF THE COAL MTITSS ACT^J^950^Memorandum by the Presidant of the Board of Trade.   1. within the next few days, there may be comment inParliament and in the Press on a statement which I have feltmyself obliged to make to the coal owners; I am anxious,therefore, both to inform my colleagues of the position and toobtain their approval of my action.   2. After consultation with the Secretary for Mines, I was satisfied that the Schemes in force under Part I of the CoalMines Act, 1930, must be maintained in operation.   Theirtermination would be followed by a severe fall in coal prices which would be reflected in miners&apos; wages and would lead to industrial trouble.   3. The li-fe&apos;  of the Schemes was extended for fi^e years(i.e. until 31st December, 1937), by the Goal.Mines Act, 1932,on the implied condition that they would be amended in thoserespects which experience had shown to he necessary..   4. The coalowners have devoted considerable attention to -this, but largely owing to the opposition of certain districts,Scotland and Northumberland in particular (which have alwaysbeen opposed to the Act) they have so far been unable tosecure the majority of 85 per cent, requisite for the submission for approval of amendments to the Central Scheme.   5. We cannot, in my view, wait very much longer for thecoalowners to make up their minds.   Increased coal export trade-1-
 is  in  the  forefront  of  the  British  desiderata in the trade negotiations now in  progress.    If, as I hope, these negotiations are shortly brought to a satisfactory conclusion with the Scandinavian countries,  no opportunity must be given to  the foreign buyers to claim  that &quot;lack of quota&quot; has released them from  their  obligations-    It is essential, therefore, that the Central Scheme should be amended to permit of separate output allocations for the export trade so that if necessary that trade may  be actually or virtually  freed from quantitative control.   At the same  time, in  order to secure for the industry full economic advantage from the  operation of the Schemes and to assist in  checking evasions there must be inter-district co-ordination of minimum prices.   6. In view of the urgency of  the matter, I have informed the Chairman of the  Central Council  of  Coalowners that unless by the middle of April  the Council  submit amendments of the Central Scheme providing for separate export allocations and for inter-district co-ordination of  minimum prices, I shall have no alternative but  to recommend to  the Cabinet that the Government should introduce legislation to  give to the Board of Trade general powers of amendment of the Central Scheme in order that these two  amendments may be made.   7* I hope that this will be sufficient to induce the Council to reach agreement.   If not, the legislation required would be a short Bill in  which it would be provided that the Board of Trade could act with regard to any amendment if it had the support of a two-thirds majority  of the industry.   Each amendment would, in  addition, require the positive approval ofboth. Houses of Parliaments   8. I shall  be glad to know that my colleagues concur in theaction I have  taken and that they are prepared to authorise meto announce to the House that the policy of His Majesty&apos;s-S-
1*1iGovernment, should the Central Council not produce the amendments by the middle of April, is to introduce soon afterBaster a Bill conferring the necessary powers on the Board ofTrade.TJ. R.rd of Trade,16th March,  1933.
