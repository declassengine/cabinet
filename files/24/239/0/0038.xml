fl 5 C  RET.                CAB I NET.     REORGANISATION OP THE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY.     Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.     My colleagues will remember that when in April  1932duties were imposed on iron and steel on the recommendationof the Import Duties Advisory Committee, I reported  to theCabinet that- one of the intentions of the Committee  in recommending the duties was to stimulate reorganisation inthe industry.   Sir George May and his colleagues have beenactively pursuing this object and a National Committee ofrepresentatives of the Iron and Steel Industry has now submitted a scheme under which reorganisation can takeplace.   I circulate herewith the papers which I havereceived from Sir George May on the subject.   I should propose, if the Cabinet approves, to reply to him in thefollowing terms which I have agreed with the President ofthe Board of Trade.     &quot;Dear Sir George May,           I have to thank you for your letter of the      27th March covering various documents concerning      the draft scheme for the future reorganisation of      the Iron and Steel Industry together with your own      Memorandum on the same subject.           I have now carefully considered these documents      and after consultation with my colleagues I desire      to make the following observations upon them.O.P.  88(53).COPY NO. //-     From the outset the.Government have made  cleartheir view that an efficient and prosperous iron andsteel industry is essential to this country, andthat the duties imposed on foreign imports were
intended to provide opportunity for there organisation which was necessary for thispurpose.   From the beginning also they haveexpressed, the opinion that those engaged inthe industry were best qualified to formulate asatisfactory scheme or schemes, and recognisingall the difficulties which had to be overcome theyhave been ready to afford reasonable time fororderly and careful planning so long as theycould be satisfied that proper progress was beingmade.     Accordingly I welcome the evidence nowafiorded that work on reorganisation has been steadily proceeding and I regard the present proposals as constituting a real step forward inthe required direction.     You will however recognise that only the first stage has been reached and that much remains to bedone before the industry can be said to be properlyequipped and organised.     I trust, therefore, that the industry as awhole and all sections thereof will press on withthe work which they have so well begun.   I under-stand. that opinion in the industry is still over-overwhelmingly against invoking compulsory powers, andI hope that the industry will be able to bring abouta proper measure of reorganisation on a voluntary basis.     While the Government must necessarily reservecomplete discretion as to the precise action,legislative or otherwise, they may deem it expedient to take in any circumstances which may arise, I desireto assure you and them that, so long as the Governmentis satisfied of the determination of the industry toset its house in order, they will be ready to give such support to its efforts as may from tine to timeappear necessary to enable this great enterprise tobe brought to a successful conclusion.     I shall be glad if you will keep me informed ofthe progress made.:&quot;(Initialled)   N.C.&apos;reasury Chambers, S. W. 1.      51st March,  1935.

                       ENCLOSURE  II,.                   -     g 11        THE REORGANISATION OF THE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY.MEMORANDUM 3Y THE CHAIRMAN OF TEE IMPORT DUTIES ADVISORY  COMMITTEE.          It is now 10 months since the Import Duties Advisory   Committee were invited by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to   endeavour to carry through a reorganisation of the Iron  and   Steel Industry in connection with the grant of protection and   matters have at last reached a stage at which it is possible  to   report progress.          Before receiving that invitation the Committee  had   already given some consideration to the economic position of  the   industry.   In their first report they expressed the view that   this industry could not be dealt with on the broad lines   adopted in that report in the case of other industries;   a prosperous iron and steel industry was regarded as essential   alike to the economic progress of the country and to the   national security and we recommended an exceptional level cf   protection as a temporary measure pending the preparation of a   permanent scheme for placing the industry again on a sound   foot ing.          In view of the great complexity of the problem  -  the   so called iron and steel industry being in fact a collection of   ten or a dozen industries closely inter-twined with each other  -   we early came to the conclusion that it would be very  much   better from every point of view if the industry could  be induced   to undertake its own reorganisation rather than that a scheme   should be imposed upon it against its opposition by external   authority.   We have throughout striven to this end and  still   remain of this opinion.          We began by calling a conference fully representative   of the producers of iron and steel and suggested the appointment   of a series of committees to work out a scheme.   We ourselves                              -5-
nominated a national committee for this purpose  and  thiscommittee in turn appointed a smaller executive  committee,four regional committees and four sub-committees for wroughtiron, steel castings, forgings and special  steels respectively.At that conference v/e made it clear that provided the indusrty was prepared to carry through a satisfactory scheme  of reorganisation it was our intention to recommend &quot;such ameasure of protection as was necessary to make that  schemeeffective&quot;.       The discussions thus initiated undoubtedly led toa more hopeful outlook in the industry and  tended to develop a spirit of co-operation, but actual progress in thepreparation of a scheme of reorganisation was very slow and inSeptember we decided that we must take definite action to helpmatters forward.   We accordingly arranged a series  of meetings with the individual members of the Executive Committee and discussed the position frankly with them.   They all admittedthe lack of progress and in the course of discussion we gathered that the true explanation was that the industry was stronglyon the defensive against current ideas that reorganisationsimply meant extensive compulsory amalgamations and that it was accordingly devoting its energies to  trying to build up astructure  of price  and sale agreements on the shifting sandsof existing trade associations.       We  expressed the view  that the problem was far toointricate  for any simple  solution and that  in any case we heldno brief for any particular line  of  aporoach.   We were  stillanxious that the solution  should  be  one  for which they acceptedresponsibility  but  we  offered to  lend them  the  services  ofSir  Alfred Hurst  in a  consultative  capacity if  they so desired.The  results  of  these personal discussions were  seen in a meetingof  the Executive Committee on the 10th  October  which I attended whenthe  Committee  gave  me  a  unanimous assurance  that  they would proceed                            -6-
forthwith to prepare a scheme and they subsequently invitedSir Alfred Hurst to assist them.    Apart from any assistance  that sir Alfred Hurst may have been able to render in the course of subsequent proceedings his co-operation with the industry hasbeen invaluable in giving the Advisory Committee fullerknowledge of the forces, personalities, opinions, etc.,  at workin the industry.  Not only has he attended numerous meetingsof the Committees referred to above but several trade associations in the industry have also been glad to uvailthemselves of his help.       The outcome of the proceedings of the past five months is seen in the enclosed letter from the Chairman  of theNational Committee submitting a scheme for the future organisation of the industry with covering  memorandum.  A copyof the minutes of the meeting of the National Committee  atwhich the scheme was accepted in general outline is alsoappended.   In view of the nature of the scheme the personnel of this Committee had been extended for this meeting to include representatives of the consuming interests affected by  thescheme.       As stated in Mr. Mitchell&apos;s letter the resolution of approval was carried by 26 votes to 6, and of the sixdissentients three are makers of foundry iron, who did  not object to the scheme per se, but considered that their  interests were not sufficiently identified with those of other producers of iron and steel to make it desirable that they should participate in the scheme.   This view was raised unexpectedlyat the final meeting, and there is some prospect that it may  be considerably modified as a result of further discussion. Of  theother dissentients, the only steel producer is Mr. Walter Grayof the Steel Company of Scotland - a firm responsible in 1929
for only 2.5 per cent,  of the total output  of steel;   the others being Mr. A.K.  McCosh of Sir William Baird and Companywho produce only oig iron, and Mr.  C.E.  Lloyd of messrs. N. Hingley and Sons who are chiefly concerned withwrought iron.  Mr. lloyd opposition was based in the mainon the absence of provision in the  scheme for compulsory powers.   There were two absentees  from the meeting who hadnet sent word of their attitude, one of whom v/as Sir JohnBeale of British (Guest, Keen and Baldwins) Iron and SteelCompany, with an output in 1929 of  about 5 per cent,  ofthe total.   Sir Joan Beale had opposed the scheme atearlier meetings as being premature, but was not present or represented at the final meeting.       It is stated in &quot;che covering memorandum that thescheme &quot;may perhaps more correctly  be described as a schemefor establishing the machinery whereby a reorganisation cfthe industry may be effected rather than as a scheme of reorganisation itself&quot;.   If by reorganisation is meant theactual alteration of the present distribution of productionamong the several units, the amalgamation of units, theimprovement of this plant and the elimination of that, thecontrol of prices, the pooling of effort in research,purchasing, marketing, etc., this statement is undoubtedlytrue, but progress in these several directions is bound to be slow without a strong central drive and adequate machinerythrough which it can operate.   So  much effort has beenexerted in the past and - in the absence af effective machinery to support it - with so little permanent result that it hasseemed advisable now to concentrate on the machinery.       It will be seen that the machinery contemplated in the scheme is of a comprehensive character, far more                          8.
comprehensive than anything which the industry has previouslyhad in mind.   Bearing in mind tine strong individualistictendencies hitherto prevalent in the industry, the keeninternal rivalry that has existed, in recent years, and therecurrent failures to secure any enduring basis of co-ooerationit is, we think, a notable achievement to have secured for it,even in general outline, so large a measure of support.       The questions for immediate consideration are two:-    (l) Is it designed to operate in the right directions?    (2) Will it operate effectively?       The needs of the industry in regard to reorganisationare many sided.  Owing probably to comparisons with the enormous units operating in America and on the Continentthe attention of reformers, especially those outside theindustry, has been concentrated in recent years on extensivephysical amalgamations almost to the exclusion of other aspects of the problem.   This tendency is strongly marked inthe admirable report on the industry prepared by Mr. BruceGardner in 1930.   But it was recognised in that report thatamalgamations, even if carried out to the fullest extentthere envisaged, would need to be supplemented by an effectivecentral organisation with extensive functions and considerable powers and also by special schemes dealing withparticular sections of trie industry.   The authors of thepresent plan do not dissent from the view that a large measure of consolidation of production in the more efficientunits, with the elimination of redundant plant, will benecessary, but they hold that physical amalgamation is notthe only means to this end.   The iron and steel industry ofthis country is not quite of the same mass productioncharacter as that of its rivals:  it is far more varied andspecialised, and care must be taken that in striving after
the advantages 01&apos; mass production we do not impair ourexceptional position as specialists.  If the right hind ofamalgamations are to be secured the process must be one of growth rather than of forcible imposition from above,  andmust inevitably, therefore, take time.  Meanwhile, the needsof the industry for avoiding uneconomic competition, forconcentrating production on the more efficient units,  for setting up a central control that will make sectional controleffective, for providing a national organisation capable of conducting negotiations with other industries and interests at home and competitors abroad, - all these needs and others are urgent.  Put in a nutshell, whereas Mr.  Gardner&apos;s report begins with amalgamation and relegates other action to a secondary position, this scheme reverses the order, trustingthat the processes set in operation under the scheme will lead inter alia to such amalgamations as are found by experience to be desirable.          In considering ho v.7 far these purposes are likelyto be attained it is important to remember that the scheme isframed oh a voluntary basis.  The only measure of compulsioncontemplated is such as can be applied by the industry itselfto its own members without statutory powers.  For this to be 1effective the proposed Corporation  must obviously command thesupport - indeed the whole-hearted  support - of the greatmajority of producers of pig iron and ingot  steel, and theseveral Associations, while loyally supporting the Corporation.,must themselves enjoy similar backing from their  own members.Opinion in the industry is still overwhelmingly againstinvoking compulsory powers from any external authority forthis purpose, though tho contrary view is gaining ground:indeed, the change  of outlook in the  last six months  in  regard
to reorganisation generally is remarkable.  The present schemewoulo. have had little chance of acceptance in September last.Even no-.v, some of the support accorded to it is ratherhalf-hearted, and many qualifications on points of detail -some of which may later prove to be points of substance - are recovered by the words &quot;general outline&quot; in the resolution of approval;  nevertheless, we are confident that support and indeed enthusiasm will steadily develop with the progress of negotiations, and we attach such importance to the industrytackling its own reorganisation that wc are anxious to give it the fullest opportunity therefor.          But there is no gainsaying the fact that the rateof progress will be greatly affected by the Government&apos;attitude to the scheme.  If the industry can be given clearlyto understand that the statement that a prosperous iron andsteel industry is vital to this country is no empty platitude,that if the industry fails to put its own house in order thealternative of Government action will be resolutely faced, butthat if on the other hand the industry presses on with, itsscheme it can rely on Government backing either to deal witha recalcitrant minority or to support it against the mostdetermined onslaught by a re-formed Continental steel cartel,then there is every prospect that the present apatheticacquiescence in some quarters, and even the small amount of opposition, will be won over to active support, and that theneed for Government intervention will never arise.           As a Committee, therefore, we recommend the schemeto the favourable consideration of the Government.  Subjectto any directions or assurances which the Government may feel able to give, we should propose in replying to the national committee to say that we regard the scheme as a satisfactorybeginning in the development of an effective organisation;
that it represents, of course, little more at present than an outline of proposed machinery and of the objects to be aimed at;  and that the energy and singlemindedxiess withwhich that machinery is set up and applied and those objectsare pursued must determine the Couimittee&apos;s attitude inregard to protective measures in future.  The Committee would propose to maintain their present intimate relations with theindustry and do all in their power to assist the progress ofthe scheme.          The scheme has already received a considerableamount of unauthorised publicity, and it is desirable thatit should be published officially at an early date.  on receiving the Government&apos;s decision we propose to reply tothe National Committee forthwith, and to issue that replytogether with Mr. Mitchell&apos;s letter and enclosures to thePress .   Public opinion can play a useful part in keeping the industry steadfastly along the path which it has nowplanned for itself.                            (Signed) G.E. MAY.24th March, 1955.
ENCLOSURES  III,NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR THE IRON &amp; STEEL INDUSTRY.Caxton House,   Tothill Street,      Westminster,  S.W.I.13th March, 1933.Sir George May, Bt.,Chairman,Import Duties Advisory Committee,Caxton House,Tothill Street, S.W.I.Dear Sir,          In our  first Report to you, dated 29th September,we stated that &quot;the industry has devised an organisation which is progressively working towards the nationalsolution of  its many  problems&quot;, but pointed out that progress was handicapped by the then tentative nature ofthe protective duties which were subject to review everythree months.   This  on the one hand encouraged the con-tinued consumption  of foreign material and the maintenanceof low price levels by competing countries in their deter-mination to retain  their market in this country, and onthe other hand, the same uncertainty handicapped the prospective expenditure of additional capital.          After receipt of this Report you were good enoughto attend a meeting of the National Executive Committee onOctober 10th at which the difficulties of the problem werefrankly discussed:  the Committee then gave you a definiteassurance that they would press on with the preparation ofa scheme.   This  assurance enabled you to recommend to the lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury that theduties should be  continued for a further period of not lessthan two years from the 26th October, 1932 &quot;subject to satisfactory progress being made in the preparation of thescheme of Reorganisation and in putting the approved scheme into force&quot;, and  in due course the Treasury made an Ordergiving effect to  this recommendation.          I have now  to report that after you had left themeeting of October 10th Sir William Larke and I were re-quested by the Committee forthwith to prepare a Memorandumon the future course  of procedure and were authorised to consult Sir Alfred Hurst who had been good enough to offer to assist the Committee, and I would like to say here how much we have valued the assistance we have received fromSir Alfred Hurst which,has been most useful and veryungrudgingly given.   in the preparation of the scheme wehave also been helped by discussions with the Chairmen ofthe four Regional Committees.          A Memorandum suggesting in broad outline  a schemeof reorganisation was first submitted to the national executive Committee on the 27th October .1932 and,  afteramendment in the course  of further discussions,  was sub-mitted to the National Committee on November 16th,  1932.The National Executive Committee,  after considering it,
passed the following resolution &apos;nemine contradicente&apos;:-          &quot;That the structure of the scheme he accepted           in principle and that the Sub-Committee           responsible for its preparation be requested           to draft this scheme in greater detail for the           consideration of the Executive Committee in           the first instance, and on approval by them,           the scheme to be submitted to this Committee           for approval or amendment before further           action is taken.&quot;          Following this resolution further consideration was given to the matter by the Sub-Committee and by theExecutive Committee and the scheme which I now enclose was recommended to the National Committee by a resolution passeby the National Executive Committee at its meeting held onFebruary 22nd in the following terms:-          &quot;That this scheme be referred to the National           Committee and recommended for acceptance by           them as providing machinery whereby the           progressive organisation of the industry may           be achieved. &quot;          The scheme was thereupon circulated to the thirtyfour members of the National Committee and a special meetingof the Committee was convened on the 10th March.   At that meeting after full discussion the following resolution was moved and carried by twenty-six votes to six:          &quot;This National Committee accepts the Memorandum           dated February 22nd and the general outline of           the scheme referred to therein, and directs that           it be forwarded forthwith to the Import Duties           Advisory Committee, together v/ith a statement           of the measure of support accorded to it by this           Committee, this action being in fulfilment of           the undertaking given by the National Executive           Committee on October 10th last to the Chairman           of the Import Duties Advisory Committee.&quot;          Of the six dissentients, three are makers offoundry pig iron who it is understood did not object to thescheme per se but considered that their interests were not sufficiently identified with those of the other producers of iron and steel to make it desirable that they should participate in the scheme.   Of the other dissentients,  one was a manufacturer of pig iron, one a wrought iron makerand the other a steel maker.          We trust that the Advisory Committee will agreethat the enclosed scheme should, subject to the maintenancecf protective duties at an effective level, provide satis-factorily for the progressive reorganisation of theindustry - a reorganisation which should enable it again totake its rightful place in the national economy, and in  so doing to make an increased contribution to national employ-ment.                        Yours faithfully,(Sgd.)   CHARLES MITCHELL.
Strictly Private  and Confidential.14th March, 1933.The  Reorganisation  of the  Iron and  Steel Industry.                                   I.  MEMORANDUM.    1.  At the meeting of representatives of the Iron and Steel Industry  with the Import  duties advisory Committee on the 3rd June, 1932, an undertaking was given on behalf of the industry inreturn for the grant of protection to prepare a scheme of reorganisation.   The assurance then givenwas categoricafly renewed by the Executive Committee  of the National Committee of the industry on the  10th October.  The scheme appended hereto has  been prepared in accordance with theresolution of the National  Committee at their meeting on  the 16th November, 1932.   In arriving at that resolution the National Committee recognised that the problems of the industry were far toocomplex and many sided to admit of any simple or immediate solution.  The scheme now presentedmay perhaps more correctly be described as a scheme  for establishing the machinery whereby are organisation of the industry may be  carried out rather than as a scheme of reorganisation itself and its ultimate  success will entirely depend upon  the vigour and single-mindedness with which that machinery is used.  It has purposely been  drawn on broad lines and with an elastic structure, soas to be readily adaptable to the constantly changing conditions of trade and industry.    2.  The case for a reorganisation of the British Iron and Steel Industry arises partly from thegeneral world situation in regard to production and consumption and partly from features peculiar to itself.  In few industries did the War period result in so large an expansion of world productivecapacity as  in the Iron and Steel Industry:  in few has the post-war period seen so marked a development of economic nationalism.  On the other hand, there has in  the last three years  beena great falling off in the world demand for iron and steel, and the prospects of an early return to thelevel of 1929 are  not encouraging.  Under such conditions it seems probable that the orderly progressof the industry can only  be secured by the  regulation of production in relation to demand both by international agreements and also, even  within the  protection of tariff walls, by applying some degreeof control to the individual producers of  each country.  The attached scheme aims first, therefore,at setting up an organisation in this country which will  have the power to negotiate such arrange-ments with  producers abroad, and will  be in a position to  apply the necessary degree of control athome to the benefit both of the industry  and of the nation  generally.    3.   But in regard to the British Iron and Steel Industry mere regulation of production in relationto demand will not alone suffice to place it in  a position to play its proper part in the national economy.The Iron and Steel Industry of this country reached maturity in the days of individualism and thecontinuance of free access to foreign supplies of raw and semi-manufactured materials  has resultedin its retaining much of its complex individualistic organisation long after its competitors in othercountries have become highly rationalised.  Such  a situation might be tolerable  in years of pros-perity, but  under conditions of surplus  production  the existence of many small, out-of-date, orinefficient plants  has handicapped others in keeping abreast of their competitors abroad.   A consider-able amount of leeway both in equipment and in organisation has, therefore, to be made up in various sections of the industry before its condition  can be considered to be thoroughly sound.    4.   If foreign analogies are to  be  trusted, further consolidation of the industry both by wayof horizontal groupings and vertical amalgamations will  be found desirable, but this process is necessarily difficult and lengthy and it is impossible to trust  to this course for an immediate, or evenultimately a complete, solution of present difficulties.   YAQiile leaving full scope for such consolidation,therefore, the scheme proceeds to seek a solution by co-operative action under which the interests ofthe industry are  safeguarded to the maximum possible extent, while it is  evolving an organisationadequate to present day needs.    5.   For this purpose it is proposed to adapt  and improve  on the existing machinciy of trade associations and  the National Federation of  Iron and Steel Manufacturers, grouping the Associations,which are at present mainly price maintenance bodies, into a smaller number of effective instrumentsfor the control of production in the  several  mam divisions of the industry, and giving a new central organisation the  power, which the Federation now lacks, to support and co-ordinate the activitiesof the Associations and to give effect to  the will of the industry in matters of general policy extendingbeyond the  sphere of any one Association.   It is  proposed to  mark this considerable developmentbeyond the  existing powers and functions of the  Federation by constituting the new  organisation&quot; The Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain.&quot;
    6.  It is believed that national interests, no less  than those of the industry itself, can best be served if  this matter of reorganisation is taken in hand  by the  industry  rather than by externalauthority and the scheme has been framed on this basis.   It is hoped that the scheme may be made effective without statutory power, but it must be  recognised that this  depends on its acceptanceultimately by the bulk of the industry.   Assuming  that at the outset all substantial producers of pigiron and ingot steel and a good majority of the manufacturers of secondary products join the proposedCorporation, it would be able to exert pressure on any opposing section by suitable rebate schemes.These might provide on the one hand for preferential prices for  supplies to members of the Corpora-tion and on the other bind purchasers by means of special rebates to take only products of the Cor-poration.   Should, however, the minority of the industry  standing out against the scheme prove tobe substantial, it would probably become necessary to seek statutory powers.    7.  An important  question arises at the outset as to what is to-be regarded as  the  Iron andSteel  Industry for the purpose of the scheme.  The ramifications of the  industry extend into everyphase of the national life and if the tariff on imported iron and steel is to be maintained at an effective-level, the Government and Parliament will  need to be assured that  the interests  of  consumers ofsteel are properly safeguarded.  For this purpose it is essential that the  Corporation, to which it isproposed  to entrust considerable  powers, should contain  a considerable  representation of the con-suming  interests.  This does not mean that all users of steel should be so  represented, including suchsubstantial  industries as shipbuilding, the railways or the motor  car industry.  Indeed, this wouldgive an  unnecessarily cumbrous structure besides introducing excessive diversity of interest.  perhaps the most convenient principle to follow would be to include all the main activities which are commonlyassociated with the manufacture  of  iron and steel.   The application of this principle results in areasonable balance of interest in  the Corporation and at  the same time brings within its purviewmost  of the difficulties arising from the competition of fully integrated plants with secondary pro-ducers purchasing semi-finished steel as their raw  mateiial.    S.  The wide range of interests so brought together  in the Corporation necessarily involves astrict limitation of its powers of interference with the affairs of separate  Associations and still morewith  the interests of  individual producers.  The general conception  underlying the scheme is thatthe respective Associations should be the responsible agents for securing the efficient working ofeach section of the industry,  being each autonomous in its own  sphere, and that  the functions ofthe Corporation should be generally of a stimulating and co-ordinating character.  In the  formercapacity it would bring to the assistance of each Association the  stimulus of the general opinion ofthe organised industry, backed by the co-operation of  other Associations, as and when required, andby the powerful instrument of a central fund collected by a levy  on the national production of pigiron and ingot steel.   As a co-ordinating body it  would use its influence  to secure that  mutuallyconsistent policies were followed by the several Associations, it would adjust differences between them,and in collaboration with them would take part in negotiations with outside interests.  The Corpora-tion acting alone would have no power of interference with the  rights  of  any individual producer.    9.  Probably one of the most important activities of  the Corporation would be that of guidingand moulding the evolution of the present fifty or so existing associations of very varying character and effectiveness into the smaller number of powerful production Associations envisaged under thescheme.   It is desirable that  the  number of associations should be kept as small as possible, con-sistently with reasonable homogeneity of interest (i) in order to increase their importance ;  (ii) tofacilitate a policy of interchange in production ;  and (iii) to secure  greater compactness and efficiency in the general organisation.  There is no reason why one Association should not comprise a numberof sections each dealing with a homogeneous group of products and co-ordinated by the main Associa-tion.  This would  undoubtedly be  necessary in the  case of the very  comprehensive Associationproposed for the imspecialised section of the steel  industry.  In order that this difficult process forming the new association may  be carried  through within a reasonable period and without  muchwaste of effort, it is proposed to constitute the Corporation at the outset, though  it must then ofcourse be on a somewhat provisional basis.   The representation of any  Association on the Councilof the Corporation would naturally come up for revision as each was  formally approved.    10.  This does not imply that the Corporation would be established during the initial periodalongside  the  Federation.  Such a course would only  lead to duplication and confusion.  The Cor-poration is intended to be the lineal descendant of the Federation, absorbing, as and when constituted,all the  existing functions and organisation of that body.   The  change over could not, however,in any event be made until the existing  members  of  the  Federation had decided by the necessary two-thirds majority vote, required under its constitution, on its dissolution.
II.  SCHEME OF  FUTURE ORGANISATION.     I.  General Organisation.  The British Iron and Steel  Industry shall be organised on the basisof a number of approved Associations, each dealing with a  group of similar products, and a central body co-ordinating Associations and incorporated either under Royal Charter or under the CompaniesAct, called the Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain.     2.  Membership.   All producers of iron and steel in the United  Kingdom, and all firms in theUnited Kingdom substantially engaged in the,manufacture of products-of any of the classes named in 6 (d)below, shall be entitled  to become ordinary members of their appropriate Associations and of theCorporation and  all necessary steps shall be taken to secure as soon as possible that the Corporationincludes all such  producers  of  iron and  steel and that the  respective Associations include all firmssubstantially engaged in each section of the industry.   With this end  in view all members of theCorporation shall  automatically become members of the Associations dealing  with  their respectiveproducts  when constituted  and approved.     3.  Functions. The  Corporation shall be  empowered        (a) to provide services of an  advisory character  for  the assistance  of its  members and             Associations, e.g., statistics, trade intelligence as to home and  foreign  markets and             transport facilities,  research  of all kinds, propaganda and guidance on employment,             financial, technical, transport, legal and other questions ;        (b) to promote  the  formation of approved Associations on the lines set out below and to             exercise such measure of supervision over them in matters of general policy and matters             affecting more  than one Association as is necessary to  secure the orderly progress of             the  industry;        (c) by agreement with approved Associations to provide, or assist in the provision of, services             of general  benefit to  their members, such as secretarial services, central purchasing,             common marketing, research, etc. ;        (d) to assist approved Associations in any measures  calculated to promote the  efficient             organisation of their respective sections of the industry including :             (i)  the promotion of desirable amalgamations  of existing undertakings and extensions                 and improvement of plant as and when required ;             (ii)  the prevention of unnecessary duplication of plant whether by existing  members                 of the  association or by other producers.        (e) to co-operate with approved Associations in promoting the export trade hi iron and steel;        (/) to adjust matters in dispute between Associations and to decide any question referred             to it under the rules of any  Association;        (g) to act on behalf of the industry  generally in collaboration, where appropriate, with             representatives of any Associations specially concerned in  all negotiations and other             proceedings with outside  interests, e.g., other industries,  transport authorities, the             Government, Parliament, foreign  Governments,  foreign industries, etc.     4.  Management of the  Corporation.  The  Corporation shah operate through an Annual GeneralMeeting, a Council, an Executive Committee and four Regional Committees, together with nationalAdvisory Committees for Wages, Transport, Research and other matters as may be found necessary.     5.  Annual General Meeting.   An Annual General Meeting, which all members of the corporation will be entitled to attend, shall be called by the Executive Committee.  The meeting shall receive anannual report and statement  of accounts from the CouncU and give such/iirections as may be necessary from time to time in regard to the general scope of the activities of the Corporation.     b.

(6) The Chairman of the British Iron and Steel Export  Association.         (c) The four Chairmen of the Regional Committees.         (d) Two other members elected by the ten representatives in G (d) above, one to retire every             two years but to be eligible for re-election.    9.  Regional Committees.  A Regional Committee, representative of interests comprised in  theCorporation shall be constituted for each of the four regions, to be elected b3&apos; members of the Cor-poration in the respective regions.   In order to secure the establishment of authoritative committees at the earliest possible moment, after the inception of the scheme, the first election shall be made by existing members of the Federation in the respective regions.   One-third of the members shall retireevery two years, but to be eligible for re-election.    10.  Functions of the  Regional Committees.

The  income of  the  Corporation shall  be derived in two ways:         (a) by an annual levy per  ton, payable by producers of pig iron and ingot steel under legal             agreement for a term of not less than ten years :  such agreement shall provide a maxi-             mum rate of levy for  each class of product within which limits the Council may levy             such a proportion as may from time to time prove necessary;         (b) by a levy on all members of the Corporation who do not produce pig iron or ingot steel             not exceeding 5/- per   100  wages paid per annum or by such other methods as may be             approved.    12.  Associations.  With a view to the avoidance of wasteful competition and the concentration of production in the more efficient units,  the industry shall be organised into a number of productionAssociations each comprising the manufacturers of a group of products.  The existing Associationsshall be combined, as soon as may be, into the following Associations to be approved under  Clause 13below:         1.  Pig Iron and  Ferro Alloys.         2.  Blooms, slabs, bdlets, plates, angles, sections,  joists,  sheet and tin plate bars, rails                and re-rolled products such as rods, bars, hoop and strip.         3.

The Minutes of the Meeting held on November16th, 1932, were confirmed and signed.          The Chairman extended  the hearty welcome of theCommittee to the new members recently appointed by the  ImportDuties Advisory Committee who were present for  the first time.19.  SCHEME OF ORGANISATION DATED 22nd FEBRUARY.   Beforeasking for observations on the scheme of organisation dated22nd February, which had been circulated, Mr. Mitchell  gave a brief review of the events leading up to the present  position,This resume is circulated with these Minutes.          Since the scheme was circulated the Committee res-pansible for the scheme desired  to introduce two slightmodifications which he would ask Sir Alfred Hurst to explain.Sir Alfred Hurst said that the first modification dealt withthe question of membership.   It was essential  that the scheme should have the backing of all individual producers of  ironand steel but it was not essential that all consumers shouldbe members of the Corporation as well as of their respectiveAssociations in their individual capacities.    It was there-fore proposed to modify clause II dealing with membershipso that the lines 7 and 8 at present reading        bothCorporation and Associations include as far as possible allfirms substantially ongaged in the industry ......&quot; should read &quot;to secure that the Corporation includes all such  pro-duco &apos;s of iron and steel as soon as possible  and that thorespuctive associations include all firms, substantially en-gagcd in each section of tho industry&quot;.   Linos 11 to 15 of clause II commoncing &quot;vice versa&quot; down to &quot;10 years&quot; shouldbe omitted.
6 (A          The second modification was in clause XI dealingwith income;  the opinion had been expressed that this clausewas not sufficiently elastic and that consideration mightshow that it was not necessary for all sections of the industryto contribute the same amount per ton to the levy which was togive the driving power to the.Corporation.   It had therefore been proposed that clause xrashould be modified to read asfollows:        by an annual levy per ton payable by producers of  pig iron and ingot steel under legal agreement for a  term of not less than ten years.   Such agreement shall  provide a maximum rate of levy for each class of product  within which limits the Council may levy such a proportion  as may from time to time prove necessary&quot;.This levy to be on the home production of ingot steel and of pig iron where not converted into steel.          Mr. Stobart asked whether it was essential that the levy contemplated under Clause XI(b) should be based on wagesand it was agreed that some other basis might be agreed forcertain sections of this industry, and it was therefore agreedto add to clause Xl(b) &quot;or by such other method as may be approved&quot; .          Capt. Hilton asked whether the alterations suggestedby the Regional Committees had been considered, but Mr. Mitchellexplained that the matter had not been referred to regional commitees for detailed consideration at this stageB   Copiesof the scheme had only been sent so that the Regional Committeescould discuss the scheme with their chairmen.   If the MidlandsRegional Committee wished any major point of principle discussedhe would be glad if Capt. Hilton would bring it forward.Capt. Hilton said that there was some doubt in the minds of theMidlands Regional Committee whether membership of the exportassociation was compulsory under the scheme or not;  itwas pointed out that by clause XIV all the associations wereeligible for membership of the British Iron and Steel ExportAssociation or Company but that it was not compulsory on anyassociation to join.   Capt. Hilton said that most of theother points were not matters of principle and if it was under-stood that full consideration would be given to them at a later stage he would not raise them on this occasion.   The chairmanstated that it was quite understood that the door was notclosed to subsequent modification of details of the scheme.He hoped that the Committee would confine itself to considerationof the general outline of the scheme.          Mr. Fox stated that the makers of foundry and forgopig iron desired to be excluded from the scheme.   The schemewas primarily one for the steel industry and in no way concerned the makers of forgo and foundry pig iron.   Yi/whatever they (thefoundry and forge makers) did could neither help nor injure the steel industry and if the foundry pig iron makers contributed to a levy towards the operation of the scheme they were in factcontributing towards their competitors.   Ono of the primaryfunctions of the Corporation would be propaganda on behalf ofthe heavy steel industry, and while anxious to support any scheme for the re-organisation of the industry ho felt theycould hardly be oxpectod to contribute towards propaganda ontheir competitors&apos; behalf.   Ho pointed out that the pig ironindustry was now organised to practically 100 per oent in a
national organisation.   As far as he personally was con-cerned he had no need for any tariff protection for pigiron.          Mr. Turner supported Mr. Fox&apos; views and statedthat the matter had been raised at the meeting of theMidlands Regional Committee and had the sympathy of that committee.   It appeared to him that the scheme had beenprepared for the steel trade and that foundry pig ironmakers had nothing whatever to do with the steel trade.If the scheme were put before the pig iron associationshe was quite sure they would refuse to join the proposedCorporation.          Mr. George pointed out that it was possible forother producers of pig iron to interfere with tho class of pig iron to which Mr. Fox referred and that his interests would be better safeguarded by becoming a member of theCorporation.               t          Mr. Mc-^uistan pointed out that some furnacos pro-duced alternatively foundry and basic and for foundry ironto be contracted out of tho scheme would make it very com-plicated.          Capt. Hilton thought that when the words &quot;iron andsteel&quot; were used most members thought of the iron which wasto be eventually converted into steel and ho agreed that thefoundry trade had no connection, as a trade, with the steel trade and that the scheme might be complicated by bringing in makers of foundry and forge pig iron.          Sir V/illiam Larkc suggested that it would bo opento the foundry makers to join as an association without boingrequired to join individually and Mr. Turner stated that ifthe question of joining was allowed to remain voluntary itwould probably meet the case.          Mr. Georgo pointed cut that there was no element of compulsion in the scheme whatever and no firm or associa-tion was compelled to join.          Sir Alfred Hurst stated that the points just raisedby Mr. Fox and others were the reason for altering the clausedealing with the basis of levy so that whore the tonnage basiswas inequitable, or where it was agreed the services of theCorporation were not so valuable to a certain section as to others, the basis or rate of levy might bo modified.   Thefact that foundry pig iron makers were in fact members of theFederation suggested that they found some of the servicesworth while and the connection between the foundry ironindustry and the steel industry was hardly as remote as suggested by Mr. Turner.   It was very undesirable that thofoundry makers should bo cut off from tho Corporation al-together but membership of the Corporation might be leftvoluntary.          Mr. Turner pointed out that on tho wholo it wouldbe bettor to leave tho foundry makers out of the scheme.fie did not see why tho policy of the foundry iron trade should come under tho review of a committee dominated by steelproducers;  rather than the foundry iron industry shouldbe taxed for the benefit of tho stool industry he would be willing to see the duties taken off pig iron.
          Mr. George emphasised that there was nothing in thescheme to compel the foundry makers to join but he deprecatedmaking provision in the scheme for any specific exclusions.          Mr. Turner asked that his protest against theinclusion of the foundry trade in the scheme be registered.          Mr. Lysaght asked whether it was proposed to formthe Associations before the Corporation and Sir Alfred Hurstreplied that the Corporation must come first since it wouldbe looked to to give powerful aid towards perfecting theexisting associations and forming new ones.          Mr. McCosh stated that the scheme under consideration was not a scheme for re-organisation but for the setting up ofa further body to complete a scheme and car^ it out.   In his view the element of compulsion was inherent in the scheme:  itwas no use ignoring the fact that the interests of various sections were divergent and it appeared to him that the scheme proposed to put all the various sections under the domination of the heavy steel industry.   The scheme could never work without goodwill and it was absolutely necessary that eachsection should feel that it Tras getting a fair deal.   Inhis opinion we were attempting to go too fast and it wouldhave been far better that the scheme should have been built up from the Regional Committees and the Associations.   Thiswould have given confidence that the scheme would operatefairly as between the various areas and sections concerned:he would be obliged to oppose the scheme.          Major Hibbert stated that in order to be successfulthe scheme must have 100 per cent support from all the associations.   In his opinion it was loaded against the pigiron manufacturers.   He agreed that it would have been better for the Corporation to have built up from the associations.          Sir Alfred Hurst replied that all associations re-quired backing up from other associations.   Many of the associations were at present ineffective and it was absolutely essential to have some co-ordinating and driving force.          Mr. C. Lloyd complained that the scheme avoided allthe thorny questions and did not give all the help which sir alfred Hurst claimed for it.   The only help which theCorporation could give to the associations was by moralsuasion.   Was anyone going to be prevented from extendinghis plant or anyone prevented from setting up a new plantmerely by moral suasion.   It might be said that control could be obtained by withholding supplies or by securing the adherence of consumers to members of the Corporation by meansof a rebate scheme but he called this intrigue.   The schemewas not. democratic;  it was imposed from above and hesympathised with the suggestion of Mr. McCosh that it be re-mitted to the associations and Regional Committees for theirviews.   In his opinion an element of compulsion was essential and compulsory powers could be obtained from the Government asthey already existed in tho coal trade, they were about tobe applied in transport, and the cotton industry had been offered them.          Sir Alfred Hurst asked whether industry reallywanted to ask the Government to impose control from without.He thought that the consensus of opinion was against it and
the scheme had tried to take another line of approach.  it looked to the trade to provide its own p.*wer to carry out its own scheme and by means of its control of supplies andsystem of rebates to consumers it could certainly controlwasteful competition.    He agreed that the only alternative to the industry carrying out its own scheme was to apply tothe Government for compulsory powers.     He reminded theCommittee that the report of the Import Duties AdvisoryCommittee had agreed that &quot;a prosperous iron and steelindustry is essential.&quot;     He asked  &quot;Is it prosperous?&quot;Having declared that an efficient and prosperous iron andsteel industry was essential to the country people outsidethe industry were obliged to see that the country possessedsuch an industry and would endeavour to secure it if theindustry, in its own interests, did not organise itself tosecure it.          In order to test the feeling of the meeting, L&apos;Ir.George then proposed the following resolution:-        &quot;This National Committee accepts the Memorandum      dated February 22nd and the Scheme referred to      therein, and directs that it be forwarded forth-      with to the Import Duties Advisory Committee,  to-      gether with a statement of the measure of support      accorded to it by this Committee, this action being      in fulfilment of the undertaking given by the      Executive Committee on October 10th last to the      Chairman of the Import Duties Advisory Committee.&quot;Mr. George stated that the committee had worked for several months on the scheme and most of them felt that they did not want compulsion.    Tho re-organisation of the trade couldonly be brought about by one of two methods, that is, eithervoluntarily or compulsorily.  He did not see how the committee could go to Parliament for compulsory powers for this would necessarily involve the active participation of labour in theindustry and possibly the statutory fixing of wages.   Thescheme included the least possible element of compulsion andin his opinion was the least that could be put up to aGovernment department and he thought the Committee would dowell to accept it.   It was hoped that the Corporation would bring the associations into effective operation and be power-ful .enough to prevent the evasion which had been characteris-tic of many existing associations.          Capt. Hilton supported Mr. George and stated thatto refer the&quot;matter back at this stage would be a retrograde step.    The past twelve months had been a testing time inthe history of the associations and it must be agreed thatthe experience had not been satisfactory; ho was sure thatif the scheme were in operation all associations would be assisted.          Mr. Lysaght asked if the associations had had anopportunity of discussing the scheme and the chairman replied
-chat it had not been referred to the associations  although many members of associations had had an opportunity of  studying thescheme in their individual capacities.       capt. Read stated that at a meeting of the  Re-RollersNational Committee held the previous day the scheme was  approved in principle but the Committee wished to reserve the rightto suggest modifications in various directions at  a later date.A committee of the Re-Rollers, in conjunction with the SteelMakers, had drafted a scheme for co-operation in the controlof prices of semi-finished and finished material but they feltthat progress in this matter was painfully slow and hopedthat the adoption of the scheme now being considered would facilitate arrangements of this kind.   At present  the re-rollersfelt that they were at the mercy of the steel makers and thefact could not be ignored that many of  them felt they werenot having a fair deal.  It was pointed out for instance thatsteel makers left too little margin between the price of billetand the price of the finished material  and many complaints hadbeen received that the steel makers were undercutting the re-rollers.  He hoped that the present scheme would be accepted andthat it would assist in the formation of associations such asthe re-rollers desired but if much further delay occurred inconcluding the arrangements at -present  under negotiation betweenthe steel makers and re--?ollers he feared that the re-rollerswould have to reconsider their attitude.       Mr. ITalliday, as a representative of the fabricated  steelindustry, recognised the need that each association had  for help from a central corporation.  The position in  some of them was so complicated and difficult that it was impossible  to goon unless some such scheme as that outlined were put into effect.He thought that more weight should be given to the constructionalsteel makers in the representation.  He also thought there  shouldbe direct representation of constructional engineers on  the regional Committees and that on the Executive Committee  thereshould be at least four members voyresenting consumers.  As far -as the fabricating industry was concerned little headway wouldbe made without the help and. force given in the scheme and hego.ve it his support.       Sir Harris Spencer wished to help in the reorganisationas far as was compatible with the interests of the consumersand reminded the Committee that -Mr G-eorge May had said  thatthe interests of the consumers v&amp;a&amp;h ho looked after: up  to thepresent he had soon little signs oi this.  Prices  had risen to the detriment of tho export traae end while the scheme seemedwell conceived, and the authors      to be thanked and congrat-ulatod on a good pioco of work, ho iaust ask what the stoelindustry was going to do to r.s^:!.s5 consumers in tho exporttrade.  The logical, way to assist wan by means of  a drawbackand if it was suggested that tho same end could be achieved by subsidies through a general fund h* could not agree. Importedsteel was not being replaced by homo produced stoel and  theeffect of tho tariff.-, had boon to increase prices.  Tho  mostimportant function mentioned in clause&apos; Xlll was that doalingwith the prevention of wasteful compotit:&apos; on and ,he was preparedto assist in tho reorganisation or  oho associations with whichho was connected as noon as it won clear that this function oftho Corporation was to bo vigorously proceeded with.       Mr, Frank Roes thought chat in spite of tho resolution which had boon passed by the Sbutli Hales Regional  Committee afew days ago South Wales members oouia support Mr. George&apos;a.
resolution if it wore slightly modified and ho  hoped Mr,  Georgewould agree to modify it slightly so that  South Wales  could accept it.       Sir William Larke, as a joint author of  the  scheme,thought that it could not be far out when  it  was criticised by Mr, Lloyd on the one hand for not going for  enough  and byMr. McCosh on the other as going too far.   He reminded thecommittee that as a spokesman for the industry  in interviews with the Government and others he had always repudiated thesuggestion that it would be necessary to organise the  industry on some such lines c.s that of the Electricity Board or theBritish Broadcasting Company.   He had always maintained that theiron and steel makers were capable of managing  their own  affairs.All would agree that a prosperous and efficient industry  wasa fsine qua non* for the nation and the problem of  putting theindustry on that basis was now one of urgency.   The recent negotiations of the Continent to renew the International  SteelCartol was an additional ground of urgency.   Every  one of o\rccompetitors no-.: had a national organisation in  a fair  way tobecoming effective.  The Cartel intended to concentrate itsattention on the export trade.   This would doubtless soon involveorganised competition against this country in all markets ofthe world and if the Cartel succeeded in its efforts the  positionof the industry in this country would be exceedingly difficult.We could not meet organised competition on the  basis of individualunits.  Full consideration had been given  to the suggestion thattho now Corporation should bo built up from the trade  associations and with regional representation but as the question was  studiedit became clearer that it was essential to provide  a centrefrom which it would bo possible to help each of the associationsto tighten up its organisation and to afford mutual support foreach other.  He hoped the scheme would facilitate the  completeorganisation in export markets.   He thought that the export sideof the industry should be so organised that all products  couldbe effectively represented in c.11 the markets of the world.  Ifthe present scheme wore not accepted the only alternative, asfar as he could sec, ./as that the C-government  would  set up anotherCommittee which would be far less sympathetic to the industryand might report in favour of the formation of  the  organisationof the industry as a utility undertaking and the position ofthe industry would bo rendered hopeless.       The resolution of the South Wales Regional Committeewas then read to the meeting but it was pointed out that  thescheme had only been referred to Regional  Committees forinformation and comment.       Sir Alfred Hurst stated that he had been associatedwith the work of the commit toe for the past five months and had very much enjoyed tho contacts he had established and  thefriendships he had made.  He had found the work very interestingand had been received sympathetically in all quarters.  He had a&apos;suspicion, however, that amongst those he  had not met  personally,there was a feeling that he was tho nominee of  the  Government onthe Committee and that he was acting under Government  instructions.He wished to dispel any such illusion and  to state  categoricallythat ho had received no instructions from  Sir George May, thePresident of the Board of Trade, or anyone else in  authority.The only hint ho had received was one from the  Chancellor ofthe Exchequer that it would be inadvisable for  him  to  take the chair at any meetings of tho industry as this night easily be misinterpreted as Government ink orf or once.  He  had  certainlybeen omphatio in expressing his convictions because they  weregenuine conviotions.  Ho agrood that it was absolutely essential
Mr. Goorgo&apos;s resolution amended as follows:that the Corporation should have an independent chairman.From his reading of the position it seemed probable  that  thomajority of the committee would accept the scheme.   If so he hoped that thoy would make tho vote unanimous for it would bomost unfortunate if it should have to be admitted that thescheme came from a divided industry,   he would therefore suggest that if on a first vote there was a majority in favourof the scheme the committee would consider the advisability of taking a further vote on which the support could DO  madeunanimous.  He was not exaggerating when he said that  manyindustries were looking to the iron and stool industry to givea load and that their competitors on the Continent were watchingdevelopments perhaps with a certain amount of cynicism butcertainly with some measure of anxiety lost tho British industry should rise to this groat opportunity.  Pie sincerely hoped itwould.       Mr. Frank Hoos stated that with slight modificationhe thought it would bo possible for him to support the schemeand after some discussion Mr. C-eorge accepted tho suggestion to incorporate in his resolution the words &quot;the general outline of tho scheme.5&apos;       Mr. A.&apos;;&quot;.. McCosh stated that it was no use ignoring thefact that tho industry was divided about tho scheme  and littlegood would be done by attempting to find a more or less inocuousformula on which all could agree.       Colonel Neil son asked with whom the po\mr of  makingthe levy rested and the reply was that the levy would be  fixed by agreement among tho producers: he could not support the .resolution without reservation regarding the levy.   Mr. C-eorgestated that tho inclusion of the words &quot;general outline11  inthe resolution covered Colonel Noilson&apos;s reservation.       Mr. Craig asked what was the alternative of those  whowere not in favour of the scheme: presumably the alternative was to apply for statutory powers.  If that wore the case wouldnot one of the members opposed to the scheme put this alternativein the form of an amendment.       Mr. A.&quot;I. McCosh declined to put an amendment  in this form but pointed out that in any Government scheme there  would at least be safeguards for tho rights of minorities  which werenot provided for in tho present scheme.       Mr. Kayser referred to tho question of levy and statedthat a levy based on wages would operate inequitably in thospecial steel trade and while supporting the scheme  in principlehe must reserve the right of the members of the special qualitysteol industry to suggest variations in the basis of levy.Further, he thought the period of ten years suggested was too long and would like further consideration given to this point.The chairman again confirmed that ample opportunity  would be given , subsequently for further consideration of these points.He was concerned at the moment to obtain acceptance  of theprinciples of the scheme.
  &quot;This National Commit toe accepts the Memorandumdated February 2End and the general outline of thescheme referred to therein, and directs that it be forwarded forthwith to the Import Duties AdvisoryCommittee, together with a statement of the measureof support accorded to it by this Committee, this action being in fulfilment of the undertaking givenby the Executive Committee on October 10th last tothe Chairman of the Import Duties Advisory Committee.&quot;was then again reed to the meeting and carried by twenty-fivevotes to five dissentients, being Messrs.  E.  J. Fox,  W.  Gray,C. E. Lloyd, A. K. McCosh and D. N. Turner.   Messrs. Fox andTurner intimated that their opposition was onlv directed tosecure the&quot; exclusion of the foundry pig iron industry.   Theydid not object to the proposed scheme as one  for the  reorganisation -sation of the steel industry.    The Chairman stated  that hehad messages from Sir William Firth supporting the scheme andfrom Mr. G. H. Johnson opposing it.20.  CIRCULATION OF THE SCHEME.     The Committee authorised the circulation of the scheme to members of those associationswho, it was hoped, would form the membership of the Corpora-tion.   The scheme having been accepted by the Committee would at this stage be sent for information only.    It should con-tinue to be treated as confidential and not for publication.The scheme, as modified, should forthwith be submitted to theImport Duties Advisory Committee and when their views on thescheme had been obtained a further meeting of the Committeewould be called to consider them.

MITCHELL, CHAIRMAN, AT A MEETING OF THE       NATIONAL COMMITTEE ON FRIDAY, MARCH 10th, 1955.          The deliberations of this Committee have now reachedthe conclusion of a definite stage, and it may be well to re-mind the members, and particularly those who have only re-cently been appointed to this Committee - (whose appointmentwe welcome as representing in a large degree the consumingtrades, with whom we must establish the closest co-operation in our mutual interests) - of the genesis of the Committeeand the Scheme which is submitted for your consideration thismorning.          On 3rd June 1952, a meeting of representatives ofthe iron and steel industry was called by Sir George May, as chairman of the Import Duties Advisory Committee, and at that meeting Sir George May announced tho intention of that committee to appoint a committee of the industry to consider what form of organisation could be applied to the industryv/hich  vrould implement the promises which had beon made on be-half of tho industry by its leaders at various times to ministers and representative Committees of the Cabinet andthe various Govurnment Committees that have been appointedto consider the problems of the industry.          The question has sometimes boon asked why conditions should be attached to tho granting of protection which wasnecessary to secure the survival of the industry;  but pro-tection could only be granted with tho consent of Parliamentendorsed by public opinion, and since this was a basic industry on which it may be broadly stated that all other industriesultimately depend, and consequently a large proportion of our export trade, and since it also affects materially the inter-ests of the individual consumer in the home market, it was recognised that tho industry must be in a position to give assurances that the application of protection would result in national advantage.         While this National Committee was in fact appointed bythe Import Duties Advisory Committee in discharge of its res-ponsibility to consider the public interest in any advice itmight  tender to His Majesty&apos;s Government, it will be agreedthat had the industry appointed the Committee it must havebeen constituted of the same personnel.          On 7th June 1932, four days after appointment, theNational Committee mot, and elected an Executive Committee and four Regional Committees.   Terms of Reference were approvedby the National Committee on 20th July.          On 28th September, a Report was presented to thisCommittee and approved  to be forwarded to the Import duties advisory Committee, and this Report, it will bo remembered, was presented as a supplement to the Report of the Import Duties
9 0 0Ay tJ OAdvisory Committee to the Treasury recommending that the duties on iron and steel products should be extended for a period oftwo years as from October 26th.          On October 10th, at a meeting of the National Exe-executive Committee, Sir George May was present, when it waspointed out to him that the Continent was still sending steelinto this market, the chief reason for which was the uncertainty as to the period for which the Duties would be applied.          Sir George May urged the industry to make some pro-posals on a Scheme embodying national organisation, but he wasdesirous that the industry should propound its own Scheme;and while recognising to the full the difficulties of the Com-mittee, he asked for an assurance that the National Committeewould immediately take steps to devise such a scheme.   On thissame date (October 10th) the Committee unanimously gave sir george May an assurance that they would proceed with the pre-paration of such a scheme without delay.          I was asked, with Sir William Larke, to prepare ashort Memorandum sketching the outline of such a scheme.  It wassuggested that Sir Alfred Hurst should be consulted , as he was willing to lend any assistance he might be able to render inorder that the Import Duties Advisory Committee might be fully aware of both the difficulties and the progress that was beingmade by the Committee.          On November 16th a Memorandum, which had previously been adopted by the Executive Committee without dissent, was submitted to this National Committee and adopted in the follow-ing terms:   &quot;That the structure of the Scheme *e accepted inprinciple and that the Sub-Committee responsible for its pre-paration be requested to draft this Scheme in greater detailfor the consideration of the Executive Committee in the firstinstance, and on approval by them the Scheme to be submittedto the National Committee for approval or amendment beforefurther action is taken&quot;.          Without referring in detail to the intermediate stages,the Scheme as now submitted to you was submitted to theExecutive Committee on February 1st, after which amendments were embodied as a result of the discussion, and at a further meeting on February 22nd, when it was referred to this Committee,with three dissentients, in the following terms:  &quot;That thisScheme be referred to the National Committee, and recommended for acceptance by them, as providing machinery whereby the progressive organisation of the industry may be achieved.&quot;          I would emphasise the terms of that Resolution asbeing a terse but very adequate description of the Schemewhich you are now asked to consider.   It does not in any wayembody a principle of control imposed from above on any sectionor individual of tho industry, but it is designed to provide an organisation within which, by progressive evolution, under theconditions obtaining, an ever-increasing degree of organisedcontrol over the operations of the industry may be exercised by those engaged in and responsible for it.   It is on thosegrounds that the Schorao is commended to you for, if possible,your unanimous adoption, either in its present or some agreedamended form.
          The importance of unanimity in a matter of this kindcannot be exaggerated, since to render any such Scheme effec-tive it is essential to have not only a general acceptance ofits principles but a willingness to approach all difficultiesin connection with its realisation with a determination to overcome them and render the scheme successful.          So far, no alternative has been suggested to a Schemecf this character, which now embodies the greatest common mea-sure of constructive criticism which would retain the principles which were unanimously accepted in the first instance as thebasis for the Scheme.    While we - least of all the Sub-Commit-tee who were responsible for the original draft - could lay no claim to having provided for every possible contingency thatmight arise, or for perfection in the Scheme itself, as practi-cal men we must realise that in our own organisations and inthe decisions we daily take, it is impossible for us to do morethan exercise our judgment on the conditions under which we are working to the best of our ability and to accept the risk in-volved.     But in the case of this Scheme before you the riskhas been reduced to a minimum since what you are asked to do isto provide a Central Organisation round which the organisationof the industry can progressively proceed by sections, eachsection retaining almost complete autonomy, as indeed does each individual works, except that it is asked to conform to anational policy in regard to production, and sales.    But thispolicy will be devised by yourselves, and is nnly an extensionof what has been common practice in many sections of the indus-try for many years; except that I should point out that asso-ciations must be more effective and certainly more stable thanthey have been in recent times, which implies that agreements to co-operate in the several spheres of our activity must befor a substantial period of time, to prevent tho disturbancewhich the existence of agreements for short periods inevitablyintroduces, since they are no sooner signed than discussionsarise as to their modification or extension.          On the subject of amalgamations, which many of usbelieve to be in the best interests of the industry as a wholewhere economic advantage can be demonstrated as a result, itis claimed that this Scheme provides conditions in which atnal-gamations will be facilitated wherever conditions render themdesirable.     In the case of plant which by the natural evo-lution of new processes or commercial competition may becomeredundant, or at a relative disadvantage, the Schema provides the means whereby the industry could deal, by compensation,purchase or otherwise, with any such condition that might arise in any port or section of the industry, always on theunderstanding that these movements are with the consent of theparties interested or concerned.    Indeed, the Scheme hasbean devised to secure to the industry indefinitely for thefuture the complete control of its own policy and destinies.          Tho alternative is inevitably tho introduction of external interference and a greater or less measure of exter-nal control, such as has already been experienced in the coalindustry, and which you will note has been voiced in connectionwith this industry.  This industry is essential to our national industrial economy, and n* Government, whatever its politicalcomplexion, can afford to allow it t* languish to a point where
it ceases to satisfy adequately our national needs.  Onlythis last week the Deputy Chairman of the  Labour Party  statedthat if returned to power they would organise the  iron  andsteel industry on national lines.      The present Government  are desirous  of avoiding anyexternal interference and have urged the industry  to rendereven the suggestion of it unnecessary by demonstrating  its capacity to manage its own affairs and organise itself  on anational basis so as to strengthen its competitive power inthe export markets of the world and to secure to the homeconsumer, in the words of Sir George May,  :,&apos;the right materialat the right price.&quot;      I therefore urge the unanimous acceptance of this scheme,with all the shortcomings which it  may possess, since it pro-vides the means, by progressive development, for ensuring tothe industry a form, of organisation which,  as I believe, willstrengthen its competitive power in relation to the rest ofthe world, and a substantial  improvement in its present economic position in the near future and a return to complete prosperitywhen general world conditions permit.      The alternative is a continuance of  present  conditions,tending towards financial collapse and certainly to a condition which no Government would tolerate without  making  an attempt&apos;to save the situation.  This  would involve far greater  diffi-culties on the part of those  responsible for the direction and control of the industry than any measures which it  is nowproposed they should tako at  their own unfettered  discretion.      Time has presented the  opportunity.   Are we  going tosieze it or allow it to go by default?  I  am confident  thatthere is no-one outside the industry who is so competent tocontrol and direct its destinies as those  who have been responsible for its progress and condxict heretofore, and I thereforecommend this scheme to you for your unanimous approval, inorder that we may restore confidence within and without theindustry in its future, and possibly set an example to  other -industries which will stimulate industrial recovery throughoutthis country to our own lasting benefit.
