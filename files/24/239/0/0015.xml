J)00UMEHT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT.65 (53)COPY NO.CABINET.              The Argentine negotiations and Meat.          Note &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.     I circulate herewith to my colleagues a memorandum on  thepresent state of the Commercial Negotiations with Argentina.     The first object of these negotiations is to secure some arrangement for the allocation of adequate supplies  of  exchangein future to the British firms and companies trading with oroperating in Argentina which are facing great difficulties  owingto the fact that their resources in the Argentina amounting tono less than ten millions sterling, are at present &quot;frozen&quot; inthat country and cannot be remitted to the United Kingdom.     In addition I hope to secure favourable changes in thelevel and classifications of the Argentine Customs Tariff.     The possibility of securing concessions on either  of these points depends, however, entirely on our heing in a  position togive adequate security as to the future of the Argentine exporttrade in chilled beef to this country, and, as indicated in thememorandum, I feel it necessary to ask for authority to offer to guarantee to the Argentines that in the next three years any temporary reduction in the amount of chilled beef allowed to be imported into this country which may be required to  maintainprices at a remunerative level shall not in any one  year exceed10 per cent, of the imports from Argentina in the standard  Ottawaperiod, i.e. the twelve months ended June 30th, 1932.W.R.Board of Trade,   14th March,  1933.
          THE ARfli55TTJ3  JEGOTIATIOflS AMD ifflEAT.   1,  The trade negotiations with the Argentine Mission,whioh began in a very favourable atmosphere, have now reached a crucial stage.   2. Our principal objects in these negotiations are tosecure a satisfactory arrangement in regard to exchange restrictions and to obtain reductions of the import duties on goods of particular interest to our exporting industries,especially the textile industries.  The Argentines fortheir part wish to secure guarantees as to the futuretreatment in the United Kingdom of the main classes of goodsthey sond us and they attach over-riding importance tochilled beef.   3. As regards exchange restrictions, we are attempting toobtain in the first place an arrangement for dealing withthe &quot;frozen&quot; pesos of British firms trading with theArgentine and of the British railway and other companiescarrying on business in the Argentine, and, secondly, an assurance that sufficient foreign exchange will be madeavailable in future to meet the current requirements of the3ritish traders and companies.  The amount of money owingto British firms and companies which is now &quot;frozen&quot; inthe Argentine amounts to no less than 10 millions sterling and discussions as to the method of releasing these sumshave now reached an advanced stage.  The Argentine Missionhave accepted the principle that the available foreign exchange (after deducting the amounts required for theservice of the Argentine public debt) should be allocated to British claims in the same proportion as the Argentineexports to the United Kingdom bear to their total exports;and though there are difficulties in reconciling the figures
of exchange available with,  our requirements substantial progress has been made in working out a scheme for thesettlement of the &quot;frozen&quot; pesos, by-the payment in cashof the smaller claims and by the conversion into sterlingbonds of the larger claims.   4. Turning to the import duties imposed in Argentina inBritish goods the Argentinea will probably not he able togive us actual tariff preferences o/er similar foreign goodsbecause they are at present bound by  their own treaties togive full most-favoured-nation treatment to certain foreigncountries and, if they free themselves from these treaties and give less favourable tariff treatment to the goods ofour foreign competitors than to our goods, they may berisking tariff wars with countries which, in the aggregate,take over 60^ of their exports,  They have, however,indicated that as part of a satisfactory general settlementthey would be prepared to make substantial reductions inthe duties on goods, notably textiles, which they importmainly from us and also that they would be prepared tomake changes in their Tariff classification with a view tobenefiting   our trade at the expense of that of foreigncountries.    There can be no doubt that the prospects ofour export trade to the Argentine would be much improvedif we are able to secure tariff reductions and re-classifications on the lines which have been discussed andan assurance that sufficient foreign  exchange will be madeavailable in future to meet our requirements.   5.  While the Argentine Mission have from the firstshown themselves sympathetic towards  our desiderata, theyhave taken pains to make it clear that it is essential forthem to secure satisfactory guarantees as to our futuretreatment of the goods they send us and particularly ofchilled beef.
   6. The exportation of chilled beef to this countryio a major interest of Argentina.  Though the quantityhas been reduced in recent years from nearly 10 millioncwt. in 1027 to 7.7 million cwt. in the Gr*tawa basicperiod (July 1931 to June 1932) it is still one of theessential elements of her economic life, accounting for nearly 15 per cent, of her total export trado and one thirdof our total  imports from Argentina,  moreover apart fromits economic importance Argentina attaches special politicaland sentimental importance to safeguarding her export ofchilled beef to this country.  Accordingly the news thatthe Ottawa Agreements merely stabilised the existing totaland did not provide for any reduction was received by the argentines-with great relief.   Unfortunately it has been necessary, in. order to prevent a serious fall of meat.prices, to reduce this total by 10 per cent, in recent months by arrangement with the importers, and the situationis clearly such that we should retain the right to make further reductions of this order when necessary.   the argentines, however, will certainly require that some limit should be placed on future possible reductions even though they are admittedly effected in order to maintain prices.   7. Apart from the maintenance of the total volume oftrade, they are very anxious that we should modify our existing licensing system so as to allow of importationsfrom publicly owned frigorificos which they wish to setup as in their opinion the only means by which they oansatisfy themselves that reasonable prices are being paidto their estancieros,.  Public animosity against the foreignowned frigorifico i3 a recurrent phenomenon in Argentina,and the feeling appears to have been exasperated by thefact that, for sufficient reasons, we have issued import
licences only to the firms at present engaged in the trade.   8;  It will he very difficult to meet the views of the delegation in such a way as to enable them to convince their nationals that they have obtained satisfactory concessions fromU3.   The present position is that we have offered not to restrict Imports of chilled beef from Argentina below the ottawa total except in so far as it may be necessary toprevent prices from falling to unremunerative levels, and toissue licences in respect of importations from publicly ownedfrigorifico3 up to 10 per cent, of the total trade If, after an enquiry in which His Ida jest y&apos;s Government would participate,the Argentine Government are satisfied that it i3 only in thisway that they can assure to their producers a fair share ofthe realised price.  This offer was made a week ago but the delegation have made it clear that this does not give themidequate  guarantees in regard to the future of their trade,and they have in fact replied by a very unfavourable changein their attitude towards our proposals with regard to exchange.   9. If pressed, as we certainly shall be to limit thepossible reduction of chilled meat imports, I ask for* theauthority of the Cabinet to offer to limit the reduction toa maximum of 10 per cent, over the year provided that inreturn we can obtain satisfaction of what we consider ourlegitimate claims on the other heads of the negotiation(exchange allocations and Argentine tariffs).  This limitationwill allow for a larger reduction In some seasons and a smallerin others.  I appreciate that we must always bear in mind the possibility of a serious collapse of the meat market.Such a situation could I think only be dealt with byunfettered consultation between the Governments concerned
and I do not think that we can provide for this byany figures in the Argentine Treaty.   To press upon the delegation a higher figure than 10 per cent, would, in myopinion only imperil the whole negotiations on what mustbe a more speculation.                                               W.R.Board of Trade,     14th liarch,  1935.
