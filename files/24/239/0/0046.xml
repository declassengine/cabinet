At their Meeting on Wednesday, April  5th, 1933       (Cabinet  23(33)  Conclusion 5),  the Cabinet,  as a matter       or  urgency, considered the question of  the admission of       Jews  entering  this country from Germany,  and agreed  that       a Cabinet Committee composed as follows                   The Home Secretary (in the Chair)                 The Secretary of State for Foreign                    Affairs anc/or a representative:                 The Secretary of State for  the                    Colonies and/or  a representative:                 The President of the Board of Trade                     and/or a representative:                 The Minister of Labour and/or a                     representative:                 The First Commissioner of Works -       should meet  to  examine  the proposals made to the Home       Secretary on behalf of  the Jewish Community.       2.    We  attach  (Appendix I)  a  Memorandum circulated  to  the       Committee by  the Home Secretary setting out  the  facts  as  to       the present  position of  the  admission  to this country  of       Jewish refugees from Germany;   to this  Memorandum  is appended       a copy of the  proposals of  the Jewish Community, and also       (Appendix II)  a Telegram  from  R.M.Ambassador in  Berlin       containing an  estimate of  the  extent  to which German Jews       may be likely  to seek refuge abroad.       3.    It is estimated  that  there are  approximately  500,000       Jews in Germany.  It  is not  possible  to say  how  many of these       may endeavour  to leave  the  country, but the  number may be       substantial.   The  estimates  in Sir H. Rumbold&apos;s  telegram
shew that between 10,000 and 15,000 left Germany for france during the last three weeks.  Numerous Jewishfamilies have also recently migrated to HollandCzechoslovakia and Switzerland.4.   The Home Office estimate that at present there are some hundreds of German Jews temporarily visiting theUnited Kingdom; of these about 150 arrived on  April 1st,2nd and 3rd;  this number being much in excess of thenormal traffic.  It may be assumed that most of these persons (all of whom have satisfied Immigration officers as to their means, sfcc. and have been allowed to land asvisitors) are refugees.5.   The British Jewish Authorities estimate that thetotal number of Jewish refugees entering the UnitedKingdom from Germany should not exceed  three to fourthousand, the bulk being members of  the professionalclasses.  We doubt, however, whether it is possible  toform any correct  estimate at the present time as muchmust depend on events in Germany and on the policy  to beadopted in  regard  to the refugees in this and other countries.It may be noted on  the one hand that since the 1st April therestrictions on  exit from Germany  have been made more severe, while on  the other hand, although the boycott inGermany has been  raised, there is  a  general tendency toremove Jewish officials from their posts, and  to dischargeJewish workers from their employment.   If, as  seems not improbable, this  tendency is maintained, the pressure tomigrate will be greatly increased.                            -2-
is set out on pages 2 and 3 of Appendix I.    The jewish refugees from Germany who can satisfy the immigration officer in regard to means, etc. are being given leave toland subject to a &apos;time&apos; condition (limiting the periodof the visit as a rule to a month) and to a conditionspecifically forbidding employment.   In cases where theJewish refugees from Germany are unable to satisfy the immigration Officer as to their means of maintenance,leave to land is  refused.  So far, there have only been afew such cases, but it is certain  that s large number ofsuch persons are now waiting on the Continent in the hopeof being able to take advantage of relaxation of theconditions of entry.7.     The proposals of the Jewish Community contemplate that all German Jewish refugees from Germany should beadmitted without  distinction, and  that German Jews alreadyadmitted for the purpose of visits or who may be admittedin the future, should be allowed,  during the present emergency, to prolong their stay indefinitely.   The jewish community offer to guarantee temporary maintenance for  the refugees, and to facilitate their  ultimate transportation to countries other than the United Kingdom.8.     We agree with the views expressed in the concludingparagraphs of Appendix I that, whatever decision may ultimately be reached in regard to the admission of jewish refugees on the basis of the Jewish Community&apos;s guarantee,the Immigration Officers should continue to exercise theirpov/er to refuse leave to land to any individual alien on medical grounds, or on grounds personal to him such asknown criminal activities or known association withsubversive movements.
applications for visas are as a rule refused in  the  case  of jews of other than German nationality, e,g.  Polish,Hungarian or &quot;stateless&quot; persons, should he maintained forthe reasons set out on page 6 of Appendix I.10.    There remain two classes of refugees from Germany,namely :-       (1) German Jews who would, in the normal  course,           he given permission to land in this country for           a limited period  (members of the professional           classes - lawyers, doctors, school teachers, etc.)           in possession of  some means, and in many cases           coming to visit friends  or relatives in this           country;  and       (S) German Jews who would, in the normal course,           be refused leave  to land on  grounds that they           have not the means  to maintain themselves,  or           are seeking employment.11.     The following are alternative courses of actionwhich  might be adopted  :-         (a) The present  restrictions  might be made            much more severe so  as  in effect to            exclude from  admission  Class  (l) as well            as Class  (2).         (b) The present  restrictions  might be relaxed            so as  to extend  to Class  (2)  the privilege            of entry  now  enjoyed by Class (1) and to            permit  residence for an indefinite period.            This course  would meet  the  wishes of the            British Jewish Community.         (c) The present  restrictions  might, for  the            time being,  be maintained until it  is            seen how  the  situation  develops. 12.      It is  clear that  the adoption of  (a) would be strenuously opposed by  the British  Jewish Community and  by many non Jews  on the  ground  that this  country should  not deny a temporary right  of asylum to the inoffensive foreign
refugees.    This opposition would he greatly augmentedif, owing to our refusal to admit German Jewish refugees,those refugees were subjected to mal-treatment on their return to Germany.   In present circumstances such a development might lead to strained relations betweenthe two countries.13.     The adoption of (b) is also open to grave objections.  While it is true that the Jev/ish Communityare prepared to guarantee accommodation and maintenancefor the refugees, it is inevitable that sooner or later the Government will be pressed to waive the condition thatthe refugees must not enter into employment.  In any case it will be difficult to ensure that this condition isuniversally observed.  It is not possible to forecast theactual effect on unemployment of a waiver of the condition,or the extent to which the refugees might displace british labour, but we agree with the Minister of Labour that public opinion would be extremely sensitive on the subject,and that if it could be demonstrated in a few individual cases that British workmen had lost their jobs to jewish refugees,  the demand for a reimposition of the restrictions and their  rigid enforcement would be irresistable.14,     Moreover, the adoption of (b) is bound to raise  inan acute form the question of the repatriation to thiscountry of the British born migrants to the United Statesof America, and elsewhere, who have become naturalisedforeign subjects.  It is known that there are thousands  ofthese persons who are anxious to return to the UnitedKingdom but who are prevented from doing so by the operationof the Aliens restrictions.  To admit these persons would add to the unemployment problem, but it would be verydifficult to justify the exclusion of the British born
alien if the German Jewish refugee is to be  freelyadmitted.15.     The British Jewish Community observe that thearrangements proposed by them &quot;can at the best be only temporary and negotiations are in progress with a view tothe ultimate transmigration of the refugees  to countries other than England&quot;.   We are advised by the ColonialOffice that so far as Palestine is concerned,  the numberof Jewish refugees who could be allowed to enter thecountry is strictly conditioned by what the  country canabsorb.   The matter is one for the High Commissioner, butthere is no reason to suppose that room could be found inPalestine in the near future for any appreciable number ofGerman Jewish refugees.  The number of refugees who mightbe transmigrated to the Colonies generally,  must betreated as negligible.16.     In all the circumstances we consider that the best plan will be to adopt course (c), i.e. to maintain theexisting arrangements for the time being, so as to see how the situation develops.   If in, say 3 weeks&apos;  time, theposition had become much more acute by reason of asubstantial increase in the number of German jewish refugees entering the country under the existing procedure,we suggest that we should be authorised to reconsider thematter and submit a further Report to the Cabinet.   Theonly modification which we now suggest in the existing arrangements is that, for the time being, the conditionsregarding duration of visit and non-employment should be augmented by a further condition that the refugee should,in every case, register himself with the police immediately on reaching his United Kingdom destination.
17.     In this connection,- it has  been suggested to  us that having regard to the international aspects  of theGerman Jewish refugee problem, it might be desirable, ifthe position further deteriorates in the near future, toarrange for the problem to be considered by the  Inter-national Office for Refugees of the League of Nations.We have asked the Foreign Office to advise us on thissuggestion.18.     If the Cabinet accept our suggestion that theexisting procedure should be maintained for the  present,we think that the British Jewish Authorities should beinformed accordingly, and that it should, at the same time,be intimated to those Authorities that, in cases whereGerman Jewish refugees have been given permission to  landfor a temporary visit and desired to extend it,  theGovernment would be ready to consider a further extensionprovided that the Jewish Community  were prepared to guarantee, so far as may be necessary, adequate means ofmaintenance for the refugees concerned.19.     We submit the following recommendations  :-        (l) That the existing arrangements relative            to the admission and exclusion of            German Jewish refugees  should be maintained            for the time being until it is seen how            the situation develops:        (2) That the existing arrangements should be            strengthened by the addition to the            conditions regarding duration of visit and            non-employment already  required, of a            further condition that  the refugee should            in every case register  himself with the            Police immediately on reaching his            destination in the United Kingdom.
(3)  That the answer to the  British Jewish    Authorities should he to the  effect  that    there can be no question at  the  present    time of relaxing the restrictions  on    the entry of aliens to  the United  Kingdom    for the benefit of German Jewish refugees.    In cases where such refugees  had been    given permission to land for  a temporary    stay, and desired to extend  it,  the    Government would be prepared  to  consider    a further extension provided  that  the    Jewish Community were prepared to  guarantee,    so far as might be necessary, adequate    means of maintenance for the  refugees    concerned.(4)  That the Committee should continue to watch    the situation and, if necessary, should    report further to the Cabinet after the    Eyster Recess.Signed on behalf of the Committee.

                                 -:- -                     hi O i[*THIS DOCTEIENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.) SECRET. A.R.

The Present Position  in regard  to  the Admission             of Jewish Refugees from Germany  to this  country.                 Memorandum by the Home Secretary.             Jewish  Refugees, who have  left Germany owing  to       persecution,  or fear of persecution,  have now  hegun  to       arrive at the ports in this country.   There is reason  to       believe  that a number of persons who  have recently arrived       irom  Germany and have been  given leave to land as  visitors,       are in fact  Jews whose journey  has been prompted by  the       desire to escape from orevailing conditions in Germany.   In       the last  few days  there has been a marked increase in  the       numbers  of  alien visitors allowed  to  land on  time-conditions       at Harwich  and Dover;  in the first  two days  of  this week 100       aliens were  so landed, and  on Tuesday 50.  This  is far in excess       of the normal traffic, and  analysis  of the  records shews  that       the bulk  of this increase is due  to  an influx of Germans,       mainly of the professional  classes  and probably Jews.   These       persons  have of course satisfied  the Immigration Officer  as       to their  means etc., and have been  allowed  to land  in       accordance  with ordinary procedure.   Many of  them  have,       however,  admitted  to the Immigration Officer  that  they are       refugees.             An  influx of Jews from Germany  is anticipated by  Jewish       organisations in this country and  proposals for  the  maintenance       in this  country of  refugees from Germany have been made by  a       representative Committee of Jewish organisations:  a copy of       these proposals is  attached (see Appendix).
        Under the provisions of the Aliens Order,  1920,no alien may land in the United Kingdom without the  leave ofan Immigration Officer, and Article 1 (3)  of the Orderprovides that leave shall not be given to&quot; an alien to landin the United Kingdom unless he complies with the following conditions, that is to say :-        (a) He is in a position to support himself and            his depend ants:        (b) If desirous of entering the service of an            employer in the United Kingdom he produces a            permit in writing for his engagement issued            to the employer by the Minister of Labour.        (c)               ...        (d) He is not the subject of a certificate given            to the Immigration Officer by a medical            inspector that for medical reasons it is            undesirable that the alien should be            permitted to land:        (e) (f)  (g)       .  .  .        (h) He fulfils such  other requirements as may be            prescribed by any general or special            instructions of  the Secretary of State.        Generally speaking,  persons coining to this country on business, for visits to friends, for purposes of study, etc.who satisfy the Immigration  Officer are given leave to landfreely, and no condition is  attached to their stay.   They areexpected, however, to leave  the country again in due courseunless permission is given them by the Home Office to established themselves here, and steps are taken to secure that such-persons do not remain indefinitely.   They are not,  of course at liberty to take employment without permission, while here,and are warned to this effect in proper cases, on arrival, in                        2.
some cases a condition specifically forbidding employmentmay be attached to the grant of leave to land.   If the immigration Officer has reason to think that permanent residence may be attempted or that there is any other reason far limiting an alien&apos;s stay, he attaches a timecondition to the grant of leave to land.  It is open to an alien so landed to apply to the Home Office for anextension of this condition.       The Germans who have been allowed to land as visitor oin the last few days have all had time conditions attachedto their stay by the Immigration Officer, and any futuresimilar arrivals will also have their stay limited as totime.       There arpear  to be three classes of refugees fromGermany to be considered :-       (1) German Jews who would in the normal course           be given permission  to land in this country           for&quot;a limited period (members of the professional           classes - lawyers, doctors, school teachers,           etc.)  in possession of some means, and in many           cases coming to visit friends or relatives           in this country.       (2) German Jews who would in the  normal course be           refrised leave to  land by the  Immigration           Officer on arrival on such grounds as (a) and (b).           ab ove.       (3) Jews  of other than German  nationality, e.g.           Folish, Hungarian or stateless persons.      The recent arrivals all come within the first class.      There is no doubt that the majority of  them, and alsomany  other German Jews who are  already  in this country ontime  conditions, will wish to remain here until conditionsare more  settled in Germany, or for an  indefinite period.It may be taken  that some hundreds of German Jews are now inthis  country on  visits subject  to a limitation of time,and if such persons continue to be landed in the ordinary course of the administration of the Aliens Order, the resultwill be the  addition to the  population of this country of a
 considerable number &amp;f German Jev/s v/ho wish to remain indefinitely.   Mr. Schiff, of the Jews Temporary Shelter, v/ho  has been principally concerned in the organisation of the Committee to assist Jewish refugees, considers that the bulk of the refugees from Germany will be of the professional class and estimates that the total number should not exceed some three or four thousand. In theory, the Home Office will have power to regulate the  stay of such people by refusing to grant further extensions, but in practice it may prove very difficult to insist  -a their return to Germany while present conditions continue in that country.   These persons,  when admitted? will hove sufficient means for a short stay  and no doubt will also obtain assistance in many cases from friends here, but the question of maintenance or v/ork in this country is bound to arise eventually.    It appears from  the proposals put forward by the Jewish community that  the Jewish community is prepared to undertake temporary responsibility for their maintenance and accommo- dation.    Many of these people will not be in a position ever  to exercise their professions in Germany again, and it is certain that if they are allowed to stay applications will eventually be made for permission for some  at least to engage in various occupations in this country, e.g.5 as teachers,  doctors, dentists, clerks,domestic servants,  hospital  nurses, etc.    It  is possible that   there may be a certain  number who could usefully  be absorbed by this country:   it  is thought,  for  example, that some   of  the fur trade  which  has hitherto  centred in Leipzigmay be,  at least temporarily,  transferred  to London, and if  so  there  v/ould  be  room  for  a  certain  number of    Jewish   fur   traders    here.     In   other  cases the   proposals  of  the  Jewish  Committee indicate that an
endeavour will be made to remove at least some of the refugees to countries other than England, and there is reason to believe that if persons of this category are allowed to accumulate here it is the intention of theJewish community to endeavour to have some of them sentto  other parts of the Empire.   The Colonial Office maybe  in a position to say how far such an intention couldbe  carried out or facilitated.  (2)   Under the administration of the Aliens Order atpresent, Jewish refugees from Germany who are unableto  satisfy the Immigration Officer as to their means ofmaintenance would be refused leave to land.   So far,only three persons who definitely belong to this categoryhave arrived:  a German engineer, aged 31, who had losthis job owing to persecution and was in possession of100 Marks;  a German law student, aged 22, in possessionof  170 Marks;  and a German apprentice tailoress, aged 18,in possession of  2.   The two men were refused leave to  land;  the girl, in view of special hardships in hercase, was allowed, purely on compassionate grounds, toland for a limited period.   There is as yet no indication of an influx of this kind of case, but it is to be notedthat the proposals made by the organisation Committee ofthe Jewish community contemplate that all such personsshall be given leave to land and taken over by the agents of the organisation for maintenance and accommodation.It is for consideration whether there is airy ground fora relaxation of the provisions of the Aliens Orderso as to allow of the admission of persons of this class on the basis of the  guarantee given by theJewish community.     What  is said above  as to the
difficulties which, may arise in the ultimate disposal ofrefugee cases applies, of course, equally or with greater foresto cases of this category if they are admitted.(3)  Jews of other than German nationality are mainly Polish,Hungarian or &quot;stateless&quot;.   All such persons require a visafor entry into this country and it is therefore possible todecide the question of admission in each individual case beforethe alien comes to this country.   So far very few applicationsfor the admission of such persuns to thi3 country on theground of their desiro to escape persecution in Germany havebeen referred by British Consuls or Passport Control Officers,but at present, unless on other grounds the applicant wouldin the ordinary course be granted a vise, such applicationswould be refused.  There has been a certain number of applica-tions by such persons to visit friends or relatives in thi3country, but in circumstances which indicate that the realmotive is a desire to escape from Germany;  these, on present practice, are refused.  It is understood that the proposals ofthe Jewish community are not intended to apply to persons ofother than   German nationality, and it would seem that ifsuch persons desire to leave Germany their proper place ofrefuge is their own country rather than this country.  In thecase of stateless persons, who are not in possession of anynational passport, there is no guarantee, if once they are admitted to this country, of securing their admission to anyother country, and it has therefore long been the settledpractice to admit such persons to this country very sparingly, only for limited periods, and only where the person ia inpossession of a return visa for some other country valid upto the end of his visit.     It will be seen that the proposals of the jewish community contemplate:-     (a) That all German Jewish refugees from Germany should         be admitted without distinction;
                                  (Sgd.)  JOHN GILMOUR.Office, S.W. 1.  April, 1933.             /                   7.     (b) That German Jews already admitted for the purpose         of visits or who may be admitted in the future should         be allowed during the present emergency to prolong         their stay indefinitely.     It may be taken that the Jewish community is willing andhas ample financial moans to implement its guarantee of temporary maintenance for the refugees, and the main question for consideration is whether their admission may not resultultimately in a considerable addition to the permanentpopulation of this country.  There is from this point of view-little distinction between classes (1) and (2) above, sincewhatever tho means of maintenance of those in class (1) on arrival, they will in due course, in the majority of cases,-b-ecome. d-opandent upon the Jewish community here for their cujppaxt..     It should be understood that if it is decided to admit, orcontinue to admit, Jewish refugees on the basis of the guaranteegiven by the Jewish community, Immigration Officers willcontinue to exercise their powers to refuse leave to land toany individual alien on medical grounds or on grounds personalto him such as known criminal activities or known association with subversive movements..     There is, of course, a risk that the influx of refugeesfrorrGermany may includs a certain number of Communists, but any who are prominent in the Communist Movement are known, andwould be excluded by the Immigration Officers.  As regards other  persons who are suspected, on arrival, of Communistactivities, stops can be token to see that they arc refusedleave to land or that the question of giving them leave ioreferred to tho Secretary of State for decision.

Arrangements have been made for a special organisation committee with Mr. Otto Schiff as Chairman.   Arrangements have alsoteen made for a Hospitality Committee with which ladies will be associated and which will deal mainly with professional ana studentclasses.        2.   Arrangements can be made for the immediate accommodation at short notice of 500 persons made up as follows:  in the JewsTemporary Shelter 160, Downings L.C.C. Registered Lodging House 100;Salvation Army Middlesex Street 100, Scandinavian Homes 100, SundryHomes 40.         3..-.  This accommodation, with the exception of the JewsTemporary Shelter, will only be temporary and arrangements arebeing made for the provision of more permanent homes amongst theJewish  community for the refugees.         4.   All expense, whether in respect of temporary orpermanent  accommodation or maintenance will be borne by the jewish community without ultimate charge to the State.         5.   It  is appreciated that these arrangements can at thebest  ce  only  temporary and negotiations are in progress with a viewto  the  ultimate transmigration of the refugees to countries otherthan England.   Arrangements have been made to have all continentaltrains  met by representatives of the Jews Temporary Shelter.   Inthis  connection it would facilitate the arrangements if ins cruetionscould &quot;be given to Immigration Officers at all ports to telephone thenumbers  of Jewish refugees arriving at the ports to the JewsTemporary Shelter at Ro3&apos;al 0757 and 0758, at the expense of theJewish  community.   If possible, the telephone message shouldspecify  the numbers of men, women and children respectively.                             -i-

                  APPENDIX II.                                   NO DISTRIBUTION.Telegram (en clair)  from Sir H. Rumbold (Berlin).      D.  5th April, 193-3.      R.  5th April, 1955.No. 11 SAVING.       Your telegram No. 30.       It is difficult to estimate the extent to which Jev/sare likely to seek refuge abroad, except on the basis ofsuch figures as can be obtained of Jewish emigrationduring recent days.   These figures are also very difficultto estimate, as the United Kingdom, Holland, Switzerlandand Czechoslovakia do not require visas for Germans.  such information as I have been able to obtain at short noticeregarding this emigration is as follows:       United Kingdom.   Many enquiries have been receivedregarding the conditions of entry into and of residence  inthe United Kingdom, but it is impossible in absence ofvisas to estimate here the number of Jews v/ho have left  forthe United Kingdom.       Palestine.    During period 1st March to 4th April the passport Office here has received about 2,000 to 2,5C0applications for visas for Palestine.    Many have been rejected as applicants were not in possession of adequatefunds, but about 600 visas have been granted, of whichperhaps 400 were for Jews.       Prance.    Visas are granted by all of 15 FrenchConsulates, and Embassy do not possess total figures.  Theymay be estimated from the fact that  during the week ending1st April Leipzig Consulate granted 400 and Berlin over  800.
 On  an  average Berlin formerly granted 30 a day and now 150.   On the day preceding and on the day of the &quot;boycott 250 were granted.   Germans may proceed to the Gaar without visas, and many have doubtless availed themselves of this means of escape, while others already possessed valid visas. First Secretary of French Embassy estimates total number of visas for France issued in Germany in the last three weeks as between 10,000 and 15,000.   French Government do not at present propose to place restrictions on the entry of Jews.       Holland.    No visa necessary, and it is therefore impossible to estimate numbers.   Only those with funds are allowed entry, but Legation believe these to be numerous and quote 220 families who passed the frontier at one place in one day.    The Legation state that Committees have been set up to assist emigrants and even camps formed to lodge them.   The Legation have enquired whether in view of the numbers it is intention of Government to impose visa.       czechoslovakia and Switzerland do not require visas but Legations believe numbers of German emigrants to be considerable.   Numbers of Poles and Balkan Jews have applied for visas to both countries.   In Switzerland, as in Holland, no Jew is allowed to enter unless he has funds, or to take up a job.       As regards restrictions on exit  from Germany, it is reported that at Breslau and elsewhere Jews have hud to surrender their passports.  Since April lot all Germans are required to obtain special exit visas.   I cannot say how long these measures will remain in force.       As regards taking money abroad the usual restrictions on export of foreign currency are still in force.    jews wishing to take up residence in Palestine must give  proof ofpossessing  1,000 and are granted permission  to export  this sum by German authorities.                     -ii-
