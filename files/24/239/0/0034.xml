W oR.Foard of Trade,   24th March,  1933.
CONFIDENTIAL.                                              A.C.257.                       BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL.                       STATE OF TRADE -  FEBRUARY,  1933.             Summary of Reports submitted by members of  the Board               of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some                 cases with information  from other sources).             Employment -  The total number  of persons on the registers        of the Employment Exchanges in Great Britain at  20th February        &quot;was 2,856,633,  a decrease of 46,427  as compared  with        23rd January,  thus showing a slight  improvement.   The main        variations in the various Divisions  were:   London, South        Eastern and South Western -16,534, Midlands -6,180, North        Eastern -f-2,315, North Vfestern -5,603,  Scotland,  -8,544 and        Wales -11,881.             Insured workers in employment at 20th February, numbered        9,340,000, an increase of 55,000 as  compared with the previous        month; but a decrease of 45,000  as compared with a year ago.        The improvement in employment occurred chiefly in the &quot;building,-.        public works contracting,  clothing and shipping  industries        which normally show a recovery in the first half of the year-.        There was some improvement also  in the iron and  steel, tinplate-^        general engineering, woollen and worsted,  silk and artificial        silk, hemp, rope and lace industries,  and  in boot and shoe        manufacture.   There was a slight decline  in the coal-mining,        motor vehicle,  glass, electrical engineering, electrical        apparatus, cotton spinning and carpet industries, in the        distributive trades and in the dock  and harbour  service.             Overseas Trade - Imports in February,  1933, were         49,077,000 compared with  70,176,000 in February,  1932-        Exports of United Kingdom produce and manufactures were         27,928,000 compared with  30,012,000;  exports  of  imported        merchandise fell to  4,483,000  in comparison with  5,452,000        in February, 1932.   The excess  of  imports over  exports of                                      -1-
merchandise, &quot;bullion, and specie was  22,379,000 compared with 33,865,000 a year ago.     Rail and Road Traffic - During the 8 weeks ending26th February,  1933, the railway traffic receipts declined by 1,599,000 (7,56ft) as compared with the corresponding period for 1932, the decline in passenger train traffic being 4.54^5,in coal, coKe and patent fuel traffic 1.89$ and in merchandise,minerals and livestock 14.43$.   Preliminary figures for 1932&quot;show that the total number of passenger journeys (excluding the London Tubes and Metropolitan District Railway) fell by %, while the passenger revenue fell by 7$$ as compared with1951.   Freight tonnage fell by 7$, this being due largely tothe decline in ^oal, coke and patent fuel, road-making materialiron and steel  and bricks, blocks and tiles.     New registrations of motor cycles in January, 1933,compared with January, 1932, showed a decrease of 1,752 (41.4$)Registrations of other vehicles showed an increase of 825(4.7?$) comprising an increase of 1,430 private cars, and adecrease of 605 commercial and other vehicles.     Coal-mining -  The average weekly output for the 15 weeicsending February 18th was 4,407,000 tons, being ,9% less than inthe corresp*commanding period a year ago, and 4.6$ less than in thecorresponding period in the year 1930/31.   The output was 80$of the average  weekly output of 1913 and 88$ of the average weekly output of 1929.     The average employment for the 13 weeks ending February18th was 782,400.   The average output per person was.63 tons, which was  .52 tons higher than in the correspondingperiod a year ago, and .65 tons higher than the average weekly output of 1915.     Coal exports for January, 1953, as compared with December,1932, show an increase of 128,000 tons, and the coal exported
for &quot;bunkering purposes a decrease of 163,000 tons.    South V/alesand the North Eastern (Newcastle district)  show small increases,and the remaining districts decreases, the most considerablebeing on the East Coast of Scotland.     British exports of coal to the Irish Free State in January,1933, were over 10,000 tons less than in December,  1932, and64,000 tons less than the monthly average in 1932.     As regards the export position generally, there is little change to record.   As regards South Vales  it is possible thatthe tonnage exported might have been &quot;better but for the factthat a gale delayed shipping and the recent heavy snowstormaffected the working of the collieries.     Iron and Steel - Conditions in February remained quiet,  butBritish producers are now securing the bulk of the  home ordersfor semi-finished steel.   The home demand  for finished steelhas improved slightly, but export trade is  still greatlyhampered by currency restrictions.     In Scotland the outlook on the Clyde has improved; there ismore work in hand than at any period in 1932, and exportenquiries have increased.   On the North East Coast and inSouth Wales there has been little change.   The galvanised sheetexport trade is encountering intense foreign competition.     The output of pig-iron in February 1933 was 270,800 tons compared with 323,500 tons in February, 1932; the corresponding figures for steel ingots and castings were  482,700 tons and480,600 tons.     Shipping and Shipbuilding - The decline in freight ratesshown in the Summary for the previous month has continued, theindex having doclined from 80.51 in January to 79.32 inFebruary.   The estimate of laid-up tonnage given in the Summaryfor December is confirmed, the figure for British shipping at1st January being 1,934,536 net tons as compared with
2,152,252 net tons at 1st October, 1932, a decrease of just over 200,000 tons.   The effect of the new shipbuilding ordersreferred to in previous reports is shown in slightly increasedactivity on the Tyne and Clyde.     Machine Tools - There is little sign of any improvement inthe home trade.   Exports in February, 1933, were  163,000compared with  250,000 in February, 1932.   Of the total, 120,000 went to Russia, compared with  214,000 in thecorrespondi-ng period in 1932.   Imports of machine tools1                                                   vcontinue to decline.     Electrical Industry - The output of electricity byauthorised undertakings in February, 1933, amounted to1,151 million units, an increase of 1,6% on February, 1932.  Forthe first two months of 1933 the increase was 8.4Jt on thecorresponding period of last year.     The percentage of productive capacity in use fell slightlyduring the month, largely owing to a heavy fall in the export market and a fairly serious decline in the home market forsmaller apparatus.     The indices (1920 a 100) for orders received for heavyplant in February, 1933, were Home 66 compared with 47 inFebruary, 1932, and Export 64 compared with 111.     Orders for light material have decline considerably,largely owing to increased imports of wireless sets, valves and parts (including meter parts and lamps).     Motor Industry - There is little change in the home market.Export business continues to expand, particularly in Australiaand New Zealand, but exporters are apprehensive of a possibledepreciation of the dollar,  with a consequent loss of thepresent exchange advantage.     y/ool - Exports of tops and worsted yarns fell during january owing to the politicial uncertainity in Germany.
Business in yarns and fully manufactured goods remained below normal during February and prices were unremunerative.   TheUnited States crisis vvas an unsettling factor owing to thepossibility of a rise in sterling.     Cotton - There was very little change in the position inFebruary compared with January.   Deliveries of rav/ cotton tospinners fell slightly to an average of 26.9 million lbs. aweek compared with 27.1 million lbs. a week for January.   Therewas, however, an increase in the weekly rate of consumptionduring the month of February.   Unemployment increased slightly in the second and third weeks of Feoruary, but the percentageof unemployment was still below what it was in February 1932.The position in the weaving section was slightly better than inthe spinning section.   Raw cotton prices, after decliningslightly in January, remained steady in February notwithstanding the appreciation of sterling and the uncertainly as to thepossible effect of the cotton acreage restriction Bill in theUnited States.   The recent crisis there has, however, affected the cotton market.     Conditions in the home market in January were ratherunsatisfactory, and there was a marked decline in the sales ofpiece goods, the drop in January compared with a year earlierbeing greater than in any month of 1932.   British exports inJanuary, 197 million square yards, showed little change fromthe December figure.   There were gains in China, India, theBritish Dominions, Argentina, Colombia and Foreign West Africa,but exports to British Y/est Africa were nearly 6 million square yards less than in December.   The preliminary figures of japanese exports are 154 million square yards in January ascompared with 211 million square yards in December, the Januarytotal being the lowest since last April.   It is pointed out,however, that almost the whole of the decline took place in the
first ten days of the month when trade is normally affected bythe New Year Holidays, and at the and of January exports  hadfully regained their former level.     Other Industries - The home demand for rubber tyres  remainssteady and the United Kingdom share of the export market  is greater now than in the last two years.   The effect ofretailers&apos; carriod-over stocks of Japanese rubber shoes is                                                       &quot;being felt.   The demand for margarine in February showed a 20 improvement over January but is still affected by the low pricesof butter.   Production of oils and fats showed about 10$increase over January.   In heavy chemicals and dye stuffs theoutlook is less satisfactory.   Orders for fertilisers. however,are substantially in excess of last season&apos;s.     Finance and Banking - (a) London.   Money rates have continued weak.   Up to the middle of February the clearing banks refused to buy bills under 75 per cent., in order to forceprices up.   They,  were successful in raising the Treasury Billrate to 17s.2.84d on 17th February, but the movement could notbe sustained and by 3rd March the rate had relapsed to11s.4.39a.     The Bank of England has acquired  43 millions of goldbetween 1st January and 10th March.   Gold stocks of the  Bankwere  160 millions on 8th March.     Sterling displayed marked strength during February despitesome repatriation of American and French balances.   There hasbeen an influx of &quot;refugee&quot; money, necessitating officialintervention to prevent an undesired rise in sterling.   (b) United States.   The intensification of the banking crisieled to the hoarding of notes being followed by hoarding of golduntil the moratorium became inevitable.   The currencyrestrictions are causing a rapid contraction in the volume of sales.   It is generally hoped that the policy of bolstering upweak institutions has now come to en end.
    (Q) Prance.   The Daladier Government&apos;a final estimates showthat the &quot;budget will present a deficit which will have to be met by  long terra borrowing.   Rates for Treasury bonds were raised on  2nd February to \%% for one month and 2^;-?. for one yearcompared with 1^&apos;/- and 2;% respectively, the figures which hadprevailed since August 1932-    (d) Germany.   On February 17th a new &quot;Standstill&quot; agreement,lasting until February 1934, was concluded.   There has been a drop of Rra.600 millions in the Standstill credits, leavingRra.3.8 milliards outstanding.   Rates of interest on the standstill credits have been slightly reduced and by anextension of the &quot;Swiss clause&quot; the prohibitions on repaymentin Reichsmaric have oeen partially relaxed.     The export surplus for January 1933 was only Rm.22.7millions compared with Rra-102 millions in January, 1932, but thefigures are not strictly comparable owing to a change in themethod of computation.    (e) Sweden.   Statistics for January 1933 show that the foreignassets of the Rilcsbank and the combined Commercial Banks are49.5  higher than in January 1932.    (f) Denmark.   The Exchange Control has reduced the unfavourable visible trade balance from Kr,28,000,000 in 1931 toKr.9,000,000 in 1932, the balance being, however, on a greatly reduced total trade;  imports were reduced by 22.2$ and exportsby 14.8)t.    (g) Roumania.   The Government has found it impossible to balance the Budget and will consequently modify the foreigndebt services.     Retail Trade - The value of sales decreased by 6.4/:. inJanuary, 1933, as compared v/ith January, 1932.   This largedecrease compared with the December decrease of only 0.7&apos;/.- may bein part due to dilferences in the dates of end of season sales.
The decrease in total sales was more evenly spread over thecountry than in previous months, being 7% in the West End ofLondon, 5.8$ in Suburban London, 2.5% in the South of England,8.5f* in the North of England and 7.1$ in Scotland.   Stocksshowed a reduction of 5.8$ on last year.     Taking departmental stores only, trade in January inGreat Britain fell by 10.1% compared with 24% in the UnitedStates.     Australian Trade - For the 7 months ended January 31etthe value (in Australian pounds) of imports was  44,654,000,and of exports  64,582,000.   The corresponding figures in1931-2 were  32,200,000 and  59,867,000 respectively.     Exports of flour have diminished, while butter exports have increased.   2,554,000 bales of wool have been receivedinto store since the 1st July, of whiah 1,641,000 have been sold.   Wheat shipments up to February 23rd amounted to42,972,000 busttelB compared with 40,843,000 bushels in theprevious year.     Canadian Trade - Financial conditions showed a slightimprovement in January, 1933, compared with December, butthere was no corresponding rise in production.   The index of physical volume of business was 68.1 compared with 72.6 inDecember.   The wholesale price index fell from 64.0 to 63.9.     Exports in January were $32,000,000, and imports024,441,000.   Exports of copper, lead. zinc,oilver and timber declined, but exports of wood pulp increased.  Importsof raw cotton and wool for further manufacture declined,while imports of cotton yarn and raw rubber showed gains,     Indian Trade - Imports and exports in January, 1933,amounted to 1,065 and 1,171 lakhs of rupees, respectively,compared with 1,093 and 1,356 in January, 1932.   Net exportsof gold were 464 lakhs of rupees compared with 907 in
January 1932.   The wholesale price index was 87 comparedwith 88 in December, 1932, and 97 in January^ 1932.     The consumption of cotton piece goods rose continuouslyfrom 345 lakhs in April, 1932, to 407 lakhs in August,  1932,Imports supplying 93 and 131 of these totals, respectively.     The acreage under linseed is 2,483,000 acres this  yearcompared with an estimated area at the same date last year of2,377,000 acres.
