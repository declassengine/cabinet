? DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; 3 GOVERNMENT).Proposal of the Government of India to increase the duty on cotton piece goods of non-British origin to 75 per cent, ad valorem under the pavers conferred, by Section. 3(5) of the Indian Tariff Act.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.In August last year the Indian import duty on cotton piece goods of non-British origin was, after a reference to the Indian Tariff Board, increased from 31i&quot;% to 50% ad valorem. This was done as the result of pressure on the Government of India from commercial bodies both Indian and British, who found themselves suffering severely from the competition of Japanese imports of cotton manufactures into India at extremely low prices. The increase was made by the use of executive powers conferred on the Government of India by Section 3(5) of the Indian Tariff Act. It was based on a fall in price and increase in quantity of Japanese imports which followed, the depreciation of the yen.reducing; the growing volume of imports or checking the fall in prices of Japanese piece-goods.   In 1932 imports of Japanese cotton piece-goods reached a total of 550,000,000 yards, the major portion of which entered during the latter half of the year despite the increased rates of duty, while prices continued to show a steady tendency to decline.of denunciation had been given of the Indo-Japanese Trade Convention, the Government of India stated that it had been represented to them that the protection given in August 1932 was even then whollyS E C R ST.

insufficient.   When the Tariff Board reported the exchange stood at 10d rupees to 100 yen;    in August last it had fallen to 90j and it now is in the neighbourhood of 82. The proposed increase of the ad valorem duty therefore from $2/1 to 7% no more than represents the degree of protection decided upon in August last on the method of calculation adopted by the Tariff Board.   Nevertheless the Government of India were reluctant to increase the duty, as they had hoped that the depreciated yen would have reacted sufficiently on costs and export prices to have relieved the pressure of &apos;Japanese competition. This hope has not been realised.   Japanese imports of piece goods have shown no more than a slight decline in quantity and have remained at a high figure, while the fall in prices, checked for a time, now shows signs of continuing.   One of the most serious features of . the situation is that a number of Indian mills have already had to close down, and others are likely to follow.I considered that this proposal was deserving of support and the Board of Trade offered no observations upon it, but the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs represented that he would view with very considerable apprehension the application of the proposed increase of duties until all means had been exhausted to arrive at an agreement between the two Governments. He pointed out that the recent denunciation of the Trade Convention has aroused resentment in Japan and that the tariff proposals, which the Japanese Government rightly regard as aimed primarily at Japanese exporters, had caused, and were liable to cause in increasing measure, a feeling of bitterness which was likely to have an unfortunate effect on the relations both of India and this country with Japan and on British interests in Japan. He suggested therefore that before the duties were increased negotiations should take place.I communicated these views to the Government of India, who,in
in a telegram dated ldth May, re iterated their readiness to enter into negotiations with Japan but represented that pending the conclusion of an agreement which might take some time it was essential that there should he adequate safeguards against forestalling.   Japanese imports, they said, continued on a formidable scale of over 30uaillion yards in the month of April, and there was no indication of any improvement in prices.   Mill stocks were increasing and more Indian mills were closing down. They pressed therefore for permission to be given them to raise the duty to rj%. the Government of India \recognised that purely Indian interests might, on occasion, have to give way to Imperial considerations in regard to foreign relations, but they made it clear that in the present instance refusal of permission would be regarded in India as a sacrifice of Indian to British interests.I again consulted the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs who, impressed by these arguments, has indicated that he is prepared to acquiesce in the Government of India&apos;s proposals.   I propose therefore to inform the Government of India accordingly, but, before doing so, I think it necessary to obtain the concurrence of my colleagues.I am convinced that a refusal to allow the Government of India to increase these duties would not only cause serious, and possibly irreparable damage, to an important Indian industry but would inflame political feeling.    It has, too, to be remembered that increased duties will also benefit Lancashire which is suffering so severely from Japanese competition in the East.I should perhaps add a word as to the possible relation of this proposal to the contemplated Tariff Truce. India has not yet received an invitation to participate in the Truce, but the Government of India have informed me that in addition to the reservation regarding depreciated currencies(and
