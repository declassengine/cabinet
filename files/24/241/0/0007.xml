ffia DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government.jFCRFT. 3  copy NO._;JP. 127(33).CABINET. TRADE SITUATION IN INDIA. Note by the President of the Board of Trade.I think my colleagues will be interested to read the attached dispatch from the Senior Trade Commissioner in India, giving his general impressions of the situation on returning to duty after a year&apos;8 absence.Board of Trade,29th May, 1933.
Office of H.M. Trade Commissioner,Calcutta.4-th Hay, 1933.During the past fiscal year the value of the imports increased, as compared with the corresponding period of 1932, &quot;by Rs, 6 crores or 5 per cent, and amounted to Rs. 133 crores, and that of the total exports from India, including re-exports, fell by so  25 crores or 15 per cent,  to Rs. 136 crores.     The grand total of imports, exports and re-exports amounted to Rs. 268 crores as against Rs. 287 crores, a decrease of 7 per cent.     The balance of trade in merchandise amounted to Rs. 3.38 crores in India&apos;s favour but exports of gold amounting to Rs. 65^- crores brought the total visible balance of trade to Rs. 68.3 crores.     The increased imports amounting to Rs.6 crores are exceedingly satisfactory in view of the further decline in the export trade and may be attributed to the stimulation of purchasing power created by the proceeds of the exports of gold.     It is most satisfactory to observe that two-thirds of the additional import trade was secured by the United Kingdom, the share of which rose from Rs. 44.81 crores (35.4 per cent.)  to Rs. 48.77 crores (36.8 per cent.).     This improved position of the United Kingdom is largely due to an increase In the shipments of cotton piece-goods amounting to over Rs.4 crores, motor cars Rs.30 lakhs and machinery Rs.8 lakhs.     Imports of United Kingdom chemicals were also well maintained and the past year will,  it is hoped, prove to be the beginning of a steady improvement in the position of United Kingdom exporters to this market.So far as competitors are concerned, Japanese shipment advanced from Rs.13,3 crores (10.6 per cent.) to Rs.20.5 crores
(15.5 per cent) as a result of enormously increased shipments of all types of cotton and artificial silk piecegoods, yarns, hosiery and, glassware.      In the case of the United -States;, imports fell from Rs. 13.04 crores (10.2 per cent) to Rs. 11. 4 crores (8.5 per cent) and this notwithstanding increased imports of American raw cotton amounting to Rs. 1.61 crores. Owing to the serious handicap created by the dollar/sterling exchange,  shipments of American manufactures such as motor cars and trucks, rubber tyres, machinery and, hardware, were materially reduced while a decline of Rs. 1 crore is to be noted in the imports of kerosene oil.   The imports from Gerroai-yy rose slightly from Rs. 10.20 crores (8.1 per cent) to Rs.10.37 crores (7.8 per cent).    The most noteworthy increases occurred in yellow metal and copper sheets and in hardware.There seems no doubt whatever that the political agitation and boycott campaign has now spent itself and is a negligible factor.   On all sides one observes signs of an improvement in politioe,l and racial feeling.    This is undoubtedly due to the firm policy of the Government of India and the growing realisation on the part of Indians of all classes and of all shades of political thought that, within the short space of a year or two, their political ambitions will very largely be met.    The conclusion of the Ottawa Agreement has also had a favourable effect and has put heart into bazaar traders who had begun to lose faith in the competitive power of U.IC. goods.    The piece-goods partner of 2-Iessrs. Ralli Bros, made the significant remark to me the other day that he found a much more optimistic feeling with regard to the future of U.K. trade among his Indian friends and dealers than was noticeable among Europeans in India or oven in the United Kingdom.   Although there are still many difficulties to be overcome, I am inclined to the opinion that the Indian view on this occasion is the correct one.    The General Llanager
143in India of the Dunlop Company Limited informs me that during a recent tour of his Indian Branches he found a better feeling everywhere apparent and a pronounced disposition to purchase British goods.    Similarly, the General Manager in India of Messrs. Morris Industries Limited reports that he haa had an excellent year and the same comment would apply to all the lead-ing U.K. motor manufacturers serving this market.    It must be recognised that the United States has temporarily,  due to ex-change difficulties, found it jjracticaliy impossible to compete in specialities such as motor vehicles, tyres, chemicals, etc. etc., and her place has been taken by the U.IC. makers.    The recent departure of the United States from the gold standard may, however, cause a serious modification in the position.The first results in India of the departure from gold on the part of the 17.S.A. have been whol^ favourable.    I attach extracts from recent market reports issued by Messrs. Place, Siddons and Gough, the leading share brokers, from which you will observe that, as a result of speculative activity both in the States and in Calcutta, there has been a much better demand for jute and jute fabrics during the past two weeks and very substantial rises have been seen in the jute, hessian and mill share markets.    If, as a result of the Anglo-American conversations and the forthcoming ,-Torld Economic Conference, there is a world-wide advance in the prices of primary commodities, India will be one of the first countries to benefit and the removal of the temporary advantage enjoyed by U.JC. manufacturers by reason of the depreciation of sterling, will be far more than offset by that general revival in the Indian,   market, which would be a practical certainty.
It is still too soon to assess the results of the Ottawa Agreement as the preferential duties only came into force in January,  1933.      Vpart from the generally improved feeling on the part of dealers,  which I have already noted, I. find that local &quot;branch offices and agents of British manufacturers who now enjoy preferential treatment are hopeful of materially improving their position when the purchasing power in the Indian market revives.Public attention at the moment is largely focussed upon Japanese imports which, as I have shown, advanced last year by 50 per cent, from Rs.13 to Hs.20^ crores.     The fact should not be lost sight of that 75 per cent, of these imports represent textile yarns and fabrics.     If, as a result of the forthcoming Ootton Industry Protection Bill, an adequate margin of preference is secured to Lancashire and when the Indian Safeguarding of Industries   Bill protects the market from the depreciation of the Yen and from &quot;dumping&quot;, even Japanese competition may not be found to be so   serious as it is at present.     There seems no doubt that the Japanese Government will be prepared to enter into negotiations with the Government of India, for a fresh Indo-Japanese agreement and if, in addition to this, conversations between United Kingdom and Japanese industrialists with regard to the Empire markets bear fruit, we may see a completely changed position in twelve months time. Although the Japanese menace is,  at the moment, of vital importance, the.Government of India are now armed with powers to meet it and if only Lancashire interests will have patience and will refrain from uttering extreme sentiments, which have the worst possible effect in this country, and which may
V45seriously compromise the passing of the cotton preference hill in the Assembly, the position in India - even of Lancashire - will probably be considerably improved by the end of the present year.(Sgd.) THOMAS M. AIHSCOUGH. H.M. Senior Trade Commissioner in India.
