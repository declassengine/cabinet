TO SWITZERLAND.Cypher telegram to II.M&apos;s Consul.   (Geneva).Foreign Office.12th May,  1933.2. 30 p.m.No.   228.oOoIMMEDIATE.Following for Mr. Eden.At Cahinet Committee this morning following conclusions were reached:Germany is clearly manoeuvring for position.      It is vital that she should not be enabled to manoeuvre herself off the defen-sive.      It is essential that we should keep the discussions on the broad issues on which public opinion is united against Germany and avoid being driven into details about guns,  tanks, aeroplanes,  etc. on which opinion would be muddled and divided.      You should there-fore try to concentrate on effectives,and persuade French to agree to this.      Public opinion here is united in opposition to German attitude.      If you cannot avoid question of material being raised, you should refuse to discuss details until principles are settled. You should therefore refuse to formulate or discuss any detailed figures, until Germany has accepted the principle that equality must be reached by stages, and until principles are settled accord-ingly.      Germany&apos;s attitude (e.g. Neurath&apos;s speech) makes this vital.If, as you apprehend, you are asked to produce figures for tanks, your reply might take the form of a firm statement somewhat on the following lines suggested by the Prime Minister:-&quot;What is the use of asking us to fill in figures in present circumstances?      Will anyone tell me that the present difficulties
of the Conference arise out of figures?     Everyone knows quite well that this is not the case.&apos;      Does the German Delegate suggest that the situation in Europe  is the same as.six months ago?     That is not so.     Events  in Germany more especially have altered the whole situation.      What Europe now requires is a definite pronouncement from Germany as to the policy which she intends to pursue&quot;.Subject to your own appreciation of the  situation at the moment we think you might take some such line very firmly, remaining immovable on question of details at the present stage or until a decision has been reached on the large question of whether Germany accepts the principle of disarmament by stages, and nothing that could really be re-garded as rearmament by Germany.      If it Is impossible to avoid question of samples, you would have to say that our attitude was defined in Command Paper 4189 (1932) see especially pages 3 and 5.      If an elaboration of that is required it is Germany&apos;s duty to make proposals.      Above is line which we think you should take on Saturday.      Secretary of State hopes to fly out on Sunday,,
