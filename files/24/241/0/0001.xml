THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1933.SECRET. Copy No. 28CP. 121 (33).CABINET.THE PARTICIPATION OF THE ROYAL AIR FORCE IN WORLDAIR RECORDS.Note by the Secretary of State for Air covering a Memorandum, by the AirMinistry.I CIRCULATE herewith a departmental memorandum on the difficult question of world air records. I feel it only right to consult my colleagues before taking a final decision, as a demand is springing up in certain circles that the Royal Air Force should set out to recapture the speed record recently obtained by the Italians. Indeed, the aeronautical press is beginning to advocate this course, and the matter has become one of immediate urgency as a result of a question put down for last Wednesday enquiring our intentions. This has been postponed temporarily, but an answer may become necessary at any time.The memorandum states very clearly the cogent objections to setting out to recapture the record at the present stage of development. It is not merely a question of money, but also of risk to life and limb and interference with other more pressing Service requirements without any compensatory advantage save the &quot; intangible&quot; of enhanced prestige and the potential benefit to the industry which it is clear has been much exaggerated. It seems to me that the only possible conclusion is that the objections altogether outweigh the advantages, but I wish to be assured, before any public announcement is made, that my colleagues share this view.It is essential that, if the decision is, as I can only recommend, adverse to an attempt on the speed record, there should be no question of reversing that decision afterwards in response to public pressure, though there will no doubt be some complaint, more vocal than substantial, in certain quarters, and quite possibly agitation in some organs of the press. These will, however, be essentially artificial and I do not feel that, if our policy is clearly explained, there should be any real difficulty. Some of my colleagues may remember the considerable public outcry at the time of the refusal of the Government in 1931 to participate in the Schneider Trophy Contest. The circumstances then were very different. The contest was scheduled to take place in September in this country; the Royal Aero Club of Great Britain were the hosts; foreign entries had been duly received; and, lastly, we had won two successive contests and a victory in the race at issue would give us final possession of the much-coveted Trophy. This very special situation does not exist to-day.It is further important that we should not on this occasion base our decision only on the question of the expenditure involved. I think it most unlikely that Lady Houston or anyone else will step into the breach with an offer to find the necessary finance. But, should such a contingency arise, it is essential that we should not find ourselves in the embarrassing position of the Royal Air Force being forced into the role of &quot;hired gladiators.&quot;Accordingly I recommend to the Cabinet that our policy in this matter should be as outlined in paragraph 10 of the attached memorandum.Air Ministry, May 6, 1933. L.[8565]
Memorandum by the Air Ministry.AS a result of the recent Italian success in, establishing a new air-speed record, a decision has to be taken as to whether the Royal Air Force is to attempt to recapture the record for this country. Such a decision is urgently required as the subject has been raised in a parliamentary question, which should have been answered last Wednesday, but has been temporarily postponed.It becomes necessary in consequence to formulate a considered policy on the whole question of the position of the Eoyal Air Force in regard to air records.2.   There are only four records which need at present be seriously considered, viz. : (1) The absolute speed record, (2) The land speed record, (3) The height record, (4) The long-distance record.3. The Royal Navy (though it employs fast motor boats) does not attempt to obtain speed records by water; and the Army (though the Royal Tank Corps is vitally interested in the development of powerful internal combustion engines for purposes of mechanisation), does not concern itself with speed records by land. Such records are left and rightly to commercial and private enterprise, and the Navy and Army have no concern with them direct or indirect, technical or financial.4. In the case of the Royal Air Force, however, owing to the novelty of aeronautical technique and the relatively greater development of military, as opposed to civil, aviation, occasions arise from time to time when the Air Ministry has, to meet specific service needs, definitely to pursue a line of research and experimental development which results in the availability of aircraft suitable for attempts on records.For example, in connection with, necessary research for military purposes, an aircraft is in course of construction at the present time which will probably be capable of capturing the world &apos;&apos; height&apos;&apos; record. In such a case it seems the appropriate and commonsense course for the Royal Air Force to make an attempt to secure the world record concerned for this country. The work is, so to say, taken by the service in its stride; it is legitimate service work; the additional expense caused by the actual attempt on the record is negligible; and the risk to life and limb (in this particular case no appreciable danger should be involved), is a necessary incident of service.5. But there are other cases in which, for one reason or another, to establish 3, new record would involve (a) a large expenditure; (b) serious risk to life and limb without (c) any sufficient compensatory advantage in the enhancement of military efficiency which would, indeed, suffer as a result of wholesale diversion of effort from more urgent and legitimate requirements and actual interference with the technical programme dictated by the current needs of the service. Such cases may be clearly illustrated by the position in regard to the absolute speed record which is the genesis of this memorandum.6. To take (c) first, we have really acquired all the experience of high-speed engines (the engine is the essence of the speed problem) which we can at present digest, and are fully employed in translating that experience into practice. There is little doubt that with sufficient money and time we could by an intensive 3-year programme put up a new record, but its value to practical aeronautical develop-ment would be very slight. Moreover, an attempt to recapture the speed record would mean the concentration of a large portion of the Air Ministry&apos;s technical staff and of the staff of the engine and aircraft manufacturers concerned on this sole objective to the neglect of all other work. It is, indeed, possible that the engine and aircraft firms which would probably be selected would themselves be unwilling to face the complete dislocation of their normal research and experi-mental programme entailed.So far as the Air Ministry is concerned, it would be necessary (unless there is a considerable increase in staff both at headquarters and outstations) to put on one side the practical high-speed programme to meet specific service needs which is already in hand, and the first fruits&quot;of which are the experimental fighter which
lias recently attained a speed of about 250 m.p.h.,- thus decisively outclassing any comparable foreign machine.7. To take next (a), the question of cost, if a serious attempt is to be made to recapture this record for Great Britain; at a rough estimate a direct expenditure of at least  200,000 would be required, spread over a three-year period. Of this sum no less than  180,000 would be necessary for the -actual machines (2), engines (4), and accessories. &apos;:To make the attempt with only two machines is running a considerable risk, since, as French and Italian experience&apos;has shown, the probability of one or more accidents is high; four engines are essential since, owing to the very high rate of revolutions necessary to secure the requisite output of power, the life&apos; of such an engine is under 10 hours.Indirectly, the diversion of the time and energies of research establishments, scientific, technical and administrative staff at headquarters and outstations from their normal necessary tasks would probably be equivalent to the expenditure of at least another  50,000.Taking, however, only the direct expenditure ( 200,000), this sum would suffice to maintain 3 complete squadrons of smaller-type aircraft for a year. Such an expenditure, without any sufficient compensatory advantage in increasing efficiency, appears very difficult to defend in a time of financial stringency like the present when, moreover, our first-line strength is wholly inadequate in relation to the strengths of foreign Powers. It could not be found from present Air Estimates.8. Lastly (b), the risk to life and limb, is a factor of prime importance. Four flying personnel of the Royal Air Force have lost their lives to date in attempts on world records or in practice for the Schneider Trophy; and, in addition, there were three very narrow escapes in high-speed flying. The Italians lost four of their best pilots in less than two years in connection with the Schneider Trophy and attempts to obtain the world speed record.The danger would not deter Royal Air Force pilots from volunteering, if they were asked to do so, not by the score, but by the hundred. It is not, however, the practice to call for volunteers it is considered indeed that such a course would be undesirable in the extreme but to select and detail the most suitable officers for the duty in the normal course. Where no real advantage in military efficiency is to be gained where, in fact, all that is at issue is the winning of a &quot; sporting &quot; record it seems wholly unjustifiable for those in authority to detail flying personnel to undergo such risks. In a public speech made in 192*8, imme-diately after the death of Flight Lieutenant Kinkead in an official attempt on the speed record, Sir Samuel Hoare, then Secretary of State for Air, said : &apos;&apos; When we read of so poignant a tragedy, is it any wonder that many of us ask the question : is it all worth while? Does the pursuit of speed justify the sacrifice of human life ? If it was only the pursuit of speed, if it was only the breaking of a world &apos;s record that we were attempting to achieve, I should agree with those who ask this question. I would say, no world&apos;s record is worth such a sacrifice. I would say, the few miles more do not justify the loss of a single life.&quot;He went on to say that there was more at stake on that occasion than a mere record and that there was therefore justification for the sacrifice of human life. For the reasons explained in paragraph 6 above, that is not the case to-day, when the situation is wholly different and we are still, as stated, in process of digesting and translating into every-day service use the lessons learnt from our past victories.9. The objections to any attempt to recapture the speed record are thus of the most cogent and compelling character, but nevertheless it would be wrong to take an a,dverse decision without a brief examination of the other side of the balance sheet.What then are the advantages to be urged in favour of an attempt? Undeniably a victory redounds for the time being to the credit of British aeronautical prestige. No doubt the world reputation of the Royal Air Force has been heightened by our successive Schneider Trophy victories and securing of world&apos;s speed records. Dramatic achievements must always have a certain attraction. But it may be pointed out that the reputation of the Royal Air Force rests primarily on the &quot;general acceptance by all informed foreign opinion of the
fact that the Royal Air Force has never^ like the French and Italian air forces, sacrificed solid achievement to a policy of &quot; stunts.&quot; It is the very high average standard of efficiency maintained throughout the service that has all along attracted the serious foreign student of aeronautical affairs. Long before our first Schneider Trophy victory in 1927 we were receiving applications to give foreign officers training in our units and establishments far in excess of our capacity to absorb them.It is further generally claimed that records are of the utmost value to the aircraft and engine manufacturing industries in stimulating the market for their products in foreign countries. Clearly the achievement of a record must benefit the industry, but a dispassionate examination of the actual figures shows that this benefit is much exaggerated.We won the Schneider Trophy and established new world speed records both in 1929 and 1931; actually the total value of aircraft, engines and spares exported to foreign countries in the two years following these successes, viz., in 1930 and 1932, showed in both cases a small decline.Moreover, though the Air Ministry is most anxious to stimulate the foreign market for the products of the British aircraft manufacturing industry, it is necessary to preserve a sense of proportion. As above stated, the direct cost of an attempt on the single record now at issue would be  200,000. The total value of aeronautical exports to foreign countries in 1932 was  1,000,000. In other words, the cost of an attempt on this one record would be larger than the whole profits of the industry in the foreign export market last year, unless these were in excess of 20 per cent. In the face of the objections which have been pointed out in previous paragraphs, there seems to be ho case for so disproportionate-tionate an indirect subsidy to the industry.10. In the light of the foregoing analysis it is possible to indicate a policy which seems both&apos; sound and publicly defensible. This may be summarised as follows : (1) That His Majesty&apos;s Government shall refuse to authorise the diversion of the Royal Air Force from its normal duties and its employment to secure world records as such, where there is no genuine service purpose to be served thereby; at the present stage of development an attempt to recapture the world speed record comes under this category.(2) That, in view of the beneficial effect on British prestige and the foreign export market of the capture of world records by the Royal Air Force (though the latter has been much exaggerated), where, in the normal course of service research and experimental development, aircraft become available which are suitable for attacks on existing world records, an attempt should be made; the height record comes under this category, and it is probable that other records will again do so in due course.Air Ministry, May 5, 1933.
