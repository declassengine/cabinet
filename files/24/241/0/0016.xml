THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1933.41CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.CP. 136 (33).CABINET.PERSIA AND ARMS TRAFFIC CONVENTION.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues in the Cabinet a memorandum on an urgent question which has arisen in connexion with the proposed arrangements for the control of the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf. The point is to be dealt with by a sub-committee of the Disarmament Conference in the near future; and, unless a very early solution can be found, Persia proposes to withdraw from the Conference. I am anxious, if possible, to avoid this, as it would, in my opinion, greatly increase our political difficulties in the Persian Gulf area, without enabling His Majesty&apos;s Government effectively to secure any of the objects they have in view.The Persian Government, who put forward certain proposals to me on the 24th April, are daily pressing for a reply.Foreign Office, May 23, 1933.Memorandum.For some time a sub-committee of the Disarmament Conference has been considering the preparation of an international convention to deal inter alia with the question of the suppression of illicit traffic in arms, i.e., the irregular supply of arms likely to be used in certain undeveloped areas for purposes of insurrection or civil war. It was proposed that this convention should reproduce certain provisions of the abortive Arms Traffic Convention of 1925, and more especially that it should provide for the creation of a special land zone covering parts of Africa and Arabia, and of a special maritime zone, consisting of the adjacent waters, in which the warships of the contracting parties should have the right to visit and control certain classes of vessels of less than 500 tons. It was proposed that, as in the case of the 1925 convention, the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman should be included in the special maritime zone.2. The Persian Government have long raised strong objection to the inclusion of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman in the special zone, and have made it clear that they cannot be parties to any convention in which these Gulfs are so included. On the 24th April M. Sepahbodi, the Persian representative at Geneva, on instructions from his Government, called on me at the Foreign Office, having made a special journey to London for the purpose, to explain the views of the Persian Government on this question. In the first place, if Persia became a party to a convention containing such a provision, the system of control established thereby would bear unduly hardly on Persian shipping, which was concentrated in this area and most of which was under 500 tons. In any case, the inclusion of the only maritime approaches to Persia in an area specially subject to international supervision implying either imperfect local control or political instability would be incompatible with Persian self-respect. If, therefore, the proposal were pressed, Persia would have to withdraw from the Disarmament Conference. There is every reason to believe that this threat is seriously intended.3. As a result of my conversation of the 24th April with M. Sepahbodi, the following proposal, which would, I understand, be acceptable to the Persian6889   [8629] -    b
Government, has been put forward with a view to meeting the situation. The Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman would not be included in the special maritime zone provided for in the body of the Convention to be negotiated at Geneva, but would be dealt with by the following separate instruments : .4. A bilateral Anglo-Persian Convention would be concluded, by which Persia.would assume full responsibility for supervising all shipping flying the Persian flag oh the-high seas of the two gulfs, but would undertake not to claim any right to. control any shipping not flying her flag in this area. This Convention would be accompanied by a multilateral protocol (to which Persia would not, however, &quot;be a party), by which the contracting parties, in so far as each was concerned, would recognise either the exclusive right of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment,. or, alternatively, the common right of all the contracting parties to the protocol, to visit and control shipping under 500 tons not flying the Persian flag. These two . instruments would be negotiated, and would enter into force, simultaneously with the main convention, and the exclusion of the two Gulfs from the Special Maritime Zone provided for in the latter would be conditional on these two instruments being accepted.5. A decision is now required as to which of the two following alternative courses of action should be pursued : (a) His Majesty&apos;s Government could ignore the Persian representations and - continue to press for a convention closely reproducing the provisions of that of 1925, and, in particular, including the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman in the Special Maritime Zone; or .-(&amp;) An attempt could be made to meet the Persian wishes by excluding the two Gulfs from the Maritime Zone provided for in the Convention, and by dealing with them in the two separate instruments proposed in paragraph 4 above.6. The main drawback to course (a) is that&apos;, while it would almost certainly lead to the withdrawal of Persia from the Disarmament Conference and bring about a situation Of considerable Anglo-Persian friction in the Gulf area, it would not in practice give us any of the rights we desire. As Persia would not be a party to the new Convention, we should not acquire under that Convention any rights over ships flying the Persian flag, and Persia would certainly challenge any shadowy rights we may at present be exercising, more especially as those rights have no sound legal basis. Not only should we acquire no rights to visit or control ships flying the Persian flag, but it is probable that the Persians, who have not yet abandoned their claim to Bahrain and certain other islands in the Persian Gulf or recognised our special relations with the Arab rulers, might themselves claim rights over the shipping of these territories, and provoke incidents in respect of which we should be powerless to obtain any effective redress-. Further, the development of such a state of friction in the Persian Gulf would inevitably further weaken our already precarious position at Hen jam, and increase the likelihood of Persia pressing her demand for our immediate withdrawal.7. But even if we are prepared to face these risks, it is doubtful whether in practice we could secure a sufficiently general support for our policy at Geneva to make the new Convention effective. The United Kingdom delegation at Geneva have reported that the policy of the creation of special zones advocated by His Majesty&apos;s Government is viewed with little sympathy by the other Powers repre-sehted at Geneva, and that it may be a matter of great difficulty to persuade them to accept it. The matter is regarded as one mainly between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Persian Government, and there is reason to believe that the majority of the other Powers concerned strongly sympathise with the Persian point of view and will resent our action in bringing about Persia&apos;s withdrawal from the Conference. Even if we succeeded in obtaining a fair number of signatures for the new Convention, many of the signatories are likely to fail to ratify it. We may thus find that we have lost the substance for the shadow, and find ourselves able to control not only no shipping flying the Persian flag, but very little other shipping either.8. If, on the other hand, course (b) is adopted, we shall have secured Persian co-operation, which will bring with it the co-operation of other Powers.   The two
p 9[8629]Conventions proposed in paragraph 4 above will give us precisely the same rights as we should have acquired under a Convention, to which Persia was not a party, based on that of 1925. In neither case is there any hope of those rights being extended to apply to shipping flying the Persian flag.9. Objections have been raised to the adoption of course (b) on the ground that, even if in practice the results as regards the immunity of Persian shipping will be much the same, the formal exclusion of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman from the special maritime zone will weaken the value of that principle, and will be regarded locally as implying a weakening of the authority of His Majesty&apos;s Government. In particular, it has been suggested that it is important to secure by some means or other the power for His Majesty&apos;s ships to verify the right of ships flying the Persian flag to fly that flag, and objections have been raised to the idea of ships being exempt from control merely by flying a flag to which they may, in fact, possess no right. It has therefore been suggested that, if course (&amp;) is to be adopted, this should only be done conditionally on the insertion of a provision in the proposed bilateral Anglo-Persian Convention On the following lines : &apos;&apos; Both parties to agree to co-operate in checking the use of the Persian flag by unauthorised persons. For this purpose Persia will agree that His Majesty&apos;s ships should have the right, in suspicious cases, to verify that the vessel is authorised to fly the Persian flag; this right, however, to include no power of detention or diversion of the Persian vessels.&apos;&apos;10. The difficulty about this proposal is that it would be impossible to secure the agreement of the Persian Government to any such provision. The Persian representative made it clear on the 24th April that Persia&apos;s main reason for objecting to the inclusion of the Gulfs in the special maritime zone was to secure immunity for shipping flying the Persian flag from visits by foreign warships. Even if this basic difficulty could be overcome, the Persian Government would certainly insist on the right to verify the flag being reciprocal, and on Persian warships therefore acquiring a similar power to verify the right of British ships to fly the British flag. If this could be limited to United Kingdom ships, the difficulty might perhaps not be insuperable, since there are extremely few United Kingdom ships of under 500 tons in the two Gulfs. But it would, in practice, be impossible to prevent the right thus granted to the Persian Government from extending to British Indian and British-protected ships, particularly as we know that the Persians are most anxious to acquire rights over local Arab vessels, if only in connexion with the suppression of smuggling. If, then, Persia were to acquire any rights over vessels other than those flying the Persian flag, the Foreign Office consider that it is certain that they would claim the. right to verify the flags of local Arab shipping and thus acquire the power to interfere with such shipping with results which would be fatal to our prestige on the Arab coast of the Gulf and in India.11. It will be seen from the foregoing that, in the opinion of the Foreign Office, there is no prospect whatever of our acquiring the right to inspect vessels flying the Persian flag, either for the purpose of verifying the flag or for any other system of control, whether we adopted course (a) or the compromise suggested in paragraph 9 above; and that, this being so, there can be no doubt that course (b), which should enable us, with Persian consent, to maintain some degree of maritime control in the Persian Gulf, and to secure the adoption of the complete special regime in the remainder of the maritime zone and in the land zones, presents very considerable advantages. The advantages of course (a), indeed, seem to be purely illusory, while its drawbacks may well prove most serious; and I therefore trust that my colleagues will agree to the adoption of course (b), which will, in practice, secure precisely the same results, and to my addressing the Persian Charge d&apos;Affaires accordingly on the lines of the note, &quot;a draft of which is attached as Annex.
ANNEX.&apos;&quot;Draft Note to Fathollah Khan Noury-Esfandiary, Persian Charge d&apos;Affaires,London.Sir, Foreign Office, May   , 1933.IN the course of his conversation with me on the 24th April, Anoushirvan Khan Sepahbodi explained to me the views of the Persian Government on the question of the proposed inclusion of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman in the special maritime zone to be set Up under the Convention on the Traffic in Arms which is at present under consideration by a, sub-committee of the Disarma-ment Conference. M. Sepahbodi expressed the earnest hope of the Persian Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom would agree to &quot;the two Gulfs not being included in the proposed special maritime zone, and, on my drawing his attention to the difficulties which the exclusion of this area from the zone might put in the way of the effective control in the traffic in arms, put forward, under instructions from his Government, certain alternative suggestions for meeting the situation.2. M. Sepahbodi&apos;s principal suggestion was that His Majesty&apos;s Government should agree to conclude with the Persian Government a bilateral convention on the lines of the draft communicated to His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Tehran by the Persian Government on the 10th November, 1932. He explained that it was specifically provided in that draft (i.e., by article 2) that on the high seas of the two Gulfs the supervision and control of all vessels flying the Persian flag, which might be suspected of participation in the illicit traffic in arms, should/&apos;be entrusted to the naval authorities of Persia, while the supervision and control on the high seas of the two Gulfs of all vessels suspected of the illicit traffic in arms, other than those -flying the Persian flag, would be entrusted to the British naval authorities. Such a provision would, in the opinion of the Persian Government, give His Majesty&apos;s Government all the rights which they could legitimately desire, would fully provide for the adequate control of the illicit traffic in arms in the two Gulfs and the adjacent areas, and would offer a full and sufficient guarantee against its recrudescence. ^aoa3. On my pointing out to M. Sepahbodi, in reply, that it would be impossible to confer, by means of a purely bilateral convention of this type, rights on one of the contracting parties over vessels flying the flag of a third party, M. Sepahbodi explained that the Persian Government would see no objection to other Powers acceding to the proposed bilateral convention, or otherwise signifying their acceptance of its provisions in so far as they and their vessels might be concerned. This might, for instance, be done by means of a separate protocol to be concluded at the same time as the proposed bilateral convention.4.   M. Sepahbodi suggested as an alternative to the above suggestion that only the Arab side of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman should be included in the special maritime zone, and that the waters on the Persian side of the Gulfs should be left free.   I am informed, however, that this proposal would ic likely to meet with serious difficulties in practice.   .5. I have now caused the Persian Governments suggestion for the conclusion of a bilateral agreement, on the lines of their draft of the 10th November, and for the conclusion of a multilateral agreement providing for the necessary concurrence therein of the other Powers concerned, to be most carefully examined by the competent authorities of His Majesty&apos;s Government. As the Persian Government are aware, it has long been the constant endeavour of His Majesty&apos;s Government to secure by every means in their power the strictest possible control over the illicit traffic in arms. Any relaxation in the efforts hitherto made to check and control this dangerous and pernicious traffic or any public abandonment by His Majesty&apos;s Government of any of the rights hitherto exercised by them with a view to checking it, would be likely, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, to lead to a grave danger of its recrudescence, with
consequences which might well prove equally serious to all concerned. For many years the principle of the special zones has been regarded by His Majesty&apos;s Government as one of the most effective means for combating this traffic, and it is clear that there are the gravest objections to weakening this principle by the removal from the special zone of a large area which has admittedly in the past been an active centre of the traffic. On the other hand, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment are anxious to co-operate with, and to meet the views of, the Persian Government in this matter in the friendliest spirit in so far as they can do so consistently with their policy of maintaining the strictest possible effective control over the illicit traffic arms. Provided therefore that the alternative arrangements now suggested can be shown to be likely to prove no less effective, for this purpose than those hitherto contemplated, and that the new agreements proposed can be concluded in anticipation of, or simultaneously&apos;with, the main convention, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be prepared to modify their attitude in the sense desired by the Persian Government.6. In these circumstances, I have the honour to request you to inform M. Sepahbodi that, on the clear understanding that a bilateral agreement on the lines suggested by the Persian Government, with certain necessary minor modifications, is concluded without delay, and that the necessary international sanction for the relevant provisions of this agreement can be simultaneously obtained from the other parties concerned, His Majesty&apos;s Government in, the United Kingdom will be prepared to instruct their representative on the competent committee of the Disarmament Conference, as soon as these agreements have been concluded, to consent to the omission of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman from the special maritime zone laid down in the proposed convention.7. It is clear, however, that both the proposed bilateral agreement and the multilateral convention or protocol containing the necessary international sanction for it, will need careful negotiation. In view of the importance of keeping this question wholly within the framework of the Disarmament Conference, His Majesty&apos;s Government propose that this negotiation should be carried on at Geneva. If the Persian Government agree to this course, the necessary instruc-tions will be sent to the United Kingdom representative on the Disarmament Conference forthwith, and as soon as the necessary agreement has been reached with the Persian representative and with the representatives of the other Powers co -^yrned, the United Kingdom representative will inform the Conference officially of the modification of the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the question of the inclusion of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman within the proposed special maritime zone.owi e ^d i
