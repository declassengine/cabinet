Memorandum on-the Subject of certain Chances in the Organisation and; Administration of the Metropolitan police in his Annual Beport for the year 1982 (Cmd. 4294) the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis has drawn public attention to the need for making certain changes in the organisation and administration of the Force&apos;under his control with a view to the better adaptation of the existing system to modern standards and requirements.His Majesty&apos;s Government have devoted long and careful consideration to these subjects and have reached the definite conclusion that, in the interest of the welfare and efficiency of the Force, reform on the lines suggested in Lord trenchard&apos;s Report is essential.A detailed explanation of the changes which it is proposed to make in the organisation of the Force is given in Appendices I and II to this Memorandum. These changes involve certain amendments of the existing law, and legislation for this purpose will be introduced at an early date.In Appendices III, IV and V will be found a brief statement of certain necessary changes in the present system of administration and of the measures which it is contemplated should be taken, when circumstances permit, to provide improved recreational facilities for the Force.Each one of the five reforms explained in the Appendices has its own separate and special importance, and all alike are necessary to the well-being of the Force. In particular, the Government are convinced that the combined effect of the changes in organisation which it is now proposed to introduce in providing a younger and more highly trained staff of officers and a more active and energetic body of constables will be to secure not only a material improvement in the general standard of efficiency, but also a substantial economy of man-power. It is impossible to say definitely that there will be an actual reduction in the present numbers, but the improved general efficiency which will be secured should at least suffice to avoid the necessity of increasing the Force in proportion to the continuous growth in the population of the Metropolis.- The other three proposals are in a different category, but each of them also has been considered in relation to its past history and its present application, and the Goyernnient are satisfied that the
steps proposed are necessary and will help the Force to maintain the high reputation it holds in the eyes of the world and to promote an increasing sense of esprit de corps and the highest standard of conduct.In examining the financial aspects of the two proposals affecting the organisation of the Force (i.e., the new schemes for the recruit-ment of the higher grades and for the employment of a proportion of the constables on short-service engagements), the Government have had. the benefit of the advice of the Government Actuary and are satisfied that the effect of the two schemes, when they come into full operation, will not be to increase the cost of. the Force.[8563]
-   Appendix I. The System of Recruitment in relation to Higher Posts.In bulk and complexity the task to be carried put by the police of London in 1983 bears little resemblance to that which presented itself to our forefathers a hundred years ago. The fundamental duties recited in the oath taken by the constable of &apos;&apos; preserving the peace, and preventing robberies and other felonies, and apprehending offenders against the peace &apos;&apos; remain, but, for their efficient discharge under modern conditions, a far more scientific and elaborate police machine has become necessary. The methods of the criminal are becoming ever more skilful and change from year to year. Nowadays he can work easily at a considerable distance from his home and can move rapidly from place to place. To meet these changing conditions, the machine must be capable of rapid adjustment and the problem of crime has to be studied as a whole as well as in detail. Local knowledge and local vigilance no longer suffice.At the same time crime is only one of many problems with which the police are called upon to deal. There is, for example, the all-important problem of securing a reduction in the huge casualty list of the road. Whilst sixteen persons are being killed and over five hundred injured every day on the roads of England and Wales there can be no question of regarding this branch of police work as of secondary importance.Many other instances could be quoted of the extent to which a hundred years of development have tended to increase the variety and complexity of police work. Legislation has had the same effect. Difficult questions such as those&apos; involved in the enforcement of the laws relating to licensing, to betting and gaming, and to public morals come within the purview of police administration and require to be handled with skill, care and a broad outlook.In these and other ways the task of the police has become steadily wider in its scope and the whole conception of the police function in modern society has undergone a gradual change. It is not enough that the constable himself should be better educated and more highly trained. His activities must be carefully and scientifically controlled. Supervision and organisation have become of perhaps even greater importance than individual alertness and energy.After careful study of these new factors, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-rnent have reached the conclusion that, so far as the Metropolitan Force is concerned, a broadening of the basis of recruitment has become imperative for the purpose of adapting the system to modem requirements and of securing a higher standard of efficiency.For 104 years the plan originated by Sir Robert Peel in 1829 has been adhered to, and every appointment up to and including the rank of Superintendent has been filled by promotion from the ranks of those who have joined the Force as constables. This system has not in fact produced the men required to fill the highest posts, and,
throughout its history, the Metropolitan Force has never yet produced a Commissioner, or (with one exception) a Deputy or Assistant Commissioner. It has also been found necessary to recruit all but a few of the Chief Constables from outside the Force. This is an unsatisfactory state of affairs which ought, in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, to be remedied. For this purpose and with the even more important object of securing the best material that the nation can provide, it is essential to throw the net wide and so to obtain for the Force a steady supply of men of the kind that are undoubtedly needed for the work to be done in the higher ranks.It should be emphasised that the Force requires, if it is to keep pace with modern requirements, young and active ooritrol, and&apos; that there must be at the head of it a directing and supervisory staff not of one type -only, but of many types-with as good a standard of education as can be obtained, and a wide outlook. They should be specially and- thoroughly trained for their duties and given responsibility at as early an age as possible.Under jjresent arrangements before a Metropolitan police constable can become a Superintendent he has to serve for a certain number of years in each of the ranks of Constable, Sergeant, Station Sergeant, Inspector, Sub-Divisional Inspector and Chief Inspector. No doubt a better supply of qualified men could be obtained in the higher ranks if constables possessing the requisite qualifications of education, character and personality were given earlier opportunities of advancement, and it is an essential part of the new scheme that such opportunities should be given. But this will not by itself meet the needs of the case. The time has clearly arrived for bringing the system of recruitment to the Metropolitan Police Force into line with the practice of the other public services and the steadily growing practice of business undertakings.His Majesty&apos;s Government propose accordingly that a certain number of young men shall be recruited by a system of competitive selection with or without written examination for appointment, after suitable training, to posts of the Inspector grade. These men would be selected from those who have joined the Force as constables and from candidates from the secondary schools, public schools and universities.This proposal relates solely to the Metropolitan Force, not only because the direct responsibility of the Government (in virtue of the statutory position of the Home Secretary as police authority for the Metropolis) is limited to that Force, but also because the problem presented by this body of 20,000 men is fundamentally different from that which arises in the case of any other Force, the largest of which is only about&apos;one-tenth of the size of the Metropolitan Police Force.What is proposed may be rightly described, as revolutionary because of its far-reaching effects, but it is no sudden or novel proposal. It is substantially what was recommended as long ago as 1868 by the first Committee to inquire into the organisation of theiwinwrifiai BMiiii inimiirininmmBiniiam
Metropolitan Police after; its foundation by Sir Robert Peel in 1829. That Committee pointed out that Peel&apos;s system was one adapted only to the government of 3,000 men (the original size of the Force) and therefore likely to be defective when applied to the government of 8,000. The system has, however, been maintained ever since and the growth of the Force in the interval from 8,000 to over 20,000 has proportionately increased its defectiveness. This Committee of 1868 recommended the introduction of superior officers with qualifiea-tions similar to those to be found in officers of other departments of the public service and outside professions, and the need for this has been reiterated by subsequent Committees and Commissions, but the 1829 plan of filling all superior posts by promotion of those who joined as constables has remained unchanged. As stated in the Commissioner&apos;s Report, it was condemned as recently as 1929 by the Royal Commission on Police Powers and Procedure, who stated emphatically that it was inimical to the public interest. The need for better qualified men for the higher posts in the Police service has in fact been stressed over .and over again in recent years and was the main reason for the scheme considered in 1930 by a Sub-Committee of the Police Council, representing both the authorities and the men, for the establishment of a Police College.In order to present a clear picture of the new scheme now to be brought into force, a brief outline of the existing organisation is necessary.The existing establishment of the Metropolitan Police Force is as follows: 1 Commissioner. 1 Deputy Commissioner. 3 Assistant Commissioners. 3 Deputy Assistant Commissioners. 7 Chief Constables. 33 Superintendents. 38 Chief Inspectors. 154 Sub-Divisional Inspectors.(x) 547 Inspectors. (*) 610 Station Sergeants^1) 2,211 Sergeants. 0) 16,789 Constables.20,397The Metropolitan Police Area is divided into four Districts, each in charge of a Deputy Assistant Commissioner or Chief Constable, and into twenty-three Divisions, each in charge of a Superintendent,(&apos;) Including corresponding g.I.D. ranks.
witli a Chief Inspector as his second in command. Each Division is divided into a number of Sub-Divisions (under Sub-Divisional Inspectors), and each Sub-Division comprises a number of Stations, usually under an Inspector. The Criminal Investigation Department has its own separate organisation, and although the Deputy Assistant Commissioners or Chief Constables in charge of Districts have some responsibility for the C.I.D. officers under them, those officers are mainly answerable to C.I.D. officers called &quot; Area Superintendents &quot; at Scotland Yard, each of whom has special charge of the criminal work of a District.The existing organisation of four Districts and twenty-three Divisions will remain unchanged, but the number of higher posts in each rank will require adjustment, and measures will need to be taken to modify the present division of supervisory responsibility so as to secure a higher degree of co-ordination between C.I.D. and uniform work.As already indicated, the men required for the higher ranks will be obtained partly from the Force itself and partly from outside the service by recruitment from the universities, public schools and secondary schools. Candidates from outside the Force will be required to take a competitive educational examination, unless they can show that they have already reached a standard of education which makes this unnecessary. Candidates from within the Force will either take the same examination, or may be exempted from it if their educational attainments are not up to the standard of the examination, but they are otherwise suitable for appointment to the higher posts. All candidates will appear before a Selection Board which will examine their past records and assess their qualifications, and in all selections, whether from the Force or from outside, weight will be given not only to educational qualifications, but to the other attributes of a good police officer.The initial training of selected candidates, whether from the Force or from outside, will be carried out in a Police College, which will be established for the purpose in the outskirts of London. The whole training will last for approximately two years, during which time there will be two or three examinations to test the candidate^ progress and his suitability for eventual appointment. The course will include a period of work as a uniform constable.It is hoped that it may be possible to set up the Police School for the training of constables alongside the new College. The present school at Peel House, Westminster, has been inadequate for some time, and efforts have been made to find either a suitable site for a new building or an existing building which could be adapted for the purpose. Peel House is not only deficient in residential accommodation and cramped as regards space for indoor instruction, but is also without facilities for outdoor work, exercise or games. There is good reason to think that it will be possible to secure a suitable property within easy reach of the centre of London which can be adapted for the twofold purpose without great expenditure.
On passing the final test and leaving the college, the candidate will; be appointed- on probation to &quot;the rank of &quot;Junior Station Inspector&quot;- a new grade to be introduced for this special purpose.There are at. present, as shown above, 547 Inspectors oil the establishment. It is intended to. sub-divide this number into three ranks with - the . titles of &quot;Junior: Station Inspector,&quot; &quot;Station Inspector &quot; and &quot;Inspector.&quot; Prom the Junior Station Inspector-ship the new officer will rise.in a few!years to a Station Inspector-ship. Further promotion, to the higher ranks will be by selection. The rank of Inspector will be in future the highest grade normally attainable by the man who joins the Force as an ordinary constable, hut he will, of course, be eligible, if suitable, for appointment to the Police College and a career in the higher ranks.An important feature of the new system will be that there will -be no hard and -fast separation of officers as between C.I.D.-and uniform work. There will be only one list for both branches. Every officer will be given, during his training, opportunities of - studying subjects relating, to , these two main divisions of police work, and -his original assignment to the C.I.D. or uniform, side will depend to some extent on. the nature of his special capacities, but he will not necessarily remain permanently in. one branch or the other. It is intended to afford-the widest possible experience to each officer in his early days and to postpone his permanent allocation to particular duties until experience shows- for what type of work he is best fitted. In this way the marked line .of cleavage which at present exists between the C.I.D. and uniform branches will gradually disappear.Men recruited under the new system will also be considered for appointment to posts at present occupied by the civil staff at Scotland Yard, and members of the civil staff who show the necessary capacity for police work will be eligible for appointment as police officers.The annual intake of candidates, both from the force and from outside, will be between 30 and 40, and, eventually, when the scheme is in full, operation, this number will, it is calculated, be sufficient to fill all the posts of Station Inspector and upwards. Many years must elapse before the new scheme can take full effect, and in the meantime the existing system of filling, the higher posts will continue.Much consideration has been given to the effect of the scheme.on the . prospects of men already, in the. Force who have qualified :for promotion or are about to do so. It is clearly necessary, to take all proper steps to ensure that these men will not be penalised by the . alteration of system. ...It. will be obvious that the flow of promotion will not be affected until the new men begin to take up their appointments as Junior Station Inspectors, which will not be until after the expiration of between two and three years. After that time, in the absence of any compensating factor, the number of higher posts available in ,the normal course of promotion to men who enter the Force-as constables would tend to become, gradually less. . This tendency will,
however, be counteracted by two changes bearing in the opposite direction. In the first place, it is proposed to increase the number of higher posts, more particularly in the rank of Chief Inspector. It is intended to provide an officer of this grade to take charge of the crime work in each Division, and this and other proposals affecting the rank will involve almost doubling the number of Chief Inspectors in the Force. In the second place, it is intended to require senior officers who have reached a certain age or have occupied their posts for more than a stated period of years to retire on pension.The effect of both these changes will be to increase the flow of promotion. It is impossible to estimate at this stage precisely to what extent they will offset the effect of the direct appointments, but the position will be carefully watched and every effort will be made to safeguard the interests of those who have joined the Force on the existing terms and qualify for promotion.The new scheme will involve an increase in the number of higher posts both at Headquarters and in the Districts and Divisions.At Headquarters the number of. higher posts has not kept pace with the growth of the Force or the increased complexity of modern police work. The amount of current business which has to be dealt with from day to day fully occupies the energies of the existing staff. The initiation and development of new measures are neglected or have to be indefinitely postponed because there is not the time or opportunity to deal with them. The Organisation Department which started work early in 1932 has done a great deal, but it was formed in the main merely by a rearrangement of duties and without any material addition to the total strength at Headquarters, and it has already enough work in hand to keep it fully occupied for a considerable period.But it is by no means only in these respects that the need for more central control is felt. Instances come to notice constantly of directions in which supervision is lacking, and many of them fall under the head of ordinary administration.There are, for example, in the Metropolitan area, 115 Section Houses which are the homes of a fifth of the Force, and in which they eat and sleep and take their recreation. It is obviously of the greatest importance that an organisation which assumes this responsi-bility of housing a large section of its personnel should use every possible means to secure not only that they are well housed, but that life in the Section House is made as pleasant and as comfortable as possible. There is, however, no one at Scotland Yard who has the necessary time to supervise and direct local efforts for this purpose and ensure something in the nature of a common standard of amenity.Another example which might be mentioned is the use of wireless. The development of this has been left almost entirely in the hands of the technical experts, whereas it should also, from the police side, be in the charge of those whose business it is to study the application of [8563] b 8
resources of this kind to the prevention and detection of crime and similar problems, and thus secure the best possible use of the available equipment in the varying circumstances that arise. The same remarks apply to a great extent to the organisation and control of transport.Another matter that has been neglected, largely on account of lack of staff to deal with it, is the higher specialist training of police officers and development of police methods. This sphere of activity undoubtedly requires the constant attention of a highly qualified officer with a wide knowledge of police work and of the best methods of imparting instruction. Other examples could be given to illustrate the need for reinforcement of the headquarters staff, and, in particular, the intermediate grades.Similarly, in the Districts and Divisions more supervision is necessary. The Metropolitan area covers 700 square miles. It is approximately 30 miles from North to South and 30 miles from East to West. The Deputy Assistant Commissioner or Chief Constable in charge of a . District has for his personal staff only - one civilian clerk. With such a staff he cannot hope to deal with a large amount of office work if at the same time he has to keep in close personal touch with his senior officers and to supervise the efficiency and welfare of the 5,000 men under him. At the present time two of the Districts are in charge of Deputy Assistant Commissioners and two in charge of Chief Constables. It is intended to place a Deputy Assistant Commissioner in charge of each District with the assistance of a Chief Constable (as his second in command) and a Chief Inspector. Only by constantly visiting individual stations and discussing the various problems that arise with the officers in immediate daily contact with them can these senior officers hope to exercise effective control. In a County or Borough Force of less than half the size of one District in London the Chief Constable would have a Deputy Chief Constable to assist him, and, although the responsibilities are admittedly different in many respects, there can be no doubt that the proposed increase is fully justified by the &apos; requirements of the work.A substantial increase in the establishment of Chief Inspectors is also .necessary as already indicated in order that in each Division the Superintendent may have the assistance of an additional Chief Inspector charged with the special duty of organising and directing the crime work of the Division. He will not be much concerned with the investigation of individual cases, but it will be his business to know precisely, and from clay to day, what types of crime are&apos; being committed in his Division, and in which particular localities,&apos; and at what hour of the day or night, they are most prevalent. He will be,. as it were, the local crime intelligence officer. He will study the possibility of meeting each new development with suitable counter-measures, and it will be his special object to infuse energy and keenness into his men.
There is a tendency at present to concentrate mainly on dealing with crimes separately as they occur. The investigation of individual occurrences and the pursuit of individual criminals must, necessarily occupy much time and energy, and the. result is, that the importance of continually studying, the problem as a whole is liable; to-be neglected. Efficiency in this department of police work will, be greatly increased if there are, both at Headquarters and in, the Divisions, officers whose special task it. is to examine statistics, to map crime and study its local incidence,: to evolve and test new ideas and, generally, to keep the organisation and methods under constant review..,   ,Reference has already been made to the conditions of retirement. Under the existing system, officers from the Inspector rank upwards  who constitute the controlling body of the Force-are eligible to continue in the service until they reach the age of 60 or 65. .From several points of view this system is unsatisfactory. In the first place it has the effect of blocking promotion and preventing keen, and ambitious young officers from securing positions ,of responsibility at the age of maximum energy and efficiency. In the second place it tends to an undue disparity of ages between the supervising grades and the men under their control. In order to secure, real &quot;touch &quot; and understanding between senior and junior ranks, it..is essential that a reasonable proportion of the higher posts should be held by men still young in age and young in outlook. The work of a Sub-Divisional Inspector, for example (who has about 200 to 250 men under him), is not in general best carried out by men who are already well advanced in middle life. Not only are they apt to have lost personal keenness and driving force, but they may to some extent be out of sympathy with the point of view of the younger men.For these reasons it has been decided to provide for a wider variation than exists at present in the compulsory retiring ages. of. the different ranks, and power will be sought to enable officers, of and above the rank of Inspector to be retired on pensions pro-portionate to their service, on reaching such age, not being less than forty-five, as the Secretary of State may from time to time determine in relation to the respective ranks. The new provision-like the present provision should allow of exceptions. It will not in ,any event apply to officers now in the Force.  . -The position of the new officers in relation to the Police Federation has called for special consideration. . Under the Police Act of 1919 all officers below the rank of Superintendent are automatically members of the Federation, and, in every force, there is a branch board for Inspectors, as well as one for Sergeants. and one for Constables. The three Boards have power to sit together, and in. the Metropolitan Force there is a Joint Executive Committee composed of the Executive Committees of the three Boards, which meets regularly and makes representations to the Commissioner and the Secretary of State on a variety of matters.
It is neitlier necessary nor consistent with the position which the new officers are i intended to occupy in the Force that they should form part of an organisation set up because the normal channels of ventilating grievances and making representations were not regarded as adequate. This is one of the defects which the new scheme aims at removing. It is designed to secure that men shall be&apos; able to count on the advice and help of their officers on matters affecting their collective or individual welfare. This is hardly consistent with officers and men sitting together on Boards and Committees to formulate representations to the authorities. For these reasons it is proposed that the Police Act, 1919, shall be amended so as to provide for the exclusion from the Police Federation of the men who have been trained in the College for a career in the higher ranks. As a corollary to this provision it will be necessary also to provide for the exclusion from the Federation of the two existing grades of Chief Inspector and Sub-Divisional Inspector which will be of superior rank to the new grades of Station Inspector and Junior Station Inspector.Appendix II.. The Absence of Incentive in the case of Long-Service Constables who have passed their turn for Promotion.It is not generally realised what a large number of constables in the Metropolitan Police Force are men of considerable service with no prospect of promotion.In order to qualify for promotion a Metropolitan police constable is required to pass an examination within eight years of his appoint-ment, and those who fail or do not try -to do this remain in the constable grade for the rest of their service.The result is that, in the Metropolitan Force, there are about 8,000 constables, or nearly half the total number in this rank, who have lost all prospect of promotion, and have nothing to look forward to except their pensions. At the present time about 4,000 of these men have over seventeen years&apos; service, and before long, the average length of service of constables will be substantially greater than it is now.Police duties are many and varied. Some of them, for example, detective or special enquiry work, are of special interest, whilst others, and particularly beat duty, tend to be monotonous. Constables on beat duty should be physically and mentally equipped to deal with any exceptional occurrence that may arise; but, in the normal course, such- occasions are few and far between, and in many cases a constable on beat duty may-carry out his appointed task for long periods without encountering a single incident which calls for rapid thought or action. In such circum-stances it would be asking too much of human nature to expect that a constable who has long years of service before him with nothing
to look forward to in the way of promotion, should not be affected by the dullness of his occupation, and should continue indefinitely to work at it with energy and keenness.It is not suggested that even under conditions so inimical to efficiency constables fail to carry out their duty or consciously avoid effort when effort is required. No blame attaches to the men. The fault is with the system. As it stands at present, the system is unfair to the men. What is even more important it is unfair to the public to ask them to pay for a Force which is not giving the best possible value in protection and service.In smaller police forces, and especially in the county forces, where the constable is often the sole representative of the Force on the spot for all police purposes, the work is less specialised, and beat duty is combined with enquiries and work of other kinds, the admixture of which lends interest to his occupation. So far as possible every effort is being and will be made to provide this kind of stimulus in the Metropolitan Police, and to devise means of reducing the routine performance of the same duty day after day within the smallest possible limits. But in police forces, as in business organisations, the larger the organisation the greater is the need, in the interest of efficiency and economy, for the application of the principle of division of labour. For this reason it has been found essential in the Metropolitan Police to allocate individuals more than in other Forces to separate and specialised duties, particularly those concerned with the detection of crime, with special enquiry work, and with traffic patrols. The problem, therefore, which the Government have had to face is how, in such circum-stances, the adverse effect on police efficiency of the deadening influence of beat duty, unrelieved by any considerable admixture of other work, can best be counteracted. After close study of the special problems presented by the peculiar conditions of police work in the Metropolis, and bearing in mind that success depends on the keenness and initiative of a force of police constables acting more or less independently and frequently without close supervision, the Government have reached the conclusion that the (Only effective solution lies in the introduction of a system for the employment of a proportion of the Metropolitan police constables on short-service engagements. The consequences of this arrangement will be twofold. It will have the effect of reducing considerably the average age of the constable grade, and the length of time which will be spent by any individual constable on routine work. It offers also the ancillary advantage of improving the career of constables who join the Police Service with the object of making it their life career, by propor-tionately increasing their chances of promotion to the higher posts.The Government have accordingly decided that a proportion of the Force shall be recruited on short-service engagements for a period of ten years, and that at the end of that time they shall retire with a gratuity calculated on the basis of one month&apos;s pay for every completed year of service.   They will contribute to this gratuity by
means of the usual&apos; statutory- 5 per cent, deduction from their pay, which will be returnable in the event of resignation before completion of ten years&apos; service. The number so to be recruited will be sufficient to ensure eventually that at any moment about one quarter of the Force, viz., 5,000 men, will be men on short-service engagements. The method of recruitment and the scale of pay will be the same as for the men recruited on the ordinary terms, but a short-service engagement will not be regarded as a stepping-stone to long service, and a. constable once recruited on this basis will not be eligible for transfer to the other. The duties carried out will be those of a uniform constable.It is appreciated that this scheme will be criticised as a new departure so far as the police are concerned, on the ground that the policeman, unlike the soldier, the sailor and the airman, has always regarded his employment as his life&apos;s career. It may also be urged against the scheme that short-service constables will find it difficult to secure employment after they retire from the Force, and that it is contrary to modern principles for the Government to add to the number of blind-alley occupations.If it seemed probable that the short-service scheme would have the effect of adding to the ranks of the unemployed the whole or any substantial proportion of the 500 men who would normally retire annually when the system comes into full operation, such a result would, admittedly be a substantial drawback to the plan.But there is good reason to believe that the result would be far otherwise. A large field for employment should normally be open to men with precisely the qualities and training that 10 years&apos; service in a jrolice force provides. Even under the present system a considerable number of ex-police constables obtain work of various kinds after they leave the service with a pension in middle age. Government Departments, museums, banks and many other business houses require the services of men of good character and physique who have been specially selected and trained in habits of watchfulness and resource, and there should be no insuperable difficulty in securing a large number of the vacancies in these fields of employment for the discharged short-service constables.It is intended, as part of the scheme, to set up a special Appoint-ments Board at Scotland Yard, whose duty it will be to keep in touch with outside employers with the object of obtaining suitable posts for those retiring annually.This arrangement will incidentally provide a strong incentive to the short-service man to earn, by zeal and good conduct, the best possible recommendations, so that, when he retires, he may be given the pick of the available vacancies.. It has been suggested that the contingent prospect of a pension acts as a necessary guarantee of good conduct and discipline in a police force, and that the withdrawal of this prospect will remove a strong incentive to faithful service and correct behaviour.   There is
force in this argument. The prospect of a pension is no doubt a steadying influence, but so also will be the consciousness in the mind of the short-service man that his prospect of subsequent employment depends largely on the character he earns during his period of police service.No possible solution is wholly free from objection, but after full examination of the problem in all its aspects, the Government are satisfied that such difficulties as may arise will be more than offset by the increase in the general standard of efficiency resulting from a substantial reduction in the average age of the rank and file of the Force and in the length of the period spent by individual constables on routine work.Appendix III.The System under ivhich Police are employed and -paid by Private Persons to act as Police Officers on -private premises or for private purposes in their own time; and the Acceptance of, Monetary Payments in connexion with Ordinary Police Work.In the opening Chapter of his Annual Report, Lord Trenchard gives an account of the system of &quot; employment on gratuity,&quot; under which members of the Metropolitan Police Force are employed as police officers in their spare time by private persons and receive direct payment for their services, and expresses the view that a revision of the system has become necessary.After careful consideration, the conclusion has been reached that the only possible solution is to put a definite end. to the present arrangement and to bring the practice of the Metropolitan police into line with that of other forces, and with the statutory regulation governing the matter which was based on the recommendation of the Desborough Committee that police employed at the cost of \ rivatf: persons should not receive from them any special payment in consideration of services rendered. This regulation allows for pay-ment in respect of extended hours of duty and prescribes. that &apos;&apos; payments so due shall be made by the police authority and recovered from the person or persons for whose benefit the constable is employed.&quot;It has accordingly been decided that, after a given date, employers needing the services of police shall make application at a local Station. If the employment is one for which the use of police may properly be allowed and the men asked for are available, they will be provided, and the employer will be required, to pay for their services in accordance with the scale laid down, the payment being made to the Police Fund and not to the men themselves. In cases where the special duty involves an extension of the ordinary tour of duty, the officer or officers concerned will receive payment in accordance with the rule governing the payment of overtime as well as any refreshment allowance that may be due,
Lord Trenchard has further called attention to the fact that from time to time sums of money are presented to officers of the Force by Football Clubs and other organisations and by private persons in recognition of the manner in which police duties have been carried out on some occasion or during a particular, period. Alternatively, the money may be sent to Divisions or Stations for distribution amongst the officers concerned. In practice men in well-to-do districts are apt to receive more from these sources than those in the poorer areas.The acceptance of such gifts would not appear to be in accordance with the best interests of the Force, or consistent with the conception of police service as a &quot;profession.&quot;The Commissioner has therefore decided, after consultation with the Home Secretary, to issue a general appeal to members of the public who desire to express their satisfaction with the work of the Metropolitan Police by means of monetary payments, to send their contributions to a central &quot; Commissioners Fund &quot; rather than to local Stations or to individual officers. Any sums so received would be distributed for the benefit of the Force as a whole in the form of grants to police charities and of assistance to athletics.Appendix IV.The large Expenditure of Official Time on Meetings of Branch Boards and Committees, and the Circulation of Branch Board Documents.Under the provisions of the Police Act, 1919, the members of each police force below the rank of Superintendent form a Branch of the Police Federation, and breach police force there are three Branch Boards one for Constables, one for Sergeants and one for Inspectors. It is laid down in the Act that Branch Boards may hold four quarterly meetings in the year, and that additional meetings for any special purpose may be held with the consent of the Chief Officer of Police. Provision is also made for the three Branch Boards or any two of them to sit together as one Board, and for the appoint-ment of Committees or Sub-Committees.In the case of the Metropolitan Police, the requirements of the Act have been greatly exceeded. It is calculated that in the course of a year approximately 480 meetings are held in official time, most of them lasting for a whole working day. So far as can be ascertained, in no other police force has it been found necessary to hold meetings so many in excess of the number prescribed by the Act; and the Government are satisfied that the objects for which the Branch Boards were instituted can be effectively achieved without any such elaborate programme of meetings.
It has accordingly been decided that the future arrangements shall be as follows : (1) Central Meetings.In addition to the Branch Board meetings prescribed by the Act (i.e., four per annum for each Board), there shall be : (a) Executive Committee meetings once a quarter (instead of, as at present, two per month), with the proviso that extra meetings may be allowed occasionally with the Commis-sioner&apos;s permission for special purposes.(b) Joint Executive Committee meetings twice a year.There will then be every year (if required) Pour meetings of the Inspectors&apos; Branch Board. Four meetings of the Sergeants&apos; Branch Board. Four meetings of the Constables&apos; Branch Board. Four meetings of the Inspectors&apos; Executive Committee.&apos; Four meetings of the Sergeants&apos; Executive Committee. Four meetings of the Constables&apos; Executive Committee. Two meetings of the Joint Executive Committee.(2) Divisional Committee Meetings.Meetings of Sergeants&apos; Divisional Committees and Constables&apos; Divisional Committees will be allowed once every six months instead of once a month. Under this arrangement it will be possible for over 100 Divisional meetings to be held in the course of a year.Under existing arrangements it is the practice to print and circulate the minutes of the various meetings of the Boards and Committees for the information of the Force. Long argumentative resolutions on matters which have frequently been decided by the Government, the Secretary of State or the Commissioner, are thus given wide publicity, and members of the Force are liable in consequence to obtain a one-sided view of the questions dealt with. The Commissioner, after consultation with the Home Secretary, has decided that for the future, in so far as it is necessary to inform the Force of representations submitted to the authorities by the Boards and Committees, the gist of the resolutions received and of the answers given shall be duly published in Police Orders.
Appendix V.The Question of &apos;&apos; Amenities &apos;&apos; and the Provision of Recreation and Club-House Facilities for the Force.Reference is made in the opening Chapter of the Commissioners Annual Report to the importance, in the interest of the welfare and efficiency of the Force under his control, of improving its facilities for indoor and outdoor recreation. The Commissioner. has already received generous assistance for this purpose from certain friends of the Metropolitan Police.The object to be aimed at is to secure that, eventually, there shall be within reasonable reach of every member of the Force some place belonging to the Force itself where he will be able to spend his off-duty time in healthy and congenial surroundings, and will be provided with facilities for reading, writing and playing games both indoors and outdoors. The House has already been informed, in reply to a Question on the 80th March last, of the acquisition of the Leyton Cricket Ground, and it is hoped that eventually there may be in each of the 4 Districts a suitable ground and club-house.The Government fully recognise the need for improving the recreational facilities available to the Metropolitan Police, and specific provision will be made for this purpose so soon as. the financial position allows.Wt,-S 30 70 5/33 F.O.P. 8563 Gp. 340
