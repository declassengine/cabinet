The variations in the divisions were-London, South Eastern and South Western - 50,007North Eastern North Western Scotland .. Wales .....q    o    i    o    pc* 0    C    O* *     *    ft. . - 16,975 ml o i i 9 *        2*359*    8,307o   a   o  *   0   *  bInsured workers in employment on the 24th April are estimated to have numbered approximately 9,534,000, an increase of 91,000 compared with the previous month and of 92,000 compared with a year ago.     The improvement occurred chiefly in the building, distributive and clothing industries.     There was also some improvement in public works contracting, bricic, tile and cement manufacture, stone quarrying, hotel, boarding house and laundry services,  engineering, iron- minding, ship-building and ship repairing and in the vehicle, furniture, woodworking, food and drink industries, in transport services and in electric cable and apparatus manufacture.     There was a decline in coal mining,  in the cotton,  linen, jute and hosiery industries,  in textile bleaching, dyeing and finishing and in the iron and steel, tin plate, boot and shoe and pottery industries.Overseas Trade -   Imports in April, 1933, were  51,151,000 compared with  53,555,000 in April,  1932.     Exports of United Kingdom produce and manufactures were  26,395,000 compared with  34,782,000j    exports of imported merchandise were  3,538,000 compa red with  4,641,000.
The excess of imports over exports of merchandise, was  81,218,000 compared with  14,132,000 In 1932.     The net imports of bullion and specie amounted to  16,282,000.Rail and Road Traffic -   During the four weeks ended 30th April,  1933,  the railway traffic receipts were  181,000 (l,66$) less than in the corresponding period, of 1932.      (The comparison is affected by   the fact that in 1933 Easter fell in April).     Passenger traffic showed an increase of 15.06$, while merchandise, minerals and livestock showed a decrease of 10.20$, and coal, coke and patent fuel a decrease of 18.23$.New registrations of motor cycles in March,  1933, compared with March, 1932,  showed a decrease of 2,269 (31.3$) while registrations of other motor vehicles increased by 5,250 (22.3$), comprising an increase of 5,325 private cars and a decrease of 73 commercial and other vehicles,Ooal -   The average weekly output for the 13 weeks ended April 22nd,  1933, was 4,203,000 tons which was 2.8$ less than in the corresponding period in the previous year, and 6.4$ less than in 1931.The average employment for the 13 weeks ending April 22nd, was 790,200 compared with 835,000 in the corresponding period in 1932.     The weekly output per person was 5.42 tons, which was 0.14 tons greater than in the corresponding period in 1932.Coal exports for the three months ended March, 1933, compared with the corresponding period of 1932 showed a decrease of 35,000 tons, while bunker coal showed a decrease of 412,000 tons.     An increase was shown in the exports from the South Wales and North Eastern districts, but elsewhere there were decreases.Iron and Steel -   Conditions remained quiet but steady during April.     The export trade showed more activity although    t in certain markets buyers were restricted owing to the uncertainty of the exchange situation.     The export trade in
pig iron remained poor, but domestic demand was slightly better.Continental competition in semi-finished material in the United Kingdom is now small and certain prodxxcers have recently withdrawn from the.market pending final negotiations for the International Steel Cartel.     The present arrangement is that international selling associations are to come into operation on June 1st, to control export prices and sales of semi-finished material, joists,  sheet bars, merchant bars and medium and heavy plates.The position in Scotland was practically unchanged, the demand for shipbuilding material being still small.     A number of the smaller engineering works were busy on machinery for India.     On the North-East Coast there was some improvement and substantial orders for rails and railway wagon material were received.     Contracts for the Danish bridge and the Pulham Power Station were -made.      In South Wales there was no improve-ment.     Business in Sheffield maintained its activity with some improvement in special steels.Shipping and Shipbuilding: -   The position was substantially unchanged.      The index number of shipping freights (1913 ^ 100) for April,  1933, was 73.76 compared with 86.79 in April,  1932.&quot;Electrical Industry -.  The output of electricity by authorised undertakings in April,  1933, was 952 million units compared with 988 million units in April,  1932,  a decrease of 3.6$.      For the first 4 months of the year there was an increase of 5.1fj.-The percentage of productive capacity for plant in use rose during the month to over. 50$ owing to a slight increase in export orders.Motor Industry -   The home demand for private cars was well maintained.     As regards commercial vehicles,  the increased taxation announced in the Budget and the licensing system put forward in the Road and Rail Transport Bill exerted a
depressing influence.In the export markets there was some hesitation on the part of distributors, who were uncertain as to the possible &apos; effect of the United States&apos; departure from the gold standard.Machine Tools -   The slight improvement in the home market visible in March was continued during April.Exports amounted to  99,000 compared with  553*000 in April, 1932.     Of this, exports to Russia accounted for  44,000 compared with  497,H00 in April,  1932.     No new Russian orders are now being booked, and it is feared that the new Russian Trade Agreement with Italy and the depreciation of the dollar will further diminish British exports of machine tools.Imports of machine tools during April were  43,000, compared with  70,000 in the same month of the previous year.Cotton -   Activity in the cotton industry in April was influenced by the voluntary stoppage of spinning during the week after Easter.     Raw cotton prices were firmer and prices of American and Egyptian cotton were higher than in the corresponding period of last year.     Indian cotton remained cheaper than in 1932,     Deliveries of raw cotton to spinners fell in April to 22.7 million lbs. per week compared with 27.6 million lbs. a year ago.Yarn production continued at the same weekly level in April as in March.     Exports of cotton piece goods were well maintained up to the end of March, but in April fell below the figures for the corresponding month of 1932.Silk, and Artificial SilK -   Business in real silk in March was slow owing to the drop in demand from the American market.     In rayon the improvement during 1932 has not continued.     Japanese rayon piece goods continue to flood the Empire markets;    the Japanese exports to India in 1932 exceeded the British exports to the whole world.i4*&quot;
Building Industry -   There has been some improvement in the building industry since the end of February, hut this is largely the normal seasonal trend.     The percentage of unemployment remains very high.There is a shortage of bricks owing to the restriction of production of last winter.     Uncertainty regarding the timber position is causing anxiety and it is feared that it may react adversely on housing schemes.Other Industries - The home demand for motor tyres remained . steady, while the demand for pedal c7/cle tyres was abnormally large.      In rubber footwear the home situation improved as a result of the new import duties.     Margarine consumption declined further since butter reached the low level of 3d. a lb. in April, Trade in edible oils and fats was at the usual level, but forward business was slow.     Trade in chemicals showed some improvement. The home demand for fertilisers was good.     Abroad,  the Spanish demand fell owing to the restrictions placed on imports of products such as oranges and rice by various consuming countries.Finance and Banking -   (a) London.     The abandonment of the gold standard by the United States had little effect on the money market except to weaken rates still further.     This was accentuated by the flight of Continental capital to London, causing a rise in sterling which was later checked by the announcement of the French Treasury&apos;s borrowing of  30 million in London.The Danish loan floated during the month was the first public offer of this kind since the embargo on foreign issues was imposed.(&quot;k) United^ States.,     On leaving the gold standard the dollar, after an initial fall, fluctuated between $3.75 and $3,95 to the  .     Money rates eased, and the price oi Government securities improved.
9 -I o(c) France.     The fall of the dollar led to fears that the Exchange Equalisation Fund might convert its franc holdingsinto gold.      The position was eased by the grant of a  30 million credit for 3-6 months to the French Treasury.     This has had the effect of staying the flight to the pound.(d) Germany. The Berlin money market showed little change. RetailTrade -   The value of sales decreased by 2.9$ inMarch,  1933,  compared with March, 1932.     This figure was made up of a decrease of 2.9$ in the food departments and of 2.8$ in the non-food departments.      (The comparison with 1932 is affected by the fact that Easter fell in March in that year).The decrease in total sales was 4.2$ in London (West&apos;End), 1.7$ in London (Suburban), 2.3$ in the South of England, 3.5$ in the north, and 2.2$ in Scotland.     Increased sales were recorded for piece goods, boots and shoes, and hardware.     Stocks showed a reduction of 7.4$ on last year.In departmental stores alone trade in March compared with the previous year shoved a reduction in Great Britain of 3.9$, in the United States of 27$, and in Germany of 13.6$.Indian.Trade -   Imports in March, 1933, amounted to 1,087 lakhs of rupees compared with 1,091 in March, 1932, while exports were 1,266 compared with 1,323.      Net exports of gold were 488 laKhs compared -dth 674.Returns for the financial year 1932/35 show that imports were 132 crores of rupees and exports 135,  compared with 125 and 160 respectively in 1931/32.     Net exports of gold were 65 crores compared with 58,  and the balance of trade in India&apos;s favour fell from 90 to 68 crores.Canadian Trade -   The chief feature of the economic position in March was a rise in wholesale prices.     The index moved from 63.6 in February to 64.4 in March, and further advances occurred during April in many commodities.     The index for farm products advanced from 43.0 to 4-4.7.
Australian Trade -   For the nine months ended March, 1933, imports were  56,097,000 and exports  97,730,000 compared with  41,526,000 and  30,431,000, respectively, in the corresponding periods of 1931/2.
