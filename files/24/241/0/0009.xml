THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. .May 1933.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 129 (33).CABINET.I CIRCULATE, for the information of my colleagues, a memorandum on the foreign policy of the present German Government.J. S.May 16, 1933.THE FOREIGN  POLICY OF  THE PRESENT  GERMANGOVERNMENT.Sir H. Rumbold, in his despatch No. 425 (which has been circulated to the Cabinet), has analysed the tendencies of the Nazi Government of Germany in the domain of foreign policy, and has, after a three months&apos; study, come to the conclusion that the definite policy which the German Government is now pursuing is to bring Germany to a point of preparation, a jumping-off point from which she can reach solid ground before her adversaries can interfere, and to do all this without violating articles 173 to 179 (Chapter III : Recruiting and Military Training) of the treaty. This is the only interpretation that he can place on the concrete measures which are now being taken. When these various measures have had time to come into operation thorough arrangements will have been created to inculcate discipline, to improve the physical condition and to give instruction in many forms of military training. The process will be applied continuously from the age of 12 till the men become too old for service in the field, and a supply of instructors and an organisation to handle complete classes of the nation, quite independent of the Reichswehr, will have been created. The cumulative effect of these measures will be to produce a very large reserve of personnel who will require little further training to take their places in the armed forces of the country on the outbreak of war.Thus the spirit of the moment is definitely disquieting, and the Government of Germany, for the first time since the war, are giving State sanction and encouragement to an attitude of mind, as well as to various forms of military training, which can only end in one way. Sir H. Rumbold, therefore, feels that Germany&apos;s neighbours have reason to be vigilant, and that it may be necessary for them to determine their attitude towards coming developments in that country sooner than they may have contemplated.What, one may ask, are these developments likely to be ? The possibilities would seem to be threefold, unless, of course, there is a change of heart in the present regime : 1. Collapse of Hitler through economic failure, followed by either a militarydictatorship (which might well be short-lived) or Bolshevism. 2. A preventive war on Germany, before Germany is strong enough toattack anyone else, as she will if Hitler succeeds.   This, in the caseof France at. least, seems unlikely. 3. Success of Hitler, followed. if present Nazi dispositions are maintained by a European war in four or five years&apos; time. 4. A possible peaceful evolution on the Italian model, though this seems lessprobable, seeing how widely different are the circumstances of the twocountries.6886   [8605]B
For the moment we are concerned only- with possibility No. 3. Assuming Hitler consolidation, Sir H. Rumbqld foresees that as time elapses it will be increasingly difficult to ascertain what is actually taking place in this country and to gauge the real intentions of the German Government. About the intentions of the National Socialist party itself there is no secret. Since the victory of the 5th March hopes have been kindled which will not be readily extinguished. To quote the words of the ober prasident of the Frontier Province at a mass demonstration which took place in the frontier town of Scheidemuhl on the 13th ultimo : &quot; We are listening intently and waiting full of hope and faith to see whether in our time the resurgence of the nation will be followed by a moral and actual onslaught on the German East. To attain the goal, to restore German land and German men to mother Germany, we need the whole German people for a crusade of the nation towards the East. What we have lost must not remain lost.&quot; German Ministers and officials have brought the task of concealing jingoism in harmless language to a high art, and the ober prasident was presumably merely trying to say that he hoped that the new Germany would go to war, with Poland at the earliest possible moment.Since Sir H. Rumbold wrote his despatch the German Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Vice-Chancellor, von Papen, have both made important pronouncements, which leave little doubt as to the policy which the German /Government intend to follow. Herr von Neurath&apos;s statement, given in an article in the German League of Nations Union News Service on the 11th May, may be summarised as follows : &apos; - No disarmament agreement can be accepted by Germany which does hot give practical realisation to the principle of equality of status.   The German claim to such equality through the disarmament of others has broken down through the unwillingness of the highly-armed States to disarm, and r   &apos; any disarmament agreement reached within the framework of the English plan will compel Germany to supplement her armaments.   Since the air arm will not be abolished, nor guns above 105 mm. calibre forbidden and -destroyed, Germany must for her security build a military and naval air ; force and provide herself with heavy artillery.    The same applies to &apos;&quot; &apos;    effectives.      Germany cannot dispense with armaments held to be necessary &quot;for the security of others, and if no disarmament agreement be reached and the full sovereignty of States be thus upheld as a principle, it will hold good - in the same manner for Germany, whose freedom and right to live cannot be determined by a different measure to that applied to others.&quot;Herr von Papen, speaking on the 14th May, in answer to Lord Hailsham&apos;s statement in the House of Lords on the 11th May, used the following words :-&quot; Talk of sanctions against a Power conducting a moral struggle against immoral treaties is. hypocrisy, since no measures have been taken against Powers which abandoned moral protests and went to war.  Germany, which has suffered every sort of calamity, will not close its eyes to the situation with which the outer world has confronted it.   The outer world will (on the 17th instant) learn of Germany&apos;s intentions and thereafter understand that, a great nation can only be robbed by force for a short time of its birthright. Germans must explain why they have removed the word &apos; pacifism &apos; from their vocabulary, and prove that the anti-pacifist campaign is not synonymous with warlike intentions.   Pacifist literature teaches that a slow decline is &apos;     : preferable to an honourable death in the field, and that the spirit in which men died is less important than the ugliness of violent death.   &apos; What the battlefield is for men, motherhood is for women &apos; and therefore, since the maintenance of eternal life-means the sacrifice of the individual,&apos; mothers ;. must give life to children, to secure whose future the fathers must fight oh the battlefield.&quot;. &apos; If J quote these pronouncements, it. is merely as.outstanding examples of the sort of speeches and, articles now emanating from German Ministers, officials and publicists- as part of the system of organised Nazi, propaganda. For &quot;Ait must be remembered that propaganda in the view of the Nazis is an :- all-important instrument of, policy,;,,and ..indeed, a Ministry of Propaganda has been expressly created &quot;in Berlin for this purpose. ..Nor&apos;&apos;is this propaganda confined to the Fatherland; it is being inculcated into those territories
bordering on,Germany and coveted by German imperialism, with the result that any one of them may be the scene of some organised incident:which might easily precipitate an international crisis: Although no complaint can yet. be;.made of any specific action by the German Government, the following . casesj j^are symptomatic:  - fw:(1) Danzig: tiThe recent success in the suppression by. the Nazis of the Trade Unions in Danzig, and the probably impending capture by the local Nazis of the Government of the Free City after the elections of the 28th May.    ;(2) Austria:The recent visit of certain Nazi Ministers to Vienna against the express wishes of the Austrian Government, in order to demonstrate the solidarity of the German and Austrian Nazi movements and to establish a virtual &quot; Anschluss &quot; on this basis.(3) The Saar:To such an extent have disturbing influences been introduced into the Saar territory that in the period from the 1st April to the 3rd May 258 persons have been charged with offences of a political origin, including 112 with acts of violence and wounding and 38 with illegal carrying or use of weapons. There has been more than one instance of interference, direct or indirect, by police from the Reich with police administration in the Saar; and recruitment for voluntary labour service in the Reich has been carried on in certain Saar districts, notably in the neighbourhood of the French frontier, with the evident intention of preparing young men as instruments for influencing the plebiscite in 1935. In consequence of these events, the Saar Governing Commission has thought it necessary to be armed with extensive powers for the maintenance of public order, and has presented to the Consultative Chamber three draft ordinances giving it such powers. ; More-over, press articles (notably in the Nazi party organ in the Saar) threatening future reprisals against those Saar officials who carry out orders of the Governing Commission which the Nazi party dislikes, together with the recent German civil service law providing for the dismissal of-;officials engaged since 1918 whose politics are unsatisfactory, or who areof, &quot;non-Aryan &quot; blood, have made it difficult for civil servants in the territory to remain loyal to the Governing Commission, which has addressed to the Council of the League a note appealing for its assistance in obtaining from potential successor States a guarantee for the acquired rights of its civil servants. .But we may take it that these attempts at external penetration are. mere side-shows, and that if the German Government are resolved to come to grips with the outside world, it is in the domain of disarmament that they intend to do so. I need not here remind my colleagues of the recent attitude of the German Delegation at Geneva. On the other hand, I would like to call their attention to the concrete measures of military reorganisation which were set forth in detail in a report by the military attache on the 25th April, which has already been circulated to the Cabinet. Since then a further paper has been prepared by the military expert to the United Kingdom Delegation reviewing the present state of German armaments from the point of view of the Disarmament Conference. A copy of this memo-randum is attached hereto.It is difficult, in the light of these reports, to continue to assume that the German Government still intend to achieve equality of status... by legal methods and by stages to be settled by international agreement. , It is, of course, possible, as pointed out by Sir H. Rumbold, that realising the growing isolation in which they find themselves, not only at Geneva but throughout the world, the German Government may be prepared to beat a retreat. But it Would be unsafe to pin our faith on any change of heart, for even if there were some outward modification in German aggressiveness, we should always have to count with the possibility that it was merely a temporary retreat^-&quot; un reculjpourmieux1.8605] ...!;;,,t.- IfT^l .   2
sauter.&quot; On this point Sir H. Rumbold, in his despatch already quoted; makes the following comment : ,-...t hv-v-fi  &quot; Since he assumed office, Herr Hitler has been as cautious and discreet.....as he was formerly blunt and frank.    He declares that he is anxious that peace should be maintained for a ten-year period. What.he probably means can be more accurately expressed by the formula : Germany needs peace until she has recovered such strength that no country can challenge her without serious and irksome preparations.&quot;I would here interpolate that this formula seems an inadequate description of present German tendencies. It is more likely that Germany contemplates an eventual challenge to other nations than that any other nation contemplates challenging Germany.Sir H. Rumbold continues : &quot;I fear that it would be misleading to base any hopes on a return to sanity or a serious modification of the views of the Chancellor and his entourage. Hitler&apos;s own record goes to show that he is a man of extra-ordinary obstinacy. His success in fighting difficulty after difficulty during the fourteen years of his political struggle is a proof of his indomitable character. He boasts of his obstinacy. Herr Hitler has, of course, sufficient . native cunning to realise the necessity for camouflage. Indeed, the recent debate in the House of Commons will have come as a warning that the task , which the new rulers of Germany have set themselves must be approached very circumspectly.&quot;The least that can be said therefore is that Hitler may call a temporary halt ,to his policy of defiant rearmament. But in any case the situation is such that the time, in my opinion, has come when His Majesty&apos;s Government should consider all possible contingencies.The French and Belgian Governments some time back drew our attention to the enrolment of Nazi storm troops as auxiliary police, and we then recognised that this enrolment constituted a clear infraction of the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles as interpreted by subsequent &apos;&apos; Allied-German &apos;&apos; agreements, and possibly also of the articles in the treaty providing for the demilitarisation of the Rhineland. As such it could be dealt with under article 213 of the treaty, which provides that &apos;&apos; so long as the present treaty remains in force, Germany undertakes to give every facility for any investigation which the Council of the League of Nations, acting if need be by a majority vote, may consider necessary.&quot; We persuaded, however, the French and Belgian Governments not to bring this matter before the Council of the League under article 213, so long as any prospect remained of a Disarmament Convention replacing the provisions of the Versailles Treaty. But if the Disarmament Conference now breaks down owing to German obstruction, we cannot expect the French and Belgian Governments to remain passive any longer. Also in that event the French Government will probably wish to accuse the German Government of many other infractions of the treaty. They profess that evidence of these infractions is contained in the famous &quot; dossier &quot; which they have more than once threatened to produce.This, then, is what is likely to happen if the German Government remain more or less passive. But we cannot exclude the possibility that they may, on the breakdown of the conference, prefer either to take the initiative and to precipitate a crisis by denouncing unilaterally Part V of the treaty, or to ignore Part V and intensify their military reorganisation ^more or less clandestinely.There would seem, therefore, to be three possible eventualities in the event of the Disarmament Conference breaking down : .(1) The French Government may ask for an investigation under article 213 to enquire into alleged infractions of the military clauses, and the German Government, for their part, may consent to submit to this .  &apos;    ,.    :, investigation. ..   (2) A demand for a League investigation having been made as above, the German Government may refuse to submit to, it. ;,;;    (3). The German Government may themselves take the initiative and denounce . ;; : Part V of the treaty.   . . , - &apos;       . J. -&quot;^
. In the case of (1). the procedure will follow the normal League course, and, having submitted to the original humiliation of investigation, we may/assume that the German Government will equally accept and abide by its findings.But can the German Government, after all its recent propaganda, afford to submit to an investigation by League officials on German soil % This seems hardly possible, but if they refuse then we are up against a direct violation of article 213 and all its consequences. &apos;&quot;;&apos;Lastly, if the German Government adopt course (3), we are faced/not so much with an actual infraction of any treaty obligation, but with a definite act of unilateral repudiation.In both cases the situation would be such as to constitute at Once a &quot; dispute &quot; between the Allied signatories of the Treaty of Versailles of the one part and Germany of the other, and the bearing on such a dispute of the Covenant, the Pact of Paris and the Locarno arbitration treaties will require careful consideration with a view to determining the circumstances in which the employment of military or economic pressure on Germany would be permissible under the instruments in question. A separate memorandum on this subject is being prepared.Meanwhile, in order to forestall, if possible, any precipitate action by Herr Hitler, Sir H. Rumbold has conveyed to him, on my instructions, the following message : &quot;At this critical juncture in the life of the Disarmament Conference and on the eve of the World Economic Conference, it is clearly in the interests of the whole world, and not least of Germany herself, that inter-national tranquillity and confidence in Europe should be preserved and, if possible, increased. Unfortunately, the recent change of regime in Germany has produced the opposite effect a fact which His Majesty&apos;s Government deeply deplore. We trust, therefore, that during the difficult time ahead of us all we may hope that the German Government will not merely abstain from doing or saying anything which may increase the already existing nervousness in the public opinion of Europe, but that it will go further and, within the framework and in the spirit of the Covenant of the League of Nations, collaborate in the common task of establishing that confidence which is necessary to the success of the Disarmament Conference, which is the aim of the Four-Power Pact negotiations, and which is essential to the success of the World Economic Conference.&quot;I have not yet received an answer to this message, but I shall find it no doubt in the speech which Herr Hitler is to deliver in the Reichstag to-morrow.It may then be that the question will arise of arranging to convey some sort of concerted warning by His Majesty&apos;s Government, France and the United States, as a final effort to restrain the Nazi Government from embarking on a policy of open defiance.J: S;Foreign Office, May 16, 1933. -Enclosure!Germany and Disarmament.THE time has come when Germ any&apos;s attitude to disarmament and the attitude of the United Kingdom towards Germany ought to be reviewed. In the past there has been much sympathy with Germany, and public opinion was in favour of granting her equality of status by degrees and in proportion to evidence of good behaviour; even France had realised that the end of the disarmament clauses of the Peace Treaty was in sight. Germany had laboured for thirteen years under these restrictions. While no one believed that they had been kept with complete fidelity, the breaches which could be proved in open court were individually not great, though their cumulative effect was not inconsiderable! Germany had not been idle during these years, and, with great ingenuity, had carried out a steady erosion of the disarmament clauses, in some &apos; cases with permission, but more frequently without.&apos; Thirty-eight thousand of her police have just been declared by the Effectives. Committee to be definitely on h
military, basis; they. are,.well armed with &quot;machine,,guns and armoured-, cars, organised, in military formations, and with, military staffs. Another 4.4,000 have been: lpeky to escape a similar decision. Very extensive preparations have also b^em,0!made to prepare German industry for industrial mobilisation. The ^ratifications of their :heavy industry, with interlocking companies abroad, have ; spread; everywhere, . Gas, munition and optical glass, factories, in which German companies have a controlling interest, have sprung up in neighbouring countries. It-is also calculated that there are in the combined Nazi and Stahlhelm forces over a million young men of military age who have received some military training.... : Public opinion has been well aware of the continuous breaches of the treaty, but was disposed to regard them as the not unexpected reaction by a high-spirited people against their penal character. It was ready to go forward, in spite of these, evasions, with a first step towards equality of status, though France was naturally more hesitant. So long as Briining could retain his precarious hold upon the Chancellorship and continue with some form of parliamentary govern-ment, there remained a certain amount of faith in Germany&apos;s pacific intentions. The advent of the &quot;Presidential&quot; Cabinets of von Papen and Schleicher^ however, hardly concealed the mutterings of the coming storm.Within a few weeks of his arrival, Hitler has carried out a revolution and made himself complete master of Germany. The country has given itself up to&apos; a delirium of reawakened nationalism and of the most blatant and dangerous militarism. Fuel has been added to the flame by an orgy of military parades and ; torch-light processions and by a constant stream of patriotic wireless addresses delivered by masters of the art of propaganda, including Hitler himself. Behind all this surge and fury, Hitler has been swiftly consolidating his position. On the political side, he has imprisoned a sufficient number of his political opponents to get the Reichstag to vote its own temporary extinction. He has successfully abolished the rights of all German States and put Nazi Commis-sioners in charge. In Prussia Goring has been installed as Commissioner, the appointment carrying with it the all-important control of the police. He is ::Hitler.&apos;:Si chief lieutenant, and is spoken of as the most violent, the most stupid and the most reckless of his entourage. He has also been nominated Minister for Air, with the mission of raising a military air force. The whole country has been llitlerised, and the swastika flag flies side by side with the old banner of the Reich on all public buildings and Embassies..:.-.; On the military side, Storm detachments of the Nazis and Stahlhelm have been converted into auxiliary police. As the Nazi detachments were recruited from the most desperate and violent elements of. the unemployed, they do not seem particularly suitable for police work, the more so since arms have been placed in their hands. Their numbers are probably in the vicinity of 75,000. They, are to undergo military training similar to that given to the militarised police,The incorporation of these troops in the police is, of course, a flagrant violation of the Peace Treaty. It is believed that the total strength of the Nazi Storm detachments is 300,000 men. Schleicher had started Voluntary Camps for Youth Training in military subjects and they were already in full swing before Hitler&apos;s arrival. The openly-expressed intention of this organisa-tion is to train instructors in &quot;Defence Sport&quot; and Field Exercises for the Associations. By March 1934 it is estimated that 40,000 potential instructors will have received training. A National Labour Corps was also in existence, 250,000 strong. They are dressed in uniform and trained in camps under military discipline. Photographs and recent accounts of them in the Times clearly indicate the military character of their training, though part of their time is devoted to work on roads, &amp;c. It has just been announced that the Chancellor has issued a decree calling up all youths of 20 years of age ,; annually for national labour service for twelve months beginning on the 1st January, 1934. This will produce an annual contingent of 350,000. . The Secretary. of State for Labour Service announces that every youth must do his year in the Labour Service before passing-op to,, military service, when conscription has been reintroduced. Where the money for this force is to come from, no one knows. The alleged objects of iinculcating;, discipline, and patriotism and providing . physical training, and productive;work, as, welLaa such training,described as .&quot; Defence Sport,&apos;&apos; are ;the merest camouflage. for, intensive -military training; It cannot -be, doubted that arms will Be in their hands before long and instruction will be given in their use.
All this is; an equally flagrant Violation of&apos;the Peace; Treaty. The Stahlhelm has been forcibly absorbed into the Nazi Army and the military activities of these bodies will certainly be intensified. Goring has put a number of air personael into uniform, and the formation of an Air Force seems to.be actively proceeding.On the material&apos;side, it is understood that the Air Ministry have identified at least 125 fighting machines in existence or being made, exclusive of some 60 believed to be at Lipetsk, in Russia. Information has been received frtitn secret sources that an order has been given by the Reichswehr : Ministerium&apos; to1 the Dofnier Works for 36 twin-engined night bombers. The cost of these orders&apos;is to be disguised under funds for employment of the unemployed. There are numerous indications in the last two months of increased activity in the German armaments industry. Reports have been received that twelve firms, which are not allowed to produce armaments, have received test orders for war material. Preparations are reported to have been made for the reopening of eight former Government arsenals. -At Geneva the German attitude has stiffened considerably. The German delegate has reiterated his refusal to accept the cardinal points of the British Draft Convention, and has, in particular, declined to give up the ReichsWehr and accept the uniformisation of European armies on a militia basis. The -increasing insolence of the Germans has brought discussion on effectives to a, complete standstill. When material is discussed, there are strong indications that the demands for samples of military aeroplanes, tanks and heavy guns will be very large.What then is to be our attitude? Are we to go forward as if nothing has happened&apos;? Can we afford to ignore what is going on behind the scenes in Germany? The brief sketch of the post-war position, and particularly &apos;the intensification of military preparations under the Hitler regime, coupled with the strident appeals to force of the Nazi leaders, not only mean a secret German rearmament but create an entirely new situation. Admittedly it would: be a good thing to get Germany bound by a convention, as a breakdown would mean that she would commence to rearm at once. On the other hand, there is little Use in a convention limiting effectives and material, if the preparations above indicated are to proceed unchecked, while the warlike spirit is being openly roused to a fever heat against the Poles as the first objective, with France as the ultimate enemy. Viscount Grey, in a recent speech, remarked how thankful the world must be that in the present condition of Germany she was disarmed by the peace treaty. Had this not been the case, Viscount Grey remarked, we should inevitably be once more on the verge of war. No moment could be worse chosen than the present one to advocate drastic reductions in the armaments of France, the Little Entente and Poland. Moreover, the destruction of all heavy material and bombing machines belonging to the French and her allies and to our own armed forces seems madness in the face of this direct German menace. We should do well to remember the old Ironsides&apos; motto of &quot;Trust in God and keep your powder dry.&quot; ;! :- -If it is dangerous to go forward with disarmament, what, then, is to be done? There appears to be one bold solution. France, the United States and ourselves should address a stern warning to Germany that there can be ho disarmament, no equality of status and no relaxation of the Treaty of Versailles unless a complete reversion of present military preparations and tendencies takes place in Germany. Admittedly this will provoke a crisis and the danger of war will be brought appreciably nearer. We should have to say that we shall insist upon the enforcement of the Treaty of Versailles, and in this insistence, with its hint of force in the background,&apos; presumably the United States would not join. But Germany knows that she cannot fight at present and we must call her bluff. She is powerless before the French army and our fleet. Hitler, for1 all his bombast, must give way. If such a step seems too forceful, the only alternative is to carry out some minimum measure of disarmament and to allow things tc drift for another five years, by which time, unless there is a change of heart in Germany, war seems inevitable. German rearmament will by then be&apos;ah accomplished fact, and the material of the ex-Allies, which would take years of work and scores of millions of pounds to replace, may have been destroyed. This is an alternative which is unlikely to lead us anywhere. Strong combined action, however, as suggested above,1&apos;should prove&apos;decisive,-even though&apos;the threat of military- pressure1 might have to: be maintained &apos;f or years, :.dalling;;f or &quot;fresh
monetary sacrifices, until Germany is brought to her senses.i But even this heavy responsibility should be accepted rather than that we should allow all the sacrifices of the last war to be in vain and the world to go down in economic ruin. There is a mad dog abroad once more, and we must resolutely combine either to ensure its destruction or at least its confinement until the disease has run its course.May 7, 1983.
