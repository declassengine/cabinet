SECRET.CP. 139 (33)COPY NO.1 C A B i I E T.INDIA.Appreciation of the political Situation by the Government of India, dated 22nd May, 1933Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Oonfidential Appreciation of the Political Situation in India, dated 22nd May, 1933, issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.The outstanding event since the last appreciation is the fast undertaken by Mr, Gandhi for &quot;reasons&quot;, as he has stated, &quot;wholly unconnected with Government and connected solely with the harijan movement&quot;     On receipt of this announcement, Government decided toat he should be unconditionally released as soon as the fast began.     It had been sedulously put about for some months past that Gandhi had lost all interest in civil disobedience, ana that his whole mind was devoted to untouchability.     In a statement he had himself issued from the jail he had made it plain that for others, at any rate, it was desirable to make a choice between untouchabilitv work and civil disobedience.His fast, therefore, and declaration that accompanied it, might well be regarded as an indication that he intended to devote his life to untouchability.     In these circumstances, it seemed clear that the wisest course v/as to take Mr. Gandhi&apos;s action at its face value, and to release him on the ground of humanity connected with a non-political issue.     Any other course indeed would have.been most difficult to justify to public opinion.     Mr. Gandhi, however, within a few hours of his release, took up the political issue and published a,statement dealing at length with civil disobedience.     The announcement of the fast had puzzled all classes in India, for the motive seemed hardly to justify such; drastic action, though it was true that his campaign against antouchability was not making satisfactory progress owing to the growing opposition of orthodoxy and lack of support of many Congress workers.     Reflection, however,
1 (h O&apos;I if&apos; ei2.brings an increasing belief that the motive of the fast was mainly to secure his re-entry into the political field.There is good reason to believe that he was fully aware of the growing split in Congress, that he realised certain leaders were contemplating a meeting at which a new policy, possibly involving abandoning the movement, would be advanced if not adopted, and that he was anxious to make an attempt to reunite various groups and thereby restore, if possible, the prestige of Congress, recover his own position and enter into negotiations with Government.     His statement re-asserted his belief in civil disobedience and contained suggestions for improving the movement if it were to be continued.     There should however be a temporary suspension of the movement because civil resisters would be&quot;in a state of terrible suspense during the three weeks&apos; fast&quot;.Government were asked to take advantage of this suspension, and release all civil disobedience prisoners unconditionally and withdraw the Ordinances.     Mr. Gandhi, if he survives the fast, would tender advice to Congress leaders and to the Government;    if no understanding was . arrived at, as a result of his effort, Government could revive Ordinance rule, but if there is the will on the part of the Government he had no doubt that a modus . ope rand i could be found.     Civil disobedience, however, could not be withdrawn so long as many civil resisters were in jail and no settlement could be arrived at without leaders such as Tat el, Nehru and Abdul Ghaffar Khan.This statement has, of course, been represented in Nationalist quarters as a bona fide attempt to create peaceful conditions, and the action of the Government in promptly countering it by reiterating their policy, that there could be no release pf civil disobedience prisoners
unless they were satisfied that civil disobedience had been abandoned, has been challenged as a provocative rejection of a peace offer.     These commentators ignore the lesson of 1931&apos;.     They also ignore the fact that the suggested bargain is one-sided;   Congress merely suspend a movement vhich they are finding it increasingly difficult to continue under present conditions, but which could more easily be revived if the leaders, such as Jawahir Lai, Nehru and, more particularly, Abdul Ghaffar Khan were released unconditionally, and if their position were thereby restored. There is no indication and no probability that any real co-operation would follow such release*     Government had no alternative but to reassert their position, and thereby prevent the confidence of their supporters being seriously shaken by the impression gaining ground that they were prepared to negotiate with Congress, even though the latter did not abandon its unlawful activities.     The/action taken by the Government has proved very reassuring to its supporters.One significant point in connection with the fast must be mentioned;    it appears to have created far less general interest than the fast of September last.     It is also significant that from two quarters Mr. Gandhi&apos;s action has been criticised;    on one side, Subhas Bose and Patel, in Europe, have rejected his leadership and advocated a radical reorganisation of the Congress programme, but this attitude does not appear to- have received much support in India;    on the other side, Maulana Shaukat Ali and others regard his action as a definite embarrassment to the real peace-makers.Apart from this there has been no political incident of importance during the last month.     The campaign against
X v ;Jterrorism in Bengal continues to make satisfactory progress and a report just received from Chittagong shows that two important absconders were killed in a fight with the police and two more were arrested.   : There are now signs that in consequence of the firm policy adopted by the Government of Bengal, Government officers are getting more support and assistance from the general public.Bengal has been free from terrorist assassinations for relatively quite a long time., but terrorist gangs are still active and every week reports of serious dacoities are received.     In Madras also - a province hitherto singularly free from this form of crime, some absconders from Northern India committed a daring robbery on a bank in Ootacamund;    one of the offenders died as a result of a bomb explosion in Madras, and others have been arrested.The arrival of Indian delegates in London, marks the beginning of what it is hoped will oe the last stage in the constitutional discussions.     The Burma Council, though given ample opportunity for coming&apos; to a decision on the question of federation has again failed to do so, and recent session has been completely infructuous except as showing political incapacity of present Council.
