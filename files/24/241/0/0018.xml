His Bntan,nio Majest.y&apos;s Government.) 89Copy.138 (33).Four-Power Agre ement.Note by the Permanent Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs circulated by direction of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs-.I circulate herewith by direction of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs a telegram received from the Secretary of State in regard to the negotiations for a four-Power Agreement, together with an English translation of the latest text drawn up by the Italian Government after- ....discussions with the British and French Ambassadors; -... -and also with Captain Goring. The crucial article of this text from our point of view is Noe 2 which, in the form shown, has been accepted by the Italian Government.-2.     It will be recollected that one of the objects of the agreement was to provide machinery by which practical effect could be given to Article 19 of the Covenant of the League of Nations.     The text of this article is as follows:-&quot;The Assembly may from time to time advise the &quot;reconsideration by Members of the League of treaties &quot;which have become inapplicable, and the considera-&quot;tion of international conditions whose continuance &quot;might endanger the peace of the world.&quot;In ...
In other words, the object was to enable the discussion of the question of treaty revision to take place effectively within the framework of the League, with due regard to the rights of all the interested parties.     This provision created considerable uneasi-ness, particularly amongst the Little Entente States, and in Poland, and in their memorandum which was com-rmnlcated to His Majesty Vs Government on April 11th the French Government insisted that if the collaboration of the Four Powers was to receive a precise definition in the terms of the Articles of the Covenant, it would be necessary to reaffirm at the same time the provisions of Article 10, which safeguards the territorial integrity of Members of the League and of Article 16 which lays down the sanctions to be enforced against a Covenant-breaking State.     Consequently, in their draft text which has been accepted as the basis of the present text, the French Government added, in Article 2, a mention of both Article 10 and Article 16 of the Covenant, side by side with the mention of Article 19030     The insertion of a mention of Article 10 of the Covenant would have been difficult to resist, since Articles 10 and 19 deal with two sides of the same question, viz/ respect of treaties and the question of their revision, and both the Italian and German Govorn-ments were prepared to accept it.    But the mention of Article 16 is not so easy to defend, since it is of more general application and does not deal specially with the European problem.     For this reason itsomission 0.o
omission was suggested by the German Government, and subsequently by His Majesty&apos;s Government, both  or this reason and more especially because its inclusion is calculated to disturb public opinion in this countrys which is strongly averse from undertaking commitments under this Article,    The Italian Govern-ment were also opposed to its inclusion.4.     Now, however, as a result of French insistence the German and Italian Government have acquiesced, though reluctantly, in the mention of Article 16, and have accordingly left upon His Majesty&apos;s Government the onus of deciding whether they shall promote early agreement by accepting this unwelcome reference, or whether they shall continue to resist the French demand with the consequent risk of a breakdown and the loss of the advantages of an immediate successo5.     We should still obviously prefer not to give way on this point, but we. are faced with the difficulty of being the only Government prepared to maintain its opposition, and with the resultant danger of being-misrepresented, not only in the world at large, but by political adversaries at home, as having wrecked an agreement which is on the verge of conclusion.&apos;6.     Moreover it is to be observed that the extent&apos; of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s commitment under Article 2 is limited to examining with the other signatories, under reserve of decisions which can only be taken by the regular organs of the League, allproposals
proposals relative to the methods and procedures calculated to give full effect to the Article.     His Majesty&apos;s Government have, after all, signed the Covenant, and, as it new stands, the text of Article 2 is so generally anodyne that it should not involve them in serious difficulties,     (The whole text has indeed become rather anodyne as the result of numerous drafts and redrafts by Four Powers.)    Further, as the Secretary of State has pointed out, it may not be disadvantageous to examine this Article with the others. We should be able to define our own position and if necessary stipulate that we could only act under the Article in accordance with our own judgment after a case had arisen.7.     It therefore comes to this, that from the aspect of pure external politics there is little tenable ground for resistance if all the others are prepared to acquiesce.     On the other hand acceptance of the reference to Article 16 may lead to mis-representation - however unreasonable - at home.   The matter appears to me to be in its essence one rather of internal than external importance.An immediate decision appears to be necessary in order that instructions may be sent to Geneva.(Signed)   R0 Vansittart23rd May, 1933 o
Telegram from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.   May 23rd, 19330IMMEDIATE.Following from Secretary of State:-Alois! sew me about proposed Four Power Pact this evening.   Signor Mussolini is most anxious to get an agreed document initialled at Geneva within the next few days holding that it would be a valuable proof of European efforts to promote peace and co-operation and would improve the e,tmosphere both of Disarmament Conference and Economic Conference.   If initialling took place this week Aloisi hinted to me privately that Signer Mussolini has in mind the idea of a, meeting later on e,t Home between heads or other leading representatives of the four sta.tr eso2.   I had before me draft of May 20th similar to that sent to London by air mail by Sir R, Graham^ I gather that there are only two points of difference outstanding,,   In Article 3 the French would like the phrase altered to run. &quot;le principe de 11 egalite\ des droits tel qu&apos;il a ete* reconnu par la, resolution du onze decembre 1932 doit avoir une valeur&quot;.   I see no objection to this and suggested to Aloisi that Signor Mussolini should make it his business to persuade Herr Goering to this effect.3.   The other outstanding difference is as tothe
trie mention of Article 16 of the covenant in Article 2,   Sir R0 Graham says that Italians and Germans hove withdrawn their opposition to this reference while the French strongly advocate ito   So that opposition is now confined to ourselves,  0 you on reflection consider that we should maintain this opposition? With Italian end French agreeing I am doubtful whether we should resisto   After all we have signed the Covenant and it may not be a disadvantage to examine Article with three otherso   We should be able to define our own position and if necessary stipulate that we could only act under Article in accordance with our own judgment after the case had arisen,40   It will be extremely difficult for me to carry through these drafting discussions to agreement without^assistanceo   Could Mr0 Sargent come out by tomorrow&apos;s train to help me?   In the meantime I think Cabinet must be asked to decide the point about mentioning Article 16*   If we give way on this, prompt agreement with others seems certain^   On the other hand if .we hold out negotiations may break down and we lose all the advantage of an immediate successc   Cabinet will be the best judge of importance of the matter by having continuous text before it in English with a very brief introductioiio
