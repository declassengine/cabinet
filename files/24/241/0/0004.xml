THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.  May 1933.SECRET. Copy No.   5.1C.O.S. 309.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.THE MILITARY  ASPECT  OF  THE  ANGLO-EGYPTIAN  TREATYPROPOSALS (1933).(Previous Paper No. C.O.S. 308.)REPORT.NOW that negotiations for a settlement with Egypt are again under consideration, we desire to summarise the reasons for our advice to the Government that the removal of British troops from the vicinity of Cairo is militarily unsound, advice which has been consistently tendered at intervals since the year 1924, when our opinion was first asked.2. From the military point of view the outstanding consideration in an Anglo-Egyptian Treaty is the security for all time of the Suez Canal, a means of communication that is vital to the Empire. It follows, therefore, that the location of our troops must from this aspect be dependent solely on this over-riding factor, and that they must be so placed as to afford the greatest possible guarantee of protecting the Canal in all circumstances,3. The military defence of a position cannot be secured merely by its occupation. For this purpose a distribution of the available force in depth is essential, and this consideration alone is sufficient to characterise the scheme for locating all our troops in the Canal Zone as militarily unsound, necessitating, as it would, a dispersal of the troops along the Canal as a protection against raids. The fallacy of such a policy was exposed by the Turkish attacks on the Canal in January 1915. These attacks, if properly handled, could have done very serious damage, but, fortunately for us, they merely served to warn us of the risks we were running, and the net result was that our defensive system was later thrown out well to the eastward of the Canal. In short, we consider the necessity for depth and concentration all important, and are unable to depart from military principles, whose truth has been frequently emphasised in war, to suit a political consideration. Such principles may be over-ridden, but they cannot be changed at will.4. In turning to our position to-day, the most likely risks to be guarded against are those arising in Egypt itself. It would be dangerous to assume that because at present anti-British or anti-foreign agitation has died down, it will not recrudesce in the future. In our opinion such a contingency is inevitable. In this connection it is significant to note that although the Iraq Treaty has only been in force less than one year, there is already a considerable agitation for revision in regard to the essential British military clauses designed for the safeguarding of British interests and vital Imperial communications.Threats to our vital artery of communications in the Canal Zone would probably take the form of attempts at sabotage, but it cannot be too strongly emphasised that the plans for these attempts would be conceived and hatched in [8617] B
Cairo, and that the presence of a British force in the neighbourhood of that place would act as a powerful deterrent. A good intelligence system, calculated to detect at an early stage such attempts and the power of immediate action for their ( Suppression in. Cairo, would be much more effective than plans for their interception oh the banks of the Canal. The same principle applies to the suppression of any demonstration which may assume a violent form or outbreaks which&apos; may occur through a weakening of the Egyptian Government.    &apos; -;5. There is another important aspect to the question to which we would refer; that of the control of the Egyptian Army and Air Force. They cannot at the moment be considered a serious menace, but through lack of discipline they might be induced to join the mob and give them sufficient armed assistance to create a very serious situation; or, as has happened in the past, the Egyptian Army might again become the instrument of personal or party ambition.A note on the Arabi Rebellion in 1881-82 is attached as an appendix to this paper, and serves to illustrate the possibilities which we have in mind.History may well repeat itself, and we cannot be sure that King Fuad will prove a surer rock on which to lean for the maintenance, of order in Egypt than King Tewfik.The Egyptian Air Force stationed in Cairo, if misused, might become a potential danger, against which British forces in its immediate vicinity would prove an adequate safeguard. Vessels in any part of the Suez Canal, even that part which passes through the Bitter Lakes, in which special channels are dredged, are vulnerable to air attack. A vessel grounded or sunk in the Canal might block it for a considerable period.6. As far as can be reasonably foreseen, an attack in force from the West other than in the contingencies already referred to, is unlikely.7. Turning now to the considerations for the defence of the Canal from the East. So long as Palestine remains a base for the operation of British forces, we are assured of a sufficient depth in front of the Canal to give us the freedom necessary for the proper conduct of its defence. It is, however, of first importance that in defending the Canal from the eastward we should have at our backs an Egypt that is within our firm control. Not only is this essential for the security of our rearward communications, but we cannot, in the event of an attack in force on the Canal from the East, contemplate having to make detachments to deal with an unstable situation in our rear. We are firmly of the opinion that the essential dependability of Egypt can only be assured by the location in peace of British troops in the vicinity of Cairo. Placed thus, we would be able to control any signs of trouble from its earliest stages.8. Hence the security of the Canal demands the presence of British troops in the close vicinity of Cairo; but there are other considerations also which tend to show that their retention there is most desirable. Although under the proposed Treaty the safety of foreigners is to become the responsibility of Egypt, it would, as we have already pointed out, be dangerous to assume that because under Sidky Pasha&apos;s stable government anti-foreign outbreaks have been checked, they will not recur in the future. The proximity of British troops to Cairo would not only be a steadying influence in itself, and thus diminish the risk of such outbreaks; but if, despite this, they should occur and their suppression should demand armed foreign intervention, it is of the first importance that the measures needed to restore the situation should be taken by us and not by some other foreign Power. Our special position and interests in Egypt demand no less, and it is obvious that for action of this sort British troops located in the neighbourhood of Cairo are better placed than if the entire garrison is moved to the Canal Zone. In this connection it is perhaps not unreasonable to visualise a situation in which Italian subjects in Egypt (and there are many) had been injured or robbed, and the eagerness with which Italy would seize the opportunity offered to gain a footing in the country, and more especially if we, owing to serious commitments elsewhere, were not in a position to take immediate steps to deal with the situation.9. In dealing with the location of troops in Egypt in former years considerable importance has been attached to the necessity for safeguarding the water supply for the Canal Zone and the danger of placing our troops in a position in which their sole drinking water supply would be at the mercy of
ill-disposed: Egyptians.: While still of .opinion, that frpm this point of view, also the location of troops in Cairo would be an advantage we do not wish to press the particular point since in our opinion it is no longer, vital provided an adequate emergency.,supply is maintained&apos; for,the use of our troops should they be located in the Canal Zone. It must be realised, also, that in the eyen^trpf operations to the East of the Canal the only source of sufficient and suitable drinking water is this Sweet Water Canal which takes off from the Nile/hear Cairo. Adequate measures would consequently have to&apos;be taken to secure this source from sabotage or contamination.   .10. We feel constrained to remark on a suggestion which has been made as to the possibility of the location of the troops in some position intermediate between Cairo and the Canal Zone with a view to meeting as far as possible the susceptibilities of both sides. We are aware, of the view that there is a strong national feeling in Egypt against the continued presence of foreign troops in the vicinity of the capital, and if, in deference to these feelings, the removal of the troops from the neighbourhood of Cairo is considered necessary in order to obtain a Treaty we are doubtful if the move of a few miles, would prove, sufficient. However, we have given careful consideration to the suggestion, and as a result we are of the opinion, and in this we are supported by the Genera! Officer Commanding the British Troops in Egypt, that no. such alternative, site exists owing to lack of training facilities. Even if a locality that was suitable in this respect had been found, it would in no sense have met our essential requirements, viz., that our military security in Egypt demands the retention of a portion of our garrison in the neighbourhood of Cairo. . .(Signed)ERNLE CHATFIELD.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, May 19, 1933.[8617 Ib 2
APPENDIX.Eotfract from the First Three Pages of the 1st Chapter of the Military History &quot;io 0f the Campaign of 1882 in Egypt. &apos;&apos;^&apos;[&apos;&apos;BY the middle of May 1882, a series of military&apos; demonstrations had placed Arabi, a Colonel of the&apos;Egyptian Army, in virtual possession of the executive power in Egypt. Tewfik, who had. on the deposition of Ismail in June 1879, been appointed by the Sultan, at the instance of the European Powers, Khedive of Egypt, retained little more than the title. The armed power was in the hands of Arabi; and it had become evident that,&apos;whatever Ministers were appointed, they would be virtually puppets in Arabi&apos;s hands.Ninety thousand Europeans, of whom the majority were English and Erench subjects,.were engaged in business in Egypt. The English and French Governments had, on the&apos; 6th January, 1882, given to the Khedive an assurance of their support in an &quot; identic declaration,&quot; since known as the &quot; dual note,&quot; in which they declared to him &quot;that the English and French Governments consider the maintenance of His Highness on the throne, on the terms laid down by the Sultan&apos;s: Firmans and officially recognised by the two Governments, as alone able to guarantee for the present and the future good order and general prosperity in Egypt, in which England and France are equally interested . . . . ; they are convinced that His Highness will draw from this assurance that confidence and strength which he requires to direct the destinies of Egypt and its people.&quot;On the 20th-May, 1882, the Allied English and French fleet entered Alexandria Harbour to watch over the threatened interests, and to offer an earnest of the promised support.On the 7th June, 1882, Dervish Pasha, with full powers from the Porte, arrived in Alexandria to restore order in Egypt. For a few days it remained uncertain what the result of Dervish Pasha&apos;s action might be, but on the 11th June, whilst he, the Khedive, and Arabi were in Cairo, riots of a serious character broke out in Alexandria between the Mahometan and Christian population. The effect was immediately to awaken throughout the country a religious excitement which had long been smouldering among the Mahometans, and in the course of the next few weeks it is calculated that fully two-thirds of the European population had fled the country, the whole course of business was thrown out of gear, and large numbers of Arab employees were clamouring for bread.On the 23rd June a conference.of six of the European Powers assembled for the first time at Constantinople to deal with the affairs of Egypt. Turkey refused to send a representative.On the 24th June the English and French Controllers, who till then had held decisive authority as Representatives of the protecting Powers, received a notice that they would no longer be allowed to sit in Council with the Egyptian Ministry; Arabi announced his intention of resisting by arms any attempt to restore order by landing troops; earthworks were begun by the Egyptians between Ramleh and Abukir.At about the same time it was announced that the Sultan had conferred upon Arabi the First Class of the Order of the Madjidie.Great alarm as to the safety of the Suez Canal began to prevail in consequence of the general disorder and religious excitement. Bedouins were reported as frequently appearing in threatening groups along the banks.Various indications showed that, even if Arabi could be trusted to do his utmost to preserve order, his power to do so depended upon the temper of the Egyptian soldiery, which was daily more and more passing beyond control.It soon became clear that no mere occupation of the Suez Canal alone could be more than a temporary expedient. The danger lay in the disorder existing in Egypt. That disorder could only be dealt with at its headquarters in Cairo. This conclusion, which on general grounds was hardly open to dispute, was enforced by the consideration that the whole supply of fresh water, both of Alexandria and of the stations on the Suez Canal, was under the control of those who held Cairo and the interior of the country.* * * * * *
9 9 d dNor was this all; for, as a military problem, it is scarcely possible to exaggerate the contrast between the rapidity and certainty with which it was. possible to deal with the question at Cairo, and the danger, the loss, the difficulty and the expense of a long occupation of the Canal. A force detailed to hold the Canal would be exposed throughout the entire length of that highway of commerce to the attacks of an enemy holding the Delta. The railway running direct from Zagazig to Ismailia and Es-Salihiyeh, nearly at right-angles to^the, course of the Canal, would offer to such an enemy the greatest possible facilities for moving and supplying his troops. The whole of the Egyptian Army could thus be, at any moment chosen by its commander, directed against a fraction of the force defending the Canal. The weariness, and consequent loss of health, spirits and efficiency, entailed by such an occupation, when protracted, would become a serious element of weakness for the protecting troops.The danger of attack from the Bedouin tribes on the eastern side would continually increase as they became better and better aware of the fact that we had not ventured to disturb the hostile power of Arabi in Egypt, and that he was seriously threatening our position. Our troops holding the narrow strip of the shores of the Canal, receiving all their supplies along that very line, would thus find the desert along which all the water traffic must pass occupied by hostile tribes; and the successful attack upon any isolated post or ship would enable the Egyptians to block the whole course of the Canal, and to destroy the means of communication and supply throughout.******It is necessary very clearly to distinguish between the aspect which this question presented as a purely military problem, and the determination on the matter which Her Majesty&apos;s Government, taking the whole political situation into account, were able as yet to arrive at.******o
