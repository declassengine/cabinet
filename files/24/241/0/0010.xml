The Committee had before them a Note by thethe TradesUnion Secretary covering a letter from the General Secretary ofCongressGeneral the Trades Union Congress General Council,  inter aliaCouncil.on the question of the appointment of Industrial Advisers to the United Kingdom Delegation.    (For the text of this letter see Appendix II).With regard to the first part of Mr. Citrine&apos;s letter, the Committee have invited the Prime Minister to communicate with the Secretary General of the League of Nations, and to ascertain from him the precise nature of the status and representation which certain League Committees, International Organisations, and other bodies, which the League have already invited to the Conference,will have; at the same time pointing out that the World Economic Conference of 1927 differs from the Monetary and Economic Conference in that the latter is, while the formerThe Draft Agenda fortheConference.
was not,  a Conference of Governments.With regard to the concluding paragraph of Mr. Citrine&apos;s letter, the Committee discussed the question of Industrial Advisers to the United Kingdom Delegation in the light of the experience of the Ottawa Conference, and after examining various alternatives, agreed to make the following recommendations to the Cabinet :-That there should he constituted a Panel of Industrial Advisers to the United Kingdom Delegation to the Conference.That this Panel should consist of one, or at most, two representatives from each of the following National Industrial organisations the Federation of British Industries The Association of Chambers of Commerce, The Chamber of Shipping (in consultationwith the Liverpool S.S. Owners&apos;Association). Agriculture, andThe Trades Union Congress General Council.That,  as in the case of the Ottawa Conference, the Panel of Industrial Advisers should include an Adviser on the trade and commerce of the Crown Colonies.-That the members of the Panel should only be consulted as and when the United Kingdom Delegation or individual members of that Delegation desired advice.That members of the Panel should not be admitted as of right to the proceedings of the Conference, and should not be supplied with documents prepared for the use of the United Kingdom Delegation at the Conference, save&apos; with the express sanction of the Delegation in the case of particular documents.mp os it ion. 3. With reference to Cabinet 34 (33) conclusion the Unitedigdom 5 (a) and (d) ,  the Committee considered the compositionlegation.of the United Kingdom Delegation to the Conference.In the course of discussion,  the Prime Minister expressed some doubt whether, in view of the fact that he would be President of the Conference, it would be advisable that his name should be included in the list of the United Kingdom Delegates.    In any case, he hoped
to be able to attend meetings of the&apos; United Kingdom Delegation,  though it would not be possible for him to undertake the day to day work of a United Kingdom Delegate.The Committee were reminded that at previous Conferences, such for example, as the Versailles Peace Conference,  the Washington Naval Conference, the London Naval Conference, and the Hague Conference, the Presidents in each case had been members of their respective Delegations, and that no suggestion had ever been made that the impartiality of the President of an International Conference could be affected by the fact that he was often the leader and, as a rule a member of his national Delegation.      In these circumstances, the Prime Minister said that he was quite willing, if his colleagues so wished, that his name should be included among the United Kingdom Delegates.The Lord President of the Council said that it would only be possible for him to be a member of the United .Kingdom Delegation if he was to sacrifice other work which he felt was at the moment of more importance in the interests of the Government.    He, therefore, asked that his name should not be included in the United Kingdom Delegation.After further discussion,  the Committee agreed to recommend to the Cabinet: -That the United Kingdom Delegation to the Monetary and Economic Conference should be constituted a^s follows :-The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Leader of  theDelegati on)The Prime minister the Secretary of State for WarThe Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Secretary of State for Dominion AffairsThe Secretary of State for the colonies the President of the Board of trade the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.16th May,  1933.

APPENDIX    II.THE TRADES UNION CONGRESS GENERAL COUNCIL.o iTRANSPORT HOUSE. (South Block), Smith Square, LONDON, SeW,l.27th April, 1933.The Rt. Hon. J. ramsay MacDonald, 10, Downing Street, London, S.W.Dear Mr. MacDonald,World Monetary and Economic, Conference.Now that the date of the World Monetary and Economic Conference has been fixed, I should be very glad if you could let me know whether the Conference is to be constituted on the lines of the World Economic Conference in 1927, when representatives of Governments, employers&apos; organisations, and workers&apos; organisations were present.The General Council of the Trades Union Congress feel that the subjects to be discussed at the Conference are vitally important from the point of view of the welfare of organised labour.The General Council have given c-onaiderable thought to many of these questions, and it is felt that an opportunity should be given in the interests of the workers for these views to be expressed and be given due weight at the Conference.If it is not proposed to constitute the Conference on these lines, perhaps you could let me know whether it is intended to ask industrial organisations, including the Trade Union Movement, to appoint industrial advisers as was done in the ease of the Ottawa Conference last year.I am,Yours sincerely,(Signed) WALTER M.CITRINE.General Secretary.
