THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HI8 BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1933.SECRET.Copy No.    46CP. 141 (33).CABINET.REPORT  OF  THE  COMMITTEE  ON ECONOMIC   consultation and  CO-OPERATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.1. I CIRCULATE herewith the Report of the Committee on Economic Consultation and Co-operation, which was appointed as a result of the Imperial Economic Conference held at Ottawa in 1932. The Committee was composed of representatives of the Governments of the United Kingdom, of the Dominions, of India and of Southern Rhodesia, as well as a representative of the Colonies appointed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.2. The Committee&apos;s task was to consider the means of facilitating economic consultation and co-operation between the several Governments of the Common-wealth, including a survey of the functions, organisation and financial bases of the agencies mentioned in paragraph 2 of the Report, and an examination of what alterations or modifications, if any, in the existing machinery for such co-operation within the Commonwealth were desirable.3. A summary of the Committee&apos;s main recommendations will be found in paragraph 358. Before examining certain of these recommendations in particular, it may be useful to make certain observations of a general character.4. It will be observed that the Report does not contain proposals for setting up a comprehensive form of machinery for consultation upon economic questions of common interest to the various parts of the Empire. When therefore the Report is published it is possible that there may be some criticism on the ground that the opportunity for further constructive effort in this direction has passed, without producing more concrete results. In this connexion it is necessary to take account of the existing facts. In the first place, the statements must be borne in mind which the Governments of the Union of South Africa and of the Irish Free State made at the Imperial Economic Conference at Ottawa: These statements were recorded in the Report of the Committee set up by that Conference to examine methods of economic co-operation. The representatives of these two Governments were necessarily bound in their recent deliberations by these decisions which, it will be observed, the Committee have had reproduced at the beginning of their Report in paragraph 4. In the second place, the representa-tives of these Governments were supported in their attitude by the representative of Canada, although that Government had not itself made any reservation of this kind at Ottawa.5. The statements referred to above were to the effect, in the case of South Africa, that while the Union Government were not generally adverse to the institution of ad hoc bodies for economic investigation and preparation, they would not associate themselves with any scheme for the erection of any organisation in the nature of a permanent Secretariat or preparatory committee to Commonwealth conferences, whether economic or otherwise.   Further, theyThe Committee&apos;s Task.[8644]B
made it clear that they were not committed, in principle, to giving financial assistance to Commonwealth economic organisations. In the case of the Irish Free State, it was made perfectly clear that that Government were not prepared to contemplate the setting up of an Imperial Economic Secretariat, or of any similar organ of centralisation.6. It was apparent during the deliberations, of the present Committee that the Canadian Delegation favoured a degree of co-operation even more limited than that which the South African and the Irish Free State Delegations were prepared to&apos; accept. They were completely opposed to any form of central body and they&apos; were persuaded to accept the measure of co-operation eventually agreed upon only after prolonged and difficult negotiation.7. : On the other hand, the United Kingdom representatives, laying emphasis upon the desirability of following up the policy of co-operation in accordance with the, principles agreed upon at the Imperial Economic Conference at Ottawa, made it clear from the outset that the United Kingdom Government were prepared for a full measure of co-operation with the other parts of the Commonwealth. They stated expressly that, in &quot;any Imperial body that might be set up, they were in favour of complete equality of status and of representation, and that (on the understanding that the finances were shared in whatever might be the appropriate proportions) they would agree to freedom from control by the United Kingdom Treasury. They explained, in this connexion, that such control had been insisted upon in the case of the Empire Marketing Board because the funds of that body were provided entirely by the United Kingdom Government. They also made it plain that the United Kingdom Government would be prepared to collaborate on some central body set up for the purpose of supervising the work of such inter-Imperial bodies as might be decided upon, such a body to be available for purposes of economic consultation if the Governments of the Commonwealth so desired.8. The United Kingdom Delegation were supported in their attitude by the representatives of Australia, New Zealand, India and the Colonies in particular, who all favoured close co-operation and the establishment of some form of central body.9. : In view of this diversity of opinion, the question arose whether the committee&apos;s report should disclose that such disagreement existed, or whether the report should be confined to setting out the measure of agreement which had been reached. The United Kingdom representatives felt that, if there were an indica-tioh in the report that the United Kingdom Government had been prepared to go a long way towards the setting up of a central body, that Government would have ah effective answer to criticism that a great opportunity had been let slip. On the other hand, there would have been disclosed to the world a failure on the part of the Governments of the Commonwealth to reach agreement on this question. For this reason and because in the long run it might be easier to induce the hesitating Governments to take the next step if the United Kingdom Government did not on this occasion seem to be placing upon them the blame for failure to make greater immediate progress, there seemed to be much to be said in favour of limiting the report to an indication of the extent of the agreement reached. The question was discussed informally between the United Kingdom Delegation and the Delegations of Australia, India and the Colonies (the New Zealand repre-sentative was not available), and it was agreed that the report should represent what had been agreed upon and not what was the subject of disagreement.10. In all the circumstances it may, I think, be fairly counted as a very considerable achievement on the part of the Committee to have arrived at the signature of a unanimous Report on matters affecting so many divergent interests.11. No doubt opportunity will be found to discuss the general recommenda-tions of the Report with the representatives of the Governments concerned who are attending the World Economic Conference, and, indeed, I understand that Mr. Bennett is in favour of this. In view, however, of the fact that all the Delegations, and in particular the Canadian, South African and Irish Free State Delegations, were known to have kept in the closest touch with their own Govern-ments throughout the progress of the work of the Committee, it is yery doubtful whether general consent could be obtained among the Governments of the Empire for the adoption of measures wider than those contained in the Report, which are
themselves the result of a compromise arrived at only after negotiations of con-siderable duration, difficulty and delicacy. Whilst, therefore, I, personally regret that ife was not found possible to reach agreement for the establishment of, some central body that would provide a more regular means of consultation on Imperial economic questions than exists to-day, I think that we must proceed on the basis that the Committee&apos;s recommendations are the most that are likely to be accepted by the Governments of the Empire  IS 9j whole. H;&apos;12. I ought perhaps to explain that, towards the end of.the Committee&apos;s deliberations, the United Kingdom representatives were able to secure a definite advance in the measure of agreement that seemed likely. The Committee were already prepared to recommend that the Executive Council of the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux and the Imperial Economic Committee should take over certain of the functions of the Empire Marketing Board, but thanks to the support which other Delegations afforded to the United Kingdom Delegation, agreement was reached further that both these enlarged bodies should be given the power, within certain limits, to initiate proposals in connexion with the discharge of their functions.13. This freedom to initiate proposals, coupled with the recognition of the principle, which it will be seen from paragraph 354 has been recognized, that the financing of these two bodies with their extended functions, in addition to the financing of the Imperial Shipping Committee, should be shared on an inter-Imperial basis, may serve to provide the nucleus of some more comprehensive body should the Governments of the Commonwealth in the course of time be prepared to waive their objections to the setting up of any central organisation.14. It is also satisfactory to note that not only was the principle agreed that the financing referred to in the preceding paragraph should be shared, but that it was possible to reach agreement in detail as to the actual scale upon which each part of the Empire concerned should contribute to the cost.The Empire Marketing Board.15. The matter of most immediate practical importance, from the point of view of the United Kingdom, is the position of the Empire Marketing Board, for whose work financial provision has only been made until the end of September 1933. It will be remembered that the Board was set up (with funds provided solely by the United Kingdom Exchequer) as an alternative to the grant to the Dominions of extended Imperial preferences. The change in our fiscal policy created a wholly different position, and there is no longer any case for the continuance of the Board unless the Dominions are prepared to support it by appropriate contributions. The Report of the present Committee indicates that such support is not forthcoming. The results which the Board has secured have been a valuable demonstration of the value of co-operation among the nations of the Empire in the economic field, have created certainly in the United Kingdom and to a less extent elsewhere an atmosphere of practical preference for Empire goods, and have also shown the importance of a co-ordinated survey of research &apos; activities on inter-Imperial lines. The Australian Delegation, in particular, expressed their appreciation of the value of the services rendered by the Board.. Some of the services financed by the Board are, however, of preponderant interest-to the United Kingdom alone, or to the Colonial Empire, and it was hardly to be expected that the representatives of other parts of the Empire would be prepared to assume a share of financial responsibility for functions of this nature. In a number of cases the Dominions maintain their own marketing organisations in this country, and they apparently prefer to finance their efforts at furthering the sale of their products in this way rather than by contributing to a central agency. I understand that during the discussions on the present Committee the Dominion representatives did not question the reasonableness of the United Kingdom intimation (made in view of the changed fiscal position) that we could not. continue to finance the Board unaided.16. As indicated in paragraph 358 of the Committee&apos;s Report, it is recommended that a limited number of the functions of the Empire Marketing-Board should be taken over by two existing bodies, the Imperial Economic[8644] b 2
Committee and the Executive Council of the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux. A decision as to, what research activities in the United Kingdom hitherto promoted and in part financed by the Board should be in future conducted on a co-operative basis is postponed for the moment. A conference consisting of, among other persons, the administrative and scientific heads of national research organisations and departments is to be summoned as early as possible to consider this question. In view of the difficulties in the way of the meeting of such a conference in the immediate future, the Committee recommend that the Executive Council of the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux should be invited to consider the question immediately, and to prepare a report for presentation, either to the suggested conference or direct to the Governments of the Commonwealth.17. If the Cabinet generally is satisfied that it is both useless and inexpedient to press at present for the establishment of some kind of central Imperial organization, it is necessary for a decision to be reached as to the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom both to the Empire Marketing Board and to the maintenance, cessation or transfer of its activities in detail.18. For my part, much as I shall regret the disappearance of the Empire Marketing Board in view of the undoubtedly good work which it has done, and the spirit of Empire co-operation which it has fostered, I see no practicable alternative but to arrange for the Board, as now constituted, to come to an end on the 30th September, 1933, and, if the Committee&apos;s Report is adopted by the Governments of the Empire, I should propose to arrange for the necessary steps to be taken for those functions of the Board whose continuance is recommended (see (b) on page 92 of the Report) to be transferred as from the 1st October, 1933, to the Imperial Economic Committee, and for the work of &quot;winding up &quot; the remainder of the Board&apos;s activities to be put in hand. I ought not, however, to make this recommendation without also calling the attention of my colleagues to the initiative and vision shown by Sir S. Tallents, the Secretary of the Board, and to the zeal and enthusiasm of the staff which has worked under him.1.9. If this general recommendation is approved, it will&apos;be, of course, for those Departments of the United Kingdom Government more especially concerned, to examine the provision now made from the Empire Marketing Fund for the services which will be discontinued on the termination of the existence of the Empire Marketing Board, and to take such action in regard to them, in consultation with the Treasury, as may seem desirable.Other A gencies referred to.,20. The Report deals with various matters relating to the other bodies included within its scope, such, for instance, as the Imperial Institute, which will require further consideration by the Departments most directly concerned, and may possibly require further reference to the Cabinet at a later stage. For the time being, I suggest that it will be sufficient for the Report to be examined by the Departments concerned, with a view to considering to what extent the recommen-dations in question (i.e., apart from that relating to the Empire Marketing Board) should be carried into effect so far as His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are concerned. A decision on these questions will, however, be required at a fairly early date, since, as soon as the Report is published, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom will no doubt be expected to define their attitude towards its x^recommendations.Publication of Report.21. As regards the publication of their Report, the Committee agreed as follows : (a) that each Delegation on the Committee should be responsible for sending to its Government the final text of the Report;(b) that each of the Governments represented on the Committee should beinformed, when the Report is sent to them in accordance with (a) above,
that it is proposed that, in the,absence of objections by any Govern-.: ,. ment, there should be simultaneous publication on a date which would allow an interval of one week between the date of; arrival of the printed text of the Report in the farthest Dominion&quot; and its publication in the several parts of the Commonwealth.The Report is not, therefore, likely to be published before the eud of May, and the Canadian Government is taking the initiative as regards arrangements for its simultaneous publication; ;       !22.   To recapitulate Paragraphs 1 to 11 of this memorandum are introductory; they explain the divergencies of opinion which arose in the Committee, and the reasons why the United Kingdom Delegation concentrated on obtaining a Report representing what was agreed upon and not what was the subject of disagreement.Paragraphs 12, 13 and 14 deal with the Committee&apos;s proposals as to the enlarged functions of the Executive Council of the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux, and of the Imperial Economic Committee.Paragraphs 15 and 16 deal with the future of the Empire Marketing Board, and paragraphs 17 and 19 contain my recommendation as to the action to be taken with regard to the Board.Paragraph 20 deals with the existing inter-Imperial agencies whose continuation is not recommended.Paragraph 21 relates to publication of the Report.23.   The immediate questions on which a decision is required are: (1) whether arrangements are to be made for the Empire Marketing Board as at present constituted to come to an end on the 30th September, 1933.(2) whether, if the Governments of the Empire adopt the Committee&apos;s Report, the functions of the Empire Marketing Board, whose continuance is recommended, are to be transferred as from the 1st October, 1933, to the Imperial Economic Committee, and steps taken for the remainder of the Board&apos;s activities to be &quot; wound up.&quot;24i. It is further proposed that the Departments of the United Kingdom Government more especially concerned (a) should examine the provision now made from the Empire MarketingFund for the services which will be discontinued with a view to such action, in consultation with the Treasury, as may seem desirable in regard to them.(b) should consider to what extent the recommendations, apart from those relating to the Empire Marketing Board, should be carried into effect so far as His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are concerned.J.

7115INTRODUCTORY(i) Origin of the Committee and its terms of reference the Committee owes its origin to, and derives its terms of reference from, a resolution of the Imperial Economic Conference held at Ottawa in 1932. This resolution which was adopted after discussion of the question of economic consultation and co-operation within the Commonwealth, and after consideration of the report of the committee of the Conference dealing with methods of economic co-operation, recommended the appointment forthwith of a committee consisting of not more than two representatives of each of the participating Governments with the following terms of reference :  ;&quot; to consider the means of facilitating economic consultation and co-operation between the several Governments of the Common-wealth, including a survey of the functions, organisation, and financial bases of the agencies specified in the annexed report, and an examination of what alterations or modifications, if any, in the existing machinery for such co-operation within the Commonwealth are desirable &quot;.2. In explanation of the words &quot; agencies specified in the annexed report &quot; it is necessary to quote the relevant passage from the report of the Committee on Methods of Economic Co-operation, which reads as follows : &quot; The following is believed to be an exhaustive list of such organisations : (i) The Imperial Economic Committee.(ii) The Imperial Shipping Committee.(iii) The Empire Marketing Board.(iv) The Executive Council of the Imperial AgriculturalBureaux.(v) The Imperial Institute.(vi) The Imperial Institute of Entomology.(vii) The Imperial Mycological Institute.(viii) The Imperial Communications Advisory Committee.(ix) The Oversea Mechanical Transport Council.(x) The Imperial Forestry Institute.(xi) The Empire Timbers Committee.Mention may also conveniently be made of the following bodies : The Bureau of Hygiene and Tropical Diseases, which, though scarcely within the economic field proper, derives part of its income from Empire Governments ;
sThe Wool Industries Research Association, towards which certain Governments individually contribute ;The Empire Cotton Growing Corporation which is partly financed out of a capital fund of  1,000,000 contributed by the United Kingdom Government and partly by a statutory levy, carried out by the Customs authorities on imports of cotton into the United Kingdom ;The Standing Committee on Empire Forestry whose main function is to maintain continuity of action between meetings of the British Empire Forestry Conference i.e., in effect to make the necessary preparations for successive conferences.&quot;3. The resolution of the Conference instructed the Committee to elect their Chairman from among their own members, and to report to the several Governments represented thereon not later than the 31st May, 1933. In subsequent correspondence between the partici-pating Governments it was agreed that the Committee should, if possible, complete their report by the 31st March, 1933.4. It is desirable to reproduce here the reservations made at Ottawa by Mr. Havenga for the Union of South Africa and by Mr. Lemass for the Irish Free State with regard to the above-mentioned resolution of the Conference.(Mr. Havenga) : &quot; While not wishing to object to the accept-ance of the report of the Committee on Methods of Economic Co-operation, I desire, in order to remove any ground for misapprehension, to record the following reservations on behalf of the Union of South Africa : &quot; (1) While not generally adverse to the institution of ad hoc bodies for economic investigation and preparation, the Union Government will not associate itself with any scheme for the erection of any organisation in the nature of a permanent secretariat or preparatory committee to Commonwealth Conferences, whether economic or otherwise.&quot; (2) That portion of the report which introduces the draft resolutions relating to the appointment of a Committee to consider the means of facilitating economic consultation and co-operation, must not be read in the sense that the Union Government is committed in principle to give financial support to Commonwealth economic organisations.&quot;(Mr. Lemass) : &quot; I do not object to the adoption of this report and the accompanying resolutions, but I wish it to be made perfectly clear in the published records of the Conference that the Government of the Irish Free State are not prepared to contemplate the setting up of an Imperial Economic Secretariat or of any similar organ of centralisation.&quot;
5. It devolved upon His Majesty&apos;s Government in Canada as the conveners of the Ottawa Conference to convene the Committee. In this connection, consultation took place between the various Govern-ments as to the participation of the Government of Southern Rhodesia, whose representatives had also been present at the Ottawa Con-ference, and of the Colonial Empire. It was agreed that the Govern-ment of Southern Rhodesia should be invited to nominate one representative, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom should be invited to nominate one representative of the Colonial Empire.(ii) Procedure adopted by the committee. In accordance with the invitations issued by His Majesty&apos;s Government in Canada, we held our opening meeting at Canada House, London, on the 14th February, 1933. We were welcomed on behalf of the Canadian Government by the Honourable G. Howard Ferguson, High Commissioner in London, who invited us to proceed to the election of a chairman from among our members. On the proposal of Major-General Sir Fabian Ware on behalf of the United Kingdom delegation, seconded by Mr. F. L. McDougall on behalf of the delegation of the Commonwealth of Australia, we unanimously elected Dr. O. D. Skelton, delegate of the Canadian Government, as our Chairman. Dr. Skelton then took the chair.7. The Chairman informed the Committee that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom had indicated that if it would be of convenience to the Committee they were willing to provide any facilities that might be required in the way of clerical assistance, and also, if desired, to provide office accommodation, and on his proposal the Committee decided to accept this offer.8. The Committee agreed that there should be a joint secretariat, members of which should be nominated by any delegation that desired to do so. On this basis the Committee then proceeded to appoint the following secretariat : Mr.  Francis Hemming,  C.B.E.,  Joint  Secretary,  economic advisory Council (United Kingdom) ; Mr. L. B. Pearson, Department of External Affairs (Canada) ; Mr. P. Liesching, C.M.G., Dominions Office (United Kingdom).9. The Committee further agreed that their subsequent meetings should be held at 2, Whitehall Gardens, London.10. We decided first to undertake a detailed survey of the existing agencies for co-operation referred to in our terms of reference ; and then to pass to the consideration of what alterations or modifications,
if any, appeared desirable. We should then, we hoped, be in a position both to formulate our recommendations in regard to the existing agencies and to state our conclusions on the more general aspects of the problem referred to us. In accordance with this plan we invited each of these agencies to submit a written precis setting out their respective constitutions, functions, and financial bases. With this valuable material at our disposal we invited representatives from these institutions to give oral evidence before us for the elucidation of points on which we desired further information.11. In addition, we invited one of our members, Sir Fabian Ware, in his capacity as Vice-Chairman of the Imperial War Graves Commission, to give us information on the financial and administrative organisation of the Commission. This was not one of the agencies specified in our terms of reference, but we thought that its experience might provide suggestions of value to us. A summary of the principal points elicited in this evidence is given separately in an appendix in which is included also a draft charter submitted by Sir Fabian Ware in response to an inquiry as to how, in his judgment, the charter and constitution of the Commission could be adapted to the require-ments of such a body as the Committee might find it useful to consider. To our great regret, we were deprived hi the course of our work of the services of Mr. John Sanderson, one of the delegates of the Commonwealth of Australia, who was obliged to tender his resignation owing to ill-health.(iii) Arrangement of report12. In preparing our report we have thought it convenient to set out in Part 1 the facts elicited in evidence with regard to the organisation, functions and financial bases of the existing agencies for inter-Imperial &apos;o-operation specified in our terms of reference. In Part 2 we set out the proposals for the alterations or modifications in those agencies which in the light of the evidence we consider desirable. In Part 3 we pass to the general principles which, in our opinion, are fundamental to a consideration of the questions referred to us and state our conclusions and recommendations with regard to future forms of consultation and co-operation within the British Commonwealth.13. A full list of the witnesses who gave oral evidence before us is given in appendix 1 and we desire here to express our grateful thanks for the assistance we received from them. In appendix 2 we give certain statistical notes relevant to our inquiry. In appendix 3 we give a summary of the principal points elicited in evidence relating to the financial and administrative organisation of the Imperial War Graves Commission, together with a draft charter submitted by the Vice-Chairman of the Commission.
14. We held in all twenty-three meetings. Our concluding session was held on Tuesday, 11th April, 1933.15. We desire to express our deep appreciation of the invaluable services rendered by the Secretariat. Their work has been a fine instance of the co-operation which we are seeking&apos;to promote and only through their skill and unflagging energy has it been possible in the time at our disposal to analyse and collate the mass of evidence and documents under review. We wish to express our gratitude also to the clerical and typing staff for their untiring and expert services.
PART ISURVEY  OF  THE  FUNCTIONS,   ORGANISATION,  AND FINANCIAL BASES OF EXISTING INTER-IMPERIAL AGENCIES16. We propose now to give, in as succinct a form as possible, a survey of the inter-Imperial agencies referred to in our terms of reference. These are set out in detail in the report of the Committee on Methods of Economic Co-operation of the Imperial Economic Conference, Ottawa, which is reproduced as appendix 5 to the summary of proceedings of that Conference, where eleven bodies are enumerated. This list is reproduced in paragraph 2 of our report. Reference is also made in the Ottawa report to four other bodies as possibly falling within the scope of our inquiry. Of these, we have taken evidence in regard to two, namely, the Bureau of Hygiene and Tropical Diseases and the Standing Committee on Empire Forestry. The former performs functions in the medical field analogous to those discharged by the other Imperial bureaux in the agricultural field. The latter is a governmental committee, and as such seems to come within the scope of our investigation. The other bodies mentioned, namely, the Wool Industries Research Association, and the Empire Cotton Growing Corporation, are non-governmental agencies, and we have, therefore, excluded them from consideration.17. We desire to preface our survey by emphasising that so far as possible we have refrained in this part of our report from expressing our opinion on the merits of particular organisations, preferring rather at this stage to confine ourselves to outlining the evidence submitted to us. Our views on each organisation are given in Part 2 of our report.I.-THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL OF THE IMPERIAL AGRICULTURAL BUREAUX(a) The constitution of the Executive Council18. The Executive Council is an inter-Imperial body charged with the supervision of the eight Imperial Agricultural Bureaux which collect and disseminate information in regard to certain of the agricultural sciences. The Council consists of eleven members, each directly appointed by one or other of the subscribing governments. In one point only does its composition differ from the latest con-stitutional definition, i.e., in the fact that the United Kingdom is not represented by a single representative but by a representative of each of the Departments of Agriculture in the United Kingdom (i.e., the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Departments of Agriculture for Scotland and for Northern Ireland).
(b) The functions of the Executive Council19. The functions of the Council are mainly administrative and financial. Where the Dominion representative cannot attend in person, arrangements are made (a) for the appointment of a sub-stitute member, and (b) for the circulation of papers to the Dominion representative in time to enable him to convey his own views to the Council.20. The Council possess an annual income derived from sub-prescriptions by the participating governments of  20,000 per annum. This sum was fixed on the formation of the Council, when it was assumed that there need be no increase in annual contributions for at least the first five years. Owing to the fact that some of the bureaux were not set up as rapidly as others, expenditure fell con-siderably short of income in the first year, and it was possible to build up a reserve fund which now amounts to  12,800. Owing to the natural growth of the expenditure of the bureaux (mainly owing to increments of salary for the staff, but in part also to the creation of additional posts), it would probably by now have been necessary to draw upon the reserve fund to meet current expenses had it not been for two circumstances, viz., economy cuts in the salaries of the scientific staff, and increased receipts obtained from the sales of the abstracting journals. It is now anticipated that no increased pro-vision will be necessary in the second five-year period, growth in expenditure during that period being met from the reserve fund.21. It was originally contemplated that the future finance of the bureaux (including the question of increased contributions) would form the subject of discussion at a further Imperial Agricultural Research Conference, but as this conference has not been held, the question of the method by which the Council should approach the contributing governments in regard to the future rates of subscription has not yet been determined.22. In spite of the financial difficulties of recent years, sub-prescriptions have been received in full from all the participating governments, though in some cases payments have been slow in coming in. Clear indications have, however, been received in several cases that the payment.of subscriptions by (say) one Dominion is conditional upon the other Dominions continuing their subscriptions on the agreed scale. Each government is, of course, free to determine its&apos; own subscription each year, but the experience of the Council suggests a growing sense of mutual responsibility for the maintenance of support for the bureaux.(c) The constitutional position of the staff of the Council and thebureaux:23. The secretary of the Council is also the secretary of the Imperial Economic Committee. In neither capacity is he in the direct employment of the Crown under any one of the constituent
governments of the Empire. Officials in the various bureaux are not Civil Servants, but are appointed direct by the Council itself. They do not enjoy any of the superannuation rights of Civil Servants. They provide for their pensions by subscribing to the contributory scheme established for University staffs in the United Kingdom.(d) The accounts of the Council24. The Council prepare their own accounts which they submit to the subscribing governments through their representatives on the Council. By an arrangement made by the Council, these accounts are audited by the United Kingdom Comptroller and Auditor General. They do not appear in any part of the public accounts of any portion of the Empire, the only reference to the Council on Parliamentary Votes in the United Kingdom, or in the Dominions, being found on whatever Vote the subscription given to the Council by that govern-ment is placed. Similarly the United Kingdom Parliament, for example, can only discuss the position of the Council when considering the sub-head of the Vote of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries or the Department of Agriculture for Scotland, on which the English and Scottish subscriptions appear.(e) Possible developments in the constitutional position of the Council25. The experience of the Council is that the method by which it is constituted directly by the participating governments is conducive to efficiency. They are not conscious of any need for the modification of their constitution. They expressed the hope that full consideration would be given to the fact that they attach importance to the maintenance of a single fund especially earmarked by contributing governments for the purposes of the bureaux.(f) The relation of the Council to the bureaux26. The Council believe that the directors of the several bureaux are perfectly satisfied with the present organisation and that they find no difficulty in the conduct of their scientific work by reason of the fact that the financial and administrative control to which they are subject is exercised by a lay, and not a scientific, body. The bureaux have found no difficulty in establishing contacts with government departments and Universities. In this they have been helped by the fact that the three United Kingdom representatives are all heads of departments of agriculture in different parts of the United Kingdom. The individual bureaux do not have scientific advisory committees of their own, but it should be remembered that their staffs are situated in institutes containing numbers of scientific workers with whom they can discuss their problems. In addition, periodical meetings are held at which all the directors of the bureaux are present. In a sense, these meetings constitute a scientific advisory committee for the Executive Council.
27. The institutes at which the bureaux are located were selected either by the Imperial Agricultural Research Conference of 1927, or by the organising committee in the following year. They all happen to be in Great Britain, but the bureaux have always been kept distinct from the institutes in which they are located. As a result, if occasion should arise they could be transferred to other institutes in another part of the Empire. Various suggestions for the creation of additional bureaux have at times been put forward (e.g., for a Meteorological Bureau and for a Dairying Bureau), but the Executive Council have taken the view that the decision to set up new bureaux should be taken, not by them or on their recommendation, but on the recommendation of some future Imperial Agricultural Research Conference.(g) The value of the work of the bureaux28. The bureaux fulfil a very real need in the special branches of science with which they are concerned. In modern conditions no worker in any of these fields can hope to keep abreast of develop-merits in his science without the assistance of some abstracting bureau or similar organisation. This is due to various causes, notably the great increase in the number of scientific journals, the increase in the number of workers, and the much greater variety of languages in which scientific papers are now published. We received ample evidence to show the value of these bureaux to all parts of the Commonwealth.29. One bureau or group of bureaux may be of greater value to one of the subscribing governments than other bureaux. Never-theless, whenever a suggestion has been made that financial exigencies seemed likely to necessitate the closing of a bureau, because its work was of comparatively little interest to some Dominion, it has always been found that the work of that bureau is of very great interest to some other Dominion or Dominions.30. Various abstracting journals relating to some aspects of the subjects covered by the eight agricultural bureaux are published in various parts of the world, but none cover the field so fully. The work of the agricultural bureaux is more thorough, more specialised, and more definitely directed to the study of particular subjects of interest to agricultural research workers than that done in the inter-national field.31. Each bureau has a free list of institutions and persons in the Empire to whom its publications are sent. This list is settled by the Executive Council in consultation with the director of the bureau. As regards the Dominions, the Executive Council are mainly guided by the advice received from the official correspondent of the bureau in that Dominion.
32. One of the advantages of establishing the bureaux in existing research institutes is that this, enables them to do their work at much less cost than would otherwise be possible, as they have the benefit of the specialist libraries, etc., of the institutes. The Council consider that this system is greatly preferable to any method that attempted to centralise the scientific work of the bureaux.II. THE IMPERIAL INSTITUTE OF ENTOMOLOGY(a) Its constitution and management(i) The stages of its growth33. The origin of the Institute is to be found in the Entomological Research Committee, appointed in 1909 to deal with entomological problems in tropical Africa. Of the funds required for that committee,  2,000 per annum, one half was provided by the governments of the African dependencies concerned, and the other half by the United Kingdom Government. In 1911, the committee was reconstituted under the title of the Imperial Bureau of Entomology, and its functions extended to cover all parts of the Empire. In 1930 the title of the organisation was changed to the Imperial Institute of Entomology.(ii) The constitution of the managing body34. When the Bureau as such came into existence in 1911, the previous Entomological Research Committee became the committee of management of the Bureau. The committee consisted of (a). men of science, (b) representatives of three United Kingdom departments, (c) the chief entomologists in each Dominion, ex officio, and (d) certain individual members nominated by some oversea governments.(iii) The management of the Institute35. The committee of management normally meets twice annually, its functions including the general direction of the work of the Institute, the appointment of the higher staff, and the preparation of annual reports for the information of the subscribing governments. The day-to-day management is entrusted to the Director.(b) The normal functions of the Institute (i.e., those functions financed on an inter-Imperial basis)36. The Institute performs two main functions. In the first place, it acts as a clearing house for the rapid dissemination of the results of entomological work of economic importance carried out in all parts of the world. Secondly, it undertakes the identification of insects of economic importance received from the Dominions and Colonies.
37. In neither of these fields is there any overlapping of function with other bodies in the Empire, the entomological services of which direct their energies mainly to the solution of entomological problems of local importance, while the Institute supplies facilities (by its publications and identification service) for this work. It should be added that in many cases it is very desirable from the scientific point of view that a single problem should be attacked simultaneously from different angles under the different conditions found in various parts of the Empire.(i) Its clearing house ftmctions38. The Institute performs its clearing house functions mainly through the publication of the following journals :-(1) Review of Applied Entomology. This is a monthly journal containing reviews and abstracts of every book or article bearing on injurious insects published throughout the world. In this field of science, there exists no abstracting journal comparable either in scope or in rapidity of publication. It puts in the hands of economic entomologists in the minimum time the latest developments in their science.(2) Bulletin of Entomological Research. This is a quarterly journal for the publication of original articles dealing with liarmful insects.(3) The Insecta division of the Zoological Record. This is an annual publication containing the titles of all entomological papers published in the previous year, giving a concise subject index and a list of all new-named forms. No similar publication in this field is published in any part of the world, and it is absolutely essential for every entomologist dealing with the identification of insects.(ii) Its insect identification functions39. The first requirement of economic entomologists is the correct identification of the insects with which they deal. Such identification-tion can only be carried out at centres possessing (a) extensive collections of correctly named specimens ; (6) a large scientific library.In both respects, the British Museum (Natural History) is probably without rival, and it is for this reason that this part of the work must be carried out in that institution.(c) The inter-Imperial financial basis of the normal work of theInstitute40. Financial contributions other than those from the United Kingdom and the African Colonies were first received in 1913 on the extension of the functions of the Bureau to cover all parts of the Empire.   The total income of the Bureau then amounted to
 5,000 per annum. In spite of the growth in its work and the rise in the cost of living and in prices, its income remained unchanged till 1920, when the whole position of the Bureau was reviewed by the First Imperial Entomological Conference, which submitted a report to the various participating governments, recommending that by means of increased subscriptions the income of the Bureau should be raised to  13,000 per annum. These recommendations were accepted by all the governments with the exception of India, whose con-tribution remained unchanged. Owing to the present economic depression, certain Dominions have had to reduce temporarily their contributions. Increased sums have, however, been received from the United Kingdom and from some of the Colonies. The present income of the Institute from government contributions amounts to between  11,000 and  12,000.41. As regards the basis of assessment, it should be explained that-(a) each Dominion subscribes whatever sum it considers appropriate, or, at the present time, feels itself able to pay ;(b) in the case of the Colonies, the Secretary of State has a considerable voice in settling the amount of the annual con-tributions.42. Small contributions are received annually also from Egypt, Siam, and Iraq in recognition of the services rendered by the Institute in the work of disseminating information and similar services.43. The subscriptions of participating governments are paid to, and are held by, the Crown Agents for the Colonies. The accounts are audited by the Director of Colonial Audit. As the Institute is not a United Kingdom, but an inter-Imperial, institution, its accounts are not submitted to the United Kingdom Parliament.(d) The functions of the Institute performed wholly at the cost of the Empire Marketing Board44, In 1927, the Empire Marketing Board provided the funds necessary for (a) the foundation, and (b) the maintenance of a laboratory at Farnham Royal under the direction of the Institute. This laboratory, which is available for all the Dominions and Colonies, is staffed by specialists in methods of biological control, i,e., the control of insect pests to agriculture and forestry by means of beneficial parasites and predators. Various important insect pests have been studied at the laboratory, and large exports of beneficial parasites have been made to the Dominions and Colonies free of charge. The initial capital cost (covered by a special Empire Marketing Board grant) of the laboratory amounted to  15,000. The Board&apos;s maintenance grant for the first six years amounted to  5,000 per annum.   In 1932, this was reduced to  4,000.   No
provision has been made for the continuance of any part of the income of the laboratory after September next, when the present financial provision for the Empire Marketing Board comes to an end.(e) Miscellaneous activities o! the Institute45. The Institute performs a number of advisory functions and a certain number of duties on a repayment basis. The latter include the superintendence of the locust investigations in Africa and western Asia and also special field investigations undertaken at the request of particular governments. Work is also undertaken when opportunity arises on behalf, and at the expense, of planters, etc., in regard to particular insect pests. It is hoped that when the value of entomology becomes more fully realised, this branch of the Instituted work will increase and that it may be possible ultimately to build up a reserve fund out of the fees charged on a professional basis.46. Of the total normal expenditure of the Institute, five-sixths is represented by the salaries of the scientific and subordinate staff engaged on either (i) the preparation of the three journals published b3&apos; the Institute, or (ii) the identification of insects received.47. These are both essential functions of the Institute which remain substantially unchanged from year to year. Of the remainder of the normal expenditure the balance is made up of the deficit on -the publication of the journals, office expenses, library, etc.48. The facilities at the laboratory provided by the Empire Marketing Board do, however, lend themselves to planning, and the programme of work was approved by the Empire Marketing Board, by whom the funds were provided.49. In addition to the above work at the laboratory which is performed free of charge as falling within the programme approved by the Empire Marketing Board, ad hoc investigations are undertaken, so far as the resources of the laboratory permit, at the request of particular governments. In these cases the out-of-pocket expenses (but not overhead charges) are repaid to the Institute by the government concerned.(f) An assessment of the value of the work of the Institute to particular parts of the Empire50. The value of the two main branches of the normal duties of the Institute to the various parts of the Empire are : (i) Its clearing house work. Of the two publications of the Institute (the Review and the Bulletin) free copies are distributed to the participating governments. These publications are of very great value to the entomologists serving under those governments, and contain mformation which could not otherwise be published either so fully or so quickly.
(ii) Its insect identification service. This is used in varying degrees by the several parts of the Empire. Broadly speaking, this work is of the greatest value to those Colonies and Dominions that do not possess large entomological services, scientific libraries and museums. They are of least value to Canada, which must rely largely for identification work on the collections at Washington. With the growth of scientific knowledge, especially of obscure groups of economic insects, it is probable that the identification work from the Dominions will tend to increase rather than decrease.III. THE IMPERIAL MYCOLOGICAL INSTITUTE (a) Its constitution and management(i) The origin of the Institute51. The decision to found the Institute (then called a Bureau) was taken in 1918 by the Imperial Conference of that year, but the body did not come into operation until 1920. From its inception, it was intended to serve the Dominions equally with the Colonial Empire.(ii) The constitution of the managing body52. The governing body of the Institute consists of a committee of management appointed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies. This consists of a number of scientists (some of whom are expert mycologists), some United Kingdom officials, and the Chief Mycologist of each Dominion, ex officio. With the exception of the Chief Mycolo-gist of the Irish Free State who can more readily attend, the latter are seldom present and are able to exercise little influence on the management of the Institute.(hi) The management of the Institute53. The committee of management meet normally yearly, when they receive reports from the Director on financial and staff questions, and matters relative to the Instituted journal, together with a technical account of the principal work done during the previous six months. These reports are forwarded to the governments that subscribe to the Institute. The day-to-day management of the Institute is entrusted to the Director, who is assisted by a small finance sub-committee of the committee of management.     &apos;;(b) The functions of the Institute54. The Institute has two main functions, viz., the collection and dissemination of information regarding applied mycology and plant pathology and the identification and study of fungi of economic importance.
(i) The collection and dissemination of information regarding applied mycology and plant pathology55. This part of the work of the Institute is mainly effected through the publication of the Review of Applied Mycology. This contains abstracts of all papers on mycology published in any part of the world and in any language. This journal is indispensable to every working mycologist, for it is impossible for him to keep abreast of his subject in any other way owing to the great number of scientific journals dealing with mycological subjects and the great variety of the languages in which the papers are written. Free copies are sent to all the participating governments.(ii) The identification and study of fungi of economic importance56. This part of the Instituted work consists in the examination and study of material received from the Dominions and Colonies, and forms a large part of the work of the specialist officers of the Institute. It includes investigations in regard to human diseases having a fungus origin, forest mycology, the study of the fungi that attack textiles, and the study of moulds. (The latter have a particular importance in connection with stored produce.) It does not, how-ever, work on yeasts. The Institute does not confine itself to the study of harmful fungi, but studies also beneficial fungi, e.g., fungi parasitic on injurious insects. Of these, a number of consignments have been exported to various parts of the Empire.57. Mycology is a relatively young branch of science and may be expected to increase in importance as its scope becomes more fully understood and the ravages due to fungi more widely appreciated.58. There is no institution doing similar work in any part of the world, a fact which greatly helps the sale of its journal. Close co-operation is maintained, not only with mycologists in the Empire, but also with foreign mycological departments, notably those in the United States.(c) The financial basis of the Institute59. The whole of the income of the Institute is derived either from government contributions or the sale of its journal. The proportions in which the various Dominions and Colonies subscribe to the Institute were fixed at the time of its foundation by negotiation between the Colonial Office (the Dominions Office did not them exist) and the governments concerned.60. The last meeting of the Imperial Mycologicai Conference, to which reference is made in paragraph 69 below, recommended increases in the government subscriptions to the Institute, but owing to the financial crisis, these have not been forthcoming, and
certain existing subscriptions have been reduced or withdrawn. The Institute continues, however, to work for those governments which at the moment are not.paying subscriptions.61. Most of its work is done for governments, but in some cases for planters&apos; associations, etc., such as the Indian Tea Association. No fees are charged by the Institute for this work. The Institute would, however, if requested, be prepared to do particular pieces of work ad hoc for the Dominions and Colonies on a repayment basis.62. The Institute also does a certain amount of work for foreign countries, either because those countries are contiguous to British territories, or because their mycological departments render assis-tance in other ways to the Institute. No charge is made for such work.63. The United Kingdom did not at the outset subscribe to the Institute, which was founded at the request of, and to meet the needs of, the Colonial Empire. In recent years, the United Kingdom have realised the value to them of the work of the Institute, and subscriptions are now received from the Departments of Agriculture in England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.64. The funds of the Institute are held by the Crown Agents for the Colonies, and the accounts are audited by the Director of Colonial Audit, an official appointed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.65. There is a reserve fund (now about  3,000), which is being used to meet deficiencies in income. A sum of  4,000 was taken three years ago from this fund to be added to a sum of  7,000, provided by the Empire Marketing Board for the new buildings of the Institute.66. Of the expenditure of the Institute, over four-fifths is repre-sented by the salaries of the scientific and subordinate staff. The relative cost in terms of salaries of the information (bureau) and investigation sides of the Instituted work are in the proportion of 8 to 9. Of the remaining expenditure of the Institute, the most important item is the deficit on the publication of the Review.,(d) Miscellaneous activities of the Institute67. In an organisation of this kind, mainly dealing with material as received, there is little scope for planning, the work being sub-stantially similar from year to year. In so far, however, as priority is accorded to the treatment of one set of material over another, the decision rests with the Director, who is guided by such informa-tion as he may receive regarding the importance attached to the inquiry by the government concerned.
68. The Director is in constant correspondence with the Chief Mycologists and other officers of mycological departments in the Empire overseas. In this way he is able to keep in close touch with the mycological problems of the Empire and receives guidance in regard to the special needs of particular Dominions and Colonies.69. The main opportunity for planning is provided by the quin-quennial Imperial Mycological Conferences, at -which the Dominions and Colonies are represented by their mycological specialist officers. At these conferences, a full account is given by the Director of the previous five years&apos; work, plans are made for any variations or extensions that may be thought desirable, and recommendations are formulated for consideration by the subscribing governments.(e) An assessment of the value of the work of the Institute to particular parts of the Empire(i) The information service70. All the Dominion and Colonial Governments that possess mycological officers benefit directly from the Institute through the Review of Applied Mycology, copies of which they receive free and which contain a more thorough, complete, and up-to-date survey of current literature on the subject than is published anywhere else in the world.(ii) The identification service71. The value to the several&apos; participating governments of this work may be calculated on several bases, e.g., it might be possible to form a rough estimate measured in terms of the money value of the injuries to crops, etc., prevented, as a result of the Instituted work. A more rough and ready estimate could be obtained by an analysis of the number of. inquiries received or the amount of work done, measured in time and money spent thereon. An analysis on the third of the above bases shows that of the Instituted time, 55-60 per cent, is normally devoted to the Colonial Empire, 25 per cent, to the Dominions, 7-8 per cent, to India, and 8-9 per cent, to the United Kingdom. With increased realisation of the need for mycological services, these proportions will not necessarily remain the same.IV. THE BUREAU OF HYGIENE AND TROPICAL DISEASES(a) The origin of the Bureau72. The Bureau was established in 1908, under the title of the Sleeping Sickness Bureau, and its functions were limited to the collection and dissemination of information in regard to trypano-somiasis. Four years later, in 1912, the functions of the Bureau were extended to cover all tropical diseases, and its title was changed
to that of the Tropical Diseases Bureau. Finally, in 1926, its functions were further extended to cover the whole of hygiene in addition to tropical diseases and a further change of its title was made, the name Bureau of Hygiene and Tropical Diseases now in use being then adopted. At the present time, the hygiene functions of the Bureau slightly exceed those in regard to tropical diseases.(b) The work and organisation of the Bureau73. The Bureau conducts no research, its functions being entirely confined to the dissemination of information. This it does in two ways. In the first place, it publishes two bulletins, the Tropical Diseases Bulletin and the Bulletin of Hygiene, both of which are monthly publications. Formerly, it published, also, a tropical veterinary bulletin, but this was discontinued when the veterinary work was transferred to the Imperial Bureau of Animal Health, established in accordance with a recommendation of the Imperial Agricultural Research Conference of 1927. Copies of the Bureau&apos;s publications are sent free to the governments of the contributing Colonies, and to those of the Dominions that have come into the scheme. In addition, a limited number of free copies are sent to certain governments that formerly subscribed to the Bureau but which have been forced to withdraw their subscriptions by reason of hard times. An annual revenue of about  1,500 is obtained by the sale ,of the Bureau&apos;s publications. The second method by which the Bureau disseminates information is by furnishing replies to inquiries received direct. These come from all parts of the world, and no charge is made for the information given.74. The Bureau is managed by a committee appointed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies. The personnel of the committee is mainly professional and medical in character, though the committee contains representatives of the Colonial Office, the Ministry of Health, the Foreign Office (for the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan), and a veterinary surgeon. The committee does not at present contain direct representatives of any of the Dominions or Colonies.75. The committee meets normaUy three times a year, to discuss such questions of general policy as may arise, e.g., whether or not to start a new journal such as the Bulletin of Hygiene, etc. The work of the Bureau does not vary much from year to year, and a large measure of discretion is left to the Director by the committee of management. The Bureau does not issue annual reports, but from time to time produces special reports for the information of the participating governments.76. The present income of the Bureau is about  8,300 per annum, of which,  6,135 is made up of contributions from the governments of different parts of the Empire, and the remainder represents receipts from sales of the Bureau&apos;s publications.
12477. The Bureau was formerly housed in the building of the Imperial Institute. The accommodation available was, however, very limited, and when expansion became imperative, arrangements were made for the Bureau to be given house room by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. This arrangement is of great advantage both to the Bureau and the School. The library of the Bureau is now incorporated with that of the School and several of the members of the teaching staff at the School work for the Bureau.78. The work performed by the Bureau on the tropical medicine side (which, as stated in paragraph 72 above, represents rather less than half of the total activities of the Bureau) is of general interest to medical men and local administrations in all parts of the tropics. The information service in regard to hygiene, which represents the greater part of the Bureau&apos;s activities, is of world-wide application, not being confined to the tropics. There is no overlapping between the work of the Bureau and that of any other institution, as the Bureau is the only body that issues journals of abstracts covering the whole field in this branch of applied science.V.-THE IMPERIAL FORESTRY INSTITUTE, OXFORD (a) The origin of the Institute79. The Imperial Forestry Institute was established in 1924 as a result of resolutions passed by the Empire Forestry Conferences of 1920 and 1923. It was intended that it should serve all parts of the Empire Dominions as well as Colonies and should be a centre for (i) higher training, (ii) research, (iii) refresher courses for serving forest officers, and (iv) forestry information-collecting services. These latter developed into the present bureau service.(b) Its constitution and management80. The Board of Management of the Institute consists of eight persons, of whom one half are appointed by Oxford University. The other half consists of representatives nominated by the departments that subscribe to the Institute (i.e., the Colonial Office as representing the subscribing Colonial Governments, and the Forestry Commission), together with a representative of the Empire Forestry Association. Of the eight members, two are expert foresters, one a man of science, and five are laymen, of whom three have no first-hand knowledge of forestry questions.81. The Board meets normally three times a year and is assisted by two committees an Education Committee which deals with staff questions and similar matters, and a Finance Committee. The Director submits his recommendations both to the Committees and to the Board.   In regard to details he is given a free hand.
82. The staff consists of the Director and a number of lecturers. Of these, one served for many years in South Africa and three have had long, experience in India.(c) The functions of the Institute(i) Training functions83. The training functions of the Institute are of two kinds. In the first place, there is a post-graduate course for prospective forest officers. The students are required to have taken either a degree in forestry at an approved school of forestry or a general science degree. Some of them also take the University diploma in forestry at Oxford, as the Institute itself does not give a diploma. It issues, however, certificates of attendance, if asked to do so. The subjects taught include aspects of systematic botany and sylviculture of special interest to the Empire, engineering, forest management, etc. An important part of the course consists of tours in long-conserved forests on the continent of Europe. Last year there were twenty-two students at the Institute, a smaller number than usual owing to the financial depression, the average for the previous five years being thirty-two. These students come in differing proportions from all parts of the Empire. For example, 18 to 19 per cent, come from India and 3 per cent, from South Africa. The majority are from the Colonial Empire.84. In the second place, there are refresher courses for serving forest officers nominated by their governments. A wide range of subjects is available from which the officer makes a selection.(ii) Research85. On the foundation of the Institute, the School of Forestry at Oxford discontinued research work, which is now concentrated in the Institute. The research work embraces sylviculture (including forest management), the physiology of trees (suspended at the moment owing to lack of funds), forest economics, pathology, wood structure, entomology, and forest botany.(iii) Information service86. The information service of the Institute consists mainly in the publication of (i) forest memoirs, (ii) a series of manuals (of which two so far have been published), and (iii) a survey of the forest trees and timbers of the Empire. In addition, the Institute are anxious to undertake the work of issuing abstracts of forestry literature. Arrangements are well advanced for it to co-operate with other countries in this work on an international basis. The information service of the Institute is available to non-contributory as well as to contributory governments.
(d) The finances of the Institute87. The main sources of the normal income of the Institute consist in (i) subscriptions received through the Colonial Office from the various Colonial Governments, and (ii) subscriptions from the Forestry Commission. In addition, each year the Institute receives further sums from the Forestry Commission and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research in respect of particular pieces of work done for them on an agency basis (e.g. for specific work under-taken on behalf of the Forest Products Research Laboratory at Princes Risborough). Owing to the financial difficulties of the Institute, the Empire Marketing Board gave grants for three years from 1930 in the hope that by the end of that period the Dominions might have agreed to subscribe regularly to the Institute, as recom-mended by the Empire Forestry Conference of 1928. These hopes have not materialised and the subscriptions received from the Dominions remain extremely small ( 783 in 1931 and  750 in 1932). The accounts are audited by the Oxford University auditors and are printed in the University Gazette.88. The Institute shares the buildings of the Oxford University School of Forestry. Its only physical assets are two houses, bought at the outset out of current revenue, a building fund of  25,000 presented by the Rajah of Sarawak, and a certain amount of books and apparatus.89. No fees are charged to students nominated by parts of the Empire that subscribe to the Institute, which are entitled to send as many students as they like irrespective of the amount of their subscription. Students sent from parts of the Empire that do not subscribe are charged an inclusive fee of  75 per annum, which, however, does not include overhead charges.(e) Possible means of increasing the usefulness of the Institute to the several parts of the Empire(i) Changes desired by the Institute90. The only change in constitution or management of th*e Institute that the Board of Management themselves desire is a re-definition of the relations of the Institute to the University of Oxford. At present, the Institute is situated in a University institution, but is not definitely part of the University. This arrangement is not satisfactory, and negotiations are in progress for the incorporation of the Institute in the University. This, the Board of Management believe, will strengthen the Institute by regularising its position.
(ii) The representation of the Dominions on the Board of Management91. It has always been contemplated that Dominions which subscribe substantially to the Institute should be represented on the Board of Management. It was not thought possible to give representation to Dominions that only subscribe small sums.(iii) Contacts of the Institute with, and relation to, institutions in otherparts of the Empire92. The Director stated that he was in close personal touch with the Institute at Dehra Dun ; he was also in contact with the forestry laboratories in Canada and elsewhere. In answer to questions, he agreed that a good training in tropical and sub-tropical forestry could be obtained at Dehra Dun. He thought it was important, however, that, in addition to the training there provided, forest officers should spend some time in Europe studying European methods of forest conservation. He therefore considered that Great Britain was the most suitable centre for an Empire forestry institute. If the Institute were to remain in Great Britain, Oxford, was, in his view, a suitable centre, as it had a flourishing School of Forestry, scientific laboratories and library facilities available at the minimum cost.VI. THE STANDING COMMITTEE ON EMPIRE FORESTRY (a) The origin and composition of the Committee(i) The origin of the Committee93. The Committee owes its origin to a resolution passed by the second Empire Forestry Conference, held in Canada in 1923. It was intended that it should serve as a link between, and prepare the agenda for, Empire Forestry Conferences. The third of these conferences was held in 1928 in Australia and New Zealand, and the fourth was due to have been held in South Africa this year, but was postponed on the suggestion of the Standing Committee owing to the economic situation.94. The conferences deal with the scientific, technical, and economic aspects of the production and disposal of timber. Delegates to them are appointed by their several governments, usually from the staffs of the forestry departments.(ii) The composition of the Committee95. The original composition of the Committee was laid down at the conference when it was constituted. It consists of one repre-sentative each of the United Kingdom, of the Dominion in which the
last conference was held, of the Dominion in which the next con-ference is to be held; together with representatives of India, the Colonies, and the Empire Forestry Association (an unofficial body representative of all parts of the Empire), and two technicians.96. The Committee meets at irregular intervals, meetings being most frequent just before the holding of conferences. There have been thirteen meetings since 1926.(b) The financial basis of the Cornmittee and of the Empire Forestry Conference97. The expenses of the Standing Committee itself are practically nil (a little on account of postage, stationery, etc.). The main expenditure of the Empire Forestry Conference consists in the publication of a bulky document of proceedings (including Empire, forestry statistics). This and other incidental expenditure incurred at the conferences have hitherto been defrayed by the government of the part of the Empire in which the conference has been held.(c) The work of the Committee98. The Standing Committee are of opinion that their constitution embraces all aspects of Empire forestry, and that their work does not overlap with that of any other authority. They also feel that they have been successful in carrying out the functions allotted to them. No new planning body for Empire forestry is, in their view, required. The functions of the Committee are threefold.(i) Work in connection with the preceding Empire Forestry Conference99. The first function of the Committee is to follow up the resolu-tions passed at the last Empire Forestry Conference. On technical matters, they correspond direct with the forest authorities in the several parts of the Empire. On financial questions, they correspond through the appropriate United Kingdom Department (e.g., the Dominions Office, the Colonial Office, etc.). Through these channels also passes correspondence dealing with such questions as the recommendations prepared by the last conference for increased Dominion and Colonial subscriptions to the Imperial Forestry Institute. On this particular question, in spite of the Committee&apos;s efforts, the resolutions of the conference came to nothing owing (at least in part) to the financial depression.(ii) Work in connection with the next Empire Forestry Conference100. The second function of the Committee is to prepare the agenda for the next Empire Forestry Conference. On this, the Committee first discuss possible subjects and then obtain the views of the forestry departments in the Dominions and Colonies.  When
these views are received, the matter is further discussed with the Dominion in which the next conference is to be held. After this discussion, the Committee finally draw up the agenda which they then recommend to the various participating governments.101. Further, the Committee lay down the lines on which the statistics of the forest resources of the various parts of the Empire should be prepared by the various governments concerned for submission to, the next conference. They follow this up by corres-pondence on points of detail with the appropriate forest authorities. In this way, when the conference meets, statistics are available in a comparable form for all parts of the Empire.(iii) Other functions102. The Committee are occasionally consulted on other questions of Empire interest. For example, they were recently asked to consider whether any changes were desirable in the constitution of the managing body of the Imperial Forestry Institute.(d) Possible changes in the constitution of the Committee or the scopeof its work103. The Committee are anxious that their numbers should not be substantially enlarged, and for this reason they hold that it would not be feasible to arrange for each of the Dominions to be represented on the Committee. They agree, however, that if the scope of their work were enlarged, it would be necessary that all the Dominions should be represented directly.VH.   THE IMPERIAL INSTITUTE (a) The origin and early history of the Institute104. The Imperial Institute was founded as an Imperial memorial of the Diamond Jubilee of Her Majesty Queen Victoria in 1887, to promote the commercial, industrial, and educational interests of the British Empire. A Royal Charter was granted for the purpose in 1888 and funds amounting to  429,000 were collected by means of subscriptions from Empire governments and private individuals for the establishment of the Institute. Of this amount,  140,000 was set aside as an Endowment Fund, and the remainder spent on the erection of the existing building. Owing to a debt of  55,000 incurred on the building, the Institute soon found itself in financial difficulties, and in 1899, the building was taken over by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom in return for (1) the liquidation of the Instituted debt of  55,000, (2) a lease of part of the building for 987 years without rent, and (3) the acceptance of liability for rates and external repairs.
105. In 1902, the control of the Institute was transferred from the then existing Governing Body to the United Kingdom Board of Trade. In 1907, an arrangement was made by which the manage-ment of the Institute was transferred to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, subject to the responsibility of the Board under the Act of 1902. In 1916, this arrangement was regularised by a further Act which formally transferred the Institute from the control of the Board to that of the Secretary of State. The position of the Institute was further considered by Parliament in 1925, when the Act by which it is at present governed was passed. This Act laid down a new system of management and transferred to the Institute as its Mineral Resources Department the Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau founded in 1917, the charter of which was thereby revoked.(b) The management of the Institute106. The Act of 1925 constituted two bodies viz. : the Imperial Institute Trustees and a Board of Governors.(i) The Imperial Institute Trustees107. The Trustees hold the Imperial Institute building, the Endowment Fund, and other property, and pay over the income of the fund to the &quot;Responsible Minister &quot; under the Act, -who is the Minister in charge of the United Kingdom Department of Overseas Trade. The management of the building is also in the hands of the &quot; Responsible Minister.&quot; The Trustees consist of the following United Kingdom Ministers, ex officio, viz., the Lord President of the Council, the First Commissioner of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury, the Secretary of State for India, the President of the Board of Trade, and the Secretary of the Department of Overseas Trade, and three other persons having special qualifications appointed by the &quot; Responsible Minister &quot;.(ii) The Board of Governors10S. The constitution of the Board of Governors is prescribed in the second schedule of the Act of 1925. The &quot; Responsible Minister &quot; is the Chairman, and the members include one representative of each of the Dominions and India (in practice the High Commissioners), nine representatives of United Kingdom Government Departments, and not more than ten representatives of scientific and commercial interests, appointed by the &quot; Responsible Minister.&quot; The Governors meet normally three or four times a year, consider important questions such as the annual budget, and receive reports from the two advisory councils of the Institute referred to in paragraph 120 below.
(iii) i he Managing Committee109. For the discharge of certain of their functions, the Board of Governors have appointed a Managing Committee of which the Comptroller-General of the Department of Overseas Trade is Chairman. The committee includes representatives of the United Kingdom Treasury, the Colonial Office, the Crown Agents for the Colonies, and one High Commissioner (at present the High Commissioner for New Zealand).110. This committee usually meets once a quarter. The programme of work of the Institute changes very little from year to year, and the details are determined by the Director. The agenda for the committee, whose main function is the superintendence of the management of the Institute, is prepared by the Comptroller-General of the Department of Overseas Trade, who for this purpose consults the Director. Papers relating to the work of the Institute are circulated to the committee from time to time.(c) The financial position of the Institute(i) Income111. The income of the Institute consists of : (i) subscriptions from His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the United Kingdom and in the Dominions and from the govern-ments of the Colonies. These consist at present of  10,000 from His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, who also defray the cost of the maintenance of the fabric of the Institute ( 2,787 per annum) and rates, etc. ( 2,457 per annum),  2,000 from Canada,  464 from Newfoundland, and  1,200 from South Africa. The Dominion contributions thus total  3,664. The anticipated subscriptions for the coming year from the Colonies and Protectorates amount to  7,262. In a few cases, portions of these subscriptions are earmarked for the Exhibition Galleries;(ii) the interest on the Endowment Fund (about  5,000 per annum) ;(iii) miscellaneous receipts, including fees, the letting of rooms, sale of publications and refunds. These amount to about  2,900 per annum;(iv) the annuity in respect of the North Gallery of  864, terminable in 1941 ;(v) a contribution from Sir Benjamin Drage of  6,856 per annum.   This will cease after 1937.112. It will be seen that of the above the only certain item of permanent income is the interest on the Endowment Fund ( 5,000). The Institute has received from the Empire Marketing Board
(a) a capital grant to equip the cinema and an annual grant for its maintenance and (b) two or three special grants to enable particular scientific memoirs to be published.(ii) Expenditure113. All possible economies have been made in the expenditure of the Institute short of entirely recasting the work on a &apos;more modest scale. By far the most important item of expenditure (about 90 per cent, of the whole) consists of the salaries and wages of the scientific and subordinate staff engaged in the investigation and intelligence services of the Institute. If the Exhibition Galleries were closed, there would, we were informed, be a net saving of  3,000 per annum, together with any rental obtainable for the accommodation.114. In the current year, it is anticipated that expenditure will exceed income by  4,359. This deficit will be met by withdrawing an equivalent sum from the Reserve Fund, which at present amounts to  18,000 and has been mainly fed in the past by private benefactions (the Cowdray Gift of  26,000, and the Wakefield Gift of  25,000).115. In past years, the management of the Institute has endeavoured out of its own income to make some small contribution to the Reserve Fund to meet the recurrent expenditure of redecorating the interior of the Institute.116. If the present rate of subscription is continued for the next few years by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Dominions, and the Colonial governments, and if the expenditure of the Institute remains at its present level, the Reserve Fund of the Institute will have been completely exhausted by the end of 1937, when if no further financial basis has been devised the Institute will have to be either completely remodelled or closed down.(iii) The future of the Imperial Institute building117. Under the scheme of re-organisation adopted in 1899 (see paragraph 104 above) half of the Imperial Institute building, together with the Central Hall, was let to the University of London. The new accommodation of the University in Bloomsbury will be ready in the course of a few years, when they will vacate the part of the Imperial Institute building which they now occupy.(d) The functions of the Institute and the internal organisation of the Institute for their discharge118. The functions of the Institute are defined in the first schedule of the Act of 1925. They fall into two main groups, viz., (a) intelligence and investigations and (b) the Exhibition Galleries. -
(i) The intelligence and investigations work119. The technical work of the Institute, which deals with the determination of the quality and the uses of Empire raw materials, with their preliminary testing, and with advising upon the production of those for which a market is available, is carried out by two main departments of the Institute, viz., the Plant and Animal Products Department, and the Mineral Resources Department. In recent years, in spite of financial difficulties, there has been a steady increase both in investigations conducted and inquiries answered in regard alike to the Plant and Animal Products Department and the Mineral Resources Department.120. Each of these departments is assisted by a scientific advisory council, attached to each of which are a number of technical advisory committees. The chairmen of the technical advisory committees are all members of their respective advisory councils. The advisory councils include also High Commissioners of the Dominions and India or their representatives, and members nominated by the Colonial Office. Normally, the Dominions are not represented on the technical advisory committees, but the Director of the Institute is always willing to arrange for such representation if a particular Dominion so desires.121. Each of the two main divisions is divided into an intelligence section, and an investigation section. The intelligence sections are responsible for the collection and dissemination of information of a technical and commercial character regarding raw materials of the Empire. The work of dissemination is mainly carried out through the Instituted Bulletin, which comprises important original papers on matters regarding the Instituted work, together with a very valuable bibliography of current literature. On the plant and animal side also individual memoirs are published by the Institute. On the mineral resources side, the dissemination of information is mainly effected through the Instituted survey of the mineral position of the Empire. Perhaps the most valuable publication in this field is the annual statistical summary of the mineral industries of the world. The various publications of the Institute are distributed free to the Dominions and Colonies whether their governments subscribe to the maintenance of the Institute or not. Receipts from sales amount to about  240. The investigation work of the Institute is carried on by the scientific staff of the Instituted laboratories. This work includes all testing up to, but not including, fundamental research. When the latter is required, arrangements are made for it to he conducted by some appropriate existing institution. The inquiries received by the Institute consist of (a) inquiries from Dominion and Colonial governments, and (6) inquiries from trade associations and private individuals. Work is conducted free of charge for the former, but trade associations and private individuals are charged an ordinary commercial fee.
122. The subjects on which important work has been conducted &apos; by the Institute, and of which the Institute has special knowledge and experience include fibres, sericulture, oils and oil seeds, essential oils and resins, hides and skins, tanning materials, paper, minerals, concrete, etc. The importance of these commodities to the several parts of the Empire differs greatly. The greatest value is derived by the Colonial Empire, while some of the Dominions benefit very little from the investigations side of the Institute^ work.123. Every effort is made by the Institute to avoid overlapping in function with other bodies, and when new bodies are brought into existence, specially equipped to carry out some part of the work hitherto done by the Institute, it makes arrangements for handing over the work to the new organisation. An example of this is to be found in timber. Up to the foundation in 1922 of the Forest Products Research Laboratory at Princes Risborough, the Institute tested Empire timbers, as well as minor forest products. Directly the laboratory was able to take over the testing of Empire timbers, the Institute stopped this part of its work.124. When requests for investigations are received from a govern-ment department in a Dominion, steps are taken by the Institute to ascertain from the High Commissioner concerned whether his government desire the work to be undertaken and are satisfied that it can be done more suitably at the Institute than in the Dominion. It often happens that in such cases, the chief value of the test being conducted at the Institute lies in the fact that the Dominion producer is thus furnished with an independent and corroborative test of the value of his product. This is often of great value in pushing its sale in the United Kingdom market.(ii) The Exhibition Galleries125. At the time of the last re-organisation of the Institute in 1925, the Exhibition Galleries were in need of thorough re-organisa-tion. Since that date, all the Exhibition Courts (except two) have been re-arranged, dioramas added, and special exhibits renewed. This has been made possible by means of special ad hoc grants made by most of the governments of the Dominions and by India and by the governments of the Colonies during the last six years. These grants amount in the aggregate to  21,000 in addition to the sub-prescriptions received from the Dominions and Colonies for the general maintenance of the Institute during that period.126. During the same period, there has been a very marked increase in the number of visitors to the galleries, who last year exceeded one million. The usefulness of the galleries is greatly enhanced by the guide lecturers and their educative value is well recognised by educational authorities in the United Kingdom. The greater part of the visitors consist of school children.   Many of these
come in organised parties from their schools. The majority naturally come from London or Greater London, but many parties have come from distant parts of the United Kingdom.127. In the opinion of the Director, the galleries serve an invaluable educative function and are fundamental to the Institute. The number of persons in the United Kingdom who can travel in the Dominions is very limited, but by means of the gaUeries many hundreds of thousands are now given an opportunity of learning something of the Empire and its products. In his opinion, this increased knowledge of the Empire is of the greatest value.(iii) Other departments of the Institute128. The other departments of the Institute include a small statistical department, the library, the secretariat, and the central registry, all of which are housed in the Imperial Institute building.VIII. THE OVERSEA MECHANICAL TRANSPORT COUNCIL (a) The origin and constitution ol the Council129. For some years prior to the cstabhshment of the Council, the Empire Cotton Growing Corporation conducted experiments in regard to the use of mechanical transport in undeveloped terri-tories where the construction of a branch railway would not be economically justified. After a time it became clear to the Cor-poration that more extensive experiments were required, and after discussions with the Colonial Office, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom appointed a sub-committee of the (United Kingdom) Committee of Civil Research to examine the whole question. That committee prepared a report recommending a five-year scheme of investigation, which was in essentials accepted, and the Oversea Mechanical Transport Council was brought into existence.130. The members of the Council consist of persons, directly appointed by those of the Dominions that participate in the scheme, and of representatives of India, of the Colonial Empire and of the Empire Marketing Board. The Council meets about four times a year. Its function is to maintain connection between the Directing Committee referred to in the following paragraph and the various subscribing governments.131. The main responsibility for the mechanical transport in-vestigations rests with the Directing Committee. This is a technical committee of five persons, appointed not by the Council itself but by the Secretary of State for the Colonies at the same time as the Council itself was constituted. (At that time the Secretary of State for the Colonies performed the duties now discharged by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.)
132. The Directing Committee meets frequently, but at irregular&apos; intervals, when questions arise for decision. The staff consists of a technical assistant and a secretary. Both are in the direct employment of the Committee, and neither is a Civil Servant of the United Kingdom.(b) The financial basis of the Council133. Under the scheme of work which the Council was set up to carry out it was contemplated that the Empire Marketing Board would subscribe   for   against contributions received from overseas. Certain of the Dominions, India, and a number of the Colonies agreed to contribute on this basis. In some cases, they have not found it possible to continue in later years subscriptions at the rate originally agreed upon. Since work was started at the end of 1928, approximately  35,000 has been expended. Of this total, the main items up to the present have been the design and manufacture of the first 15-ton unit ( 10,000), the design and manufacture to date of the second 15-ton unit ( 852), the original design for a tracked unit (not adopted) ( 2,800), the testing of vehicles ( 6,500), the purchase and testing of minor vehicles and parts ( 2,500), salaries, etc. ( 8,000), office expenses ( 2,500), and the . publication of a bulletin ( 1,500).134. The Council estimate that. their work would be finished. with the construction and testing of a 30-ton unit, which could be carried out in a period of 1\ years at a cost of  32,000. Towards this, they have at present a sum unspent, received by way of subscriptions, amounting to  5,000. If the Empire Marketing Board grant disappeared, the finances of the scheme would collapse, unless increased governmental subscriptions were received. In view of the important results already obtained, the Council would regard such a contingency as most regrettable.135. The Council contemplate that their work and that of the Directing Committee is of an ad hoc character, and that both bodies will disappear simultaneously when the testing of the 30-ton unit has been completed.(c) The work of the Council136. The Council abandoned at an early stage their first idea of the development of a tracked unit. Their main outlay has been on the design a.nd manufacture, in close consultation with motor manu-facturers in the United Kingdom, of a 15-ton unit. Satisfactory arrangements have been made to preserve for the contributing governments any patent rights acquired in respect of novel features in the design of the units constructed. The first of these is now being finally tried out in the Gold Coast, after having passed success-fully through a 5,000-mile cross country trial in the United Kingdom.
The Council attach great importance to being permitted to manu-facture one 30-ton unit. Xne history of the six-wheel vehicle now widely used for commercial purposes shows that strong pressure from the War Office was necessary to induce motor manufacturers to make, even this vehicle, though it has since proved of great com-mercial importance. The same consideration applies even more forcibly to the construction of the 15-ton and 30-ton units, which, it should be remembered, incorporate in their design several novel features, e.g., a 250 b.h.p. compression ignition engine. The Council are satisfied that these units would never be made if governments of the Empire did not pay for the initial cost of design and manu-facture of an experimental unit. It is believed that these vehicles will prove of very great value in the less developed parts of the Empire, but it is probable that on account of the kind of country in which they operate, there will never be a very large demand for them. The Council are satisfied that for such purposes the first 15-ton unit represents a great advance on any previous type of vehicle, and that it is capable of operating at. 5d. per ton-mile without return load. It is estimated that with the 30-ton unit this cost could be reduced to 3Jd. per ton-mile. If these vehicles were manufactured in commercial quantities, the 15-ton unit would cost about  2,000 and the 30-ton unit about  3,000.IX. THE EMPIRE TIMBERS COMMITTEE (a) The origin and constitution of the Committee137. The Empire Timbers Committee owes its origin to a suggestion by the Imperial Economic Committee that arrangements should be made for testing Empire timbers. It was appointed by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and includes representatives of the Dominions, a number of technicians, together with trade representatives. The Dominion representatives are nominated by their respective governments.(b) The functions of the Committee138. The functions of the Committee are divided into (a) investigations of Empire timbers, and(b) advisory work in connection with the marketing of Empire timbers.(i) Its investigation work139. On the investigation side the main function of the Committee is to decide questions of priority as between the various applications received. This is an important part of the work, as there is always a considerable waiting list of timbers for testing. If further funds were available, this list could be reduced to some extent, but it is important to remember that the market cannot
absorb more than a certain number of new timbers at any given time. The applications considered by the Committee come either from the governments of the Dominions, or from those of the Colonies.140. In the case of new timbers received from the Colonies, a preliminary test is first made, and further investigations are then carried out if the results are promising. As regards timbers from the Dominions, the tests are usually either (a) confirmatory tests, or (b) specialised tests. Confirmatory tests, to check those carried out in the Dominion of origin, have often proved most helpful in extending markets in the United Kingdom. Specialised tests are tests designed to ascertain the value of a given timber for some special purpose. A complete test of a new timber costs between  400 and  500 and requires between 2,000 and 2,500 cubic feet of timber.141. The Committee works in close co-operation with organisations both in the United Kingdom and in the Dominions. As regards the latter, the Princes Risborough laboratory corresponds direct with the Dominion authorities in regard to proposals for testing Dominion timbers to prevent overlapping of work in the United Kingdom and the Dominion concerned.142. The work of the laboratory is closely associated with that of the Imperial Institute, but there need be no overlapping between the two organisations if, under the arrangements made, the Imperial Institute confines itself to testing minor forest products, and the Empire Timbers Committee to the testing of timbers. Actually at the momeht there is some overlapping, as the Imperial Institute has a Timber Advisory Committee which covers part of the same field as the Empire Timbers Committee. Arrangements have, however, been made to dissolve this committee and prevent over-lapping in future, but these, we understand, are held up pending the receipt of our report.(ii) Its advisory work, 143. The Committee renders assistance in establishing markets for new timbers which the laboratory has proved to be suitable for use in the United Kingdom and in extending the use of Empire timbers for which limited markets already exist there.144. Attached to the laboratory there is a timber utilisation officer, who has proved most valuable in putting the results of the scientific tests into a form readily understood by prospective buyers and by putting suppliers in touch with buyers.(c) The financial basis of the Committee145. The laboratory at Princes Risborough was founded in 1922 (though it did not operate fully until 1925) as a United Kingdom institution for the testing of timbers.   Its functions have always
included the testing of all well-established timbers whether of Empire or foreign origin. No fees are charged toEmpire. govern-ments, but fees are charged to individual firms for reports on timbers submitted by them. The laboratory receives fees from the Office of Works, the London County Council, etc., for advising on timbers and in this way is often able to push the use of well-established Empire timbers.146. The Empire Timbers Committee was brought into existence in 1929, when the Empire Marketing Board provided a capital grant of  30,000 for increased accommodation, etc., at the laboratory and an annual payment varying in different years from  5,000 to  7,000 to cover the expenditure incurred on the special investigations of new timbers of Empire origin. The work on new Empire timbers, i.e., the work carried out for the Empire Timbers Committee, represents about 20 per cent, of the total work of the laboratory.X. THE IMPERIAL SHIPPING COMMITTEE (a) The origin and constitution of the Committee147. This Committee, which inquires into, and reports on, matters connected with the development of sea communications between the different parts of the Empire, owes its origin to a resolution passed by the Imperial War Conference of 1918. Its membership consists of three groups in addition to the Chairman, viz. : :(i) Representatives of the governments of the Empire, The representatives of the Dominions are in most cases (this was less so at the outset of the Committee &apos;s work) their High Commissioners. When the High Commissioners cannot attend, they appoint a substitute from their office. Continuity is secured by the High Commissioner in nearly all cases deputing the same officer to serve for him.(ii) Persons experienced in shipping and commerce.-Th.e second group consists of five members who are directed to be persons &quot; experienced in shipping and commerce.&quot; Two representatives are shipowners, one is a ship builder, one a merchant, and one of the others, in practice, an industrialist. These form ah extremely important element in ,the composition of the Committee. In the case of the shipowners, representative bodies are asked to suggest names when a vacancy arises. The appointment, when settled, is formally notified to the Chairman of the Imperial Shipping Committee by the Prime Minister of, the. United Kingdom. A substantially similar course is followed when vacancies arise in respect of the three other seats in this group. The Dominions do not appear to have been consulted in the past in regard to appointments to either section of this group of the Committee.
At times it happens that one or other of the shipowner, members of the Committee are directly concerned financially in some matter referred to the Committee. In that case, their place is taken temporarily by one of the shipowners from the panel of six which was constituted for the purpose under a resolution of the Imperial Conference of 1930 and in the appoint-ment of which the Dominions were consulted.There have been a number of changes in the personnel of this group owing to resignations for business reasons, but a sufficient measure of continuity&apos; of experience has been secured.(iii) The representative of civil aviation. The Imperial Con-ference of 1930 realised that the competition of civil air transport might prove an important factor in the future development of Imperial1, shipping. The terms of reference of the Committee were extended by the Conference to &quot; take into account facilities for air transport &quot; on Imperial ocean routes and a representative, of civil aviation was added to the Committee.148. The frequency of the meetings of the Committee varies, greatly. At times in the past the Committee met regularly once a week for many months at a time. At the present time it meets less frequently. Even when the Committee itself is not sitting,, small sub-committees are often holding meetings, and in addition,, a considerable volume of work is discharged by the Chairman.149. The sub-committees are of an ad hoc character to consider particular subjects. Their members are generally drawn from the members of the Imperial Shipping Committee,- but on occasions, outside persons have been invited to serve on them. In addition, the Committee itself at times sits with assessors. , For example, the Admiralty have rendered great assistance by allowing surveying experts of their service to sit as assessors when the Committee has been considering technical questions in relation to particular harbours (e.g., when they were considering a question in connection with the harbour at Hong Kong, where the Admiralty, having an important naval establishment there, were able to tender very valuable advice).150. The secretary of the Committee is an United Kingdom official lent from the Mercantile Marine Department of the Board of Trade. A proportion of his salary is included in the estimates of the Committee.151. The total annual expenses of the Committee are about  2,000, the whole of which is defrayed by the United Kingdom. In one case only has the Committee received a payment in respect of a particular investigation. This was when on the request of the Canadian Government they appointed a sub-committee to proceed to Canada to settle a. dispute. On that occasion, all the expenses, were defrayed by the Government of that Dominion.
(b) The functions of the Committee152. At the time when the Committee was appointed, it was contemplated that it would undertake a survey of the facilities for marine transport on the routes necessary for Empire trade. Such a survey, if undertaken on the initiative of the Committee, might have caused misunderstandings with (say) harbour authorities on the different routes, and the Committee early reached the con-clusion that their best course would be to discharge this part of their duties by confining themselves to the consideration of particular routes and questions specifically referred to them from some part of the Empire. In addition,&apos; a general survey would have entailed the appointment of a large and expensive staff.153. The questions considered by the Committee are referred to them either by a Dominion or Colonial government or by private bodies such as chambers of shipping. Most of the questions come from governments, but some very important matters have been raised by non-official bodies.154. In the case of every application the Committee first consider carefully whether or not it comes within their terms of reference. The only occasion when they would unhesitatingly undertake an inquiry without deciding this question would be when they received a request to do so from all the governments of the Empire, as they would regard such a request as constituting an ad hoc extension of their terms of reference.155. Copies of every report prepared by the Committee are transmitted by the Chairman direct to each government of the Commonwealth. Where it is desired that the report should be published, the prior consent of all the governments of the Common-wealth is obtained. When reports are published they are published as United Kingdom Command Papers. The Committee would prefer to be able to publish their own reports.156. The Committee have no desire to be given power to take evidence on oath or to caU for the production of papers. The publicity given to their reports by the governments gives them sufficient authority and they feel no need for the grant to them of additional powers.157. Apart from the possibility of altering their financial basis the Committee are not conscious at the present time of any need for change in their composition or procedure or any extension of their terms of reference. The latter have been widened from time to time since the Committee was appointed in 1918, and the Com-mittee feel that if later experience points to the need for extension, the best course would be for the Committee to seek the approval of the governments of the Empire for the change desired either then or at the next Imperial Conference.
XI.-THE IMPERIAL COMMUNICATIONS ADVISORY COMMITTEE (a) The origin and constitution of the Committee158. The Committee owes it origin to a recommendation- by the Imperial Wireless and Cables Conference, 1928, that a committee should be constituted to serve as a link for certain purposes between the Communications Company then proposed (i.e. the Imperial and International Communications, Ltd.) and the various governments of the Empire. The members of the Committee are appointed by the several governments of the Empire for an indefinite period. There have been a certain number of changes in the Committee&apos;s composition, but these have not been sufficient to interfere with the continuity of the Committee&apos;s work. In the three and a half years that the Committee has been in existence, 110 meetings, including those of sub-committees, have been held.T59. The total expenditure of the Committee, including honoraria to members, the salary of the secretary, office expenditure, printing, etc., amounts to approximately  7,400. The whole of this is provided by a grant from Imperial and International Communications, Ltd., in accordance with an agreement entered into between the Company and the United Kingdom Treasury on behalf of the various partici-pating governments. This payment is treated as part of the working expenses of the Company. As the main object of the Committee is to protect the interests of telegraph and cable users, it was thought reasonable at the time that the Committee was constituted that the funds required for the Committee should be provided by the Com-munications Company rather than by contributions from the various governments represented on the Committee or, in other -words, from the taxpayer.(b) The functions! of the Committee160. The functions of the Committee are partly advisory and partly executive in character.161. In the first place, the Imperial and International Communi-cations, Ltd. are under an obligation to obtain the consent of the Committee for : (i) the sale or disposal of any of the Company&apos;s assets ;(ii) parting with control of foreign corporations ;(iii) any increase of rates ;(iv) withdrawal of any category of message ;(v) discontinuance of services ;(vi) borrowing amounts of more than  500,000 or at a ratemore than 1 per cent, above bank rate ;(vii) the issue of new share capital;(viii) the disposal of 50 per cent, of the revenue of Imperial and international Communications, Ltd. &apos; in excess of  1,865,000.
162. In the second place, the Company are under an obligation to consult the Committee on any scheme for extending or restricting operations (in regard to general policy but not business and manage-ment) and in particular on proposals for new routes, for varying rates, or for altering arrangements for the distribution of traffic.163. The Company are also under an obligation to comply with any strategical directions that they may receive from the Committee on behalf of any of the governments of the Empire, subject to the condition that the Company are entitled to be reimbursed to the extent that they can show that they are out of pocket by reason of complying with such strategical directions.164. It will be seen from the above that the Committee are advisory on all questions other than those on which their actual consent is required. With regard to the latter questions, the Committee take executive action by communicating their decisions direct to the Company. The most important decisions falling into this class are those which have been taken by the Committee in regard to telegraph rates.165. The bulk of the questions considered by the Committee have been referred to them by the Company. A certain number have also been referred to them by Empire governments. In addition, the Committee have taken up questions at the instance of non-govern-mental bodies.166. The various governments of the Empire are kept informed of the work of the Committee through their representatives on it, and also by the circulation of documents to the members of the Committee for transmission to the appropriate department of their governments. In addition, the Committee, with the prior consent of the governments concerned, issue periodical reports on their work. Of these, three so far have appeared.167. The Committee consider that their organisation is appropriate for the purposes intended to be covered by the recommendations of the Cable Conference of 1928.. The members of the Committee have always been able to reach unanimity in regard to questions submitted to them, and they have throughout maintained friendly relations with the Company.XII. THE IMPERIAL ECONOMIC COMMITTEE (a) The origin and functions of the Conrmittee(i) The origin of the Committee168. The project for an Imperial Economic Committee was first advanced at the Imperial Economic Conference of 1923. The Committee was actually brought into being in March, 1925.   Its
terms of reference which were originally restricted in character and practically confined to marketing inquiries in respect of oversea produce in the United Kingdom, have been gradually extended by subsequent decisions of Imperial Conferences.(ii) The functions of the Committee169. The Committee, which is purely advisory in character, is at present working on instructions received from the Imperial Conference of 1930.   These fall into three groups.(1) Marketing inquiries170. These inquiries relate partly to foodstuffs and partly to raw &quot;materials. By July, 1932, the Committee had issued reports on thirteen food commodities involving such important products as meat, fruit, and dairy produce. Some of these are now six or seven years old, and it is felt that it would be advantageous if they could be brought up to date or more generally if the Committee were given facilities for watching developments in.regard to commodities already examined. In that event it could at any time furnish any government of the Empire with an up-to-date statement of the trade position in regard to that commodity.171. The Imperial Conference of 1930 referred a list of raw materials to the Committee for examination and report. Reports have now been issued on three of these, and an inquiry is in progress on a fourth.     .(2) Industrial matters172. The activities of the Committee under this head mainly take the form of trade surveys. These are intended to contain the main facts regarding production and consumption in the Empire and foreign countries, the most important import and export figures, a statement of the competitive situation and of the progress made within the Empire in production and export as compared with the progress made in foreign countries. Two trade surveys have so far been prepared, namely, those on agricultural machinery and rubber goods.(3) Items remitted by the Imperial Conference, 1930173. The items remitted by the Imperial Conference of 1930 on the recommendation of its General Economic Committee, consisted of (1) the arrangement on a common plan for existing information on the mineral resources of the Empire, (2) an inquiry into the possibility of a common understanding with regard to the principles which should determine the distinction between Empire and non-Empire goods. Of these, the first item is now under investigation by the Committee and the second has formed the subject of a special report by the Committee.
174. Within the general scope of the functions described above, the Committee is itself the judge of how, and in what order&apos; to approach the various matters referred1 to it. for consideration. Occasionally the Committee has been informed that a particular Empire government is anxious that the examination of a particular product should be expedited.   This is then done if possible.(b) The constitution of the Committee175. When the Committee was first constituted, each of the Dominions, India, and the Colonial Empire were allotted two seats, Southern Rhodesia, one seat, and the United Kingdom four seats. By an arrangement made shortly afterwards an additional member, not representing any government of the Empire, but agreed to by all, was appointed to act as Chairman. -176, In 1930 the constitution of the Committee was slightly altered, the United Kingdom representation being reduced to.two seats, and the arrangement by which the Chairman was an additional member being changed. Thereafter, the Committee itself was directed to elect its Chairman from among its own members.177. The members of the Committee are appointed by their respective governments, and though from-time to time there have been changes, a substantial continuity in personnel has been secured.(c) The work of the Committee178. At the beginning, and for the first two or three years, the Committee did all its work in full meetings of the committee. Later, it devised a procedure by which, after a preliminary discussion of a particular subject, it would be referred to an ad hoc sub-committee composed, as to the greater part, of members of the Committee itself, but, in part, of outside persons having a special experience of the subject to be investigated. The reports of these sub-committees are considered by the full Committee, and, subject to such amend-ment or expansion as may be thought desirable, are adopted by the Committee as one of its own reports.179. The Committee&apos;s reports are addressed to each of the governments of the Empire. At the time of their submission they are confidential, but steps are taken to ascertain whether the various governments concur in publication, and, if they do, the reports are published. Where any Empire government demurs to publication, the report is withheld from the public.180. The Committee&apos;s reports are often of a two-fold nature. In the first place, they contain information of value to traders in particular commodities under investigation, with suggestions in some cases, to the trade for improvements in marketing methods.
In the second place, they often contain recommendations to Empire governments, the adoption of which would in certain cases,, involve action such as legislation.181. It has always been understood by all concerned that the fact that the nominee of a government signs a particular report does not in any way commit his government to taking action on the lines recommended in the report in question.182. The Committee as such does not correspond direct with Dominion Governments, and formal communications for them and also for His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are addressed by the secretary of the Committee to the Dominions Office, by whom the necessary communication is then made to the government concerned. This arrangement, it was indicated, had been adopted as being the most convenient form of communication. In addition, the members of the Committee, many of whom are High Commissioners, freely communicate with their governments on matters relating to the work of the Committee.183. The Committee has always been able to obtain any information that it might require either from the United Kingdom government departments or from departments of Dominion Govern-ments. It is much assisted in this matter by reason of the fact that the members of the Committee are the nominees of the several governments of the Empire and have authority to draw upon the whole resources in regard to information, etc., of the government by whom they are appointed.(d) The staff and finances of the Committee184. The staff of the Committee consists of a whole-time secretary, who is also secretary to the Executive Council of the Imperial Agri-cultural Bureaux, three assistants, and the part-time services of a clerical officer. The whole of the staff are non-pensionable temporary officials. They are in no sense servants of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, being rather servants of the Committee itself.185. The annual expenditure of the Committee is about  5,000 of which slightly over one half represents salaries and wages. When the Committee was first appointed, its expenses were defrayed from the Vote of the United Kingdom Board of Trade. When in 1926 the Empire Marketing Board was constituted, an arrangement was made that the expenses of the Committee should be a first charge upon the Empire Marketing Fund.186. The Committee has always worked in close relation with the Empire Marketing Board. In a number of important instances, grants have been made by the Board on recommendations contained in reports of the Imperial Economic Committee. Thus, it was the Imperial Economic Committee that first recommended
the extension of low temperature research, the establishment of a testing station for Empire timbers at Princes Risborough,, and the publication of fruit and dairy produce intelligence notes. The border line between the duties of the Imperial Economic Com-mittee and the Empire Marketing Board in the matter of surveys of particular foodstuffs and raw materials is not clearly defined. Overlapping is, however, prevented by close consultation between the two organisations. It is true that in some cases a subject has been examined both by the Imperial Economic Committee and by a committee appointed by an individual government in the Empire. No overlapping arises in such cases as investigations of the latter type are conducted from a national, as distinct from an inter-Imperial, angle.Xm. THE EMPIRE MARKETING BOARD(a) The origin of the Board187. The origin of the Empire Marketing Board is briefly as follows. At the Imperial Economic Conference, 1923, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom undertook to grant to Empire countries increased preferences on certain articles of food then dutiable if imported from foreign countries and to grant preferences on certain other articles of food till then not dutiable. Following a General Election, the new government felt unable to carry out the undertakings given by their predecessors. Another government came into power at the end of December, 1924, which while anxious to give effect to the spirit of the 1923 resolutions, felt precluded by election pledges from imposing taxes on food of normal, general, and daily consumption. The then Prime Minister (Mr. Baldwin) proposed, in lieu, to allocate a round sum of  1 million per annum for the purpose of financing schemes for promoting the sale of Empire produce in the United Kingdom. This sum, it was estimated, represented the equivalent in terms of money of the advantages which would have been conferred on the Empire overseas if the preferential duties promised by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom at the Imperial Economic Conference of 1923 had been imposed. When in December, 1924, he made this announce-ment to the House of Commons, the Prime Minister added that the Dominions had always recognised that the home producers should have first place in the home market, but that they asked, and rightly in the Prime Ministers opinion, that they should be given preferences over foreign countries in that part of the home market which could not be supplied by the home producer.188. In 1925, the Imperial Economic Committee, then recently constituted, was asked to submit as its first report suggestions for the way in which the proposed grant of  1 million should be expended.   In its report, dated 29th July, 1925, it suggested the:
establishment of what it -called an executive. commission to be responsible for the expenditure of the grant on a publicity campaign on behalf of Empire foodstuffs, on co-ordinated schemes of scientific research and similar purposes. In the same report, the Committee expressed &quot; unanimous and emphatic agreement&quot; with the view expressed by the Prime. Minister of the United Kingdom in the House of Commons that the United Kingdom producer should have first place in the home market. The Committee added that in its view precedence should be given in the United Kingdom market for foodstuffs in the following order : Home produce ..       ..       . .       ..      First place.Dominion and Colonial produce       ..      Second place. Foreign produce . .       ..       ..      Third place.189. After consideration of the report of the Imperial Economic Committee and after communication with the Dominion Govern-ments, His MajestyV Government in the United Kingdom decided to constitute the Empire Marketing Board, and this decision was communicated to the House of Commons in March, 1926, by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, who then stated that it would be a direction to the Board that United Kingdom agricultural products should be included with imported Empire products within the scope of the Board&apos;s grant. The Board started work in May, 1926.(b) The constitution and organisation of the Board(i) The constitution of the Board190. The Board consists of twenty persons, appointed by the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs who is the Chairman. The: Vice-Chairman has been either the Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, or the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies. Of the members, five act ex officio, being Ministers or officials of the United Kingdom Government. The remainder are appointed by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs after consultation with the Chairman of the Imperial Economic Committee. These include representatives of each of the Dominions, of India, Southern Rhodesia and the Colonial Empire. At the outset, these repre-sentatives were those who were already serving in that capacity on the Imperial Economic Committee.191. In constitutional form the Board, is an advisory committee to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. The Secretary of State has, however, never acted without the advice of the Board. In practice, therefore, the functions of the Board have differed little from those of an executive body. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs is the Minister responsible to the United Kingdom Parliament for the Board, the funds of which are provided on a
separate vote (the Vote for Empire Marketing). The accounting officer is the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.192. At first, the Board met weekly. Later, it met normally once a month. In recent times, however, owing to the restrictions imposed on its finances, the Board has met less frequently. In all, sixty-four meetings have been held since May, 1926.(ii) The organisation of the Board193. The Board conducts its work through five main committees, viz., the Research Grants Committee, the Marketing Committee, the Publicity Committee, the Film Committee, and the Agricultural Economics Committee. In addition to these committees there are a number of dependent permanent committees. Except in cases of urgency, questions are not considered by the Board until they have been examined by one or other of the main committees. The chairman of each of the main committees is a member of the Board. These committees include some persons who are not members of the Board. In the case of the dependent committees often a large part of the personnel are not members of the Board.194. The main committees are appointed by the Board itself. The dependent committees are appointed by whichever is the appropriate main committee. No difficulty has been experienced in securing the voluntary unpaid services of outside persons for the Board&apos;s committees.195. Most of the committees, though dealing with particular subjects, have not themselves undertaken any continuing work. In one or two cases, however, e.g., in that of the Wool Statistics Committee, it would be desirable to arrange for some body to com-plete the work in hand in the event of the Board being brought to an end.196. In addition, there is a body constituted by the Board known as the Standing Conference of Dominion and Colonial representatives. This body, which meets monthly, consists of the appropriate officers of the offices of the High Commissioners for the several Dominions, India and Southern Rhodesia and of the publicity officers from the Agents for the various Colonies. The object of this Conference is to co-ordinate the activities of these officers and the Board in such matters as publicity, exhibitions, shopping weeks, the opening of Empire retail shops, etc.(iii) The staff of the Board197. In the case of the staff of the Board, the Treasury exercise a degree of control which they do not exercise in regard to other items of the Board&apos;s expenditure. The Board itself is not normally consulted in regard to appointments to its staff, which consists of
two classes, viz., persons temporarily engaged and members of the United Kingdom Civil Service. In the first year of their service, the United Kingdom Civil Servants had an option of returning to their own department. This has now expired, and the Civil Servants, in question are definitely assigned to the Board.(c) The functions and procedure of the Board198. The functions.of the Board at the outset were limited to-making grants designed to increase the sale of Empire produce in the United Kingdom. By an extension of its powers recommended by the Imperial Conference, 1930, the Board has, since March, 1931, had authority to set up machinery in the Dominions for increasing the sale in the Dominions of United Kingdom and Dominion produce. In fact, however, no action has been taken under these extended powers.199. The Imperial Economic Committee in their first report recommended that 65 per cent, of the proposed fund should be devoted to publicity and Only 15 per cent, to the promotion of research. The Board has, however, since its inception always-contemplated that it would spend a larger percentage of its income on the promotion of scientific research than that suggested above-Owing to the financial crisis of 1931 and the subsequent restriction of the Board&apos;s activities, expenditure on publicity has been severely curtailed, while existing research grants have been reduced and no-new ones made. Had it not been for this, the percentage of the Board&apos;s funds spent on publicity would have been greater than,, in fact, has been the case.200. The Board has always made it a practice to consult the United Kingdom Government department concerned in regard to-applications received for research grants. Wherever a research institution that desires a grant is associated with some United Kingdom Government department, the application to the Board comes through that department. Applications are only received from United Kingdom institutions direct when they are not connected with any particular department. The Board makes it a rule to consult Dominion Governments concerned in regard to all applications received from Dominions if they do not come through a Dominion Government department. There is no possibility of a. Dominion institution receiving a grant without the knowledge of the Dominion Government concerned. In the case of Dominions having federal constitutions, applications from state or provincial departments are similarly referred to the federal government.201. The Board took the view from the outset that the most satisfactory course would be for it to obtain the best scientific-advice available in regard to each application from the appropriate scientific authorities in the United Kingdom and the Dominions,.
and in the light of that advice to come to a decision itself on the merits of the application. The Board, is not conscious of any disadvantages resulting from the fact that its Research Grants Committee, by which all applications for research grants are con-sidered, is a lay, and not a scientific, body.202. In the field of research, there was a natural tendency in the early days of the Board for the greater part of its time to be taken up with the consideration of applications submitted to it from institutions in the United Kingdom and later from other parts of the Empire. As the work has developed, the Board has, however, tended to take a larger measure of initiative. Informal discussions on this subject took place in 1930, during the Imperial Conference, and arrangements were made for each part of the Empire to draw up a programme indicating what aspects of research were of special interest to it. At the time it was proposed that when replies had been received from the Dominions, India, and the Colonial Empire, the Board should draw up a general research programme based on the advice received. In fact, however, little progress has been made in this direction owing to the intervention of the financial crisis.203. In the field of research, the Board has always made it a rule to entrust the actual work to the appropriate government department or research institution when such existed either in the United Kingdom or in the Empire overseas. It has itself only founded independent research establishments if arrangements could not be made for the work in question to be undertaken at an existing institution.204. The organisation of the market intelligence, market pro-motion, and publicity sides of the Board&apos;s work differs greatly from that of the research grants work in that in the latter case the Board works through other organisations which it pays to do particular pieces of work, while in the former case the work is actually performed by officers in the direct&apos; employment of the Board. In this field the organisation adopted by the Board depends on the character of the work to be done. The various methods adopted are described in detail in sub-sections (g), (h) and (i) below.(d) The finances of the Board205. As already explained, it was originally proposed that the normal income of the Board should be  1 million per annum, and that any unexpended balance at the end of the financial year should be carried forward to the next year, and not, as in the case of all United Kingdom Government departments, surrendered to the Exchequer at the end of each financial year. As it was anticipated that the Board would not be in full operation in its first year, it was arranged that the initial grant, i.e., that for 1926, should be only  500,000.
206. In 1927, the full sum of  1 million was voted, but only  400,000 was actually issued. In the subsequent years, between 1928 and 1931, the amounts voted by the United Kingdom&apos; Parlia-ment varied between  500,000 and  600,000. - This conformed to a suggestion by the Estimates Committee of the House of Commons that the amount voted should correspond to the estimated require-ments of the Board. Up to the appearance of the estimates for the financial year 1930-31, the accumulated reserves of the Empire Marketing Fund were fully protected by the insertion of a note in the estimates presented to the United Kingdom Parliament to the effect that the sum appearing in the estimate was on account and that provision for the balance of the full amount of  1 million, together with any sums short-issued or short-voted in previous years to the fund, would be made good either by a supplementary estimate or by an addition to future estimates when the money was required for the purposes of the fund. -207. In that year, no such note was inserted in the estimates and the accumulated reserves were swept away, though His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom did not withdraw their previous general undertaking to provide such sums as might be necessary for the work of the Board. In the financial crisis of 1931, the Board surrendered a further sum of  110,000. This surrender was effected by a short issue of that amount from the Exchequer in that year.208. At the outset of its work, when the Board confidently anti-cipated that in each successive year it would have an income of  1 million, it entered into a number of substantial commitments in respect of future years. These commitments in no case extended beyond a period of five years, and all liabilities in respect of such commitments were fully covered by the reserves accumulated by the Board. The latter, as already explained, disappeared at the beginning of the year 1931-32, with the result that since that date there has been no financial cover for these commitments.209. The constant fluctuations in the financial resources of the Board have had a disturbing influence upon its work, though up till 1931 the Board always had sufficient funds to make research grants to organisations that could establish a good case. Since the financial crisis of that year, the Board has been compelled to ask institutions receiving grants to curtail all but essential services. The Board has only been able to maintain its existing research grants at approximately their previous level by making no new research grants and by severely &apos; cutting publicity expenditure, which now only covers minimum requirements.210. The Board has never adopted any geographical distribution of its funds, holding that the interests of the several parts of the
Empire were best served by grants being made towards objects of the greatest value to the Empire without regard to where in the Empire the money was actually expended.211. The Board has endeavoured wherever possible to avoid making grants covering the whole cost of proposed research schemes by arranging for some other authority to make some contribution thereto, the Board&apos;s grant often being fixed on a   for   basis. In the majority of cases where such matching grants have been made, the expenditure has actually been incurred in one of the Dominions.(e) The headquarters expenditure of the Board212. The headquarters expenditure of the Board in 1931 and 1932 represented about 12 per cent, of its total expenditure. The greater part of this was in respect of salaries, this item showing a 50 per cent, increase between 1927 and 1932. This increase reflects a change in the activities of the Board in the intervening period. In its earlier years, the Board concentrated a large part of its attention on work which could be undertaken on its behalf by existing institutions in the case of research and with a very small staff in the case of publicity (e.g., that for the press publicity campaign of the earlier years).213. Later, the Board was pressed, mainly at the request of certain of the Dominion representatives, to extend the part of its work that was actually carried out by officers of the Board, e.g., work on such questions as statistics, market intelligence, economic investigation, and market promotion. This work can only be carried out by an expert staff, the appointment of which has led to the increase in expenditure noted above.(f) The research expenditure of the Board214. For accountancy purposes, the Board&apos;s expenditure on research falls into three categories. In the first are included grants administered by government Departments in the United Kingdom. These are either grants made direct to United Kingdom departments for extensions of their own work, or grants made to such departments as intermediaries between the Board and research institutes, the normal financial provision for which appears on their votes.215. The second category consists of a relatively small number of grants either to research institutions not directly dependent on a United Kingdom department, or in respect of ad hoc investigations which it was thought convenient should be administered through the agency of some United Kingdom Government department.216. The third category consists of grants made direct from the Empire Marketing Fund. These in most cases consist of grants made to government departments or institutions in the several Dominions, India, and the Colonial Empire.
217. One of the general principles followed by the Board in making grants for scientific research is that the proposed grant should be of interest to more than one Empire country and to as large a group of producers as possible. Over the wide range of * subjects in respect of which grants have been made by the Board, it has naturally not been possible to apply this principle with equal rigidity in every case, and a number of important grants of a national, as opposed to Imperial, character have been made by the Board. Subject to the exception of grants of this character, the grants provided for research-by the Board may in most cases be regarded as funds which would not have been available if the Board had not existed.218. The Board maintains close contact in regard to its research work with the trades interested (e.g., the fruit trade, the wool trade, etc.) and with producers&apos; boards (e.g., in the case of Australia and New Zealand). These appreciate the economic importance of the research work made possible by the Board&apos;s grants and in a number of cases they have themselves made suggestions for further research which have been adopted by the Board.219. As explained in paragraph 203 above, the Board does not normally undertake research direct, but works through some existing research organisation. Where the Board has actually established what amounts to a new research institution, e.g., that in regard to stored products at Slough, it has arranged for some existing body (in this case the Imperial College of Science and Technology) to assume charge of the new station.220. When grants have been made for research, the Board, while abstaining from interference with the technical conduct of the research, has taken all steps in its power to keep itself informed by means of written reports, personal visits and otherwise, of the pro-gress of the investigations which it has assisted. A further check of value is provided by the fact that grants are only made for a limited period and are not renewed unless the institution is able to demonstrate to the Board the value of the work done and the need on economic grounds for further assistance.221. At different times the Empire Marketing Board has provided small sums to enable leading scientific workers in the United Kingdom to visit the Dominions, or similar workers in the Dominions to visit the United Kingdom. These grants cover travelling expenses and subsistence, but not the salaries of the officials concerned. In a number of other cases the Board has paid the travelling expenses of marketing officers from the Dominions, who have thus been enabled to visit the United Kingdom, study at first hand the conditions under which the products of their Dominion are marketed, and on their return home, in conjunction with their trades, to effect important
improvements in marketing methods which would not have been possible on the basis of information received without a personal visit.(g) Statistics, market intelligence, and economic investigations222. The policy of the Board in the field, of statistics; market intelligence, and economic investigation has been to provide a common service to supplement the work of existing agencies at home and overseas and, in particular, to fill up gaps in such services. The need for this service hi regard especially to competitive supplies was recognised by the Imperial Conference of 1930. Since that date, considerable progress has been made by the Board, but even to-day ! the service is far more modest in scale than that maintained by the United States. Speaking generally, the various trades in their own journals give full particulars regarding prices, but until the inauguration of the market intelligence service of the Board, no corresponding service existed in regard to supplies.(i) Market intelligence223. The intelligence notes published weekly by the Board have proved of marked value to the wholesale trade in the United Kingdom. In addition, a small number of retailers take advantage of the service. Copies of the weekly intelligence notes are issued free of charge to government departments in the Empire, to producers&apos; associations in the Empire, and to a certain number of individual Empire producers. The notes are also on sale and are largely bought by traders. As the Empire Marketing Board was established to assist oversea producers in the Empire, it is, in its opinion, reasonable that they should be given free copies of these notes but that a charge should be made for them to traders, the subsidising of whom was no part of the functions of the Board. From an Empire point of view the Board attaches great importance to the continuance of these services.224. The Imperial Conference of 1930 recognised the importance of securing improved grain inteUigence. Lack of funds has prevented the Board from establishing adequate machinery to this end, but a start has been made in the study at first hand of grain conditions in Russia and the Argentine.(ii) World surveys oj production and trade225. In response to requests from producers in the Empire for advice as to the probable future balance of supply and demand in respect of particular crops, the Board undertook a series of surveys of world production and trade in agricultural products of which the Empire is an important producer. These are intended to provide a complete statistical picture of individual commodities, and are
of value not only to the producers concerned, but also to those responsible for agricultural policy in the producing parts of the Empire. .&apos;    .226. A special conference of Empire representatives was summoned by the Board to consider proposals for developing this work. The Dominion representatives put forward suggestions regarding commodities in respect of which surveys are desirable, and it is on the basis of these suggestions that the programme has been settled by the Board.(iii) Retail market surveys227. The Board&apos;s retail market surveys have proved of recognised value to the retail trades. No similar work had previously been undertaken in the United Kingdom, and there is a long waiting list of markets for which surveys are desired.(iv) Statistical work228. The Board publishes two series of statistical pamphlets on Empire production, viz., the &quot; trade and production &quot; series, and the &quot; commodity &quot; series. The Board attaches great importance to its work in regard to wool statistics, where its object is to secure the highest possible measure of comparability in the statistics of the various wool-producing countries. As the British Empire has such a preponderating interest in wool production and as this work has-not been done internationally, it appeared a reasonable function for the Board to undertake.(v) Relations with other bodies229. The Board is satisfied that in the field of market intelligence there is no overlapping between its work and that of other official bodies. In the international field, there is certainly no overlapping with the International Institute of Agriculture at Rome. As regards United Kingdom government departments also there is no over-lapping. Close touch is maintained by the Board with the Imperial Economic Committee, with which overlapping in this field might theoretically be possible. In fact, the programmes of work are discussed and overlapping prevented by agreement as to division of function in regard to particular commodities.230. The High Commissioners or Trade Commissioners of the Dominions and India are represented either on the Board itself or on its committees. Frequent applications from these Com-missioners are received by the Board for statistical information, and the Board in return itself draws on the information possessed by the Commissioners. A number of services have been organised by the Board at the direct request of the High Commissioners&apos; offices. There is, in fact, no overlapping of function between the Board and the High Commissioners&apos; offices.
(h) Market promotion231. The work of market promotion is conducted by the Board through a Marketing Committee appointed in 1930, which is charged with the planning and supervision of activities designed to promote directly the selling of Empire products in the United Kingdom, The Board regards as an important feature of this work the creation and maintenance of close relations with the various trades and the development of the Board as a centre of expert knowledge of the commercial handling of Empire products.232. The Board&apos;s work in this field consists of (a) a continuing campaign of direct approach to bulk purchasers of commodities, designed to guide their purchases into Empire channels, (b) trade canvasses for particular commodities and (c) the establishment of trade committees.233. The function of the trade committees is to maintain close contact with the retail trade throughout the country, and to advise on the marketing of existing commodities and on the prospects of marketing new commodities of Empire origin. These committees have conferred with representatives of the producers of a large number of Empire commodities. The High Commissioners and Trade Commissioners of the Dominions and India are kept in close touch with this work, which is of a type more easily undertaken from a single centre such as the Empire Marketing Board than independently from each of the High Commissioners&apos; offices.234. The functions of the marketing officers of the Board are to devise means of arranging for the substitution in the minds of purchasers (e.g., local authorities, public institutions, hospitals, etc.) of a demand for Empire products in place of a demand foi foreign products, and to do this without causing friction between any of the several Dominions.235. In the opinion of the Board, its market promotion activities are of real value. Their cost is small, (about  6,000 for salaries and travelling expenses) both absolutely and also in relation to the value of the work performed.(i) The Board&apos;s publicity work236. Publicity was a comparatively little tried field of government activity when the Empire Marketing Board was constituted. If it had been practicable the Board would have desired to devote a substantially higher percentage of their funds to publicity work. That they have been unable to do so is due to several causes. In the first place, the Board quickly realised that the usefulness of publicity for Empire products was conditioned by the quality of the supplies available, and that quality could only be improved
by research. This is one of the reasons why so large a percentage of the board&apos;s funds has been devoted to fostering agricultural research.237. Another reason which prompted the Board to proceed circumspectly in the development of its publicity work was the realisation that for.this work, when.undertaken by government, there was required a new technique which could only be obtained as a result of preliminary investigations. Finally, financial exigencies have in recent years led to a retrenchment of the Board&apos;s expenditure on publicity. This was possible because the publicity programme is settled annually, whereas in the case of scientific research, sub-stantial commitments have been entered into by the Board in respect of the income of future years.238. The Board&apos;s publicity work is divided between two main committees, viz., its Publicity Committee, and its Film Committee. In the Board&apos;s early days, its publicity took the form mainly of press advertising, the exhibition of posters on hoardings, and the grant of financial assistance to exhibitions. Later, as experience was accumulated, the Board devoted increased attention to such forms of publicity as those afforded by its poster frames and its film unit.239. Large sums were at one time expended by the Board on press advertisement. This was of special value when the Board was engaged in establishing a background for its work. The poster frames of the Board have proved of great value in making its work known to the public, though recently doubts have been expressed whether their value is as great as formerly. Reproductions of the Board&apos;s posters have been very widely distributed to the schools, especially in the United Kingdom where they have served as a valuable form of publicity. The Board has issued large quantities of free material for retail shop window dressing. Over seven million copies of more than 200 different kinds of display material have been issued in this way.240, The Board&apos;s exhibition work consists (i) in its arranging for Empire participation in exhibitions, and (ii) in its work for Empire shops. In the case of exhibitions, the Board provides space in its pavilion free of charge to Empire countries wishing to display and sell samples of their produce. In the case of Empire shops, the Board provides funds for the hiring of a shop on a prominent site and for the fitting of a new shop front. The shop is then placed free of charge at the disposal of Empire countries for a fortnight at a time for the display of their produce and for the sale of samples. Care is taken by the Board to prevent friction with local retailers. The High Commissioners and Trade Commissioners are kept in the closest touch with the organsiation of Empire shops, and the selection of the towns in which shops should be established is determined
at the periodical meetings of the Standing Conference of Dominion and Colonial representatives to which reference has been made in paragraph 196 above.241. In its eajly days the Board spent considerable sums on arranging &quot; general interest&quot; lectures. These are to-day less necessary than formerly and expenditure under this head has been reduced. Since 1930 the Board has concentrated about 70 per cent, of its lectures upon rural districts which cannot be so easily reached by the other forms of the Board&apos;s publicity.242. The main film activities of the Board include (i) the mainten-ance of a unit for the production and editing of films for both theatrical and non-theatrical purposes, and (ii) the maintenance of a library of films for use in schools and other non-theatrical agencies. In addition, the Board pays for the maintenance of a cinema at the Imperial Institute.243. It is especially with non-theatrical films that the Board has made substantial progress. In this field, it has secured a very wide circulation for its films in schools, adult education bodies, the Y.M.C.A., and similar organisations. Its films are mainly document-tary, a type of film normally not held in high regard for theatrical purposes, being classed either as &quot; scenics &quot; or &quot; interest films.&quot; It is satisfactory, therefore, to find how advantageously the Board has been able to place, for theatrical purposes, a substantial number of its films during the last twelve months. The whole of the Board&apos;s films are produced by its own unit.244. The Board attaches importance to the maintenance of a film library and catalogue, and would like to see the establishment in each Dominion of such a library, and arrangements made for the interchange of material between such libraries. In this connection, the Board has received very valuable assistance from the important film libraries established in Canada. At present, the Board is only able to fulfil some fifteen per cent, of the demands received by its film library from schools in the United Kingdom.245. Until recently, the photographic work of the Board&apos;s film unit was confined to the United Kingdom, but lately, the Board has been able to attach a producer to the Admiralty Survey party in Labrador waters, and to arrange for another of its producers to undertake a tour (at very little cost to the Board) in the West Indies.246. In general the Board considers that its publicity work has been successful in establishing in the United Kingdom a background of interest in the Empire and its products, but believes that if work in this field was discontinued the tendency of purchasers to ask for Empire goods which the Board has done so much to foster would decrease.
247. The Dominion High Commissioners. and their offices are specially equipped for certain types of publicity, but general Empire publicity of the type undertaken by. the Board must, in its opinion, if it is to be effective, be carried out centrally. If each Dominion High Commissioner attempted to undertake publicity work of the scope of that conducted by the Board, the aggregate expenditure by the several Dominion High Commissioners would greatly exceed that of. the Board.248. When it was first established, the Board sought to establish voluntary preferences by consumers for Empire goods, in what was then a Free Trade market. As might be expected, these voluntary preferences related mainly to agricultural produce and raw materials, as it was mainly to benefit these that the Board was established. The Board considers that the need for Empire publicity in this field has by no means ceased as a result of the establishment of certain additional tariff preferences as a result of the Imperial Economic Conference, Ottawa. Indeed, in its view, there is as a result of the Ottawa agreements an increased need for Empire publicity.
PART 2PROPOSALS FOR ALTERATIONS AND MODIFICATIONS OF EXISTING MACHINERY249. Having surveyed the existing agencies for economic con-sultation and co-operation within the Empire, we - now consider what modifications, if any, should be made in the existing machinery, irrespective of how that machinery is to fit into whatever general scheme may ultimately be recommended. In other words, in considering this question, we are not concerned with the problem, discussed later in Part 3, of the relation of these institutions to one another as units in any larger scheme, but only with that of their maintenance as separate entities for the performance of specific services. In the case, however, of the Executive Council of the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux and the Institutes of Entomology and Mycology, proposals for modification can hardly be divorced from questions of co-ordination r250. It should also be mentioned that in this section we do not deal with the Empire Marketing Board or the Imperial Economic Committee, both of which bodies are so closely connected with the larger question of methods of consultation and co-operation that it seems advisable to consider them in that context.251. In surveying the existing agencies we have divided them into three main groups : (1) bodies of a permanent character, the main function of which is the dissemination of particular classes of information to the governments of the Empire ;(2) bodies, usually of a temporary character, engaged on particular pieces of ad hoc research or investigation of interest either to the Empire as a whole, or to several parts of the Empire ;(3) bodies of a purely advisory character, each dealing with a limited subject.A. BODIES THE MAIN FUNCTION OF WHICH IS THE DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION252. The inter-Imperial bodies, the main function of which is the dissemination of information, are themselves by no means uniform either in organisation or function. Broadly speaking, however, they fall into three main groups, viz. : (a) the scientific information bureaux ;(b) the Imperial Forestry Institute, Oxford ;(c) the Imperial Institute.
(i) The scientific information bureaux253. There&apos;are at the present time some twelve bodies-performing bureau services (excluding for the moment the Imperial Institute which is dealt with separately below).  These are(i) the eight Imperial Agricultural Bureaux, which are linked with one another for administrative and financial purposes under a single Executive Council;(ii) the Imperial institute (formerly Bureau) of Entomology;(iii) the Imperial Mycological Institute (formerly Bureau) ;(iv) the Bureau of. Hygiene and Tropical Diseases ;(v) the bureau services of the Imperial Forestry Institute, Oxford.254. We feel that the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux are performing satisfactorily a scientific function, the need for which is admitted. Theoretically the services performed by these bureaux might be performed on an international basis, but, in fact, this basis does not exist. To some extent work in this field is carried on by national effort, but the case for wider action on a co-operative Imperial basis has, we think, been proved, and is being met by the bureaux.255. We also agree that the policy of placing each bureau at some University or institute actually conducting research in the same subject is essentially sound, and that any attempt to group the bureaux in a.single centre would prove unworkable.256. Further, it is desirable that the bureaux, while naturally remaining in close touch with the research institutes in which they are lodged, should remain, as at present, administratively distinct. This would incidentally enable a bureau to be moved with the minimum of inconvenience to another institute in any part of the Empire if experience suggested that this was desirable.257. No fault is found with the fact that the existing bureaux are all located in institutes in the United Kingdom, but we wish to emphasise our view that institutions in other parts of the Empire should be given an opportunity, should an occasion arise of accepting responsibility for, and of benefiting from the stimulus involved in, the performance of bureaux services.258. There is general agreement that the form of administrative and financial control over these bureaux by the Executive Council and its composition are satisfactory for the discharge of the duties entrusted to it. On grounds of convenience and efficiency no change is recommended. At the same time there is from the constitutional point of view a technical flaw in its composition, which unless
remedied might prejudice its acceptance as a model for other inter-Imperial organisations. Though all parts of the Empire are repre-sented on the Council and all contribute to its funds, the United Kingdom has three representatives (representing respectively the Agriculture Departments in England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland). In practice this arrangement has proved valuable owing to the fact that not all the bureaux are located in England and Wales, and if the functions of the Council were to remain unaltered we should not recommend that its composition be changed. But if, as we recommend later, its functions were to be changed so as to include the control of other organisations, it might be advisable to equalise the numerical representation of the participating governments. The United Kingdom delegation have indicated that no difficulty would be raised on this score by their Government.259. We turn now to the two older bureaux (the Imperial Institutes of Entomology and Mycology) which do both abstracting and identification work.260. The abstracting work of these Institutes has been of value to the whole of the Empire and should be continued. For this work, however, adequate financial support is essential, as well as careful supervision of expenditure. In this connection we suggest that it is unreasonable that (contrary to what is done in the case of the I Agricultural Bureaux) every advantage, including free copies of the bureaux publications, should be enjoyed by.governments which have withdrawn or suspended their subscriptions. We feel that normally, though possibly not in all cases, it is undesirable that such services should be rendered to parts of the Commonwealth which have not contributed to their cost during any considerable period. A change of policy in this respect might cause expenses to fall and revenues to rise.261. The organisation of the Institutes differs essentiaUy from that of the Agricultural Bureaux discussed in the preceding paragraphs. Their constitutions were determined prior -to the definition of Dominion status by the Imperial Conference of 1926, and are not in accordance with the constitutional position as then laid down. The personnel of their managing bodies is mainly scientific and the Dominion Governments are either not represented on them or are represented in an inadequate manner.262. We were not given to believe that the cessation or reduction of certain Dominion subscriptions to these Institutes was due to dissatisfaction with the constitution of their governing bodies, but rather that it was the result, primarily, of the financial difficulties of recent years. At the same time, we feel that more adequate Dominion representation on these bodies would have enabled the importance of their work to be put more effectively before the Dominion Governments concerned.   Even, therefore, if the Institutes
were to remain independent organisations, their governing bodies should be re-organised so as to give full representation to. each government participating in their work.263. This would probably result in the conversion of the governing bodies into predominantly lay organisations. Some fear was expressed by witnesses that this might be prejudicial to the efficient conduct of the scientific work of the Institutes. We do not subscribe to this fear. Certainly it has not been the case with the Executive Council of the Agricultural Bureaux. To remove any uneasiness on this score, however, the existing scientific committees of manage-ment might, we suggest, be reconstituted as scientific advisory committees, available for consultation by the Director on scientific, as opposed to administrative and financial, questions, which latter would fall under the supervision of the new managing council.264. The recommendations above as to the desirability of some re-organisation of the governing bodies of the older Institutes, bring up the question whether, in this re-organisation, it would not be conducive to order and efficiency if these Institutes were brought within the ambit of the Executive Council of the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux. If some consolidation did not coincide with the necessary re-organisation, it would probably mean that there would be three Empire committees, consisting to some extent of the same people, supervising the work of the eight Bureaux and the two Institutes respectively.265. We recognise that the Institutes differ from the Bureaux in that they, carry-on investigation as well as information services. Their research work, however, mainly takes the form of identification-tion of specimens and is closely in harmony with their information and abstracting work. The difference, therefore, is more apparent than real. It was suggested that this difficulty might be overcome by making a theoretical division of the income of the Institutes as between (i) bureaux services and (ii) research work, and by paying the bureau portion into the same fund as the Agricultural Bureaux, the research portion being also paid to the Executive Council, but being specially earmarked for the Institutes in question.266. To sum up, we recommend that the Executive Council of the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux should take over the administra-tion and financial control of the Institutes of Entomology and Mycology. .   .267. The Bureau of Hygiene and Tropical Diseases, which pro-vides a most valuable information service in its field, was also considered. It is administered by a committee appointed by the United Kingdom Government, and is financed both by contributions from various governments of the Empire which are interested, and
by the sale of publications. We do not suggest any changes in this institution, which seems to be functioning efficiently on its present basis. -(ii) The Imperial Forestry Institute, Oxford268. It is not practicable to discuss the information services of the Imperial Forestry Institute apart from its other functions of providing training in forestry and acting as a centre for research, and we propose therefore to deal at this point with the whole of the work of this body.269. It is clear that the Institute is in a very unsatisfactory financial position. Its income is inadequate and, moreover, tending to decrease. Apart from contributions received through the . Colonial Office from a number of Colonial governments its main source of income is a grant from the United Kingdom Forestry Commission. The Dominions are not represented on the governing body, and the subscriptions that certain of them give are very small. The position of the Institute is, moreover, anomalous in that although it is a governmental body, it is very closely associated with the University of Oxford. The practical inconvenience of this was recognised by the Director, who in his evidence welcomed an arrangement now in process of negotiation by which the Institute would definitely become a department of the University.270. The Institute has been of considerable value to the Colonial Empire, and some of the Dominions have derived benefit from it. It is, however, very doubtful if the Institute is an &quot; Imperial&quot; organisation in the same sense as, say, the Imperial Institute of Entomology.271. We realise that the work of the Institute has been efficiently carried on, and we hope that it may soon be placed on a satisfactory basis as a result of the present negotiations with the University. If these negotiations succeed, we believe that its value as a centre for the training of forest officers of the Colonial Empire may well be increased.   It is, however, not likely to receive any considerable financial support from the Dominions.   It would be a matter for I those concerned to consider whether some or aU of the teaching and research functions should be transferred to the University of Oxford.   If Dominion Governments wished to avail themselves of the facilities of the Institute, they could send forest officers there, I as some do at present, on a fee basis.   This fee should in future H cover the full cost of the training provided.272. The information services of the Institute present a special problem. In so far as there is a need for these services, the question has been raised whether the bureau providing them might possibly be situated in India at Dehra Dun or in Canada, both of whichI:
countries possess extensive forests and seem in some respects more suitable for the purpose than the United Kingdom. We would recommend, therefore, that the next Imperial Forestry Conference be asked to consider in detail and report to the Empire governments (i) whether there is, in fact, need for an Empire Forestry Bureau and (ii) if so, where it should be placed.273. So far as the Standing&apos; Committee on Empire Forestry is concerned, it might be found desirable to locate it where any Empire Forestry Bureau is established. Pending the receipt of definite recommendations on this point, however, from the Imperial Forestry Conference, we see no need for any change in this Committee.(iii) The Imperial Institute274. The functions of the Imperial Institute, which are at present defined.by the United Kingdom Act of 1925, fall into two main groups, viz. (i) intelligence and investigation work and (ii) the Exhibition Galleries.275. The intelligence and investigation work is divided into two main branches each organised as a separate sub-division of the Institute, viz. : (a) the Mineral Resources Department;(&amp;) the Plant and Animal Products Department.276. Each of these departments, which deal with wholly unrelated subjects, is somewhat analogous in function to an Imperial bureau, more especially to the older ones such as the Imperial Institute of Entomology which conduct investigations as well as disseminate information. Indeed the Mineral Resources Department was until the last re-organisation of the Institute a separate Imperial Bureau and was only incorporated with it to put a stop to the overlapping in this field, which then existed.277. The whole history of the organisation of scientific services during the past forty years and also the evidence placed before us indicate the difficulties in modern conditions of maintaining a single institution such as the Imperial Institute charged with the duty of disseminating information and conducting investigations in regard to a wide range of highly diverse products each calling for a high degree of specialised knowledge. Certainly no one would suggest to-day setting up an &quot; Imperial &quot; institution, responsibility/ for the administration of which was vested in a government department of a single part of the Commonwealth.278. The Institute was, indeed, conceived at a time during the last century when conditions were very different, from what they are now. Constant adjustments have, therefore, been necessary to meet changing conditions and it is doubtful whether this process of adjustment can continue in the future.
279. We are ungrudging in our tribute to the efficiency and value of the services of the Institute in the past. We have no doubt that this efficiency would be shown in the future also, but, in the altered conditions, we are less certain as to the value of, or need for, the services which result from it. To an increasing degree the oversea parts of the Empire are undertaking&apos; their own work in regard to investigation, information, and exhibition services. An illustration of the latter is provided by the development of exhibitions at the offices of the High Commissioners in London where facilities for displays have been provided in such a way as to make it unlikely that the oversea governments would support the Institute in the future as they have in the past.280. Certain other work performed by the Institute is also being increasingly undertaken by the governments themselves. This means that those governments would find growing difficulty in justifying to their Parliaments continued support to the Institute. At the same time the finances of the Institute which are to-day highly precarious, would, we were informed, be critical by 1937, when the Reserve Fund will be completely exhausted (see appendix 2, table 2). Providing there is no increase in government or private contributions, the Institute will by that year have to undergo severe re-organisation or be closed down.281. We recognise that owing to the circumstances of its origin and the length of its existence, the Institute has a sentimental value above that which can be measured in terms of concrete services rendered. We feel, however, bound to point out that if on these, grounds financial support is to be given, it would be necessary for that support to be on a substantially larger scale than in recent years. Partial support would involve the re-organisation of the Institute in such a way as to cut it from its past, thus weakening, if not destroying, the sentimental value that now attaches to it. Such re-organisation would not, we feel, be a satisfactory solution. Failing the grant of adequate support, the most satisfactory method would be for the governments concerned to consider how such of the activities as it was desired to retain might be transfered to other agencies.282. In that event, arrangements could perhaps be made for conducting, on behalf of the Colonial Empire, the services at present rendered by the Plant and Animal Products Department of the Institute. Those Dominions that desired to take advantage of the facilities afforded might do so on an adequate fee basis.283. The Mineral Resources Department might be reconstituted as an Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau, if the governments of the Empire should, after thorough consideration, recommend the re-establishment of such a body.
. 1284. The Exhibition Galleries are even less likely to receive Dominion support in the future than the. other phases of the Instituted activities.B. BODIES ENGAGED ON AD HOC INVESTIGATIONS285. Two only of the bodies specifically referred to us are of an avowedly ad hoc character. They are the Oversea Mechanical Transport Council and the Empire Timbers Committee. Both bodies were set&apos; up to supervise the conduct of investigations financed either wholly or substantially by the Empire Marketing Board. Both investigations will come to an abrupt end in September next if the Empire Marketing Board ceases to exist and no alternative method of financing them is forthcoming.286. With regard to the Oversea Mechanical Transport Council, the completion of its present programme will cost approximately  32,000 and is expected to demonstrate the practicability of a 30-ton mechanical transport unit as an alternative to branch railways in less developed parts of the Empire. It has been suggested that if this can be proved to the satisfaction of the interested governments of the Empire, private enterprise can be relied upon to develop the vehicles on a commercial basis with important economic results to newly developed countries and to the motor manufacturing industries of the more industrialised countries, but that otherwise it is not likely that the work would be carried on.287. Our discussions showed that there was no likelihood of this undertaking being conducted as a joint Imperial effort, as only certain Empire governments are interested in this work. It remains, therefore, for those governments to consider whether they are willing to co-operate for the completion of the programme.288. With regard to the Empire Timbers Committee we are in general agreement that this Committee is performing its functions satisfactorily. We feel, however, that if the Committee is to be supported in the future by contributions from the several parts of the Empire it should be constituted on an Empire basis and should not be, as it is at present, a committee of a United Kingdom Govern-ment department (the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research). We&apos; recommend that so far as the immediate future is concerned, the work at present performed by the Committee should be considered along with the other Empire Marketing Board services in the manner recommended in paragraph 341 below.C-SPECIALIST ADVISORY BODIES289. Two of the bodies included in our survey, namely, the Imperial Shipping Committee and the Imperial Communications Advisory Committee may be regarded as specialist advisory committees.
- 290. The Imperial Communications Advisory Committee is a highly specialist body and its composition is representative of the Empire governments concerned on a.basis of complete equality. We have no suggestions to make with regard to it.291. As regards the Imperial Shipping Committee, we feel that its work has been, and is being, carried on efficiently and economically and is of definite value to the Empire as a whole.&apos; There are, however, certain changes in its organisation that we think should be effected.292. In the first place, we feel that the formal appointment of the representatives of oversea governments on,the-Committee should be made by their governments and not by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.293. We feel also that arrangements should be made by. which the non-governmental members of the Committee (i.e., the five members &quot; experienced in shipping and commerce &quot; and the repre-sentative of civil aviation) should be appointed after due consultation with the various governments. We hope that in the future in respect to any such appointment, governments will be consulted through their representatives on the Committee.294. We agree also that on a change of Chairman it would be more appropriate if the Chairman were in future elected by the members of the Committee.295. It would also be desirable if it were recognised that the secretary of the Committee is the servant of the Committee and not of any of the participating governments. At the same time we realise that considerations of economy and efficiency might make it desirable to use the part-time services of an officer of any one of the participating governments for the discharge of the duties of the post.296. We recommend that in future the funds required for the Imperial Shipping Committee should be contributed by the participat-ing governments on some appropriate basis and not as in the past be provided by any single government. In that event, a further question relating to the method of publication of the Committee&apos;s reports would arise. At present these are published as Command Papers presented to the United Kingdom Parliament. This provides a cheap and easy method of securing for the Committee&apos;s reports that publicity which is so essential, but on the change recommended above being made, the reports of the Committee should ordinarily be published either simultaneously by the participating governments or in London (or elsewhere in the Empire) at the expense of the Committee.
D. RECOMMENDATIONS APPLICABLE GENERALLY TO EXISTING AGENCIES297. We desire to make here certain recommendations that apply to all the institutions which in the previous paragraphs we have suggested should be retained as agencies for economic co-operation within the Empire. They would, we think, apply equally to any new inter-Imperial bodies which may be established.298. These general recommendations are as follows : (a) The complete constitutional equality of the participating governments should be recognised in the method of appointment to, and composition and organisation of, each agency.(b) The formal instrument appointing persons as members of inter-Imperial agencies should be issued by each government concerned.(c) Adequate financial provision should be. forthcoming. This implies not only sufficient funds but also a reasonable certainty of income over a definite period of years.id) At the same time, there should be careful and periodical examination of the various institutions at Empire conferences suitable for the purpose, as without this assurance governments could hardly be expected to. provide financial support as visualised in (c) above.(e) The managing bodies of inter-Imperial agencies should in no way be subject to financial control by the Finance Depart -ment of any one government of the Commonwealth, but over and above regular scrutiny by a suitably constituted finance committee, they should be free to take advantage of the exper-ience of such departments.(/) Each inter-Imperial agency should approach the partici-pating governments directly through the appropriate channel.We anticipate that such communications would normally take one or other of two main forms. On formal questions, such as the presentation of estimates, communications would be addressed by the secretary of the agency concerned to the governments concerned. In the case of the Dominions, India, and Southern Fdiodesia this would be through the High Com-missioner or other official principal representative of those governments in London, and in the case of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Colonial Empire it would be through the appropriate Minister.   On more
important questions of policy we assume that the representatives on the agency concerned would themselves take- steps to obtain the views of their respective governments.(g) As a general rule to which, however, exceptions may at times be necessary, Imperial - organisations should serve only those members of the Commonwealth that subscribe to their funds or pay for such services on a fee basis.
PART 3MEANS FOR FACILITATING ECONOMIC CONSULTATION AND CO-OPERATION BETWEEN THE SEVERAL GOVERNMENTS OF THE COMMONWEALTH299. We have now completed our survey of existing agencies for economic consultation and co-operation within the Commonwealth, and have put forward such proposals for their modification as we think desirable. We propose now to consider the problem of co-operation from a broader standpoint. In the following section we discuss the principles underlying co-operation and the various methods by which it can be effected. Finally, we set out our general proposals under this head.A.-PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING CO-OPERATION300. The occasion afforded by the meeting of the present Com-mittee is the first opportunity that representatives of governments of the several parts of the Commonwealth have had of reviewing as a whole the work of the various inter-Imperial organisations since they were established, and, in the light of that review, of presenting before their several governments a considered statement of their conclusions on the value of the work noW being done. This is, in itself, an important stage in the history of co-operation between the several parts of the Commonwealth in the field of scientific investigation and economic services and inquiry.301. The survey which we have made of existing bodies shows in the most striking fashion how varied they are in origin, constitution and function. - Each of them sprang into being at the moment when the need for the services which it performs became apparent to the governments of the several parts of the Empire, and though in many cases, modifications in their work have taken place from time to time, their organisation to-day is substantially the same as it was when they were first established. Their activities have as a common object the promotion of the welfare of the Commonwealth and of its several parts, but, in general, each has worked independently in its own field. In many cases, especially in matters relating to scien-scientific research, these fields are relatively clearly defined and the need for a closer organic relationship with each other has not been apparent to the bodies themselves.302. In the consideration of the question of co-operation, we have few precedents to guide us. Every step taken must of necessity be tentative and experimental, for it is only by a process of trial and error that effective co-operation in regard to economic and scientific questions can be developed between the several states that together make up the British Commonwealth. The need for, and the value of,,
such co-operation is, however, beyond question, and the task with which we are confronted is to suggest to our several governments the means of which it may best be effected.: 303. Constitutional changes resulting from the Imperial Con-ference of 1926, embodied subsequently in the Statute of West-minster, demand far-reaching changes in the method by which the problem of co-operation should be approached. When, nearly half a century ago, the several parts of the Empire decided on a joint effort at closer co-operation in regard to scientific research and investigation and economic intelligence and inquiry, it was natural that the authors of the scheme then adopted should suggest the establishment in London of a single institution for, the prosecution of these varied objects. The Imperial Institute, which was the out-come of that effort has played a valuable role as the pioneer among inter-Imperial organisations. The&apos; difficulties, however, with which the Institute has been faced from time to time, and the process by which it has gradually divested itself, first of one and then of another of its functions, suggest that it was not constituted in such a way as to enable it to meet the changed conditions of to-day. These con-ditions which in the constitutional field have led to the recognition of the complete equality of the Dominions with the United Kingdom make the present a peculiarly suitable opportunity for examining existing inter-Imperial bodies, many of which were established prior to the formulation of the present conception of Dominion status, and, therefore, require changes in constitution to bring them into conformity with the realities of the situation so created.304. Most of the bodies which we have surveyed were established in the course of the last twenty years, and indicate the recognition at successive points by the governments of the Commonwealth of the need for co-operation in defined fields of activity. Along with this process, however, other developments have been taking place in the United Kingdom and in the Dominions. In earlier days, the Dominions tended to a much larger degree to rely upon the United Kingdom for developments of knowledge, especially in the field of scientific research, but as time went on, they proceeded to establish for themselves in varying forms and in differing degrees agencies both for the prosecution of scientific research and also for the study of the various aspects of economic intelligence and inquiry. Thus, the natural and cultural resources of the Dominions developed with their growth in national consciousness and economic integration.305. Side by side, however, with this progressive decentralisation of the Commonwealth, there have also developed new opportunities for co-operation, and a need for new methods tomeet them. Thus, we recognise to-day that the co-operation we seek must be looked for not only in London, but also in Canberra and Cape Town, Wellington and other capitals in the Commonwealth. Further, we recognise that to-day there is a need for the establishment of agencies not only
149for co-operation between the United Kingdom and the Dominions/ but also for co-operation between the several Dominions themselves. The United Kingdom will long hold a predominant position by reason of its scientific and economic achievements as well as in the numbers of qualified workers that it possesses in these fields. London will remain the most important focussing and contact point, but in their varying ways, Ottawa, Dublin and Delhi, St. John&apos;s and Salisbury have won for themselves an essential place in any scheme for inter-Imperial co-operation.306. In the field especially of scientific research, every country stands to geiin by discoveries made in every other country, but no progressive country, and especially no young one, can afford to rely entirely upon results won from the unknown by workers in other, parts of the world. National development can only be effected by national effort, and it is for this reason that research activities form an indispensible and integral part of the intellectual life of a nation. Universities will only grow famous if their members have before them the ideal of adding something, however little, to-the existing store of knowledge as well as passing on to the next generation the heritage they received from the last. Again, in the. field of industry, business firms or associations that desire to take the lead must either themselves, or in co-operation with others,, undertake scientific research and seek out ways for its application to cpmmercial ends. In every country it is the duty of government to aid, so far as it can, the conduct of pure and applied research, and in the fields best suited to government action to co-ordinate and supplement the constantly developing work of educational, industrial and commercial agencies.307. It would, however, be a grave error to suppose that the development of national agencies for the conduct of scientific research implies that co-operation between research workers and research organisations in one country and those in another is less important to day than formerly.308.- In fact, the exact opposite is the case. Recent developments have witnessed an unparalleled development in scientific knowledge and discovery, and this development has been accompanied by, if it has not been the result of, an immense increase in specialisation within the several fields of scientific activity. To take an example, it is no longer possible for a man to be a zoologist in the sense that it was possible even twenty years ago, as to-day the growth of scientific knowledge demands that a professional zoologist should specialise in the study of some relatively small section of the animal kingdom. The number of such specialists in any one country must be comparatively small, and the need for their collaboration with colleagues in other countries has correspondingly increased.309. But it is not only in regard to pure research that collabora-tion is required among workers in various countries.   It is equally
essential in the field of research directed to a definitely utilitarian object. Utilitarian research of this type forms to-day a normal function of government, and in every country there will be found establishments engaged in the prosecution of research problems, the solution of which is required to meet the day-to-day needs of producers and others in that country. The line dividing applied from pure research must of necessity often be ill defined, and in the pursuit of utilitarian ends research institutions are constantly thrown back upon first principles by being confronted with the need for the solution of some fundamental problem. The solution of such problems often leads to far-reaching changes in conditions of production or marketing, especially of agricultural produce, and it is work of this type that offers one of the most hopeful fields for co-operation between one country and another.310. The advance of knowledge that recent decades have witnessed in almost every department of scientific endeavour has put into the hands of man to-day means of dealing with the problems of nature undreamt of even two generations ago.   As one problem after another has yielded its secrets to the research worker, new ones not hitherto envisaged or but dimly apprehended have presented them-selves for solution.   At every stage the technique of investigation has been elaborated and refined by research workers in their attack upon the unknown.   Partly as the result of the increase in the volume of research activity and partly as the result of the specialisations-tion that has taken place, the period has witnessed an enormous increase in the number of scientific and technical journals.   Fifty years ago, it was possible for a research worker to keep himself fully abreast of his subject by reference to a limited number of journals most of which were readily accessible and were published in one or other of the principal European languages.   To-day, the scene is completely transformed, and it would be beyond the bounds of possibility for a worker, however specialised his branch of activity, to foUow unaided the developments in his science in&apos; other parts of the world.   The number of journals in which papers dealing with his subject may be published now runs into hundreds, and in the case of the older subjects, into thousands.   Moreover, owing to the growth of nationalism in the world, many are now published in the language of the country to which the author belongs, however, little known that may be to workers in other countries.   To meet the difficulties thus created, arrangements have been made, first in one field and then in another to issue journals containing abstracts or summaries of papers published in all parts of the world, and in all languages, relating to some specialised subject.   At first these were for the most part published by learned societies for the benefit of workers in their field, but in view of the growing cost of maintaining such services there has developed more l-ecently a tendency for responsibility for work of this kind to be undertaken by government.
311. Ideally, no doubt, such work, benefiting as it does the whole world, should be undertaken on an international basis, but the practical difficulties that Stand in the way have hitherto prevented this from being done. Such abstracting journals as exist to-day, though international in scope, and of interest to workers of all nationalities in-the field covered, are issued under national, or in the case of the British Commonwealth, under inter-Imperial, auspices. As we have seen from our survey of existing agencies, there has been great development in recent years in abstracting work for the benefit of the agricultural sciences. This development owes its origin to the recommendations of a conference held in 1927, representative of agricultural research workers in all parts of the Empire, and has been conducted on an inter-Imperial basis. The value of national effort is as great to-day as ever, but the co-operation between the several peoples of the Commonwealth in this matter has been fruitful of results of great value to agriculture, and indeed also to certain branches of human and veterinary medicine, in all parts of the Empire.312. Turning to economic inquiry, we find in progress a change of emphasis from scientific research in the narrow sense towards economic research, and a growing recognition of the need for govern-ment intervention in this field. The oldest and still the most in-dispensible form of government economic inquiry consists of the collection and marshalling of statistical data. In the social and economic sciences the method of inductive research by the collection and analysis of a wide range of facts is peculiarly appropriate to government action, and to-day, owing to the heavy cost involved and in many cases to the need for compulsory powers, if the in-formation collected is to be comprehensive in character, only governments are able to undertake this task effectively. With the constant growth of government activity in every sphere of the life of the community, every state now finds it necessary to consider how far it should co-ordinate its statistical services by the establish-ment of some organisation that can supervise such statistical work of national importance as it does not itself perform. But to-day less than ever is it possible for a state to maintain a policy of isolation from its feUows, and the correlation of its statistics with those of other countries is of more vital importance than previously.313. Inquiry into the wider aspects of economic policy has become more urgent with the growing sweep and variety of the problems which every government has to face, with the sudden transformation of&apos; the economic scene and with the calling in question of almost every policy and practice which have hitherto been accepted as axiomatic. Changing conditions demand, therefore, that govern-ments should have at their call economic experts systematically trained, and possessed of initiative, flexibility, and breadth of view. Some of the governments of the Commonwealth are seeking to
meet this situation by the creation of advisory agencies suited to the particular conditions of their national life, and it cannot be doubted that this process will gradually be extended in other parts of the Commonwealth. In this field also the need for co-operation on special problems between the countries.of the Common-wealth is apparent and we return to this subject later in our report.314. In modern conditions, market intelligence services and agencies for market promotion are an essential part of the organisation of government in every country. These are fields in which the state can be of direct assistance to its citizens and it is only right, therefore, that in so far as may be practicable these services should be under-taken by each government of the Commonwealth in&apos;the interests of its own people. This does not, however, imply that &quot;there may not be branches in the field of market intelligence and market promotion in which co-operative action between the peoples of the Common-wealth is desirable. . &apos; . -       &apos;315. To sum up, the period under review has witnessed a great development in national consciousness.and an increasing effectiveness of national organisation in the several parts of the Commonwealth, This growth has not, however, diminished, but has in fact increased the opportunities for, and the advantages to be derived from, co-operation both in regard to scientific investigation and economic inquiry. The best results can only be obtained from such co-operation if it is based upon a recognition of equality and is supported by vigorous and expanding national agencies. The economic problems with which the Commonwealth is faced are as difficult and stubborn as at any time in its history. They are not insoluble but their solution depends upon that free co-operation which the Imperial Conference of 1926 recognised as the instrument by which the Commonwelath will achieve its positive ideals.B. METHODS OF CONSULTATION AND. CO-OPERATION316. We have shown in our survey how in their several fields the existing inter-Imperial agencies are engaged on a co-operative basis in work of value in varying degrees to the several parts of the Common-wealth. For the most part, the continued existence of these bodies in some form is not in question and our suggestions for alterations and modifications have been directed more towards their organisation and financial basis than to the scope of their activities. There is, however, one important exception and that is the Empire Marketing Board. Here we have a body established in 1926 by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, charged with the duty of promoting the sale of Empire produce within the United Kingdom. The sum placed at the disposal of this body was intended to represent the money equivalent of the advantages which would have been conferred on the Empire overseas by the preferential duties, proposed
by the Imperial Economic Conference of 1923, which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom subsequently felt themselves precluded from granting.317. The conditions that led to the establishment of the Board have passed away with the extension in the last eighteen months of the fiscal preferences granted by the United Kingdom to the other parts of the Empire. His&apos;Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom indicated at the Imperial Economic Conference held at Ottawa that though they would continue to furnish any funds that might be required to finance essential work of the Board up to the end of September next, they did so only in order that the necessary time might be available for the preparation and consideration of our report on the existing and future machinery for economic co-opera-tion. within the Commonwealth. We are, therefore, faced with the position that the Board in its present form is due to pass out of existence in six months&apos; time and we are called upon to consider what methods should be adopted to discharge such of the functions of the Board as the governments of the Commonwealth may decide, as a result of our recommendations, to continue on a co-operative basis.318. The Empire Marketing Board, though from the financial point of view, a purely United Kingdom organisation, has always set before itself the aim of acting not in the interests of any one single member of the Commonwealth, but in the interests of the Common-wealth as a whole. We are glad to pay a warm tribute to the vision that has inspired the Board in its activities, to the devotion with which it has sought to further the ideal of co-operation, and to the excellent work accomplished by Sir Stephen Tallents and the members of his staff and by the large number of voluntary workers who have given long hours to the Board&apos;s service. In the seven years that have elapsed since its foundation, there has been a notable advance in inter-Imperial co-operation in the economic field and in regard to applied agricultural research. This has been due in considerable part to the Board. We refer in particular to the marked growth in recent years in the United Kingdom of sentiment in favour of Empire produce which we feel is largely the result of its work. Certain of its grants in aid of the research or economic services of one or other parts of the Empire were, however, not of a character which we anticipate would be made by an inter-Imperial body jointly financed and controlled by the several members of the Common-wealth. This does not mean that the services aided were not of Imperial significance but rather that in some cases their interest and value were in the main limited to a part of the Empire only. In making this comment we do not wish to detract from the value of the work of the Board, but merely to draw attention to a tendency that was natural, and, indeed, perfectly legitimate, having regard to the circumstances in which the Board was brought into existence.  It is
necessary for us to do this, as the point is of first-class importance in relation to the questions to be discussed later of organisation for future co-operative effort.319. At the moment the question before us is what form inter-Imperial co-operation should take in the fields at present covered by the Board. The problem with which we are confronted is thus one both subtle and far-reaching. It is how best in existing conditions the peoples of the British Commonwealth can arrange by free association to work together in the pursuit of objects of common interest to them all. The value of co-operation in the field of scientific investigation and economic inquiry is admitted on all hands, but the method by which such co-operation should be effected raises important questions on which there is rcom for some divergence of opinion.320. We have already referred to the growth alike in the United Kingdom and in the Dominions of national agencies for the conduct of scientific research and for the assistance of government in their approach to economic problems. We have expressed our view that this growth was both desirable and inevitable if the peoples of the Commonwealth were to develop to the full their natural and cultural resources.321. It is natural and right that&apos;the Parliaments and peoples of the United Kingdom and Dominions should feel that their first duty is to support and maintain agencies established in their own countries, and to examine any suggestions that may be made for co-operative action to ascertain whether the proposed service could not be more appropriately covered by a national agency. Viewed from this angle, the problem of co-operation between the several parts of the Commonwealth presents itself rather as a problem in the first instance of how to secure effective liaison in each separate field-between workers engaged in the investigation of subj ects of common interest to a number of parts of the Empire.322. As regards such pure research as aims only at adding to the world&apos;s store of knowledge, workers are in contact with their colleagues not only in the Empire but in all parts of the world, either personally, by direct correspondence, or through knowledge of each other&apos;s writings. It is thereforeenot principally with these that we are concerned, though the information provided by the Bureaux is of material service to them. We are concerned rather with workers engaged on research which, though of a fundamental character, is avowedly undertaken with a utilitarian object in view. The results of such research are often of general application and it is in this field that co-operation is likely to prove most fruitful.323. Men of science engaged on pure research are to-day widely organised in international associations that hold periodical meetings, for the discussion of problems relating to their subject.   It is a?
commonplace that the formal discussions at these meetings are of considerably less value than the opportunities which they present for the formation of personal contacts between workers in different parts of the world. The development of similar contacts between workers engaged in utilitarian research in the different parts of the Commonwealth is an important element in securing increased co-operation. Accordingly we consider that, with a view to the promotion of inter-Imperial co-operation, arrangements should be made for periodical conferences of representatives of national research organisations both for the discussion of the technical aspects of research work in progress and for the exchange of pro-grammes of work. These would be supplemented by an extension of the present arrangements for periodical conferences of specialist workers ie.g., entomologists, mycologists, physiologists, etc.)..-Such conferences also should consider possible methods of co-operation for recommendation to the various governments. Co-operation would, no doubt, on occasion be effected by varying means. In one case it might take the form of a special task entrusted to one national research organisation. In another, it might be effected through simultaneous inquiry into a common subject by a number of institutions operating as a team or, again, it might be effected by financial assistance being given by several or all of the governments of the Commonwealth to enable an institution situated in the United Kingdom or in one of the Dominions to undertake a special task of general interest to all the participating governments.324. Further, in the period between successive conferences, programmes of work should be exchanged between research organisations in the various parts of the Commonwealth. This would apply in the first instance to the exchange of programmes between national research organisations of general character, such as the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Council in Australia. Exchanges of programmes might also be effected from time to time between specialist bodies such as the Institutes of Animal Health at Weybridge and Onderstepoort.325. It is not, however, by periodical conferences only that personal contacts between research workers and administrative officers in charge of research organisations may be established and cemented. It may weU happen that the most effective form of co-operation in certain cases may be for a research worker in one part of the Empire either to exchange with a worker in another part or to be permitted for a limited period to work in a research laboratory in some other part of the Empire. Doubtless also occa-sions will arise in the future as they have in the past where it would be of great advantage to the Commonwealth as a whole if arrange-ments could be made for some leading specialist to visit in turn
research centres in the Empire and to discuss with his colleagues on the spot problems in regard to which he is a leading authority.326. In this approach to the problem of co-operation in regard to scientific research, the main features are the formation in each part of the Empire of effective national organisations and the develop-ment of means by which research workers and the administrative officers in charge of the research organisations in the several parts may establish close personal contacts with one a-ndther. Under this system, financial co-operation would be placed mainly on an ad hoc basis, and would take the form generally of supporting particular investigations on lines decided upon in the light of recom-mendations submitted by conferences of the administrative officers and scientific workers concerned.327. The methods of co-operation discussed above in relation to scientific research apply in general also to co-Opefation in the economic sphere. Thus, here also co-operation may be effected by the establishment of close relations between national organisa-tions engaged on economic investigations, and by periodical conferences of statisticians and other persons of special knowledge and experience in economic questions in the various parts of the Commonwealth. We would cite as an example of this form, of co-operation the conference of the statisticians of the Empire, which it is proposed should be held for the purpose of securing uniformity in methods of compilation and presentation of statistics of general importance to the Empire. This conference was to have been held in 1932, and though it was necessary then to postpone it, we hope that it will meet at an early date. Measures for co-operation by conference would be supplemented where desirable by ad hoc financial provision for special services of interest not only to indi-vidual members of the Commonwealth, but to the Commonwealth as a whole.328. We recognise, however, that there is another angle from which co-operation can be approached. This represents a point of view that is not inconsistent with that expressed in the preceding para-graphs, but is in many respects complementary to it. In so far as it differs it does so by placing greater emphasis on the need for centrally organised coUective action. From this standpoint such coUective action is of vital importance if the countries of the Commonwealth are to keep themselves abreast of world progress in regard not only to production but also to marketing and distribu-tion, and thus to aid the development of their trade.329. To take scientific research as an example, there are certain types of investigation that can best be carried out on a co-operative basis, and for the conduct of which particular parts of the Empire offer special advantages. Co-operative action of this kind demands co-operative control.   Such control would best be exercised by a
body with strictly limited powers, representative of the several parts of the Commonwealth and responsible individually and directly to each of those parts. An inter-Imperial body established for such a purpose would naturally be constituted on the general lines that we have already indicated as desirable in the second part of our report. Thus, it would be based on a recognition of the complete equality of the participating governments and, subject to the collective control by those governments, would enjoy absolute freedom in regard to organisation and financial control.330. The establishment of a central organisation for the promotion of research within the Commonwealth would raise the question of the need for the co-ordination, and possibly the re-organisation, of existing inter-Imperial agencies for economic services also by group-ing them as units of a larger scheme. At present the organisations by which inter-Imperial agencies are controlled differ widely from one another, and in a number of cases these do not provide for adequate representation of the participating governments of the Empire.- Owing to the relatively limited personnel available in the United Kingdom for most of the governments of the Dominions it is probable that if these bodies were reorganised separately, the personnel of their managing committees would in many cases consist largely of the same persons. Their maintenance as separate entities might cause unnecessary inconvenience to, and waste of the time of, members of the managing committees, who would require . to attend a series of meetings more or less similar in character instead of attending the much smaUer number of meetings that would be necessary if a measure of consolidation were effected.. It is not suggested that these bodies should be absorbed by a new body, but rather that there should be some co-ordination, and that they should be attached to, or grouped under, it as autonomous or semi-autonomous committees.331. The creation of any inter-Imperial body for co-operative effort would imply the establishment of a common fund placed at its disposal to finance the activities that come within its ambit.. No one would suggest that this fund should take the form of a lump sum to be expended more or less at the body&apos;s discretion. Rather,, the first task of the body would be to prepare estimates of the require-ments of the several activities placed under its control. These estimates would be submitted in similar form to each of the govern-ments represented on the body, whose powers and activities would,, in consequence, be limited by the extent to which supplies were granted for such services by the respective governments. The control by the governments over the activities of the body would therefore be direct and absolute. An organisation so constituted &apos; would be far more appropriate than one having vague powers, a roving commission, and freedom to incur expenditure at its own discretion from the supplies furnished by a lump sum.
332. On such a body the representatives of each government would, moreover, be in a position to obtain, quickly and directly, the advice from experts which we consider so essential and which in previous paragraphs we have suggested might be sought at periodical conferences,333. We have now outlined broadly the two main angles from which the objective of co-operation may be approached, and our task is to decide upon what recommendations in this matter we should submit for the consideration of the governments of the Commonwealth. From the point of view of organisation there is much to be said for a consolidation of existing agencies, but the question of the form which this consolidation should take must in the end be determined, not merely by the merits of the scheme in the abstract, but by reference to the support which it would be likely to secure from the peoples of the Commonwealth.334. The history of efforts to secure economic co-operation within the Empire is a comparatively short one, and since the first attempts were made, experience has shown that while some of the bodies created for this purpose have established themselves and extended their activities, others conceived perhaps on somewhat different lines have failed to draw to themselves that support without which continued existence is ultimately impossible. Indeed, organisation in the field of inter-Imperial economic co-operation has not.yet passed the stage where every decision taken must be regarded as tentative and provisional, and developments of organisation suggested for particular purposes can only be judged by the results they obtain.C. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS ON CONSULTATION AND CO-OPERATION335. In existing circumstances we think that economic consulta-tion and co-operation between the several parts of the Commonwealth can best be achieved by the adoption by the governments of the Empire of the scheme which we now propose to outline.336. Subject to the qualifications made below in regard to the inter-Imperial information bureaux, the services performed by the various existing agencies fall into clearly defined fields, though all have the common object of furthering consultation and co-operation. They are related to one another, therefore, less by the work which they do than by the fact that their inter-Imperial character demands that the controlling body of each should be representative of those members of the Commonwealth that participate in, and contribute to the cost of, their work.337. Our general conclusion is, therefore, that where &quot;the field is clearly defined, as it is for example in the case of the Imperial Shipping
Committee and of the Imperial Communications Advisory Com-mittee, no attempt need be made to secure amalgamation or centralised control.338. Bibliographical and information services, whether they deal with (say) soil science or mycology, are essentially similar in character, and we feel that it would be anomalous if the present arrangement were maintained by which the financial and adminis-trative work of the eight agricultural bureaux is controlled by the Executive Council of the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux while the older bureaux (the Imperial Institute of Entomology and the Imperial Mycological Institute) retained their present independence. To some extent the same considerations apply to the Bureau of Hygiene and Tropical Diseases, though its position can be differentiated by reason of the fact that unlike the others, this bureau is not.concerned with agricultural problems. Our recommendation, therefore, as stated in paragraph 266 above, is that in future the eight Imperial Agricultural Bureaux, the Imperial Institute of Entomology and the Imperial Mycolbgical Institute, should be organically associated with one another by having their finances and administration controlled by a single body. This body should be the present Executive Council of the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux, though as explained in para-graph 258 above, some adjustment should be made to secure numerical equality in representation thereon,339. There remains for us to consider the method by which co-operation should be effected in the field of scientific investigation. This might take several forms. Thus, two or more governments of the Empire might make ad hoc arrangements among themselves for the conduct, in any part of the Empire, of research schemes of mutual interest. On the other hand, specified research projects of wide Empire interest might be conducted on a general co-operative basis and financed from a common fund.340. We have been impressed by the evidence that we have received regarding the importance of much of the research now being conducted-with an inter-Imperial object. In the new cir-cumstances which will arise on the termination of the support hitherto given by the Empire Marketing Fund, the continuance of such work must depend on the support of the various governments interested, and these governments, we consider, should be advised by the responsible administrative heads of the research organisations as to what branches of scientific research are of a type which could advantageously be conducted co-operatively.341. It has been suggested therefore that a conference, repre-sentative of the various parts of the Commonwealth and consisting partly of the responsible administrative and scientific heads of research organisations and departments in those countries and partly of such other persons as the several governments may select, should
be summoned at an early date for the purpose of formulating a pro-gramme of such forms of research as it may be considered should be conducted on an inter-Imperial basis. We welcome this suggestion, and we hope that it will be possible for the several governments of the Empire to appoint representatives to attend the proposed conference. We realise, however, that in the case especially of Australia, New Zealand, and India, there are practical difficulties in this suggestion. Its adoption would involve the absence from their several countries of the leading scientific authorities for a period of several months, and in countries such as Australia and New Zealand where the scientific staffs are necessarily limited in size, this presents a serious administrative problem. While, there-fore, we hope that the proposed conference will be held at an early date, we feel some doubt as to whether it could take place in time to deal with the pressing problems arising from the fact that financial provision by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom for the continuance of the Empire Marketing Board expires at the end of September next. Since the difficulties to which we have referred may make it impossible for the conference to be arranged before that date, we recommend that the Executive Council of the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux should be invited by the governments of the Empire to consider immediately the question of what research activities should, in its opinion, be conducted on a co-operative basis and to prepare a report on this question for presentation to the conference suggested above. If it is not possible for this conference to meet within a brief period after the completion of its report, we recommend it should be presented direct to the governments of the Empire.342. As the result of the recommendations of the proposed conference or of the Executive Council of the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux, we assume that the governments of the Empire will agree that there are certain research activities of general interest which can most effectively and most, economically be conducted on a co-operative basis in the United Kingdom or &quot;other parts of the Commonwealth, their cost being met by subscriptions from such governments as may decide to participate. As regards such schemes as the governments may consider could best be carried out in the United Kingdom, we feel that it would be of advantage if there were some inter-Imperial organisation that could receive the subscriptions from the governments concerned and exercise some general supervision of the work on behalf of those governments. We do not consider that it is necessary to establish a new body for this purpose, but we are of opinion that this duty should be entrusted to the Executive Council of the Bureaux.343. In respect to the initiation of additional proposals for co-operative research in the future, we recognise that the proposed conferences would be the appropriate body to put forward such proposals, but in view of the difficulties of holding such conferences
frequently, we recommend that it should be within the competence of the Executive Council of the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux to submit proposals to governments on this matter. The advantages of this system are that it provides full opportunities for each govern-ment to consider participation, complete freedom to decide whether to participate or not, and every opportunity to review the work done and the results secured.344. Turning to economic as opposed to scientific questions, our view is that consultation and co-operation between the several governments of the Empire could be best effected by the continuance of the Imperial Economic Committee which should, however, in future be financed, as well as constituted, inter-Imperially. Subject to what we say in paragraphs 346 and 347 below, we do not think that any extension of the terms of reference of that committee as defined by the Imperial Conference of 1930 is required.345. In addition to the work hitherto performed by that Committee and the work which we recommend should be performed by the Imperial Shipping Committee, there are certain services in the economic sphere at present carried on by the Empire Marketing Board, which we are of opinion should in future be conducted on an inter-Imperial basis. Those that we recommend should be so con-ducted are the periodical market intelligence notes and world surveys of production and trade (including those at present embraced by the &quot; commodity &quot; series issued by the Empire Marketing Board). The general value to the Empire of these services, in our view, has been established, and we recommend that in future they should be conducted under the supervision of the Imperial Economic Committee, their cost being defrayed from the funds of that Committee which henceforward should be provided by subscriptions received from the governments of the Commonwealth.346. For the purpose of enabling the Imperial Economic Committee to undertake these additional duties, we recommend that in paragraph 3 of the terms of reference the words &quot; to prepare, at the instance of the governments of the Empire, preliminary surveys . . . ..&quot; should be amended to read &quot; to prepare on obtaining the approval of the governments . . . .&quot;.347. We recommend also that it should be within the competence of the Imperial Economic Committee to make proposals to govern-ments in regard to other economic services and inquiries which, in its view, should be conducted on a co-operative basis ; and that to enable the Committee to do so, its terms of reference should be enlarged by the addition of the following sub-head authorising it : &quot; to make proposals to governments in regard to other economic &quot; services and inquiries which in its view should be conducted on &quot; a co-operative basis, it being understood that this does not &quot; give to the Committee any power to initiate proposals regard-&quot; ing consultation in respect of economic policy.&quot;
348. For some services which we have recommended should in future be conducted inter-Imperially, namely, the scientific information bureaux services, there already exist bases of allocation of subscriptions as between the United Kingdom, the Dominions, India, Southern Rhodesia, and the Colonial Empire. With the exception of the Executive Council of the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux, for the expenses of which a definite scale of contribution was worked out at the outset for a five-year period, subscriptions to these bodies in the scientific field do not appear for the most part to be based on any theoretical consideration either of benefit received or of capacity to pay. The result is not altogether satis-factory, but has the advantage that it commands the support of the participating governments, and we do not recommend that at the present time any attempt should be made to re-assess the basis of allocation. We hope, however, that those governments that .have reduced, or temporarily withdrawn, their contributions to the Imperial Institute of Entomology and the Imperial Mycological Institute will feel able to restore their contributions to the former basis.349. It is necessary for us now to consider on what basis the governments of the Empire should contribute to those services, scientific and economic, at present conducted by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, which we recommend should in future be conducted on a co-operative basis.350. As regards such scientific research as it may later be decided should be undertaken in the interests of the Commonwealth or of a number of its parts, we do not feel that it is possible to suggest any scale of contribution until the amount to be expended on such research has been determined. We therefore recommend that the basis of contribution towards the cost of agreed scientific research projects should be fixed by the governments of the Empire at the time when, in the light of the report either of the proposed conference or of the Executive Council of the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux, they decide what research services should in future be so conducted.351. Before we pass from the consideration of scientific research, there are two matters on which we think it convenient to give our view. In the first place, as regards such research as the govern-ments may agree should be undertaken co-operatively and which is now being financed by the Empire Marketing Board, we recommend that they should agree that such contributions as they may decide to make should commence on 1st October, 1933, the day after the expiry of the present financial provision for the Empire Marketing Board. We hope that it may be possible for this to apply both to such schemes as it may be agreed before 30th September next should be so continued, and also to those on which agreement may be reached in the period immediately following that date.
As regards schemes for which at the end of September next there appear reasonable grounds for hoping that agreement will be secured for their continuance on a co-operative basis, we have received with great satisfaction an assurance by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom that they will be prepared to continue such services for a brief period to enable such discussions to be brought to a conclusion.352. There is one other matter in relation to the research grants of the Empire Marketing Board to which we desire to refer, namely the position which will arise after September next in regard to the absolute commitments entered into by the Board. We understand that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, who take full responsibility for these particular commitments, will take the initiative in approaching each of the governments of the Common-wealth in regard to grants to institutions in their countries.353. We come now to the question of the basis of allocation to be adopted in regard to the sum required to cover the remaining services which we recommend should in future be conducted on a co-operative basis. These are the services at present conducted by the Imperial Economic and Imperial Shipping Committees and the market intelligence and trade survey services at present carried on by the Empire Marketing Board which we have recommended should be transferred to the first-named Committee. In addition, the enlargement of the functions of the Executive Council of the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux that we have recommended will necessitate some increase in its headquarters expenditure which at present is exceptionally small in relation to the expenditure controlled.354. We are now in a position to give the following summary of the services which we definitely recommend should in future be financed co-operatively by the several governments of the Empire : Imperial Economic Committee   Present cost of Imperial Economic Committee  .. 5,160Periodical market intelligence services (including 10,720 library).World surveys and commodities series    ..       .. 4,320 20,200Imperial Shipping Committee ..       ..       ..        2,000Executive Council of the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux  Additional contribution for headquarters..       .. 1,800 24,000355. We have discussed fully amongst ourselves how the above sum should be allocated as between the several parts of the Empire. After considering the statistics of general trade exports from each
part of the Empire to other parts of the Empire, the agricultural production of each part of the. Empire, and the benefits likely to be received, we recommend the adoption of the following scale which involves the contributions shown below : 	Units of .		contribution.

We recommend that the governments of the Empire should agree to contribute to the above services on the basis&apos;set out in paragraph 355 above as from 1st October, 1933.357. Such then in broad outline are our recommendations as to the methods for inter-Imperial consultation and co-operation to be adopted in the period before us. Both on the scientific and the economic side, certain work should, we propose, be consolidated, while other work should continue to be conducted by existing agencies. These recommendations will, we believe, serve to set the field for the development within the Empire of consultation and co-operation conceived on a basis of equality and conducted in the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole.
SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL RECOMMENDATIONS858. We summarise our principal recommendations as follows : (a) SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION SERVICES AND RESEARCH ACTIVITIES(1) We recommend that the Executive Council of the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux should be entrusted with the supervision of: (a) the administration and financial control of the eight Imperial Agricultural Bureaux ;(b) the administration and finances of the Imperial Institute of Entomology, and the Imperial Mycological Institute ;(Note. We recommend that, should it be so desired, there should be constituted also in respect of each of these Institutes a scientific advisory committee to assist the Director on scientific, as opposed to administrative and financial, questions.)(c) such research activities in the United Kingdom as the participating governments may agree should in future be conducted on a co-operative basis.(2) We recommend that the question of what research activities should in future be carried out co-operatively should be considered at a conference to be summoned as early as possible, consisting partly of the administrative and scientific heads of national research organisa-tions and departments, and partly of such other persons as the several governments may select. We recognise, however, that there sire difficulties in the way of the meeting of such a conference in the immediate future and we accordingly recommend that the Executive Council of the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux should be invited by the governments of the Commonwealth to consider immediately the question of the research activities which should, in its opinion, be conducted on a co-operative basis and to prepare a report for presenta-tion to the conference referred to above. If it is not possible for that conference to meet within a brief period of the completion of its report, we recommend that it should be presented direct to the governments of the Empire.(3) We recognise that conferences of the type proposed would be the appropriate body to initiate additional proposals for co-operative action in regard to scientific research, but owing to the difficulties of holding such conferences frequently, we recommend that it should be within the competence of the Executive Council of the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux from time to time to submit proposals on this matter.
(b) ECONOMIC INTELLIGENCE AND INQUIRY (4) We recommend : (a) that the Imperial Economic Committee should continue to discharge its existing functions ;(b) that that Committee should undertake the following services which should be transferred to it from the Empire Marketing Board : (i) periodical market intelligence notes ;(ii) world surveys of production and trade (including those at present embraced by the &quot; commodity &quot; series issued by the Empire Marketing Board);(c) that it should be within the competence of the Committee to make proposals to governments in regard to other economic services and mquiries which, in its view, should be conducted on a co-operative basis;(d) that to enable the Committee to discharge these functions its terms of reference should be extended as follows :(i) In paragraph 3 of the terms of reference, the words &quot; to prepare, at the instance of the governments of the Empire, preliminary surveys . . . . &quot; should be amended to read &quot;to prepare on obtaining the approval of the governments...&quot;(ii) There should be added the following subhead authorising the Committee : &quot; to make proposals to governments in regard to other economic services and inquiries which in its view should be conducted on a co-operative basis, it being understood that this does not give to the Committee any power to initiate proposals regarding consultation in respect of economic policy.&quot;(5) We recommend that the Imperial Shipping Committee should remain a separate Later-Imperial organisation.(6) We recommend that as from 1st October, 1938, the cost of the services which we propose should in future be conducted by the Imperial Economic Committee and by the Imperial Shipping Com-mittee should be met from a fund to which the several governments of the Commonwealth should subscribe, and that at the outset from
tiais fund should also be met the cost of such additions to the head-quarters expenditure of the Executive Council of the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux as may result from the adoption of our recom-mendations in (1) above.(7) We recommend that the fund proposed in (6) above should be constituted on the following lines : IMPERIAL ECONOMIC COMMITTEE. Present cost of Imperial Economic Committee .. 5,160 Periodical market intelligence services (includinglibrary)     ............      10,720World surveys and commodities series     ..      ..       4,320 20,200IMPERIAL SHIPPING COMMITTEE      ..      ..        2,000EXECUTIVE COUNCIL OP THE IMPERIAL AGRICULTURAL BUREAUX. Additional contribution for headquarters  ..      ..       1,800 24,000(8) We recommend that the several governments should agree to contribute to the above services for a period of three years in the first instance as from 1st October, 1933. After considering the statistics of general trade exports from each part of the Empire to other parts of the Empire, the agricultural production of each part of the Empire, and the benefits likely to be received, we recommend the adoption of the following scale which involves the contributions shown below : Units of Contri-contribution.    button. United Kingdom and the Colonial		Empire	35	8,400Canada	16	3,840Australia	14	3,360India	12	2,880Union of South Africa       ..      ...	8	1,920New Zealand	8	1,920Irish Free State	4	960Southern Rhodesia	2	480Newfoundland       ......	1	240
(e) GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS IN REGARD TO TEE ORGANISATION OF AGENCIES FOR INTER-IMPERIAL CONSULTATION AND CO-OPERATION(9) We recommend that the following principles should be observed in regard to the organisation of agencies for inter-Imperial consultation and co-operation : (a) The complete constitutional equality of the participating governments should be recognised in the method of appointment to, and composition and organisation of, each agency.(b) The formal instrument appointing persons as members of inter-Imperial agencies should be issued by each government concerned.(c) Adequate financial provision should be forthcoming. This implies not only, sufficient funds but also a reasonable certainty of income over a definite period of years.(d) At the same time, there should be careful and periodical examination of the various institutions at Empire conferences suitable for the purpose as without this assurance, governments could hardly be expected to provide financial support as visualised in (c) above.(e) The managing bodies of inter-Imperial agencies should in no way be subject to financial control by the Finance Department of any one government of the Commonwealth, but over and above regular scrutiny by a suitably constituted finance committee, they should be free to take advantage of the experience of sucli departments.(f) Each inter-Imperial agency should approach the participat-ing governments directly through the appropriate channel.We anticipate that such communications would normally take one or other of two main forms. On formal questions, such as the presentation of estimates, communications would be addressed by the secretary of the agency concerned to the governments concerned. In the case of the Dominions, India, and Southern Rhodesia this would be through the High Commissioner or other official principal representative of those governments in London, and in the case of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Colonial Empire it would be through the appropriate Minister. On more important questions of policy we assume that the representatives on the agency concerned would themselves take steps to obtain the views of their respective governments.
(g) As a general rule to which, however, exceptions may at times be necessary, Imperial organisations should serve only those members of the Commonwealth that subscribe to their funds or pay for such services on a fee basis.(Signed)    O.

STATEMENT 5 The Empire Marketing BoardFinancial position for second six months of the year 1933-4The total Empire Marketing Board Vote for 1933-4, of which particulars are given in an annex to-this note, amounts (if &quot; National Mark &quot; publicity, which is irrelevant, is omitted) to  201,440A imbalance from 1932       ..       ..       55,560 (provisional) 257,0002. This provision, however, is divided into two portions, viz : (1) Empire Marketing Board money, proper, i.e., the provision promised by the United Kingdom Government at Ottawa for the first six months only,  178,000, i.e.,Administration and direct services* Research . .       . .PublicityTotal        ......       . .       . .     177,720and (2) Treasury money, i.e., money additional to that promised at Ottawa which was paid for convenience into the Empire Marketing Board Vote in order to avoid four Supplementary Estimates later, amounting in all to  79,000, to cover (a) staff etc., expenditure of the Empire Marketing Board in the second six months of the year (while clearing up expiring schemes, poster frames, etc.) and (6) any grant items which might survive the death of the Empire Marketing Board. This last sum was not allocated in detail save so far as provisional allocation as between certain United Kingdom depart-ments was necessary to avoid Supplementary Estimates on other Votes : the sums so allocated were :  English and Scottish Agriculture Votes . . . . 43,729 Department of Scientific and Industrial Research . .       15,800 59,529Of the Treasury money provided, there therefore remains  19,191 for staff etc. and unallocated grant items. If the staff retained for winding up were retained for the whole of the second six months it would cost  13,382 including rent, etc., as well. This w-ould leave only  5,809 for research grants and other expenditure in the second six months.* Direct services include economic investigation, market intelligence and market promotion.26,500 128,670 22,550

APPENDIX 3The financial and administrative organisation of the Imperial War Graves CommissionSummary of the principal points in the evidence submitted by the Vice-Chairman of the commission i - introductory. The Imperial War Graves Commission has been in existence for the past fourteen years. Proposals for its formation were considered by the Imperial War Conference of 1917, which had before it a draft charter of incorporation. This was examined clause by clause by the Conference, which submitted an unanimous recommendation that the Commission should be established and should be granted a charter in the terms approved by the Conference. There-after the necessary formal steps were taken, and the Commission came into existence.2. The view has always been held that the charter could only be amended on the recommendation of an Imperial Conference, and whenever an amend-menthas been found necessary, this procedure has been followed, proposed supplemental charters being submitted to the Imperial Conference: for their approval.     &apos;3. The success which has attended the work of the Commission is largely attributable to the constitution laid down for the Commission in its charter. This was the work of a number of distinguished Dominion statesmen and in the United Kingdom of Lord Milner, Lord Derby and other Ministers. The special value of the Commission^ constitution lies in the inclusion in it of two features which had not been tried previously, in conjunction, in any organisa-tion designed for Imperial co-operation. These were the methods adopted for the control of its finances, and the appointment to the council of a number of persons not directly the representatives of governments.II.-CONTROL OF EXPENDITURE4. The feature which distinguishes the Commission from any other inter-Imperial body in existence at the time of its appointment is that its expendi-ture is not subject to control by any United Kingdom department. The Commission have always attached great importance to freedom from inter-ference in this respect. They have realised, however, that the funds at their disposal are public monies provided by the peoples of the several parts of the Empire, and that each government has its own financial machinery of which advantage should be taken as far as possible. In connection with this, the Commission have invited the attendance at their Finance Committee, by which they are advised on all financial questions, of a representative of the United Kingdom Treasury. Great assistance has been received from that officer, who, however, attends only in an advisory capacity. He is not actually a member of the Committee, and he has no vote. The Finance Committee is a very strong one, and includes Dominion representatives. At first it met fortnightly, and it now meets monthly. It has active control and super-vision over all the expenditure of the Commission.5. The charter provides that the accounts of the Commission should be audited by a firm of chartered accountants nominated by the Governor of the Bank of England for the time being. The accounts so audited are attached to the Commission^ annual report, and are communicated to the governments
of the several parts of the Empire. They are further open to the inspection of the government auditors of all the participating governments. So far, the United Kingdom.-Comptroller and Auditor General has alone taken advan-tage of this arrangement. Again they have so far only been scrutinised by the Public Accounts Committee of the United Kingdom, though they are open to scrutiny by similar bodies in other parts of the Empire. From the point of view of avoiding criticism overseas the witness felt that it is probably more advantageous that the accounts should be audited by an outside firm of accountants rather than that they should be audited by the United Kingdom. Comptroller and Auditor General, even if he merely acted at the request of the Commission itself.6. The United Kingdom subscription to the Imperial War Graves Corn-mission is provided on the Civil Estimates of the United Kingdom and the Chairman who is the Secretary of State for &quot;War would answer any question that might arise in the United Kingdom Parliament.7. The Commission attach importance to the fact that in the government of each of the subscribing parts of the Empire there is a Minister especially responsible to his parliament for that Dominions share in the work of the Commission.S. Over 80 per cent, of the total expenditure of the Commission is met from sums provided by the United Kingdom Parliament. As the United Kingdom Government had been willing to forego normal financial control of the expenditure of the Commission, it might in the opinion of the witness reasonably be inferred that they would take the same attitude if some inter-Imperial body were established to the funds of which the United Kingdom Government did not subscribe so large a proportion. If the Dominion and other oversea governments subscriptions to such a body represented a higher percentage than they do in the case of the Imperial War Graves Commission, it would be of advantage that the Dominion governments should be given some further means of satisfying themselves in regard to financial control. This might be done either by associating some nominee of wide business experience acceptable to the Dominions governments with the proposed body or with its Finance Committee in the same way as a representative of the United Kingdom. Treasury is associated with the Finance Committee of the Imperial War Graves Commission or by the Dominions if they had (say) two seats on such a body, appointing as their nominee to one of these seats, a person with financial or other non-governmental experience.III.-THE NON-OFFICIAL ELEMENT OF THE COMMISSION9. The charter prescribes (clause 3, section 3) that in addition to the official members, the Commission should include such other persons, not exceeding eight in all, as may from time to time be appointed by Royal Warrant. These persons have been of the greatest assistance to the Corn-mission by bringing to it their experience in various fields of activity (com-mercial, industrial, financial, etc.) which would not have been represented if the personnel of the Commission had been purely advisory in character. These non-official persons are selected for then special personal qualifications, the object being that the group of non-official members taken as a whole should be representative of forms of experience of value to the Commission in its work.10. When vacancies arise among the non-official members the subject is fully discussed by the Commission itself which finally agrees upon a name to be submitted through the normal channel to His Majesty for approval. It is of course open to any Dominion representative on the Commission to refer to his government for instructions when such questions as the filling of a vacancy on the Commission are under consideration.
IV.-METHOD OF COMMUNICATION AND OTHER CONTACTS WITH DOMINION GOVERNMENTS11. When any question arises requiring the opinion or consent of a Dominion government that governments representative on the Commission communi-cates with his government direct if he is a High Commissioner, otherwise through his High Commissioner. No difficulty has been found in this method of communication. The Commission does not for any purpose correspond with the governments of the Empire through the United Kingdom Dominions Office. Further contacts with the Dominions have been effected by visits paid by the Vice-Chairman. The staff of the Commission is also inter-Imperial, being drawn from the various Dominions, India, etc. in proportion to their subscriptions to the Commission.
