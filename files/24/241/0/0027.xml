THIS DOCUMENT IS TH&apos;&quot; PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; SGOVERNMENT.EGRET. .P.147(33).Copy No.0 A B I N E T.INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE, GENEVA.Seventeenth Session,  June,  1933.Proposed Instructions to the British Government Delegates.Memorandum hy the Minister of Labour.The Seventeenth Session of the International LabourConference will open at Geneva on Thursday,  8th June,  1933.I circulate herewith a brief note on each of the five items on the Agenda,  embodying proposed Instructions to the British Government Delegates as to the line they are to take as regards each of these subjects.      These have been drawn up by&quot;my Department where it is the one mainly concerned, and by the Home Office and the Ministry of Health where the matter appertains to them.      The general line of these instructions has also been approved by the International Labour Committee, upon which all the Departments concerned are represented.Subject to any observations which my colleagues may wish to make, the Delegates will be instructed accordingly.It is possible that a difficulty may arise at the Conference in connection with the credentials of the German Workers&apos; Delegate,  and possibly Advisers.     My Department are in con-sultation, with the Foreign Office who are obtaining information as to the probable attitude of some of the other principal countries.      As it is uncertain whether,  and in what form,  the issue will arise at the Conference, I do not at present ask for the authority of the Cabinet for any particular line of action. I may have to ask for an urgent decision but I propose to wait for the information which the Foreign Office are endeavouring to obtain and for the developments at the Conference itself.      I shall of course act in the closest consultation with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,(Intld.)H. B.29th May,  1933.
INTERNATIONAL    LABOUR_CONF^REPCE.Seventeenth- Session.Instructions to the Government Delegates.1.      Abolition of Fee-Charging Smployment Agencies.This question was on the Agenda of last yearfe Conference for its first reading, when a questionnaire was drawn up for circulation to Governments.H.M.Government replied to the questionnaire to the effect that they are opposed to abolition which would tend to create hardship and public inconvenience,    but are in favour ef a policy of gradual development of national Employment Exchanges to provide such services as are required by the public the reply added that H.M.Government rely on Local Authorities to obviate the possibility of abuse under the powers which they may exercise in accordance with existing legislation or in pursuance of private Acts.It is suggested that at the forthcoming Conference the representatives of K. M.Government,    if called upon to express their views,    should state that H.M.  Government would be prepared to vote for the Convention if its terms do not go further than to provide for the regulation of fee charging agencies,  the precise method of regulation being left to each country concerned. Should, however,  the terms of the draft Convention provide either for the total abolition, of these agencies,  or,  alternatively for their regulation by methods prescribed in the Convention itself,  in a manner which conflicts with our existing system, H.M.  Government would be compelled to vote against its adoption. 2o      Invalidity, Old Age, axid Widows&apos;  and Orphans&apos;  Insurance.This question,  also, was on the Agenda of the Conference last year when arrangements were made for a questionnaire to be circulated to Governments.      H.M.  Government replied to this questionnaire in considerable detail.      The business before the forthcoming Conference will be to decide upon a Convention or Conventions.
Ci A 6,      4.U 0In view of the extensive development of social insurance in this country, and the heavy charges incurred thereunder,    ELM.  Government considers it desirable that international regulations should he adopted regarding invalidity,  old ege and widows&apos;  and orphans1  insurance so that other countries may he stimulated to make corresponding advances in this sphere.      The Delegates are accordingly instructed,  subject to the undermentioned reservations,  to endeavour to secure the adoption of Conventions on these matters.The Delegates will be careful to refrain from committing H.M. Government to the acceptance of any provision in a Draft Convention or Draft Recommendation which would involve the laying down or support of any fundamental principle which is inconsistent with the British Schemes, and they will endeavour to secure the omission of any such provision, or its amendment to a form that will not be in conflict with the British Schemes.The Delegates will oppose the adoption of any Convention which embodies the general principle that a non-contributory Scheme can be accepted as a substitute for a contributory Scheme, but the opposition should not be carried to the point of imperilling the Convention, if the authorisation can be limited to the Schemes of those countries which, having no contributory Schemes, have already adopted non-contributory Schemes which provide reasonable protection for their workers.o
i? dSince under the British Scheme all widows of insured men who satisfy the statutory insurance conditions are entitled to pensions, the Delegates will oppose any Convention which authorises the restriction of title to such pensions to widows who are either invalid or over a certain age.The Delegates will oppose:-(a) any provision which would involve an extension of tie scope of the British Schemes;(b) any proposal to lower the age for the receipt of an old age pension below 65, and any recommendation which would suggest that H.M. Government is prepared to consider a reduction of that age, whether generally or for particular occupations;(c) any proposal to make the qualifying conditions for the award of old age or widows&apos; and orphans&apos;  pensions so rigid as to preclude adjustment of the British statutory conditions should II, LI. Government deem this necessary following the consideration of the statutory report in 1935 by the Govern-ment Actuary on the financial working of the contributory pensions Scheme;(d) any proposition that an invalidity pension (which in the British Scheme is represented by disablement benefit) should be paid for partial incapacity;(e) any proposition that medical benefit or treatment should be provided for persons other than those who are insured for invalidity pensions and whose restoration to health would effect a saving to insurance funds;(f) any proposition that a specified proportion of the cost of a scheme should be borne by the State;(g) any proposition that funeral benefits should be embodied in a Scheme.(h) any proposition which would involve the participation of Approved societies or other outside bodies in the award of old age or widows&apos;  and orphans&apos;  pensions, management of funds, etc.
The Delegates will endeavour to  secure that all Schemes are subject.to proper Government control and that a full disclosure of the actual working of the Schemes is made at periodic intervals.3.      Unemployment Insurance and Various Forms of Relief for the Unemployed.This question is upon the Agenda of the International Labour Conference for the first time,  and under the normal double read-ing procedure the business before the Conference this year will be to arrange for the circulation of a questionnaire to Govern-ments,  on which action next year can be based.The Delegates will endeavour to limit the discussion tosettling the terms of the questions to be put to the Governments,-and to securing that the questions are such as to enable a full statement of practice and policy to be made in reply to the questionnaire, with a view to the framing of a satisfactory Convention at a later stage.4.      Hethods of Providing Rest and Alternation of  Shifts in Automatic Sheet-Glass Works.&apos;This question is  also upon the Agenda for the first time so that the procedure in regard to it will be the same as that regarding Unemployment Insurance mentioned above.The delegates will endeavour to secure that the points on which Governments are to be consulted should be sufficiently comprehensive to obtain all the information as to the conditions in the different countries necessary to the preparation of a practicable Convention.    They will avoid,  so far as possible, expressing views on questions of policy during this year&apos;a discussion.A suggested item in the Questionnaire as to extra pay for Sunday,  public holio.ay and night work may be regarded as outside the.scope of the agenda,  on the basis that extra pay is not a method of providing rest or alternation of shifts,  though it may in some cases be incidental to work at inconvenient times,    ilore-over,  the importation of this question would complicate the
issues and perhaps prove a stumbling block to agreement on a draft Convention.    Nevertheless,  the delegates need not suggest the exclusion of this question unless  it is clear that there would be considerable support for its exclusion, but should endeavour to secure that the point is only put to the Governments in a general way, e.g.  as to whether extra pay should be provided for,  and if so whether for work on Sundays,  on holidays or at night.5.      The Reduction of Sours of Work.Various discussions of the subject of the Reduction of Hours of Work as a possible means of alleviating unemployment resulted in the subject being referred to a Tripartite Preparatory Technical Conference which met last January.    At that Conference a decision was taken to aim at an International Labour Convention on the subject and the main outlines of a draft convention were the subject of resolutions.     The British Government&apos;s position was defined as follows:-/&quot;The British Government Delegate stated that his Government considered that the question of the compulsory limitation of hours of work to 40 a week had not yet been sufficiently examined to warrant a definite conclusion being reached, and that therefore his Government were opposed to proceeding at the present time with the project of a draft Convention.    He pressed for a comprehensive enquiry into the whole question before any definite action was taken.&quot;The Workers&apos;  Group were in favour of a Convention, and the Employers&apos;  Group as a whole were opposed to one,  and did not take any effective part in the discussions on the outlines of a Convention.The Government Body decided to place the subject on the Agenda of the International Labour Conference,  1935, and instructed the Office to prepare both a draft Convention for discussion and also a list of points upon which a questionnaire could be based asking Governments for information, if the Conference so decided.
2.12It is now for the -Conference to decide whether to adopt a draft Convention at once or to draw up a questionnaire to he put to Governments with a view to action at the Conference in 1S34.The j minister of Labour has discussed with representatives of the Trades Union Congress General Council and the rational Confederation of Employers&apos;  Organisations the question of the 40 hour week in association with the general subject of the absorption of workers into employment.    The Trades Union Congress had already initiated an enquiry among their affiliated Unions as to the effects of the 40 hour week on their agreements, and the National Confederation have now issued a questionnaire to employers1 organisations on the subject of the 40 hour week,   the results of which are not likely to be available until after the Conference.It is obviously necessary -that all the facts relative to the subject of the 40 hour week shall be ascertained and examined, and it is proposed,  therefore,  that the British Governments representative should oppose the framing and adoption of a Conven-tion at this Conference on the ground that insufficient information is available.        It seems, however,  impossible to oppose the formulation of a questionnaire for the further consideration of the matter next year.        If,  therefore,  the Conference decides in favour of an immediate Convention,  it is proposed that the delegates should take no further part in the proceedings.    If, however, a decision is taken to frame a questionnaire,  the delegates should co-operate in that action.    It is suggested also that the British Delegate should indicate the impracticability of separating hours and wages in connection with the regulation of the former,  an attitude which we have reason to believe other important countries will support.
