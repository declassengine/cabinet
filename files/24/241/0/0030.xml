&apos; THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.9 9f5 nIt is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.ORE To.  150(55).COPY NO.d4Q0 A B I NET.THE DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE - POLICY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM DELEGATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The situation at Geneva has developed during the last few days into an exceedingly critical one, calling for &apos; immediate consideration by the Cabinet.I learn from Mr. Eden to-day (Telegram No. 283) that the second reading of Parts I and II of the Draft Convention will be taken towards the end of the week, Mr. Henderson&apos;s hope being to complete this second reading by June 11th. Voting will be taken on every issue where there is divergence of view j and Mr. Eden asks for immediate instructions on four matters of high political importance.C1)    Supervision.    In his telegram No. 265 of May 26th Mr. Eden reported a conversation with Mr. Norman Davis making it plain that the chances of a successful Disarmament Conven-tion emerging will be greatly prejudiced unless a satisfactory form of supervision can be agreed upon.       Mr. Davis in his speech to the General Commission on the 22nd May committed his Government to the &quot;belief that a system of adequate supervision should be formulated&quot; and declared &quot;we are heartily in sympathy with the idea that means of effective,  automatic and
9 9 Q   Icontinuous supervision should &quot;be found&quot;.     Mr. Eden points out that the French will want a more stringent form of control than is contemplated in our draft Convention and that they have been encouraged in this  by President Roosevelt&apos;s declaration.      It is of course vital to discover at once from the French how far it would be necessary to go to satisfy thems but the key of the problem appears to be agreement on the establishment of regular routine inspections of armament.      It may be maintained that this would be a considerably greater commitment than that contemplated in our Draft Convention which provided merely that the Permanent Disarmament commission by a large major-ity could authorise such inspections when it had formally been requested.      In practice however it may he that the routine inspections envisaged might actually prove   less onerous and more formal.   What I want is authority from my colleagues that this proposal should be examined by us along with the French,, Americans and others without  *rejudice.  It would of course be impossible to agree without Cabinet sonfirmation0(2)    Tanks.   Mr. Eden&apos; s telegram No. 268 reports on his conversation with the German delegate at Geneva.    All Delegations have now been called on to  state the figures they desire under Article 2i? Tanks.     It is therefore not possible to delay any longer a statement of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s requirements in regard to numbers of tanks. It being theIt is difficult to suppose that the Americans really contemplate being inspected by Europeans and the upshot may be a system of regional reciprocal^ inspections in which case we might claim, special treatment.
*        intention of our Draft Convention to retain tanks of 16 tons, under the principle of equality of treatment as set. out in the /hito Paper of the 17th November,  1932, Germany is logically entitled to possess some.    The word &quot;samples&quot; is commonly employed in this connection.    I &quot;must not disguise from my colleagues that any such proposal will meet with strong wM0opposition from the French and a degree of opposition I am not at present able to estimate from the Americans.    It will almost certainly be less than that of the French.    TheItalians an the other hand would agree to it.    There is also the difficulty that such an admission may be quoted against the National Government by critics who will argue that it is incompatible with the Prime Minister&apos;s statement that no re-armament was to be permitted.    On both these numerical points Mr. Eden urgently needs an immediate decision.    I must add that I do not think there is much prospect of Germany agreeing to any convention which does not give her some satisfaction in this respect.(3)    Air.    Mr. Eden&apos;s telegram Nos  282 reports that he has held conversations with certain other Delegations and as the result he puts up for consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Govermment the formula therein contained.    This formula as it stands appears to me to go beyond what was accepted by the Cabinet for inclusion in Article 35 of the Draft Disarmament Convention, But if it is universally accepted it may be  difficult for us to stand out altogether against any change of wording.    I there-fore suggest that in order to retain the  appearance of the formula as far as possible, but to bring it into exact agree-ment with the gist of Article 35 we might In the last resortagree that it should runs-&quot;The High Contracting Parties accept from now the principle &quot;of total abolition of military and naval aviation sub j e c t to the effective supervision of civil aviation to prevent its misuse for military purposes.    The Permanent Disarmament Commission&apos; shall immediately devote itself to the working out
of the &quot;best possible scheme with this in view.&apos;!I must again ask for an immediate authorisation on this point.(4) No resort to force declaration.      Mr. Eden&apos;s telegram No.  273 shows that the no resort to force declaration suggested originally by His Majesty&apos;s Government for acceptance by all European States will come immediately before the General Commission in the form of a first article of Chapter I of the European Pact prepared by the Security Committee.      Mr. Eden points out that a demand is sure to be made for extension of this declaration to all States including those outside Europe.      He further calls attention to the passage of President Roosevelt&apos; s message which ran as follows:-&quot;I propose that all nations of the world should enter &quot;into a solemn and definite pact of &quot;non-aggression;    that :&apos;they should solemnly reaffirm the obligations they have &quot;assumed to limit and reduce their armaments, and, &quot;provided that these obligations are faithfully executed &quot;by all the signatory Powers,  individually agree that they &quot;will send no armed force of whatsoever nature across &quot;their frontiers&quot;.As phrased, this is an absurd proposition and would properly involve the consequence that the American navy should never put to sea.      The meaning, however, is that no one should &quot;invade his neighbours&quot;.      A more reasonably phrased proposition would be that suggested by the Political Commission - forbidding  resort to      force in the circum-cumstances in which the Pact of Paris forbids resort to war, i.e.   &quot;as an instrument of national policy&quot;.
IB41? ^) 4(4 t)lMr. Eden suggests that there will he great difficulty -in view of this in our opposing the extension of the no-force declaration to non-European States,.    On the other hand, it will he remembered that on the 17th February the Minis-terial Committee, having discussed the possibility of the extension of this declaration, beyond Europe, agreed &quot;that the &quot;declaration of no resort to force was meant specifically to &quot;apply to Europe and had been framed with a particular end &apos;in view and to extend its application universally would be &quot;to destroy the entire usefulness of this pact and any &quot;attempt to do so should be strongly resisted by us&quot;, (D.C.(M)(32) 8th Conclusions),      It was further agreed on 5th March to omit Section II containing the Declaration of Non-Resort to Force from the Draft Convention on the grounds that it was not applicable and should form a separate document by itself,It is clear to me that in view of our world-wide responsibilities it would be extremely difficult for us to accept any general restriction of the kind contemplated without making it impossible effectively to protect the territories under our control.      But I should be very glad of my colleagues&apos; advice as to what line of argument should be publicly adopted in such a way as not to subject His Majesty&apos;s Government to most unpleasant criticism and to produce a sense of divergence between our public policy and that formulated by ^resident Roosevelt.(Intld.)

His Majesty&apos;s Consul (Geneva),May 30th,  1933.D. 11.00 a.m. May 30th,  1933.Ro 11.45 a.m. May 30th,  1933.No.  283.xxxxxxxxxFollowing from Mr. Eden.Present intention is to begin second reading of parts 1 and 2 of draft Convention towards the end of the week.      Mr.  Henderson&apos;s hope is to complete this second reading by about June 11th.      Voting will be taken on every issue where there is a divergence of view.It is clearly desirable thatwe should regulate as many as possible of important points discussed with other Great Powers before votes are taken.      The next -ten days will therefore be the most crucial of the Conference and I much hope that it will be possible for you or for some other Cabinet Minister to be here for them.      You will appreciate that there is not only the difficult task of seeking to promote agreemea t amongst other Powers upon our drafts but also that of maintaining the lead we have hitherto held, which must present formidable difficulties.      Decisions will have to be taken at short notice upon a wide variety of issues and upon these will depend position in which we shall find ourselves at the finish.
Decypher.      His Majesty1s Consul.  (Geneva).May 26th,  1953,Do    7.50 p.m. May 26th,  1933.R.    9.45 p.m. May 26th,  1933.No.  265.LN.------oOo-------Following from Mr. Eden:Norman Davis sent for me today and we had a long conversation as to the future of this conference.      The. present intention is to adjourn on June 10th for the economic conference.      Norman Davis suggested that Mr. Henderson&apos;s continual insistence on this date, only gave the oh structionists encouragement in their delaying tactics.      He wondered whether it would he possible either to postpone the date of the economic conference or to continue work while that conference was in session. Mr. Henderson, I believe,  also favours the latter proposal. I replied that I was convinced that postponement of the economic conference was out of the question and that I would myself be opposed to trying to continue work on disarmament conference at Geneva when the principal delegates of most countries would be in London;    the only result must be ineffective waste of time.Norman Davis, I think, agreed with this reasoning and we both concluded that if any results are to be achieved of sufficient significance to assist the economic conference, they must be realised next week.      We both felt that there was just a possibility that we might
&amp; ;$ 4Cq!   isJ1   j*.realise such measure of agreement as would enable the  conference to accept, except for minor amendments, parts 1 and 2 of the British plan, subject to an effective system of control being worked out.      Such results would be sufficiently near to success at least to redeem the conference from failure and it might even be so staged as to afford a good curtain raiser for the London conference.      The Germans have withdrawn the main amendments on part 2.The French will, of course, want a more stringent form of control and they have been encouraged in this by President Roosevelt.      They must he asked to indicate at once what they would require so that we may decide whether it can be given them.A measure of agreement however on the above lines can only be realised in conversations between in the first instance, the Five Great Powers, each of whom would have to be represented by a principal delegate.      These conversations, to be effective should be begun in the course of next week.Norman Davis has several times expressed his conviction that Hitler could be persuaded to come here.

L.N.Following from Mr. Eden.German Delegate spoke to me yesterday on the subject of figures    of tanks.      States represented at the Conference have been asked to put in their figures and he is wondering what to put in.     He referred to declaration of His Majesty&apos;s Government of November last and he observed it was necessary to try to settle once and for all this question of what had been called &quot;rearmament&quot;.     He.would not like to put in a figure without first discussing matter with me.      I should be somewhat embarrassed by such discussion because I am not sure what we should be prepared to accept.     November declaration seemed to contemplate possibility of Germany having some tanks and this is apparently borne out by conclusions of Ministerial Committee on May 5th approved by cabinet May 10th.On the other hand although Italian Government might be prepared to admit that Germany might have &quot;samples&quot; United States Government are at present opposed to it and French Government are extremely unlikely to yield on the subject. Further if we allow Germany &quot;samples&quot; of tanks can we maintain refusal to allow her sample aircraft?     I think we can do so on the ground that our draft convention   contemplates possibility of ultimate total abolition of military aircraft for everyone.I should be very grateful for any suggestions.3.
From SWITZERLAND.Decode.      H,M:,s:. Consul (Geneva).29th May, 1953.D.      8.57 a.m.        30th May. 1933. R.    10.15 a.m.        30th May, 1933. No.   282.L.N.   (E).Following from Mr,    Eden.If conversations are to he initialled this week on the subject of air chapter it is necessary to know what if any modifications we might be read;/- to consider.After conversation with certain other delegates it seems to me that something on the following lines may be proposed to us.&quot;The High Contracting Parties accept from now the principle of total abolition of military and naval aviation in combination with measures of international co-operation in respect of civil aviation to prevent its use for military purposes.      The Permanent Disarmament Commission is charged with preparation of a convention to realise this principle with a view to an air disarmament conference which shall take place not later than 1956.&quot;I should be glad to learn whether His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would be able to agree on anything on the above lines.
FROM SWITZERLAND.Decypher.His Majesty&apos;s Consul (Geneva).27th May, 193 3.D.7.22 p.m.    27th May, 1933.R.8.45 p.m.27th May, 1933.No.  273  (L/N).Following from Mr. Men:&quot;No resort to force&quot; declaration constitutes   first Article of Chapter one of European pact prepared by Security Committee which will come before the General Commission in a day or two.      I  anticipate that demand will then be made that discussion on possible extension of declaration to the whole world which it was agreed should take place during the Conference should be entered on at once.      In view of our acceptance of President roosevelt&apos;s declaration I suppose we can no longer oppose such exten-sion.      In any event I will try to induce United States delegate to speak before me and will take the same line as he in this matter.
e) O) g &apos;Decypher. His Majesty&apos;s Consul (Geneva)May 27th,  1933.D. 8035 p.m.      May 27th9  1933.R. 9.35 pom.      May 27ths  1933.Nos &quot;275. L.N.  -Immediate.Following from Mr. Eden.The Air Chapter of our draft convention was dis-cussed today and had a had reception&apos;    There was an overwhelming expression of opinion in favour of total abolition of military and naval air forces though some delegations would couple this with nationalisation of civil aviation.    Though I did my best to present arguments in our favour our draft as it stands found no support except that M. Boncour expressed a measure of general approval.    Reservation as to police bombing was universally condemned except by Iraqui and Persian delegates.    Latter has proposed amendment limiting reservation to  territories of High Contracting Parties.United States delegate made strong appeal to us to reconsider our position in regard to police bombing.Spanish delegate realised that our procedure didnot admit of taking votes on first reading butsuggested there was obviously so large a concensus ofopinion authors of draft should be asked to&quot;take note of it,  enter into conversations,  and produceamendments to  text for the second  reading.    This Ihad to  accept to do for alternative would have been ademand for an immediate, net e which the President-1-
9 &quot;1 Q ENp (* t) dmight not have heen ahle to resist even supposing he had wished to do so.      Altogether this was most damaging day our draft convention has suffered.Second reading will not come up for some days hut -meanwhile we must he prepared to carry on negotiations referred to above-,        Would it be possible for Secretary of State for Air to come out here early next week to do this,  if possible on Monday?     Matter is important because unless we make earnest attempt to meet the crisis that this portion of our draft has aroused we are in danger of losing the good position we have gained with so much pain and grief.
