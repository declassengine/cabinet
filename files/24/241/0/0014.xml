:J?r;-, ....     &apos; &quot;iPrinted for the Cabinet..  May 1933.MOST. SECRET. &quot;.. . 2JJi Copy NO./ 315CP. 134 (33).TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.    &apos;It is requested that special oare may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.WAR DEBTS.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.THE question of war debts is once more urgent and dangerous, and although the President of the United States of America has done and said nothing decisive, an early decision is of paramount importance to this country.First of all, may I say that although as a creditor country we do not wish to precipitate defaults, we ought not, in my opinion, to allow this risk to dominate our judgment on the problem of American war debts. These debts are not like loans made for State development or railway and harbour construction. Secondly, the influence which restrains Australia, for instance, from default is not the good example of the Mother Country, so much as the fear that if she defaults she will not be able for many a long year to borrow again.Then I would suggest that we should not be frightened by a word. Default and moratorium are ugly words; deferment is not much better and has awkward implications. But to make payment at the expense of our equilibrium and of our recuperative strength is still more dangerous. The ugly words we can survive, but the strain on our country&apos;s heart and strength may prove to be the beginning of a catastrophe.It is because of the urgency of these transactions the Economic Conference opens sixteen days hence and the debt payments are due three days later that I venture to write now. The decision to be taken by us must be reached in less than three weeks.I have tried to put down in concise form some of what seemed to me to be important facts which are most prominently before us when considering the problem.It is not always remembered that the debts over which discussion arises represent by no means the whole of the value of our purchases in the United States during the War. Of a total expenditure amounting to about 12,000 million dollars, the United States Government advances accounted for only about one-third. The other two-thirds were mainly financed by the sale of our securities and our gold, by the export of our goods and by means of market loans which have since been repaid to the extent of over 90 per cent. The transfer of these capital assets during the war, and our post-war payments have reduced permanently the wealth of this country, and have inevitably diminished our capacity to meet our inter-governmental obligations.It is also fair to bear in mind the high prices which we paid for food, materials and munitions bought in the United States in those years; The average wholesale price index in the United States from April 1917 to November 1918. according to the American Bureau of Statistics was 189, whereas the present figure, calculated on the same basis, is under 90. This means that the commodities which cost us in 1917-18 189 dollars can now be bought for 90 dollars, or, in other [8640]
wordsythe slim of money which we&apos; are asked to repay to America represents in commodities more than double the quantity of the original purchase. That is to * say, since payment can really only be made in goods and services, and since each dollar&apos;mm buys more than twice as much as when-the loans were made, the payments under the Agreement to-day have &quot;the same effect as if we were returning for each thousand tons of steel or thousand bales of cotton that We bought, two thousand tons or two thousand bales.: - But this is not the whole story. Our capacity to pay has been greatly reduced by the depreciation of the pound sterling&apos;; whereas in 1917-18, and indeed&apos;until 1931, the pound sterling was capable of buying 4 dollars 86 cents, now/when repayment to America is required, the 4 dollars 86 cents can only be bought by the expenditure of  1 7s. In other words, the difference in price levels involves us in paying twice the original debt, and the fall in the pound multiplies this swollen sum by nearly one-half.   The burden is thus triple the original debt.In the complete picture we shall (if prices remain at their present level) be under the obligation to send back across the Atlantic on capital account 3 tons of steel, &amp;c, for every 1 ton which we received during the &quot;War.But, so far from the United States being ready to receive from us in times of peace three times as many goods as she sent to us during the War, the amount of the goods which she takes from us has been greatly reduced. In 1923, when the Agreement was signed, the War Debt annuity of  33 millions was about half the amount of our exports to the United States of America ( 60 millions); but in 1932 our domestic exports to the United States of America had been reduced to  15 millions, while our current annuity in respect of the War Debt would amount at present exchange rates to some  50 millions; that is, four times as much as the total of our domestic exports to the United States of America altogether!These are arguments for a revision of the figures of indebtedness. But no revision will obviate the world-wide effect of these inter-governmental payments, which are largely responsible for the sense of financial insecurity and for the lack of foundation in market prices of goods and commodities which is the prime cause of universal depression. Nothing less than cancellation in one form or another will give relief.We are all agreed as to the validity of the arguments for cancellation, but I venture to set them out once more.In the. first place, I doubt whether it is yet generally realised in the United States that all the advances made to us were made after the United States had entered the War, and before the Armistice; They were all definitely intended  and, in fact, certified under the Liberty Bond Acts to prosecute our common purpose. The United States could not, naturally, put men into the field immediately after her entry into the War; she put money instead. That position was fully recognised in the United States at the time, and was made clear in more than one speech, both in the Senate and in Congress.It was, in part, because we recognised this position that we told the United States in 1920 that we would be prepared to cancel all the war debts owed to us if such a cancellation could form part of a general cancellation of inter-govern-mental war debts. That was a suggestion which would have imposed a greater comparative burden on us than on the United States. The interest on the internal loans out of which our advances to our Allies were made amounted to about  80 million a year, or about 2 per cent, of the total national income. The interest on the internal loans out of which the United States war advances were made amounted to a little over one-half of 1 per cent, of her national income.Nevertheless, to continue the historical sequence, we endeavoured to reach a settlement, and in December 1922 the War Debt Settlement was made. That settlement was much more onerous than the settlement subsequently made by the United States of America with other debtor Powers. It was equivalent (calculated on a basis of 4^ per cent.) to a remission of 18 per cent, of the debt. The French settlement involved a remission of 50 per cent, on the same basis, and the Italian 68 per cent. These figures do not, however, give the real disparity between these settlements. Our settlement was made some years earlier than the others/and out-payments were heavy: from the start, whereas the payments by France and:Italy were insignificant in the earlier stages;and only, become crushing in the later years. Up to date,- although bur,; debt was only .40. per cent, of the total war debts due to America, we have paid over 80 per cent.:of the total payments
received by America. Our settleirient-^and the others i reached later^was,:;of f course, based on the assumption of world ^ecqnomio..recovery.,and increasingu prosperity.  It was an assumption almost universally made at the time.;   *u--   ; -Moreover, we were entitled to assume, at the time that our payments; would, be recovered by receipts of German, reparations and from our own debtors.All these assumptions have been belied by the course of events. ,   - ,,    / ,^Such is the historical case. There are other arguments and other facts which might be adduced. I turn to the present problem, and in particular to&apos;the problem of the 15th June. :The world has painfully learned that payments from one nation to another can only be made (leaving aside the sale of securities already held in,the.creditor country and the possibility of fresh borrowing) in gold, in goods, or in services. There is not enough gold in the world to pay the war debts. What gold we have we can only send to the United States at the risk of further depreciating sterling, and so increasing the debility and uncertainty which have already disturbed the economy of the whole world.The United States have themselves put it out of the power of the world to pay in goods or in services. Their tariff has been steadily increased to keep out competitive goods at all costs. In the year in which the Agreement was signed the value of British exports to the United States was about double the payment due. All the United States of America now receive in goods from us is (owing largely to their tariff) one-third or less of the payment due. The United States have maintained a steady excess of exports over imports, not only with us but with the world an excess which between 1923 and 1931 was never less than 250 million dollars in any year.Nor will the United States accept payment in services shipping is the most obvious example. It has been estimated (by Sir Alan Anderson) that from 1920 to 1932 the United States have spent in subsidising shipping in one way or another some  600 million. They thus make it impossible for us to pay in services.Great Britain and the other European Powers concerned made one more effort to reach a settlement at Lausanne an effort which was, to some extent, encouraged by suggestions from the United States that we should first settle our problems on this side of the water. Agreement was reached at Lausanne. It was necessarily provisional. To reopen it now might be fatal to the prosperity of Europe and the world. Subsequently, in spite of our having agreed to renounce practically the whole of our claims, we made the payment due to the/United States last December. That was an exceptional effort. It was made in part because we realised the difficulties of the United States Administration in an inter-regnum between two Presidencies. It was made partly because we recognised the difficulties created for any United States Administration by the state of American public opinion. It was made I had almost said in spite of public opinion here. And the time is coming when we may have to remind the United States that theirs is not the only public opinion that must be taken into account.How then can we continue to pay? In spite of our view of these loans we have struggled for years to meet our obligations. We have done what we could to increase our exports. We have been bound to reduce our imports, including our imports from the United States. We have taxed ourselves more heavily than any other nation. We have &quot;shown willing &quot; until it has become obvious that we were cramping the whole world in our endeavours to meet our bond.The attempt to exact large sums in reparation from Germany has given the world an object lesson in the disastrous effects of trying to force international payments which were not made possible by a natural flow of goods and services. Germany only paid reparations while she was able to borrow still larger sums abroad. Once the flow of foreign capital ceased, not only did reparation payments break down, but the foreign creditors became alarmed lest efforts to continue the payment of reparations should endanger German stability; they lost confidence; they withdrew funds so far as they could. In so far as they could not, their own position became compromised. The loss of confidence spread through Europe. One country after another imposed new defensive restrictions on trade and exchange, -and insecurity spread everywhere; Reparations ;and war debts and the forced transfers for which they: called have been almost a dominant cause of -the economic collapse of the past two years.: That fall :in-wholesale prices to which every economic : observer. constantly
reverts is itself largely due to the endeavours Which made to meet theseunnatural-obligations.. Every debtor has.been driven.to try to make ultimate payments in gold; that has forced up the price of gold and so forced down the price of commodities. Every debtor has been forced to struggle to right the balance of ^payments both by selling at lower and lower prices in order to increase exports and by restricting imports, and so again forcing down prices by reducing world demand. And prices cannot rise; trade cannot revive; traders, cannot embark on &quot;new enterprise, or even continue former undertakings, until some degree of security, and with it some degree of confidence, is restored.The immediate question is whether we should, if called on, add one more strain to the tottering structure of world trade and development on the 15th June. No one can dislike a suggestion that we should not meet an obligation more than I do. The easiest course is to go on saying that, at whatever cost, we must honour our signature. Were the only question at issue the question of whether this country should make a further sacrifice, I should agree that we must pay. But if we are to be asked to pay for an unproductive 1919-20 loan, originally made in the interests of the creditor as much as in the interests of Great Britain to pay, in spite of the barriers which the creditor has erected to those very payments for which she asks our answer should most regretfully be &quot;No.&quot; If we were to pay America, we should have to turn to our own debtors and exact payment from them, whatever the political as well as economic conse-quences might be. But we cannot afford to break up Europe in order to placate America, and to ruin both in the process. The only way out is to make up our minds that we shall not continue a system which we believe to be largely responsible for the present state of the world.Mr. Moley said to Sir R. Lindsay on the 23rd May that the substance of the Presidents letter to the Prime Minister was that &quot; there was nothing particular that His Majesty&apos;s Government have to do at present.&quot; This may be a good or a bad sign, but it shows that the President does not expect payment by us on the 15th June. How best to handle him is a matter of first-rate diplomacy into which I am not venturing; all that I suggest at present is that we should make our own determination to hand over to America whatever we receive from Germany and our other War debtors and to retain nothing for ourselves, thus making no profit on reparations and repayments, but we should make no further payment.(Signed) WALTER RUNCIMAN.May 24, 1933.
