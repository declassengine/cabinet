(THIS &quot;DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERNMENT. )SEC RET.COPY NO.C.?i   145 (33).C A .B I  NET.PERSIA MD ARMS TRAFFIC CONVENTION.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.The Foreign Office proposal in CP.  136  (33) isthat the Persian Gulf shall cease to he a &quot;special maritime zone&quot; under the new Arms Traffic Conventions and a fresh regime substituted under which the new Persian Navy   v/ould he solely responsible for the supervision of vessels flying the Persian flag in the Gulf.2, The Admiralty view, based on a long experience,of control of the arms traffic at sea in the Gulf and elsewhere5 is that unless our warships are permitted  tc check the illegal use of the Persian Flag, effective maritime control is impossible.    A dhow laden with arms could readily hoist the Persian flag on sighting   a British warship and change to any other flag in the unlikely event of an encounter with a Persian gunboat, thus avoiding control altogether.    If the only vessels to escape control were bona fide Persian vessels, the matter would not he very serious, since the responsibility could then he brought home to the Persian Government, always nervous of arms reaching her turbulent tribesmen; but if, on the other hand, any gun-runner, irrespective of nationality, were to he free to employ the cover afforded by the Persian flag on meeting a British warship, effective control of the arms traffic at sea would he impossible.3. The Admiralty fears on this score are greatlyincreased by the fact that the above considerations apply with equal force to the slave trade in the Gulf, since
H.Mo Government have already indicated their readiness to make a Slavery Treaty with Persia v/hich would provide that the   Persian   Navy should be solely responsible for vessels flying the Persian flag.    It is the Admiralty view that any Treaty on these lines, whether slaves or arms he the subject matter,  to be effective requires supplementing by provisions to prevent the use of the flag as a ruse. They are anxious that a proper precedent should be set by the Treaty now under consideration,  to be applied subsequently to the slave trade,  since they are apprehensive that H.M.Government would be open to grave criticism if -a traffic in slaves were to grow up in the Gulf which the British Navy would be powerless to suppress. 4.      The reasons given&apos;for the Foreign Office proposal may be &quot;briefly summarised as followss-(a) The new arrangement would avoid friction with Persia and secure her co-operation,  and(b) It is impossible to obtain any better arrangement.5.      To take these objections in order.    Even since the Treaty negotiations with Persia were initiated,  attempts have been made  to bring her to a reasonable frame of. mind by concessions.    She has secured the removal of the civil air&apos; route to Arabia and  the withdrawal of the Indo-European Telegraph Department,  and has been offered,  amongst other things,   the withdrawal of the Residency from Bushire and the cancellation of the major part of the war debt. The only effect of this policy has been to whet her appetite  for more,  and  the whole process culminated last year in  the demand for the immediate evacuation of Henjam
and the unilateral and illegal termination of the D&quot;Arcy Concession.      In these circumstances can it really be hoped that a further concession will have a diametrically opposite effect?6. With regard to the Foreign Office view that itis impossible to obtain a better arrangement, it is at least permissible to point out that no attempt has yet been made to secure Persian assent to a compromise on the lines mentioned in paragraph 9 of CP.  136(33).      So far as can be gathered from the despatch to Tehran reporting the Secretary of State&apos;s interview with M.  Sepahbodi, the main Persian objection to the zone regime is that under it Persian ships would be subject to constant interference and &quot;might even find themselves taken away to distant ports for investigation more than once on the same journey&quot;.      This objection would be completely met by the compromise,  since no ship proved by verification of the flag to be Persian could be interfered with at all.        If it is borne in mind that it is to the interest of Persia, with her turbulent tribesmen to control,  that any revival of the arms traffic should be checked,  it  is surely not unreasonable to  suppose that  she would agree to an arrangement which at most might mean that a vessel actually entitled to the Persian flag would occasionally be asked to  show her papers. 7. The proposal to abolish the special zones in thePersian Gulf is the main desideratum from the Persian point of view;    compared with this,  the verification of the flag is a mere detail.8. The Admiralty therefore wish to press for aproposal to Persia on the lines of the compromise mentioned
in paragraph 9 of CaP. 136(33)D      If the Persian Government suggest reciprocity;, it could &quot;be explained to them that,, as they are well aware, the British.Delegation are unable to speak for India, and (if the Arabs are mentioned) that we are unable on teehalf of the British-protected Arabian principalities of the Gulf to enter into such an agreement without their consent?      but that, so far as the United Kingidom is concerned, we are prepared to g rant reciprocity,,9.      If a compromise on these lines proves unobtainable, the Admiralty would much prefer that the Persian Gulf should remain a special zone, and they would suggest that to disagree with the Persian Government on a compromise so reasonable in itself would, if properly   handled, avoid the impression at Geneva that we were &quot;bullying&quot; a small country, since it could be explained that Persia had proved intractable over a matter involving no loss either of prestige or otherwise to herself, which, nevertheless, constituted the essential difference between an effective and a farcical system of arras traffic control.I0o    The Admiralty does not agree that the Foreign Office proposal would furnish powers precisely equivalent to those we should retain under a Convention similar to that of 1925, for the reason that we now possess in the Gulf a customary right, with perhaps little legal foundation but nevertheless substantial, to search native craft (dhows).     This right we could hardly avoid denouncing under the proposed Treaty^ Admittedly,, with the Persian Government in their present mood and the arms traffic quiescent, to invoke this right would be the height of folly, but if, as is probable, the
power of the central Persian Government declines, or if a recrudescence of arms traffic occurs, its retention might prove invaluable.11. V/whatever the position de jure , the Admiralty are infact exercising a control in the Persian Gulf which would be impossible under the ]?oreign Office proposals.(Initlld.)    B.E-M.25th May, 1955.Further note by the First Lord of the Admiralty, in view of the discussion at&apos;the meeting of the Middle East Ministerial Sub-Committee on the a 5 th May.The Foreign Office reply to   the Admiralty arguments by saying that we would in fact be giving up nothing by adopting the Foreign Office proposal, since our customary rights have not been exercised for some years. 2. The Admiralty point out that it has not been necessary to exercise these rights, because slaves and arms are not at present being run in the Gulf and they contend that this is due to two reasons -(a) the financial and political conditions;    and(b) the existence of these customary rights, on v/hich are based the standing instructions to His Majesty&quot;s ships, which are a strong deterrent. This may well account in part for the non-existence of the traffic3. An attempt might be made in the future,    e.g- ,if the Shall died, to revive either traffic, and in that event the exercise of&apos;our present rights, or similar powers under some other guise, would be essential if the slave and arms traffic were to be kept under.
to n 6 64. The Foreign Office also say that it is of far greater importance to obtain the Persian declaration that they would, only interfere with Persian shipping;; to this the Admiralty reply that all previous experience goes to show that the Persians will stretch to the limits any rights they acquire.        They are quite capable of claiming that Trucial Sheikhs and some other Arab States are actually under Persian sovereignty still and that thus their new declaration will apply to these Arab dhows. This might start a new controversy with Persia.(Initlld)      3,E-Mo26th May, 1955.
