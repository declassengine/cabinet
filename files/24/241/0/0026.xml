THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1933;SECRET.CP. 146 (33).CABINET.STATE OF NORTH BORNEO.. Suggested Purchase from the British North Borneo (Chartered)Company. : ...      .    (sA;Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.        .  .THE State of North Borneo has an area of about 31,000 square miles and a population of about 260,000. The British Government assumed a formal protectorate over it by an Agreement dated the 12th May, 1888. By that Agree-ment the territory is to continue to be administered by the Chartered Company as an independent State under the direction of His Majesty&apos;s Government, who may appoint consular officers, and shall conduct all foreign relations, but will.not interfere in internal administration. The State is governed by a Court of Directors, whose President is Major-General Sir Neill Malcolm, K.G.B., D.S.O., and whose office is at 17, St. Helens Place, E.C. 3.2.   The other British territories in Borneo are : (a) The Island of Labuan, a British Colony since 1848 and now constitutedone of the Straits Settlements; (6) The State of Brunei, under British protection; and (c) The State of Sarawak, also under British protection.The total area under British protection in Borneo is about 83,530 square miles, almost equal in size to England, Scotland and Wales, with a population of about 770,000.   The rest of the island is Dutch.3. The only link between the four British territories is that the Governor of the Straits Settlements is Governor of Labuan, High Commissioner for Brunei, and British Agent for Sarawak and the State of North Borneo. There is not even any machinery for the exchange of ideas or for the pooling of experience.4. The first difficulty to be overcome in devising a scheme for closer co-operation between the four separate British administrations in Borneo is the fact that one of them is a chartered company directed from London. So long as this condition exists, even a loose-knit federation of all British interests in Borneo could not be formed.5. When Sir Cecil Clementi came on leave in the Spring of 1931, he was-authorised to discuss the matter informally with the Chairman of the Company. He reported that Sir Neill Malcolm fully realised that the present form of government was an anachronism and that sooner or later it was inevitable that the different British territories in Borneo should be united in closer connection; that the position of the North Borneo Chartered Company differed from that of either Sarawak or of Brunei owing to the Court&apos;s responsibility for and to the shareholders; and that if there were, to be a federation of British territories in[8660]Copy No. 35&quot;.&apos;
Borneo, the Federal Governor could not accept responsibility to the Court and to :; the Shareholders of the Company, while, if the present form of government were &quot;to continue in the State: of Nbrth Borneo, the position Of the Governor of that territory with responsibility both; to the Federal Governor and to the Court of Directors in London would be extraordinarily difficult.   Consequently, Sir Neill Malcolm considered that the only possible solution would be for the British Government to buy out the shareholders of the Chartered Company as had been i;done in the case of Nigeria and elsewhere.   -6. Sir C. Clementi reported his discussions to Lord Passfield, and was informed that there was no chance whatever of financial assistance from the Imperial Government, and that the only source from which any payments to the &apos; British North Borneo Company, or any grants-in-aid of revenue in the future, or any financial guarantee, could be looked for must be the Government of the Straits Settlements. Discussions were continued on that basis, and finally Sir C. Clementi Was told by Sir Neill Malcolm Court of Directors, basingtheir calculations on Borneo profits for the four years 1926-29, and making a very modest allowance for improvements, which, in their opinion, the shareholders were entitled to expect, would ask for a sum of about  1,000,000 sterling, the Government of the Straits Settlements to make itself responsible for debentures and certificates of indebtedness. On his return to Singapore in June 1931, Sir C. Clementi appointed a Committee &quot; to consider and advise whether it is expedient for the Colony to acquire the fixed and governmental assets of the British North Borneo Chartered Company, and, if so, on what terms.&quot;7.   The following is a summary of the  Committee&apos;s -conclusions  and recommendations : (a) The Committee is unanimously in favour of the proposal to transfer the administration of British North Borneo to the Colony, provided that the financial side of the transaction can be satisfactorily settled without casting any burden on the revenues of the Colony.(&amp;) The Committee recommends that, in the event of an offer being made, the whole of the Chartered Company&apos;s interests in Borneo should be taken over. -   -(c) The Committee is of opinion, based on the material put before it, that, inthe event of an offer being made, that offer should take the form of an exchange of Government bonds for shares, debentures and certificates of indebtedness.In addition, it would be necessary that Government bonds should be issued in order to raise the cash required, not only to take over the State Bank and to acquire the Company&apos;s interests in the Timber Company and any other local interests it may be desirable to acquire, but also to provide a reasonable working cash balance.(d) The Corrimittee calculates on the basis of 4 per cent, interest and asinking fund of 1 per cent, that the debt charges on the bonds required for the above services will amount to some  125,000 a year for a period of 40 years; and that a further sum of  50,000 a year will be required to meet essential capital expenditure for renewals and maintenance of the value of the property.(e) The annual surplus funds at the disposal of the British North BorneoGovernment at the present time appear to be between  60,000 and  70,000 only, so that at least a sum of  100,000 must be made available from some source other than the revenues of British North Borneo. The Committee is unable to recommend that this, or any sum, ought properly to be found from the revenues of the Colony. (/) The Committee is therefore of the opinion that, if-it is proposed to proceed in the near future with the scheme for the transfer of the Chartered Company&apos;s interests in Borneo to the Colony, representa-tions should be made to the Secretary of State for the Colonies with a view&apos;to securing the co-operation of the Imperial Government; that &apos; co-operation to take the form &quot;of a guarantee of the debt, charges and of any deficit which may arise from the provision of necessary capital expenditure for maintaining and; developing the property.
. Xff) The Committee considers that, if the proposal; is,,proceeded without should be on the condition that the Chartered Company . should obtain . and hand over to the Colony, in addition Lo its own holding, in the Timber Company, such further control as would: ensure the.Colony possessing: the controlling interest desired; the additional cost a of acquiring such control to be included in the main transaction,; r j. (h) Finally, the Committee is unable to foresee when the revenues.of British North Borneo will be able to show a surplus sufficient.to-cover, the cost of the acquisition of the territory by the Colony.I am advised that, so long as the present system and scale of administration continues, the Committee&apos;s estimate of the probable cost  100,000 a year-may provisionally be accepted as reasonable. It is likely, however, that a change from Chartered Company government to Crown Colony government would necessitate a higher scale of expenditure. It is impossible to give any forecast, at present, of the additional expenditure which this change would involve.    &apos;8. Sir C. Clementi endorses the recommendation of the. Committee that representations should be made to secure the co-operation of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, and he advances the following grounds for reconsidering Lord Passfield&apos;s decision that no financial assistance can be given by His Majesty V Government(a) It should be the aim of British statesmanship to secure greater cohesionbetween the four territories under British protection in Borneo, and a necessary preliminary to such a policy must be the establishment of Crown Colony Government in the State of North Borneo, instead of administration by a Chartered Company.(b) The era of haphazard development is over, and improvement of com-. munica Lions has made group action in matters of common concern ; profitable as well as possible. The problems which arise from Communist propaganda and from Chinese immigration, the call for fiscal combination and for the scientific study of agriculture and forestry, the marked success attending on co-operative effort, all point ; the road to closer collaboration between contiguous units of the same empire. The opportunity for beneficial collaboration noticeably exists in the component parts of British Borneo.(I do not myself think there is much force in the argument about the development of resources. The Chartered Company is likely to look to this and, so far as Imperial trade is concerned, Borneo gets the advantage of Imperial preference, and, indeed, obtained some special advantages from the Ottawa Agreements.)(c) The system of government by a chartered company is out-of-date, and canneyer be as stable or as efficient as that of a Crown Colony. The surplus revenue of a young country with large undeveloped areas should be re-invested therein, but the shareholders of a chartered company have invested their money with a view to sharing, first of all, . in the distribution of any profits which may accrue, and its Court of Directors is confronted with the impossible task of reconciling mutually conflicting duties, namely, those which they owe to the share-holders and those which they owe to the territory under their admini-stration. Inevitably, therefore, there is an atmosphere of insecurity in the State of North Borneo, which undermines public confidence in the administration and retards development. id) The State of North Borneo possesses the four finest harbours in the island of Borneo, that at Sandakan being one of the best natural harbours in the Far East. Its commercial and strategic potentialities are, there-,,       fore, considerable.; (e) The financial implications of the surrender by the Chartered Company of its administrative powers have been examined at a time when the fortunes of the State of North Borneo are at the lowest ebb, and when the whole world is in   the trough of unprecedented commercial, ,;(   depression.   It may confidently be hoped that British North Borneo .. &quot;   will share; in, any revival of prosperity in the world at large, and that the financial risk of assuming responsibility for the government of that territory will appreciably decrease in future years, and before long disappear entirely.
(/) The potentialities of British North Borneo, as regards agriculture, forestry and minerals, are considerable, and there is now the opportunity of making &quot; a profitable bargain.&quot;9. Sir C. Clementi is satisfied that he could not convince local public opinion that the Straits Settlements Government was being fairly treated, if the entire financial burden of the transaction was placed on the local Government. The abstention of His Majesty&apos;s Government would throw doubt upon the soundness of the transaction, and suggest a speculative element which he believes to be absent in fact. Moreover, since he holds that the final justification for his recommendations must rest on Imperial policy, he regards Imperial co-operation at the start as essential. But, as he is convinced that the Straits Settlements Colony will ultimately benefit in strength and resources, if the transaction is carried through with the co-operation of His Majesty&apos;s Government, he is prepared to urge that the Colony should participate in the financial burden in spite of a local financial position which would normally preclude any extension of Government activities not leading to immediate profit.10. Moreover, Sir C. Clementi feels strongly that the present is the most favourable moment for the transaction. The economic depression provides an opportunity for the purchase of North Borneo at the lowest price ever likely to prove acceptable to the Chartered Company. The opportunity may not recur in so favourable a form. Sir C. Clementi urges that, apart from the general development which is likely to follow in the wake of returning world :prosperity, there is a possibility of the discovery of an oilfield in North Borneo (it is described by Sir C. Clementi in a private letter as &quot; imminently possible&quot;). Negotiations for exclusive prospecting rights are at present proceeding between the Chartered Company and the Shell Group. If they are granted and oil is discovered in quantity, the financial prospects of the Chartered Company would undergo an immediate improvement.11. The matter has been discussed at an Interdepartmental Conference, over which Lord Plymouth presided at my request, and at which the three Defence Departments, the Colonial Office, and the Treasury were represented. The representatives of the Defence Departments all expressed themselves in favour of the policy so strongly urged by Sir C. Clementi, and held that the buying out of the Chartered Company should be carried through as soon as possible.12. I desire directions as to whether the Colonial Office should open negotiations with the Company, with the view to ascertaining (without com-mitting His. Majesty&apos;s Government) what are the minimum terms that the Company would accept. If the Cabinet consider that this step should be taken, it would be a matter for subsequent consideration whether the terms are such as His Majesty&apos;s Government could accept, and, if so, what would be a fair division of the cost between British and Straits Settlements revenues.P.
