He has supplied me with the annexed admirable and informing Memorandum,Kj? B-jS V. : ,   &apos; - : W&apos;f&apos;f.    . SfettriMay 27, 1933.,The Secretary of State has requested me to draw up a short Memorandum for the.use of the Cabinet on the internal position and the external ambitions of Japan. The following observations are an attempt to present; the salient points within a measurable compass : Internal Position. ki^d*    oWl &apos;onr/It is impossible for anyone to speak with certainty as to the feelings of the masses of the: Japanese nation. The people, who can now all read and write, are peculiarly open to new ideas and to new enthusiasms, and it is impossible to say how far such doctrines as that of communism have really taken root. It is sufficient to say that respect for the Emperor, though it is far less widespread than is usually believed abroad, is sufficiently strongly held by a number of. truculent individuals to exclude the possibility of any subversive movement against the. Throne. Whether parliamentary government will continue to develop in; Japan or-whether it will give way to some other form of administration, no one can at the moment foretell. Reactionary elements, which in Japan have a strong socialist tinge when questions of property and big business are involved, have up to now shown little promise of being able to direct the Government themselves. The political situation may therefore be considered as reasonably stable when existing world conditions are taken into account. t , ^The financial position would have been thought disastrous some years ago, but,; again when compared with that of other countries, cannot he described as critical. The deficit of some  100 million which exists is due; much less to the expenses of the Manchurian campaign than to the heavy expenditure which is being incurred on re-equipping the army. This is unlikely to continue for. more than one.year more.. During the period between the earthquake in 1923 and in 1931 the army was starved as regards equipment; and for the last eighteen months the;military party,, which has had a freehand, has been busily -engaged, infringing, their armaments up to the most modern European standards, &quot;i^ .,V,&apos;Foreign&apos;Aspirations. ,.-0! , tv        . ......c,,-Japan has no foreign aspirations outside Asia, arid the fears of California and British Columbia are groundless. The question is how far her Asiatic aspirations go. It appears-to-me that-for-thetime being, these do not extend further than Manchuria.  For the Japanese, Manchuria is a sort of fetish, and6901   [8658]
nothing short of armed force will &quot;induce her to forgo her supremacy in that country.. Outside Manchuria nationalist sentiment cannot be calledoipon-to^assist a forward policy, and the present operations which are proceeding south of the Great Walt 4. are intended to bring pressure on China and induce,,her,,tQ.,.come to some taerf arrangement regarding Manchuria, and to drop the%6yc6t^dffiBrail&apos;yi The idea prevalent in some quarters that the Manchurian sore cpulHTba sefTofi against the boycott sore, and that a stalemate would gradually%T4nftt e-&quot;Iw0 parties together seems to me a dangerous one. To the Japanese the boycott is just as much a form of war as is the dropping of bombs from aeroplanes, and they will continue to reply to the former procedure by continuing the latter. If the political aims of Japan are confined to Manchuria, it must not be supposed that she has no economic aims in China Proper. The fact is that the Chinese market is of far greater importance to her than it is to any other foreign country. With her population of 60 millions expanding at the rate of close on 1 million a year, and the continuous raising of tariff walls by most of the countries of the world, it is not too much to say that the market of China is a vital necessity to Japan, and she will not allow it to be closed against her without a struggle.Japan and the League of Nations. ,-&apos; i-Japan has left the League with genuine regret. She did so because she believed she had to choose between remaining a member and sacrificing her vital interests. The threat of sanctions has been a potent factor in making her embark on her military re-equipment policy. For just as she regards the boycott as a form of war,, so she regards sanctions; and she is determined to defend herself against the latter by the only means at her disposal. In this connexion it must always be borne in mind that Japan, like many other countries, has a pre-war mentality, and that her geographical position makes Geneva remote.United States.      1 &apos; [r-&quot; this&apos; Relations between the United States and Japan can only be described as thoroughly bad. As is well known, the United States have followed a policy of considered hostility to Japanese expansion in the Far East, ever since the Russo-Japanese War; and the Exclusion Act of 1924 turned what was merely a slight grievance into a thorough-going hatred. For the Japanese, the American people are considered as the enemy, but I have yet to meet a Japanese who considered a war with America as other than the utmost folly. If a war does break Out between these two nations, it will begin on the American side, through some unhappy incident, such as that of the Maine in the harbour of Havana.   :Russia. &quot;While the general population regard America as the enemy, we have little doubt that the army concentrates its whole attention on a future war with Russia. If one looks at the map one will see that the newly-acquired territory of Manchukuo--for it may be said to be acquired in all but name would be nicely rounded off by the acquisition Of the maritime provinces of Russia, and the constant development of the power and range of aircraft is causing uneasiness, to the Japanese military leaders owing to the proximity of Vladivostok to, the lines of communication between Japan. and the mainland. If this aeroplane development continues, it will not be long before even the centres of population, in the archipelago can be threatened from that port, and there is reason to believe that this possibility has not escaped the General Staff.Armaments.As regards Japan&apos;s probable aftitude to disarmament, it can safely be said that she will agree to no modifications which will impair her supremacy by land and sea in the Far East. With this proviso it is not impossible that Japan will-consent to some measure of disarmament.-. .F. O. L.  \. Foreign Office, May 20, 1933.   , : ,    .
