As regards petroleum oils, complaints have been received from certain omnibus proprietors that their supplies will cost more, and a number of Scottish traders have claimed that Russian kerosene is particularly suitable for the engines employed in fishing vessels.The timber position, however, has raised several difficulties, and I have therefore had the attached note prepared in the Board of Trade in order that my colleagues may be fully aware of the difficulties.As regards ,licences under Section 2 of the Act, it has been my policy to grant them where it can be shown that payment for the goods to be imported was substantially made before the Proclamation was issued.

G7RUSSIAN GOODS  (IMPOST PROHIBITION) ACT,   1935.TIMBER.Memorandum prepared in the Board _of Trade.__.1.    The position has been discussed with Timber Distributors Limited, whose contract covers the whole Russian supply of sawn softwood*  and from their account it appears that the prohibition has thrown a very large section of the timber trade into confusion. - The 435,000 standards (value about  3^ million) covered by the contract between Timber Distributors Limited, and the Soviet exporters represent about one-third of our imported supply of this class of timber.     The prohibition also covers some 50,000 standards of similar timber produced from Russian logs in other countries; principally Finland and Lithuania, but it has been decided to licence these goods, for reasons explained later in this note.2.    Of the 435,000 standards of sawn timber produced wholly in Russia, contracts have already been entered into by importers for the sale of 375,000 standards.     These goods will in many cases have been resold, often more than once, and thousands of contracts are involved.     Where Russian supplies are specified,  the contracts are for the time being inoperative, but where traders have contracted to supply goods so specified that the contract could be fulfilled by alternative supplies, considerable losses may be involved in obtaining such supplies.     There has been already a slight rise in the price of timber, and fears have been expressed that the competitive position of British industry will be damaged, particularly if the Russian
6 8supplies which would have come to this market are thrown, on to other markets and so csuse prices in those markets to fall.      It is by no means clear that in certain important lines an actual shortage may not take place, since the felling season is now at an end,  and,  whatever the potential supplies from other sources, the actual supplies for the present season are now strictly limited.      stocks are stated to be low,  and it is said that the &quot;carry over&quot;   &apos; of Russian timber from last season is now exhausted. It is stated in the latest Lloyds Bank konthly Review that many sizes and qualities are becoming very scarce.      It thus seems possible that housing may be affected.3. The position is greatly aggravated by the inevitable uncertainty as to the duration of the prohibition.    Traders will naturally hesitate to purchase on a rising market from which the bottom may fall out at any time if the prohibition comes to an end.      The position of the importers is rendered the more embarrassing by the terms of their contracts with the Soviet exporters.      The latter have contracted to ship certain quantities between the first open water and July, and until the end of this first shipment -period no importer knows whether he will be absolved from having to take delivery of Russian supplies to be shipped in this period. Consequently he will hesitate to purchase alternative supplies,  since if the frohibition were removed his Russian contract would again become effective and he would be left with a double sup-ply on his hands.4. The position, of Timber Distributors Limited vis-a-vis the Russian exporters (the Y/hite Sea Timber Trust) is one of considerable doubt, and it may be that if the prohibition comes to ai  end at a late date in the season, they will be
under a liability to take up the balance of 50,000 standards   j now unsold.      It is not suggested however that any Government action is possible in this matter.5. As regards the issue of licences for the importation of timber,  two major problems have had to be considered -(a) the case of the sawn goods produced from Russian logs in other foreign countries and (b)  the case of the sawn timber produced wholly in Russia in respect of which advances have been made by United Kingdom interests prior to the proclamation.6. As regards the former problem, it was at first thought that such goods were outside the scope of the prohibition in virtue of Section 1 (4) of the Act,  which provides that goods partly manufactured in the Soviet Union and partly manufactured elsewhere are to be deemed to be manufactured in the Soviet Union unless 25% or more of the value at the time of exportation to the United Kingdom is attributable to processes of manufacture undergone since the goods last left the Soviet Union.      It has now been held that this Section does not apply, and it follows that if the goods are to be admitted at all, it must be under licence.7. Inquiries were made through the Timber Trades Federation, and the question was also discussed with the Lithuanian and Finnish Ministers, who made representations on the matter.     Lithuania and Finland are the countries principally concerned.      The Finnish saw mills purchase logs (or standing timber), and the logs are floated down the rivers while they are free from ice from Russian territory where the  trees are felled to Finnish territory where the saw mills are.   Logs received during one season are not dry enough for use until the next season, and the mills are,
therefore, now cutting supplies received during 1932. Payment for the whole of the present year&apos;s supplies was made &quot;before 31st December, 1932.     Further advances have been made to the Finnish saw mills by various British banks amounting to  178,000 to iinance production in 1933. In the case of Lithuania the logs are imported by rail, and it does not appear that the whole of the supplies for which contracts have been made for this year have yet arrived, nor have they been wholly paid for.    The Lithuanian State Bank, however, have guaranteed payment for the season&apos;s supplies in terms which would not be nullified by a refusal on our part to permit importation,     Further about 80$ of the value of the goods f. o.b. represents costs incurred in Lithuania.      It is understood that the Finnish saw mills have Russian logs sufficient to manufacture some 40/45,000 standards for all markets, of which contracts have &quot;been made for about 15,000 standards for the United Kingdom and a further 10-15,000 standards might also be sold to the United Kingdom if there were no prohibition.      (These are the Federation&apos;s figures:    the Finnish Minister&apos;s estimates were lower).     In the case of Lithuania,  the quantity of logs received is put by the Timber Trades Federation at 25,000 standards, with another 10,000 standards expected.     Of the sawn products, 12,000 standards have been sold to the United Kingdom (not paid for) and a further 13,000 may be expected to be sold.8. It was represented to trie Board of Trade that if these supplies could be admitted,  the difficulties resulting from the exclusion of sawn goods produced wholly in Russia would be considerably eased.     The matter had also to be considered from the point of view of commercial relations with Lithuania and Finland.     Goods which are the &quot;produce or
manufacture&quot; of each of these countries are entitled to most-favoured-nation treatment in the United Kingdom, and therefore, if these goods were held to he Lithuanian and Finnish, their importation could not he prohibited unless the prohibition applied equally to all similar foreign goods. There is no internationally accepted interpretation of the term &quot;produce or manufacture&quot; of such and such a country, and it does not appear, therefore,  that our interpretation could be effectively challenged.      It might, however, have been regarded by these countries as unreasonable that we., should permit the import of goods 25% of the value of v/hich has been added by further processes of manufacture outside the Soviet Union, but refuse to permit the import of goods of the value of which certainly more than 25 per cent, has been added by sawing and haulage in countries outside the Soviet Union, on the basis of a definition of what constitutes manufacture which is not free from doubt,9. There appeared to be two practicable alternatives.   The &apos; first, which has been adopted, was to treat these goods as if they are Lithuanian or Finnish, as indeed they are,   This course brings the greatest relief to the difficulties of the Timber trade, avoids difficulties in our forthcoming commercial negotiations with these countries, and brings no new money to the Soviet Government which they would not have received in any case.     It involves a certain risk, though not a great risk, that the Soviet Government may export additional logs not already contracted for.     This risk is guarded against by the warnings which have been given to all concerned that the decision to admit these goods by licence will be reconsidered if there is any tendency that might endanger the objects of the Proclamation,  and H,M.Representatives
In- jth&amp; ^^oun^rri-e-s.-cKmcernedThave- &quot;been Instructed to report any evidence of this.     The alternative would have been to limit imports to the amounts already contracted for by importers in this country.     This would have about halved the available supply from these sources of some greatly needed timber, and might thus have created pressure for a relaxation of the embargo.     Such a coxirse would have left Finnish and Lithuanian sav/ mills in a position of considerable difficulty and might have thus complicated forthcoming commercial negotiations with those countries.10.   The other problem in relation to timber was whether licences should be issued in respect of sawn timber produced wholly in Russia to the extent necessary to permit advances made against such timber to be liquidated.     The timber in question is part of that covered by the underwriting contract for 435,000 standards referred to in paragraphs 1-4.     The advances made are thought to be limited to those shown in the following table:-1 i Firms concerned. ...       . . -!	Amount of advance. ........... .....	Amount of timber covered by advance.	Amount per standard of timber. -I	 	Standards.	 .    s.    d.Russian Wood Agency..	215,000	42,000	5.    1.    7Brandt&apos;s (Timber	150,000	37,500	4.    0.    0Brandt&apos;s         ) (bankers)    ) Hambro&apos;s         )jointly Lazard&apos;s         )	252,660	46,000	-5.   10.    0	617,660	135,500				
11.    In the third case, the advance was made in &quot;sperrmarka&quot; (i.e. blocked German currency held in connection with &quot;standstill&quot; advances) hut was to he repaid in sterling.    In all these cases the advances were to he repaid from the proceeds of the sale of timber to the amounts shown in the third column of the table, the repayment per standard being as shown in the final column. These repayments would represent about 75%* 609 and 80&apos;/:. respec-tively of the f.o.b. value of the timber, and the first and third cases would, therefore, be covered by the working rule referred to in the final paragraph of the President&apos;s note, and it is proposed to treat on these lines the third case, which so far as it has been investigated, presentsno special difficulty. In the case of the Russian Wood Agency, however, there was the difficulty that the advance represents nearly the whole capital of the Company ( 240,000) of which Russian interests represent  130,000, the balance of  110,000 being held by three firms of brokers from whom representations have been received.    It did not appear that these firms were in a position to give any effective undertaking that, if the advances were recovered by the importation of timber under licence, the money so received, or at any rate the proportion equivalent to the Russian interest in the Company, would not be used in a way that might relieve the financial embarrassment of the Soviet Government.    This application has therefore been rejected.12.    In the second case, that of Brandt&apos;s Timber Agency, the advance represents less than 755? of the price payable to the ^white Sea Timber Trust.    In a rather similar case, in which advances of some  31,000 had been made against the importation of wood pulp logs representing 33^% of the price of the logs, the importers were informed that if they could make an arrange-ment under which 7b&apos;,C of the price would be treated as a refund
of advances made a licence&quot; would be granted.     The White Sea Trust aaid that they would agree to this but only on the condition that further advances would be made to cover the last part of the contract.     This, of course, was out of the question, and the Department maintained their position. The White Sea Trust have now agreed without conditions.      It is proposed to treat Brandt&apos;s case, where the sum at stake Is much larger, on similar lines.Board of Trade,19th May, 1933,
