THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1933.SECRET.Copy No.35CP. 142 (33).CABINET.TAXATION IN KENYA.Memorandum by the Secretary\of State for the Colonies.I &quot;DESIRE to bring before my colleagues the situation which has arisen in Kenya in regard- to the imposition of further taxation on the non-native community. . ..   \ -,1. Early in 1920 a proposal from the then Governor of Kenya to increase the rate of native poll tax was approved on condition that the taxation of non-natives was correspondingly increased by means of an income tax.. The-taxwas unpopular and its collection was hampered by the maximum of dilatorihess and the minimum of co-operation on the part of the taxpayers. The collection for one year (though spread over several) fell far short of the official estimates. In 1922 the tax&quot; was dropped, the additional revenue from non-native sources being provided by large increases in the rates of customs duties.2. In 1931 the Joint Committee of Parliament on Closer Union in East Africa recommended a careful and detailed examination of the financial situation in Kenya with respect to the contribution made to taxation both direct and indirect by the different racial communities. This enquiry was entrusted to Lord Moyne, who was also asked to make recommendations as to the readjustment of taxation and expenditure.In his report Lord Moyne advised :-(a) that increased taxation was necessary to produce a balanced budget in the Colony;(&amp;) that the native population could not fairly be expected to make heavier contributions to revenue;(c) that the non-native population in Kenya is fortunate as regards theexisting low scale of direct taxation as compared with other civilised communities;(d) that an incojne tax was the fairest method of&quot; increasing the non-nativecontribution to revenue.3. The course of events has fully justified Lord Moyne&apos;s forecast. Accord-ing to the latest information which I have received, the revised Estimates for the Colony for the current year anticipate a total deficit on the year&apos;s working of  176,095, which will reduce the excess of assets over liabilities on the 31st December next to  75,939.. This deficit would be even greater were it not for drastic measures of economy and retrenchment which have been adopted during the past year. It is therefore obvious that the budget cannot be balanced without some form of increased taxation.4. The line which I have taken hitherto in the House of Commons, in Kenya, and in receiving deputations, has been that in spite of drastic economies it is necessary that there should be an increase in taxation in order to restore the financial position of the Colony and balance the Budget; that income tax appeared to be the fairest form of taxation; and that, although there was nothing sacrosanct in the principle of an income tax, no alternative form of taxation had been put forward.[8645]b
5. An Income Tax Bill was accordingly drafted and was published in the month of January. It was desired that ample time should be given before the Bill was debated in the Legislative Council for the consideration of its detailed provisions; and at the end of March the Bill was formally introduced in Council.An intensive campaign has been organised against income tax. All the European Elected Members of the Council have opposed it. A petition against income tax has been signed by more than half the adult European residents. It is to some extent true that the opposition is based on ignorance of the exact incidence of the tax; but there is no doubt that there is also a very real opposition to income tax in principle. Indian opinion is divided; but I think it is fair to say that the majority of Indians would probably prefer income tax to the alter-native forms of taxation, to which I shall refer later, because they think, and think rightly, that it would be easier for them to avoid the payment of income tax than the payment of other taxes.6. The Government in Kenya have no Press and little or no publicity, and they are, in fact, in spite of all the Governor&apos;s efforts, unable to get their case presented to the country. Incidentally, the Times correspondent has written steadily against income tax.7. If.the matter rested there I should still feel it my duty to advise that, in the interests of financial stability, we should proceed with the imposition of the income tax, in spite of the fact that the tax would be collected by a staff new to the work, and in the teeth of an opposition which would use every expedient to delay or avoid payment. In these circumstances, and in the light of previous experience, I should certainly hesitate to accept, at any rate for some years, the official estimate of a revenue of  130,000.8. A wholly new situation has, however, arisen in the last few months. There has been a general acceptance of the fact that new taxation must be imposed; and, faced with this necessity, the Nairobi Chamber of Commerce and others formulated a series of alternative proposals for raising revenue.9. I authorised the Governor to appoint a special Committee to examine and report upon these alternatives. The Treasurer presided over this Committee, which was composed partly of Government officials, including the Attorney-General, the. Chief Native Commissioner and the Controller of Customs, and partly of unofficials, including European and Indian members of the Legislative Council, the member representing native interests, the President of the Association of Chambers of Commerce of East Africa, the President of the Nairobi Chamber of Commerce, and the Chairman of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce in Kenya. This Committee can, therefore, be fairly regarded as representative of all sections of the community.10. At the same time I approved a proposal made by the Governor, which I thought very fair, that the Income Tax Ordinance should be passed through the Committee stage in Council, but should not be given its third reading; and that the Income Tax Ordinance as so amended, together with the alternative proposals and the special Committee&apos;s report on them, should be submitted to me for a decision. :11. I have now received both. As regards income tax, assuming it would work according to plan, I think it would be fairer in its incidence. But, against its value in theonf, I am bound to admit, as I have already stated, that it will be resisted by many taxpayers by all legitimate means; that the possibility of collecting the right amount of tax from the Indians is remote; and that the revenue is problematical. To these objections must be added another of at least equal importance, namely, that no income tax could be collected during the current year, and, indeed, that no substantial revenue could be expected from it until towards the end of 1934. It must also be obvious that, if income tax is forced through now, its unpopularity is likely to grow in comparison with the alternatives which have been put forward by the taxpayers; and income tax payers will increasingly believe that they would have been better off under the alternative proposals, the attractiveness and popularity of which will not be lessened by the fact that they have been refused a trial.
12. Turning to the alternative proposals, the Committee have recommended six as practicable and calculated to produce substantial revenue. The proposals are as follows:- -A graduated non-native Poll Tax, based on income; r  ..An extension of the system of Trade Licences; A Landing Tax on Passengers; A Package Tax;An increased Tax on the registration of companies (1 per cent, on nominal capital); and increased stamp duties on Bills and Promissory Notes.Of these proposals, the first two the graduated non-native Poll Tax and Trade Licences are at present in force in Tanganyika Territory, where they are working satisfactorily and bring in a substantial revenue.12a. The revenue from these six proposals is estimated by the Committee to produce  111,000 in a full year. A more cautious estimate put up by the Governments Advisers is  94,000, and it is expected that, by their immediate introduction, a sum of  74,500 on the lowest estimate will be received during the current year. The Package Tax and the Landing Tax will involve agreement or some arrangement with adjoining Territories, but little difficulty is anticipated on this score.13. I ought at this stage to make it clear that it will be administratively impossible to introduce income tax in Kenya without following suit in Uganda and Tanganyika. Neither of these Administrations is at all in favour of income tax. It is not necessary in the case of Uganda and the yield from it would be small, while Tanganyika, which has grown accustomed to the Trade Licences and Graduated Poll Tax, would very much prefer to retain its present system. In neither Territory do I think an income tax desirable on its merits.14. &apos; The alternative taxes suggested are admittedly crude in nature, but they are considered to be workable, and I think they are. They will fall, substantially, upon the same people in the Colony as would be affected by income tax, but with less skilful discrimination. The Indian community will probably pay more under the alternative proposals than under a system of income tax; but I do not think they will be unfairly treated, as the rates to be paid on low incomes are in any case small, and they are paying these taxes in Tanganyika.15. It may well be that the people who press for the adoption of the alternatives do not really appreciate the merits of the case. But the situation now is that the opposition have admitted that further taxation is necessary and have suggested definite alternatives. They accept the principle that they have got to bear further taxation, but they ask that they shall have the taxes in the form which they prefer rather than in the form chosen by Government. A powerful argument in support of the alternatives is that some revenue, at any rate, will be produced during the current year when it is urgently required. Moreover, the revenue from the alternative taxes would be found with the co-operation of the unofficials, while income tax would certainly be obstructed.16. If the alternative proposals are adopted and income tax is dropped, one of three things will happen. Either the alternatives will work and produce the necessary revenue and the tax payers will be satisfied with them, in which case the situation will be satisfactory; or they will fail to produce an adequate revenue; or, while producing revenue, they will be found to be unpopular in practice, with the result that the tax-payers will ask for a system of taxation more justly and scientifically adapted to capacity to pay. In either of the last two events the Income Tax Bill, which is already in draft and has received detailed examination, can be imposed with a larger measure of acceptance.17. In these circumstances, I think political expediency and common sense dictate that I should give the alternatives a trial, pointing out that they must be judged in the light of experience both in their capacity to raise revenue, their practicability, and their acceptability&apos;in practice as an alternative to income tax to the people who have to pay, and I ask the Cabinet to approve this course. [8645] b 2
18. I attach a series of telegrams which have passed between myself and the Governor since the income tax and the alternative proposals have been submitted to me for decision. I regret to find myself in disagreement with the Governor as to the wisdom of the course which he wishes to follow. For the reasons which are fully set out in my telegrams, I think the course he advocates is wrong on merits, and is in fact made impracticable in the circumstances by the line which he took, and I think rightly took, in the consideration and submission of the alternative proposals.19. I thought it right also to consult Lord Moyne, who conducted the financial enquiry in Kenya and recommended the introduction of income tax. I have shown him all the papers, including the telegrams which are annexed hereto, and he is very definitely of opinion that the only possible course to adopt in the circumstances is to give the alternatives a trial. I have also consulted the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as I was anxious, before submitting my recom-mendations to the Cabinet, to have his advice both financially and by reason of his special and personal knowledge of Kenya. He has authorised me to say he entirely concurs in the proposal which I am now submitting to the Cabinet. I accordingly ask authority to adopt the course recommended in this paper.20. In approving the alternative proposals I shall suggest certain modifications in detail, with which I do not think I need trouble the Cabinet.P. C.-I,Downing Street, May 26, 1933.
APPENDIX.Telegraphic Correspondence between the Secretary of State eor the Colonies and the Governor of Kenya.&apos;    (1) .        - ^   &apos;   JParaphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to theGovernor of Kenya.(Sent 10-30 p.m. 11th May, 1933.) Urgent and Secret, No. 116.The despatches, debates, report on alternative proposals, and your letter have been carefully considered by me, in consultation with my advisers. It appears to me that the following facts are established : I. The imposition of new taxation which can be collected this year is of urgent importance.2. It is evident that income tax cannot be collected this year, and that, before it can become completely effective, it will, under best circumstances, take some years.3. Alternatives recommended by Committee are, on the other hand, practicable; and alternatives can be made applicable this year, subject to-equitable arrangement, as regards package and landing taxes, with territories adjoining.4. The net revenue obtained from alternatives over the next few years will exceed the aggregate of income tax revenue, even assuming that income tax can be collected effectively, which is very doubtful.5. Trade licences and graduated poll tax are, in fact, working in Tanganyika satisfactorily.6. Although the incidence would be more crude and less fairly adjusted, the alternative taxes will fall broadly on the same people as income tax.1 7. In addition to officials the Committee which reported in favour of the practicability of the alternatives contained representatives of both the European and Indian commercial communities. I presume, therefore, that I am right in inferring that, on the whole, European and Indian commercial opinion prefers the alternatives to income tax.I note that, as a result of an assurance from the Attorney-General that other taxes might ultimately be reduced, one Indian member ultimately voted for income tax. I have announced publicly that reduction should be on the lines most beneficial to the trade of a Colony, if and when the taxes in any Colony can be reduced.   You cannot go further.8. As I see it, the position therefore comes to this : The non-native community, rightly or wrongly, expresses the view that in preference to scientific income tax &quot;they prefer to pay taxes levied in the cruder form of alternatives.9. I cannot, in these circumstances, resist the conclusion that common sense and political expediency dictate that alternatives should be accepted by us and be given a fair trial, so that they may be judged by the light of experience in their acceptability in operation to the people who have to pay and in their capacity to-raise revenue.10. It seems to me that in forcing income tax before the alternatives have been tried we should take a great and unnecessary risk. Every taxpayer would be increasingly convinced that the untried alternatives would have been a popular success. Should the alternatives succeed you have your revenue paid willingly. Should they fail in result or be found unpopular the case for income tax is established.II. The Governments in Uganda and the Tanganyika Territory do not wish to introduce income tax. It is neither necessary nor worth while in Uganda. In Tanganyika they prefer to rely on existing methods.[8645] b 3
I propose, therefore, to advise the Cabinet that the alternatives should be adopted and given a fair trial. I will defer submitting this to the Cabinet until I have had your reply to this telegram, but a decision must be taken rapidly. I am inclined to suggest certain modifications in detail, e.g:, on incomes above  2,500 a progressive increase in the rate of graduated poll tax, which. Scott admitted to me, he considered fair; in the interest of the honest taxpayer, adequate powers to Government in regard to poll tax returns. In approving the alternatives I should also propose to suggest that the question whether companies will, in fact, pay a fair share of taxation in the combined incidence of alternative taxes should be further considered.(2)Paraphrase Telegram from the Governor of Kenya to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.Dated 16th May, 1933.(Received Colonial Office 12-14 p.m. 16th May, 1933.)Immediate.   No. 98. -My assumption had been that judgment on the case for income tax versus -alternative proposals was to be formed purely on the fiscal merits of the proposals, but as the weight attached by you to the question of political expediency is appre-ciated by me, I regard it as my duty to set out the assumptions on which it seems to me that you have reached your provisional decision, and to explain why, in my opinion, those assumptions may prove to be ill-founded : (1) that as a whole the non-native community prefer the alternatives; (2) that the revenue resulting from the alternatives will, during the next few years, exceed the probable yield from income tax; (3) that a safe guide as to the result and method of working trade licences and graduated income tax in Kenya can be taken from the experience of working those taxes in Tanganyika; (4) that the introduction of income tax will still be possible at a later date if the alternative proposals fail to produce the revenue estimated.The following deals seriatim with the above : (a) the terms of reference of the Committee on alternatives were confined strictly to the feasibility, not to the desirability, of the proposals. The report was only signed by the official members -on this understanding- Specific assurance was given to Abdul Wahid that signature by him would not be regarded as signifying that he preferred the alternative proposals seeing that he definitely preferred income tax. The Indian National Congress have supported and reaffirmed his attitude. The alternatives are preferred by a section of Indian commercial opinion, but the difficulty of ascertaining opinion among the Indians is the same as it is among Europeans. There is unanimity in neither community and if you are prepared to accept as representative of European opinion the view of the elected members, then I submit that constitutionally the view of the elected Indian members of the Council, both of whom voted for income tax, and also that of Canon Burns and that of the Arab members must be accepted as the representative opinion of the community repre-sented by them. No public discussion has been held regarding the relative merits of income tax vis-a-vis alternative proposals and where the latter are preferred it is partly for the reason that they are admittedly temporary in character (vide alternative proposals report, page 13, paragraph 7) and capable of being easily rescinded, so that the fact that they may be unequal in incidence and unscientific has been largely discounted. Definite dissent was expressed by the official members from the view that the trade-licences&apos; tax would not be passed on. The case for the imposition of income tax has, however, been based always on the necessity for permanently broadening the basis of taxation and for increasing the taxation on non-natives for the reasons emphasised Lord Moyne&apos;s report, paragraphs 111-119, with which, in the House of Commons, you expressed agreement in general, (b) On such information as we can obtain, the estimate of  130,000 in a full year is conservative, and I consider that it would produce more than the alternative proposals, unless you contemplate general passive resistance, which I, personally, do not.   (c) Conditions in Kenya are so different
from those in the Tanganyika Territory, that; it Is not safe to assume that the result of the working of graduated poll tax and of trade licences will be the same, vide my despatch No. 52, Confidential, of the 29th April, Appendix VII and IX. This applies particularly to graduated poll tax. (d) The objection of Francis Scott and his immediate supporters to income tax is in principle, and they would never alter that opinion, even if the alternatives failed. In the Colony the present issue is generally regarded as a trial of strength between the Secretary of State and the Elected Members. Any hope of being able to revive income tax later by agreement is therefore quite illusory under the existing Constitution if income tax is now dropped.I am in agreement with the view that no revenue can now be anticipated from income tax in 1933, but the position is somewhat improved this year see my telegram No. 92 of the 11th May and as compared with the question of establishing a basis of revenue which should assure a balanced budget in 1934 and subsequent years, I regard a deficit this year of minor importance.The verdict of His Majesty&apos;s Government in this matter will naturally be loyally accepted, but in view of the terms of your telegram under reply I have felt it my duty to give you this full appreciation of the issues involved in amplification of the views expressed in my personal letter of the 28th April, in order that before a final decision is made you and the&apos; Cabinet may be in full possession of the facts as I and my advisers see them. This refers to your telegram No 116 of the 11th May.(3)Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to theGovernor of Kenya.(Sent 10-30 p.m. 17th May, 1933.)Private and Personal.The arguments in support of trial of alternatives were set out concisely in my telegram No. 116. You advise the adoption of a different course in your telegram No. 98. For your frank statement of your views I am obliged to you, but how do you meet the following points :- An accurate appreciation of the present position and how it has arisen is necessary in the first place.It has been stated publicly by you and myself that income tax and the alternatives should be referred for my decision or &quot; for my impartial arbitration,&quot; as you phrased it in the meeting with the elected members. In accordance with your suggestion, which I considered correct, you were instructed by me to submit income tax and the alternative proposals, the former in final form, the latter with a considered report. Later I accepted your suggestion for the postponement -of the third reading of the Income Tax Bill. I entirely agreed with the propriety of this procedure, but I find it impossible to reconcile the position so publicly stated with the suggestion in your last telegram that the present issue is regarded generally as a trial of strength between the elected members and the Secretary of State. To my mind this seems to amount to a demand that income tax must he forced through without regard to any merits in the alternatives or to any questions of administrative and political convenience of the nature which I have set out as far back as my letter of the 21st March. If the adoption of this position were right, and I personally do not regard it as reasonable, the line should surely have been taken by us from the beginning that no alternatives could be considered and that income tax had to go through.With regard to the merits and practicability of the alternatives, I must put to you certain considerations : 1. Trade Licence Tax. I find it difficult to see why this tax is either impracticable or unfair. In Tanganyika it is in fact working satisfactorily. From the Governor I have ascertained that neither at its inception nor during its currency has objection been taken to that tax on the ground that it is an
indirect tax which is passed on to the consumer. Any tax in theory may be passed on; but, in fact, particularly with regard to the smaller trader, does he not, irrespective of tax, make on both purchases and sales as large a margin as he can. A further insurance in this respect, moreover, is competition and the large number of traders. The consideration also impresses me that in so far as money is being made, it is being made by the trader and middleman rather than by the primary producer, and this appears a good reason for the increase of the form of direct tax which you already impose on these classes of non-natives. The prevailing opinion also impresses me that the collection of income tax from the Asiatic trader will be very difficult, whereas a trade licence tax is easy to collect and simple in its incidence.2. Graduated Poll Tax.- A precedent for this already exists in Tanganyika, and the Government of that territory is opposed to income tax at the present time in Tanganyika. I am informed by the Governor that on merits he would infinitely prefer to tighten the administration and increase, if necessary, the scales of graduated poll tax. As regards the type of tax, I can see no difference in principle between an income tax and a graduated poll tax. It has already been stated by me that the rate ought to be made steeper on incomes above  2,500 if a graduated tax is adopted. The proposal is criticised by Surfleet in his memo-randum on the grounds that the powers of administration would be less than in the Tanganyika Ordinance. No one can object to effective powers of administra-tion being taken if the principle of the tax is accepted. To safeguard the honest taxpayers such provisions are necessary. Not much importance appears to be attached by you in your last telegram to the opposition to income tax. This runs counter to your earlier advice (11th March) as to the &quot; intense hostility &quot; against income tax, your statement (1st April) that &quot;one is now up against a stone wall and this has to be recognised,&quot; and the fact that a petition against income tax has been signed by half the adult European population.As regards the probability of the estimate of income tax being realised, in earlier years at any rate, it must surely be accepted by us as a fact that, if the alternatives are rejected, there will be the minimum of co-operation; and regu-clarity of collection, even in a country where income tax is an established fact, depends a good deal on the co-operation of the taxpayer. Furthermore, has the comparative failure to collect the tax in 1921 and 1922 been taken into full account in framing the estimate ?I do not see why, as a matter of practical politics, the trial of the alternatives makes income tax more difficult to enact and collect if the alternatives fail. I should have thought the converse was the case. If the alternatives have not been tried income tax will be increasingly inacceptable and unpopular. Your financial position is secured by general consent if the alternatives are tried and succeed in acceptability and revenue. On the other hand, if the alternatives fail in these respects and it is felt by the majority of people that income tax would be fairer and more practicable, you have the necessary proof and support. I accept your view as regards the Indian community that the majority would probably prefer income tax, but is it not true that many Indians do so because they know that they could largely avoid paying it ? I assume, as regards the fairness of incidence, from the parallel of the Tanganyika Ordinance that a licensee will be entitled to treat his trade licence fee, in assessing his income for graduated poll tax, as a necessary expense in producing his income.I note that there is no considered appreciation by the Treasurer as to the prospects and practicability of income tax as compared with the alternative taxes either in the memoranda or the debates you have sent me.Your telegram No. 92 of the 11th May discloses a financial position which I am definitely of opinion makes it urgently necessary this year to obtain increased revenue.
Paraphrase Telegram from the Governor of Kenya to the Secretary &apos;of Statefor the Colonies.Dated 20th May, 1933.(Received Colonial Office 9-45 a.m. 20th May, 1933.)Private and Personal.The arrangement that the alternative proposals and income tax were to be submitted to you for impartial arbitration was, I agree, made at my suggestion.The purpose of my telegram No. 98 was to ensure that your decision, in so far as considerations of political expediency might influence it, was founded on full appreciation of local political situation, in so far as I am able to gauge it, and of probable repercussions of course of action proposed by you.The proposed alternatives were a last-minute resort which the Nairobi Chamber of Commerce originated, and which the elected members adopted when they realised that blind obstruction to income tax or any other form of taxation would be futile.I considered it reasonable, as this constituted a gesture of co-operation however belated, to adopt the procedure which has been followed even though the inevitable delay in consequence by so doing was obviously playing into the hands of the opponents of income tax measure. There is, of course, no more to be said if you are of opinion that the alternative proposals are preferable to income tax on their merits, but, if you are not, the issue is then whether income tax is not to be introduced merely because of the opposition aroused in certain quarters. On this point it is that it is regarded a trial of strength. With the exception of trade licences, the alternative proposals in my view are open to the same objections as those put forward against income tax, without the compensating advantages of scientific administration and stability. The tax on companies is frankly a tax on capital. The tourist trade, which we are anxious to foster, may prove to be deterred by the landing tax, and this, in less.degree, applies to package tax, which it is clear will cause difficulties in administration and possibly with Uganda.In your opinion graduated poll tax is the same in principle as income tax though deficient admittedly in the machinery necessary for the protection of the taxpayer and for equitable assessment, and if rates are made more steep without any provision for double income tax relief. I consider that the trade licences tax is neither impracticable nor unfair. The one consideration is that if it is passed on there may not be the same immunity in the case of the native and the European farmer as he would get under income tax, which was the intention of Lord Moyne. I have no desire to suggest that income tax will not be met by opposition, but this opposition is not as solid as it was when I wrote in March or when Francis Scott sailed, owing to the publication of the alternative proposals. Although the communities around Kitale and Eldoret press for more control financially, they do not object in principle.The principle is openly supported in the Kenya Weekly News by Couldry, who states that his view is now shared by many farmers. Your observations on the view of the Indian majority are noted by me, but I feel bound to indicate that a purely impersonal view governs the attitude of no community.It is equally fair to say that those who enjoy substantial incomes, whether private or earned, who under the alternatives stand to pay much less, are most fierce in opposing income tax. My statements in my telegram No. 96 should be referred to as regards extra revenue in 1933. In this year of drought there is much to be said for not unduly pressing for additional taxation, provided that the future is assured by fiscal measures of a permanent nature. When your decision on the main issue is communicated, this can be examined. The Treasurer is now at Mombasa.The question has been discussed by me with him on many occasions and he has never expressed opposition to my views. An opportunity was given to him of taking part in the debates in income tax, but he did not desire to take it.
Questions regarding the amount of revenue the Treasurer anticipated from tax have been answered by him.It is a cause of deep regret to me that my opinions should apparently run counter to yours, but I have throughout been consistent in considering that the proper solution was income tax., and it would be wrong for me not to be perfectly frank with you.This refers to your telegram of the 17th May, personal and private.\
