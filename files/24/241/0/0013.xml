8 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 QOVERNMLNT.SECRET o CP.033/33),Copy NoeCABINET.IMPORTS AND EXPORTS PROHIBITIONS CONVENTION. MEMORANDUM BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE.My colleagues will remember that in connection with the discussions which took place in September and October last, as to the possibility of our imposing a limitation upon the imports of meat into the United Kingdom, it was decided that, because of the difficulties which might arise out of our obligations under the Prohibitions Convention,  the Convention should &quot;be denounced   so as to terminate on the 30th June, 1933. / Cabinet 55 (32), conclusion 6, and C.P0&apos;s 295, 316 and 342 (32)jj7The Convention can be terminated on the 30th June this year,  and if we do not withdraw from it on that date we shall be bound for another year-unless all the parties agree otherwise.    If we are to withdraw, it is, I think, necessary for us to give reasonable notice of our intention to do so, and we must,  therefore, inform the other parties to the Convention of our intention before the meeting of the World Economic Conference.    It is the possible effect of such action at this particular moment which impels me to revive the question once more in spite of the fact that a decision to withdraw from the Convention was reached on the 26th October last.It is perhaps unnecessary to go into any detail as to the history of the intention of the Convention or of the efforts made to put it into force.    It is sufficient for the present purpose to say that a large number of countries signed the Convention, largely as a result of the strong recommendations of the Economic Conference of 1927 that barriers to trade,  of which prohibitions were the most objectionable,  should be reduced,   A number of countries also signed the Instrument
i obringing the Convention into force, but most countries aqqompanied their signature by reservations which in fact resulted in their not becoming parties to the Convention, and at the present time six countries only are bound by it.    They are, besides ourselves, the United States, Japan, Denmark, The Netherlands, and Norway.The arguments in favour of our withdrawal from the Convention are, shortly:-(l)    that since we are bound by our most-favoured-nation obligations to most countries in the world to accord to them the same treatment as we accord to the parties to the Convention, we are bound in this particular matter practically to the whole world, whereas other great countries,  for oxample, France, are free to impose prohibitions without reference to the Convention,(s)    that two of the parties to the Convention, Denmark and the Netherlands,  have introduced systems of import restriction, pleading in defence the &quot;catastrophe&quot; clause which gives parties the right &quot;to adopt measures ......... for thepurpose of protecting,  in extraordinary and abnormal circumstances, the vital interests of the country&quot;.    The use of this right by the countries in question and its possible use by other parties to the Convention lead to the conclusion that the rights secured by the Convention are of little value to this country.The arguments against withdrawal are:-(l)    that we are bound by the Anglo-German Treaty to refrain from imposing prohibitions upon imports and that our obligations under that Treaty are even more stringent than those under the Convention, since there is no &quot;catastrophe&quot; clause in the German treaty.    It should, however, be pointad out that the difficulties arising from the German Treaty might be surmounted by agreement v/ith Germany^ and that such agreement might b^e arrived at without great difficulty in the case of any commodity not of vital interest to Germany.
(2)    that it is, speaking broadly,  in our interest as a great exporting country to reduce the opportimities which foreign countries enjoy to place prohibitions and restrictions on our goods.    Our withdrawal from the Convention might have some effect in giving further encouragement to such restrictions,(3)    that while it is true in theory that the Convention . hinds us in regard to our treatment of the goods of most countries of the world while only six countries are similarly hound In relation to us, this fact is of only theoretical importance.    The only cases in which we have desired to impose quantitative restriction upon imports are those relating to agricultural produce.    In all those cases with the exception of meat the intention is that restriction ot import a t5on should he accompanied by some regulation of production and distribution within the country.     Prohibitions imposed in these circumstances are excepted from the operation of the Convention by the terms of Article 4 (7),    The Convention does not, therefore, in practice hamper the measures which we desire to take.    In the ^articular case of meat, it va.ll be remembered that the only country boiind by the Convention, which supplies any meat to the united Kingdom is the United States.    (No problem arises under tho German Treaty since meat from Germany is prohibited on sanitary grounds,)    It was decided in October that should the United States challenge our action,  the reply should be a reference to the &quot;catastrophe&quot; clause of the Convention,    The decision to withdraw from the Convention at the earliest possible date was, taken at the same time.It was in fact solely because of the difficulty in defending regulation of meat imports that the Cabinet came to the conclusion that we should withdraw from the Convention on the 30th June next.
Board of Trade,Actually the.question of our restriction on imports of meat has not &quot;been raised.     It vd.ll be seen from the considerations set out above that the arguments for and against withdrawal are fairly evenly balanced, and that it is not oaBy to come to a definite conclusion as to the policy which should be pursued.    It would seem, however, unlikely that the Convention will in practice put any obstacle in the way of any measures which we are likely to wish to adopt in the next twelve months, and I am afraid that our withdrawal at the very moment when the World Conference is meeting in London at our invitation would at least have the appearance of being an action directly contrary to the professed objects which we have in view.    I am therefore, reluctant to proceed on the decision of October last without giving my colleagues an opportunity of reconsidering the matter in the light of all tho circumstances.    My own inclination would be to refrain from withdrawing from the Convention on the 30th June,next.
