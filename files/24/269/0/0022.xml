                   t153Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1937.SECRET.                                                         Copy No.CP. 117 (37).CABINET.INCREASING  THE  PRODUCTIVITY OF  THE SOIL.        Memorandum by the Minister of - Agriculture^ and Fisheries.    AT its meeting on  the  24th  February,  1937, the  Cabinet decided that Ishould set up an Inter-Departmental Committee composed of representatives ofthe Ministry of Agriculture  and Fisheries, the Department of Agriculture forScotland and  the  Treasury  &quot; to  make  definite  proposals  for increasing the productivity of our own  soil  with  a view to ensuring increased food productionin time of  war.&quot;  The  Committee was constituted accordingly and I circulate herewith the Report which I have received from it.  I must draw attention tothe fact that the question of increasing the productivity of agriculture in NorthernIreland, which might be a valuable source of additional  supplies in  time of war,is not dealt with in the Report.    2.  An Interim Report  by the  Inter-Departmental  Committee  indicating the lines on which it was working was considered by the  Sub-Committee of theC.I.D. on  Food  Supply  in Time of War on  the  24th March,  1937.  The  Sub-Committee  noted that the Inter-Departmental Committee contemplated a recom-mendation  for increasing the cultivation of wheat but not of barley and oats and they asked that an examination should be made  and a statement preparedof the arguments for and against assistance for  the  purpose of increasing the cultivation  of the latter  two  cereals.  The  Inter-Departmental Committee  have accordingly attached to  their main Report  a  Supplementary Report setting outthe issues involved;  they have not agreed upon any recommendation as regardsbarley or oats.    3.  It  will be seen  that  the Inter-Departmental  Committee&apos;s  recommenda-tions are     (a) The extension of existing facilities  for land  drainage  by means  of          Exchequer grants.    (b) The promotion of the increased use of lime and basic slag by a scheme          for ensuring cheap supplies to farmers.    (c) The raising of the limit to the &apos;&apos; anticipated supply&apos;&apos; under the Wheat          Act, 1932, from 6  million to 8 million quarters with  a view to giving          greater  assurance  to  farmers in respect of their  returns from wheat          and  thereby stimulating an increase in the wheat acreage.    (d) Measures for the improvement of grassland cultivation.    (e) The initiation of a large-scale campaign  for  the  eradication of animal          diseases with a view to the elimination of  the  very heavy  wastage          at  present  caused  by such  diseases thereby  securing improved          productivity  of the livestock  industry;  and the extension  for this          purpose of the State Veterinary Service.    4.  These proposals  are  not spectacular and will not  produce spectacularresults. It would,, of course,  be  possible to  increase the  productivity of our soilto a much greater degree than is contemplated in this  Report, but in the present state of agriculture such a result could only be secured by substantially increasing
the prices which farmers receive for their products.  In view of our trade agree-ments with the Dominions and foreign countries such an increase in prices couldonly be provided by substantial subsidies&apos; from the Exchequer or by guarantees which would involve considerable liabilities for the Exchequer.  In other words,if the  Cabinet were to decide that, on grounds of defence, it was necessary toensure a large and immediate increase in the  productivity of home agriculture,it would be necessary to give subsidies and/or guaranteed prices for all cereals and increased subsidies on a scale beyond anything hitherto contemplated for the livestock and the dairying industries.    5.  Proposals  of  this  kind  would  involve major changes  in our  general economic policy, and the Inter-Departmental Committee have therefore  concen-trated in the main on measures designed to  improve farmers&apos; net returns bylowering costs of  production.  It will  be  realised  that without  spectacularmeasures a restoration and improvement of the fertility of our soil and an increasein the productivity or  potential productivity  of  home agriculture can only bea  comparatively  slow  process after the prolonged  period of  depression  anddeterioration  in the years since the  War.   Moreover, the average farmer willnot react to proposals for increasing returns by lowering costs of production as rapidly as he would to increased and/or guaranteed prices. The proposals madein the attached Report should, however, over a  period of three or four yearsmaterially increase fertility and productivity, and, if there is no further set-backin agricultural conditions, and if the position of the livestock industry (includingthe pig and dairying industries) can be improved,  should enable home agriculture to expand the production of food in any war that may break out after that periodon a definitely larger scale than would be possible at present. .6.  I  recommend  that  the  Committee&apos;s proposals  should  be. adopted.Legislation would be required for the proposals in regard to lime and basic slag,wheat and  the campaign for the eradication of animal diseases, and if any result is to be secured in the  year  1938,  it will be  necessary for such legislation to be passed before the  Summer Recess,  i.e., so that farmers can make their arrange-ments for ploughing  and  fertilising this autumn. I therefore  ask authority toprepare the necessary Bill, with a view to its introduction  after Whitsun and its passage into law by the end of July.    7.  My Colleagues will appreciate  that  the proposals which I am nowrecommending will be regarded as wholly inadequate by the large and very vocalsection  of opinion in Parliament  and throughout the country  which takes theview that it is necessary, on grounds of defence, to  increase substantially the contribution which home agriculture makes to  our food supplies.  They will alsofall short of what is considered necessary and  is expected by the more moderatesection of agricultural opinion, which feels that home agriculture should be putinto a better position to undertake  an expanded food production campaign afterwar breaks out.  It will therefore be essential to present them in their properperspective.  They are not intended to be a comprehensive  or isolated policy, andit would be highly inexpedient to present them  as such.  They should be regardedas a continuation of the Government&apos;s general policy for restoring the prosperity,productivity and  efficiency  of home agriculture, and should be considered inconjunction with the various measures which the  Government have taken in thepast, with the present Livestock Industry Bill and  with future policy, particularlyin regard to pigs and milk, on which I shall  shortly have to submit proposals.Provided that the Committee&apos;s recommendations can be linked in this way withthe rest of our agricultural policy, we can, I think, successfully defend them inParliament and the country.  As the Cabinet  is aware, there is strong pressure for some further statement of agricultural policy in relation to defence, and if my proposals  are approved,  I  should like to make an announcement at a fairlyearly date.  The Whitsun adjournment would  provide a convenient opportunity.                                                                 W.  S. M.

INTER-DEPARTMENTAL  COMMITTEE  ON  INCREASING  THE                 PRODUCTIVITY  OF  THE  SOIL.(Confidential.)                         REPORT BY THE CHAIRMAN.Terms of Reference.    1.  AT its  meeting on Wednesday, the 24th February, 1937, the cabinet decided that the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries should set up an Inter-departmental  Committee,  comprising  representatives   of  the  Ministry  ofAgriculture and Fisheries, the  Scottish Office and the Treasury,  &quot;to  makedefinite proposals for increasing  the productivity  of our  own soil, with a viewto ensuring increased  food production in  time of War.&quot;   A  Committee was constituted  accordingly, and  has agreed to  the  submission of the  following report.    2.  In considering the terms of their remit, the Committee felt bound to haveregard to  certain general considerations  which closely  affect  the nature of their recommendations, and should, therefore, be set out in full:     (1) In the first place, it was assumed that none of the Committee&apos;s proposals           should involve a major change in the Governments economic policy.           In particular, the Committee did not regard themselves as at liberty           to devise steps which would require  new protective measures  for           agricultural commodities.    (2) Secondly, it was assumed that any measures proposed by the Committee           should be consistent with the  normal development of the agricultural           industry.   In making this  assumption, the Committee had in  mind           the undesirability of  measures   the effect of which would be to           stimulate agricultural production to a  pitch which might leave  the           Government faced at some later date with the difficulty of liquidating           a highly artificial situation.    (3) Thirdly, it was assumed  that the Committee&apos;s proposals  should provide           for contributions to the productivity of the soil  which would  be as           substantial as possible within  the above  general limitations.    3.  At the request of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries an interimreport was  submitted  by the  Chairman on  the  22nd March,  1937, and was circulated to the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on food supply in Time of  War  (F.S.  29).   To make this report self-contained  thesubstance  of the interim report is included  in it.  The Sub-Committee on food supply took note of the interim report, and invited the Minister to  arrange forthe inclusion in this report of a section setting out the arguments for and againstassistance to increase  the cultivation  of barley and oats.  As indicated below(paragraph 13), the Committee submit a supplementary report on this subject.Possibilities of Increasing Productivity.    4.  Even with the limitations  referred to in  paragraph 2 there  is a wide field of possibilities in  regard to increasing agricultural productivity.  A reviewof this field led the Committee to consider measures  along the following lines :-     (a) for the improvement of drainage and of the condition  of the soil itself;    (6) for  an increase in the cultivation of  land and for  the improvement of           methods of cultivation;    (c) for  the  improvement  of  grassland management in the  direction of           increased grass production and  the consequent  increase in  stock-           carrying capacity, and with a view to storing up reserves of fertility           in  our grassland  which  would  be available for  a ploughing-up           campaign in time of war;    id) for the improvement of the livestock industry, without which it would be           difficult to secure improved productivity of the soil.    The potentialities under these four heads may be summarised as follows :-    5.  As regards drainage, much can be usefully done at the present time.  Itwas estimated in 1927  that one-seventh of the agricultural area of England and
Wales was  dependent for its  productivity on  efficient arterial drainage;  andalthough since that time a considerable amount  of work has been undertaken onmain rivers  and arterial drains, much remains to be done to improve the drainageof ditches and small streams.  Similarly,  in  Scotland the  primary need  is forschemes of field and hill  drainage.  Works of this kind clearly bring about animmediate and a permanent increase in the fertility of the soil.     6,  The problem of improving the fertility  of the soil itself can most easily be approached by stimulating an increase in the  use of lime and basic slag, which remain effective for a considerable number of years and can be stored, so to speak,in the soil, and are, moreover, produced in this country.  Large areas in Englandand  Scotland are deficient in lime, and there is evidence to suggest that in manydistricts the lime content of the soil is being  steadily exhausted, with the resultthat the land is becoming sour  and losing its productivity.  Liming is, of course,a recognised agricultural practice, but at the present time, apart from the cost ofthe lime itself,  it  involves expenditure on transport and labour which manyfarmers are unable to afford.  Similar conditions apply to basic slag.     7.  Since the Great War considerable areas of agricultural land have eitherfallen out of cultivation altogether, or been diverted to less productive types ofhusbandry.  It is not thought desirable to attempt to  restore land to agricultural purposes by uneconomic and expensive works of reclamation,  but some  of theagricultural land lost since 1919 might be restored, and there is obvious scope for increasing  productivity by fostering  improved cultivation  on land at presentdevoted to  agricultural purposes.  The improvement of grassland is a case in point. Grass is a crop in the production of which this country has a great naturaladvantage for climatic reasons.  It is one  of the best  and cheapest animal foodsat the farmer&apos;s disposal.  Moreover, experiments have shown that it is well withinthe bounds of possibility to bring about a large  increase in  the yield of grass on particular  areas by an efficient  and  enlightened policy of  grassland manage-ment.  It has, in fact, been estimated that the grass yield in  the country  as awhole  could, without strain, be  increased by as much as 15 per cent., which wouldbe the equivalent of 3 million  acres more pasture available for livestock.  Thiswould provide an absolute addition to agricultural  productivity which  wouldmake  possible an increase in the arable  area,  thereby materially reducing therequirements  of the industry in respect of purchased animal feeding stuffs.     8.  A   substantial increase  in  the production  of grass would enable the farmer not  only to economise on his purchases  of feeding  stuffs for his  presentstock,  but   also to  increase the numbers of that stock.  Increased grasslandproduction,  in fact, would almost certainly carry with it an increase in livestockproduction,  and it is therefore necessary to  consider measures relating  to theprofitability of the latter.  As  explained below, the Committee have approachedthis problem from the standpoint of costs of production.     9.  Among the controllable factors which raise the cost  of production of live-stock  and livestock products, the most important  is  the heavy wastage  due  todisease.   The Committee on  Animal  Diseases under the  Chairmanship  ofSir Frederick Gowland Hopkins, which reported in 1934 (Cmd. 4591), estimatedthat 58 per cent, of  dairy cattle leaving herds were disposed  of  on account  of disease.  The prevalence of individual diseases may be judged from the fact thatthe same Committee estimated  that, in the country as a whole, 40 per cent, of thecows are infected, to a varying extent, with bovine tuberculosis, 40 per cent,  withcontagious abortion and 30 per cent, with mastitis.     10.  Nearly all these diseases affect the cost of production in  one  way  or another, increasing the expense of herd replacement, lowering the reproductivecapacity of  livestock and seriously affecting the efficiency of  animals as convertersof animal food into human food.  The Gowland Hopkins  Committee estimatedat  3,000,000 the annual loss  due to the necessity of maintaining herds  at full strength and to meat condemned on account of  disease.   These estimates  take no account  of  the  loss in the productivity  of  livestock during life owing to theexistence of disease, and large as they are, can only form a proportion of the  total loss.   On the available data it is not  possible to make an exact estimate  of this total,  but tentative estimates indicate that it  is of  the order  of  magnitude  of 14,000,000 per annum, or 10 per cent, of the  output of the meat, poultry and
 dairying industries in this country.  The eradication of disease is thus one of the most important steps which can be taken to improve the  permanent  assets and resources of the industry.     11.  Clearly, farmers can never hope to eliminate wastage of this kind by their own  unaided efforts.    There can hardly be any direction in  which the improvement of farming efficiency and productivity is more dependent on Govern- ment action. The Scope of Possible Proposals.     12.  The scope of measures along the lines of paragraphs 5 to 11 is, however, limited by one further consideration.   Any  substantial measures to increase the productivity of the soil must obviously affect the farmer&apos;s  livelihood very closely and,  in  fact, depend for their success on  his co-operation.   But it is clearly impossible, as  a  general rule,  to  expect  farmers  to  take  specific steps for increasing the productivity of their land unless it is made profitable for them to do so. This is particularly true at the present time,  when agricultural recovery lags behind the general industrial recovery of the last year or two.  Any practical proposals,  therefore,  must be considered in the light of what inducement they offer, or can be made  to offer, to those who will be largely responsible for putting them into effect.     13.  The factor  which evokes the greatest response from the farmer is the return which he receives for his produce.  To bring about, increased productivity by measures affecting agricultural prices would involve major changes of policy. Assisted prices for certain products, notably sugar beet and livestock, are already in existence, and, notwithstanding the  importance of the latter, .the  committee liave  not envisaged- any further Exchequer assistance in respect of the prices of these commodities. Other products, such as bacon and dairy produce, might offer scope for  assistance  by means  of a levy subsidy, but  in  these instances trade agreements preclude  any action for the time being.    The possibilities  in  this connection should, however, be borne in mind.  As regards wheat, the Committee report below on the possibility of extending the limit to the volume of production which may receive full assistance under .the Wheat Act.  As regards oats and barley, the Departments represented on the Committee have been unable to agree to make  any recommendation,  and a  supplementary  report is submitted on the issues involved.     14.  Apart from the possibilities mentioned above, it would hardly seem practicable to provide assisted prices without major changes in the Governments general economic policy.  The Committee have therefore directed their attention to the possibility of  increasing the  farmer&apos;s returns by  lowering his  costs of production.     15.  After careful  consideration  of  the whole  field  of possibilities of increasing  productivity,  the Committee put forward  the following  proposals,which are examined in more detail below :-     (a) the extension  of existing  facilities  for  land  drainage by  means of           Exchequer grants;     (b) the promotion of the increased use of lime and basic slag by a scheme for           ensuring cheap supplies to farmers;     (c) the raising of the limit to the &apos;&apos; anticipated  supply &apos;&apos; under the Wheat           Act, 1932, with a view to giving greater  assurance  to farmers in           respect of their  returns from wheat and thereby stimulating  an           increase in the wheat acreage ;*                  .    (d) the improvement of  grassland cultivation  and  management  by  an           intensive  propaganda campaign;  this  proposal is,  of course, linked           with that  in regard to the increased use of lime and basic slag and           the proposals  under  (e) below in regard to the livestock industry;     (e) the initiation of a large-scale campaign for the eradication  of  animal           diseases with  a view to the improvement of the permanent assets of           the livestock industry and  the elimination of the very heavy wastage           at present caused by disease.   *  The representatives of the Department of Agriculture for Scotland and the Scottish Office,while agreeing to this recommendation on its merits, feel obliged  to draw attention to the political difficulties involved in giving further assistance in respect of wheat if no assistance is provided for Scottish oat  growers.
Minor Drainage Works.                                      . -     16.  Since the passing of the Land Drainage Act, 1930, a great deal of work has been carried out on the main rivers and arterial drains in England and Walesby Catchment Boards, with the assistance of Exchequer grants at varying rates.Between 1921 and 1931, a considerable amount of minor arterial drainage wascarried &quot;out with Exchequer assistance, but this was discontinued in view of theFinancial  Stringency in 1931, and has not since been resumed.  All  availableExchequer grants have since 1931 been devoted to work undertaken by CatchmentBoards.   In Scotland,  the  Department .of Agriculture has  undertaken a smaljamount of work of major arterial drainage under powers which have now lapsed,and since 1921 has made grants to promote minor works of field and hill drainageat rates which have been progressively reduced and now stand at 25 per cent, ofthe total cost of the work.     17.  There is now increasing evidence in both England and Scotland to showthat drainage works of a minor character  are required in many districts in orderto improve the fertility of  the  land  or prevent its deterioration.   Many areas are more or less water-logged,  a condition which not only renders some  landalmost derelict, but has other adverse effects for example, in pasture areas dampground encourages the  liver fluke,  which is  a serious source of damage to the sheep industry.  The situation could be comparatively rapidly remedied without difficulty  if the necessary funds were available.  The  Committee  accordingly recommend that funds be placed at the disposal of the Ministry of  Agricultureand Fisheries and the Department of Agriculture for Scotland for the promotion of minor drainage works.     18.  The machinery to carry out -such a proposal is already in existence.   InEngland and Wales- the appropriate bodies would be the Drainage Boards (otherthan Catchment Boards) and County  Councils for those  areas  where DrainageBoards do  not  exist.  In  Scotland  the Department of Agriculture alreadyadministers schemes  of the type contemplated.  The proposal would accordinglyrequire no legislation.     19.  The Committee recommend that  from the available funds grants shouldbe made at a flat rate of 33^-* per cent, of the total cost  of  the drainage worksundertaken.  Grants are already obtainable at higher rates than this in the specialareas, but having regard to the sliding-scale of grants now made in England andWales to Catchments Boards, the Committee consider that the suggested rate isnot unreasonable.  This rate is also thought to  meet the case in Scotland.     20.  Grants  at this rate  might,  it is estimated, lead to works  involving atotal expenditure of  300,000 per annum in England and Wales (the  grantexpenditure, therefore, being  100,000).  Judging from previous experience, thiswould enable drainage works to be undertaken covering about 375,000 acres.   InScotland it is estimated that the proposal would lead to  120,000 worth of workper annum, earning a grant of  40,000 and covering about 170,000 acres.  In both countries  there is a  large area to benefit from drainage  operations and grantscould, if it were thought desirable, be continued on these lines in future years.     21.  It is not thought possible to promote works on a larger scale than this without meeting difficulties in obtaining a sufficient supply of satisfactory labour.In  some districts there are  signs of  a  shortage of agricultural  labour andcomplaints have already been  received that constructional works on  aerodromes,roads, &amp;c, are attracting labour from the  farm. It is therefore necessary to bearin mind the undesirability of arousing resentment among farmers by  constitutingcompetitive demands  on the labour  supply.  In a  scheme on  the scale suggested,however, the situation would be met, if necessary, by attaching certain conditions to the making of grants, e.g., as to the rate of wage and  the period of the yearduring which schemes may be carried out. Provisions of  this kind have alreadybeen found to operate satisfactorily in the case of the schemes undertaken priorto 1931.    * The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries may wish to raise with the Treasury the questionof making grants at rates exceeding this figure in  cases where machinery such, as  pumping plant.is required.
Lime and Basic Slag.                                   ,     22.  In consequence of the prolonged agricultural depression, farmers havebeen unable to apply fertilisers to the land in sufficient quantities to maintain itsfertilitjr.  The problem is one of      (a) making good arrears;     (6) putting back into the soil the fertility which is being removed by current           agricultural operations; and     (c) accumulating in the soil a substantial reserve of fertility adequate to meet           the heavy demands upon it that an intensive food production campaign           in time of war must inevitably make.  .   23.  After  surveying the whole question of fertilisers, the Committee havereached the conclusion  that from the point of view of fertility of the  soil, themost urgent needs are increased applications of lime (principally on arable land)-and basic slag (principally on grassland).  For this reason and  having regardto a number of practical difficulties in the way of  extending any scheme to coverother fertilisers, the Committee consider it  desirable to concentrate effort onsecuring a substantial increase in the use of  lime  and  basic slag, which  are both home produced and have a lasting effect on the soil.     24.  Although the  fullest use would be made of propaganda, it is impossible in the present state of British agriculture to bring about any substantial increasein the use of lime and basic slag unless their cost to the farmer is very considerably reduced.  It is  thought that the reduction in cost should be 50 per cent,  in thecase of lime and 25 per cent, in the case of basic slag.   The Committee are satis-fied that there is no possibility of securing an effective reduction in the changes made by manufacturers, transport agencies or distributors and they have thereforereached the conclusion  that it would be  necessary for the  cost of the proposed reduction to be borne by the Exchequer.   It may be desirable in the first instance to limit the period for which financial assistance will be available.  negotiations are in progress with the manufacturers and suppliers concerned which will, it isbelieved, ensure that the proposed assistance will inure wholly to the benefit ofthe farmer.     25.  As  regards administration, the Committee propose  that arrangements should be made  either to reimburse manufacturers for  agreed price reductions orfor payments direct to farmers in respect of  the cost to them of purchasing limeOr basic slag and  of transporting it to the farm.     This  latter  method would involve  a  certain amount of accounting  work inchecking claims which  could, if  necessary, be  handled by a Central  Authority.There might,  however,  be advantages  in delegating it to  Local  Organisationsresponsible for technical agriculture the County  Councils, &amp;c, in England andWales and the Agricultural Colleges in Scotland.     26.  It is suggested that a list should be drawn up. of &quot;  approved suppliers &quot;&apos;who had agreed to supply at a fixed delivered price.  Payment would be  made onthe  basis  of a  certificate showing the quantity purchased and  paid for at a specified price.   The system of approved suppliers would be a  safeguard againstfraud.     27.  Advice on the use of fertilisers, including liming and basic slag, is atpresent provided by the staffs of Local Organisations.   This would continue andmerge into active propaganda.   It is hoped that these staffs, would  also assist in policing the scheme.     28.  It is estimated that farmers spend about  1,700,000 per annum on limeand basic  slag,  of which approximately  1,000,000  is  spent on lime.  price reductions on the scale  suggested  might  bring about  an  increase of  about25 per cent, to 50 per cent, in the use of lime and about 25 per cent, in that of basic slag.  On the basis of these figures it is estimated  that the  cost  to theExchequer, including costs of administration and propaganda,, would be  in theneighbourhood of   1,000,000 per annum.     These proposals are additional to, but might permit of some modification of,those for the creation of reserves of certain kinds of fertilisers recommended tothe Sub-Committee on Food Supply in Time of War in F.S.  20.
Assistance to Wheat Growers.    29.  Under the provisions of the Wheat Act, if the amount of home-grownmillable wheat sold in  any cereal year exceeds  the  &quot; anticipated supply,&quot;deficiency  payments are decreased  pro  rata.   The  Act  provides  a limit  of27 million  cwts. (6 million quarters) to the &quot; anticipated supply,&quot; and in  the last three years this limit has, in fact, been operative, the average amounts receivedby growers falling  considerably below the standard price of 45s.  per quarter.This limit was determined in the light of knowledge of previous production overa period of years.   It was, however, fixed without regard to defence considera-tions,  and  in present  circumstances could, it  is  thought,  be raised withoutunreasonable disturbance of the balance of agricultural production.  The removalor raising  of  the present limit would offer to growers the prospect of increasedreturns  on their wheat, and  it is suggested that  it  should  be  raised  to36 million  cwts. (8 million quarters).   In practice this would ensure that growerswould virtually be certain of receiving the full 45s. per quarter.    30.  If the limit were raised in the way  proposed, it is expected that theincrease in the wheat acreage would be not more than 10 per cent.,  and that thenew acreage  under wheat  would  be secured partly by ploughing up some-indifferent grassland and partly at the expense of barley and temporary  leys; itis unlikely that any good permanent grass would  be ploughed up.   The total supply of wheat, on the basis of an increase of less than 10 per cent, would not,.except in a year of unusually abundant harvest, bring the &apos;&apos; anticipated supply &apos;&apos;to the limit of 8 million quarters.  A proposal  to raise the limit to this figure is,.therefore,  tantamount to complete removal, but  for political and internationalreasons it is desirable in principle to preserve  some  limit.*    31.  The effect  of the proposal on wheat production would naturally dependon a number of other factors, such as the future course of cereal prices and therelative  attraction   of other agricultural enterprises.  In view of  the  presentfavourable prices for cereals, it is possible that there will be an increase in thearea sown  for the wheat harvested in 1937,  apart from any additional measuresof assistance.  There is, however, no guarantee of permanence in this situation,such as would be provided by a proposal to raise the limit to the &quot; anticipatedsupply.&quot;    32.  The cost  of the Wheat Act is borne by  consumers  of flour and theproposal would involve no charge on the Exchequer.  The  additional cost due toraising the &apos;&apos; anticipated supply &quot; to 8  million quarters would  vary with theincrease in wheat production which followed and with the average price of wheatover the cereal year,  and at present wheat prices, which are about 45s. per quarter,.it would involve no extra cost.   It is estimated that even if  the price of wheatfell as low as 35s. per quarter, the additional cost would be not more than about 500,000 per  annum on the average, and  the effect on the price of bread would beinsignificant it would average about one-fortieth of a penny on the  4-lb.  loaf.and this in circumstances where the consumer benefited to a far greater extentfrom  the fall in the wheat price.    33.  Legislation would be necessary to raise the limit to the &apos;&apos; anticipatedsupply &quot; in the way suggested.  An opportunity for doing so presents itself in the amending  legislation to the Wheat Act which  is at  present under consideration.If, however, approval is given to the various measures put forward in this report.legislation of a wider character would be necessary, and on political and inter-national grounds it  might  be preferable to include the wheat proposal  in that legislation.Grassland Improvement.    34.  The general attitude of the farmer  towards grassland may  be  judged from  the phrase &quot;putting away land to Grass.&quot;   Nevertheless,  an increase in    * Although  the United Kingdom reserved her position in regard to  the Wheat Act in  theInternational Wheat Conference which followed  the Monetary and Economic Conference, 1933,some play was made of  the fact that the Act contains a limit to the &quot;  anticipated supply &quot; whichwould in effect prevent  a large extension of the United Kingdom Wheat acreage.  The raising ofthis limit might now arouse  some feeling  that  we  were  running counter to the spirit of  out-participation in  that Conference and on the  Wheat Advisory Committee which succeeded it.But presumably grounds of national defence would over-ride any considerations of this  kind.
the output of grass would clearly be an absolute addition to the productivity ofBritish agriculture, and would reduce the farmers&apos; dependence on other feedingstuffs;  and,  furthermore,  the  manuring  and  attention  which well-managedgrassland receives, provides  a valuable reserve of potential arable land in  theevent of a ploughing-up campaign during time of War.     35.  Moreover, there is  a growing body of experimental evidence to show-that efficient cultivation, bringing about an increase  in grass production and a consequent increase in stock-carrying  capacity, not only adds to  the net output per acre, but actually results  in higher profits to the grassland farmer.  The first step in a campaign  for increased grassland production would  be to  bring this fact home to the agricultural community.  The  Committee consider that the best way to bring this about would be by means  of a propaganda campaign.     36.  The increased production of  grass would involve  the  increased  use of fertilisers and a campaign to that end would derive great impetus from the fore-going  proposals for  providing cheap supplies of lime and basic slag.  Further,an increase in grass production  is only a preliminary to an increased livestockpopulation, and would clearly link up  with the proposals  set  out  below  for improving the efficiency and permanent assets of the livestock industry.     37.  At the present  time a farmer experiences considerable  difficulty instoring grass otherwise than as hay for the winter months, and has,  in fact, inthose months&apos; to rely to a great extent on purchased  concentrated animal foods.The next few years, however, may see important developments in grass  drying.There are  already some grass  driers operating in this country,  and research isbeing  carried  out into their utility.   The possibilities in this  connection  areengaging the attention of the  Agricultural Research Council and the agricultural departments.   It is as yet too soon to say whether grass drying may become acommercial proposition, but  it is possible that it may, in  future years, providea most valuable complement  to a campaign for intensive grassland production.Eradication- of Animal Disease.     38.  In any campaign for the eradication of animal diseases, the first diseaseto be tackled is bovine tuberculosis, which has progressively increased  during thepresent century.  It is proposed  that a concentrated attack should now be madeon this disease  in accordance with the plan outlined below,  and that this  shouldbe supplemented by action directed towards  the elimination of contagious abortionin tubercle-free herds. These measures would provide the groundwork for,  andlead naturally to, the adoption  of voluntary measures for the elimination of otherdiseases, such  as mastitis and Johne&apos;s disease, and also of contagious abortionin herds not free from tuberculosis.     39.  There are  already  in existence certain measures  dealing with  bovinetuberculosis.*  These are, however, designed mainly for the protection of publichealth, whereas, the proposals now envisaged approach the subject primarily fromthe point of  view of the improvement of the health of livestock in order to eliminate waste, to increase productivity, and to improve the profitability of the livestock  industry.    The speedy eradication  of tuberculosis  throughout  thecountry is impossible in view of the high incidence of the disease, but much maybe done to reduce its prevalence by the introduction of new measures in  definedareas where there is a comparatively low incidence, and by the gradual extensionof these areas on the lines pursued with success in the United  States, canada and elsewhere.    40.  The only effective method of  eradication is  to proceed by the gradualelimination of animals reacting  to the tuberculin test.  There is no likelihood of achieving the desired result by vaccination.   * The Tuberculosis Order of 1925, made under  the Diseases of Animals Acts, requires localauthorities to slaughter cattle affected with tuberculosis in those  forms most dangerous to human beings and to animals.  The Milk  Act, 1934 (Section 9), empowers the Minister of Agricultureand  the Secretary of State for  Scotland to make  arrangements for securing supplies of milkwhich are pure and free from disease, and in exercise of those powers the Attested Herds scheme shave  been put into force to encourage voluntary efforts of herd  owners  to eradicate tuberculosisfrom  individual herds.  In addition, the Milk (Special Designations) Order of  1936  provides forthe licensing by local authorities of the sale of &quot; tuberculin tested &quot; milk, i.c, milk from herdswhich have passed a clinical veterinary examination and a tuberculin test as well as complying with certain conditions as regards cleanliness,  buildings  and equipment.
    The scheme proposed may be outlined briefly as1 follows :     (1) Routine Clinical Inspection of Herds. It is proposed to carry out aroutine veterinary inspection of all herds producing milk, the inspection takingplace four times a year  in the case  of  herds producing milk not intended  to bepasteurised, and once a  year in the case of herds  from which the milk is  to bepasteurised.  This routine inspection would discover clinical cases of tuberculosisfor immediate disposal;  provide a great deal of information on the incidence ofother diseases; provide the inspection required for licences to produce Tuberculintested and Accredited milk, and establish contacts with farmers and educatethem in the adoption of preventive and remedial measures generally.     (2) Tuberculin Test Survey of Self-contained herds. The herds likely toreveal the lowest  incidence, of tuberculosis are self-contained herds  (i.e.,  thosewhich are maintained by breeding in the herd itself).  A necessary step in theeradication campaign would be  to  ascertain the  herds which  are  free  fromdisease, or nearly  so,  and with this object it is proposed      (a) to locate the  self-contained herds, and     (b) to carry out a tuberculin test survey of them as quickly as practicable.     This survey would take about two years to complete.     (3)  Voluntary Attestation Scheme. The existing voluntary scheme for  theofficial attestation  of individual herds would continue with additional inducementson the lines of the scheme now applicable in Scotland.   The survey referred to inthe previous sub-paragraph  would  disclose many  herds containing  few  or noreactors and the realisation of the state of these herds will induce many owners toproceed with attestation.     (4) Establishment of  Attested  Areas.-It is also proposed  to  inaugurateimmediately  a  four-year plan for the cleaning up of areas  which are known orfound as a result of the Tuberculin Test  Survey to have a comparatively lowincidence of tuberculosis.  The plan could embrace six such areas, each containingabout 1,000 herds  or about 40,000 cattle.  In the areas selected, the plan would, atfirst,  proceed on a voluntary basis until the support of about 75 per cent, of theowners or of the owners of 75 per cent, of the cattle was obtained.   The area  wouldthen be declared a  compulsory area and non-attested herds would be officially  testedand the reactors  destroyed with  payment  of  compensation.  The movement of cattle into the area would be controlled so as to keep it permanently clean.  Theintention would be to develop the plan in subsequent years by the extension  of theclean areas and the selection of other areas for  cleaning-up.     (5)  Other bovine diseases. In carrying out these proposals, a good deal ofinformation would be accumulated on other diseases, and the way thus preparedfor measures to eradicate them.   One of the most serious is contagious abortionand it is proposed to frame a scheme whereby the owners of  all herds which havebeen  officially tested and found to be free from  tuberculosis will be given anopportunity  of obtaining official certification as  to freedom from contagiousabortion  as well.  With this object, facilities would  be  provided for protectingherds which  are now free from contagious abortion and eliminating  the diseasefrom infected herds by free veterinary  advice and  free blood testing, followed bythe voluntary removal or segregation of reactors.  These measures would set  adefinite standard  for other farmers who wish to  eradicate contagious abortionfrom their herds.     (6) Diseases of other farm animals. The steps proposed in relation to cattlediseases and the contacts that would thereby be made by Veterinary Officers withfarmers generally would, in association with their effects, have valuable results inleading farmers  to  appreciate and make increased use  of  the advances  inveterinary science in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases among sheep,  swineand horses on the farm.     (7) Poultry  Diseases. Recent  legislation has., safeguarded  poultry  flocksfrom the risk of the  introduction of  serious diseases from abroad,  and will assist in checking the spread of the more common diseases by requiring the disinfectionof poultry market pens and of receptacles used for the conveyance of poultry. Theproblem of the heavy mortality among poultry  is under examination by an expert committee and pending the receipt of their recommendations, the proposals  underthis  head are limited to the encouragement  and development of the existingAccredited Poultry Breeding Stations Scheme which aims  at providing poultry
keepers with a reliable source from which to obtain healthy stock.  It is proposedthat such encouragement should take the form of  free services at the Ministry&apos;sVeterinary Laboratory at Weybridge,  and as regards Scotland probably at alaboratory at Edinburgh  to all station holders in regard to inspection,  blood-testing and post mortem examinations.     (8)  Centralised  Veterinary  Service. The Ministry of  Agriculture  andFisheries are of opinion  that it would not be possible to obtain the necessaryresults from such a campaign as is outlined above  without a complete centralisation-$ion of existing veterinary services.  These services are at present provided  partly by  the  Ministry of Agriculture (and  by the Department of  Agriculture forScotland so far  as the administration of the Scottish Attested Herds Scheme isconcerned) and partly by Local Authorities.  For some time Local Authoritieshave  been asking for  special  grants  from  the Exchequer  to  enable them todischarge their existing duties under the Diseases  of Animals Acts and the milk and Dairies Acts and Orders:   On the other hand, it  is increasingly evident thatthe attainment of uniform standards of control and inspection  so important tothe success of any comprehensive policy, is impossible under present conditions,which give rise  to serious differences in the interpretation of the regulations by so many different  authorities and the attention given to their enforcement.  Itis, therefore, proposed that the State should take over the veterinary duties (and staff) of Local Authorities, other than any relating to meat inspection, and thatthere should be established a centralised veterinary service.   The Ministry ofAgriculture and Fisheries think that this service should be in respect of the wholeof Great Britain.     There would probably be some objection to this course from Local Authorities.In this connection, the Ministry of Health have been consulted and have expressedthe view that the present proposals  are on the right  lines.  They think that theLocal Authorities will  by no means be unanimous in their opposition, and thatthe attitude of many of them will be influenced by the consideration that theywill be  relieved  of expenditure.  The Department of Health  for Scotland, how-ever, see a number of objections to a centralised service, particularly a single one for Great Britain, and to  the withdrawal of veterinary duties  from Scottish localauthorities.Cost of the Campaign.     41.   The cost of the scheme outlined above in  the first four years would be asfollows :       The Tuberculin Test survey of self-contained herds  would, it is estimated,cost  250,000  spread over two years.   The establishment of a State VeterinaryService would involve the employment by the Ministry of  Agriculture of a whole time staff of 550 veterinarians (compared with a present staff of 100) and would cost in  salaries, travelling, accommodation,  equipment, and  clerical  assistance,about   550,000 per  annum (or  an  additional charge  of  about   400,000 perannum);  but this would be off-set by a saving of  about  170,000 in the presentcharges incurred by Local Authorities for their existing veterinary services. Thisfull staff could not be acquired immediately, although about half of it would be atonce available from the present whole-time veterinary staff of the Ministry  and ofLocal Authorities.  There would be very little increase in the cost of compensationfor cattle slaughtered compulsorily by the State under the existing TuberculosisOrder of 1925,  which at present amounts to about   80,000 per annum.   Thequestion of reducing the rate of compensation could, in fact,  now be considered.The cost of cleaning of six areas would amount to about  350,000 spread over fouryears.  In addition, the proposed measures  for testing for contagious abortionwould cost about  50,000 spread over  four years, and those  in  connection withpoultry disease  25,000 covering the same period.     42.   The continuation of the  Attested Herds  Scheme would involve anextension of the provisions in Section 9 of the Milk Act for a further two years.The sum required for this scheme  over the four-year  period  is estimated at 700,000, the residue of  the Exchequer grant  of  750,000  refeiTed  to in that section.     43.   To summmarise these figures, the present authorised expenditure onveterinary services and attested herd schemes, including the  170,000 borne by
Local Authorities, is about  570,000 per annum.  The total cost of the proposed scheme  would involve  an additional  430,000 per annum, making a total  of 1,000,000 per annum  for four years, although the individual amounts spent inany year might vary considerably from that figure.    44.  The  expenditure on the scheme of eradication at the end of the four-years&apos; programme would depend to a certain extent on the progress which wasmade in that period, but a State Veterinary Service, involving an  annual  chargeof  550,000 (as against present cost of  150,000 borne by the State and  170,000by local authorities), would probably be permanently required having regard tothe normal development of the attested area scheme of tuberculosis  eradication.

INTER-DEPARTMENTAL  COMMITTEE  ON  INCREASING  THE                    PRODUCTIVITY OF  THE  SOIL. (Confidential.) SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT ON THE QUESTION  OF ASSISTANCE FOR OATS AND BARLEY.     IN their main  Report the Committee have proposed  an amendment of the &quot;Wheat Act that would tend to encourage the growing of a larger area of wheat in this country.  In the Committee&apos;s discussion of this subject the Scottish represen- tatives expressed the  view that if  this proposal were  announced without  any proposal for a subsidy on oats, grave dissatisfaction would be created  amongst oat  growers in Scotland, who have  for some  time been urging the Government to  assist  them.   These  oat  growers  have  complained  that some  assistance comparable to that  given to wheat  growers should  be.given to them, and their dissatisfaction would  be greatly increased if further  assistance  were given to wheat and  nothing  to oats.  The Scottish representatives, therefore, while not objecting to the wheat proposal in itself, considered that it was politically essential that it should be coupled with some assistance to oat growers.     2.   The further assistance proposed for wheat growers presents no difficulties. There is a workable scheme already in existence.   The necessary  amendment to the Wheat Act would he a simple one; it would involve no change  in administra- tion and no charge on the Exchequer; and it would have an insignificant effect on the price of &quot;flour.*   A  scheme for  assisting  oat  growers presents considerable difficulties.                 I. PREVIOUS EXAMINATION  OF THE SUBJECT.     3.   The question  of devising a satisfactory  scheme for the  payment  of  a subsidy  to oat growers (and, latterly, to barley growers as well)  was under the consideration of the  Agricultural Departments for about a year from the  Autumn of 1935 to the Autumn of  1936.  The  object  at that time  was to provide some assistance to those growers of  oats,  particularly in the North-East of Scotland, who were in financial difficulties because they sell a considerable proportion of the oats produced instead of feeding it to their livestock, and because the market price of oats was  low.  It was considered, however, that assistance could not be confined to any particular area, and also that if assistance, at least in England and Wales, were  given for oats, it  would be difficult to decline  assistance for barley also.   The question was  not considered from the point of view of national defence.  Briefly, the conclusion then reached was that a subsidy scheme for oats and barley was administratively practicable though it would have to  be paid on an acreage basis, which is open  to some objection.  A subsidy at the moderate rate of 15s. per acre on oats and barley (equivalent to about Is. per cwt. on the crop) would have cost about  2^  million per annum if  there had been  no increase in acreage.  The question of the method of raising this sum proved  difficult.  The alternatives to a direct grant from the  Exchequer, viz., a levy on  imported oats and barley  and an  increase in the  levy on flour  under the Wheat Act and a reduction in the deficiency payment to wheat growers, with the object of making the money available  for oats and barley, are all open to considerable objection; moreover, they must  be used in combination in order to provide sufficient funds. Failing some such arrangement any scheme for assistance to growers of oats and barley would have to be financed by a direct grant from  the  Exchequer.  The Agricultural Ministers did not feel justified at that time in asking that a grant from the Exchequer  should  be made  available. Earlier Scheme now  Inappropriate.    4.  Subsequent  events  have  shown that  the only  scheme that was then considered practicable would now be quite inappropriate seeing  that since  the Autumn of 1936 there  has been a considerable rise in the price of  both oats and barley; consequently, a subsidy at present prices would be unjustified, and, indeed,
 is not being demanded.  Oat growers are now asking not for an immediate subsidy but for some guarantee that the present satisfactory prices will be continued; they desire a scheme that would insure them against a recurrence in the future of the very low prices which prevailed a year ago.  This, they claim,  would enable them to plan ahead with  confidence and  would, at any rate, maintain the  existing oat acreage, even if it did not increase it.  Considerations of national defence have led to the re-examination by  the Inter-departmental  Committee of the question of assistance to growers of oats and  barley from this point of view.     5.   Before dealing with the national defence aspects of the matter it will be convenient to give particulars of the previous examination of the subject. General Considerations in regard to  Oats.     6.   So far as oats are concerned, the United Kingdom is practically self- supporting.  Ninety-three per cent, of the total supply of oats is home-grown;  the remaining 7 per cent, is imported from Canada.   There is a prohibitive Customs duty on oats imported from foreign  countries.  Most home-grown wheat is sold off the farm.  In the case of barley  and oats, a large proportion of the crop is  fed to livestock,  and in  the case of oats a relatively large proportion is  used on  the farm on which it is grown.*  The demand for assistance to oat growers has come from Scotland.  There has been no demand for assistance from oat growers in England and Wales, though if a scheme were introduced all oat growers would certainly claim to be included.  The part of Scotland mainly concerned is  the North-East, where 40 per  cent, of  the total oat acreage  of Scotland lies, where a&apos;  substantial proportion  of the oats grown is sold  off  the farms, and where conditions are unsuitable  for  growing either wheat or barley. A  Subsidy on Sales.    7.   The objection to assistance on the basis of the quantity of oats actually sold is that farmers who now feed oats to their own livestock would be induced to sell their oats in order to secure the  subsidy;  they would either buy back other oats or would purchase other feeding-stuffs, chiefly maize.  This would lead to a great deal of wasteful transport of  oats and might depress the market price. A  Subsidy on Production.    8.   The objection to assistance on the basis of the quantity of oats produced is  that there is no  satisfactory method of assessing the quantity of the crop produced for the purpose of the payment of subsidy.A  Subsidy on Acreage.    9.  The only  practicable  basis of  payment  on oats is,  therefore, that  ofacreage.  This method is, however,  open to the objection that it takes no accountof- the quantity or quality of the crop produced and that  the full rate of subsidy would, in practice, be payable on a  poor crop as well as on a good one.  It wouldbe impossible to inspect all land in respect of which claims for subsidy were made,but test inspections could be made on a portion of the area. Basic Acreage.    10.  The demand for oats has for many years been declining mainly owing to the  reduction  in the  number  of horses,  though  to  some extent  owing  tothe competition of cheap  maize.  The  acreage has  declined considerably in  thelast ten years.  If, therefore, a subsidy scheme resulted in increased  production, the effect would be to reduce prices, and some, or all,  of the benefit of &amp;, flat-ratesubsidy would be lost.  It was, therefore, considered essential that, if the growersin the then distressed oat area in the  North-East of Scotland were  to receive  the full benefit of the  subsidy,  some check on increased production  should be devised. It was accordingly suggested during the 1935-36 inquiry that the acreage to rank for oat subsidy on any farm should be the acreage actually sown to oats in  the year of claim, provided that that area did not exceed a basic acreage allotted to that farm, which should be, say, the average acreage under oats on that farm in    * It was estimated some years  ago that  in Scotland some 45 per cent,  of oats is  sold off the farm;  but in England-and Wales the figure is estimated at only  20 per cent.
1934, 1935 and 1936.  It was pointed out that this provision for a basic acreagemight have the result that the benefits would accrue only to the present owners.and pccupiers pf farms eligible for  subsidy, and that the  benefit of the scheme would, fo a large extent, pass to the owner on a change of tenancy.Exclusion of  Wheat Growers.     11.  With a view to restricting the benefits of the subsidy to those growersof oats and barley who were most in need of it, a proposal was considered thatthe subsidy should be confined to those growers who did not receive any benefit from the wheat subsidy.  This proposal would have had the additional advantage that it would have reduced the total cost.  But to restrict the subsidy in this way would lead to the criticism that the subsidy was being paid to a certain classof farmers not because they were producing a particular crop, the production ofwhich was considered essential in the  national interest, but because they werenot receiving any share of Government subsidies paid on other commodities.   Itwas  considered that if such a restriction were proposed there might be  difficultyin adhering to it.Desirability of Limiting Production.     12.  It was concluded that some limitation  on  an increase  in  production would be essential, in order to limit the cost of the subsidy, and in order to preventthe scheme from causing a fall in the market price that would have counteractedits advantages.   It was considered that some method of limitation would also benecessary in  the case of barley.  This principle of limitation is included in thewheat and sugar beet subsidy schemes, partly  to limit the cost  and  partly toprevent the extension of the crops to unsuitable land.  It is also included in the cattle  subsidy scheme, in which  assistance is  limited  to  a total   figure  of 5 million per annum.                        II. THE  PRESENT PROBLEM.Considerations of National Defence.     13.   When the matter is considered from the point  of  view of nationaldefence, however, which is the task of the present Inter-Departmental Committee,the  aspect is entirely  different.  Here  it becomes a question not of limitingproduction, but of increasing it.  Both oats and barley are important foodstuffsfor animals, and both can be used to some extent in increased quantities for humanfoodstuffs  in  time  of  war.  Leaving grass  and hay  out  of consideration, theUnited Kingdom is dependent on imports of animal feeding-stuffs to the extentof over 40 per cent, of the total supplies.  If these oversea supplies were  restrictedin time of war, increased supplies of home-grown oats and barley would be very useful to make up the&apos;deficiency.  Moreover, in many parts  of the country, oatsis the only cereal crop for which the climate is suitable, and if  productivity is tobe increased  by the encouragement of cereal growing,  a subsidy on oats appearsto be the complement of a subsidy on wheat.   The case for assisting Scottish oatgrowers on defence grounds is that in the absence of  an assured return for oats,particularly  in those districts where a  considerable  quantity  is sold as a cashcrop, land may be allowed to revert to rough grazings (as, indeed, it has  been) andthere is no sufficient incentive to bring it back into cultivation.Standard Price.     14.   It has already been stated that the payment of subsidies on a flat ratebasis of  so much an acre  would be  inappropriate, in view of  the fact that thepresent price is  satisfactory.  A scheme at the present time would have to bebased on the principle of a standard price.  At the time when the flat rate subsidywas considered, prices were much lower than they are now;  the rise in prices thathas  occurred in  the last few  months was  unforeseen, and  any standard price that. would have been regarded by growers as  satisfactory  would have beenconsidered to be impracticable at that time on grounds of  expense.  The changein the price  situation is illustrated by the following table showing the presentaverage  prices  of oats in England and Wales  and in  Scotland  respectively,compared with the prices in the corresponding weeks of previous years.

The first question that arises in connection with the standard price is what the price should  be.   If it were fixed on the low side so  as  to limit theliability of the Exchequer by providing for low payments and not  encouragingan  increase in production, the scheme  would  merely cause irritation amongstgrowers.  If, however,  it were fixed  too high,  it  might  encourage increased production that would  involve a considerable fall  in the market  price and thusincrease the charge on  the Exchequer.  Indeed, a consideration of this question from the point of view of national defence leads to a dilemma. On the one hand.on grounds of defence it is desirable to increase production; on the other hand,in time of peace increased production of oats is embarrassing, seeing that it will lead to a fall in price.   Even if the increased supplies were purchased by theGovernment for storage these  purchases could  not go on  indefinitely, and whenthey ceased there  would be a surplus on the market. Reference  is made in theCommittee&apos;s main report to the undesirability of introducing measures that wouldstimulate production to a pitch that might leave the Government faced at some later date with  the difficulty of liquidating an artificial  situation.   It  is very important, therefore, to avoid fixing the standard price  too high..  It is essentialto avoid a repetition of the experience of the Corn Production Acts.     16.  In the opinion of the Scottish growers a remunerative  price for oatswould be about  85.  per cwt.   The Department  of Agriculture for  Scotlandconsider that a guaranteed price of this amount would  stimulate  the productionand sale of oats to a point far beyond the capacity of the market, and that thiswould result in so low a price as to  involve  a  very large total of  deficiency round. They consider that a figure of 6s. 6d. would be regarded by the growersas unreasonably low, and that it would  not be likely to  increase or  even to-maintain* production;  on the other hand,  they  consider that if any figure of theorder of 7s. Qd. (or even 7s.) were taken, devices would have to be adopted to limit the call upon State funds arising from a large increase in the production and saleof oats, accompanied in all likelihood by a  sharp drop in prices.Limitation of Production.     17.  To overcome this difficulty, the Department of Agriculture for Scotlandconsider that it would be necessary  to put some limit on the total production of oats covered by the scheme, and that this could be done by allotting to each farma maximum qualifying acreage based either (a) on a recent average of three orfour years, or (6) on some peak figure attained on the farm in that period.  they recognise that, from the point of view of those farmers who have been most seriously hit  by  low prices and who have  lost most ground  in recent years, thisis by no means a satisfactory proposition,  but,  for the country as a  whole,individual returns of acreage are no longer available for  more than the past threeyears;  and, in any case, a scheme  involving an examination of  returns  over aconsiderable  period would present  serious administrative difficulties.    In  thecircumstances, the best that could be done, if it  were desired to aim at a slightlygreater increase of production than could be obtained  by taking recent  figures would be to allow a small percentage increase over those figures, which would haveto be of a general  application.    * The other representatives on the Committee consider that the present acreage  would bemaintained even if no assistance were given.
The Defence Dilemma.     18.  This suggestion leads to  the defence dilemma.  If  the  scheme were announced as part of a national defence programme, it  would be difficult  tojustify these checks on increased production.  On the other hand, it is essentialthat some limit should be put on the liability of the Exchequer.  It was for this latter reason that  a standard price was rejected when the question of the basisof payment of the fat cattle subsidy was under consideration, in spite of  very strong representations in favour of  a standard price that  were made  by theNational Farmers&apos; Union in England and  Wales and in  Scotland.  It is  truethat the wheat  subsidy  is based on the principle of  the standard price  anddeficiency payments,  but in that case there is no liability on the Exchequer; thenecessary funds  are provided by a levy on flour, the amount of  which is greatestwhen the consumer of flour who has  to pay the levy  is enjoying the greatestbenefit from low prices.  Indeed, as the price of wheat falls and the levy on flourincreases, the consumer benefits to the extent of four-fifths of the fall in price, andis only called upon to sacrifice the benefit of one-fifth of the fall for the purposeof assisting the home wheat grower.The Average Market Price.     19.  But this is not the only difficulty in regard to the fixing of a satisfactorystandard price for oats.  Under the  system  of a standard price and deficiency round,  the subsidy received  by  each individual grower is  not  based  on thedifference between  the standard price and the sale price received by that grower.Such,an arrangement would encourage bogus sales at low prices  in order to obtain a high rate of subsidy; at best it would provide  no inducement to the grower toobtain the best price he could  for  his crops.  To overcome  this objection  it isnecessary to provide that the amount of subsidy payable  shall be equal to thedifference between the standard price and the average market price of a largenumber of sales  such as  the average for the whole year throughout the country.Under this arrangement the rate of subsidy  received by all growers is the sameregardless of  the  sale price received by the individual.   This system presentspeculiar difficulties when applied to the  growers of oats  in the North-East  ofScotland.   This  area is a low-price area for  oats. The average market price  inthis area  is usually about Is. per cwt. below the average price in  Glasgow and edinburgh.  The average market price of oats in the five principal markets  ofScotland, namely, Aberdeen, Montrose, Perth, Glasgow and Edinburgh is usuallylower than the  average market price  throughout England  and Wales.   Thisrelatively low price in  Aberdeenshire is an  element  in  the  case for  special assistance to that area.   But a deficiency payment based on a standard price andan average price for the whole of Great Britain would, as has been stated, givethe same rate of  subsidy to everybody and to every area regardless of need.Regional and County Average Prices.     20.  To overcome this difficulty the Department of Agriculture for Scotlandpropose that the deficiency payments should be  based on local average prices.  Itis suggested that in  Scotland.the fiar&apos;s prices  should be taken; these prices arestruck in each county in the Spring by the fiar&apos;s court.  In England and wales the only local data are the average prices at representative markets throughoutthe country calculated under the Corn returns   Acts.  It would  not be possible  to calculate average prices in each county from these data; but it  would be possibleto calculate averages for the agricultural divisions, of which  there are  10 for england and Wales.  This arrangement has  the merit  that it would provide forthe payment of  the highest subsidy where assistance is said  to be most needed;consequently, it.  would be possible to provide adequate assistance for Aberdeen-shire at a much  lower  cost for the country as a whole than would be the  case  ifthere were  only one  average  sale  price.  On political grounds, however, thearrangement seems to be open to considerable objection.  Over large parts of thecountry the standard price would be regarded as too low.  The growers in those areas would ask why little or no assistance was being given to  them.  A scheme that confined most of the benefit to one comparatively small area of the .country might be  justified on  the  ground that special assistance  was necessary for adepressed area,  but it would be difficult to justify on  the grounds of  nationaldefence as part of  a policy aimed at increasing agricultural production through-out the whole country.
 Limitation by reference to Sales.     21.   With a view to limiting the subsidy as far as possible to actual sales of oats the Department of Agriculture  for Scotland propose  that the  subsidy should, if possible, be limited to the proportion of oats sold off the farm.  This proportion varies very considerably in different parts of the country.  As  already stated it  is estimated that for Scotland as a whole some 45 per cent, of the oats grown is normally sold off the farm; in England and Wales the percentage is estimated to be 20; in Northern Ireland  it is negligible.   The proportion varies from farm  to farm,  both in Scotland  and in  England  and Wales, but  for administrative reasons it would be impossible to calculate the sales proportion for each farm.  The Department of Agriculture for Scotland, therefore, propose that it  should  be presumed that a certain quantity of oats per acre is sold off. They suggest that the scheme should prescribe  a proportion either  for each county  or for  other units of areas.  They  are, however, doubtful whether an equitable delimitation of areas would be  feasible or whether the result would be acceptable to farmers  whose normal proportion of oats  sold is  substantially higher than the area average.  On the other hand, they point out that a, scheme submitted by the National Farmers&apos; Union of Scotland in 1934 provided  for a subsidy being paid on the  basis of a flat  50  per cent, of average j^roduction per acre, on the ground that this roughly represented the proportion of oats  sold off the farm in Scotland  as a whole.  The other representatives on the Committee are opposed to this proposal on the ground that the proportion of oats sold varies from farm to farm, and that an average figure was, therefore, not appropriate. Estimates of Cost.    22.   It is  very  difficult to give  an  estimate of the  cost  of  a scheme  for subsidising oats on the basis of a standard price.   Everything  would depend on the terms of the scheme that was adopted.  The factors that could  be controlled are the level of the  standard price,  the total acreage and the  quantity  of oats per acre that would be eligible for subsidy, and the  area for which the average sale price was to be calculated.   Decisions in regard to each of these factors involve the difficulties that have been described.   The factor that is beyond control is the future course of market prices, which would be determined largely by world causesif the home production were limited in the scheme.  The present price of cereals is due to the unfavourable conditions in North America during the last few years, and in Europe last year.  The return of more normal conditions this year would almost certainly cause a fall  in  the price from the present level.   To take  theprobable maximum liability, if the subsidy  were based on a standard price of7s. Qd. per cwt. for Great Britain with an&apos;ayerage market price of 5s. for Great Britain and payment were made in respect of the whole crop produced, i.e., on an acreage basis at the rate of 16 cwts.1 per acre,&quot; which is the average  yield,  the total cost in the United Kingdom would amount to  5 million  per annum on the existing  acreage.  If an  average of  5 cwts.  per acre were assumed  as  the proportion sold off  farms and the total  acreage qualifying  for  subsidy were 2,700,000 (i.e.,  allowing for an increase of about 200,000  acres), the cost would amount to  1,700,000.  The objections ,tp these limitations have been described.Conclusion.    23.   It appears that unless  the  scheme could be confined to the North-East of Scotland the cost would be  out of  all proportion to any increased productivity that could be expected, from the  scheme.  Indeed  in the opinion of the majority of the &quot;Committee it is impossible, for the reasons described, to  devise  a  satis- f satisfactory scheme for a subsidy on oats based on grounds of National defence wliich as not bound to be embarrassing in times bf peace.                                    Barley.     24.   If a subsidy scheme were adopted for oats there would be an irresistible demand for  a  subsidy  on  barley also. Barley growers have been pressing  for Government assistance  for the past 15 years.   Here, the greatest pressure comes from England.  Just as there are areas  in Scotland where the only cereal that can be satisfactorily grown is oats, so in England there are areas that are suitable only for  barley; these are the light barley  lands;  they  constitute one of  the &quot; black spots &quot; of agriculture in England at the  present time.
General Considerations in regard to Barley.    25.  Considerations in regard to barley differ materially from those in regardto oats though  the  difficulties  of devising  a satisfactory subsidy scheme are probably as great.  Whereas in the case of oats the home production constitutesover 90 per cent, of  the total supply, in the  case of barley the home productionamounts to about 50 per  cent.  About 55 per cent, of the home  barley crop is used for brewing and distilling; the rest is used for seed and for feeding to live-stock, chiefly pigs.  About 75 per cent, of the imported barley is used for feeding.For malting purposes barley must be of good quality; consequently  malting barleycommands  a much higher price  than barley used for feeding.  Quality is deter-mined by soil, season, variety, manuring, position in rotation, time of sowing and time of threshing.  Of these factors the most important are soil and season.Decline in Demand for Malting and Distilling Barley.    26.  Up to the last two or three years the demand for malting and distillingbarley has been declining owing  to the decline  in the  production  of beer andspirits.   This is  probably the main cause of the  difficulties of barley growerssince  the War and the consequent decline in  acreage that has taken  place.Imported Barley.    27..  Barley growers  have for many years complained of  competition  fromimported barley.   There  has been a considerable increase in imports from thelow figure  of  1932 but imports  are still below the pre-war level.   Moreover, as has been stated,  the hulk of the imports  consists of feeding barley and ourlivestock farmers desire  cheap imported barley for feeding-stuffs.  There is,therefore, a sharp conflict  of interest between  the growers of barley  in this country.and the farmers  who use barley  for feeding tto their stock.  This conflict hasprevented the National Farmers&apos; Union of England and Wales from applying&apos;forincreased Customs duties  on all imported barley  (the present rate  is 10 per cent.on foreign barley only).   They have had no difficulty, however, in pressing forprotective  duties on imported malting harley only.   But a differential customs duty on imported malting barley presents very great administrative difficulties,seeing that in respect of barley of medium quality it is impossible to determinewhen the barley is imported whether it will  he used for malting or for feeding.Moreover, most of the imported barley used for malting  has special qualities notpossessed  by  home-grown barley, and brewers  say that  they must  have  thisimported barley,  whatever its price,  to mix with home-grown and to produceparticular  types of beer.  In short, the demand  for malting barley is inelastic.A duty on malting barley, therefore, even if it were  feasible,  would have  to bevery high  if it were to have much protective effect.  On the other  hand, thedemand for feeding barley is comparatively elastic and an increase of duty might reduce imports  considerably.  In the circumstances the protection  of barleygrowers by means of Customs duties has not been considered practicable, nor isbarley suitable for the application of  the levy subsidy system.The Gentlemen&apos;s A grcement.    28.  The only  practicable  method of  assisting barley growers  that has emerged from the exhaustive consideration  that has been given  to it since theWar is an agreement by  the brewers  and distillers that they  will use as muchhome-grown  barley  as  possible.   The  Brewers&apos; Society made what has  been described as a Gentlemen&apos;s Agreement with  the  Chancellor of  the Exchequer tothis effect in 1933 when the beer duty Avas reduced.,  The Brewers&apos; Society statedin a letter  to the Chancellor that, &apos;&apos; in order to give the maximum assistance toBritish agriculture, the Society will recommend all brewers to increase as far aspossible the  proportion  of  home-grown  barley  in the brewing  of all  classesof beer.&quot;    29.  In December 1934 the National Farmers&apos; Union of England and Walessubmitted  an application to the Import Duties  Advisory Committee for anincreased  duty on malting barley only.   The Scottish Chamber of  Agricultureabout the same time submitted an application for an import duty on  all importedbarley from foreign countries.  After prolonged consideration of the subject and consultation with the representatives of  the farmers&apos; organisations and of the
Brewers and  Distillers, the Import Duties Advisory Committee came to the-conclusion  that the best  method of  dealing with the matter was to continuethe Gentlemen&apos;s Agreement in a more precise form.  It was recognised  that the brewers had been compelled to purchase a certain proportion of imported barleyto maintain the special quality of their beers.   The  Import Duties AdvisoryCommittee received an assurance  from the Brewers&apos;  Society that  it  was theintention of its members collectively to make every effort to purchase in each yeara minimum quantity of home-grown  barley amounting to  7,500,000 cwt., and toincrease their purchases pari passu with any increase in the production of beerover the production in the  year ended the 30th September, 1935.  The ImportDuties  Advisory Committee regard. this quantity of  7,500,000  cwt., which isestimated to be the equivalent of sonm seven-tenths of the total quantity of barleyused for brewing purposes,  as satisfactory in all the circumstances.   An agree-ment on similar lines  was  obtained from the  distillers.  The  Import duties advisory Committee stated  that so  long as they remained satisfied that  these undertakings were being carried out they intended to regard the applications forincreased duties as in suspense.A  Subsidy  for Barley.    30.  A subsidy for barley in the interests of national defence presents manyof the difficulties  associated with  a subsidy  on oats which have already beendiscussed at length.  Any subsidy that increased the production of malting barleyappreciably would have embarrassing results, owing  to the inelastic demand formalting barley.  Unless the consumption of beer continues to increase, the demand from the brewers will be limited; when that demand is satisfied the only  outlet isfor feeding, and the price received for this purpose  is relatively low.  Under anational standard price %ad a national  average market price all producers would receive the same rate of subsidy, but  it is doubtful whether the producers of thebest quality malting barley  in the areas most suitable for  the production of thiscrop are in need of assistance.   On the other  hand,  the difficulties of confiningthe subsidy to barley sold  for feeding are very great.  There is no definite line of demarcation between malting barley  and feeding barley, and it  would  be prac-tically impossible to track the barley down to ensure that it was actually  used forfeeding.  There is the additional  objection that it would be very difficult tojustify paying a subsidy only on barley of inferior quality.    Ministry  of Agriculture and Fisheries,            April 21, 1937.
