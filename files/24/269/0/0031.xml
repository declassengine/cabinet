(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITUANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)oE C R Copy NO                 C A 3 I N E To       INTSPJsTATIONAL SUGAR CONI^ENCE.,Memorandum &quot;by- the hord President of.the Councile.       As has been announced in the Press, the InternationalSugar Conference has reached agreement in principle on ascheme for the regulation of the free market, and mycolleagues may be interested to have, for their confidential information, some particulars  of the position.,Conference had before it a Report of the Negotiating Committee,of which I attach a copy, and agreed that this should serve as a basis for the drafting of a definite agreement.,two groupso   The first section deals with the measures to betaken by countries not exporting to.the free market with aview to maintaining the free market requirementso   Under this head fall undertakings by the United States and the BritishEmpire to maintain the ratio of their imports from foreigncountries by limiting their production or exports0  the undertakings suggested represent what, in fact, eachDelegation has offered to do as its contribution to anAt the Plenary Meeting on the 27th April theThe proposals of the Negotiating Committee fall into-1-
agreement..  In the case of the United Kingdom,  we  would undertaketo maintain in operation our present legislation controllingsugar production., subject to our right,  should we  think  fit,to increase our maximum production by a  proportion (fixed at18. 6 per cent) of any increase in future consumption of  Empireimporting countries.  (This proportion represents  the percentagewhich United Kingdom production at present bears to Empireconsumption).  In the case of the Colonies, the assurance wouldbe that total exports should be limited  to a basic figure of950,000 long tons, subject to a similar  right to a share  in any increase of Empire consumption.  The Dominions and colonies would be entitled to 47o 4 per Cent, of  future increases  of consumption, the distribution of this share between the colonies and Australia and South  Africa being a  matter for settlement between them.  In addition, to. meet the  apprehensions felt by  theColonial Office as to the position of the Colonies, we havereserved the right,  if in fact we do not increase  the maxhnumUnited Kingdom production by the amount  of its share in  any increase of consumption, to add this share of increased Empireconsumption to the Colonial quota.  (This reservation does not commit the Government to acting upon it f  the Government will haveto decide each year  whether in fact,  to  increase  the UnitedKingdom production  or the  Colonial  quota,  or  to let the UnitedKingdom share  of  the increase  of  consumpxion  be met out of the free market)       These several undertakings are set out in Schedule Iattached to the Negotiating Committee&apos;s  Report. At the Conferencecertain Delegations reserved their opinion as to whether  the assurances given in this Schedule were adequate?  but it  isunderstood that their difficulties relate rather to the  assurancesproposed in the case of the United States and the  Philippines  than to the assurances proposed as regards the British  Empire.       The other section of the Negotiating Committee&apos;s Reportdeals with the allocation of export quotas to the  free marketamong the foreign exporting countries.
The proposals of the Negotiating Committee under  this head have been the result of prolonged discussion,  andgreat difficulty was experienced particularly inadjusting the claims of Czeoho-Slovakia and  Russia.Finally, agreement was reached on a scheme set out  inSchedule II of the Negotiating Committee&apos;s report which&apos;would give total basic quotas, of 3,570,000  metric tons, and quotas for the year 1937/38 of 3,511,000  tons.This figure was substantially in excess of the estimateof free market requirements which was put at -3,500,000tons, but the discrepancy is not so great as would  appear.In the first place, the estimate of 3,300,000 tons for the free market requirements is a conservative  estimateand it is not improbable that the actual requirementsof the free market, given a continuance of the presenttrend of trade, will be 3,400,000 and it is  possiblethat it will be even 5,500,000 tons.  On the other  hand,a part of the quotas allocated to the European countries may not in fact be used during the next year.  Takingthese various factors into consideration, the negotiating committee felt that the quotas proposed could be regardedas in reasonable relation to the free marketpossibilities, provided that during the.next two years a general all-round cut, not exceeding 5 per cent., couldbe required in the basic export quotas if such a cut wasconsidered necessary.  This would enable the quotas tobe reduced by 180,000 tons and bring exports reasonablyclose to the estimate of free market requirements.   TheConference accepted this part of the Committee&apos;s Reportwithout any qualification.       The scheme outlined above may be criticised from two angles.  On the one hand, it may be said that it will
                                                       hi (-J inot lead to any very substantial improvement in themarket position such as would justify the reductionwhich we have undertaken to make in our Colonialproduction.  On the other hand, it may be said that thearrangement will create an artificial scarcity of animportant and popular food, and will thus tend to further increase the cost of Iviing.  In fact, I think that neither criticism can be substantiated and the two moreor less cancel out.  It is improbable that a regulationscheme on the lines suggested will raise prices to thefull extent that some producers would like to see; butit was never our intention to push up prices excessively.What we wanted was to give some stability to the marketwithout an excessive rise in prices and this should besecured by an agreement on the lines proposed.  In anycase, the alternative would have been to have no agreement at all and (apart from the political reper-cussions) failure to reach agreement would almost certainly have provoked a very substantial fall in the world priceof sugar, which would not have been in the interests ofany of the producers.  The above answer to the producers&apos;criticisms meets to some extent the criticisms of theconsumer; but we shall have to see that the position issafeguarded in the future and that we will have a fairvoice in any decision as to whether - quotas should bereduced or increased.       A Drafting Committee is now sitting to work out  adefinite agreement on this basis.  A great many questionsof detail - some of them of considerable importance -remain to be settled, e.g. what peraament organisation  shouldbe set up to control the operation of the scheme CJ
9 9 9,h h Othe allocation of voting power, what sanctions can be  imposed against countries which either fail toohserve the agreement or refuse to accede to it, etc.;hut I am doing my best to expedite the work and I amhopeful that a definite agreement may he concluded andsigned about the middle of next week.(intld) J .R.M.Privy Council Office,    30th April, 1937.
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                         Conf./Sugar/Neg. 25.                      INTERNATIONAL SUGAR CONFERENCE.                           . London, April 1957                                            London, April 27th 1937.                          NEGOTIATING COMMITTEE.                       Summary- of Recommendations.          In their Report of the 19th April (Conf ./S\igar/Weg.20) the negotiating Committee submitted proposals for the regulation of theFree Market in sugar.   These proposals were modified &quot;by theirsupplementary Report on the 24th April (Conf ./Sugar/Neg. 22) and bythe further amendments agreed at the meeting of the Committee, with.Heads of Delegations on the 26th of April,          The modified proposals fall under two heads: first, measuresto &quot;be taken to maintain the free market by countries which areimporters, self-sufficient or exporters only to preferential markets;and secondly, the limitation of exports to the free market &quot;by countrieswhich are actual or potential exporters to that market, in accordancewith a system of quotas to be established by an Agreement.   Theseproposals are set out in the annexed Schedules I and II respectively.     2.   The Committee based their original proposals on the assumption .that the aggregate effective export quotas might have to be limited inthe first year 1937/38 to an amount of 3,300,000 metric tons, being theminimum at which the free market requirements might, on a conservative estimate, be put.   On further consideration they have come to  theconclusion that this estimate, which, as stated, was intended to beconservative, was unduly low.   Having regard to the general  improvementin trade, etc. they think the circumstances justify a more liberalallowance for the future requirements of the market and that  anestimate somewhat in excess of 3,300,000 metric tons might reasonably be adopted.   The Committee also believe that, in addition to the
amounts which certain countries have already undertaken not toutilize from, their quotas in the first year., considerable furtheramounts, particularly of the quotas allotted to beet sugar producing countries; will not in&apos;fact &quot;be exported during the first year.Consequently 5 they believe that the difference &quot;between the amountthat would be exported with the quotas finally proposed and theactual free market requirements will probably not exceed 150,000metric tons.   This gap could be completely closed if a cut ofapproximately 4- per cent was made on the proposed quotas, i.e. a cut of less than the maximum of 5% which it is proposed that the council or other &quot;body set up to control the operation of the Agreement shouldbe empowered to make for 1937/38 or 1938/39,     3.   As to the second year it is reasonable to assume afurther increase of consumption and it is hoped that it will bepossible in due course for some of the beet sugar countries to give notice of the release of parts of their quotas, as for 1937/38, sothat a cut within the maximum of 5% should again be sufficient toreduce quotas to a figure approximating to the actual requirements ofthe market.   After the second year it appears to the Committeereasonable to hope that the increase of consumption and otherdevelopments should be. -suft^Lcient to bring the requirements of themarket practically up to the total fxgure^of&quot;&quot;basic ^quotas.
                       SCHEDULE   I.INSURES TO BE TAKEN BY COUNTRIES NOT EXPORTING- TO THE FREE MARKET,17HSTHER IMPORTERS  SELF-SUFFICIENT OR EXPORTERS ONLY TO PREFERENTIAL                             &apos; /MARKETS.          Assurances to be given on  the following lines:-          The United States:  to allot to foreign countries a quantity atleast equal to the proportion imported from foreign countries atpresent plus a pro rata share of any increase in consumption thattakes place in the United States.          Commonwealth of the Philippine Islands:   It is assumed thatduring the life of the proposed International Sugar Agreement, theUnited States will continue  the present free duty quota of theCommonwealth of the Philippines; but if by subsequent agreement.between the United States and the Philippines there should be a diminution of the quota during the next five years, there shall &quot;bea corresponding allocation to foreign countries other than the philippines.          The Commonwealth of the Philippines foregoes its claim for an export quota to the present free market on condition that itshall have a share of four per cent, in such increase as may occur in the free market requirements.          The United Kingdom: to maintain in operation its presentlegislation controlling sugar production, which in effect fixes amaximum of 560,000 long tons of white sugar (618,000 metric tons rawvalue), subject to the proviso set out below.          The British Colonies:  to  limit total exports to a basicfigure of 950,000 long tons    965,254 metric tons), subject to the proviso set out below.          Australia:  to limit exports to a basic figure of 400,000long tons (s 406,423 metric  tons), subject to the proviso &quot;set out below.
          union of South Africa:    to limit exports to a basic figure  of230,000 short tons (- 209,000 metric tons), subject to the proviso setout &quot;below.          India:    to prohibit exports except overland and to Burma, i.e.to territories to which she is already accustomed to export.          Canada:  to give aii assurance that the Dominion Government hasno intention of stimulating . the production of sugar by way of subsidyby special remission &quot;of -taxesj by increased protection, or otherwise.          China:   No diminution in the import requirements of this market is expected &quot;by&apos;the Chinese Government during the term of an  &apos;Agreement.EROvTSO REGARDING THE UNITED-. KINGDOM, THE BRITISH COLONIES AND THEDOMINIONS OF AUSTRALIA AND.THE UNION OF SOUTH.AFRICA.  s          The quotas of production for the United Kingdom and of exports for the Dominions and Colonies, would be subject to Increase bya share of the increased consumption of Empire importing countriesexactly proportionate to their present share of supplies to thosecountries.   The consumption requirements  in 1936/37  of the parts ofthe British Empire which import sugar  (i.e. excluding the Dominions ofAustralia and the Union, of South.Africa, India and the sugar exportingColonies) on the basis  of the Conference estimate  of  free.marketrequirements for that year, are about  5,330,000 metric tons.   The  totalquotas proposed by the  Dominions and Colonies would amount  toT,580,000 metric tons (s 1,555,000  long tons).   Their joint  share&apos; ofany future increase  in  consumption  in  the Empire countries  referred to would therefore be 47.4, the distribution  of this  share between  theColonies and the two Dominions being a matter for  settlement betweenthem.x Modified in the light of  the statement  made&apos; on&apos;behalf  of the United   Kingdom Delegation at the meeting of&apos; Heads of Delegations  on the   26th of April.
           As to the United Kingdom, its maximum production is 618,000metric tons and its proportionate share of increase in future consumption in Empire Countries is therefore 18.6$.          If advantage is not taken of this right to increase UnitedKingdom&apos;s production in any year, His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom reserve the right to add the share of increasedconsump-tion in the Empire attributable to the United Kingdom (18.6$) to theexport quota for the British Colonies. .  The net effect of theseconditions is that there will remain available for suppliers to the freemarket 54$ of any increase of consumption in British Empire Countries,representing the proportion of British Empire supplies ordinarily takezifrom the free market.                            -
                        SOHEDUL E   II.       SCHEME  OF  QUOTAS  FOR.  EXPORTS  TO  THE  FREE  MARKET.a)  The quotas set out in column 1 of the table attached should  be    adopted as basic quotas subject to&quot;the adjustments for 1937/38    indicated in columns 2 &amp; 3;b)  A Sugar Council to be set up by the Agreement, should be empowered    to require in the --ears 1937/38 and/or 1938/9 a reduction of quotas by    a unifrom percentage not exceeding 5 per cent in either year, if,    after a full survey of the market position made shortly before the    commencement of each of those years, it considers such reduction    necessary.  The percentage reduction should be calculated on the    effective quota for each year after allowing for any parts of quotas    which may be definitely released, i.e. for 1937/38 it should be    calculated on the figures in column 3;c)  The Council should not have  power to require any reductions of basic    quotas in subsequent years but should be charged with the duty of    watching the market position and should make to the Governments .    concerned any recommendation it may think necessary regarding the    reduction of quotas,d)  The Council should have power, at any time, if it considers that    market requirements render desirable an increase of supplies in    excess of the effective quotas in force for the time being, to    allot additional quotas to whatever extent it considers necessary.    Such additional quotas should be allotted pro rata to the basic    quotas;e)  Any country which does not expect to use its full quota in any year should    notify the Council by some fixed date, of the estimated amount which    it does not expect to use and the amounts, thus notified, shall be    available for redistribution, if the Council shall so desire, among the    other exporters*
          It is suggested that any amounts so available for redistribution-bution should in principle be redistributed among the other exporting countries pro rata but that the Council should have discretion to varythis principle to meet proved cases of special hardship subject to suchlimitations and upon such conditions as may be determined.A reserve quota has been, provided to meet the requirements of..countrieswhich have not been regular exporters to the free market-in recentyears but may need an opportunity of exporting in order, for instance,to dispose of a surplus due to unusually large crops.    If not calledupon this reserve would be avBJJ^ble-- or-jai&amp;teibution as in e) above.

The Committee has in mind the same definition of exportable sugar as was given in paragraph 7 of  Article III      of the Chadbourne Agreement i.e.  that in the case of Cuba, Java and other cane sugar countries it should be      sugar of the nature and types heretofore exported by each of such countries respectively and in the  case of      the European Beet sugar countries it should mean raw sugar tel quel, European white sugars to be  converted -      to a raw basis at the rate of nine parts white to ten parts raw.(b) During each year of the Agreement,  Jugoslavia to have a claim on this to the extent of 10,000 tons.(c) As shown  in col.  (2) Czechoslovakia will be allowed an extra allotment of 90,000 metric  tons in the year      beginning 1st September 1937; Czechoslovakia will also be allowed extra allotments of 60,000 metric  tons and      25,000 metric tons in the years beginning 1st September 1938 and 1939 respectively; it  being understood  that      Czechoslovakia would take steps to reduce its acreage to correspond to those figures.(d) Excluding exports  to Mongolia, Tanatuva and Sin-Kiang.
