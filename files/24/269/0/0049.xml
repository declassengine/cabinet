G.    Colonial Office, Downing Street,.                                   V            May 27, 1937.                               Government House, Jerusalem, May. 20,1937:    AS one measure to restore order and diminish crime we interned some 200Arabs known to be bad characters by the Police by order of the District Com-missioner of the Northern District or Assistant District Commissioners.    When  I was in Galilee  I agreed  that in  view of the reduction in crimeduring the  past two months, a number should be released.  Before this was done,about 180 went on hunger strike for three days, but the strike ended when Keith-Roach  carried out his intention of releasing about another 70 in addition tothe 25 he had already rightly released.    A sympathetic strike of one day was organised both in Acre and  Haifa;little harm in  itself, but it shows  in the  present state of tension how easily astrike or disorder can be started.    I gave an  interview to Haj Amin (the Mufti) and the Secretary of the ArabHigher Committee,  who urged the release of all internees, remonstrated againstthe issuing of the schedule and any further immigration of Jews; and, in  quite a friendly way, discussed the action of Government in compelling  a large numberof very poor Arab workers to move from their present completely  insanitaryquarter of  tin  shacks in the middle of Haifa town.  Haj  Amin again to mysurprise promised co-operation with Government, and suggested he might be ableto find some Wakf land suitable for our  transfer scheme!  This might  form a useful adjunct.    The Jewish Press, of  course,  say  that Government  released  the interneesowing to the pressure of Haj Amin, and that we reduced  the schedule also owingto fear  of  that gentleman.  Tweedy, the  Press  Officer, has explained that thequestion of release  of  the  better class  of the internees had been decided  days before any  strike took place;  but plain  facts are not always acceptable to either the Jewish  or Arab Press.    The Amir Abdullah is also overflowing with  a sense  of his own  comingimportance; you  will  soon  receive a  despatch conveying the  extraordinarydemands put forward  by the Transjordan Government for alterations  in thetreaty. &amp;c.    Kirkbride* tells me the Executive and some  members of  the  LegislativeCouncil were ordered by the Amir to put forward these demands.   Of course, no           * Assistant British Resident in Transjordan, now acting as Resident.      [15267]
one thinks they could be granted, but if the Amir does mention them in LondonI hope he will get a definite rebuff, otherwise he is quite capable on his return of getting a party together to start agitation.  His present Chief Minister has donevery well; but the Amir wants a more pliable Minister  and only with  some difficulty have Cox* and I restrained him from sacking the present Chief Minister.Cox knows of no  suitable man to succeed the present Chief Minister.     As you know I have always foreseen that when the citrus prices  fall below.a certain level, the least remunerative groves will fail.  Travelling the last two days through Sharon and the Tulkarm district, I  saw several groves not beingirrigated this  year,  and heard of: many others  which  will  be  insufficientlycultivated.  Apart from economic results, this  means the employment  of lesslabour the next six months.     Crime has been  reduced, but the basis of continued reduction is not secure.National feeling and inter-racial feeling grow ever stronger; and sporadic murdersare only one sign.     Trespassing is always common, but in place of legal action rifle shots are nowoften the reply.     The Jews&apos; determination to live apart from Arabs is shown not only by the enthusiasm  for Tel Aviv Port, but also in the rapid decrease of employing  Arablabour or buying Arab-grown products.     I am far from blaming the  Jews for this : but it strengthens my belief thatin some; drastic change lies our only hope of  restoring good order and  lastingconfidence and security.     The reaction  to the Schedule is a true index of the situation in Palestine.The Arabs  not loudly but  deeply resent it on  principle in that they will resistin any way  open to them any further immigration of Jews and sale of lands.     The Jews loudly and deeply resent any Government action that checks the rapid rise of their numbers in Palestine or the acquisition of land.   ,.&apos; Difficult as a clear-cut division may prove in practice, racial feelings are now so high that to continue to carry out our present policy will soon prove impossibleexcept by suppression of the Arabs and the maintenance of a large and permanentgarrison.* British Resident in Transjordan.
