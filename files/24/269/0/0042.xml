Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1937.-SECRET.                                                        Copy No.CP. 137 (37).CABINET.CLOSER  ASSOCIATION  BETWEEN  SOUTHERN  RHODESIA,        NORTHERN  RHODESIA AND  NYASALAND.  Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the                     Secretary of State for the Colonies.    THE Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, Mr. Huggins, and two elected members of the Northern Rhodesia Legislative  Council, Sir Leopold Moore and colonel Gore-Browne, are coming to this country for the  Coronation, and theyhave been informed that, if they so desire, they will be given an opportunity of discussing the question of the amalgamation of Northern and Southern Rhodesia.In view of this we have  thought it desirable to set out the recent history of thisquestion and to analyse the issues involved.                   I. Historical Summary 1931 to 1937.    2.  The question of the future of Southern and Northern Rhodesia receivedvery full  consideration  from Government  in  1931.   In April of that year aJoint Memorandum No. CP.  84 (31)  was circulated  to  the  Cabinet by  the secretaries of State for Dominion Affairs and the Colonies.  They recommendedthat a declaration of policy should be made, after consultations with the political parties then in opposition.   The  Cabinet approved their recommendations, anda further  Joint Memorandum No. CP. 162 (31)  gives the policy recommendedafter  consultation with Mr. Amery and Lord Winterton for the Unionists, andSir R. Hamilton and Mr.  Pybus for  the  Liberals.   The policy is  set out  inAppendix I.    3.  The policy was announced on the 2nd July, 1931, in the House of Lordsby Lord Passfield  and in the House of Commons by Mr. J. H. Thomas.  Incommunicating  it to the Northern and Southern Rhodesian  Governments, HisMajesty&apos;s  Government in the United Kingdom stated that they fully appreciated the advantages of  the  closest co-operation  between Southern and northern rhodesia on matters of policy, which are of common  interest to both  territories,and were at all times ready to facilitate consultation between the two governments with a view to such co-operation.    4.  The decision of His Majesty&apos;s  Government in the United Kingdom met with general acceptance in  this country, and  was at least acquiesced in by the rhodesias. When Sir Ronald Storrs arrived in Northern Rhodesia as Governorat the end of 1932, he found the issue more or less dormant.   So far as SouthernRhodesia  was  concerned, he  was given to understand  that  the  financial andeconomic difficulties Northern Rhodesia was then experiencing  rendered fusionconsiderably less attractive  than heretofore.    5.  Various factors, including the decision to  change  the  capital  fromLivingstone to  Lusaka,  led to  a revival  of  the amalgamation  movement inNorthern  Rhodesia in the  early part of 1933.   An  amalgamation motion was      [15183]                                         &apos;             B
moved in the Legislative Council in June 1933; three unofficials voted for it, twoabstained and one voted with the Government against it.  Shortly afterwards theGovernor  received a copy of a resolution (see Appendix II) passed by the NdolaNative;-Welfare Association.  In  sending this resolution, the Governor  statedthat,  while it was  true that the  great  majority  of  the natives  of northern rhodesia  were not competent to weigh the advantages or disadvantages to them-selves of amalgamation, there was no doubt that this resolution expressed a pointof view that was generally held by the more intelligent natives and that it will develop as they do.    6.  Meanwhile  the  amalgamation movement  had been  gaining  force in southern  Rhodesia, where  it  was strongly  supported by  the  then  Premier,Mr. Moffat.  The movement, however, received a serious setback from the changeof Government in Southern Rhodesia which brought Mr. Huggins into power in1933.  It  was soon  clear that  Mr. Huggins&apos; new  Government did  not regardamalgamation as an early issue.    7.  A further motion in favour of amalgamation was moved in the northern rhodesia  Legislative Council in the autumn of 1933.   AH the unofficials voted in favour of it, but  the protagonists  realised that the movement had fallen far short of their hopes.   In addition to the native opposition the  Governor reportedthat as a  result of enquiries he was  satisfied that  the large capitalist  interests were pronouncedly opposed to amalgamation : the managers of the copper mineshad made  it clear to him that they hoped  for a continuance of Crown Colonygovernment for a long time to come.   The Missions were also strong opponentsas they were &apos;&apos; bitterly critical &apos;&apos;  of native  policies south of the  Zambesi.   TheGovernor  concluded  that he  saw no  reason to recommend that  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should consider any modification in the policy announced in Parlia-ment in July 1931.    8.  In January 1935 the Governors of Southern Rhodesia, Northern rhodesia and Nyasaland agreed that in pursuance of the approved policy of co-operation,periodical conferences should be held at Salisbury, which would be presided overby the Governor  of Southern Rhodesia and to  which the Prime Minister ofSouthern Rhodesia would be invited.  The Governors of Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland were warned in March 1935 by the Secretary of State for the colonies that the conferences should be informal and advisory, and that no commitmentsshould be  entered into,  especially  as  regards native affairs.    9..  After the first conference at Salisbury in April 1935, the  Governor ofNorthern  Rhodesia  was anxious to make  a  public announcement that the three territories  would be regarded as closely linked with  each other  and that theywould  be  termed  in  future British Central Africa, but the Secretary  of Statefor the Colonies replied as follows :--        &quot; If you were to make an announcement on the lines which you have    suggested, drawing  a  distinction between  East and Central Africa, the    question raised might become a major political issue, in which case the policy    of co-ordination would be hampered and the conferences would lose much of    their  value.  Such a result would be  particularly regrettable, as the merits    of personal co-operation have been demonstrated by the great success which    appears to have attended the Conference held  at Salisbury  in April.        &quot; To ascertain how far a Protectorate Government can co-operate with    the Government of  a  self-governing, Colony must of  necessity  be a slow    process,  and  it  would, I consider, be a mistake to take any  sudden  step    forward before the ground has been fully explored.&quot;            .  .    10-  Nevertheless the publicity which the holding of the  first conference atSalisbury  received had  the effect of  reviving the movement  for some  form of association between the Rhodesias.  On the 24th  January, 1936,  a meeting  washeld at the Victoria Falls Hotel between a number of members  from the SouthernRhodesia  Legislative Assembly and the unofficial members of the northern rhodesia  Legislative Council, which  pressed for complete amalgamation.   Theresolutions are given in Appendix III.    11.  The resolutions of the Victoria Falls conference were debated in theSouthern Rhodesia Legislative Assembly in April 1936 on a motion  &quot; that  this house is of the opinion that  the early amalgamation of Northern Rhodesia  and
Southern Rhodesia; under a constitution conferring the right of complete self-government, is in the best interests of all the inhabitants of both Colonies.&quot;  the mover  of the motion stated  that,  although they  were  asking  for completeself-government, that was put forward as a maximum and they might be preparedto accept something less.  His seconder, hoAvever, dissented and made it clearthat he  would  not  accept  amalgamation on  any  other  basis than completeself-government.   Other  speakers stated  that  their  reason for supportingamalgamation was to &quot; ensure the white colonisation of the united territories.&quot;    12.  The  Prime  Minister,  Mr. Huggins, for  the reasons  shown  in the summary of his speech see Appendix IV -supported the motion.  His main points  were that amalgamation would be a safeguard against Southern rhodesia and  Northern  Rhodesia  being  absorbed  piecemeal by the  Union, and  thatamalgamation was desirable for  economic reasons.  The amalgamation motionwas carried with four dissentients.    13.  The  resolutions  of  the  Victoria  Falls  Conference and the record ofthe debate  in  the  Southern  Rhodesia Legislative Assembly were sent home bythe Southern Rhodesia Government at the end of May.  The whole  question wascarefully considered in the Dominions and Colonial Offices and  replies were sent to the Southern and  Northern Rhodesia Governments explaining why HisMajesty&apos;s Government  in the United  Kingdom  were unable to  reconsider the1931 decision at that time.  An extract from the reply sent  to Southern Rhodesia.is annexed  as Appendix V.    14.  The  Governor of Southern Rhodesia telegraphed in reply that:  &quot; my ministers ask me  to inform you  that in their  opinion  situation has undergonechange in several important respects since 1931, and that my Prime Minister willbe glad to avail himself of opportunity which you have been so good as to offer himto discuss the whole matter further with you when he visits England next year.&quot;    15.  In October 1936 the Governor of Southern Rhodesia, prior  to coming on leave to this country, forwarded in a. semi-official letter to the Secretary of Statefor Dominion  Affairs a confidential memorandum in which he gave his personalreasons for desiring  early  amalgamation.   His reasons  were  summarised asfollows :   &quot; (1) That in view of the unmistakable trend  in  the Union of South Africa           towards an un-British, even if not  an anti-British, atmosphere and           outlook, it was important in Imperial  interests to secure  the preservation-           tion of a distinctively British element beyond  the Limpopo,  strong           enough to function as a counterpoise to nationalistic Afrikanerism           from outside if it remained outside the Union, or as an internal leaven           if it should eventually  enter the Union;    (2) that  the only hope of the achievement  of  sufficient strength  for this           purpose lay in  the obliteration of  dividing  boundaries and the           combination of resources and efforts in British Central Africa;    (3) that, unless such co-ordination were effected,  the inevitable tendency           would  be  for the several  Territories to drift  further  and further           apart,  and in  the weakness of their  individual isolation to  become           powerless to resist engulfment  by the Union, one by one, on terms           entirely within the Union &apos;s  own control  and under conditions likely           to  result  in  the  submergence  of   any  distinctively  British           Characteristics;          &apos;    (4) that  administrative and  political  association  with Northern Rhodesia           Nyasaland  under one Governor  exercising  influence   in  all  three           Territories might be expected  to divert the development of  native           policy in Southern Rhodesia from the  risk of approximation towards           the less liberal policy of the Union by securing the continuance of           correlation with the more liberal British  traditions and practice;    (5) that  departmental  co-ordination  would conduce  ultimately  to the           promotion of administrative efficiency and economy.&quot;    16.  On the 21st January, 1937, the question was discussed informally at ameeting at the Colonial Office at which the  Secretaries of State for DominionAffairs and the Colonies and the Governors of Southern and Northern Rhodesiawere present.    Sir Herbert Stanley, while pointing out that he was not in a       [15183]                                    ^                B 2
position to speak for Southern Khodesian Ministers and could only give his ownpersonal views, elaborated the arguments in his memorandum in favour of earlyamalgamation.  Sir Hubert Young shared Sir Herbert Stanley&apos;s views as to thedesirability of forming a British bloc in  Central Africa, but he considered  itshould take the form of a loose &apos;&apos; federation &apos;&apos; and he was opposed to amalgama-tion for the following three reasons :       (1) It was too early for him to  certify that  the interests of the Northern           Rhodesia natives would not be subordinated to those of the whites. He           held that the ideal was that the interests of neither whites nor natives           should be  subordinated to the other,  and that Northern Rhodesia           should remain separate until the natives have so progressed that their           subordination would be impossible.     (2) &quot;Owing to the new  copper mines Northern Rhodesia may turn out to be           a more important territory economically than Southern Rhodesia, and           it would not be prudent to hand over the reins of government to what           may  eventually be the  less  important country.   Under immediate           amalgamation  Northern  Rhodesia would have  a  small minority           representation in the  combined Legislature, and  its interests  would           suffer.     (3) Immediate amalgamation meant that the expenditure exceeding  400,000           incurred by  Government on the construction of the new capital at           Lusaka, plus large  sums spent there by  business enterprises, would be           wasted.     17.  Sir Hubert Young favoured  a scheme of closer association which would preserve to the United Kingdom Government control of native policy in northern rhodesia.  He suggested that the first stage might  be the setting up of a council which would be something more than the Governors&apos; Conference, and on which the unofficial element would be  represented, to advise on problems  affecting the three territories, without having executive or legislative authority.  Sir Herbert Stanley,however, thought that the Southern Rhodesia Government would be unlikely toaccept such a scheme, as the Council would be represented as an impairment of itsown authority.   He explained that there  was no such overwhelming desire in southern  Rhodesia for  amalgamation as would induce the Southern rhodesia government to accept a scheme wrapped up with formidable restrictions;  he alsofelt  that  the  objection  to  such a scheme was  that  it  would  involve extra expenditure, whereas amalgamation  might be expected to  result in economy.However,  he emphasized that he  could  not  guarantee what view the  PrimeMinister of  Southern Rhodesia, who alone could speak for the Southern rhodesia government in this matter, would take as to this.                      II.-A nalysis  of  Issues Involved.     18.  Very important  problems  of  Imperial  policy  are involved in  thisquestion.  They may be considered under the following heads :      (a) Aspirations of Southern Rhodesia and of  the white settlers  in Northern           Rhodesia.     (b) Native policy.     (c) Defence and Imperial control of  Northern  Rhodesian minerals.     (d) Position of Nyasaland.     (e) Position of Barotseland.     (/) Position of the Union of  South Africa.     (g) &quot;British Central  Africa.&quot;(a) Aspirations  of Southern  Rhodesia and of the  white settlers in Northern         Rhodesia.     19.   The  European population of Southern Rhodesia has risen from 49,900in 1931 to about 55,000.  It is mainly of United  Kingdom origin, very loyal  tothe British connection and averse from becoming a part of the Union, although there is a minority which  considers that that is its proper destiny.  The greatmajority are satisfied that they are able not only to manage their own affairs andthose of their  natives (about 1  million), but also to administer Northern Rhodesia,with its 1-1 million natives,  as well.
    20.  The main aim  in  Southern Rhodesia is to build up  a large whitepopulation settled on the land, and so long as Northern Rhodesia was a territorywith poor agricultural prospects,  with comparatively few white settlers  and anannual  deficit, there  was no pressure from  the  Southern Rhodesia settlers foramalgamation.  In fact, it may be held that they attained self-government earlier than would have been possible if they had been linked to the predominantly nativeterritory of Northern Rhodesia.                                              -    21.  There is little or no evidence that the white settlement policy could have much scope  in Northern Rhodesia.  The population of that territory  is 10,000Europeans and 1,500,000  natives.   The  number of Europeans actually engagedin agriculture is about 500.   The registered electors who vote for the  elected members of  the  Legislative Council number 3,400, of whom half are  on thecopper belt.   The agricultural prospects of the territory are poor, and it is largelythe market provided by the copper belt that enables the settlers to make a living.But although Northern Rhodesia  is an  unpromising area for white settlement,the importance of its mineral wealth  is now fully appreciated in SouthernRhodesia, where no doubt it is anticipated  that the copper belt  would  be to a united Rhodesia what the Rand has been to the Union, and that the native areas would be administered comparatively cheaply by officers recruited from the localEuropeans.    22.   These aspirations of the Southern  Rhodesia Europeans are  shared bythe white settlers  in Northern Rhodesia.  Although  they could hope for only afew representatives in the unified Government, nevertheless they would feel securethat the primary aim of the Government was to build up further white settlement.(b) Native Policy.    23.  The guiding principle of native policy in the African territories, forwhich His Majesty&apos;s Government in  the United  Kingdom  is responsible,  istrusteeship.  His Majesty&apos;s  Government regards itself as a trustee seeking  topromote the intellectual,  moral and  economic well-being of the Africans.   it recognises  that it has also a  duty to the world at large to see that  the material sources of these areas, both agricultural and mineral, are developed, but such development is not to be pushed to an extent which jeopardizes the well-being ofthe natives.  In the words of the  Hilton Young Commission, &quot; the advancement of native interests  is an  end in itself.&quot;   In  accordance with that policy, the natives are given every opportunity of developing their economic position, whether as  agriculturists,  skilled artisans,  traders,  clerks  or  teachers.  They  areencouraged to grow new and  improved varieties of crops, both for local consump-tion and for export; they  are  assisted by Government in the  grading and marketing  of their crops,  and  native co-operative  societies are  encouraged.Native institutions  are fostered under the system of indirect rule, and nativetaxation is fixed at  rates which are within the  reasonable capacity of the nativeagriculturists to pay.  Where the native works as a labourer, it is the Govern-ment&apos;s policy to see that the  methods  of  recruitment,  wages paid, housing conditions, &amp;c, should be  satisfactory, and that the requirements of wage labour are not such as to disorganize the traditional native communities.   In those partsof East and Central Africa where non-native communities have settled, the aim off the Government  is to ensure the maximum welfare and  co-operation of thedifferent communities.   That is the dual policy of the complementary and paralleldevelopment of native and non-native.    24.  While  the  record  of Southern Rhodesia  in  the  matter of  nativeadministration is not unsatisfactory  and  a  good deal has been done to  assistnative development, it is probably true to say that, as  is almost  inevitable in  a self-governing  Colony  with  a  mixed  population,  the  Southern  Rhodesianviewpoint  in regard  to native administration tends  more towards the  Unionattitude  than to  that of  His Majesty&apos;s  Government  in the United Kingdom,i.e., the general policy favoured is that of a segregation of the natives in theirown areas and the limitation of their opportunities to compete with Europeans.Outside the fairly considerable native reserves which have been set aside for theoccupation of natives under communal tenure,  the land available for settlement
has been divided into European and Native areas in which the acquisition of landis, confined to Europeans and Natives respectively.  The chief towns fall in theEuropean areas and the natives cannot carry on trade or obtain employment iiithese townships without obtaining special passes for the purpose.     25.  In Northern Rhodesia the settlers&apos; view is that white interests shouldbe recognised as predominant in the railway belt, the  townships and the coppermines.   Such a division  of the country implies  a great restriction on nativedevelopment, particularly in the case of the copper mines which are dependentwholly on native labour and are the biggest single factor affecting the lives of thenative communities of the territory.  The mines depend on European capital and enterprise  and employ-a few thousand white workers,  but they are no  moredependent  on  white agricultural settlement  than  the  mines  in  Ashanti and nigeria.     26.  Sir Herbert Stanley, in his memorandum referred  to in paragraph 15,has suggested that native interests could be adequately protected by maintainingin the Constitution of a United Rhodesia the  powers  reserved to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment under the present Constitution of Southern Rhodesia.   Under thatConstitution the main power of control of  the Secretary of State arises from theprovision in the Letters Patent, to the effect that  the Governor shall reserve forthe signification of His Majesty&apos;s pleasure any law (save in respect of the supplyof arms, ammunition or liquor to natives) whereby natives  may be subjected ormade liable to any conditions, disabilities, or restrictions to  which persons  ofEuropean descent are not also subjected or made liable.  The provision gives theSecretary of State formal power to delay the coming into operation of a measuredifferentiating against natives which seems to him questionable, pending  consul-tation with the Southern Rhodesian Government, but it would in practice be verydifficult for him to insist  against the strongly-expressed wishes of the southern rhodesian Government upon such a law remaining permanently suspended.  TheSecretary of  State&apos;s power is thus in foimr negative, and, although he can exerta certain influence informally,  he  is not  in a position officially to initiate  orprescribe any definite line of policy.   Moreover,  it may be anticipated that,  as time goes on, Southern Rhodesia will look for the removal of all restrictions  fromits  Constitution.   It must be recognised that, in the event of a  real clash  ofopinion between the  Secretary of State and the Southern Rhodesian Governmenton a question of major importance affecting natives, the position of the Secretaryof State might become very embarrassing, since, if  the Southern Rhodesian.Ministers chose to resign rather than accept the Secretary of State&apos;s view, it is unlikely that the Governor would be able to secure any alternative Ministry.    27.  The conclusion seems inevitable that it would be impossible to inaugurateamalgamation without resigning for practical purposes  the position of the UnitedKingdom Government as  trustee for native  welfare in Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland.  As it would be impracticable to reduce the powers now possessed bythe Southern Rhodesia Government, it is not  possible to contemplate that thepowers reserved to the United Kingdom  Government under amalgamation couldbe greater than those in the present Southern Rhodesia Constitution.   Hence inmatters affecting natives in what is now  Northern Rhodesia  and Nyasaland, theUnited Kingdom Government would lose the power to initiate or prescribe any definite line of policy.  In the alternative of a loose form of closer association,i.e., with an enlarged Governors&apos; Conference, the power of the United KingdomGovernment as regards native policy in Northern Rhodesia or Nyasaland need not formally be impaired, but it would clearly lead to difficulties and friction if theUnited Kingdom Government were to  press their  policy in  a given case in face of determined  opposition by the  Southern Rhodesian representatives and theNorthern Rhodesian European unofficial representatives.(c) Defence and United Kingdom Government Control of Northern Rhodesian         Minerals.    28.  In the Cabinet Paper CP. 84 (31), it was stated that &quot; as a matter  of empire policy, it appears desirable that the mining  area  (area  No. 3)  should remain under the control of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom J
ti 3 5These mines may before long be the governing factor in the copper markets of theworld, and their output will become essential to national defence in the event ofwar and of primary importance to the Empire&apos;s trade and manufacture in peacetime-&quot;  The prediction that the&apos;Northern  Rhodesia copper mines might before long be the governing factor in the copper  markets of the world is in process ofbeing fulfilled.   In 1931 -the export of copper from Northern Rhodesia was 30,927tons valued at  505.204.  In 1936 the copper produced was 142,332 tons valued at  5,669,142.    29.  If the control of these mines, passed under a local Settlers&apos;  Government,United Kingdom interests might be adversely affected  in many ways.  It  is not suggested that a Settlers&apos; Government would put difficulties in the way of mineralexports to the United Kingdom, but instead of  being in a position to control the mine  output  directly,  the United Kingdom Government would  have no morecontrol than it does over gold from the Rand.  The possibility of serious conflictsbetween  a Settlers&apos;  Government and  the copper  industry  cannot, moreover,  be excluded. The latter would be providing a very large proportion of Governmentrevenue, but it would have no  effective representation in the Government.   It isunderstood that the big  copper interests prefer the continuance  of  the present.system of Crown Colony Government, as  they feel that they are  safeguardedagainst exploitation by local interests.    30:  Apart from the Imperial importance of control over Northern Rhodesiaminerals, there are other aspects of  defence policy which would be affected  byamalgamation.  Under the present system it has not been difficult to provide forco-ordination of defence measures between the two Rhodesias and Nyasaland.Defence  plans of mutual assistance have  been worked out and embodied in local defence schemes.  Under amalgamation the prejudice which Southern Rhodesiashares with  the  Union against employment of  African troops may be expectedto prevail. Even under a loose form of association that prejudice may create difficulties. Of the eight native battalions which  form the garrison of East and central Africa,  two are  recruited in Nyasaland and one in Northern Rhodesia.The defence resources of East  and Central Africa would be materially weakenedif recruitment could no  longer be carried out  in these two territories.(d) Position of Nyasaland.    31.  Nyasaland is even more a native territory than Northern Rhodesia.  ItsAfrican population is 1,600,000, its European population 1,800.  The Nyasalandnatives are intelligent and well educated, and in view of the few opportunities of economic development  at  home  they  emigrate in large  numbers to all the neighbouring territories.  The number of Europeans in Nyasaland has diminished,but the few European settlers in  the country hold similar views to those in the rhodesias, and press for  the amalgamation of Nyasaland  with Northern and southern Rhodesia in order that it may be administered by a Settlers&apos; Government.On the other hand, educated natives in Nyasaland hold meetings and protestwhenever  the settlers  advocate union with the  Rhodesias.    32.  Nyasaland is a small area  for a separate Government, and the questionof merging it in Northern Rhodesia was recently carefully considered.  The twochief  difficulties were the  Congo  Basin Treaties and Nyasaland &apos;s Public  Debt.The whole of Nyasaland is in the conventional basin of the Congo; that makesimpossible a Customs union  with Northern Rhodesia under a  uniform tariff.Nyasaland&apos;s Public Debt and its liabilities under the Zambesi Bridge and alliedrailway schemes make it necessary for the United Kingdom Exchequer to affordit: assistance each year at the rate of about  200,000.  Consequently, Nyasalandis under Treasury control, and under any amalgamation with Northern Rhodesiait.would be necessary either to maintain a separate budget for Nyasaland and solose many of the advantages of amalgamation, or to place  the  finances of  the unified administration under Treasury control, a course which would be strongly opposed by all sections in Northern  Rhodesia.    33.  It may be added that the view which is held by  the local  Europeans in nyasaland and the Rhodesias is  that,  to facilitate the formation of  a British
Central Africa State comprising the two Rhodesias and Nyasaland, the UnitedKingdom Government should be prepared-     (1) To write off the large sums (over  1,000,000) it has advanced to Nyasaland           in the past, and     (2) To  take over for the  future the liabilities  arising  from the Zambesi;           Bridge  and allied railway schemes  (at present about  200,000  per           annum).It seems clear that Nyasaland would not be welcomed into a United Rhodesiaexcept on some such terms.(e)  Position of Barotseland.     34.  Barotseland is a native  State, in  treaty relations with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  in the United Kingdom. &quot; Under  the present  Northern Rhodesiaconstitution,  the Legislative  Council is empowered to legislate for  it, and that:is not open to serious objection so long as there is an official majority in  theCouncil.   Under amalgamation it is probable that Barotseland would  have tobe constituted a separate area under a High Commissioner  responsible to HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.  Under a loose form of association the  special  position  of Barotseland  would also need separate  consideration.There are disadvantages as well as  advantages in its separation from the restof Northern Rhodesia.(f)  Position of the  Union of South A friea.     35.  The South Africa Act of 1909  contains a provision that  &quot; the King,with the advice of the Privy  Council, may on  addresses from the Houses  ofParliament of the Union admit into the  Union  the territories administered  bythe British South Africa Company on such terms and conditions as to representa-tion and otherwise  in each case as are expressed in the addresses and approvedby the King.&quot;  Prior to the termination of the  administration of Southern andNorthern Rhodesia by the British South Africa Company, a referendum had beenheld  in Southern  Rhodesia  in 1922 on the question whether the electoratefavoured responsible  government or  entry into  the Union on terms which hadbeen proposed by the  Union Government.   The result of the referendum was infavour of the grant of responsible government which  was accordingly institutedin September 1923,  and in the  following year His Majesty&apos;s Government in  theUnited Kingdom took over from the Company  the administration of northern rhodesia^1)     36.  It is,  of  course, possible that the Southern Rhodesia Government,  ifthey feel that there  is no prospect of amalgamation with Northern Rhodesia, may decide at some future date to enter into negotiations with the Union Governmentfor the admission of Southern Rhodesia into the Union.  It has also been suggestedby some of the Elected Members of the Legislative Council in Northern Rhodesiathat the question of the entry of that Territory into the Union should be taken up with the Union Government, though it is difficult to see how Northern Rhodesiacan  join  the Union  except  in conjunction with Southern  Rhodesia.   the amalgamation of the Rhodesias would lessen the prospect of any such movementin either Territory;  indeed, it  has been thought in the past that on this groundthe Union Government might regard the  amalgamation of  the Territories withsome disfavour.  Sir  Herbert Stanley states, however, that  he has recently beeninformed both by General Smuts and by Mr. Pirow that they thought the close reunion of Southern and Northern Rhodesia very desirable and that the considera-tion of their  eventual adhesion to the Union was a matter for the not very nearfuture.  These opinions cannot, of course,  be regarded as necessarily representingthe considered views of the Union Government.   At the present time the UnionGovernment are particularly interested  in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasalandas they are anxious to conclude an agreement by which they will be enabled  to recruit large numbers of natives from these  Territories for  the Rand mines.  On    (J) These constitutional changes must be regarded as having altered the position for practical purposes, but the statement in CP. 84 (31)&apos;that  &quot;The Union have, of course, no claim to  anypart of Northern Rhodesia &apos;&apos; seems to have  gone too far.
the other hand the Southern Rhodesia Government wish to have the first callon the surplus native labour of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and fear thatthe competition  of the Rand Mines will raise native wages.  It seems  likely,therefore, that the Union Government  would regard any proposal for the close reunion of the two Rhodesias and Nyasaland as a matter affecting their interestsand would  ask for assurances as regards the recruitment of Northern rhodesia and Nyasaland labourers for the  Rand.  No doubt,  provided they were givensuch  assurances, the Union Government would not  raise  objections  to the amalgamation of the Territories and they might  to some extent welcome such acourse in the hope that it would facilitate the ultimate enlargement of the union to include both the Rhodesias.    37.  Another aspect  of the matter which must be noted is that,  as waspointed out in  the  Cabinet Memorandum CP. 84  (31),  the prospect  of an amalgamation of the Rhodesias might lead to a renewed request from the UnionGovernment for  the transfer to  the Union of the High Commission Territories(Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate and  Swaziland).  The ultimateincorporation of these Territories in the Union is contemplated in the SouthAfrica Act, and the question of  their transfer has  been raised by the  UnionGovernment on  several occasions.  His Majesty&apos;s Government  in  the  UnitedKingdom have felt, however, that any definite demand for transfer would be very embarrassing in view of the strong opposition of the native inhabitants  of the territories to being placed under the administration  of the Union  Government.It may be mentioned in this connection that the Southern Rhodesia Governmenthave themselves  expressed a desire to take over at any rate the northern  part ofthe Bechuanaland Protectorate.(g)  &quot; British Central Africa.&quot;    38.  In the quotation from  Sir  Herbert Stanley&apos;s  memorandum in para-graph 15 were given the main reasons why he desires the formation of a BritishCentral African bloc. The arguments advanced by the advocates of this idea areas follows : The Union of South Africa will  become more un-British in outlook,and the British territories to the North, i.e., Tanganyika, Uganda and Kenya,are predominantly  African.   Between these two  groups  should be created a central African bloc in which British ideas  and British civilisation would pre-dominate.  The three territories of the British Central  African group share acommon outlet  at  Beira,  and their amalgamation or  closer association  would remove the risk of differing policies being pursued; it might be expected to fostera broader-minded and more progressive outlook in internal development and uponthe native question; it  would  pool educational experience and  resources,  andlighten  the pressure of administrative overhead  charges by distributing theirincidence  over  a wider  field; and it  would  counteract any tendency  to  prefersectional to common  interests in dealing with problems of Customs Tariffs, com-munications,  and defence.  The Southern Rhodesia settlers would feel that theUnited Kingdom Government had appreciated their efforts to maintain Britishideals and had recognised that they could be trusted to handle the native question in a satisfactory manner.  The settlers in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland would  not be  driven, by  their  inferiority  in numbers,  to develop  an anti-Whitehall complex and to look to Pretoria rather than to London as a safeguard against &quot;Africanization.&quot;    39.  Some  of these arguments undoubtedly carry weight, particularly on theeconomic side.  Politically also the conception of a united British  Central Africamight be useful, and it may well be that the  absorption of the combined area bythe Union would be more difficult than the absorption of,  say, Southern Rhodesiaalone.  It is also desirable to counterbalance, if possible, the un-British tendenciesin the Union.   On  the other hand, it is for consideration whether the amalgama-tion or close association of the three northern  territories would for many years tocome produce a territory which could  in any sense be  regarded as a &quot; counter-balance &quot;  to  the Union.   It  must be  remembered  that Southern Rhodesia is acompact Territory  with valuable mineral and agricultural resources.  It is these advantages that have enabled it to make considerable progress economically sincethe grant of  self-government.  Its white population is, however, still  relatively       [15183]                                                       c
small and it seems very doubtful whether it is adequately equipped to take overthe administration of Northern &quot;Rhodesia and Nyasaland.  The result of such a union of the Territories, involving as it necessarily would in the case of northern rhodesia and Nyasaland the withdrawal of the present control  and assistanceof the United Kingdom Government, might merely be to produce a Central state which  was weaker  than the present separate administrations, financially  and otherwise.                      III. Possible Lines of Approach.    40.  We have first to hear what the Southern and Northern Rhodesian repre-sentatives have to say.   Subject to that, it appears to us that the possible courses open to the United Kingdom Government are     (1) to adhere to the 1931 decision, or    (2) to institute an enquiry as to whether some form of union or closer asso-          ciation is or is not desirable in the near future.As regards adhering to the 1931 decision, it must not be forgotten that the UnitedKingdom  Government announced  last year that they  did not feel that a sufficient time had elapsed to justify its reconsideration.   In the few years that have elapsed since 1931 the lines of development in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland have not taken definite shape.  In both, for example, the future of white settlement is stillundecided.  A Commission consisting of Sir Alan Pirn  and Mr. Milligan is about to be sent to Northern Rhodesia to enquire into the finances,  administration andpossibilities  of development, and  a similar  enquiry is about to be undertaken in nyasaland.   The reports of these Commissions  should be of  value in considering what is the best line of development for these territories.   During the next fewyears it is anticipated that Northern Rhodesia will for the first time have a reallyadequate revenue, owing to the prosperity of its copper mines.  Moreover, someyears  of prosperity should  enable the Northern Rhodesia  Government to set itsnative administration on a sound footing and to make a real advance in nativewelfare.   These are reasons for a reaffirmation of the 1931 policy, a reaffirmationwhich might be made more palatable if it were accompanied by an indication thatthe  United  Kingdom  Government would be  prepared  to  examine the wholequestion afresh in a definite number of years.    41.  A further reason for maintaining the policy  of 1931 is that it may bethought inopportune that the question of union between Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland and the self-governing Colony of Southern Rhodesia should be raised at a time when the future of the ex-German Colonies is being pressed by Germanyand publicly canvassed.   Under the present system of Crown Colony governmentthe  United Kingdom Government is the trustee for  the three&apos; million natives inNorthern  Rhodesia and Nyasaland.  It may  be  thought undesirable that theUnited Kingdom Government  should at the present  time take any        whichmight  be  represented as implying that they are considering the possibility ofrelinquishing that trusteeship.    42.  On  the. other hand, there are factors which  favour a decision to investi-gate some form of union or closer  association.   It would probably be welcomed bya considerable part of the people of Southern Rhodesia, who, as has been pointedout above, are very loyal to the British connection, and would also help to avoid thefurther development among  the  settlers  of  Northern Rhodesia of an  &quot; anti-Whitehall complex.&quot;  A full  investigation should at any rate provide material for  further consideration, and the advocates of union  would  feel that they hadbeen fully heard.    43.  If it is decided to investigate some form  of union or closer association,there  would seem to be certain advantages  in the investigation being made by aCommission which would include representatives of the  chief parties in the Houseof Commons, since the matter is an important one affecting the authority ofParliament, and one on which, if the 1931  precedent is followed, the opposition parties should take their share of responsibility. We think that the  commission should have the widest terms of reference, and should include in its scope the twoRhodesias and Nyasaland.
APPENDIX  I.                         Extract from CP. 162 (31).    HIS Majesty&apos;s  Government in the United Kingdom have  given  carefulconsideration to the request received from the Government of Southern rhodesia and from the elected members of the Legislative Council in Northern Rhodesia,that a  conference  should be held in  order  to  consider  the  possibility  ofamalgamating Northern Rhodesia with Southern Rhodesia under  a constitutionsimilar to the present constitution of Southern Rhodesia.    His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are not prepared to agreeto the amalgamation of Northern and Southern Rhodesia at the present time.They  consider  that  a substantially greater  advance should  be  made in  thedevelopment of Northern Rhodesia  before any final opinion can be formed as toits future.   It  must be remembered that it is less  than  eight  years since HisMajesty&apos;s  Government assumed direct responsibility for  the administration ofNorthern Rhodesia.   Very considerable progress has been  made  during these years, but  even greater  changes, affecting  the whole balance of  the  various interests in the country, are almost certain to result from the development of themining industry.   At present the European population is  small  and scattered over a wide extent of territory, while the problems of native development are in a stage which makes it inevitable that His Majesty&apos;s  Government should hesitate to let them pass even  partially out of their responsibility.    On  the other hand,  His Majesty&apos;s  Government, while  considering  thatamalgamation is not  practicable now or in the near future, do not  wish to reject the idea of amalgamation in principle should  circumstances  in  their opinionjustify it at a later date, and fully realise the prejudicial effect upon progress in both countries,  if such a  rejection  were regarded as a permanent bar to their future evolution.   Their  view is that for some time to come Northern Rhodesiashould continue to work out its destiny as a  separate entity,  observing the- closest possible co-ordination with its neighbours, and especially with Southern Rhodesia.    His Majesty&apos;s Government feel that, in order to prevent misconception, theyshould state at  the outset  that the conditions of  any scheme of amalgamation, if and when  it arises for actual  discussion, must make a definite provision for the welfare and development of the native population.  Barotseland would necessarilyrequire separate treatment, and arrangements may possibly have  to be made inregard to other parts of Northern Rhodesia.   Without going into details of thesecontingencies, it is sufficient that it should be indicated that the territory to be amalgamated with Southern  Rhodesia would not necessarily have  boundariescoterminous with the present  boundaries of Northern Rhodesia.    It will be remembered that, in order to secure as great a measure of continuity of policy for the future as may be possible, the Secretary of State for the colonies and I arranged some  few weeks ago to confer with members of the two opposition parties on this matter.  The conclusions which I have announced are, of course,those of His Majesty ^Government, but I am happy to think, as the result of the conversations referred to,  that they  are likely to  commend themselves to members on the other side of the House.[15183]D    44.  Accordingly,  in  our discussions  with Mr.  Huggins  and  the  elected members of Northern Rhodesia, we should propose first to ask them to  explainhow, in their view, conditions have altered since 1931.   If, as  the result of  thediscussions,  we  should feel  satisfied  that the balance  of  advantage  lies  ininvestigating some form of union or closer association, we should report again toour colleagues and make further proposals.                                                (Initialled)      M. M.                                                                W. O. G.    Downing Street, May  8, 1937.
       Resolution passed by Ndola Native Welfare Association (1933).Amalgamation of Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia.    The Chairman moved the following resolution :-         &quot; That  while  this  Association  would  welcome  amalgamation with    Nyasaland where laws and conditions are similar to those of this country,    it humbly asks that the Government will not agree to the amalgamation of    Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia; such a step would, in the opinion    of this Association, be greatly to the detriment of the interests and legitimate    aspirations of the native population of this country who number 1,000,000    to 10,000 Europeans.        &apos;&apos; Mr. Mumbwa seconded.        &quot;The following points were  raised in discussion:         &quot; That  the  natives of  Northern  Rhodesia  feel convinced that  the    introduction  of Southern Rhodesia  legislation into Northern  Rhodesia in    native opinion would be a hardship.   That  the  present  Government in    Northern Rhodesia is more suitable for Africans and better than its replace-    ment  by a form of self-government which in this Association^  opinion does    not provide genuine representations and does away with the declared policy    of the Government  of protection  and trusteeship of natives.        &quot; That  native conditions  in  Southern  Rhodesia are harder  than these    of Northern Rhodesia.  That  the position of natives in Southern Rhodesia    is inferior to ours and there are many restrictions in force there from which    we  are free.        &apos;&apos; That  the native community should be allowed to  express  its wishes    in the matter through the mouths of the Chiefs before anything  is decided.        &apos;&apos; That the amalgamation of the countries can be of benefit to  Europeans    only and not to natives.        &quot; The motion was put to  the vote and carried  unanimously.&quot;APPENDIX  III.  Resolutions passed by Victoria Falls Conference on January 23 and 24, 1936.    1.  THIS  Convention is of  the opinion that  the early Amalgamation ofNorthern and Southern Rhodesia under a Constitution conferring  the right of complete self-government is in the interests  of  all  the  inhabitants of  bothColonies.    2.  This Convention considers the following to be suitable  terms on whichAmalgamation could take place :     (a) The  Establishment  of  One  Government  embracing  Northern   and           Southern Rhodesia and consisting of:                1. A Governor.               2. A Legislative Assembly.               3. A Legislative Council.               4. A Public Service.               5. A High Court.    (&amp;) The Headquarters of the Government of Rhodesia to be at Salisbury.    (c) The  existing Electoral Acts of the  two Colonies  to apply respectively           until  changed  by  legislative  enactment  by  the   Government of           Rhodesia, provided  that the number of Members in the Legislative           Assembly to be not less than seven for Northern Rhodesia and not less           than thirty for Southern Rhodesia.
    (d) The respective public debts of both Colonies to be a debt charge on the           Colony of Rhodesia.    (e) The Legislative Council to be partly nominated and partly elected, save           that the only nominated Members shall be not more than three persons           nominated thereto in the  interests of the Native inhabitants.    (/) The Law  to be  administered  in Northern Rhodesia and  in Southern           Rhodesia to be the same as  is now respectively administered  until           changed by legislative enactment by the Government of Rhodesia.    3.  The Government of Southern Rhodesia be requested to settle the detailsconsequent on  the foregoing Resolutions.    4.  The Government of Southern Rhodesia ask the Imperial Government toreceive a deputation from the Government of Southern Rhodesia and the elected members of Northern  Rhodesia to discuss the principle of Amalgamation andthe draft of a  Constitution for the proposed Colony of Rhodesia.    5.  The draft Constitution be submitted to the electorates of Northern and southern Rhodesia respectively by means of a Referendum.    6.  This and the foregoing Resolutions be forwarded to the Governments ofNorthern and  Southern Rhodesia respectively for transmission to the secretaries of State concerned.APPENDIX  IV.    Speech of Mr. Huggins in Southern Rhodesia Legislative Assembly on                               May 7, 1936.    MR. HUGGINS realised that the factor which must weigh with the ImperialGovernment was the large number of natives in Northern Rhodesia, and main-tained &apos;&apos; there is no question that we in Southern and Northern Rhodesia have thenecessary good intentions with regard to natives, and I believe we can accept this very difficult task.&quot;  He criticised the generally accepted view of trusteeship fornative peoples, and  maintained that &quot; we have a  system here which  containswithin it the germs of destruction of the trustee, and in all our  actions here for developing the Colony as a whole,  especially when  it comes to developing thenative people,  we must remember that we must do nothing which will&apos;destroy the ruling race, because if you do that you destroy the trustee.&quot;  He suggested that&quot; it must be better for Northern and Southern Rhodesia to unite, for the subjectpeople alone, because if you take the other way of looking at it, and supposingthere is some  early union with the  Union of South  Africa by  force of circum-stances, of course Northern Rhodesia would then be squeezed in  more or less as avassal state like Basutoland and Swaziland.  It would mean, ultimately, that northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia would be part  of the Union of SouthAfrica.&quot;  He added, &quot; Now I regard the present native policy in the  Union asdistinctly ungenerous.  I agree with Mr. Hofmeyr, and I do think on this groundalone that the Imperial Government should favour the principle of Northern and southern Rhodesia taking over this considerable duty,  rather  than that theyshould try by any pressure to induce us to go south.&quot;  In his opinion, &quot; the reasonsfor joining with Northern Rhodesia from our point of view would be largelyeconomic reasons on account of the great increase in these days of barriers andtariffs and so forth, the advantage of having a  common Customs Union must beobvious.  There are people who scoff at there being any market in the north. Themarket in the north is a very valuable one, which will be developed very largely inthe future and will be  of  great  assistance to us as well as to the  farmers inNorthern Rhodesia and others in absorbing the  products which  we produce, andit will reduce the quantity we have to export and so generally improve theeconomic conditions of the landed people in both territories.&quot; .  . . .&apos; &quot; There is another reason for speed as I see it, and that is the crystallisation of a form ofgovernment in Northern Rhodesia  which  is different to ours,  just as  ours is
somewhat different from that of the Union; and I see a danger if that is allowedto go on for a long time,  that it may be impossible to rectify the differences and bring the two countries  together.&quot; ....   &quot; There is another thing which is happening in Northern Rhodesia which is foreign to our policy and foreign to thepolicy of the Union, and that is the training  of native troops.  I think that is another thing why it would be good to have an early union so that that could be stopped.  It is contrary to the policy of the white people in this territory, and Ithink it is a pity that it occurs in any of the British territories.&quot;APPENDIX V.  Extract from Despatch to Southern Rhodesia, No. 336 of October 12, 1936.    THE suggestion has also been made that His Majesty&apos;s Government  in theUnited Kingdom should convene a Conference to  discuss the whole question of amalgamation.  I have  considered this  suggestion, but, after consultation withthe Secretary of State for the  Colonies, I do not feel that any useful purpose would be served by such a Conference at the present time.  The  decision withregard to amalgamation which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdomannounced  in 1931 was only  taken after the most thorough examination  of thewhole problem and also after consultation with Members of the ParliamentaryParties then in opposition.  Although it was made clear in that announcement that His  Majesty&apos;s Government did not wish to reject the idea of amalgamationin principle, should circumstances justify  it at a later date, the announcement was definitely intended  as settling the question for some time to come, and HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the  United Kingdom do not feel that during the  periodof five years which has elapsed there has been such a material change in conditionsas would justify reconsideration of the decision reached after  so much thoughtin 1931.    There  is the additional point that, although there may be a body of opinion among the European Agricultural settlers in  Northern  Rhodesia  in favour of amalgamation, the unanimity which was reached at the Victoria Falls conference was obtained only on the basis of a Constitution conferring the right of &apos;&apos; completeself-government,&quot; and I gather that there are some members of the SouthernRhodesia Legislature who would definitely reject the idea  of amalgamation onany basis short of this.  I think, however, that your Prime Minister will haverealised from his discussions with my predecessor in London in 1934 and 1935that His Majesty&apos;s  Government in  the United  Kingdom  could not  regard itas practical politics  to  discuss  such  a  suggestion at present even in relation to southern Rhodesia, and, since the resolution in the Southern Rhodesia Legislaturewas passed, the position in this respect will have been made clear in SouthernRhodesia by the  recent publication  of  your despatch relating to  the proposed amendments of the Southern  Rhodesia Constitution.    In the circumstances  I  fear that,  apart  from the  more general objectionwhich  I have  mentioned, any  expression of  willingness on the  part  of HisMajesty&apos;s  Government  in the  United Kingdom to  entertain the  idea of aConference could only give rise to a misleading impression.  But I am looking forward  to seeing your Prime Minister personally next year on the occasion ofthe Coronation, and if he should desire it, I shall be glad to take the opportunityto discuss  this  matter with him.
