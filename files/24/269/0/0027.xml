Printed for the Cabinet:&apos; April 1937.SECRET.                                                         CopywNo.CP. 122 (37).CABINET.SITUATION ON THE  NORTH COAST  OF SPAIN.               NOTE BY THE FIRST LORD OF THE  ADMIRALTY.    THE following minute sent to me by the Chief of the Naval Staff should be of value to  my colleagues in considering the difficulties that are inherent in.theSpanish situation.  They will note that neither he nor I have suggested any changeof policy in present conditions.   It must, however, be realised that the situationplaces a very heavy responsibility upon the men on the spot, and that try as bestthey may to avoid it,  a dangerous incident may take place at any moment.                                                   (Initialled)       S. H.    Admiralty, S.W. 1, April 26, 1937.SITUATION ON THE NORTH COAST OF SPAIN.                         ADMIRALTY APPRECIATION.    THE recent developments in connection with the situation which has arisenoff the north coast of Spain have modified the problems facing the Admiralty and make it desirable to prepare a fresh appreciation.    When the intention of the Spanish Insurgents not to permit food ships toenter Bilbao first became evident, His Majesty&apos;s Government  decided     (i) To discourage British ships very strongly from proceeding to Bilbao.    (ii) To  withdraw protection from ships which preceded in spite  of  the          Governmenfs wishes.   (iii) To propose  an arrangement with the  Spanish Insurgents under which          British ships bound for Bilbao should be diverted to Santander.    2.   Since then the following developments have taken place :      (a)  There has  been  a progressive watering down of  the &apos;&apos; warning &apos;&apos;  or          &quot; advice &quot; to British shipping. From  a direct intimation that it is          the desire of His  Majesty&apos;s  Government that they should not enter          Bilbao, they are now being  informed  that  the  Government  cannot          advise them to enter the port.    (6)  There has also been a progressive strengthening in the degree of support          given to British  shipping.   Originally protection, was  withdrawn          altogether from  ships  which proceeded to  Bilbao (although this          decision was never made public).  During the  debate last Tuesday the          position taken up  was,  in brief, that protection would be  afforded on          the high seas if one of His Majesty&apos;s Ships was within call, but that          ships would not be convoyed.  Now His Majesty&apos;s  Ships have virtually          taken steps to force six British merchant ships through as far as the          limit of  territorial waters.       [15088]
    3:  An analysis of the recent reports which have been received of the entry of British merchant  ships into  Bilbao  and Santander under  naval protectionshows that there are two changes in the basic assumptions which have been madein the Admiralty.    A.   In spite of the fact that  it has been stated publicly on more than one           occasion that British ships would not be protected  inside the 3-mile           limit, neither at Bilbao or Santander have the Insurgents made  any           attempt to interfere  with the British  ships once they had entered           Spanish territorial waters.    B.   The Spanish  Insurgent warships have now  asserted a  claim to a 6-mile           limit.   This claim corresponds with the old historic Spanish claim to           territorial waters-6 miles in breadth, but has never before been asserted         .  by the Spanish Insurgents during the  present war.  Hitherto,  they           have on several occasions indicated that they were prepared to accept           our own limit of 3 miles.    4.  The reluctance of Spanish Insurgent warships to interfere with british merchant ships inside Spanish territorial  waters may be  due to one of threereasons :     (i)  Fear of the coast defence batteries of the Government forces on shore.    (ii)  Fear of mines.   (iii) Fear of the action which might be taken by the British warships in theOf these three reasons the third seems the more likely, since they displayed thesame reluctance at Santander (where there are probably no batteries) as at Bilbao,where there are certainly coast defence guns of sorts.  Furthermore, the majorityof the mines, certainly  off Bilbao, were laid  by the Spanish  Insurgent forces.Their positions would therefore be known to  their warships.     5.  As regards the claim to a 6-mile limit  of territorial waters, this is a verynatural development  having regard to  the attitude taken up  by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.  What  we have in fact  stated from the  Spanish Insurgent stand-point is that we will  not interfere  with a blockade  of  Bilbao or Santanderprovided it is exercised within territorial waters.   Whereas a blockade restricted to 3 miles of the coast is shown now to  be an impossible proposition under present-day  circumstances, the  difficulties to the Insurgents attending one restricted to6-miles from the coast would clearly not be so great.     In this connexion it is necessary to make clear that the time available for anInsurgent  warship to stop a  determined  blockade runner after  she has passed the 3-mile limit is very short.   Probably the only certain way to stop her at that stage might be to fire  into her, and it is considered that this action might be taken.with perhaps serious  loss of life.  The onus would then be on the  British men-of-war to decide whether to  retaliate by firing into the  Insurgent warship.  (see in this connexion attached intercept.)Effectiveness of Blockade.    .6.  Up to the 23rd April,  the movements of merchant ships into and outof Bilbao since the 5th April, 1937, have been as follows : vicinity.Entered.Departed.British Cargo....Ballast1 (food)14 (iron ore)1Spanish-;  Cargo....&apos; Ballast2 (ironwork)9 (iron ore, coal or sand)68Danish Cargo....Ballast0101 (iron ore)Panamanian Cargo01 (iron ingots)2117
    Since the 23rd April (i.e., after the warning to British ships was made lessstrong), eight British ships have entered Bilbao and. Santander  (Hamsterley,Macgregor, Stanbrook, Stesso, f hurst on,  Jenny, Oakgrove and Sheaf garth).  Ofthese ships, five have been definitely intercepted by insurgent warships, but gotin under the awe of the guns of the British Fleet; we also know that the Spanishbattleship Espana was very close to intercepting the Sheaf garth.    The upshot of the foregoing  is that  the only food ships which have enteredBilbao since  the 5th April have been British ships.  So  far  as  we know,  theSpanish Insurgents  are  not attempting  to stop any other cargoes or ships  in ballast.  It is clear, therefore,  that, apart from the action  taken by the british navy,  the blockading measures  taken by  the Spanish  Insurgents have beeneffective.Mining.    7.   The  Admiralty  view is  that it must be accepted as likely  that  theSpanish Insurgents  will  resort to new  mining in the vicinity of Bilbao, andprobably also Santander, now that they realise that the British Government areno longer  holding  ships back at St. Jean de Luz, and that the British Fleet isprepared to give effective protection.  The Admiralty have reliable information to the  effect that a  Spanish Insurgent minelayer is being  held in readiness atPasajes.    The fact noted above, that the Spanish Insurgent warships are  now claimingterritorial waters 6  miles in width, means that they may regard  themselves asfree to lay mines up to that distance from the coast.  Such a minefield would be adequately covered by the warnings which the Spanish Insurgents have alreadyissued.Naval Protection.    8.   The  Admiralty  have hitherto considered that  a system  of  convoyingBritish ships would  not necessarily be the most suitable arrangement under the peculiar  conditions  existing at  Bilbao  and  Santander,  since, if the  SpanishInsurgents were prepared to take action inside territorial waters,  a convoy (the movements of which could not be  disguised) would merely enable them to capture the ships all together instead of singly.    The evidence  of the recent incidents shows, however, that they hesitate totake action within territorial waters, and if this is so convoy is the most effectivemethod of giving protection, since it combines complete safety from interferencewith a minimum demand upon the Naval forces.    An alternative arrangement might be for ships to call at some port, such asLa Rochelle,  in order to concert  with the Naval Authorities and  arrange their time of arrival in the danger area, so that His Majesty&apos;s Ships could be presentin the  vicinity; but,  clearly, a proper convoy system provides not merely greatersecurity, but a greater economy in the use of Naval forces.    In considering the possibility of instituting convoys, the danger from miningmust not,  however, be overlooked.  It would not be a satisfactory arrangement ifthe merchant  ships  were convoyed straight  into  a minefield laid  off Bilbao orSantander by the Insurgent Naval Authorities.    9.   In conclusion the Admiralty  desire to draw attention  to  the  following considerations :     A.  The telegrams received show  the state of electrical tension which is apt to develop in connection with the attempts of the Spanish Insurgent warships to stop the entry of the British ships.  For example, H.M.S. Shropshire reports thatyesterday &quot; the  Espana  trained  a turret  on the British ship  Oakgrove  and h.M.S. Shropshire already at  action  stations got ready  for anything.&quot;&apos;  after this incident  the Espana turned away  and  signalled : &quot;If you  do not avoidentrance  I  finish  you for  this  time.&quot;   There is no  doubt that  the SpanishInsurgents attach  great importance to the prevention of the entry of food shipsinto Bilbao.    So long as the present circumstances hold there is serious risk of an incidentinvolving an actual fight between British and Spanish warships.  The Admiraltyview is that  the S.N.O. should, in the circumstances under which  he is ordered to act, be given  a new and definite  authorisation in  advance to employ force if
necessary, and assured that whatever action he considers necessary to take willhave the support of  the  Government even if taken under  the  circumstancesenvisaged in paragraph 5.    &quot;B.   The policy  of His Majesty&apos;s Government on this question of the entry of  food  ships to Basque ports has throughout been  based  on the principle ofnon-intervention and it was this principle that was  the main justification for not affording protection to British ships within the 3-mile limit.     In. view of the  experience now  available, it  appears that the policy being followed, i.e., to protect on the high seas right up to the 3-mile limit, is in practicehaving  the  same effect, so far as non-intervention is concerned,  as  would  havehad a decision to escort our ships right into Bilbao.     C.   It  is also desirable to draw  attention to the clash which arises betweenthe  duties for the protection of British shipping and those imposed  on HisMajesty&apos;s Ships off the North Coast of Spain by the Non-intervention ObservationScheme.   Under the latter His Majesty&apos;s Ships are  assisting  in  preventingdischarge of arms and volunteers  to Spanish  territory;  under the former theyare engaged in  forcing food through in spite  of the purported blockade by theSpanish Insurgents.     Moreover, already  there has been difficulty in carrying  out the ObservationScheme in those parts of the Coast of Spain which are under the authority of theSpanish  Insurgents  and which fall within the British  zones  since the SpanishAuthorities have now  refused to  permit  British warships  even to signal to merchant ships within  Spanish territorial waters.  Having  regard to the actionwhich has been taken by the Navy against the Spanish Insurgents this retaliationis, perhaps, to be expected.                                                    (Initialled)      E.  C.     Admiralty,  S.W. 1, April 26, 1937.                          Message (see paragraph 5).                   From :  Intercept.   Date :  April 26, 1937.     FOLLOWING message was broadcast from Ferrol  to all ships at 1313/26on  150 Kc. :-         &quot; All ships, whatever their nationality, navigating in Spanish territorial     waters of Northern Spain between the meridians of Cape Video and Cape     Machichaco less than 3 miles off the  coast, which do not stop at the request     of the ships of the National Fleet will be bombarded (or fired at) by those     ships or by aircraft.
