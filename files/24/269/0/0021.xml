[pHTfl DOCUMENT  IS  THE PROPERTY  OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.REGRET.n.P.116 (37).COPY NO.4 5                        -  O A B I N E T.      ACCESS OF BRITISH SHIPS TO NORTHERN SPANISH PORTS.      Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.   1. With reference to the conclusions reached by theCommittee on the Protection of British Shipping last Friday,16th April, as to the access of British ships intoSantander, Gijon and other Northern Spanish ports other thanBilbao, I desire to call the immediate attention of mycolleagues to certain considerations which have emerged asthe result of further discussion of the subject.    A copyof the draft conclusions is given in Appendix 1 forconvenient reference.   2. The matter is urgent as a Question asking forinformation as to the &quot;instructions&quot; given to British ships in this respect is on the Order Paper for answer tomorrow(Tuesday).   It does not seem possible to refuse information and the Opposition will no doubt make a critical examinationof the reply.   It may of course be that the matter will beraised this (Monday) afternoon,   3. The Board of Trade notified the Committee&apos;s conclusionby telephone on Saturday to the Secretary of the ShipownersParliamentary Committee, but the information has not yet*been passed on to shipowners except the owners of four shipsheld up at St. Jean de Luz (who have throughout been kept informed of the Governments views) and one shipowner whotelephoned from Newcastle on Saturday for advice.* i.e.  11 a.m.  to-day (Monday, 19th April).
            Friday evening to Sir H.  Ghilton,  who replied yesterday            (Sunday)  that he had explained the position verbally to            General Franco&apos;s representative (the Military Governor of            I run) , adding &quot;&quot;but as he is not accustomed to diplomacy,            I can only hope he will convey it accurately to            General Franco&quot;.               5. In pursuance of the Committee&apos;s conclusion,  the            Admiralty, after discussion with the Foreign Office and            Board of Trade,  instructed the Vice-Admiral commanding the            Battle-Cruiser Squadron on Saturday that &quot;the advice to be            given to British ships proposing to enter Basque ports            (including Santander and Gijon) should &quot;be                 (a)  As regards Bilbao, they should be warned on                   behalf of H.M.  Government not to go into that area                   at present.                 (b)  As regards other Basque ports, they should be                   info.rmed that present information shows that these                   ports are. not free from risk and that H.M.  Government                   cannot therefore advise proceeding.                 (c)  They should also be informed of the extent of                   protection which can be given as described in                   paragraph 1 above&quot;.*               6. This advice must be regarded as a warning intended  by            the Government to dissuade shipowners from sending their            ships to Santander or Gijon.   If it is not a warning I            desire authority to make this clear to the  Shipowners            Parliamentary Committee,  so that shipowners may know that            they are free to decide for themselves (as they have to do            in respect of other Spanish ports apart from Bilbao) whether            to send in their ships or not.  This wi 11 also no doubt            have to be made clear in Parliament.a^a graph 1 states that naval vessels are to protect merchant vessels0n the high seas but are not expected to engage Spanish warships in greater force than would be expected of them in war.                                   -2-
   7.  If the Government intend this advice to dissuadeshipowners from trading with Santander or Gijoa, it seems likely, in view of last Wednesday&apos;s debate, that the Governmentwill be called on by the Opposition parties in Parliament tojustify their action.   8.  Before proceeding further I should explain that therules of the Mutual &quot;Clubs&quot; through which shipowners insuretheir vessels against war risks contain various provisions underwhich vessels proceeding contrary to warnings issued by theGovernment can be deprived of their cover against such risks.The issue of such a &quot;warning&quot; is therefore liable to make itimpossible for ships to proceed unless they can secure coveragainst war risks in some other way.  On the basis of the warning given last Monday (12th April) about Bilbao the Clubshave withdrawn war risk cover from vessels entering the &quot;area in the neighbourhood of Bilbao&quot;.   9.  Reverting to the question of justifying the recentconclusion as to Santander and Gijon, I desire to submit for theconsideration of my colleagues the following observations, whichhave emerged as the result of discussions since Friday.   10.  In the first place, it does not appear that general franco has made any threat as to the use of force against british vessels attempting to enter Santander or Gijon.  It istrue that his representative, the Military Governor of run,has asserted, in reply to an enquiry, that Santander and Gijon&quot;were in the same position as Bilbao&quot;.  The degree of importanceto be attached to this assertion may be judged by the considerations set out in Appendix 2 from which it will be seenthat the position of Santander and Gijon as regardsGeneral Franco1s threats is quite different from that of Bilbao,
   11.  In the second place,  I am aware  from the  telegram ofthe 16th April from H.M.S.&quot;Brazen&quot; (replying to an enquiry bythe Admiralty) to the effect  that the Spanish battle-ship&quot;Espana&quot; and a destroyer &quot;are able to intercept all shipsapproaching or leaving Santander and Bilbao&quot;, and that the&quot;Espana&quot; (then steering west) might be able to cover  Gijonalso.  I am not aware, however, that any attempt  has  in fact been made to interfere with British vessels going in  or out ofSantander and Gijon.  The Shipowners&apos; Parliamentary Committeeinformed the Board of Trade last Wednesday that seven vessels had been in and out of Santander since the previous Friday;and no suggestion has been made, so far as I know, that shipping trade is not proceeding with Gijon.   IS.  In the third place, I submit that even if it  were thecase that General Franco had threatened the use of force toprevent British vessels trading with Santander or Gijon, theGovernment would have to consider the matter again very carefully before taking any action on this account to dissuadeBritish vessels from going to those ports.   13.  In support of this view, I would point out that theposition at Bilbao is quite different from that at the otherports.  Bilbao is being besieged &quot;by land and its  .food supoliesfrom land sources are being cut off.  The entry of supplies by sea would thus materially affect the military situation.  It was for this reason that General  Franco was driven&quot;to warn theBritish Ambassador through the Military Governor of run, on the10th April that the entry of  the four British merchant shipsthen waiting at St. Jean de Luz would be &quot;resisted by insurgentwarships by all possible means even at the risk of serious incident&quot;.  This threat followed on the attempted interferenceby insurgent naval vessels, with the British S.S.&quot;Thorpehall&quot;when proceeding to Bilbao on  the &apos; 6th April.                           -4-
   14.  The Cabinet decided that, in the special circumstances,the use of British naval force to enable British merchantvessels to enter Bilbao would constitute intervention in thestruggle;  and this was the main ground on which their warning to shipping was defended in the debate last Wednesday by theHome Secretary and by the Foreign Secretary who made quite clear the Governmenfs view that &quot;to rescue, by supplies, a beleagueredcity ..... might be argued to be intervention&quot;.   15. , The special nature of the situation at Bilbao is illustrated by the fact while General Franco objects to ships carrying foodstuffs, the Military Governor at run indicated that it might be arranged to &quot;allow&quot; British ships to enter theport in ballast to bring away iron ore.   (See Appendix 2,second paragraph).   16.  So far as I am aware, Santander and Gijon are not beingbesieged and I do not know on what ground it could be argued that the entry of foodstuffs and other supplies by sea intothose towns (as distinct from any other Spanish sea-ports on one side or the other) would constitute intervention.   Tosuggest that either Santander or Gijon should be deprived of foodstuffs in case part of the supplies found their way toBilbao does not seem reasonable.   In this connection mycolleagues will bear in mind that Bilbao, Santander and Gijonare all in separate&apos; provinces.   Bilbao is of course in theBasque Provinces, the Government of which styles itself &quot;theAutonomous Government of the Basque country&quot;.   Santander andGijon are in Old Castile and Asturias respectively.   17.  I do not overlook the fact that, as pointed out by theHome Secretary in Parliament last Wednesday, the Governmentadvised British ships in August and September, 1936, not toproceed to Spanish ports which were known (by notification of
the Spanish Government) to be-watched more or less continuouslyby the Spanish naval vessels.    At that time however when theSpanish revolution was in its  early stagess  &quot;both the militarysituation and the respective political situations of the opposing parties were vastly different from what they are today0In present circumstances it seems to me essential that, weshould refuse to he influenced &quot;by any general threat, &quot;by either side in the Spanish struggle,  into dissuading British ships from entering Spanish ports, unless there is some specialsituation, such as that at Bilbao which would justify an exceptional attitude on our part.   To do so would he tantamount to recognising the right of &quot;blockade, one of the belligerentrights which HfM. Government have so recently announced thatthey would neither recognise nor concede.   As I have indicated,I do not know of any special situation at Santander and Gijonwhich would justify our adopting an exceptional attitude.   18.  So far as the insurgent naval vessels are concerned,therefore, the question arises&quot; whether there are sufficientgrounds to justify the Government in dissuading Britishshipowners from sending their  ships to Santander or Gijon orany other ports in Northern Spain apart from Bilbao.   19.  As regards the possibility of danger from mines, I would point out that ever since hostilities in Spain began the Board ofTrade have &quot;been passing on to  the shipping industry all the theinformation that came to their knowledge about mines and othersuch dangers affecting shipping in Spanish ports.   Among the ports covered by such notices  have &quot;been Santander and Gijon.It has always been understood  in the past, however, thatshipowners were free to use their own discretion as to whetherthey sent their ships to the ports mentioned in those notices.It seems clear therefore that  the risk of mines at Santander andGijon would not by itself justify the Government in dissuadingships from going there.
t14o   20.  I would ask ray colleagues to consider  -whether we  areto maintain the position with shipowners that we cannot  adviseproceeding to Santander and Gijon and other north Spanish  portj(excluding Bilbao).   The alternative is that we should  make  itclear to all concerned (including General Franco)  that we  arenot influencing shipowners against visiting those ports(excluding Bilbao) and that ships going to those ports will as already decided have protection on the high seas.   21.1 should add that I understand British iron and steelmanufacturers /in South Wales and elsewhere/are becomingseriousljr alarmed at the present curtailment of imports  of iron ore.    I need hardly remind my colleagues.es of the importance,  inthis respect, of Santander which I am advised ranks next afterBilbao in the volume of its iron ore exports.V. R.Board of Trade.    19th April, 1937.
                           APPENDIX 1.      Draft of - Conclusions reached on the 16th April., 1937.   1.  That a coMinunication in the following terms should hesent to the Ship Owners Parliamentary Committee by the Presidentof the Board of Trade.    &quot;Our present information goes to showthat other Basque ports as well as Bilbao are not free from risk.The degree of rislc may vary from day to day.   We cannot therefore advise proceedings  but in any case we shall if calledupon., give protection on the  high seas as already announced&quot;.   2.  That the First Lord of the Admiralty should arrange forthe British Naval Authorities in Spanish waters to be informed accordingly.
                     APPEKDIX 2.           Discussions with General Franco.  1. On 10th April the Military Governor of run on behalf ofGeneral Franco gave notice to the British Ambassador that the entry of four British vessels (then waiting at St. Jean de Luzwith cargoes of foodstuffs) to Bilbao would be resisted byInsurgent warships by all possible means, even at risk of serious incident.   The Ambassador got the impression thatsuch interference would certainly take place (inside Spanishterritorial waters) because the Insurgents&apos; determination to capture Bilbao at all costs made the prevention of the entry of foodstuffs a matter of paramount importance..  2. On the 11th April the Ambassador was instructed by telegram to write to General Franco in the following sense:-     &quot;H.M. Government cannot recognise or concede belligerent   rights and they cannot tolerate any interference with  &apos; British shipping at sea.   They are however advising their   shipping that in view of conditions at present prevailing in   the neighbourhood of Bilbao they should not go into that   area as long as these conditions continue&quot;.At the same time the Ambassador was told (l) to inform general franco&apos;s representative verbally that the Government assumed that if British ships go to Santander there would be no interference with them, in which case they proposed to arrangefor British ships to go to Santander instead of Bilbao as faras possible;  and (2) to ask what General Franco&apos;s attitude would be towards ships entering Bilbao in ballast and loadingore for export.   3. When these joints were put to the Military Governor ofIrun (General Franco&apos;s representative) be replied on.12th April(a) that the insurgent attitude towards diverting ships to
Santander is that &quot;both that port and Gijon are in exactly thesame position as Bilbao;(b) that he thought (2) could be arranged.   4. He added that he was telephoning the terms of the ambassador&apos;s letter to Salamanca.   He did not say whether hewas reporting points (l) and (2) likewise.   5. On 16th April (apparently after a reminder) general franco&apos;s representative called on the Ambassador and reportedthat General Franco &quot;was very satisfied with our attitude&quot;.As regards points (l) and (.2) the representative reiteratedhis previous statements but had not obtained General Franco&apos;authority for these.   6. It seems possible that the points have never been put to General Franco and that the &quot;threat&quot; to British shippingtrading with Santander and Gijon is merely that of theMilitary Governor of run.   7. In any case it is submitted.     (i) that General Franco&apos;s representative obviously couldnot acquiesce in any arrangement for diverting ships fromBilbao to other ports held by his enemies;  and    (ii) that if the point has ever been put to General Francothe latter may be expected (as the Ambassador has pointed out)to delay his answer as long as possible.   8. Further it will be observed that the statement entirely-lacked the specific character of the warning given byGeneral Franco about Bilbao.   9. The statement appears, therefore, neither definite norauthoritative enough to warrant His Majesty&apos;s Governmentbasing an important decision on it.   It may be added thatHis Majesty&apos;s Representative at Valencia reported on
15th April (following the debate in the House of Commons on14th April)  that the Governments  attitude regarding Bilbaohad aroused  great bitterness in the Valencia Cabinet and had caused an unfavourable impression and feeling of hostilityin Valencia.19th April,  1937.
