This Document  is the Property of His Britannic Majesty &apos;s Government. JOINT  MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN     AFFAIRS, THE  SECRETARY OF  STATE FOR INDIA AND THE                 PRESIDENT  OF THE BOARD OF TRADE.    The  Cabinet decided at their  meeting on  3rd February that if the Afghan Prime Minister asked for a credit for the export of British  goods, the Secretaiy of State for Foreign Affairs should  be authorised  to treat with him on the basis of  a credit for  100,000, to be provided by an entry in  the  Parliamentary Vote for Diplomatic and Consular Services.  At the Cabinet Meeting of 10th February this figure was increased to  150,000.    2.  The Afghan Prime Minister raised the question at his  first interview at the Foreign Office, and the resultant negotiations with His Royal Highness and Abdul Majid, the President of the Afghan  National Bank, indicated that they regarded  a credit of the size authorised as unacceptable, as they were anxious  to relate the credit to their requirements under  a five-years&apos; plan for industrial and economic development and wished to ensure the possibility of continuity of purchase.  In the course  of these  negotiations, however, Abdul  Majid  provided  a good  deal  of information  regarding the financial and economic position of Afghanistan.   The General Manager of the Export  Credits Guarantee Department,  who was assisting in the negotiations, was impressed by this information, by the good sense with which the Afghan Government have drawn up  their plans for the  development of their country, and by the success hitherto achieved.   This impression was confirmed by enquiries from quarters in the City  which have experience of Afghan trade, and the Advisory Committee of the Export Credits  Guarantee Department  consequently decided  that on  commercial grounds there was a case for the  extension of their machinery to cover a limited amount of exports to Afghanistan.   3. With  the  approval of our Departments,  negotiations  ensued  between  the General  Manager of the Export Credits Guarantee Department and Abdul Majid. These proved to be by no means  easy, but in a few days agreement in principle was successfully reached  and approved  by the Advisory Committee  and the Treasury, and  on 27th February an agreement was  signed with Abdul  Majid providing substantially as follows :        (a) Afghan organisations  will be free  to place orders for  United Kingdom     goods (not munitions of war) up to the total value of   500,000, at the rate of      100,000 a year in 1937 and the four succeeding years.   Unused  quotas  may     be carried forward, but not after the termination of the agreement.      (fe) These orders will be paid for by the issue of Sterling Bills by the Afghan     Treasury endorsed  by the Afghan National  Bank.  In respect of each  order     five  Bills of equal amount will be issued falling due over five years, beginning     two years after each order is placed.      (c) The Bills will bear interest at 5J per cent, per annum.      (d) In the event of war, catastrophe  or substantial deterioration of Afghan     conditions during the next five  years, we may withdraw from the agreement.   4. It is not proposed to give any  publicity to this agreement.   The Cabinet will, we think, agree that it is a most satisfactory one.   In consequence of it the  creditfrom the Vote for Diplomatic and Consular Services, approved by the Cabinet, willnot be required and has not been  included in the estimates for 1937-38.Printed for the Cabinet.
