DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT)J-Sil&apos;                 CABINET.           Copy No -  99(37)             AIR RAID PRECAUTIONS.                     Need for legislation.                Memorandum by the Home  Secretary.1.        The Comptroller and Auditor General in his Report tothe Public Accounts Committee on the Civil AppropriationAccounts for 1935-6 has drawn particular attention to the factthat &quot;the new and rapidly extending functions exercised by the&quot;Home Office in respect of air raid precautions have not yet&quot;been placed upon a specific statutory basis&quot;, and it seems certain that this question will be raised by members of theCommittee when the Home Office Account comes up for review next week.   The Committee have, in recent years, frequentlyemphasised the need for making specific legislative provisionfor Government expenditure, instead of relying merely on theauthority of the Appropriation Act;  and the Treasury for their part have in principle accepted the Committee&apos;s view &quot;that&quot;where it is desired that continuing functions should be&quot;exercised by a Government Department (particularly where such&quot;functions involve financial liabilities extending beyond a&quot;given year), it is proper that the powers and duties to be&quot;exercised should be defined by specific statute&quot; (treasury minute on the First and Second Reports of the&apos; Public accounts committee for 1932).2.        So far as the Public Accounts Committee is concerned,it will no doubt be possible, for the time being, to dispose ofany question that may be raised as to the need for legislation in regard to air raid services,  by saying that the matter isunder active consideration.   But apart altogether from therequirements of financial regularity,  it is quite clear that
legislation will &quot;be essential in the near future, not only inorder to place Government expenditure on air raid precautionson a proper footing, &quot;but also for the purpose of removingexisting doubts as to the power of local authorities to spendmoney on air raid services for which they have &quot;been asked bythe Government to make themselves responsible.   As things arenow, local authorities in many parts of the country are seriously concerned at the lack of specific authority for such expenditure, and now that the stage is being reached at whichheavy financial liabilities must be incurred in the executionof local schemes, misgivings as to the legal position arealready tending to impede progress and may at any time create an acutely dangerous situation.   It is essential that these doubts should be removed without delay and this object can onlybe achieved by a promise of legislation at the earliest possible opportunity.3.        I ask for Cabinet authority for legislation to beprepared.   In the meantime, an announcement in the House asto the intention to legislate may be necessary.   Theprovisions to be included in the Bill must be the subject offurther consideration in the light of the decisions which,I hope, will shortly be reached on certain concrete proposals on this matter, which are about to be submitted to the defence policy Requirements Committee.                            J .S .19th March,  1937.
