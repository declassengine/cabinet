COMMITTEE ON THE ORGANISATION OF THE  COM,  MINING-  INDUSTRY.                           FOURTH  REPORT.   1..      The composition of  the  Committee  was enlarged at  the   - Meeting of the Cabinet on  March 17th,  1937  (Cabinet  12  (37)   Conclusion 8), and is  now  as fellows:-           The President of the Board of Trade  (Chairman)           The Lord Chancellor           The Home Secretary           The Lord Privy  Seal           The Secretary of State  for Scotland           The Minister of Health           The Minister of Labour           The Attorney-General           The Lord Advocate           The Financial Secretary to the  Treasury           The Secretary for Mines   2.      Our First Report was submitted  on 26th July5  1935,    (CP.160 (35)), our Second Report on 26th May,  1936,    (CP. 143 (36)), and our Third  Report on  11th March,  1937,    (CP.  94 (37).).   3.      Our Thirst Report was under consideration by the  Cabinet   at  the Meeting referred to above.    Subject to the consideration   of  certain points,  the Report  was approved  in principle.    It   was agreed inter alia:-           &quot;(b) That the Bill  should be introduced at  the                  earliest opportunity, subject to approval                  of the final drafting of the  Clauses by                  the Cabinet  Committee on the  Organisation                  of the Coal  Mining Industry (instead of by                  the Committee of Home Affairs),1&apos;   4.      The special Arbitration Tribunal  appointed  to assess  the    global amount of the compensation to be  paid to the present    owners of coal has since issued its award.    The award  was-1-
announced by the Prime Minister in the following terms          &quot;The tribunal has given an award to the             effect that 15 is the appropriate number             of years&apos; purchase to be applied to the             agreed royalty income figure of  4,430,000..             The compensation payable under the terms             of the award will therefore he  66,450,000.             The Government have decided to accept the             award, and they intend to introduce the             necessary legislation as soon as possible.&quot;             (House of Commons Official Report, 26th April,             1937, coluimi 31) .5.    , We have examined with care the question of the early introduction of a Bill on the lines approved in principle bythe Cabinet, i.e., a combined measure dealing with the unification of royalties, compulsory amalgamations and the continuation with amendments of Part I, of the Coal Mines Act,1930..   By far the most desirable course, if it were possible,would be to pass the Bill into law before the Summer Recess.       It is now too late to circulate the Bill before the whitsun Recess and the most expeditious procedure, if it were decided to press on with legislation at once, would be tointroduce the Bill in dn my this week, and to circulate it during tie ITiitsun Recess, with a view to Second Reading beingtaken during the week beginning 30th Hay;6.     Unfortunately our enquiries show that progress at the rapid rate which would be necessary will be out of the question.The Chief Whip&apos;s opinion is that a minimum of nine days House ofCommons time will be required for a Bill of the importance and complexity of the present measure, i.e.:-                   Second Reading              2 days                   Committee                   5 days                   Report and Third Reading    2 days.This amount of Government time is not in fact available unless a change is made.in the provisional programme, it having beententatively arranged that the House shall rise for the Su-imerRecess on 30th July, and the greater part of the intervening-period of 45 working days being already assigned for essentialbusiness.,   Only 7-ijr days remain in which not only the Coal Billif it were proceeded with, but also the completion of the                          -2-
consideration of the Ministers of the Crown Bill and legislation on milk, wheat and several other subjects wouldhave to be included.   In the circumstances it seems out of thequestion to crowd a Coal Bill into these few days.7.     The Lord Privy Seal estimates that the consideration ofthe Goal Bill in the House of Lords will occupy some 4 or &apos;5weeks.    There is clearly no prospect of its reaching the Houseof Lords early enough to permit of consideration at this lengthbefore 30th July.8.     The conclusion appears to be that it is physicallyimpossible that a Coal Bill of the dimensions contemplated should become law before the Summer Recess.9.     We regard this as a very regrettable conclusion from several points of view.       (a)  The Government is pledged to early action, inparticular by the King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of the present session and by the prime Minister&apos;s statement quoted inparagraph 4 above to introduce Royalties legislation &quot;as soonas possible&quot;.s       (b)  Considerable uncertainty exists regarding the futureof interest rates, which makes it desirable that the Royaltiesloan should be raised with the minimum of delay.       (c)  Political objections can be foreseen if we do notforthwith implement the award which is generally held in thepress as having been unfavourable to the Royalty Owners.   TheGovernment will be charged as not being willing to wound their political friends.   Moreover the award of the arbitration tribunal will not escape criticism during the coming months.If legislation is deferred it must not bo taken for granted thatthe purchase price of  65,450,000 will continue to covvimandgeneral approval.55  In his statement of 9th March regarding the setting up of the arbitration Tribunal the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that ifthe Government did not, within six weeks after the decision ofthe Tribunal,  give notice to the Mineral Owners Joint Committeethat they were not prepared to accept the decision of the Tribunal.         &quot;the Committee will be entitled to assume that the          Tribunal&apos;s decision is acceptable to His Majesty&apos;s          Government and that they will introduce during the          present session of Parliament a Bill to acquire the          property on the basis of the Tribunal&apos;s decision&quot;.                           -3-
      (&amp;) The letter from the Treasury Solicitor to the mineral Owners&apos; Joint Committee about the  setting up of the arbitration Tribunal included the words from the Chancellor&apos;sstatement  of March 9th quoted in the footnote to paragraph  (a)above;  and we believe that the Tribunal was under theimpression that the Government intended to legislate forthwith,and that its proceedings were specially hastened.   In thesecircumstances it will be unfortunate if we.defer action forseveral months.      (e) Legislation covering at any rate  one part of thefield must be enacted before December 31st next, since Part I.of the Coal Mines Act, 1930, expires at that date.10,    We are informed by the Chief Whip that it is impracticable to adopt the compromise course of introducing the- Bill forthwith and making as much progress as possible with it before the holidays, and completing the remaining stages after the summer adjovirnraent on the grouncls that inthat case the House of Lords would require five or six weeksfor the further stages at a period of the year when the Houseof Commons would have no business to consider.11,    After careful consideration, our recomii:eiidation is thatthe Coal Bill should be deferred to the beginning of the1937-38 session.    It must,  in that case, be the first measure to be introduced after the King.&apos;s Speech, and it should, ifpossible, he pressed through all its stages before the Houserises for Christmas, 1937.       If it is necessary for the purposes of this programmethat the new session should begin considerably earlier than would otherwise be the case, we recommend that this shouldbe arranged.       If at the last moment some unexpected difficulty shouldoccur, making it impossible  to obtain the Rpyal Assent before christmas,  1937,  it will be  important that the  remaining stages
shall he  completed in January and February,  1958.    In this       event a short separate Dill will be required,  continuing       Part I of the 1930 Act for a few additional weeks,  which       we are assured is possible within, the rules of tine  House,       in spite of its obvious difficulties,,     -  12,     As regards the  terms of the actual Goal Bill to be       introduced, we recommend (subject to two or three drafting       points with which the  Cabinet need not be troubled) the       adoption of the draft  attached to the present  Report.       SUnraary^of Conclusipns. and Recpnmiendations,.       15.     Our conclusions and recommendations may be summarised       as follows            (i) It.is a physical impossibility, owing to the  very                .  limited, amount of parliamentary time available                  according to present plans, to pass into law                  before the  summer recess a combined Bill covering                  the three fields of coal policy which require                  legislation, via., unification of royalties,                  compulsory  amalgamations and the continuation                  with amendments of Part I. of the Coal Mines                  Act, 1930.           (ii) There are difficulties, from the Parliamentary                  point of view, in introducing a combined Bill,                  making as much progress with it as  is -possible                  before the  holidays, and completing the  remaining                  stages after a summer adjournment;   and  nothing-                  will be gained by introducing a Bill dealing with                  part of the field only.          (iii)  Our recommendation is that a combined Bill be                  carried through all its stages, as  the first                  legislative measure of the 1957-38  session;  the                  session should, be begun early enough to  allow of                  this Bill becoming law by Christmas next..            (iv)  Should the Bill, owing to some unforeseen contingency                  not have received the Royal Assent  by Christmas                  next,  it will be necessary to pass  a short  ad hoc                  measure continuing in force for a few additional                  weeks Part  I.  of the 1930 Act.            (v) Subject to a  few drafting points, with which  the                  Cabinet need not be troubled, we recommend  that                  the Bill to be introduced, at the beginning  of the                  1937-38 session should be in the form of the                  draft attached to the present Report.
