fS DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY  OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Iret.1. 139 (37)4 copy NO.CABINET.Committee on the Organisation of the Coal Mining Industry.                   Fifth Report.1.  At their meeting on May 5th, 1937, (Cabinet 20 (37),Conclusion 6) the Cabinet had under consideration our fouth report (CP.128 (37)), to which was appended a combined Bill,covering the three fields of coal policy which require legislation, viz., unification of royalties, compulsoryamalgamations and the continuation with amendments of Part Iof the Coal Mines Act, 1950.2.  During the discussion in Cabinet a new proposal was mentioned,viz., that, in view of the congested state of the parliamentary time-table, the introduction of the combined Bill should be deferred until the beginning of the 1937-38 Session.   In themeantime a shorter and less controversial Bill could be passed this Session which     (a) would cover the Government against one of the risks of          postponement, namely, a dragging out of the assessment          process and general delay until the award had lost its          relevance and would enable the distribution of the          money to be made earlier; and     (b) would pro tanto reduce the size and complexity of the          combined Bill by dealing in advance with a substantial          part of its machinery provisions.     The Cabinet postponed a decision on our Fourth Report, pendingexamination by us of the new suggestion.
3.  The new scheme which we submit to the Cabinet as the resultof our examination would involve a Bill not exceeding (withSchedules) 11 or 12 pages in length.   Broadly, it wouldprovide for the collection of information as to the units of separate ownership in which coal and rights associated withcoal are held, and of existing working leases of coal.     The definitions of the property and rights, and of the separate units of ownership, concerning which information isrequired would, mutatis mutandis, be the same as the definition in the combined Bill of the property and rights tobe vested in the Coal Commission,     Similarly, the procedure for the -submission andinvestigation of this information would 03 the same as isprescribed in the combined Bill for the making of claims for compensation^     Provision would be made, as under the combined Bill, for payment of the costs reasonably incurred in complying with theterms of the Bill.  The money would have to be found out of votes, but the combined Bill could provide for its recoveryfrom the Coal Commission.4.  We recommend this scheme to the Cabinet for the following reasons:-     (a) it has great and obvious advantages in the present          state of the Parliamentary time-table.   It postpones          until next Session the consideration of the lengthy          combined Bill and in particular of the very contentions-          tious compulsory amalgamations proposals, while it          enables progress to be made in the short time          available in the present Session in overcoming          opposition to the main principles of the Government&apos;s          proposals for the unification of royalties.                              -2-
     (b) the introduction of some coal royalties legislation          this Session is an accordance with the understanding          with the royalty owners, in virtue of which the          determination of the glohal purchase price was          referred to the Arbitration Tribunal.     (c) one of the principal objections of the royalty owners          to the combined Bill is the time which may elapse          between the appointed day and the actual payment of          compensation.   The new scheme, by providing in          advance machinery for registration of ownership etc.,          is designed to shorten this period by as much as six          months.5.  The most convenient Parliamentary course might be tointroduce the short Bill now contemplated in the House ofLords.   A good deal of the more technical discussions on theBill may be expected in any event to take place in that House.6.  If our recommendations are approved, an announcement ofthe Government&apos;s intentions&apos;will be necessary on the re-assemblyof Parliament after the wb.itsun recess.7.  It will be necessary for the present Committee to meet again, if our recommendations are approved, to consider theterms of a Bill to carry out the interim scheme.   We suggest,for the approval of the Cabinet, that a separate detailed examination of the draft Bill by the Home Affairs committee might be dispensed with.SUMMARY.8.  Our&apos; conclusions and recommendations may be summarised asfollows:-     (i) We recommend the introduction and passage into law          in the remaining part of the present Session of a          Bill to maice provision for the ascertainment and
       registration of particulars as  to  the  ownership  of       unworked coal and mines  of coal and of certain       associated property and  rights  in  land.    It  may he       convenient for the Bill  to he  introduced  in the       House of Lords. (ii) The main Bill dealing with the  rest of  the Govern-       ment&apos;s coal policy should he introduced as the       first legislative measure of the 1937-38  Session.(iii) A statement of policy will he necessary on the       resumption of Parliament after  the whtitsun recess.                  Signed on behalf of  the Committee.                           WALTER RUNGIMAN.                                 Chairman.2, 7/hitehall Gardens,             S.W.I.11th May, 1937.
