  (THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY  OFH IS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT).RET...154(37.).COPY  NO7CABINET.EXTENSION OF THE MILK ACTS,  1934 AND 1936.               Note by the Minister of Health.          While concurring in the suggestion that a Billextending the Milk Acts on the lines proposed should be introduced,I wish to draw attention to a matter of some importance.   Mycolleagues are aware that in the various debates in both Houses onNutrition and in answers to Questions, a number of assurances havebeen given that the Government have under consideration thedevelopment of schemes for providing cheap milk to mothers andinfants, and that the question is closely linked with the issues which were before the Milk Reorganisation Commission who reportedin November last.   As I understand the present proposals, theamount of money  ( 500,000) which it is intended to provide will dono more than suffice for the Milk in Schools Scheme and possibleextensions of that scheme on existing lines.   It will have^o^beadmitted, therefore, that the Bill does nothing towards securing acheap milk supply for other classes of consumers and the Bill will undoubtedly be criticised on this score.   The force of this criticism would be much reduced if in any announcement of longterm policy made before the Recess it is possible to hold out anexpectation that the reorganisation of the industry, which theannouncement will no doubt foreshadow, is likely to result in areduction of the price of liquid milk either generally or forspecial classes of consumers, including mothers and infants.   Inthe absence of some such announcement it will, I suggest,  bedifficult to reconcile the policy of the Government with the assurances to which I have referred.                                   K.  W.                              IOth June,  1937.
