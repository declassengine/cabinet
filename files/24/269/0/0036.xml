This Document  is the  Property  of His Britannic  majesty                         Government.SECRET.OP. 131(37)Copy Ho.^/- 3CABINET.Battersea Power Station.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Transport.    I.   I desire to bring to the notice of the Cabinet anapplication by the London Power Company for the consent of theElectricity Commissioners to the further extension of the BatterseaPower Station &quot;by the installation of an 100.,000 lew. turboalternator .set0    2o   This Power Station was authorised in 1927, and definiteobligations as to the avoidance of nuisance were imposed on theCompany,,    Questions were raised? however, as to the possible effect of the chimney emissions on public health and amenities;and in April, 1929, Lord Londonderry, the then First commissioner of Works, gave an undertaking that any proposals for the further extension of the Station would come within the purview of Parliament.It was arranged that this undertaking should he implemented hyconsultation &quot;between the Minister of Transport and the first commissioner of Yforks so that steps could he taken to draw theattention of Parliament to the matter.    3.   Following upon satisfactory reports from a technical committee presided over hy the Government Chemist, and with theconcurrence of the Cabinet on each occasion, the ElectricityCommissioners have given consents to the installation of furthergenerating plant and boilers in the first half of the Stationwhich has now been completed.   In each case the matter comes beforeParliament in accordance with the above-mentioned undertaking andthere was also prior consultation &quot;between the ElectricityCommissioners and the London County Council and other co-operatingLocal Authorities who did not raise objection to the extensions.On the last occasion, however, these Authorities asked that thePower Company should he made subject to the same detailed conditionsas to the avoidance of nuisance as were applied to the FulhamBorough Council when the extension of their power station was
- 2 - the last consent issued to the Power Company the Fulham conditions as to the avoidance of nuisance, ivhich are annexed.    4.   The present application of the Power Company made in October, 1936, is supported by the Central Electricity Board who have intimated that the growing demands upon the Grid system in the South East England Area render it necessary to extend the Battersea Power Station &quot;by the installation of an additional 100,000 kw0  generating set to be in operation by the Winter of 1939.    5.   The-&quot;building and civil engineering works necessary for this extension will constitute the commencement of the second half of the Power Station and will permit of the installation of boilers and further generating plant as and when authorised.    6.   While the present application seeks consent to the installation of new generating plant for use for the time being as a standby to the plant in the first half of the Power Station, ithas been recognised in dealing with the application that authority will be sought in due course for the installation of the complementary &quot;boiler plant to enable the fullest use to be made of the new generating plant.    The application has accordingly been considered on that basis.    7.   In submitting their present application the Company state that in the  design of the future gas washing plant the maximum advantage will &quot;be taken of all the accumulated experience gained in the past  three years which has resulted in the Company satisfying the authorities who make periodical independent tests at Battersea.    8.   The Electricity Commissioners have consulted the Government Chemist&apos;s Committee on the matter,  and the Committee has reported as follows:-   (i)  The  Committee is not aware of any recent developments on           the subject of the removal of sulphur gases from flue           gases at power stations of such a character as to           require modification of the process already adopted by           the Battersea Power Station.
- 3 -290    (ii)  The Committee-see no reason why  the installation of             further &quot;boilers and generating plant should not he             permitted so long as the Electricity Commissioners             are satisfied that any additional purifying plant             required hy  the extensions is installed or that  the             existing equipment is sufficient to treat the gases             arising from the extensions of plant.   (iii)  In coming to this conclusion, the Committee has assumed             that the same conditions of working in regard to the             treatment of flue gases will he applied to the new             section of the Battersea Station as already apply to             the first section.    9.   In accordance with assurances previously given the LondonCounty Council and other  associated Councils have been affordedan opportunity of making  representations and have informed theElectricity Commissioners that they offer no objection to theapplication of the London Power Company, Limited, in view of theintimation given to them  hy the Commissioners that the Pulhamconditions as to the avoidance of nuisance would he attached toany eonsent so far as appropriate.   10.   It was pointed out to the Councils that the presentapplication would he followed in due course by another applicationfrom the Power Company for authority to install the complementaryboiler plant and the Councils have considered the matter on that basis.   11.   The Electricity  Commissioners have informed me that inall the&apos; circumstances and having regard to the terms of the Reportof the Government Chemist&apos;s Committee, they are satisfied thatconsent to the further extension of the Battersea Station nowapplied, for can he given  subject to the attachment of the Pulhamconditions so far as appropriate and that authority for the installation of the complementary boiler plant can be granted indue course when a-oolied for.
   12.      In agreement  with  the Minister  of Health  and theFirst Commissioner of Works I therefore  seek the  concurrence ofthe Cabinet -   (a)  to a statement &quot;being made in Parliament  in view of  the       pledge given by the First Commissioner of  Works (Lord       Londonderry)  in April, 1929;   (b)  to the sanctioning by  the Electricity Commissioners of       the further extension  of the station as  proposed and of       the complementary boiler plant  when required;   (c)  to the Report of  the Government Chemist&apos;s  Committee being       laid before Parliament and  published as  a  Command paper,       as was done in the case of  previous Reports.   13.      I have read the Memorandum  by the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence on the question of air raidprecautionary measures^   14.      A Central Committee of  the  Electricity Commissionerson which the Home Office (Air Raid. Precautions  Department)and Central Electricity  Board are  represented is  investigating the precautions which can -be  taken at  electricity undertakingsincluding generating stations but  has  not  yet reported.   15.      Under the statutcrjr powers  available to them theElectricity Commissioners could not attach to their consentany conditions to which the Power  Company  objected without first holding a Public Inquiry;  and it  is doubtful whether thequestion of air raid precautionary measures is  one whichcould be made the subject of  such  an Inquiry.   16.      Moreover, unless  the Government is prepared to  meetthe cost, all expenditure on  air raid precautionary measuresat the Battersea Power Station must be defrayed by the LondonPower Company.   This will add to the  cost of  generatingelectricity for -the National  Grid System at this Station  andmust ultimately be paid for by the consumer.
17.There is every reason, however, to anticipate thatthe co-operation of the London Power Company will he forth-coming in respect of such  precautionary measures as can reasonably be taken.propose to attach to their consent a further condition that  the plans and drawings of the second half of the station shall besubmitted to them for their approval.   Such a condition was attached to the original consent authorising the establishmentof the first half of the station.   The Electricity Commissioneron receipt of the plans would consult the Home Office (Air Raidprecautions Department) and, before approving the plans, would ensure that they embodied all precautions which the power company could, in the opinion of the Commissioners, reasonably be asked to undertake.   19.     I ask that the concurrence of the Cabinet be givensubject to the condition that the Electricity Commissionersso proceed.18.In the circumstances the Electricity Commissioners21st May, 1937.
The Fulham Conditions as to Avoidance  of Nuisance.     The following conditions as to avoidance  of  nuisancewere attached by the Electricity Commissioners to their consent to the extension of the generating station of thePulham Borough Council.
