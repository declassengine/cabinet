CP. 129/37.              &apos; C A li I N E T.                   INDIA            Appreciation of the Political Situation  bythe Government of India, dated 30th April,1937.            Circulated for the information of the Cabinetby the Secretary of State for India.
9 R.u oConfidential  appreciation  of the Political  Situation  in India, dated  the  30th April,1937,  issued  on  the authority of the Secretary of State for  India.     The situation in v&apos;va.ziristan has deterioratedconsiderably since mention was made oi it in the appreciation forwarded last February.  On February 17th anattack was made by some Ghilzais from Afghanistan on theWana column which was carrying out a march near the Afghanborder.   The column suffered and inflicted a fewcasualties.  This was an isolated incident unconnected with the situation in North Waziristan.  The murderersof Captain Keogh have not yet been identified. Themurderers of Lt.Beatty have been identified as 8 members othe Madda Khel Wazir tribe;   3 of these have surrenderedas a result of action against the tribe but 5 are. still at large. The situation, in North Yvaziristan began to deteriorate again early in March.  The Tori Khel Wasir&apos;sjirga failed in their efforts to persuade the Faqir of Ipito leave their, limits and bands of hostile tribesmenbegan to collect again in the Khaisora and Shaktu Valleys.The cutting of telephone and telegraph lines becamefrequent and raiding gangs kidnapped several Hindus fromthe Bannu district.  On March 29th an attack was madebya large party of hostile tribesmen on the road protectingtroops near Damdil.     Our casualties were 23 killed including  2 british officers and 38 wounded.  The enemy  casualties were much larger.  Negotiations were proceeding at the  time betweenthe Utmanzai Wazir  jirga and the Faqir of Ipi.  these negotiations failed completely and on 5th April the wholeTori Khel Wazir tribe were placed under  a blockade.Portions of their country were also  subjected to air action.  On 9th April a gang o  Mahsuds  attacked a supplyconvoy  in Shahur  Tangi, a very narrow defile  between
Jagdola and Sarwekai in South Waziristan.  our casualties amounted to 29 killed, including 7 officers,and 45 wounded.  Since then the conditions in SouthWaziristan also have shown signs of deterioration.  Thepresent situation is that the faqir of Ipi is still in aTori Khel village in the Shaktu Valley and large parties of hostile tribesmen are collected in various placesseeking opportunities for mischief.  The troops inWaziristan have been reinforced and all possibleprecautionary measures are being taken.     On April 1st the new constitution came into effect in11 autonomous provinces and Burma ceased to be part ofthe Indian Empire.  As was mentioned in the Januaryappreciation, the Congress had resolved to promote a nation-wide hartal or 1 day strike on that day and widespread propaganda has been employed to make it a success.  Except in the United Provinces, however,itsobservance was usually a partial and perfunctory affairand aroused little interest.  The Moslems generally tookno part in it and such demonstrations as were stagedwere of a peaceful character.  The whole episodeillustrates   absence   of any real feeling in thecountry as a whole against the new constitution.     The new ministries were ready to take office in allprovinces on April 1st.  In the 5 provinces having alarge Moslem population, non-congress governments havebeen, formed with more or less stable majorities in theirlegislatures and have commenced work in favourable circumstances.   In the remaining 6 provinces, owing tothe refusal of the Coxigress party to take office whereit had a majority, it has been necessary to call onrepresentatives of the minority to form Governments andin every such case men of public spirit - many of &quot;them^already distinguished in the service of their provinces -
                                                     3.were forthcoming from the legislatures to accept theresponsibility which Congress had declined.     This situation was to a large extent unexpectedeven among Congress men.  When the so-called nationalconvention dispersed at Delhi in March it was generallyunderstood that the formula which Mr.Gandhi  had introduced into the Congress resolution had paved the way for Officeacceptance.    &quot;When, however, local leaders  of theCongress party &quot;were invited by Governors to  discuss theformation of Ministries the influence of the Control Boardsubsequently set up became apparent and each of theseleaders in turn expressed his inability to accept Officewithout a definite and specific assurance that theGovernor would make no use of the special powers assigned to him by the Government of India Act.  It was made clear in each case that a Congress Ministry could expect full support and sympathy from the Governor in carrying out its policy but, although time was given for reflection, office was in each, case declined in the absence of an assurancewhich it was constitutionally impossible to give.     It is not necessary to suppose that this result wasdeliberately planned by Mr.Gandhi or his associates.  Aloose formula was no doubt intentionally adopted at Delhiin order to avoid awkward questions and to  getdelegates away without a split.     In subsequently elaborating it into a  demand for an assurance from the  Governors, Mr. Gandhi, always an expert opportunist, managed to manoeuvre himself into hisfavourite position  where, without-definitely committing himself to the views of  either wing  of Congress, hecould make himself  appear to  be  in the right in the eyes of his followers whatever the ultimate outcome might be.If assurances were  refused he could  lay the blame atthe door  of  the  Governors: and  if the demand were
successful he could claim a constitutional victory whichwould save the face of Congress in accepting officeand pacify the left wing.  While it is always possiblethat in balancing the probabilities Mr.Gandhi may have over-estimated the bargaining power of Congress and the anxiety of the Governors to get Congress majorities towork the constitution at any price, it is difficult tobelieve that he was- under any illusion as to thepossibility of an undertaking by the Governors, theeffect of which would in fact have been to contract outof the Act.  At any rate whether the result has borne out his expectations or not the manoeuvre has been completely successful from his own point of view.     The wrath of his hoodwinked and disappointedfollowers of the right wing has been diverted against government and the minority ministries; the left wing is satisfied; and all sections of his followers are nowobliged to look to him to find a way out of the impasseinto which he has led them.     Meanwhile, the minority ministries are boldlyfacing their duties and are one by one announcingprogrammes which in themselves illustrate the scopeallowed them by the new  constitution.  The Congress,onthe other hand, are without means of satisfying thehopes they have raised amongst their electors and have little scope for action  except by way  of misrepresentingthe constitutional position and fomenting agrarian or industrial trouble, which may embarrass the newGovernments whether in majority or minority provinces.In the meantime, realising the weakness of Congresscontacts with the Moslem masses,  Jawahar Lai Nehru hasinitiated  strenuous propaganda to break the solidarityof the Moslems and induce the left wing of Moslem Leagueto join hands with Congress.  The  approaching session
of the Moslem. League at Lucknow will provide anopportunity for testing the effects of this propaganda.     In the midst of this political ferment, communaltrouble has unfortunately been more in evidence in many parts of India.  The recent coincidence of the MohamedanFestival of MuharramYjWiththe Hindu Festival of Holi,produced a number of difficult situations and some riots.The worst of these occurred at Panipat in the Punjab,where Moslems obstructed the passage of a Hinduprocession and a small body of police were compelled to open fire.  A number of casualties resulted,but promp action by the Punjab Government in instituting an authoritative enquiry on the spot averted more serious repercussions.  In some places the disputes between theSunni and the Shia sects of Mohamedans gave trouble durin the Muharram, and rioting has occurred in North-WestPunjab between Mohamedans and Sikhs.  The situation in Waziristan including the border raids in which Hindushave been kidnapped is also lending itself to communalexploitation in Northern India.     Among other difficulties with which the newProvincial Governments will&apos; have to deal is the tension between landlords and tenants which has long beenfomented by Kisan organisations under the directions of.Congress socialists and he,s locally been increased by congress propaganda during the elections.  During March,matters came to a head in parts of Bihar where the landlords, who have a,lways been supporters  of  Congress,are noted for their oppressive behaviour.  An  incisiveoutbreak  of lawlessness was averted by the  exertionsof the District Magistrate who found the tenantsreasonable enough although they were not ready to listen to Congress members/of the Legislative Assembly
who also attempted to intervene.  Communist and extremesocialist influences are also active in promotingindustrial unrest and. have attained some success in Calcutta where strikes,  not regarded as genuinelyeconomic in character, have been in progress in many ofthe jute mills since the beginning of March and have nowrendered 33 mills and 1,023,000 operatives idle.     Apart from these disturbing factors the country as a whole is peaceful and the great constitutional changes which have recently taken place have caused no general excitement.  Even in Congress, which relies for support largely upon the stabler elements of thepopulation, there is little indication of any desire to precipitate a clash with authority.  The new ministriestherefore take office in a tolerably calm atmosphere and while in the minority provinces it would be unwise to count at this stage on the prospects of their being ableto consolidate and maintain their Parliamentary positionin the face of Congress opposition it may be hoped thatthe constructive programmes with which they haveimmediately busied themselves will gain them a substantialdegree of confidence and support in their provinces.
