Printed for the Cabinet.  April 1937.Copy No.CABINET.INCREASING  THE  PRODUCTIVITY  OF  THE  SOIL.            Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland.    THE proposals  in CP. 117 (37), with  which I am for the most  part  inagreement, raise a particular issue of great importance as regards Scotland.    The Inter-Departmental Committee recommend the raising of the limit  tothe &quot;anticipated supply&quot;  under the Wheat Act from 6 million to 8 millionquarters with a view to giving greater assurance  to farmers in respect of theirreturns from wheat and thereby stimulating an increase in the wheat acreage.    The representatives of my Department pointed out, however (see the footnoteon page  5 of the Paper),  that the proposal, however desirable in itself, to give further assistance in respect of wheat would create difficulties if no assistancewere provided for Scottish oat-growers.  The Committee&apos;s Supplementary Reportdiscussed the possibilities of providing such assistance.    I  think it  desirable to circulate for the consideration of my colleagues astatement making my position in this matter clear.    It has been generally recognised ever since the War  that a major point  in agricultural policy should be the  encouragement of land under the plough.  TheBeet Sugar subsidy and the Wheat Act are two cardinal measures in point.  Theyhave had in England a most pronounced effect in safeguarding arable  farmersagainst the disasters  of the agricultural depression.  For climatic reasons Scotlandcannot derive anything like the same advantage from these measures.   Expressedin terms of money, her receipts from her share of the Wheat subsidy are only about 6 per cent., and of  the Beet subsidy less than 2 per cent.  Yet the policyof the plough is no less necessary for Scotland than for England.  It is in both countries essential for the production of young grass, or, in other words, for the productivity of the  land on  which our livestock are bred and fed.  I- need notlabour this point.    Five years&apos; experience of the Wheat and Beet subsidies shows that Scotlandmust still depend on oats as her staple &quot; white crop.&quot;  Scotland has one-third ofthe total acreage under oats in Great Britain.  It seems improbable that scotland will participate to any extent in any increase of acreage under wheat arisingfrom the proposal in CP.  117 (37).    It would  seem  then  that we must  either announce  now that  we cannotformulate  any  cereal policy for Scotland,  or  must devise some measure  of insurance for oats for the whole country, or  for  Scotland alone:   That presentmeasures fail to secure a  reasonable price stability is sufficiently clear.  Only ayear ago the market price of oats reached 15s. a quarter  as against 25s. to-day,and the  Scottish producer has no security that it will not reach a similar low level within the next year or two, i.e., within the  next crop rotation.    I  am most  anxious to further any policy designed to increase arable acreage,but I  should be failing in my duty if  I assented to a  proposal  which wouldaccentuate the discrepancy between the  two  countries which admittedly  existsat  presesnt, because of the difficulties of  devising a satisfactory scheme for theassistance of oat and barley growers on a Great Britain basis.       [15124]SECRETCP. 125 (37).
     If no general scheme is found to be feasible, then,! feel that another line of approach must be considered, namely, a separate allocation to Scotland of funds to be applied to  an arable policy appropriate to her conditions.  This could be fully justified on general merits, since the shortage  of home-produced feeding-s,tuffsrhas;.been the subject of much anxiety.  Oats is one article of this group, and since our imports of the main feeding-stuffs have increased by some 1 \ million tonssince 1913, while in the same period our production of the three cereal crops hasdiminished by about 900,000 tons, it cannot be held that there is no room on themarket for a maintained, or  even an increased, quantity of home-grown oats.     There is no lack of precedent, even in agricultural matters,  for the adoptionof measures designed for  the special needs of one part of the country only.  Forexample, conditions in Engla-nd have necessitated the expenditure of large sums of money on arterial drainage and  flood prevention  which  have quite properlynever been considered for Scotland, where for the most part there have only been small grants for field and hill drainage.  I think that there should be no difficulty,in principle,  in defending a separate method of treatment of the cereal problem.     If my colleagues  should  feel that the objections to a  general scheme such asthat discussed in the Supplementary Report  are insuperable, then  I would ask that the possibilities of a separate Scottish scheme should be fully explored before any  announcement is made  of  the proposal  regarding wheat, which  would inevitably be regarded as closing the door to any measure for dealing with theNorthern position, which has now for so long been argued by Scottish members and  by deputations.o,  ,&apos;                                                           w.
