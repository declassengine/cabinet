The Indian Provincial Elections.MEMORANDUM BY  THE  SECRETARY  OF STATE  FOR INDIA.   I circulate for the information of my colleagues a confidential Memorandum-which I  have received  from the Government of India.  1 am intending to publishin the near future a White Paper which will contain detailed statistical information.This Memorandum gives a good general appreciation of the results of the elections.   The elections were conducted on the whole with remarkable smoothness, thoughnaturally a severe strain was put upon the district authorities who, without  relief from their ordinary work, were  called  upon to make the arrangements and  to supervise  the polling  of an immense  electorate, the majority  of whom  werevoting  for the first time in their live3.   Inevitably, there has  heen a considerabledislocation of district  work,  and this may have a bad  effect on  the  criminaladministration and  on the duration of trials in court.   There  have been reportstoo of  damage to roads by the numerous motor  lorries  used for taking electorsto the  polls which  it will take some time to repair.  The number of candidateswho stood for election was great, and enormous sums of money have been put intocirculation.   Many candidates have  spent  more money than they can really  affordand will probably not be  anxious  to stand for election again.  In every Provincesome incidents of rowdyism occurred,  and the election  tactics of parties, not least of all the Congress,  were not  always scrupulous.  In spite of this, however, reportsshow that throughout India, even  where Congress candidates were  returned with large majorities, the relations  between the polling staff  and police and the  votorshave been excellent, without any trace of animosity, and great credit is reflected onthe authorities entrusted with the carrying out of a difficult task.    The outstanding result of the election  has  been the large measure of successattained  by the Congress.  Primarily their success has  been  due to organisation,both internal and external.  Internally, at  least for  the duration of  the  elections,the &quot; higher command &quot; of the party succeeded  in maintaining  a  strict disciplineover Congress candidates.  Malcontents or members who stood in  opposition to official candidates were severely  dealt with  and expelled from  the party, and,although there is reason to believe that a number of candidates who stood on  theCongress ticket were not in full sympathy with Congress  aims,  no qualification ofthe Congress electoral programme was permitted.  Discipline  among other partiesopposed to Congress has been, at  least in Provinces where Congress has securedan absolute majority, equally conspicuous by its  absence. In  many instances amultiplicity of candidates have contested one  seat, and  there  is reason  to believethat a  number of candidates stood merely in order to secure a bargaining counterfor their  subsequent withdrawal.   The  Congress majorities,  however, have been generally big enough to win the seats even had the opposing  parties succeeded inputting  forward only one  candidate  for  each  seat, and  in  some Provinces  thenumber of non-Congress  candidates who forfeited their deposits  was remained-kable.For example, in Bihar over 50 per cent, of non-Congress candidates  forfeited theirdeposits.   This lack of  cohesion  and failure to sink local jealousies and rivalrieshas effectively prevented any agreed programme in opposition  to Congress.    Externally also the Congress were  the only  organised party in  the field. Whereas candidates of other parties, if they carried  out any extensive  canvassing at all,  had. of ten to  rely on what hired agents they could muster and little reliance could  in many cases be placed on such agents the Congress had large  numbers of unpaid or low-paid volunteers to  assist  them in  their propaganda.

others of all-India reputation  cannot he over-estimated.  Their  result may  be short-lived, but their immediate effect was very great.  In this respect the congress were greatly helped by the different dates of the elections in the various Provinces,which allowed their leaders to pay attention to  each in turn.   Throughout theelections have shown the value to an electoral cause of men of all-India reputation.By appealing  to party pride these leaders were able in their  tours  to stop for thetime being the disintegrating  effects of  local  rivalries.   It is noticeable, however,that where there was an organisation to oppose them, the Congress did not fare sowell. Thus in the eastern rural districts of the Punjab, where, under the  leadership of Rao Bahadur Chhotu  Ram, a political organisation has been  built up in pastyears, the electorate, largely consisting  of Jats,  Rajputs, Ahirs  and  Gajars,  stillpreferred their tribal leaders and rejected  every  Congress candidate, although inthe adjourning rural districts of the United Provinces with a population of much the  same type, the  Congress  were largely successful.    In  certain areas of theCentral Provinces the aboriginal tribes also preferred  their own  local  candidates,presumably because of  their natural  conservatism,  or  because  their country is comparatively inaccessible  to widespread propaganda  from outside.   Generallyspeaking, however, the elections have shown conclusively that individuals, howeverinfluential and public-spirited, who rely on their local prestige and position alone,cannot stand up against organised propaganda  and  an  organised  party, howeverunknown and  insignificant may be the candidate nominated by the party.    An estimate must be made of the extent to which the Congress majorities reflect the real opinion of the electorate on the issue  of independence and  the wrecking ofthe new Constitution, the declared aim of the Congress Party.  There  can be nodoubt that the name of the Congress, with its historical record of patriotic effort andthe  all-India reputation of many of its leaders, has a wide appeal to Hindus, if notindeed to Indians as a whole.   The strength of this appeal  should not  be under-estimated, and must largely account for the total of votes cast in favour of Congresscandidates.  The majorities show  that many people, including officials, in town and country, who cannot conceivably have any sympathy for revolutionary policies, musthave voted for the Congress.  Apart, however, from this general appeal, there were other and perhaps more important causes for the  success of Congress.   In certainProvinces there were local reasons ; for  example, in Madras the opposite party, the justice  or non-Brahman  party, have been in  office for 15 years,  and the electoratemay well have wished for a change.  In Bihar some of the less backward electorsare  reported to have voted for Congress  because they had found that forced labourand other  illegal exactions imposed  by landlords had decreased as  a resrdt ofKisan agitation.   In India as a whole there cannot be the least doubt that many ofthe  electorate who voted  for the first time were unfitted to exercise the franchiseintelligently.  Many had little notion of  what  the election was about. In backwardrural areas the  Congress  propaganda  in the main  took two forms, the first adeclaration that a vote for Congress meant a vote for Mr. Gandhi, and the  second themaking of the wildest and most irresponsible promises, coupled with violent attacks upon Government and upon the landlords.   Reports  have come in from manyProvinces that villagers were told that  the Congress voting box was the  Gandhibox, or  even  the  &quot; sarkari &quot;  or Government  box.   The  Congress  volunteerssucceeded in  arousing a  wave of pro-Gandhi . frenzy.   Villagers in  some   con-stituencies  were  informed that all ballot papers dropped into  the Congress boxwould go straight to Mahatma Gandhi,  and  that persons who voted in this way would  secure  large reductions in  rent, while  persons  who voted against theCongress would lose their lands altogether.  They were also  told that the victory of the Congress  box would be followed by the repeal of unpopular laws.   Thesestories  were  so  implicitly  believed that  many  voters came to  look upon theCongress box as invested with  supernatural qualities.  In some  instances prayerswere made to the box, and letters and petitions to Mr. Gandhi, and even sums ofmoney, were found in the box.   In Orissa, some villagers believed that if congress were successful Mr. Gandhi would become Maharaja.  An  electorate such as thisfell an easy prey to promises of wholesale rent remission, only at present preventedhy the  presence  of  the British  Government in India and the Constitution whichthey were imposing upon India, and of  remission  from taxation and cancellation ofdebts.   Force was lent to these promises by the fact that Government, as a neutral,issued  no  refutation.  In  Bihar,  reports  showed that the old  electorate  were inclined to support their old candidates,  and the new  electorate voted for  Congress,propaganda being directed more against the landlords than against Government.
   Governments  attitude of neutrality  has been  an  important factor  in  theelectious.   The debates in the Legislative Assembly on  Government interference in the elections have in certain cases been used to overawe subordinate government servants.  The Congress have been at pains to show that in this election there arebut two parties, the Congress and Government.   This  fits in entirely with thevillager&apos;s  view of  the position,  since he has come to  look  upon  Congress assynonymous with sedition.  It passed his comprehension that Government shouldnot interfere against the Congress  unless Government were  afraid of that party.Congress were not slow to take advantage of  this belief ;  meetings were held nearGovernment offices  and police stations ; speeches were as seditious as they couldbe without incurring  the  certainty of prosecution,  and  every effort  was made toshow  that  power had  passed  or  was about  to  pass from the Government to theCongress.  Moreover, the  villager is not alone in his  mystification.  Many parties and persons  who  have  supported  Government in the  past cannot  understandGovernments neutrality in this election.   The villager, trained by circumstance to respect power, voted for the party who appeared at the moment to  possess power.   It would,  therefore, probably be true to say that the Congress majorities do not reflect the real opinion  of the electorate on the declared aims of the Congress Party,but it is equally true  that the elections have made a wide, if still a not very deep,impression upon the countryside.    There has been a stirring of political conscious-ness.  Discontent  has  been roused, hatred  of Government  and  of the landlordswidely preached, and hopes raised of a golden age.   Reports received  immediatelyafter the elections from some Provinces, and in particular in the United Provinces,seemed to indicate that there had been a marked deterioration in the attitude of thepeople towards Government.  Subsequent  reports, however,  received after theactual excitement had subsided, have been reassuring.  The prestige of the Congresshas been  greatly  enhanced,  but mainly  at  the expense of  the  landlords, whoseinfluence may have been permanently impaired.  There is no reason to  suppose thatthe authority of the district officers has suffered appreciably, though there have beenreports  of  a growing tendency  in some Provinces  for cultivators to take  theirgrievances to the local  Congress leaders or members  of the Legislature  who give outthat reports made to them will receive the attention of the district authorities.  Towhat extent  Congress  will be able further to foment unrest is at present a matter for conjecture.   What  has been  said  in  the  previous  paragraphs  applies  mainly to  generalconstituencies in Provinces in which Congress  has  secured an absolute majoritj\Only in Sind and in the North-West Frontier Province were religious issues raised.In these Provinces results turned largely on  individual  personalities,  rivalries andtribal loyalties, although in the Peshawar and Mardan constituencies the issue  uponwhich  the election was fought was clear-cut, Redshirts against the rest.   In  mostof these constituencies the Redshirts  won with clear majorities.  In the Muslimconstituencies in the Punjab general  questions of policy counted little, and electorschose their local leaders.  In Sikh  and  Hindu constituencies  election propagandawas, however,  directed against  Government.    In  spite  of some  unexpectedCongress successes in  the towns, the Unionist Party secured a  clear majority, andthe failure of Congress in the rural  areas of the  Punjab was remarkable.   TheCongress  successes in the towns were almost  entirely  won at the expense of theNationalist  Progressive  Party representing  the  Hindus of  the  Hindu Sabhaschool.   As in the  Central Provinces, the feelings of the Congress  against  thisparty were  very  bitter indeed, and prominent  men   such  as  Pandit  Mad anMohan  Malaviya  and  others failed  to  secure a  hearing at Amritsar,  Lahoreand  elsewhere, their  meetings being broken up on  almost every  occasion by congress supporters.  In  Bengal,  Congress  won more  seats  than was expected.Although, there is reason to  believe that Fazlul  Haq and the Proja Party  weresupported  by the Congress, the  risk of Congress claiming hegemony on the scoreof numbers has acted as a stimulus to efforts  to secure Muslim unity, and FazlulHaq appears, for the  time being, to have thrown over  his  Congress supporters.One  noticeable feature of the  elections has been the  general rejection  of Congresscandidates by Muslim voters and  the partial failure of Congress in scheduled casteconstituencies.  In Bombay, Congress secured only 4 out  of 15 scheduled caste  seatsand in Bengal 7 out of 30.  Although the capture of 5 out of 8 Labour constituencies in Bengal  by Communists indicates a marked swing to the left, extremists andadvocates of expropriation have, so far as can be judged at present, not receivedmuch  support.  Two Communist  revolutionaries  have been returned   to  the
extremist  Congress Akali  group in  the  Punjab, and among all  the successfulCongress candidates in Bihar, only 7 represent. the  Socialist or Kisan movement.   Information regarding  the voting for Upper Houses is at present meagre.  InBihar, in spite of the sweeping victory of Congress in the Assembly elections, noCongress candidate was elected  by direct  election, and  in the United Provinces,Assam and Bengal the Congress majorities in the Lower Houses have not been reflected in the Upper Houses.   The results, however, in Bombay and Madras showthat Congress appeal  to the upper class electorate is strong in these Provinces.6H5   Wt8177/PB 85 5.37 100
