Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.    WITH reference to the Memorandum on Battersea  Power Station by theMinister of Transport (CP. 131 (37)), I desire to inform the Cabinet that thedefence aspects of this project have recently been examined by the  Committee ofImperial Defence.    2.  A Report by the Home Defence Committee is attached as  Annex &quot; A,&quot;and the relevant  extract from the  draft Minutes of the Committee of ImperialDefence is attached as Annex &quot; B.&quot;    3.  From the latter it will be seen that the Committee of Imperial defence agreed        To advise the Ministry of Transport and the Home  Office (Air Raid    Precautions  Department) that the Committee of Imperial Defence  do not    consider that any  action  should now be taken to  prevent  the  proposed    extension to  Battersea Power Station, but that Government approval to the    extension should be made conditional upon the taking of  adequate air raid    precautionary measures.

                      THIRD INTERIM  REPORT.            PROPOSED EXTENSION OF BATTERSEA  POWER STATION.    THE Electricity Commission have drawn the attention of the Air RaidPrecautions Department  to a  proposal  submitted  to  them  by  the  central electricity Board for the  extension of the new Battersea Power Station of theLondon Power Company, by the installation of an additional 75,000  K.W.generating set, together with the necessary  ancillary plant.    2   The Air  Raid Precautions Department informed the Electricity Corn-mission that from the point of view of protection against air attack it appearedto be highly undesirable that productive capacity on the scale of the proposedenlarged station should be  concentrated on  such a vulnerable site.    3   The Electricity Commission have replied that it had always been theintention  that the site should be developed to its full capacity, subject to theemission of sulphur fumes being obviated  satisfactorily.   The  Commissionsubmitted the  attached  memorandum* and  said they hoped  that  no objectionwould be lodged to their proceeding at once with the consideration of the presentapplication.    4.   The Sub-Committee are of opinion that the concentration of electricitystations of great power  on the  line of  the  Thames is  very disturbing, and recommend that the  attention of  the Committee of Imperial Defence should bedrawn  to  the dangers inherent in the proposed extension of Battersea power station.    5.   If,  as  appears probable from the  Memorandum  submitted  by  theElectricity Commission, it is now too late  to take  any action to prevent theextension  of the Power Station, we strongly recommend that pressure should beexerted  to ensure  adequate measures of air raid precautions  being  taken in thenew installation, particularly in the manner of local dispersion, duplication, andbomb or splinter-proofing of vital points.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee :              E. .1.

                         ELECTRICITY COMMISSION.         London Power Company, Limited Battersea Power Station.    WITH a view to the concentration of generation in a limited number of inter-connected  stations  to  be termed &quot;selected&quot;  stations,  the  Electricity(Supply) Act, 1926, made provision  for the preparation, adoption and carryingout of schemes  of technical development,  and placed on  the  Electricity  Com-missioners  the duty of preparing such schemes for transmission to the central electricity Board dealing with the  following matters :  (a) determining  whatgenerating stations,  whether  existing or  new stations, are to be  &quot; selected &apos;&apos;stations at which electricity is to be generated for the purposes of the central board;  and (b)  providing for the interconnection of these stations with eachother  and with the systems of  authorised undertakers.    2.  Following the passing of the Act of 1926 the Commissioners proceeded to prepare Regional  Schemes for various  parts  of  the  Country;  and on the20th September,  1927, they transmitted to the Central Electricity Board a Schemefor the  South-East England Area, which, inter alia, specified and  determinedcertain existing  generating stations to be &quot; selected &quot; stations, and specified thenew generating  stations  which should,  if  and when duly authorised, become&quot; selected &quot; stations.    3.  This Scheme, which was ultimately adopted by the Central electricity board, specified  as one of the  new selected stations, the Battersea Station of theLondon Power Company, Limited, to be designed as a capital station, the firstsection to comprise an installation of not less than 120,000 K.W.  of generatingplant  ultimately to be extended to a total installation of 360,000 K.W.    4.  While this Scheme was in  course of  preparation,  the London power company in February 1927 notified the Commissioners of their intention to make an application for consent to the establishment of a new generating  station on ariverside site at Battersea;  that the designs  of the station  contemplated  an ultimate capacity  of  450,000  K.V.A.  (or 360,000 K.W.);  that  the  station was required to meet the future demands of their Constituent Companies;  and thatthe Company had in mind that such  a station might eventually become a selectedstation under a Scheme adopted under the  Electricity (Supply) Act,  1926.    5.  Subsequently,  the Company submitted a  formal  application  for theconsent  of  the Commissioners under Section 11 of the Electricity (Supply) Act,1919;  and at the same time submitted a similar application to the commissioners of Works, whose approval to the erection of the station was also necessary underthe provisions of the London Electric Supply Act, 1908, which related, inter alia,to the protection of royal palaces, parks,  public buildings, &amp;c, from nuisancecaused by the non-consumption of smoke and other operations of any generating station of an authorised undertaker  in the Administrative County of London.    6.  On receipt of the application, the Commissioners notified  the  Ministryof Health  and also showed the plans and drawings  of the site and station to representatives of the Air Ministry.   No objections were received from either ofthese  Departments.    7.  At the  same time, the Company complied with  the  Memorandum ofProcedure  laid  down by  the  Commissioners, by notifying the  London CountyCouncil, Battersea Borough Council, H.M. Office of Works, and certain  other interested bodies and persons of their application.    8.  As a result certain representations were made to the Commissioners, andon the 21st June, 1927, the Commissioners held an Inquiry into the applicationat their Offices at Savoy Court.    9.  After giving consideration to the  representations  received by them, theCommissioners on the. 27th October,  1927, gave their consent to the construction
of the station on the Battersea Site to contain initially 120,000 K.W. of generatingplant, subject to certain conditions for the prevention of nuisance  arising fromgrit, smoke, dust and sulphur.    10.   In the following year the Farnworth case drew attention to the possibledestructive effects of sulphur fumes emitted from the chimneys of electric power stations; and this gave rise to apprehensions in the case of the Battersea Station(then in course of construction) as to the possible effect on public amenities and health, and formed the subject of  a number of questions in Parliament.    11.   As a result, Lord Londonderry, the  then First Commissioner of Works,gave an undertaking in April 1929 that the question of any further extension ofthe Battersea Station would come  within the purview of Parliament;  that ifobjections were brought forward that the station was not working satisfactorily,Parliament would have the opportunity of expressing its opinion whether  thestation  should be  further extended;  and  that  this  undertaking  should be implemented  by consultation between the Minister of Transport and the first commissioner of Works, so that  steps could be taken to draw the attention ofboth Houses to the matter.    12.   It is not the object of this Memorandum to detail or review the steps which were taken to investigate and report on the measures to be adopted at theBattersea Station, except to state  that the London Power Company have adopted a system of gas washing plant,  the results  of which under  ordinary working conditions  have satisfied  the Government  Chemist&apos;s  Committee  and  other interested bodies.    13.   This being the case, the  Commissioners, after  consultation with  theDepartments concerned, have issued consents to  the further extensions  of  thestation as follows :     (i)  April 1933 to the  installation of  one 100,000 K.W. turbo-alternator          set; and    (ii)  May 1935 to the installation of three boiler units having an evaporative          capacity of 300,000/375,000 lb. of steam  per hour.    14.   It is important to observe that at no stage has  there been any seriouschallenge  that it would be wrong in principle that is from the technical andeconomic standpoint to build a station  on the  Battersea site of an ultimatecapacity of the order of 360,000/400,000 K.W. to meet the growing load in theWest London Area which this station will serve.    15.   The estimates of the demand in the South-East England Area preparedby the Commissioners when the Scheme for this area was propounded, and theproportion of the  load to  be allocated to the Battersea  Station as and whenextended  have not,  so far  as the  Commissioners  are aware, been adverselycriticised.    16.   The  Central Electricity Board have to review estimates  of  growthyearly, and  in a statement submitted in October last,  which is based  on  theactual records up to that date, the  demand in the South-East England Area in1939 is estimated at nearly 100,000 K.W. in excess of the figures upon which theGrid Tariff Estimates were based.    17.   The Commissioners have reviewed the position disclosed by these figures and  the  proposals   by the  Central  Electricity   Board  for  plant  extensions,including a new generating unit  at  Battersea  Power Station, and they  aresatisfied  on technical and  economic grounds as to the  desirability of theseproposals.    18.   As already stated, the Battersea Station was designed from the outsetfor the  ultimate installation of plant  of  about 360,000 K.W.  and such an expensive site could  never have been justified if the plant had to be limited tothe present capacity.    19.   The  first half of  the station has cost  approximately  24 per  K.W.installed, whereas the ultimate cost of the completed  station would be only about 17 per K.W. installed.
    20.  It is  clear,  therefore,  that  if the Station is restricted to its presentcapacity, the difference in cost of  7 per K.W. or  1,500,000 will  be capitalrendered idle.    21.  The immediate need  of the proposed  extension  as outlined  in theCommissioners&apos; letter of the 30th October, 1936,* to the Home Office  (Air  RaidPrecautions Department) is for a standby generating unit.  The main generatingplant at present  installed consists of two 64,000 K.W. and one 100,000 K.W.sets and nine boilers.  With two boilers out of commission (which is  considered a reasonable provision in such a station) the remaining seven boilers are capableof supplying steam for the generation of 200,000-220,000 K.W., but if  the largestturbine breaks down for any reason, the station output would have to  be reducedto 128,000  K.W.    22.  Although such a  shortage  of output at Battersea can and would bemet to-day by bringing into use spare plant in other stations, it is not a condition which could be allowed to continue after 1939, without spending a large amountof capital  on the main transmission system,  which  would have the effect ofincreasing  the cost of electricity.    23.  The economic necessity  for large generating stations in the central london Area was proved conclusively at the Enquiries held by the Commissionersinto the proposals to establish the Battersea Station and  to extend the FulhamStation.  Nothing which  has  since transpired  has  in  any way altered theconclusions then reached.  The present proposal represents one stage in the logicaldevelopment of the Schemes then put forward.    24.  As regards  the  contention that   riverside  stations are speciallyvulnerable in case of hostile air raids, it should be pointed out that the proposed extension of the Battersea Station is really a new building and  can be designed as far as possible with a view to  minimising the effect of damage.    25.  In view of the rapidly increasing demand for electricity in the london area   it is  essential that additional plant should be available  by  the autumn of 1939.    26.  Under the conditions prevailing at the present time  in the steel industry,plant of the type proposed cannot be manufactured and brought into use in lessthan 1\ to 3 years from the date of  order, and it is imperative, therefore, thatany steps necessary to safeguard  the position  in the Autumn of  1939 should betaken at once.    27.  In view of the foregoing remarks,  the Commissioners strongly urge that no obstacle should be placed in the way of this proposal.December 31, 1936.* Not reproduced.
Extract from the Draft Minutes of the 293rd Meeting of the Committee of                          Imperial Defence.(3) PROTECTION  OF  POINTS  OF  IMPORTANCE  AGAINST  AIR        ATTACK.   PROPOSED EXTENSION OF BATTERSEA POWER        STATION                        (C.I.D. Paper No.  254-A.)    THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Memorandum by the HomeDefence Committee, covering a Report  of a Sub-Committee on the  proposed extension of Battersea Power Station (C.I.D.  Paper No. 254-A).    WING COMMANDER HODSOLL, introducing the Report, said that he felt it was now too late to take any action to prevent the extension of the power station. It would have been necessary to take any such action about 10 years ago.He hoped, however, that the machinery which was now in existence, namely, a central Committee of the Electricity Commission with regional Sub-Committees,would provide information in sufficient time for  the requisite action to be takenin such cases in future.    In reply  to Mr. Chamberlain, he said that he thought it would be possibleto prevent extensions taking place in vulnerable areas, provided action was takenin time. In the case of Battersea Power Station,  although the site was restricted,there was quite a lot which could be done by way of passive defence measures.                               CONCLUSION.    THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed         To advise the Ministry  of Transport and the Home Office (Air  Raid    Precautions  Department) that the  Committee of Imperial Defence do not    consider  that  any action should now be taken  to  prevent the proposed    extension to  Battersea Power Station, but that Government approval to the    extension should be made conditional upon the taking  of adequate air raid    precautionary measures.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,      April 29,  1937.
