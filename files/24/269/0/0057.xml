; THIS pgCUMglgL IS  THE  PROPERTY 017  HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT.1521371CABINET.COPY NOEXTENSION OF THE MILK ACTS, 1934 AND 1956.       MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE ANDFISHERIES AND&apos;THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND.1,        The Milk Act, 1934, provided assistance to the milk industry in the United Kingdom for a period of two years by means of exchequer payments &quot;in respect of milk used for manufacture into certain milk products, including butter and cheese,  as under the ottawa and foreign trade agreements we were precluded fromproviding equivalent assistance by way of duties.   For GreatBritain the rate of Exchequer payment was such that, provided thatthe Milk Marketing Boards were able to sell the milk at a price notless than a &quot;cheese milk price&quot; calculated in accordance with a formula in the Act, the total returns of the Boards on milk used for manufacture were brought up to a &quot;standard price&quot; of 3d. a gallon inthe summer months and 6d. per gallon in winter.2.        The Milk (Extension of Temporary Provisions) Act, 1936,extended the period of these payments to the 30th September, 1937.At the time when the 1936 Act was passed, it was hoped that theReport&apos;of the Great Britain Milk Reorganization Commission wouldbe available early in the summer of 1936 and that it-would be .possible to pass by the summer of 1937 legislation embodyingpermanent proposals regarding the dairy industry.  The Report ofthe Reorganization Commission was not in fact available until theend of 1936 and the recommendations of that body have covered avery wide field, and have been the subject of considerablecontroversy.   Whilst, therefore, we hope shortly to be in aposition to submit to our colleagues proposals for a long termmilk policy, it is clear that there will not be time to pass legislation to give effect to any such proposals before Parliamentadjourns for the summer recess.1.
 3,        We accordingly seek the concurrence of our colleagues to the preparation of a Bill to extend the period of the Milk Act payments in respect of manufacturing milk, pending the coming into operation of the Government&apos;s long term policy.   We feel that the case for this measure of assistance to the industry to-day is the same as that which led to the passing of the 1934 act.   Whilst prices of milk for manufacture have risen somewhat in recent months, the producers&apos; returns have not teen increased thereby since the rate of Exchequer payments have fallen correspondingly. On the other hand costs of milk production have risen appreciably during the last 12 months owing chiefly to-an increase in the cost of labour and feeding stuffs, and whilst no reliable figures as to the exact extent of this increase in costs are yet available,  the fact that there has been an appreciable increase cannot be disputed.   We anticipate that the Bill to embody theGovernment&apos;s long term policy will be introduced and passed into law by the summer of 1938 and we suggest, therefore,that a temporary Bill should extend the period for Exchequer payments in respect of milk used for manufacture for a further year,  i,e. until the 30th September,  1938. 4,        We should propose to take advantage of the opportunity of removing certain anomalies in the operation of the 1954 Act.For example, we  have been advised by the Law Officers of the Crown that as the Act  is drafted we must,  for the purpose of ascertaining the payments due  to the Milk Board,  calculate the net cost of the milk in a way which would not correspond with its truerealisation value, and in consequence the English Milk Marketing board would be entitled to claim from the Exchequer in respect of the two years ended 31st March,  1936,  an extra sum estimated at  140,000.We feel that it  is clearly necessary to amend the Act so as to restore what was the original understanding with the Milk Boards as to the calculation of these payments.                            2.
5^        Another anomaly has arisen out of disputes between the milk Boards and the manufacturers as to the price to he paid for milk for manufacture.   These disputes were referred to theCommittees of Investigation for England and Wales and for Scotlandrespectively, and as a result of recommendations of these committees which after communications from the Ministers the Milk Boards haveimplemented, the price of milk for manufacture into butter and intocheese has been reduced considerably below the &quot;cheese milk price&quot;calculated in accordance with the Act, and in consequence the Milk Boards have been getting less than the standard prices.   This is contrary to the original intention as expressed in a statement on milk policy which the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries made inthe House of Commons on the  2nd February, 1934,  when he said &quot;TheGovernment accordingly proposes that for the two years beginning1st April, 1934, the Milk Marketing Boards shall be guaranteed bythe Government hy means of Exchequer advances, minimum prices of5d. per gallon in summer (April to September) and 6d. per gallonin winter, in respect of milk manufactured in factories in GreatBritain&quot;.6,         We feel,  therefore, that the Milk Boards have a strong-case for the modification of the present &quot;cheese milk price&quot; formulain the Act which is made all the stronger by the fact that, as explained in paragraph 4 above,  we are proposing amendments of theAct which would restore the original intention in another respect inorder to save the Excl^equer from a liability that was never intended.We  think that the present-anomaly could, best be removed by providing that as from October 1937 there  shall be substituted for the present statutory &quot;cheese milk price&quot; such price as Ministers,  with the consentof the Treasury, may determine as that for which the greatest partof the milk used for manufacture into cheese in Great Britain mighthave been sold,  with a proviso that,  as regards milk manufacturedinto butter,  there  shall be substituted a price similarly determinedas that for which the greatest part of the milk used for manufacture   into    butter   might   have   been   sold.
It  is estimated that as aresult of such a concession, the amountpayable by the Exchequer to the Milk Marketing Boards  of Great britain for the year October 1937 to September 1938 would  be  increased fromapproximately  67,000 to approximately  476,000.   We  feel  that,  quite apart  from the  question of the  justice of  the Milk Boards&apos;  claim that we should  revert to the intention of  the 1934 Act to  guarantee the standard price, the extra  assistance  is  justified on  its meritsin view of the  recent  increase  in  costs  of production to  which  wehave referred in paragraph 3 above.7.  Repayments  to the Exchequer... Under the present Acts,  if in  any month  during a  period  ending September 1939  the  &quot;cheese milk price&quot;exceeds the standard price by  more than  Id.,  then on every gallonof milk manufactured in such a month into one  of the products whichhave been the  subject  of Exchequer payments,  the Milk Boards mustpay to the Exchequer a  sum representing  the excess of the &quot;cheese milkprice&quot; over the standard price increased by a  Id.  The length of theperiod during which this  contingent liability for repayment exists isequal  to  that  of the period  during which payments to the  Milk Boardscan be made.  We suggest, therefore, that  the  proposed extension ofthe payment period should be balanced by a corresponding  addition tothe repayment period, as  it was in the  1936 extending Act, i.e, that .the period  during which the Milk Boards  are under a contingent liability to make repayments should now  be extended to the 30thSeptember, 1940.  We also suggest  that  the modification of the  &quot;cheesemilk price&quot; formula suggested  in paragraph 6 above should apply to the repayment provisions.  That is  to  say in respect of the period  from october 1937 any repayment on  milk manufactured  into a milk product--her  than butter should be governed by  the  new  &quot;cheese milk price&quot;,*nd any repayment  on milk manufactured into butter should be governedprice&apos;For the year October 1937by the proposed new &quot;butter milkSeptember 1938 this would have the effect of reducing the  estimated  re-Payments of the Milk Boards from approximately  48,000 to  approximately 6,C0C^74.
8.   Northern Ireland.     The 1934 and the 1936 Acts made provision for payments to the Government of NorthernIreland in respect of milk manufactured into&quot; butter andcream at registered creameries but we understand that theTreasury do not propose that these payments should becontinued for a longer period than that covered by existing legislation.   No provision as to Northern Ireland would,therefore, be made in the Bill.9.   Schemes for increasing the demand for milk.   The Acts of1934 and 1936,in addition to providing assistance in respectof milk used for manufacture, also made available exchequer grants not exceeding  1-g- million in the aggregate forschemes for increasing the demand for milk during a periodof approximately 3 years, which comes to an end on the 30thSeptember, 1937.   The most important of these schemes is the milk-in-Schools Scheme, under which children attending grant-aided schools are able to get milk at half price.   We feel that these schemes should clearly be extended for a further year,and that the maximum Exchequer grant for a further year shouldhe fixed at  500,000, which corresponds to the rate of grant for the previous 3 years,10.  Minor Amendments.      We would also propose to takeadvantage of the Extending Bill to make a few drafting amendments to the original Act, hut we need not troiible our colleagues with the details of these amendments.                       SUMMARY.11.       To sum up we ask for the concurrence of our colleagues to the preparation of a Bill to extend for afurther year, until 30th September, 1938, the period duringwhich Exchequer advances may be made under the Milk Acts1934 and 1936 in respect of milk used for manufacture andalso to provide for further Exchequer grants on existinglines for the Milk-in-Schools Schemes and other schemes for increasing t he demand for milk.   It is hoped that before                         5.
the end of the year to he covered hy the proposed extendingAct a measure to give effect to the Government!s long termmilk policy wilt be on the Statute Book.  We. propose thatthe present Bill should be drafted on the principle ofadhering as closely as possible to trie original  intention ofthe 1934 Act.   This will involve:-     (a)  ; Rectification of difficulties caused  by advice which we have received from the I,aw Officers of  the Crown asto the interpretation of certain provisions of the 1934 Act.     (b)  A modification of the present formula  for the &quot;cheesemilk price&quot;which governs both the rate of payment to the milk Boards, and the rate of repayment by the Milk Boards,  inrespect of milk used for manufacture.     (c)  Extending for an additional year the period duringwhich the Milk Boards are contingently liable to make payments to the Exchequer.     (d)  Provision of  500,000 for the purpose  of exchequer grants for milk-in-schools and other schemes for increasingthe demand for milk during the year of extension.          It is not proposed to continue the payments inrespect of milk manufactured in Northern Ireland.          It will be necessary to pass the Bill  into law before the House rises for the summer recess.                                     W.S.M.
