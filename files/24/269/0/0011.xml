March 1937.SECRET.CP. 106 (37).                                              Copy No.. .4fcQ.                                 CABINET.                     Provincial Ministries  in India.     MEMORANDUM BY  THE  SECRETARY  OF  STATE FOR INDIA.   In my memorandum CP. 96 (37) I  informed my colleagues  of the result of  therecent provincial elections in India under the Act of 1935, which gave the Congressan absolute majority in five Provinces Madras, the United Provinces, the  central provinces, Bihar and Orissa and much the largest single Party (though not a clear majority)  in Bombay.  I have now to report the nature of the negotiations  in theseProvinces which, as announced in the Press here on 27th and 29th  March, have ledto the refusal of office by the person approached by the Governor in each  of thesesix Provinces as the leading Congress representative.   2. The decision  to accept office subject to conditions was arrived at by  theAll-India  Congress Committee at a meeting held at Delhi on 18th March, whichaccepted with  some modifications (commonly regarded as a victory for the RightWing) a  resolution  proposed  for  acceptance of  the  All-India Committee by  the&quot;Working Committee &quot; of the Congress (the  &quot; Inner Cabinet &quot; of the organisation).The  relevant passage in the resolution, which was accepted by a somewhat narrowmargin after a  vote,  was in the following terms :       &quot; On the pending question of acceptance  of office, the  All-India Congress     Committee authorises and permits acceptance of offices in the Provinces where     Congress commands a majority in the Legislature, provided  that  Ministerships     shall  not be accepted unless the Leader of the Congress Party in the Legislature     is satisfied and able to state publicly that the Governor will not use his special     powers of interference or set aside the  advice  of Ministers in regard  to their     constitutional activities.&quot;   3. The general attitude of  Congress,  at  all events as expressed by its headJawaharlal Nehru, since the passage of the Act and even during the elections, hadbeen indicated  as being refusal&apos;to  have  anything to do with  the Act and con-sequeutly  to accept office under it.   But for some weeks past  it has been apparent that  there has  been a  cleavage of  opinion  on this  matter between the  CentralCaucus  and the  provincial  representatives;  and  this cleavage became morepronounced when the  elections  had  produced  Congress  majorities  in  severalProvinces.  All the  indications  then were that  the  provincial leaders who, and whose followers, had made a number of electoral promises, were anxious to assumeoffice.   4. The Congress  resolution, it will be noted, had the appearance at all  events of leaving it to  the judgment of each prospective Chief Minister to decide for himselfwhether he regarded the  assurances he was able  to obtain from the Governor as satisfactory.  On  this interpretation it was  anticipated  by most of the Governors,by the Viceroy, apparently by the provincial  leaders, and by  the Press throughout India that a Congress Chief Minister in each Province would find  himself in aposition to assume office, assisted  perhaps by some general statement on  the partof the Governor.   5. Meanwhile,  the Viceroy and I had decided that it would  be quite impossiblefor any Governor  to give any undertaking which would amount to a promise  notto exercise the special  powers  vested  in  him  by  the Act  and  reinforced  by paragraph VIII  of  the  Governors&apos; Instruments  of  Instructions,  though  it was entirely agreed between us that every Governor could, and indeed  should, give thefullest promises  of  help,  syrapatlry and  co-operation to any Congress  Ministryaccepting office.   6. The Governors  of  the  six  &quot; Congress&quot;  Provinces  accordingly  openednegotiations with  their prospective Chief Ministers, during the course of which thelatter, quite clearly  acting  on instructions from the Caucus, and equally clearly inmost cases against their personal inclinations, inflated as  the only  condition uponwhich  they could form Ministries that the Governor  must give them an assurancewhich they might  make public &quot; that in regard to the constitutional  activities of his ministers  His Excellency will not use his  special powers of interference or set aside     - 5983   85  3.37
the advice of my Cabinet.&quot;  Incidentally it may  be  mentioned  that the MadrapCongress representative had endeavoured as an alternative to secure the agreementof the Governor- and has given  publicity to the fact to an understanding that&quot; even while safeguards remained intact as regards possible interference  from theSecretary of State  and the  Viceroy, we should  have a  gentleman&apos;s agreementbetween His Excellency and me that his own discretionary powers of interferenceas  Provincial Governor should not be put in motion.&quot;   The Governors of the sixProvinces, therefore, after the fullest consultation stage by stage with the viceroy and myself,  have necessarily informed  the  Congress representative whom each ofthem  had  invited  to form a  Ministry, that they cannot agree  to the conditionproposed  and negotiations  have thus come  to an end.  In  some  Provinces theCongress leader has published statements in which  he has attempted  to  arguethe reasonableness of his demands and the unreasonableness  of rejecting  them.The reasonableness or otherwise of the  demands  can be judged by Mr.  Gandhi&apos;sstatement (in the  course of the interview published in the Press on 30th March inwhich he claimed authorship of the formula) that the policy of the Congress was notto secure an amendment of the Constitution  but an absolute ending of it.    7. In all six Provinces  the Governors  explained  in  Press  Communiques thecourse of their  negotiations with  the several Congress representatives, and  havenow asked a leader  of  minority parties to form a Ministry.  At  the  moment my information  is that such Ministries have definitely been formed or  are in process offormation in Madras (six members), the  Central Provinces (four members), Orissa(five members) and Bombay (four members), and that an invitation to form such aMinistry has been accepted also in the  United Provinces.   The  one Province as towhich I have no definite information as to the  result of the invitation given by theGovernor is Bihar.   Obviously, however, even if such Ministries are  formed in allsix Provinces this can only be a temporary expedient.    In the remaining Provinces, of course Bengal, the Punjab, Sind, Assam andthe North-West  Frontier Province Ministries have been  formed  in the  ordinary way, either from the  majority party or from  a coalition of parties, which should beable to command support in the  Legislature and are ready to assume  office on1st April.    8. The  Act cannot  be worked in  any  Province (otherwise than temporarily)on  any  other  basis  than,that of a Governor advised by a Council  of Ministers whohave the working support of a majority in the Legislature.   It contains provisions(section 93)  enabling the Governor if he &quot;is satisfied that a situation has arisen inwThich the government of the Province  cannot be carried on in accordance with theprovisions of this  Act&quot; to assume to &quot;himself by  Proclamation  all or any pf thepowers conferred by  the Act, whether upon, the Executive or the Legislature.   ,for reasons  with which I am sure my colleagues will agree  the Viceroy and I have beenfrom  the start of these recent discussions most anxious to  avoid  recourse to thissection  until it  is clear that no other course is available.   On the other hand, theCongress Presidents desire is clearly to make recoarse  to  section  93  inevitable atthe outset.    9. By temporary  provisions made by Order in  Council  to facilitate the carry-over from the old to the new regime, the Governors were  enabled  themselves toauthorise the appropriations required  for-the first six months, and  to keep existingtaxation in  force for twelve months.  But the question at once arises whether, inany Province where  a minority Cabinet is found willing to co-operate by acceptingoffice in overcoming the deadlock created by the Congress, such Ministries shouldbe called upon to face the Provincial Legislature without delay.   The Act requires that: the Legislature  shall be summoned for  its  first  meeting  within six months from the 1st April.   To car^ on under the Act, therefore, the Legislature in eachProvince would  have to meet  at  the latest early in September, both in order:tocomply  with the requirement of the Act just mentioned and also for  the  purposeof  voting the appropriations required  after  the  expiry of  the first  six  months.Six months is, therefore, the extreme limit up to which in  any Province where theParty which could count on support in the  Legislature  refuses  to  accept  office government under the Act could be carried on without  recourse to  section 93.    10. I will keep my colleagues informed of any important developments.    INDIA OFFICE,           31st  March 1937.                                                                          Z.
