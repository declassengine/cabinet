 (THIS DOCUI-IBMT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)Secret                                                        Copy No.     ICP. 136(37)                          CABINET.            INCREASING TEE PRODUCTIVIT1 OF THE SOIL.,        Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for Scotland,     I have &quot;been asked by the Chancellor to el.aho.rate the surest ion made onpage 2 of C.P.125(57) that failing a general scheme, a separate allocation to scotland of funds to be applied to an arable p^iLicy appropriate to herconditions, be made.     This would be done by the setting up, in the proposed legislation, of aCereals (Scotland) Fund which would replace the Wheat Fund in Scotland.   Intothis Fund would be paid a proportion of the revenues of the Wheat Fund on theGoschen &quot;basis,since this Fund is in fact raised on a bread levy.     Payments out from the Cereals Fund would &quot;be made according to a schemeto be drawn up after discussion with Scottish agriculturists.   The principlesof the payments would &quot;be that payments for cereals would in fact &quot;be confined to wheat and oats;  that wheat in all probability would receive a lcwer subsidy in Scotland than in England;  and that payment on oats would be made on anacreage &quot;basis.     There is nothing new in the principle of an acreage basis.   It was thebasis of the Corn Production Act,, which only broke dorm, on the very large sums of money required&quot;-.   It was the basis of the Conservative agricultural programme in the Election of 1923 when industrial protection was first mooted.   Inaddition it was decided by an interdepartmental Committee representing Board cfTrade, Dominions Office, Agricultural Departments and Treasury, in 1956 that the only practical basis of payment for oats is that of acreage&apos; .     The object would be to secure that the Scottish cereal crop on existing acre- ages would not fall to levels far below the cost of production as it has done in. some recent years.   It is believed that this would lead to a maintenance and possibly to an increase of the land at present under plough, &quot;but also, and this is much more important to the more frequent turnover of grass land and the improve- ment of its productivity.                                                                      The/
          The acreage subsidy which has been considered in recentexaminations has been of the order of 15/-* per acre s 3/- per quarter.No payments would be made when the price of oats was above /24/^/ per quarter, the surplus, if any. being allowed to accumulate against yearsof acute depression since, as will be seen, the moneys available are lessthan would be required to make a scheme which would be fully satisfactory in years such as some which have just passed.          The csat acreage in Scotland is 830,000 acres and therefore thecost of such a scheme for oats would he  622,000 per annum.          The wheat Fund has produced on an average in the years 1932-36inclusive approximately  6 mils, per annum.  The equivalent on the &quot;Goschen&quot;basis is  750,000.          Payments out already made in respect of wheat in Scotland, however,would have to be deducted from the sum available for oats.  These come, overthe same period, to an average of  350,000 per annum.  It will thus be seenthat the figure available for an acreage subsidy on oats would have been about10/- per acre if the subsidy on wheat in Scotland were retained at its 1932-6average and proportionately more if this were reduced.          The proposals in CP. 117(37) are for the purpose amongst others of raising the actual &quot;standard price&quot; of wheat (about 39/- in 1934-5, the lowestyear) to the &quot;notional&quot; standard price of 45/- i.e. a rise of 4/- to 5/- per quarter.  I am prepared to contemplate a standard price in Scotland below45/-.  This should give further funds for the Scottish pool.  This would increase the acreage subsidy though the figure would still be much below what has been previously contemplated.          I would therefore propose an allocation of approximately  150,000from Treasury funds on the understanding that no further increase in sugar-beet acreage was to be allowed in Scotland.  This would have given in all a                                                                 subsidy/
subsidy of 15/- per acre over 1932-36.          The grievance that assistance was being given to arablecultivations for which all might theoretically qualify but which inpractice proved inapplicable to Scotland would thus be removed.          I believe that this would be regarded as a fair settlementof this very long-standing dispute.                                                  I.S.E.Scottish Office,      Whitehall, S.1 .1.     5th May, 1937.
