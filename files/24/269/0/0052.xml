  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJEST Y&apos;S  GOVERNMENT) .C R E T . 147(37) .                                                COPY NO .                        CABINET.                   RATING AND VALUATION BILL.              Memorandum by the Minister of Health.           I  desire the authority of the Cabinet for the preparation of a Bill  of one,or  at most two,clauses to continue for a further quinquennium outside London the existing scales of deduction from gross values in calculating rateable values.   The matter is urgent, since the  existing temporary provisions contained in the Rating and Valuation  Act, 1932,  will, if not  extended, cease to operate in some areas on 1st April,  1938, when new valuation lists are due to come into  force .   These  lists will have to be substantially completed before the end of the calendar year.   In default of amending legislation  the scales originally  enacted in the Rating and Valuation Act,  1925, would automatically be  revived, with a resultant general increase in  the rate burden on the occupants of working-class houses.           The Bill was included in category B(i) in the legislative programme  for the session, Committee of Home Affairs 8(36).           As noted in the conclusions of the Committee of Home Affairs, it  was then comtemplated  that it might be possible to deal with the matter in a more comprehensive measure designed, inter alia, to assimilate the London and provincial valuation law.   For this reason the preparation of the Bill has been postponed until the latest possible moment in order to give the London rating authorities a full opportunity of submitting their proposals for the larger Bill. They have  not, however, done so and it is, therefore, proposed to limit the  present measure to the essential provision continuing the present scales of deduction for a  further limited period outside London.    The present London scale will,.in any event, continue in operation  during the  life .of the present Valuation Lists, i.e. until                             1.
                                                              d id1941,  and the question  of  the  future  scale  is, therefore,..noturgent.          These  proposals  have the  approval of the  Central  ValuationCommittee, who can,  in  this matter, he  regarded  as  voicing  the viewsof provincial rating authorities.   It  is not anticipated that any objection will be raised by the London  authorities  to  the Bill beinglimited  to the provinces .                                        K.W.                                            May  28th,  1937.
