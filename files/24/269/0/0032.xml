                    Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1937.SECRET.                                                        Copy *No.CP. 127 (37).CABINET.PALESTINE.                            PRESENT SITUATION.           Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    I CIRCULATE for the information of my colleagues the most recent letterI have  received from General Sir  Arthur Wauchope regarding - the  presentsituation in Palestine.                                               (Initialled)       W.  O. G.                                                *    Colonial Office, Downing Street.            April ZQ, 1937!APPENDIX.    Letter from the High Commissioner for Palestine to the Secretary of                           State for the Colonies.                                           Government House,My dear Ormsby Gore,                           Jerusalem, April 27, 1937.    I WAS very glad you were able to speak as you did in the House on  the21st April on the situation in Galilee.  It will enhearfen our police and discourageundue pessimism among the Jews.    I  think  the measures we have  taken,  combined with  the presence and activities of Mr. Andrews  in Nazareth,  are  going  far  to restore a feeling ofconfidence in Galilee.   The further  activities  of the.Police rendered possible bythe Army undertaking patrol work (exactly as  is suggested in the Army pamphlet&quot;Imperial Policing&quot;), and  the work  now  being  done by  the  Trans-JordanFrontier Force which  I was able definitely to order thanks to your  despatchof the  15th March, are also doing  much to reduce  crime,, and the employmentof Jewish  supernumerary police to restore confidence.    Whether this reduction of crime will be continuous it is hard to say, when so large a number of landless Arabs are near the border line of starvation as thereare today,  but  we certainly  are in a much stronger  position to meet anyrecrudescence  of crime now than a month ago.  The detachment of  T. J.F.F.are doing excellent work and General Dill is of course now very pleased that theyshould  be proving their worth.    A  collective fine has been imposed on the Arabs  of  Safad and one or two other places.   This form of punishment works out  well  where the bulk of  theinhabitants are clearly concerned in unlawful action,  but not where an individualcriminal may or may not have sought refuge in that particular village.

    The situation both in Safad  and Beisan  is greatly improving  and much needed too.    We  have also succeeded in  reducing  open intimidation  connected  withboycotting to a minimum, but no one can compel the people of one class to buy the produce of another even if it were desirable to use force to do so.    In  a letter to Mills, the Agency admit  that  some 5,000 fewer Jews arenow employed in the building trade  than in 1935;  but as Jews now prefer to buy vegetables, &amp;c. grown by Jews rather than by Arabs, Jewish agricultural workers and  market gardeners have increased  from 5,000 to  10,000  during thelast year.    There is a big discrepancy between-the 11,000 labourers asked  for by the agency, and  the 620 which I am prepared to  grant plus 150  tc Mills&apos;s Depart-ment.  But I  am sure Mills is generally right when he says their figures are basedon hopes, his on facts.    Part of  the difference is accounted for by the  fact that we allow 3,000 forthe labour pool, while the Agency make no provision for  the absorption of Jewishunemployment.  Nor do we agree as to  the needs  of the citrus  industry.   TheJewish  Farmers&apos; Federation an  important  group say further expansion, or indeed any reasonable profit, is impossible so long  as  England maintains thepresent customs duty  or  unless the  standard of living of  Jewish  workers  is reduced to the level of the Arab, and therefore do not advocate expansion.    The bulk of citrus growers have heavy mortgages on their land, which become a heavy burden when the market price constantly falls.  A significant  fact is alsothat 5,500 Jewish capitalists entered in 1935,  and only  3,000 in 1936.    It is generally feared that the difficulties of export not  only of citrus but of manufactured goods will continue to increase.  Customs barriers is  one reason;high price of Jewish labour another.  As regards citrus, the Jews claim that theBritish Government gained nearly  500,000 on customs  duties this season.  they say there is danger of many groves being put up for sale this  year on account ofinability to pay interest on mortgages.  Many of our factories have been started on borrowed  capital, and  high interest charges add to cost of the manufacturedarticle.  There has, however, been no flight of capital, but there are few newinvestments,  and expansion in the, building trade has at present ceased.     The prospects of the harvest  are much brighter since the fall of the  latterrains 10 days ago,  and  this is a factor which will weaken one cause  for furtherdisorders next summer.     From very different standpoints, Arab and Jew are severely critical of thesuggestion to partition Palestine, the  reason being, of course, that each want, and hope somehow to get, not half but the whole cake.     I should have  recommended long ago some form of  division had  I been ableto suggest a  dividing line acceptable to  Arab and  Jew. At the moment, beforethe principles of any such proposal are known and  before any boundary line hasbeen suggested, no one has a good word to say for the suggestion, except Abdullah,and I fear his motives are not entirely disinterested.     If a division of the country is decided on, I feel the question of minorities is most serious.     The idea that &quot; hostages &quot; in one area would secure the safety of the hostagesin another is, in my opinion, dangerous and wholly  false.  There are in Palestinea number of lawless people, who have been in the past  and will be in the futureready to commit acts of violence quite regardless of what might happen to people in  another area.   Such crimes would  be suppressed by various means;  thesesuppressions would lead to reprisals and to riots on an  ever-growing  scale, whenit would become impossible for England to stand aside.  Consequently, it seems  tome if we pretend now that the Jewish and Arab States can be left to settle theirown inter-racial quarrels, we shall only increase our liabilities later.     The self-evident danger of a very large  Arab minority, perhaps equal  to half of the Jewish population in the proposed Jewish  State, is not  diminishedby being ignored, it is increased.     The Mufti, since his visit to Ibn Saud, has been very-quiet, and the HigherArab  Committee  almost  dead except  for  internal squabbles.  Recently,  the National Committee of Nazareth sent a letter to the  National Committee of Nablus reproaching them for their quiescent policy compared to the activities in Galilee during the last few months.  The Nablus Committee wrote back bluntly that they  lid not approve of the.action of the Nazareth Committee, criticized  severely the
leader of the Nazareth National Committee and sent copies of their letter to allother local National Committees.   Neither side invoked support from the HigherArab Committee in Jerusalem.    The Nebi Musa festivals are passing off quietly, as we expected they would.The Mufti feared he might be assassinated, and asked for further police measuresto prevent disturbances.  I am never very anxious about the Mufti&apos;s health. Werehe to be shot, Nashashibi would be killed the next day,  and vice versa, so both, Ithink, are fairly safe.                                           Yours very sincerely,                                                 ARTHUR WAUCHOPE.
