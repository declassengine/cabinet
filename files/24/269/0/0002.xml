I desire to bring before my colleagues the present position    of the Marriage Bill.   It will be remembered that the Bill was    introduced by a private Member and was considered by the Cabinet    on the 18th November last (Cabinet Paper 66(36) Conclusion 12)    when it was decided that upon the Second Reading the    Attorney-General on behalf of the Government should adopt an    attitude neither of approbation nor condemnation,  but that if the    Bill were  given a Second Reading a Law Officer should be available    to help the Standing Committee.   The Bill received a Second    Reading by 78 votes to 12 and the Attorney-General and    Solicitor-General were added to the Standing Committee in    accordance with the Cabinet decision.   Considerable amendments to,    and deletions from., the Bill were made in the Standing Committee ,    and in its present form it may be said not only to preserve the    basic structure of our present divorce law in its prohibition of    collusive  divorce and in other important respects, but even in    some cases to strengthen it.   A print of the Bill as amended in    Committee  and a short summary of its contents are circulated    herewith.    2.     The  main features of the Bill as it now stands are that while    grounds for divorce are extended to cover desertion for threatened*ee years,    cruelty and insanity, no petition for divorce can be presented
&apos;   &apos;                                                              11  except after the expiration of five  years from the  date  of the  marriage.    In addition certain new  grounds upon which a marriage  may &quot;be annulled, &quot;based upon the recommendations of  the Royal  Commission of 1912- are introduced into the law.  3.    It is appreciated that the provision &quot;barring  a petition for  divorce for a period of five years from the marriage may provoke  some hostility, on the ground that a rigid &quot;bar of this kind in  gross cases may work intolerable hardship.    It would seem that  this criticism of the provision is not unjustified  and it may be  that the House will desire to meet it, either by shortening the  period, say, to three years, or by giving the Court a discretion  to disregard the bar in cases of grave hardship or  where the  divorce is sought on grounds involving certain criminal offences.  4,    There is one other matter which, although it  was accepted  by the Committee without amendment,  may be the subject of  controversy in later stages of the Bill in the House of Commons  or in the House of Lords, and that is, the provision which  relieves a clergyman of the Church of England from any obligation  to marry divorced persons or to permit any other minister to  perform such a marriage in his church or chapel.  5.    Certain features open to objection have been eliminated  from the Bill, viz. clauses giving divorce jurisdiction to  Courts of Summary Jurisdiction and the provision abolishing the  decree nisi.   New clauses have, however, been added which will,  it is thought, be of considerable assistance to the Court in  administering the divorce law, not only as extended by this Bill,  but as it stands at present.   In particular Clause 4 gives the  Court additional powers with the object of preventing collusive  suits.   Under the law as it stands  the Court is bound to grant  a divorce unless it is satisfied that there is collusion,
whereas  index*  the  new clause  the  onus  is changed and the Court is bound  to grant a deci*ee  only  if it  is  satisfied that the petitionis not presented or  prosecuted in collusion.    This Clause,  aswell as  other  machinex*y  clauses which  have  been added to the Bill,was considex*ed by  the  Law Officers  and the  Governments advisers,who also had the benefit of consultation with the Pi*esident  of theDivoi^e  Division.    The  President is satisfied that these clauseswill matex^ially assist in the administration of the woi*k of  hisDivision,6,     The smallness  of the vote against the Bill on Second Readingindicates, I think,  some change in  public opinion, and it may bethat its  passage into  law will remove  divorce law refoim fx*om thepolitical ai&apos;ena for  some time to  come.    When the Report stage of the Bill is taken the House will no doubt expect theGovex&apos;nment to .give some  indication  of  theii&quot; attitude towax*ds it,and in ox*der that  instructions may  be  given to the government spokesman on the Report  stage, I  have  thought it right to bringthe mattei&apos; before my colleagues.7.     The Promoters  have secux*ed  Friday,  April 16th, for theReport Stage of the  Bill as First Order,  and it is possible,though not perhaps very  likely, that they may get a fui*theroppox*tunity out of Pi&apos;ivate Members&apos; time  in the following week.The Chief Whip  thinks that Private  Membex-s&apos;  time may be sufficientto dispose of  the Bill.    The  Government  ax-e  likely to be askedbefore the report^t Stage  has begun what  will be their attitude tothe Bill, and  this is the main question which I wish to bi*ingbefore the Cabinet,8.     It seems  to me that  our attitude  should be that we  hope thatthe Private Members&apos;  time  available to  the  Promoters will be
sufficient fox1 the remaining stages of the Bill,  in which  case no special action of the Government will he necessary.   We shouldawait the exhaustion of Px*ivate Members&apos; Fridays  before*e offeringany Govexjnment facilities.   I imagine that we should not  bepi&apos;prepared in any case to &quot;star&quot; the Bill and take  it over,  but,on the other hand, I feel strongly that the Govex*nment should notlet the Bill lapse merely fox* want of a little more time if thatis all that is needed to get it threatened&quot;ough by a substantial majorityof the House.   Would it not, therefoi*e, be possible if a  littlemoi&apos;e time is needed for the Govei&apos;nment to consider whether thex*ewas any means of supplying it, as we should prefer that themeasure, now that it has got so far, is dealt with one way orthe other by a free vote of the House?   This, however, need  notbe announced in advance.   (I may remind the Cabinet that  in  1907the Deceased Wife&apos;s Sister1 s Bill, which was also a px*ivatemeasure, was dealt with in its concluding stages  by theGovei&apos;nment securing the suspension of the 12 o&apos; clock Rule  andthen handing the time ovex* to the Promoters, with the result  thatthe Bill was passed by 6 o&apos; clock next moi*ning).

Summary of Marriage Bill as amended           in Committee     Ql_au.ee 1 - This clause provides that no petition for adivorce shall be presented within five years of the marriage,although the clause does not prohibit the presentation of a petition after the expiration of that period upon groundsarising during the period.     Clause 2 - This clause amends Section 176 of the SupremeCourt of Judicature (Consolidation) Act, 1925, so as to extend the grounds of divorce (which at present are adultery andcertain criminal offences) to desertion for a period of threeyears immediately preceding the petition, cruelty, andincurable insanity necessitating continuous care and treatment as defined in Clause 3 for a period of at least five years immediately preceding the petition.   This clause does not goso far as the majority report of the Royal Commission of 1912,which in addition to the grounds above-mentioned, recommendeddrunkenness and imprisonment under a commuted death sentenceas grounds for divorce.     Clause 3. - This clause defines the degree of insanitynecessary to found a petition for divorce which in effect isthat the insane person must have been detained aftercertification as a lunatic in an institution, or must be receiving treatment as a voluntary patient after a period of detention and certification.     Clause^4 - This clause amends Section 178 of the Principal&apos;Act by strengthening the position of the Court as regardswithholding a decree on the ground that the petitioner has been guilty of collusion, connivance or conduct conducing.   Underthe law as it stands to-day the Court is bound to grant a decreeif adultery is proved unless it is positively satisfied that
collusion or connivance exists.   Under &quot;this clause the onusof proving the absence of collusion &amp;c. is shifted and theCourt may withhold a decree where it is not satisfied thatthere has not been collusion &amp;c.      Clause 5 - This clause amends Section 185 of thePrincipal Act.   It provides that a petition for judicialseparation may be presented on any grounds on which a petitionfor divorce might be presented, and that it shall be subjectto the same defences.   The present grounds upon which a decreeof judicial separation may be granted are adultery, cruelty,desertion for two years, and failure to obey a restitutiondecree.   The change effected in the law by the clause istherefore that desertion must have existed for three insteadof two years, and failure to obey a restitution decree will nolonger be a ground for a decree of judicial separation.   Theclause further provides that any person to whom there has beengranted a decree of judicial separation or a non-cohabitationorder made under the Summary Jurisdiction (Separation andMaintenance) Acts 1895 to 1925 may, if the decree or order hasbeen continuously&apos; in force for three years and the parties havenot during that period cohabited, present a Petition fordivorce without alleging any further grounds.   This clause asit stands is not entirely satisfactory and some amendment toit may be necessary.      Clause 6 - This clause introduces the following newgrounds for declaring a marriage to be null and voids-      (1) that the respondent has wilfully refused to      consummate the marriage.      (2) that either party was at the time of the marriage      of unsound mind, or was at that time, or has been within
     12 months thereof, placed in an institution or under     guardianship under the Mental Deficiency Act, 1913, or     was at the time of the marriage subject to fits of     insanity or epilepsy.     (3) that the respondent was at the time of the marriage     suffering from a venereal disease,     (4) that the respondent was at the time of the marriage     pregnant by some person other than the petitioner,     As regards the last three grounds the Court must besatisfied, that the petitioner was at the time of the marriageignorant of the facts alleged 5  that proceedings have been instituted within a year from the date of the marriage, andthat the marriage has not been consummated since the factscomplained of came to the petitioners knowledge.   Thisclause follows a recommendation of the Royal Commission.      Clause 7 - Tuis clause enables a married person toobtain a decree for the presumption of the death of his orher spouse on the grounds that for a period of seven yearshe or she has been continuously absent, and has not within thatperiod been known to be living.   This clause follows a recommendation of the Royal Commission.     Clause 8 - This clause enables the respondent, against whom a decree nisi for divorce has been made, to apply to theCourt to have the decree made absolute when the petitioner,having obtained a decree nisi, fails to apply to ha-e it madeabsolute within three months of the date when it is possibleso to do.   The Court on such an application may make thedecree absolute, dismiss the petition, or make such otherorder as it thinks fit.     Clause 9 - This clause deals with certain proceduralmatters and makes the necessary adaptations in the existing
procedure to meet the amendments in the substantive law ofdivorce contemplated by the Bill.   In the first place itenables application to be made with regard to alimony,maintenance and alteration of settlements before the decreenisi.     Under the law as it stands no such application cenbe made until after the decree nisi has been pronounced, rndit is thought, both by the President of the Divorce division and those practising in that Court, that it is desirable thatthese subsidiary matters should be before the Court when the substantive petition for divorce is being heard.   The clausealso provides that a wife who obtains a divorce on the ground of her husband&apos;s insanity may be ordered to contribute to hismaintenance if she has separate estate.   The existing lawalready enables the Court to order a husband vho obtains adivorce on the ground of his wife&apos;s insanity to contribute to-her support.     Clause 10 -  This clause enables a Court of summary jurisdiction to order that husband or wife need no longercohabit with a wife or husband guilty of adultery.      Clause 11 - This clause provides that no clergyman ofthe Church of England should be compelled to marry any person who has obtained a divorce and whose former spouse is livinr,or to permit the use of his church or chapel for such aceremony.   Under the law as it stands to-day, while noclergyman of the Church of England can be compelled to marrya divorced person who was the guilty party in the divorceproceedings, he is bound to permit some other minister to use his church or chapel for the purpose.      Clause 12 - This clause provides that where a wife whosehusband is domiciled in England is deserted by him or where heis deported as an undesirable alien, she shall not lose her
right to bring a petition for divorce in England by reason ofthe fact that the husband has since his desertion ordeportation acquired another domicile..  The basis of divorcejurisdiction in this country is the domicile of the parties,and but for this clause the domicile of the wife would bethat of the husband.   There have been many cases of hardshipwhere a wife who has been deserted by her husband proceedingabroad and acquiring another domicile, has been unable toobtain any relief in the Courts of this country.   Thisclause follows a recommendation of the Royal Commission of1912.
