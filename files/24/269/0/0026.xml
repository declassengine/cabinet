SECRET.                                                        Copy No.CP. 121 (37).CABINET.NATIVE POLICY IN  THE  UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.    Memorandum circulated, by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.    I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a copy of a despatch from the High Com-missioner in the Union of  South Africa for His Majesty&apos;s Government in  theUnited Kingdom dealing with the views of Mr. Pirow, the Union  Minister.of railways and Harbours and of Defence, on the subject of the relationship of whiteand black in Africa.  A copy of Mr. Pirow&apos;s own summary of. his broadcast, towhich reference is made in the High Commissioner^ despatch, is also annexed.    Mr.  Pirow&apos;s views are of considerable importance, as he is  a  dominantpersonality in South  African politics and likely eventually to become PrimeMinister of the Union.  He is  undoubtedly determined to pursue the policyenunciated  in his broadcast talk, and will no doubt try to enlist support in thatendeavour from the Europeans in all the East African  territories.     -                                  m                             M. M.    Dominions Office, April 23, 1937.  Despatch from the High Commissioner in the Union of South Africa for His               Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.Sir,                                           Cape Town, March 15, 1937.    IN my despatch No. 130 of the 11th March on the subject of the debate in theUnion  House of Assembly, on  Colonel Stallard&apos;s motion protesting against thepublication of an article by Dr. Bodenstein in.,Die Europaische Revue, I informedyou that Colonel. Stallard endeavoured.to link that article with a contribution tothe same South African number of that periodical of ah  article by Mr. Pirow onthe subject of the extent of the Union.&apos;s interest in the Continent of Africa.  Thisparticular side-issue was not taken up by subsequent speakers in the debate, but,whether in consequence of the.debate or not, Mr. Pirow himself has now informedSouth Africa, by means of  a broadcast in Afrikaans from the Cape Town station,o .the views to which his article in the Revue had given expression.    2  I  had occasion to see Mr. Pirow on another matter on the 9th March, the morning on which his broadcast had been fully summarised  and discussed in thepress, and it dame up  in the course of our conversation.  He handed me whathecalled a summary of his talk,  which, he  added, did him more justice than thereports which had  heen published; in the local  newspapers.  A  copy  of thissummary  is enclosed in this&apos; despatch; it will be observed  that  it is dated the28th September,  1936, which suggests that the summary is,  in fact, the original draft of his article for Die Europaische Revue.       [15071]   :                                                   B                  Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1937.
     3.  There is nothing new to us in the attitude displayed by Mr. Pirow; he has always been a reactionary in the  matter of native and coloured policy, and he has always given me the impression that he likes to set up some bogey or other, whether  it  be  the  fear  of  a  yellow   invasion,   the   fear  of  a   black invasion  from the  north,  or  the  fear of  a native and  coloured  rising within  the Union  prompted  by  Communist  propaganda.   But  I do not remember that he has ever, hitherto, spoken his mind so bluntly as on the present occasion; and it looks a little as if the choice of this moment for the propagation of his creed was another step in his campaign against Mr. Hofmeyr and the so- called Liberal school in this country.  I do not mean to suggest that Mr. Hofmeyr desires what Mr. Pirow regards as the only alternative to his own policy, namely, the social and political assimilation of the negro.  Mr. Hofmeyr believes that an increasing measure of  political equality  is possible without  social  assimilation, and that a compromise is  the right course;  his  creed is  fully  discussed in Mr. Antrobus&apos;s despatch No. 339 of the  28th August last.  Mr. Pirow&apos;s broad- cast is in some measure his counterblast to  the speech  by Mr. Hofmeyr, with which that despatch  was  concerned;   and if  that   speech was  typical of Mr. Hofmeyr and I believe that to be the case the views  now enunciated by Mr. Pirow are as  typical of his contrasting personality.   As I have indicated in recent despatches, it  is  becoming increasingly likely that it will be on some issue of native policy that Mr. Hofmeyr and Mr. Pirow will part company.  Moreover, I fear, that, so far at least as the immediate future is concerned, Mr. Pirow will be on the stronger side.    -4.  These considerations arise from a study of what Mr. Pirow has now said over the wireless to the South African public, and there is nothing in what he said to me in the course of our tete-a-tete conversation to make me inclined to modify them.  The subject was introduced when he spoke to me of the importance which he attached to solidarity of policies among the  States and colonies  south of the Sahara.  Discussion of questions of policy with Mr. Pirow is always a stimulating affair, so  I took the opportunity of referring to his  remarks about native policy which he had described as one of the  interests common  to the Union and to its neighbours to the north.  I said that  I could not help feeling that  he had gone rather further than was perhaps expedient.  He had insisted on the conception that the interests  of  white civilisation must be  considered first at all times and under  all circumstances; and he doubtless realised that this  was completely opposed to the British attitude to the subject races and to our announced policy in Kenya and other colonies.  I felt that this utterance  would add to the embarrass- ments which already surrounded the question of the transfer of the Territories.  I told him that the Prime Minister had complained to me that the Secretary of  State had done nothing  to overcome  the  feeling in the  British House of Commons against transfer, and I pointed out that utterances of this kind by a Minister, who was regarded in England as one of the most influential leaders in the Union, would  be particularly unhelpful.    5.  Mr. Pirow was entirely unrepentant.  He said  that  in his  judgment it was of no use mincing these matters.  The Union had not had a clearly defined native policy until the Native Acts of last year became law, but now that they had one, it was better to strip away all pretences and deal with facts as they were.  So far as the Territories were concerned, there were two obstacles to transfer, the reluctance of the natives and the reluctance of British public opinion, especially as represented  in  the British House of  Commons.   From both standpoints, he regarded the Thomas-Hertzog Agreement of 1935 as futile.   He did not believe, and never had believed, that such benefits as  the Union might be able to confer by co-operation would influence the native mind.   Similarly, he did not believe that anything which they could do on these lines would seriously mitigate hostile opinion in the United Kingdom.  To his mind, the  only effective argument wasthe economic one.  If the Union withdrew the present marketing advantages which  the Territories enjoyed and  thus prevented their produce entering the Union, the Territories would have to surrender; and his  opinion was that sooner or later the Union Government ought to make up their minds to that course.  I pointed out that this would be a very  serious step to take, and might lead to aregrettable embitterment of feeling in the  United Kingdom against the Union.  Irecognised that there was substance in what he said  about the difficulty of  modi- fying sentiment both in the Territories  and in England against transfer, but
drastic measures would be a very bad way out of the dilemma, and, in the mean-time, it seemed a pity to enhance the difficulties which already existed.  Mr. Pirowwent a step further and said that when, as a result of his policy, the Union took over the Native Territories, it would, of course, be made clear that the nativescould look forward to no political rights in the Union.  I said I supposed that iftransfer took place, we should stipulate, and I imagined that the Union Governmentwould agree, that the Territories should preserve their existing entities, something like the Native States in India, and would continue to be administered accordingto the principles of indirect rule.   If so,  political  rights in the European sensewould hardly arise.   Mr. Pirow seemed to have a very vague idea of what indirectrule meant,  so  I briefly explained.  I  added that so far as administration was concerned, it seemed to me, if the foregoing were agreed to that no great difficultiesneed arise, except, as we were being candid, that in the process of time the presentBritish staff  would gradually disappear; as the present tendency in  the  SouthAfrican public service was preponderantly Afrikander,  presumably the staffingof the Territories would follow the same lines and that would not be agreeable tothe natives.   Mr. Pirow replied that he thought there would be a reaction  in thepresent tendencies in the Union public service, and that larger numbers of BritishSouth Africans would soon be entering it  again, but he did not give any reasonsfor this belief.     6.  I should add that our talk was, of course, purely informal and not in theleast acrimonious.  Mr. Pirow,  unlike General Hertzog, is very quick to take apoint in conversation and he follows out his argument both rapidly and forcefully.     7.  It now only remains for me to give you some idea of the reception which mr. Pirow&apos;s address has received in the editorial columns of the press.  The CapeTimes and Cape Argus are not  yet prepared finally to abandon the Cape liberaltradition and they  are  both, therefore, inclined to criticism.  The former paystribute to the Union&apos;s policy of pan-African co-operation and considers that most useful work has been done in providing skeleton arrangements for co-ordination in such matters as transport and postal organisation.  It was possible that therewas justification for some extension of  the system to  such vital questions ofcommon interest as  defence.  But  whether Mr.  Pirow was right in believing thatthere was any danger to white civilisation  in Africa from the black man  was another matter.  &quot;There has been no evidence,&quot; the Cape Times says,  &quot;of anysuch danger.&quot;  The only potential dangers which required to be considered so faras  British Africa was  concerned  were those that threatened from  outside thecontinent.  With regard to the  Ministers argument that political equality mustlead to assimilation,  that  was &quot;based on a very large  assumption&quot; which thehistory of the Cape Colony did not justify.  In the Cape, political equality in the sense of the equal franchise had worked well and had not led even vaguely towardsthe disappearance  &quot; of white civilisation.&quot;   It  appeared, however,  that  SouthAfrica, for better or for worse, had adopted the  general policy enunciated andfavoured by  Mr. Pirow.  &quot; But it may at least be hoped,&quot; is the articled piousconclusion, &quot; that, if we can once get  rid of the fear complex which  still seemsto linger in Mr. Pirow&apos;s mind, we  may witness a larger and more liberal attitude to native questions as a whole in this country.&quot;  The Cape Argus article, of whicha copy is enclosed, says very much the same thing, but as usual, with greaterforcefulness.  I entirely agree with Mr. McCauslancVs conclusions.     8.  Die  Suiderstem takes the contrary  and typically Afrikander  view.  Itbelieves that there is only a choice of two things, either assimilation or &apos;&apos; divisioninto two camps with the leadership entrusted for all time to the white population.&quot;The Union, the newspaper continues, had chosen.   But, as Mr. Pirow had pointedout, the choice of the rest of Africa did have a direct effect on the Union, which,as the chief white country  in Africa, must take the lead in the interests of whitecivilisation.  The policy of other African States in regard  to the native problem was, therefore, of great importance  to the Union.  If the countries north of theLimpopo took a different view from the Union, &quot; the white settlements in Africawill be wiped out and swallowed  up and  we, with our odd 2 million whites will find ourselves standing against a black and coloured mass of 40 million. .,  . In orderto  safeguard ourselves  we must be prepared to defend our frontiers from the invasion of hordes from the north.&quot;  It was  sometimes asked what  the  Union       [15071]                                                     B 2
wanted with a defence force : there was  the answer.  Moreover, the country should maintain contact with the whites of the north, whom it would be calledupon to lead should a common policy be followed.  &apos;&apos; As the only country that has worked out a real and practical policy, it is comprehensible that all eyes shouldbe turned towards us.&quot;  The article concludes by congratulating Mr.  Pirow ontackling this knotty problem  of the not far distant future.    9.  Die Burger, which gave a  full resume of Mr. Pirow&apos;s address, has not hitherto offered editorial comment.  I imagine  that it will find the Minister&apos;views as to the correctness of the present native policy of the Union unimpeachable;but that, if the editor deems  it necessary to comment at all, he will, for political reasons, suggest that this is a Pirovian manoeuvre to allow him,  in the event of trouble in the north, to get the Union entangled in it.    10.  Meanwhile,  the  contrast  between  the views of Die Suiderstem, as representing the Afrikaans-speaking people of the&apos; Cape, and the Cape Times andA rgus is illuminating.  It is,  in fact, the same contrast as that between Mr. Pirowand Mr. Hofmeyr.                                  I have,  &amp;c.                                      W. H. CLARK, High Commissioner.The Right Hon. Malcolm MacDonald, M.P.,               &amp;c, &amp;c, &amp;c,             Dominions Office.SUMMARY OF MR. PIROW&apos;S BROADCAST.        How far is the Union interested in the Continent of Africa?    EVEN a casual examination of the map of Africa shows that the bulk ofthe continent is more within the sphere of interest of Europe than of the Union.    If we draw a line across Africa along the southern borders of the Sahara and include as for political reasons we must- the remaining portions of the Sudanand of Abyssinia, we cut the continent very nearly in half.  I do not think eventhe most ambitious South African can visualise a time when our influence will mean very much in the territories to the north of this dividing line.    Next, let us look at the West Coast  as far south as Angola.   without exception, these areas are made up of territories with a climate which will neverencourage the building  up of a permanent  white population.  The West  Coastrepresents a  portion of  Africa  which whatever European Power it may owepolitical allegiance  to belongs,  and always will belong, to the black man.  our interests, if any, will never go beyond such commercial relations as we may be ableto establish in competition with European countries.  That leaves us with africa south of the  Equator, but  without French  Equatorial  Africa in the West andwith the addition of Kenya and Uganda in the East.  In this portion of Africawe have a very definite  interest.  In fact, it is no exaggeration to say that it isas vital for the future of these territories as it is  for us that we should work inthe closest possible harmony  and with the  fullest possible co-operation.  If webear in mind that, although this  portion  of Africa  contains many  areas  asunhealthy as  the West  Coast, yet the bulk of the territories it comprises can maintain a large white population, the affinities with the Union, the largest whiteState in Africa, at once become apparent. .  There is as  yet not much  intercoursebetween the Union  and these potential white areas.  In fact, up to  a short whileago London and Cape Town were closer together than Pretoria and Salisbury,the capital of our  nearest neighbour.   That  is all changing  now, almost from day to day, and the time is not so far distant when these territories will be linked up by daily Air Services both up and down Africa.  Although this will also bringEurope nearer to  this portion of Africa,  in the first  place  it will  lead  to an
 adequate appreciation by the territories concerned of their mutual interests, in fact, of their almost complete interdependence.  Of the problems which we, that is, the  Union and our  neighbours  to the North, have in common, the  most important, as well as the most urgent, is the Native Question.  Unless the white man can put the relationship between himself and the negrO on such a footing that the requirements of European civilisation are and remain paramount, the idea of  a large permanent white population in Southern Africa is an illusion.     As regards the relationship of black and white in Africa,  there are roughly two schools of thought.  There is the policy of assimilation, which,  ultimately at any rate, concedes to the negro full political,  economic and social equality with the European.  Then there is the policy of differentiation which concedes to the black man the unqualified right under our guardianship to develop along his own lines to  the fullest extent of which he is capable and which, in fact, places on the white man the obligation to assist the native in such development, but which definitely once and for all time denies the negro social and political equality with the European.     The latter doctrine is the accepted policy of the Union.  It is,  in my opinion, the policy  which ultimately,. with  or without modification,  will  be accepted by all  our northern neighbours.  Even to-day the  permanent  white population of these territories with very few  exceptions repudiates all ideas of equality between black and white.  It is true that  some  of  the  Governments concerned, in theory at any rate, favour the policy of assimilation, but ultimately not Governments and officials,  but the men and women who  have made their permanent home on African soil, will shape its native policy.   To them, whose whole future and the future of whose children lie here and not overseas,  it is a matter beyond all argument and dispute that political equality for the native inevitably leads to social equality, and that the latter means one thing and one thing only, viz., the end of the white race.     If the native question is the most vital of the common problems  we  have to face,  next in importance come matters of defence.   Although the possibility of any of  these territories  being  attacked by an enemy from outside is remote, it does not need much imagination to visualise that if such an attack were made by say some Asiatic Power, it  would so  endanger the common ideal of white civilisation that the rest of the  territories would have to intervene.     There is the further fact that the while communities South of the Sahara are and probably always  will be white islands  in a vast black sea  and  that we could not as a matter of principle allow any one of these islands to be engulfed by such black sea.     The little we in the Union have seen of the effect of Communist propaganda on the negro, brings  the danger of  a concerted attack on the white minority within the realm of practical politics of the future, even if it is not the immediate future.     These dangerous possibilities  both as regards   internal  and  as  regards external difficulties will tend to bring us  closer together in matters of defence irrespective of what may be going on  in Europe and  notwithstanding  the fact that all the territories concerned with the exception of the Union and Southern Rhodesia are  colonies of European  Powers.    Whilst matters of native policy and of defence occupy the first rank in our list of common problems, there are others only slightly less  important.    Let  me  mention  the  question  of  communications,  especially  problems of transportation by land, air and  water.   Only the other day a Southern  African Transport Conference was held in Johannesburg, when all the States I have been referring to were fully represented and agreed on measures of collaboration which, in course of time, will establish  a spirit  of cordiality going  far beyond  mere neighbourliness.    Before we met about  matters  of transportation,  there had already been conferences on questions of public health, of locusts and other common agricultural pests, and of common postal and telegraphic facilities.    In fact, as more contacts are made we are, all of us, beginning to appreciate the inescapable fact that not only in matters  affecting our daily lives  and  theeconomic development of our respective territories, but beyond  that in our very existence as white communities, we are interdependent to an extent that  the European countries to whom we  owe allegiance or with whom we are otherwise politically  associated may not appreciate  for  many a day.
    To come then to the question which acts as a heading to this article.  Howfar is the Union interested in the Continent of Africa?  The reply is as follows :The Union is not interested in the African Continent to  a greater extent than.roughly, south of the Equator, including: as previously stated Kenya and Uganda.but excluding French Equatorial Africa.    . .  . .    In; these territories, we are  strongly,  almost vitally interested,  because weare the only white  State in Africa, and  because  these areas or  most of them will,; in time, carry a  large white population of their own.   In  Europe whiteStates may be able to  afford fighting  each other :  in Africa,  the  whites will disappear with calamitous rapidity unless they stand together.   The responsibility which rests on the Union in this connection is a.grave one, but one which we are capable of bearing and willing to accept,.Ministry of Defence,&apos;&quot;. *  Pretoria,  September 28, 1936.
