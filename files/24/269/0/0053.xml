                           OFFICES OF THE CABINET.                            2 , Whitehall Gardens , S .V7.1                                   June    193 7.My dear Earl Marshal,     The Prime Minister has asked me to write to youabout the seating of Members of the Cabinet in westminster Abbey at the Coronation, to which his attention was called at a recent Meeting of the Cabinet     It seems that, apart from those members of theCabinet who took part in the ceremony or had seatsamong the Peers, Cabinet Ministers were for the mostpart allotted seats among members of the House ofCommons.  They were not grouped together but werescattered to a considerable extent, without any recogni-tion of their status as members of the Cabinet.     The Cabinet fully realise the difficulties whichmust have been encountered in accommodating such largenumbers, and they assume that the arrangements were probably based to a considerable extent upon precedent.No doubt, also, under the traditional arrangementsprominence was given to the Peerage and to CourtOfficials.  It is appreciated also that provision hadto be made for large numbers of distinguished foreignrepresentaiives .     The general view of the Cabinet, however, is thatit would be more in accordance with modern usage if,on any future occasion of the kind, Cabinet ministers and their wives could, as fa.r as possible, be groupedtogether.  They feel also that, in view of the distinctive national character of the Coronation,it. would be more appropriate that they should occupya more prominent position than was found possible onMay 12th.     The Prime Minister asks me to add that the objectof this letter is not to criticise the arrangements
made on that date,  but  to request  that  the  views  ofthe Cabinet may be  placed on record in  such form  asto ensure that, on any  future occasion,  they may  bebrought to the notice of those on  whom  responsibilityfor the seating arrangements falls.
