The Cabinet at their meeting held on 3rd February, 1937 (Cabinet 5 (37) :Conclusion 14), agreed :      (a) That with a view to an early decision the  Secretary of State for War should           circulate as soon as possible an estimate of the cost of his proposals based           on  the suggestions of  the  Minister  for Co-ordination  of Defence  in           CP. 46 (37), which may be summed up as follows :            (i) The Regular  Army  and the two Anti-Aircraft  Divisions o  the                  Territorial  Force  must be provided with  the most  complete and                  efficient equipment.           (ii)  The remainder of the Territorial  Force  must be trained in the use                  of the same weapons  as the Regular  Army.           (iii) For  this purpose  they  must be  given  sufficient  equipment  for                  training  purposes which would be  spread evenly over  the whole                  of the twelve divisions.     (b) That in working out their  plan the War Office should also state the dates to           which they were working.     (c) That the time factor  in the  programme  should be further considered by the           Ministers concerned.     2.  The cost of equipping the Air Defence of Great Britain and  the  Regular army has been reviewed and a  summary of the costs appears in Appendix I together with a comparative summary of the costs of the  earlier programme detailed in  D.R.C.  37(November, 1935).   These costs include not only  what has already received approvalbut also certain  proposals which have recently been submitted but have not yet beenapproved, and certain proposals which have not yet  been submitted but are likely tobe essential.   These proposals include the extended  programme for equipment withtanks of the  Regular Army,  and the replacement of  3-inch anti-aircraft guns by *7-inch and 4-5-inch anti-aircraft guns in the Regular Field Force and  ports abroad.     It  will be  observed that this  statement of costs now sub-divides costs into themain headings, Regular. Army, Air Defence of Great Britain, defended ports, industrialmobilization, etc.     A statement is also included in Appendix I showing the ultimate recurrent annual cost  of the additional  personnel required by the revised programme.     3.  The cost of equipping referred to above is for a Regular-Army organized as described  in  OP. 325 (36)  (which  was  originally issued  as  D.P.R. 145).   Thisorganization engaged  the attention of the General Staff throughout the year 1936.  Atthe same time a plan for the  eventual re-organization of the Territorial Army was alsotaken in hand, though hi view of the decision of the Cabinet (Cabinet  10 (36)), this plan was given only secondary consideration.     Various proposals were considered including one  for an Army of  a more highlymechanized nature than that  decided upon for the Regular Army.79H.D.460
     The course of discussions in the  Cabinet  and inthe Sub-Committee on Defence.Policy and Requirements has shown that it is out of the question, in view of the very heavy defence programme to which the Government is already committed, to submit proposals for extensive mechanization  which  would entail  greatly increased expendi-ture on the Territorial Army.   At  the same  time the  Chiefs  of  Staffs have  stated(C.O.S. 550 : paragraph 21) that in their opinion the present would be a most unfortunatemoment to disturb an organization which has valuable traditions and has survived thelean years through which it has passed since the  War.     With the above principles in view, a re-organization has been arrived at whichwill keep the  Territorial Army in line with the  Regular Army with the exception ofits tank  formations and units, whilst at the same  time providing nuclei of the latter fortraining purposes.     Appendix II shows the proposed  re-organization of the Territorial Army.     This reorganization maintains  and modernizes all existing  units, none of whichare abolished ; no additional units have been included  in the proposals, but it  may befound necessary later to make some modifications in peace establishments and to raisecertain new units in cadre form.     4.  In  accordance  with the  above, the  equipment required  for  training thereorganized Territorial  Army (other than the two Anti-Aircraft Divisions) in the useof. the same weapons as the Regular Army has been reviewed.and a statement of thecost of the  provision of such equipment is given in A of Appendix III.     With the manufacturing capacity that is being organized for the equipment of theRegular Army, the bulk of this training equipment, (except  25-pdrs.) could, it  ishoped, be provided by  April, 1940, allowing for  the needs of the Regular Army.     5.  In the above paragraphs and in the attached Appendices the estimates requiredby the Cabinet at their Meeting 5 (37) held  on 3rd February, 1937, have been  given.It is thought, however, that an explanation should  also be given of what the measures,therein proposed, mean in terms of  the readiness. for war  of the Territorial Army orany part of it.     6.  It is axiomatic  that a formation cannot take the field until it is  provided withits full scale of  war equipment, and sufficient  reserves of equipment to maintain it, atthe estimated rates of  wastage, during the period that  must elapse until it  can bemaintained  by post-mobilization manufacture.     The length of this period will depend on the manufacturing capacity in existenceon mobilization, the times required to  manufacture the various articles of equipment,and the  estimated rates of war wastage.     On  the assumption that manufacturing capacity already exists, the times taken to manufacture the various articles of  military equipment vary from a few weeks to eightto  twelve months.  If manufacturing capacity is not available, these periods will  be considerably extended.     The estimated  rates of war wastage of the  various  articles of  armaments andequipment vary greatly, but 10 per cent, a month may be taken as an average figure.     7.  The conclusion to  be drawn  from these  considerations is that, while it isdifficult  to make  more  than  a  rough  estimate of  the  time  required  to  createmanufacturing capacity after the war starts (it would, for obvious reasons, be a quickerprocess under war than under peace conditions), it is fair to say that no formationscould be placed in the field in less than about twelve months unless-     (a)  A considerable part of their war equipment (including a varying  proportion            of reserves), and especially those forms of equipment which take a long            time to manufacture, were held in peace.     (&amp;)  At least a shadow manufacturing capacity to supplement the war equipment            and reserves at (a)  were provided in peace.     8.  The manufacturing capacity now being created is based only on the deficiency programme for the Regular Army and the Air Defence of Great Britain.     The reserves which it is proposed to hold in peace for the Regular Field Force are, those  which, it is estimated, are required for its  maintenance until  that, manufacturing capacity, increased as necessary, can maintain it in  the field.   Moreover, the  manu- facturing capacity at present envisaged cannot be counted  upon generally to do more than that ; it cannot be  regarded  as being  sufficient  in  war  for  equipping  or maintaining the Territorial Army.
                                       s3     9. The decisions of the  Cabinet at  their Meeting 5 (37) held on  3rd February,1937, were that the estimates of the costs of the  proposals of the Secretary of  Statefor War were to be based  on the suggestions of the Minister  lor  Co-ordination  ofDefence in CP. 46 (37).  These suggestions were :          &quot; The remainder of the Territorial  Army must be  trained in the use of the     same weapons as  the Regular  Army.  For this  purpose  they must be given     sufficient equipment for  training purposes, having regard to their position in our     Defence Forces.  The equipment thus  provided  for the Territorial Army would     be spread evenly over  the whole of  the twelve divisions, and in the event of an     emergency it  should be possible to equip fully one or more divisions (according     to the stage which  the programme had reached)  by drawing upon the equipment     of the  Force  as a whole.  In  this way I  should  anticipate that  one or more     divisions could be sent out in reinforcement of the  Regular Army after not more     than four months  from  the  outbreak  of  war.   Meanwhile the supply capacity     which will have  been  already planned would be brought into production and  a     succession of reinforcements become available up  to the total war strength of the     Territorial Army.&quot;     10.  In accordance with the above, a statement is attached as Appendix IV which shows in its last column the number of divisions that  can be equipped  for war out ofthe total of the training equipment.  The remaining  columns of this statement show the process by which the results in the last column have been  reached.     It  must  be remembered,  however, that  the despatch of even  two  divisionsnecessitates the despatch at the same time  of  a  number of Corps Troops, i.e., unitsoutside divisional formations  which are required for the efficient, use of the divisions inthe field.     It will  be seen that the number of infantry tanks available would be insufficient toprovide the war equipment and reserves  needed for one  tank battalion (i.e., the quota for one  division),  and  that  in  order to send  two divisions overseas the remainingdivisions  would be  to  a large  extent,  and in some items  entirely, denuded of the equipment essential to their training at a time when not only is  their personnel being very  largely increased  by post-mobilization recruitment, but when in addition  their training  must be  carried out  on  an intensive programme.   Moreover,  the  scale oftraining  equipment proposed  does  not provide  for   the  reserves of ammunitionwhich must be held in peace  for any portion of the Territorial Army, whose despatchoverseas  within four months of the outbreak of war is contemplated.     This, in the opinion of the Army  Council,  is not  a  proposition  which can  beaccepted as our aim in planning the Territorial  Army for use in  war, though it is one that may be forced upon us should we be so unfortunate as to be involved in war  inthe next few years.   It should be our  object to  remove this grave  weakness  in our defence organization at  the earliest possible date.   The removal  is dependent upon thefinancial aid which can  be made available for the  purpose.     11.  It  will  be agreed  that we  cannot  afford  to  leave  unsupported, for  an indefinite  period,   our  small,  highly   trained  and  expensively equipped  RegularArmy : to do so would  be to court disaster.  From a purely military  point of view,the  ideal would  obviously be to have reinforcing formations immediately available incase  of   need,  but  it is  recognized  that  financial  considerations  and the peaceorganization of the Territorial Army make this impossible.   It is considered, however,that a part at least of the Territorial Army must  be able to support the Regular army at the end of  four  months  after the outbreak  of war,  by which time  the personnelcould be adequately trained  ; and, further, that the  minimum  effective reinforcementwould comprise four divisions with the appropriate proportion of Corps Troops.     An examination has, therefore, been made of the  quantities  of unit equipment and reserves  which would have to be held in peace, in order to  enable a Territorial Armycontingent of that strength to take the  field at the end of four  months.   The cost ofproviding the requisite  equipment and reserves is given in B  of Appendix III.     In assessing  the requirements of such a contingent it has been assumed that thetraining equipment which  it would  hold in peace (under the scheme  to provide thewhole of the Territorial Army with equipment for training) could be taken as an  assettowards  the provision of war reserves.     12.  While reference has been made  in the preceding paragraph to  the  provisionof war equipment for a  contingent of a certain  strength, it is not proposed  that this equipment should  be allotted in peace  to  any particular formations: or - units.  It is   (624)                                                                   A 2
not desirable for reasons that are obvious to nominate divisions in peace for preferential treatment in war.   The equipment so provided would, therefore, be held as a pool  inpeace to be allocated in war as circumstances might dictate.     13. The additional industrial capacity that could be created by the provision  ofthe war equipment (including  reserves) of the contingent  specified  above would go far to maintain it in the field after the expenditure of its reserves.   But it would not do more than this (see paragraph 6 above).     14. The rate at which  further divisions can be despatched overseas will depend,as has been explained, on the quantities of war equipment and reserves held for themin peace, and the extent to which industrial capacity for their further equipment andmaintenance has been provided.     15. From  the  military  point  of  view, apart  from financial and industrialconsiderations, it is clearly unacceptable that, after the despatch of the first TerritorialArmy contingent referred to above, eight divisions should remain - unfit for war for afurther period of six  months, or more, that is to say until  their  war equipment and reserves, and their maintenance in the field, can be  provided by  means of industrial capacity created after mobilization.   - The  minimum military requirement  is  that the  eight other Territorial  Armydivisions  shall  be able to  take  the field  by the end of the seventh month after theoutbreak  of war ;   this will involve the  provision in  peace  of  part of their warequipment  and  reserves   (i.e., of  those items which  take   the  longest  time  to manufacture), and the creation  in peace of the industrial capacity needed to complete their equipment and to maintain them in the field.     16. It is hoped that the Cabinet  will now confirm the three decisions taken bythem at their Meeting 5 (37), and agree that  steps shall be taken to implement those decisions  on the basis of the estimates given  in the Appendices to this memorandum.The decisions may  be summed  up as follows :      (i) The Regular Army and the two Anti-Aircraft Divisions of the Territorial            Army to be provided with the most complete and efficient equipment with            the necessary war reserves.  Total cost is estimated to be  204,609,000 ;            the bulk of the programme to be completed by April, 1940.     (ii)  The remainder of the Territorial Army to receive sufficient equipment  of the            same type as the Regular Army to enable  the  whole  12 divisions  to  be            trained in peace.  Total cost estimated to be  9,2s5,000 ;  the bulk of the            programme to be completed by April, 1940.     17. It is further hoped that the Cabinet will give their consideration and acceptanceto the proposal contained in this paper that :-     (i) War equipment and reserves should  be provided for  a  Territorial  Army            contingent of four  divisions, and the  appropriate  proportion of  Corps            Troops, at an estimated capital cost of  43,381,000 ;  and that preparation            should  be made forthwith for  providing  as much  as  possible  of this            equipment by 1st April, 1941,                                     and that     (ii)  in order to  facilitate the correlation of the industrial resources of the country            with the requirements of the three Services, investigations should now  be            put in  hand with a  view to determining  the further industrial  capacity            required for maintaining in the field the&quot; remaining  eight divisions  of the            Territorial Army, and  for providing such of  their equipment  as could  be            manufactured after  the outbreak of war, on the assumption that they would            proceed overseas during the sixth and seventh months after the outbreak            of war.  The practicability should also be investigated  of creating that            capacity in peace, while at the same time providing the equipment referred            to in paragraphs 16 (i) and (ii) and 17  (i), together with that part of the            equipment of the eight divisions which should be held in peace time.             -  -   -  -    -  -               -    ... .

NOTES ON THE  MAIN CAUSES OF THE DIFFERENCES IN THE EXPENDITURE    NOW&apos;ESTIMATED  COMPARED WITH THAT SHOWN  IN D.R.C. 37  (NOVEMBER,    1935)A. Field Force.     The tank programme has been revised  and provision  has been made for  new types  and increased establishments.     An,  improved  equipment  (3-7-inch)  has  been  introduced, for trwo  Regular  Anti-AircraftGroups, in lieu of existing 3-inch equipment and provision is made for instruments,  searchlights,etc.,  for a  3rd  (Supplementary  Reserve) Anti-Aircraft Group,  which will be  armed  with thesurplus 3-inch equipments.    Provision is  made  for the conversion of Medium Artillery from 60-pdrs.  to 55-pdrs.     The estimate of cost  of the 25-pdr. artillery equipment  was found to be too low.     Provision is  made  for 40-mm.  anti-aircraft guns for defence  against low-flying aircraft.     Provision is made for reserves of food supplies, petrol, lubricants, general stores and clothing.     The increase in the equipment and establishment of units results in  increased expenditureon accommodation, storage,  etc.,  and  on inspection of stores  and equipment.   As  a  set-off to these increases there is a decrease on account  of ammunition provided  in D.R.C. 37 for the12 Territorial Army Divisions.C.^Defended Ports.     The increases for  ports abroad are due  mainly to the substitution of modern equipments(3-7-inch  and 4-5-inch)  for existing  3-inch anti-aircraft equipments  and the provision of 40-mm.anti-aircraft equipments;  and to an increased scale  of equipments at Singapore.  The revised scheme for home ports involves additional defences at Scapa Flow and  Invergordon,  and anti-torpedo motor boat defences.    * Provision for re-equipment  of Regular Field Artillery is included in the figures for field force material and Field Force ammunition.    t The Admiralty and Air Ministry will  contribute part of this cost.    t Excluding substantive Royal Ordnance Factories Votes of   1,550,000 the bulk of.whichcould fairly be regarded as attributable to the Defence Requirements Programme. .    5 Of this total  some  52,000,000 has been provided in 1936 and  1937  Estimates.
D. Air Defence of Great Britain (including Anti-Aircraft Defence  of Ports).    The  revised  scheme  approved  in  July,  1936,  raised  the  total  capital  expenditure to  27,451,000,  excluding  new factories and  storage  accommodation.   Subsequent  additionsare mainly  on account of  storage  accommodation and  war sites for  guns;  extra  drill  hallaccommodation; price  increases and extra  liners for 3-7-inch guns;  and  an increased scale  of40-mm. anti-aircraft equipment.E. Industrial Mobilization.    The plans for Industrial  Mobilization have been considerably enlarged since the compilationof D.Ei.C. 37  which provided  only  for the Army  share  of  the cost of  the new  government factories.  Provision is now made for the full  cost  of some  15 new Government factories, for various factories [e.g., for chemicals, explosives,  etc.),  to be  managed  by commercial firms,for plant, machinery  and  machine tools  required for the manufacture of warlike stores to  beinstalled in  factories  other  than the Royal  Ordnance Factories and for reserve  stocks  of certainraw materials.                    in.-POSSIBLE,  ADDITIONAL  COMMITMENTS    1. The  estimates of  capital  expenditure  and  of annual recurrent  cost  of personnel  inAppendix I  (I) and (IV)  contain no  provision  for  certain  commitments  which, though notbeyond the  range  of possibility,  are  either dependent on decisions of international policy or are too uncertain to permit of a reliable estimate  of cost being made.   Possible  commitments  ofthis sort are : -     (a) Provision  of anti-aircraft  defences for new  aerodromes  under  construction  at Hong          Kong;  and of further counter-bombardment, close and  anti-aircraft defences and  of          anti-motor torpedo boat defences should it be decided to raise the scale of  defence          owing to the lapse of the restricting clauses in  the Washington Treaty.    (b) Additional anti-aircraft defences for new aerodromes at Malta.    (c) Additional defences at Aden, if  Italy is  to be  regarded as a potential enemy.    (d) Additions in respect of ports at  present  in Category C which are  dependent on a decision          as to policy  in  the Near and Middle  East, particularly  in relation to Italy.    (e) Additions to the Air Defence of  Great  Britain which may  be decided as the result  of          the  &quot; Ideal &quot;  scheme  recommended  by  the  Home  Defence  Committee  (H.D.C.          Paper No. 220).  This would probably  involve,  as a first instalment, the -addition  of          the  following Army  units:               1  Group H.Q.,  4 anti-aircraft batteries and 26 searchlight coys., and possibly some                 additional light anti-aircraft batteries.    2.  Some additions  to the  estimate  of capital expenditure will be necessary  to  allow forthe acceleration of the rate of mobilization as set  out in paragraph.67, D.R.C.  37 (Vol. 1).   Thisquestion is  still  under examination.      IV.-ULTIMATE  RECURRENT ANNUApL  COST  (EFFECTIVE.  ONLY)  OF                               ADDITIONAL  PERSONNEL    1. In D.R.C. 37 provision was made as  follows: -    (a)  Regular Field Force..................     1,100,000 to  1,500,000                                                                    according to  rate  of                                                                    mobilization.    (b)  Defended Ports     ......    ......    .......     908,000    No estimate was given of the extra annual expenditure on new  Infantry  battalions or on additional Territorial Army personnel as the result of the Air Defence of Great Britain.    2. The  revised estimate, (March,  1937) is  as follows:      (a)  Regular  Field  Force    (b)  Defended Ports     ...    ...    ...     .......    (c)  New, Infantry  battalions    (d) Air Defence of Great  Britain- (Territorial Army.personnel)    3. Regular Field Force,. The main reasons for the increase are:      (i) When D.R.C. 37 was compiled, it was not possible to  work out the full implications in          personnel of the proposal &apos;to have  the Regular Field  Force prepared by 1st April,          1939,  and ready for disembarkation in the period set out in paragraph 67, D.R.C. 37          (Vol. 1).    (ii) The  addition to the peace establishments of the Regular Anti-Aircraft Groups to bring;          them  up to  war establishments  and  so  enable  them to  mobilize  immediately.
