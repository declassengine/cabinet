   OVERSEAS TRADE.   Imports in April at  82.9 m.  were  16.2 m.more than in April, 1936.   Nearly two-thirds of the rise was -in food and raw materials.    Of the increase of  5.7 m. inmanufactured goods,  1.7 m, related to non-ferrous metals and manufactures,  1.1 m. to oils, fats and resins and 708,000 to machinery.   Exports of United Kingdom products, 43.0 m. were  9.6 m. more and re-exports,  7.3 m., were 1.4 m. more than in April, 1936,   EMPLOYMENT,    There was a marked improvement in employment.The total number of unemployed persons on the registers at19th April - 1,454,443 - was 146,758 less than at-. 15th March;the reductions in the various Divisions were;-   London ........ -21,339    North Western ...  -18,163   South Eastern.. -13,766    Northern ........  -17,474   South Western.. - 9.951    Scotland.........  -22,051   Midlands...... -16,209    Wales ..____.....  -10,739   North Eastern.. -17,066     The estimated number of insured workers aged 16-64 inemployment (excluding agricultural workers) was 11,394,000 -152,000 more than in March and 609,000 more than inApril, 1936.     The improvement between March and April was most markedin building, public works contracting, stone-quarrying,coal-mining, shipbuilding and repairing, the-engineering,metal goods, motor vehicle, cycle and aircraft industries,the distributive and tailoring trades, and the transport andhotel, etc.  services.                     BOARD  OF TRADE ADVISORY  COUNCIL.                       STATE OF  TRADE  - APRIL,  1937t              Summary of  reports submitted by members  of the               Board  of Trade Advisory Council  (supplemented                     in some cases with  statistical                     information from  other  sources).
   RAILY/AY TRAFFIC.    In the four weeks ended 25th April,railway traffic receipts increased hy  332,000 (2.58$)compared with the corresponding period of 1936.    passenger traffic decreased &quot;by 11.03$, but merchandise, minerals and livestock and coal,  coke and patent fuel increased by 11.15$and 19.16$ respectively.   (The 1936 period included thewhole of the Easter  holidays, but the 1937 period onlyEaster Monday).   BANKING.   Money  was very plentiful throughout April-andthe Treasury Bill rate gradually weakened from 10s/10. 80to 10s/4.18.   Competition for Treasury Bills wasremarkably keen.   The money market was practicallyunaffected by the falls in stock and commodity prices.Rumours of an imminent change in American buying policyovershadowed the gold market and the price fell from142s/l  to 140s/3 .     In the foreign exchange market, sterling was strong.The franc was steady at 1061 at the beginning of April butthe American gold-price rumours caused a strong demand fordollars in Paris and the rate weakened to lllf with a discount of over 2 francs on the 3 months forward rate.  the dollar became weak towards the end of April, falling from$4.88f  to $4,951.   FINANCIAL CONDITIONS ABROAD.   In France  the Treasurysituation remained very unsatisfactory.   The New DefenceLoan (issued at 9 8)  stood at 94.4 on the 10th May.   Theindex of equities (1913 ^ 100) moved from 260 to  236 during april.   Dollars and sterling were allowed to appreciate toalmost  the legal limit.  In Belgium  stock markets were weak.Money was plentiful but the volume of new issues  remainedcomparatively, small.   In Holland the  inward movement of funds continued.   Stock markets were weaker.   The gold flowto the  United States continued.   Gold stocks on  the28th April amounted to $11,782 m. compared with $10,221 m.
caused concern.   SHIPPING..   A moderate amount of business was arranged inthe homeward chartering markets during April, and rates were well maintained.    The Ghamber of Shipping index number offreights (1913 = 100) was 147.05 as compared with 140.6 inMarch and 85.81 in April, 1936.   Orders for merchant tonnagecontinued to be placed but the increasing cost of new ships isembarrassing both owners and builders.   GOAL.   The improvement in the general conditions of thecoal trade was well maintained and there was every indication that (in the absence of labour troubles) it would continue forsome time.   The average weekly output during the 13 weeks ended the 24th April was 4.94 m. tons as compared with 4.62 m.tons in the corresponding period a year before.   Exports inApril amounted to 3.24 m. tons as compared with 2.54 m. tonsa year before.    Most markets took more, the chief increasesbeing to Prance and Italy;   the main decrease was to Canada.Wage rates were increased in several districts.   IRON AND STEEL.   The high level of home and foreign demand was fully maintained in April.   The increases in domesticprices announced on May 1st did not discourage demand.  during april five furnaces went into blast (one replacing a furnacewhich ceased operations).   Pig-iron output (680,700 tons)was 8.1$ more than in April, 1936.   Crude steel production(1,080,400 tons)  though rather less than in March was 9.8$more than a year before.   A resumption in the upward trend ofsteel production is likely in view of an improved scrapposition.   Supplies of semis to re-rollers improved somewhatowing to the arrival of tonnage from the Cartel, who, however,are still considerably in arrears with deliveries.   Foreignorders for steel continued to improve and producers maintained their efforts to satisfy overseas purchasers.   Exports of
                                                       *j ii iron and steel (239,500 tons) were 62,000 tons morethan in April, 1936, and reached the highest  monthly totalsince October, 1930.   Imports were considerably less.     All districts continued very busy.    In Scotland,Colville&apos;s announced plant extensions to include a new cokeoven battery, two new blast furnaces, additional meltingfurnaces and a plate mill.   On the North East Coast, anotherblast furnace started operations and two further furnacesare likely to be blown in soon.   Raw material supplies were rather more satisfactory.    In South Wales all restrictionson tin-plate production were removed.   ENGINEERING.    Activity further increased, despite the limitations of productive capacity.   Exports of machineryamounted to  4.1 m. as compared with  3,3 m. in April,  1936.Imports,  2.2 m.  were over  700,000 more, mainly because of increased imports of machine tools.   MOTOR INDUSTRY.   The number of motor vehicles newlyregistered in March was 48,520 - 2,495 more than a year before;  there was an increase of 3,426 in private cars, buta substantial decrease in goods and &quot;miscellaneous&quot; vehicles.The production of private cars in February was 28,449(10.4$ more than a year before) and of commercial vehicles8,468 (5.5$ less).   Exports of new private cars and chassisin April amounted to 5,834 and of now commercial vehicles andchassis to 1,358 - 30$ and 31$ respectively more than inApril, 1936.   1,876 complete new private cars were importedas compared with 1,299 a year ago,   ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.    In all directions works were engaged to capacity.   Difficulties in obtaining suitablelabour and materials increased.   The index for heavyengineering orders (both home and export) was considerably higher than for April 1936 but somewhat lower than for march 1937.   The amount of electricity generated hyauthorised undertakings was 17.9$ more than a year before.                            -4-
   NON-FERROUS METALS.    The fall in prices of non-ferrous metals from the high levels of the first part of Marchquickened during April.   Prices later became fairly steady andthe technical position of the metal markets much sounder.  Afair volume of trade buying is anticipated shortly.   WOOL.    The improvement in activity during March was notmaintained, the worsted section experiencing a definitedecline.    Raw wool prices rose considerably.   Exports  of topswere less but of yarns and tissues greater than a year before.Reports indicated a reluctance on&apos;the part of customers  toenter into forward commitments, due possibly to the recentsharp rise in prices.   SILK AND ARTIFICIAL SILK.     Rayon.   The volume of business in the  weaving trade waswell maintained.   Demand for crepe yarns  remained onlymoderate but prices continued firm.    .Makers-up of piecegoods reported an exceptional period of slackness.   Exports  ofyarns and all-rayon fabrics showed marked  increases overApril, 1936, but rayon  mixture exports were rather less.     Silk.   The weather adversely affected  sales  of naturalsilk fabrics, except those of tinsel type.   HIDES AND LEATHER.   The hide  market showed a ratherweaker tendency and prices  declined.   Conditions  in the  leathetrade varied from fairly active to quiet.   CHEMICALS.   Home sales  of alkalies reached the highestmonthly total this year, but exports fell  appreciably.Deliveries of chlorine products continued  satisfactory.   Homesales of dyestuffs were higher  than  in April,  1936, but  foreignsales were rather less.   Home  sales of sulphate of ammoniashowed a small increase over last season;    export  sales(excluding Spain) were  considerably  higher&apos; due to  increasedsales in Empire markets and  in  China.   Trade  was  active in coal  tar and  in wood distillation products and moderate  inpharmaceutical  chemicals.
  BUILDING...   Returns received by the Ministry of labour from 141 Local Authorities showed that the estimated cost  of buildings for which plans were, approved was  10.8 m.  -  16.1$more than the figure for April, 1936.   The increase fordwelling houses was 12.9$;  for factories and workshops 51$;and for other buildings and additions and alterations to existing buildings 14.7$.   RETAIL TRADE.    The money value of retail sales in Marchwas 15.2$ higher than in March, 1936;  part of thisexceptionally large increase was due to the early date  ofEaster and to Coronation preparations.   Sales of food andperishables rose by 16.4$ and of other merchandise by 13.5$.Preliminary returns for April indicate substantially less favourable results, Easter trade having taken place in March.   OANADIAN TRADE.   The index of physical volume of businessrose appreciably during March and the upward trend in production was resumed.   Compared with the previous month,exports of copper, zinc, asbestos, wood-pulp and shinglesincreased.   Nickel exports and newsprint production reachednew high points.   Crude rubber imports increased substantially,but imports of bauxite and crude petroleum declined while  theincrease in imports of textile raw materials was less thannormal for the season.   The iron and steel industry was more active.   SOUTH APRICAN TRADE.   The  surplus of  revenue overexpenditure for the financial  year 1936-1937 was over  5 m.Imports in  February were 20.6$ greater than in February,  1936.Exports (excluding gold) were  22.1$  more;  wool  shipmentsincreased considerably hut fruit exports  declined.   Goldexports were 30.7$ less  than in February,  1936 but  the tonnageof ore crushed was greater.    The maize market was  weak andunsettled throughout March;  in the  wool  market demand waskeen and prices firm.
   SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.     Argentina.   Exports during the first quarter of 1937established a record.    The surplus of exports over imports was equal to the visible favourable trade balance for thewhole of 1936.    Shipments of grain and fruit showed verylarge increases as compared with the 1st quarter of 1936.Meat shipments increased slightly, while wool exports thoughless in volume were greater in value.    The United kingdom share of total Argentine imports, despite a sharp recovery inMarch, was 19.8$ compared with 23.1$ during the first quarterof 1936.   The peso after appreciating during the first halfof April, declined sharply.   Livestock prices were higher.-     Brazil.   Coffee exports during the first quarter of 1937were less than a year before, though deliveries from othercountries to world markets increased.    Cotton exports during january/February were considerably greater than a year before..Germany&apos;s share of total imports increased sharply during1936 while the United Kingdom&apos;s declined.     Chile.    Economic conditions during the first quarterwere definitely good.    Mining production continued high andthe agricultural outlook favourable.   Copper output is at a record level and nitrate production satisfactory.  . total exports in January and February were considerably higher thana year before, but imports rather less.     Uruguay.  Deliveries of wool for the six months ended 12th March, 1937, were appreciably greater than ayear before.     Paraguay.    Business activity further expanded.     Colombia.    Internal industrial activity was well maintained but foreign trade declined.
