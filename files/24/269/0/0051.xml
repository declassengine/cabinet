COPY NO.,       . f^P. 146 (57.1*                           CABINET. -                             LAW REFORM.                 Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor.                  I desire authority for the drafting of Bills           mainly to carry out the recommendations of -                  (1) The Report of the Royal Commission on the                        Despatch of Business at Common Law                        (1936 Cmd., 5065);  and                  (2) The Fifth and Sixth Interim Reports of  the                        Law Revision Committee (1936 Cmd. 5334 and                        1937 Cmd. 5449).           (1) The^Report of the Royal Commission on the Despatch of                              Business at Common Law.                  The Royal Commission made recommendations on a           variety of subjects including circuits, quarter sessions           and the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court aid the County           Courts, some of which require legislation.   Their           recommendations with regard to circuits and quarter           esssirjns have been further considered by departmental           Committees, whose Reports I have now considered.  (Circuit           Towns Committee,  1956 Cmd? 5262, and Quarter Sessions           Committee 1936, Cmd. 5252)o                  The legislation required consists of amendments           of the Supreme.Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act,           1925, the Criminal Justice Act,  1925,  and the County Courts           Act,  1934, which need net be set out&quot;in detail at this           stage, but which are,  in my opinion, necessary or desirable           for Improving the despatch of business at common law,           (I propose tpi omit some of the recommendations which I
approve because I find that the3r would be toocontroversial)*       The above-mentioned reforms  could be carried out  inan omnibus Administration of Justice Billo    I  propose  toinclude in the same Bill certain other comparatively smallamendments of the Judicature and County Courts  Acts,  whichI desire to make and which have been waiting for inclusion in the next omnibus Administration of Justice Billo( 2 ) The Fifth and Sixth Reports of the Law Revision Committee       The Law Revision Committee is a standing Committeeof experts who have been requested by the Lord  chancellor to consider, amongst other things? -       (a) whether the statutes and rules of law relating             to the limitation of actions, require amend-             ment or unification; and       (b) in what respects the common law doctrine of             &quot;Consideration&quot; and the statutory  requirements             that certain contracts should be in writing,             (e,g. the Statute of Frauds) require             modification0       I have now received and considered the Reports cfthe Committee  ((a) 1936 Crndc 5534 and (b) 19 37  cmnd 5449).Their recommendations require legislations and  I thinkthat a Law Reform Bill ought to be drafted with a view to carrying them cut.       Eoth Bills will require consideration and con-suitation between the production of the first draft andtheir introduction,  and they should both be ready for introduction at the very beginning of the next Session atlatesto    They ..ught therefore to be drafted as soon aspossible, and I desire authority for this purpose.House of Lords,26th May, 1937,(Intdo)  H.2-
