CONFIDENTIAL.                                            A.C.576.                    BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL.                     STATE OF TRADE - MARCH, 1957.        Summary of  reports submitted &quot;by members of  the Board of         Trade  Advisory Council  (supplemented in some cases         with statistical information from other sources.).        EMPLOYMENT.   Employment  in March, in spite  of adverse     weather conditions, continued to improve in most of the     principal  industries.   The  total number of unemployed persons     on the registers at 15th March - 1,601,201 - was 26,644 less     than at 22nd February.  The  main variations were:-London .......South EasternSouth WesternMidlandsNorth Eastern- 10,171   North Western ...... - 4,241-  2,998   Northern.....:.....-t- 3,762-  6,871   Scotland ........... + 2,593-  3,060   Wales .............. - 7,646*  1,988     The estimated number of insured persons aged 16-64 inemployment (excluding agricultural workers) was 11,242,000 -55,000 more than in February and 553,000 more than in March,1936.     The improvement over February was most marked in coalmining, the. woollen and worsted industry, the clothing trades,furniture making, the distributive trades, and hotel andhoarding house service.   OVERSEAS TRADE.  Imports in March at  82.7 m. were  14.7 m.more than in March, 1936.  Over 70$ of the rise was in food andraw materials.   Of the increase of  4.2 m. in manufacturedgoods,  1.8 m. related to non-ferrous metals and manufactures, 653,000 to oils, fats and resins and nearly  400,000 tomachinery.   Exports of United Kingdom products,  43.5 m.,were  7 m. more and re-exports,  6.7 m., were  817,000 morethan in March, 1936.   RAILWAY TRAFFIC. In the four weeks ended 28th March, railway traffic receipts increased &quot;by  805,000 (7.22$) compared withthe corresponding period of 1936.  Passenger traffic increased
by 16.79$ and coal, coke and patent fuel by 8*12%? butmerchandise, minerals and livestock decreased by 2*46$.   SHIPPING.  There was general recognition that international trade was expanding.   In all directions markets weredisplaying a very firm tone and notable advances occurred in freight values  over a wide area.   The Chamber of Shippingindex number of freights (1913 = 100) was 140.6 in March ascompared with 139,, 15 in February and 89.19 In March, 1936.Time charter demand remained strong.  At the 1st April, 90,000net tons of shipping were laid up in Great Britain and ireland as compared with 212,000 at the 1st January and 474,000 at the1st April, 1936.   SHIPBUILDING.  Orders for new shipbuilding work were fullymaintained.  The Blyth shipyard is to be re-opened after beingclosed for seven years.   The improvement in ship-repairingcontinued.     The amount of tonnage under construction in GreatBritain and Ireland at 31st March was 1,014,000 tons gross(the highest quarterly total since September, 1930), asagainst 964,000 at 31st December, 1936, and 842,000 a yearage..   BANKING.   Money was in ample supply during the greater partof March,  but towards  the end of the month a combination of circumstances caused a temporary stringency.   The price ofgold remained steady between 142/2-g- and 142/7-gj   there-establishment in Prance of a free market caused somerepatriation of funds, but there were no signs of extensiverelease of hoarded money.  The dollar moved between 4.87-fand 4.89^.  The franc moved sharply from 105 to 108-g- followingremoval of the  control at the beginning of March, butlater showed a  firmer tendency, remaining steady between106^ and 106-f for the rest of the month;   the discount on thethree months franc was steady around if as compared with 3before the fall in the spot rate occurred.
   COAL.  The average &quot;&quot;weekly output during the 13 weeks ended the 27th March was 4,86 m. tons as compared with 4.70 m.tons in the corresponding period a year before.   The average number of wage earners employed was slightly more.  Exports inMarch amounted to 3.04 m, tons as compared with-2.63 m. tons ayear before.   Most markets took more, the chief increase being to Italy.   Only Germany.and the Netherlands took appreciablyless.   IRON AND STEEL.  Demand was fully maintained.  Every effort was made to increase pig-iron output by putting to work idlefurnaces.   During March five furnaces went into blast andthree ceased operations;   the scarcity of iron ore preventeda more rapid increase in production.-  Pig-iron output(680,300 tons) was 7.4 per cent more than in March, 1936, and higher than in any month since October, 1929.  Crude steel production (1,109,500 tons) was 15.2 per cent more than inMarch, 1936, and was a record.  A considerable improvement inscrap supplies is anticipated.   Overseas enquiry for finished steel was good and everything is being done to satisfy oldcustomers in spite of urgent home requirements.    Exports of iron and steel (231,600 tons) were 68,100 tons more than inMarch, 1936.   Imports were considerably less.     In Scotland, despite a record volume of orders,steelmakers had some idle plant owing to the shortage of rawmaterials.   On the North East Coast,  preparations are beingmade for a further increase in output of pig-iron:  work hasbeen completed on a new coke oven battery and two blastfurnaces have been modernised and v/ill soon resume operations.In South Wales, an additional blast furnace started operations.T-inplate works were active, with export demand improving, andworked to 69 per cent, of capacity.  Galvanised sheetproducers were better employed.                          ... -3-
                                                        6 X tl     ENGINEERING.   The volume of new business receivedcontinued to expand steadily.    Shortages of some materialscontinued and labour disputes created some anxiety.     Exports of machinery amounted to  5.9 m. as comparedwith  5.5 m. in March;, 1956.   Imports,  1.9 m., werenearly  400,000 more than a year before, mainly because of increased imports of machine tools.     MOTOR INDUSTRY.   The number of motor vehicles newlyregistered in February was 50,212 - 489 more than a year before;  there was an increase of 1,546 in private cars, buta substantial decrease in goods and &quot;miscellaneous&quot; vehicles.The production of private cars in January was 54,062 (7$more than a year before) and of commercial vehicles 11,427(11.6$ more).  Exports of new private cars and chassis inMarch amounted to 7,440 and of new commercial vehicles andchassis to 1,774 - 54$ and 60$ respectively,, more than in March1936.  1,631 complete new private cars were imported ascompared with 1,677 a year ago.     ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.    Activity gained momentum largelyas a result of defence orders. The index for heavy engineeringorders (both home and export) was considerably higher than for march, 1956;  as compared with the previous month, the homeindex showed no appreciable change, but the export index was higher.  The amount of electricity generated by authorisedundertakings was 18.3 per cent, more than a year ago.     COTTON.  Activity further increased.  Average weeklydeliveries of raw cotton to spinners were 31.1 m, lbs. ascompared with 50.1 m. lbs. in February.  Raw  cotton pricesadvanced.  In the American and Egyptian spinning sections,margins were appreciably increased \uider the  various priceagreements.  Yarn exports at 15.3 m. lbs. were greater than inany of the last twelve months.  Exports of piece goods at                         -4-
179 ra. sq. yds. were 19 m. sq.. yds. more than in February(where there was  one less working day) and higher than in any month since March 1935,   Exports to India increased by 6.8 m.sq.. yds. and there were also marked increases to South africa and Columbia;  exports to Australia and Egypt slightly declined.Wage increases were agreed for further classes in the weavingsection.   SILK AND ARTIFICIAL SILK.     RAYON.   Demand for yarns in the weaving trade remainedsatisfactory, most sections continuing busy.   The crepe yarnsection was somewhat quiet.   Demand for staple&apos; fibre, both for home and export improved.    The decline in rayon piece goodsprices appears now to have been checked.   Exports of yarnsand tissues showed substantial increases over March, 1936.     SILK.  Owing to the weather, business was belowexpectation save in the high-novelty and print sections.     WOOL.  Activity as a whole revived and was greater than inany corresponding month for the last ten years.   Raw woolprices rose.   Exports of tops were less but of yarns andtissues were greater than a year before.   There were no signsof a decrease in general activity beyond the normal seasonaldecline now to be expected,     HIDES AND LEATHER.  Hide markets were very active and priceof all classes advanced very considerably.   Leather prices were raised but were still well below replacement basis in mostsections.   Business in sole leather, glace kid and fancyleathers was fairly active;  in box and willow calf variable;and in side leathers restricted.     CHEMICALS.  Home and export sales of alkalis and deliveries of chlorine products showed substantial increases as comparedwith February.   Sales of dyestuffs, both home and export.
were better  than in March, 1936.   Home sales of sulphate of ammonia, and export sales  (excluding Spain), showed small increases compared with  the corresponding period of last season-Demand for sulphuric acid continued good.    Considerablebusiness was done in nearly all tar products.  Trade in wooddistillation products was good.   Wage increases were agreed.   POTTERY.  The general level of employment in February v/assubstantially higher than a year before.   The earthenwaresection was fairly active and sales of chinaware were reasonably good;  activity on Coronation ware was intensified in bothsections.   Glazed tile factories continued working to capacity.orders for electrical ware showed a substantial increase overFebruary, 1936.   RETAIL TRADE.  The money value of retail sales in february was 7.1$ higher than in February, 1935.  (This was appreciablyabove the average of the increases recorded for the previoustwelve months).   Sales of food and perishables rose by 6.5&apos;; andof other merchandise by 7.8*j.  Preliminary returns for Marchshowed a substantial improvement over March las^ year, no doubtpartly due to the earlier date of Easter.   CO-OPERATIVE TRADE (SCOTLAND).  The drapery trade was rather slow for immediate requirements, due to the inclementweather;   deliveries to Retail Societies showed substantial increases over 1936.    Sales in the furniture and furnishingdepartments continued to expand.   CANADIAN TRADE.    The index of physical volume of business during February v/as somewhat less than in January but 9fj morethan a year before.    Wholesale prices advanced by 14.3f&amp; overthe level of February,  1935.   Compared with the previous month,  figures of exports of copper,  nickel, gold, silver,asbestos and bauxite were higher (after seasonal adjustment).Exports of wood pulp,  shingles, planks and boards declined, but
the advance in newsprint production continued.   Imports of textile raw materials increased.  The iron and  steel  indusrty was more active.     COLONIAL TRADE.  Colonial trade generally  is expandingsubstantially.  The rise in commodity prices has been fairlygeneral (exception being oilseeds and nuts and  vegetable oils)and has increased very considerably the purchasing power of producers.  In the case of commodities subject  to controlschemes, increased prices have been accompanied by increased production.  The West African Colonies and Malaya are likelyto benefit most from the recent tendencies.  Exports  of orangesfrom Palestine have been much greater in volume than  lastseason but prices obtained have been much lower.     AUSTRALIAN TRADE.  2,494,000 bales of wool were  receivedinto store from 1st July, 1936, to 28th February as comparedwith 2,498,000 a year before, the quantity sold or shippedbeing 2,077,300 and 2,167,000 respectively.  Wheat and flourshipments from 1st December, 1936, to 24th March wereequivalent to 38.4 m. bushels of wheat as compared with 43.9 m.a year  before.  Butter shipments from 1st July, 1936, to27th March were 58,000 tons as compared with 80,000 tons ayear before.  Imports of merchandise during February amountedto  7.69 m. (Australian currency) as compared with  8.24 m. inFebruary, 1936.  In the six months ended 31st December, 1936,the favourable balance of trade in commodities  was  9.78m.(Australian) as compared with  7.03 m.  a  year  before.     SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE.  Imports in January were 11.4$greater than in January, 1936.  Exports (excluding gold)were 28.4$ more;  wool, diamonds and hides and skins, showedsubstantial increases, but fruit exports declined and maizeexports continued negligible.  Gold exports were 31.5$ less,but the daily average tonnage of ore crushed reached a new                       -7-
9-119record,   The final estimate of the wheat crop is rather lessthan la si. season.. . The maize market was weak, an exceedinglylarge  crop &quot;being  expected,   INDIAN TRADE.  Imports of merchandise, in March (13,10) lakhswere 2,31 lakhs more than a year before;  total exports(22,07 lakhs) were 5,71 lakhs more.   In most parts of Indiacrops were reported to be fair.   SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.      Argentina.  The peso appreciated slightly.  Cereal export sicontinued unusually heavy, wheat shipments reaching a record.Grain prices rose sharply, wheat ana linseed reaching thehighest levels since 1913.   The acreage of this season&apos;s maizecrop is estimated at 15;.o less than the unusually high 1935/36acreage.    The estimated yield of the 1936/37 wheat crop is nearly double last season&apos;s and rather more than the averageyield for the last ten years.   Exports and imports in thefirst two months of 1937 were greater than a year before, andthe favourable trade balance rose from $85 m. to  $360 m.;the United Kingdom shc.re of total Argentine imports fell from22.9/Q to 19.3$ while that of the U.S.A. rose from 14.1% to 17%,     Chile.   Increased copper exports contributed mainly to the favourable trade balance for January, which was the highestsince May, 1929.    Nitrate exports in 1936 increased by 7%and have  risen further this year.   The shortage of &quot;goldexchange&quot; for.the importation of luxury goods from non-compensation countries continued.     Brazil.   During 1936 the relative importance of coffeeexports declined;  cotton and cocoa showed significantadvances.   The 1936/37 coffee crop was -considerably in excessof the estimate and it is expected that the coming crop willlargely exceed export demands.     Peru.  The sol weakened.   Prospects for the cotton crop are  satisfactory.   Foreign trade figures for 1936 werethe highest ever recorded, while the favourable trade balance                         -8-
increased by &amp;fo over 1935;  imports from Great Britain in 1936increased appreciably.     Uruguay.   A conversion of part of the internal debt to  ab% basis reflects the recent improvement in Uruguay&apos;s credit.Total exports in 1936 declined and imports increased ascompared with 193 5.   Imports from Great Britain increasedmarkedly.     Paraguay.  Imports are increasing, but the currencydepreciation has adversely affected consumers&apos; purchasingpower.
