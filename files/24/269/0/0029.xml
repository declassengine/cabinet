[This Document is the  Property  of His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]    MEMORANDUM  BY  THE  SECRETARY OF  STATE FOR INDIA.   In a memorandum CP. (106) 37, dated 31st March, I explained to my colleagues the events leading up to refusal by the  Congress  Party to form  Ministries  in the six Provinces where that Party had  obtained  a  majority in the Legislatures.  on 8th April  I dealt with this matter  fully in the House of Lords on a Motion byLord  Lothian.  I explained then  in some detail why it  was impossible  for anyGovernor consistently with the duties imposed  upon him by Parliament to give  ageneral undertaking that he  would never use his special  powers to set aside theadvice of his Ministers, and I expressed my inability to understand on what  groundsMr. Gandhi had thought fit, in a statement which he had broadcast to the  Press on30th March, to assert that the assurance sought from the Governors was one  whichthey might easily have given and would have involved no more than acceptance bythem of a position which had frequently been  anticipated as the normal  position by &quot; Sir Samuel Hoare and other  Ministers.&quot;   This statement by Mr. Gandhi hadnot unnaturally produced much bewilderment both in India and in some  quartershere,  and suggestions had  been  made  that,  since  there  had  evidently beenmisunderstandings  as  to  the  scope and intended effect  of  the Congress  office-acceptance formula, it was desirable that the  Viceroy should make  some  movewhich would  enable these misunderstandings, and  with them  the obstacle  to aceptance of office by the Congress, to be cleared away.  In that connection  I usedthese words in my speech in the House of Lords :        &quot; It has also been  suggested in  connection with the present  situation,    that the Viceroy should send  for  Mr. Gandhi  in  the  hope, presumably,  of    persuading him to modify the attitude towards the acceptance of office which.    at his instauce, the Congress have taken up.  I confess that I find it difficult to    see what purpose would be served by such an action on his part.  This is. after    all, a question of the Governments in the Provinces under a system of Provincial    Autonomy, an outstanding feature of which is the relaxation  of  control by the    Centre, and as T have already explained, the  Governors in the  Provinces have    already taken the initiative by inviting the representatives of  the Congress to    form  Ministries.   It is  the Congressmen themselves  who have declined, and    unless they wish  to modify the attitude  which  they  have taken up  there is    obviously for the present  no more  to be  said.  On  the  other hand, if their    decision has, indeed, been due to a genuine misunderstanding of the  constitu-    tional position of the Governors, and if Mr. Gandhi, or  anyone  else representing    the Congress,  recognising now  the  real  constitutional  position  as I have    tried  to  explain  it this  afternoon,  was  to  express a desire in these altered    circumstances  to  see the Viceroy, I have  little doubt that the Viceroy would    approach the request with every desire to reach an understanding as  to what    the position  of the Congress leaders in the Provinces  actually is in the matter.     But it  is  clearly for those who have been under a  misapprehension, if such    indeed be the case, to say so.&quot;   2.  Since I made that speech Mr. Gandhi has given  to the world through thePress  three  further  pronouncements.  The  first  of these,  which appeared  inthe Press on 12th April,  had reference primarily to  a  letter  to  The  Times byLord  Lothian which  had  been published two  days before the Lords debate, butin it Mr. Gandhi also alluded to my speech.   While admitting  his ignorance  of the contents of the Government of India Act and  of  the Select committee&apos;s Report,Mr. Gandhi maintained that his advice to the Congress to  accept office only on the assurance demanded from the Governors was based upon  legal opinion &quot; that the governors could give this assurance without infringement of the Act,&quot; and hesuggested that the matter should  be put to the  test  by referring to an arbitralPrinted for the Cabinet.

 tribunal of  three Judges (one to be appointed by the Congress, one by the Govern- ment, and the third to be co-opted by the other two) the question of the competence of  the Governors to give the desired assurance, and  the further question whether the appointment of &quot; minority ministries &quot; was legally valid.    3. The  second statement was  issued on 16th April  and had reference to a second letter to The Times, in which Lord Lothian had expressed surprise that the Congress should attach so much importance to formulae and assurances, and had laid  stress  on  experience elsewhere as  showing that in the last resort the  Indian electorate must inevitably be in a position  to decide whether a policy which had been proposed to a Governor by his Ministers, but which he had refused to endorse, was  to be put into effect; since the-  Governor would,  in  practice, have to  decide whether it  was better in the long run for the peace and good government of  his Province to attempt to resist  by means of his special powers  a policy  which ex hypothesi had been endorsed by the return to  power after a dissolution of  the Party which had originally proposed it, or to  accept the verdict of the electorate, and in many cases he would almost inevitably accept the latter as the lesser  of two evils. Mr.  Gandhi&apos;s reply to this theoretical constitutional thesis was  to interpret it as  a concrete suggestion that all differences between a Governor and his Ministers should be made the occasion for a dissolution and an appeal  to the electorate and, as  such,  he gave  Lord Lothian&apos;s  &quot; suggestion &quot; a qualified blessing as  offering a possible way out of the impasse.    4. Finally, on 22nd  April,   Mr.  Gandhi  gave an interview to the Manchester Guardian correspondent  in which he is reported as having said  that  the  assurance sought from the Governors meant &quot; only an assurance of non-interference in  day-to- day, administration,&quot; but that  a Governor in  a grave  emergency would have &quot;to dismiss a Cabinet if it persisted in committing a  stupid blunder and  to order fresh elections where the Cabinet had the support  of a  majority of the Legislature.&quot;    5. The effect of these three statements and of  the voluminous discussions  round and about them in the whole of  the Indian Press  has been to deepen the impression previously held that there are misunderstandings which are  capable by  tactful handling of being cleared away.   It  has accordingly  been urged upon me from more than one quarter that no considerations, whether  of prestige or otherwise, ought to stand  in the way of some move  by the Viceroy towards Mr. Gandhi  and/or his Congress colleagues which might result in removing misconceptions and arriving at understandings on the basis  of which the Congress might be in a position to reconsider its position and permit its  followers  to accept  office.   Those who take this view contend further that, if nothing is done in this direction, the Governmentwould be open  to grave criticism as having mishandled  the situation if the Congress were  to decide, for instance, that the deadlock is complete  and that  the answer toit must be  a renewal of the civil  disobedience  movement.  Accordingly,  thoughthe Viceroy  and I had agreed  immediately after my speech of 8th April that wewere  not called upon to  make   any move in order to facilitate the  extrication  of itself by  Congress out of its self-created  difficulties if that indeed is what Congressdesired and that our policy should for a time at  all events be to wait upon  events, I none the less  put to him on 23rd April the other point of view and asked  for his opinion.    6. The Viceroy  is emphatically of  the  opinion that it  would be most impolitic for him to take any initiative for the  pi-esent  in the direction of conferring either with  Mr. Gandhi or  the  Congress leaders on this matter.  He is confident, despite the general view to the  contrary canvassed  in the Press  in  India and elsewhere, that, the inner caucus of  the Congress  (including Mr. Gandhi) were perfectly aware when they pressed the  Governors for the undertakings sought from them in each of the six Provinces that they were asking  the Governors to do  something which they  could  not do.  It is indeed  a fact  that,  in  the course of  informal  and confidential conversations which took place between Lord Erskine and  Mr. Rajago- palachari, the Madras Congress leader, before the undertakings were asked for, the latter was clearly and definitely informed that it would not be possible  to give such undertakings ;  and  it  can  be safely assumed that  Mr. Rajagopalachari  passed this on to Mr. Gandhi if not to  the rest of the Working Committee.  consequently the Viceroy  feels strongly that there is  no hope, if negotiations were to be enteredupon, of  arriving at any  understanding which would be  acceptable to the congress on the basis of acceptance by them of the Constitution Act with all its implications,
 and that if negotiations were entered upon and were to result in agreement by the Congress leaders  to permit  their followers in the Provinces to accept office, this agreement could only be on a basis  of  some undertaking which would,  in effect, involve a renunciation by the Governors of some at all events of the duties and powers imposed upon them by Parliament.  (That this view is justified is confirmed by statements made by Mr. Gandhi to the correspondent of the News Chronicle and published  in  the  issue of 27th April.)  Obviously  it  would be unthinkable that negotiations should be opened with any  such  possibility in view.  But, apart  from this, the Viceroy is confident that any move in the direction  of attempting to  meet the Congress point of view would seriously disturb the Services, civil  and military, would greatly alarm the Princes, would  undermine  the position of  the Ministries now functioning in those Provinces where  there is not a Congress  majority (to say nothing  of the  minority Ministries holding office in the  Congress Provinces), and would immediately raise the prestige of Congress, which has already been  much enhanced by their  success at the recent elections, to such a pitch  that it would cease to be a political party and would be  regarded by the  country as a whole  as the master of India.   Perhaps I  should add here that the Viceroy does not suggest  that a stage in the developments  in connection with this matter may not be reached in the  future at which discussion between him and the Congress may not become desirable, but his own instinct, as he put it in a recent telegram to me, is &quot; very strong aversion from it at this stage.&quot;    7.  On the  other hand, it is only right that I should inform my  colleagues that the Viceroy has made it  plain to me that in his opinion  if  the  decision  is,  as  he urges that  it must be, to take our stand on  the strict  interpretation of the Act and to refuse to parley on possible mitigations of its effects and intentions in the matter of &quot; safeguards,&quot; we must be prepared to face  the possibility  of a  crisis of a grave and persistent nature and a period perhaps prolonged of much anxiety.  Should the  Congress decide  to  adopt and  launch  a renewal of the  civil  disobedience movement, he feels that the grip which it has secured over the rural population in large parts of  India would almost certainly enable it to make such a movement far more effective and troublesome  than it was  on the  last occasion,  and that the combination of widespread disturbances  in India, with possibly large-scale trouble on the North-West Frontier, would provide very serious possibilities.   None the less  he is  convinced that, with the support upon which he  is counting  from His Majesty&apos;s  Government,  even these  formidable  possibilities can  be  faced  with equanimity.   Although he sees no sign  at present  of any  split  in  the  Congress under the pressure of  events, he  thinks that the supporters of  Congress in the Provinces will inevitably find some way of  escape sooner or later from  the impasse which Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Nehru have created for them, and  he is firmly of opinion that this possibility is the more likely to arise the more plainly the Congress is given to understand  that it is useless  for it to expect any willingness on the part of the Viceroy or His Majesty&apos;s Government  to whittle down the effect of  the Constitution as provided by the Act of 1935, whether  by amendment or by undertakings having substantially the effect of amendment.   8. I have set forth above briefly, but  I  hope  clearly, the very emphatic opinion of the Viceroy  as to  the attitude  which  we should adopt in face of the present deadlock.  Let me add the reasons which have led me to a similar  conclusion.   It is  admittedly difficult  to  know what Mr. Gandhi really has in mind.  He is undoubtedly primarily concerned at  the  present, time to prevent a  split in the ranks  of the  Congress.  He is an  adept at  evolving  formulas  which can be interpreted in  one  sense by one set of  people and in  an opposite sense  by others. It was by the drafting of such a formula that  he staved off a split in  the  Congresswhen the question  of office acceptance was under consideration  in March, but the inevitable result of his ingenuity was  that  those who  believed that they had wonthe day and were free to accept office found that  they had  been sold.   The reports which I  have received from  the Governors point to  two  things, firstly, that  therewas  genuine  surprise  and considerable  dissatisfaction amongst those who were anxious to take office when they discovered that  they had been sold, and secondlythat  the hold of  the caucus over the rank  and file of the Congress  is  very great.Which of these two influences the dissatisfaction of Bight Wing Congressmen or the hold  of the caucus will prove the strongest in the long run it  is impossible tosay; but it is clear, I  think, that any  gesture  by the Viceroy such as an invitation
 to Mr. Gandhi or Pandit Nehru to discuss the position with him would, by ad ding- to the prestige of the caucus, increase still further its hold over the rank  and file. It- is, therefore, very desirable that before contemplating any such approach  by the Viceroy, we should  consider the real aim which those who at present control  the Congress  have  in  view.&apos;  T have given reasons for believing that  Mr. Gandhi knowingly sold the Right Wing of the Congress over his formula on office acceptance. If this is, in fact, the case, his action  can only have been due to the fact that in his attitude towards the  Constitution he is in closer accord with Pandit Nehru than with the Right Wing of the Congress.   And Pandit Nehru&apos;s object is quite frankly, and, let me add, quite honestly, stated, by Pandit  Nehru  himself.  He has never attempted to disguise his intention of doing everything within his power to prevent the  scheme of  government embodied in the Act of 1935 from functioning, and in pursuance of his object he has never  ceased from inveighing against the acceptance of office by Congress.   It would seem to follow, then, that in  so far as Mr. Gandhi favours the acceptance of  office,  if  at  all, he does so in the  hope of wrecking- the  Constitution from within;  and  his  anxiety to emasculate the Act by under- mining the reserve powers  vested in the Governors becomes intelligible.  He has, in fact, admitted this in so many words on more than one occasion.    9. It is in  these circumstances that I have supported the Viceroy in his  rejection of the suggestion that he should send for the  leaders  of the Congress with a view to discussing  the difficulty which they have found in accepting office, involving, as any  such action on his part must necessarily do, discussion  of the safeguards to which -the Congress object.  If  my reading of the situation is correct, the present deadlock  can  only be brought  to a  satisfactory end  by the inner Council  of  the Congress giving up  the  idea of wrecking the Constitution,  of which I see no likelihood, or of the Right Wing of the Congress breaking away from the tyranny of the caucus.   10. I shall  be glad of the approval *of my colleagues in the policy which  I ampursuing.  I. am most anxious to see that section of the Congress which is not  out to wreck the Act take office in the six Provinces in which they command a majority.I  consider that this purpose will be  best served, not  by attempting  negotiations at the Centre  which would be bound  to  resolve themselves into a  question of concessions on points  of  substance, but by exploiting any opportunity that  may occur for  contacts between the  Governors  and the Congress leaders in  theProvinces ; the issue being one of provincial  autonomy this  is the constitutionalpoint of contact, and it is  also in my opinion the point at which contact has the best chance of leading to practical results.   11. Since  writing  the  foregoing  paragraphs  I  have  received news of  theresolution  adopted by the  Congress on 28th  April.  It may be  noted  that  theCongress  do  not in their  resolution burn  their  boats  or   issue  a challenge.Nevertheless, it shows  no  signs  of compromise  and it  confirms the view of myself and the Viceroy that the difference between us and  those who are dominating  theCongress  policy is one which  could be resolved, not by any explanations  of a conciliatory nature,  but  only by substantial  concessions  such as we could  not possibly contemplate.
