TTilS DOCUMENT IS TUB PROPERTY. OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.Copy No.                            THE LONDON BUS DISPUTE.                     Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Labour.     My colleagues may care to have an appreciation of the  present position ofthis dispute.   The failure of the negotiations last week was due to  two reasons:   (a) the Central Bus Committee of the Union, which set  the  pace forthe Executive, wished to secure agreement to the principle  of the 7-g-  hourmaximum day and were not prepared to consider any other method of easement oftheir conditions;    (b) the Committee relied upon the surrender of theLondon Passenger Transport Board at the last moment.   The  latter expectationwas due to the fact that, in almost every dispute during the Board&apos;s  history,some last-minute concession to Mr. Bevin has been made after a deadlock load&quot;been readied.   The fact that the grant of the Tg- hour day  to the bus workers would inevitably have to be made also to tram and trolley bus workers caused the Board to maintain their attitude of opposition on this  occasion.    I maymention that the question of appointing a Court of Inquiry  was continuously .under my consideration in connection&apos;with the negotiations  which preceded the stoppage.   I was satisfied that it was the better plan to  keep this  in reserveso long as the negotiations were proceeding.   If a Court of Inquiry  had beenappointed earliei&quot; the Union would have accused the Government of prejudicing asettlement and would have declined to attend.     Many members of the Committee were shaken in their views by thenegotiations and it was only after nearly six hours1 discussion that  the delegate Conference decided in favour of a strike.   They fully expected,however, that this decision would force a surrender in the  remaining hours ofFriday last and they were greatly surprised when no such surrender took place and they found themselves faced with the result of their decision.    TheUnion Officials feared  such a surrender as they knew that the result  would beconstant unrest and indiscipline in the future.   The cooler heads realise thatthe 7-g- hour policy is not a solution of the difficulties and that theconsequences of this policy would probably be productive of serious wagestroubles arising from the necessary re-arrangement of duties.
     The Central Bus Committee is now in a chastened, state of mind and theylook to Mr. Bevin to get them out of their trouble.    He would like to securethe Tg- hour day but, if it is seen that there is no  disposition to secure peaceat any price, he will doubtless consider other less  onerous tezms.   It isimportant,  therefore, to allow the Court of Inquiry  at least to have the caseof both sides fully presented without undue haste.      A complication whichnone of the Unions desires is that the Tube, Tram and Trolley Bus services may become involved as they might do if pressure upon them is too groat.   It isnecessary to avoid any step that can be seized upon  as justifying a stoppage ofany of these services.    It is realised by the Unions that, if that occurred,they would be faced with the creation of emergency services which would probably have public support.     My Department is keeping in touch with &quot;both sides and we shall take thefirst proper opportunity of bringing the stoppage to an end.                                          (Intd.)   E.B.Ministry of Labour.4th May, 1937.H.Q.147-70 E.G.
