Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1937.SECRET.                                                        Copy  No.CP. 149 (37).CABINET.                              PALESTINE.DESIRE OF THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON PALESTINE TO QUOTE EXTRACTS FROM THE           MCMAHON-HUSSEIN CORRESPONDENCE IN THEIR REPORT.        Memorandum by  the Secretary of State  for Foreign Affairs.    MY colleagues will be aware that in 1915 and  1916 a number of letters (com-monly called the McMahon-Hussein correspondence) were exchanged between sir henry McMahon, His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner at Cairo, and the Sherif andEmir of Mecca, who afterwards became King Hussein  of  the Hejaz, regardingthe entry of the Arab peoples into the World War on the side of the Allies.  this correspondence was preceded by, and  referred to, some  messages (which I may call the Kitchener-Abdullah correspondence) transmitted by Plis Majesty&apos;s HighCommissioner at Cairo between Lord Kitchener and the Emir Abdullah, a son of king Hussein and  now the Emir of Transjordan.    2.   The McMahon-Hussein correspondence (which was conducted  in Arabicon both sides)  dealt, inter alia,  with the territory in which the  independence ofthe Arabs was to be recognised should the Ottoman Empire suffer defeat in thewar; and violent  controversy has since raged at various  times over  the exactinterpretation  of  the pledge which Sir  Henry McMahon gave King Husseinabout this territory.    3.   The controversy  arises mainly  over  the following  passages in the correspondence :     (a) In a  letter dated  the  14th  July,  1915, King  Hussein  claimed thefollowing boundaries for the future Arab State :           &apos;&apos; England to acknowledge the  independence of the  Arab  countries,    bounded on the north by Mersina and Adana up to 37Q of latitude, on which    degree falls Birijik, Urfa,  Mardin, Midiat, Amadia Island (Jezireh), up to    the border of Persia; on the east by the  borders of Persia up to the Gulf of    Basra; on the  south, by the Indian Ocean, with the exception of the position    of Aden to remain as it is; on the west, by the Red Sea, the Mediterranean    Sea up to Mersina.&quot;    (b) After  some intermediate letters,  Sir  Henry McMahon wrote on the24th October, 1915 :-         &quot;I have realised, however, from  your last letter, that you regard this    question [i.e.,  that of boundaries]  as one of vital  and urgent importance.  I    have therefore lost no time in informing the  Government of Great Britain    of  the  contents  of  your   letter;  and  it  is  with  great pleasure that  I    communicate  to you on their behalf the following  statement  which, I am    confident,  you  will receive with satisfaction :           &quot; The districts  of Mersina and Alexandretta and the portions of Syria    lying to the west of the districts of  Damascus,  Horns,  Hama and Aleppo    cannot be said to be purely Arab,  and should be excluded  from  the proposed       9264  [15274]                                               B
    limits and boundaries.  With the above modification and without prejudice    to  our existing  treaties with Arab  chiefs we accept  these  limits and    boundaries, and in regard to those portions of the territories therein in which    Great Britain is free to act without detriment to the interests of her ally,    Prance, I am empowered in the name  of the Government of Great Britain    to  give the following  assurances  and  make the following  reply  to  your    letter : .         &quot; Subject to the above  modifications,  Great Britain  is prepared  to    recognise and support the independence of the Arabs within the territories    included in the  limits and boundaries proposed by the  Sherif  of Mecca.    Great Britain will guarantee the Holy Places against all external aggression    and will recognise their inviolability.&quot;    4.  In order to  understand fully the  arguments used on both  sides,  it isnecessary to take account of  various factors, such as the nature of the claims which the French Government had at that  time put forward in regard  to Syriaand Palestine,  the precise meaning of the terms &quot;Syria&quot; and &quot;District&quot; andcertain  concurrent discussions between Sir Henry McMahon and representativesof the Syrian nationalists.  But I need not enter into these questions here.  It is sufficient  to say that  the Arabs have consistently held that  there is nothing  in Sir Henry McMahon&apos;s letter to indicate  that what  is now Palestine was to  be excluded from the area of Arab independence and that His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave as consistently held  that his  words were intended to exclude Palestine and did exclude it.    5.  I have therefore learnt  without  surprise  that the  Arabs  who  gave evidence before the Royal  Commission laid the strongest emphasis upon theMcMahon-Hussein correspondence,  which,  according  to their  interpretation, istotally at variance with the later  &apos;&apos; Balfour Declaration &apos;&apos; and the Mandate forPalestine, at any rate in the form in  which  the Mandate  was adopted.  TheCommission feel very naturally  that they cannot possibly ignore this correspon-dence, seeing how large  a part it played in the Arab evidence, and that theirReport  would, moreover, be deprived of much of its authority  and value if theywere merely to describe this correspondence in general terms and not to quote it.    6.  Furthermore, the Commission, although they do not intend to pronounceupon  the  proper interpretation  of  Sir Henry McMahon&apos;s pledge, wish  to place the interpretation given  by His Majesty&apos;s Government in as favourable a lightas possible, and they  feel that they can do this also  in a more effective mannerby  quoting from  the  correspondence  rather  than confining  themselves  togeneralities.  They have  accordingly included the  more important passages  inthe draft of a chapter  in which they deal with the Arab revolt, and have expressedthe hope that  His Majesty&apos;s Government will  see no objection to the quotationof these passages.    7.  The necessity for any such approach to His Majesty&apos;s Government arises from  the fact, of which my colleagues will be aware, and of which the membersof the Royal Commission are also  aware,  that,  in  spite of strong pressure  inParliament, successive Cabinets have held  that  the  official  publication  of this correspondence would be contrary to the public interest, and have  declined  to confirm or deny the accuracy  of such versions (obtained from Arab  sources)  a shave appeared in the  English or Arabic press.   The last decision on  the subject was taken by  the Labour Government  [Mr. Ramsay  MacDonald&apos;s Cabinet]  inOctober 1930.    8.  The principal reasons for the reluctance of His  Majesty&apos;s Governmentto agree to official publication have been :     (a)  The correspondence is incomplete  and inconclusive, and in order  to make           clear the real intention of Sir Henry McMahon&apos;s pledge and to justify           His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s interpretation of its meaning, it would           be necessary to offer a great many additional explanations;  further-           more, any  such discussion would revive old controversies which were           better forgotten.
    (6)  The correspondence,  and the Kitchener-Abdullah correspondence also,          shows that His Majesty&apos;s Government suggested to King Hussein that          he might assume the Caliphate in place of the Ottoman Sultan, and          the fact that such a suggestion was  made might cause resentment          among Indian Moslems.  (This  is a reason which few of those who          press for publication are  likely to  have guessed, and it would,  of          course, be impossible to give it were the question of why publication          had previously been withheld ever to be pressed in the future.)    9.  The reasons given to Parliament may be  illustrated by  the  followinganswer given by  Dr. Shiels to Mr. Cocks on the 1st August, 1930 :         &quot; .  .  . . There are still  valid reasons,  entirely unconnected with  the    question of  Palestine, which render it in the highest degree undesirable in    the public interest to publish the  correspondence.  These reasons  may  be    expected to retain their force for many years to come.....&quot;    10.   The  first of the reasons given in paragraph 8 has obviously  lost itsforce  to-day, seeing that the Arab leaders in Palestine, who appear to have  thewhole of the correspondence  in  their possession,  have based the whole of their case upon it, and that the meaning of the correspondence has of itself, withoutany official publication having taken place, become a matter of acute controversy.    11.   The position  with regard to the second reason is more doubtful.  Theextracts which the Royal Commission propose to quote do not include the passagesrelating to the Caliphate.  On the other hand, the quotation of these passageswould probably lead to a demand, which it  would be difficult for His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment to withstand, for the official publication of the whole correspondence.If this demand  were accepted,  I cannot state positively that it might not havethe effect  of bringing the suggestions regarding  the Caliphate to the attentionof the Indian  Moslem public for the first time,  for, although the versions of  the correspondence which  have appeared in the English  press (the  Daily Mail ofJanuary 1923) have omitted the passages about the Caliphate, I have no infor-mation as to whether the versions which have appeared in the Arabic press, andparticularly, so I understand, in the Palestine press, have included  these passagesor not.    12.   I doubt, however, whether,  having regard to the fact that the TurkishRepublic has long since repudiated  the Caliphate,  and that  the suggestions towhich exception might be taken were  made to  so  respected a Moslem as  the hereditary guardian of Mecca and Medina, Indian Moslem opinion would feelvery  strongly  to-day about  a question which  has  become  of purely  historicalinterest.    13.   But whatever may be thought about this  point I  do not see that HisMajesty&apos;s Government can reasonably ask the Royal Commission to refrain fromquoting the passages of the  McMahon-Hussein correspondence  which relate tothe territorial pledge (and which they have in  any case obtained  independentlyfrom  other sources than His  Majesty&apos;s  Government).  It would clearly,  as theymaintain, weaken the value and authority of their Report to omit these quotations,nor would  their omission be  of any ultimate advantage  to His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment.  Furthermore,  I  feel  convinced  that, whether the Commissionactually  quote the correspondence or not,  the  pressure in  Parliament for fullpublication  in connexion with  the discussion of the Commission^ Report willbe so  strong that it will be impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to withholdit any longer.   This  may also necessitate the  publication of  the Kitchener-Abdullah correspondence, but  I do not think that  there  would be  any moreobjection to this than to the publication of the main correspondence.    14.  Since,  therefore, the publication of the  correspondence will not, so  faras I can see, furnish those whose interpretation of Sir Henry McMahon&apos;s pledgeis different from that of His  Majesty&apos;s Government with any information whichthey do not possess already, and since the effects on Indian Moslem  opinion are atthe most problematical, I suggest that His  Majesty&apos;s Government should agreeto the publication in the Report of the Royal Commission of any extracts from      9264  [15274]                    &apos;                          B 2
the correspondence that the Commission may desire, and should decide to accedewithout delay to any subsequent demand which  may be made for full  officialpublication.    15.  I attach hereto a copy of  the draft of the chapter on the Arab revoltin the Royal Commission^ Report which contains the extracts under discussion.                                                                   A.  E.    Foreign Office, May 27, 1937.                               ANNEX.Draft of Chapter II of the Report of the Royal Commission on Palestine.                     THE WAR AND THE MANDATE.                            1. The Arab Revolt.    1.  For many years before the War. the Arab Provinces of the turkish empire had been restive under the rule of the Sultan at Constantinople, and theTurkish Army had often been engaged in repressing the outbreaks of the free-spirited tribesmen in the Arabian Peninsula.   No less dangerous to Ottomanascendancy  was  the growth, of  a nationalist  movement among  the youngintelligentsia of Syria.  Its origin may be traced to the awakening, about 1860,of a new interest in Arab history and culture.  Societies were established for the study of the Arab golden age and the revival of Arabic literature.  The movementgained  impetus  from the foundation in  1866 under American auspices of  the syrian Protestant College, soon to be famous throughout the Near East as RobertsCollege.  It did admirable work in acquainting the youth of Syria with the ideas of the Western world; but among them  were the ideas of self-government andnationality; and nationalism  was as inevitably stimulated by American education in Syria as it was by British education in India,   For a generation and more thecause made little headway under the despotic rule of Abdul Hamid, but the coupcFEtat of  the Young Turks in 1908 seemed for a moment  to have opened a newage of freedom throughout the Empire.   A constitution was  wrested  from  the sultan, based on the representation of all  the Provinces.  In the first Parliament,however, the Syrian Arabs were greatly under-represented in  the Lower House,and they only had three out of forty seats in the fjpper House; and  it w-as soonplain that the hopes of autonomous Arab provinces,. free  to develop Arab life and culture to  the full,  were to  be disappointed.  The efficient Committee  of union and Progress stood for centralisation, not local &quot; home-rule,&quot; for &quot; Turcifi-cation &quot; rather than an  Arab renaissance.  Arab nationalism was thus drivenunderground.   From 1909  onwards secret societies  were founded in Paris,Constantinople,  Cairo, Damascus  and Beirut;  an  Arab  Congress was held inParis  in 1913;  and the idea gained currency of a general Arab rising,  if  afavourable opportunity should occur, and the creation of a free and united arab state with its capital at Damascus.  The Turkish Government was not withoutall knowledge of this seditious propaganda, and did what it could to suppress it.The trial of Aziz Ali in 1914 excited considerable attention in Western Europe.    2.  Such was the position when, on the 31st  October, 1914, the ottoman empire entered the War.  Two  dangers were at once apparent  to the AlliedPowers. Syria and Palestine might be made the base for a Turco-German attackon the Suez  Canal;  and the prestige of the Caliphate might be used in an attemptto raise all  Islam against the Allies in a Jihad or Holy War.   To meet the firstdanger, troops  were concentrated  in Egypt.   To meet  the  second, negotiations were  opened Avith Husein, Sherif  and Emir of Mecca  and hereditary guardianof the Moslem Holy Places of Mecca and Medina.  Husein and his people had long  cherished  similar ideas of throwing off the Turkish yoke to those of  the
Syrian nationalists, and it was intimated to him that his participation in theWar on the Allies&apos; side might lead  to that result.  When  the  Sultan-Caliphproclaimed the Jihad at Constantinople in November, Husein refused to allowit to be preached in the mosques of the Holy Cities. But he took no further action,and the next move came from the British  side.   In  June 1915 British policy asto the future of Arabia Proper was made clear by  the issue of a proclamationin Egypt, the Sudan and Arabia, announcing that at the conclusion of peace theindependence of the Arabian Peninsula would be assured.    3.   But there were  other Arab  Provinces in the Turkish  Empire, and otherthan British interests involved in its possible disruption.  In  March 1915 theFrench Government explained that  in that event France would claim control of Syria, including (as the  term had long included) Palestine.  This proposition was discussed by a Committee of the British Cabinet, which reported, in June 1915,that the French claim to northern Syria should be conceded,  but that, owing tothe world-wide importance of the Holy Land, Jerusalem and part of palestine should be reserved for international administration.    4.   Meanwhile, the fortunes of the Allies in  this field of  the War hadprospered.  In February 1915 the Turco-German attack on the  Suez Canal wasdecisively repulsed.  In  April the Allied occupation of Gallipoli began;  and sohopeful seemed its prospects for the  first few months  that by July rumours of the approaching fall of Constantinople were  spreading through the  East.   Arabopinion reacted quickly. In the first place, the secret Nationalist  Committee in syria decided to reject the promises  of independence offered them by the Turkishand German Governments, and to make common cause with the Sherif of Mecca.Secondly, in a letter  dated the  14th July,  1915, Husein informed Sir HenryMcMahon,  then High Commissioner in Egypt, as to the terms on which he was prepared to co-operate  with  Great  Britain  against the Turks.    The essentialpassage of the  letter was as follows :         &quot;  England to  acknowledge the independence of  the  Arab countries,    bounded on the north by Mersina and Adana up to 370 of latitude, on which    degree falls Birijik, Urfa, Mardin, Midiat, Amadia Island (Jezireh), up to    the border of Persia; on the east by the borders of Persia up  to the Gulf of    Basra; on the south by the Indian Ocean, with  the exception of the position    of Aden to remain  as it is;  on  the west by the  Red Sea,  the Mediterranean    Sea up to  Mersina.&quot;    This claim, of course, went far beyond the already-promised independence ofthe Arabian Peninsula.   It embraced almost the whole Arab  world in Asia.  Itwas clearly inspired  to no slight  extent  by the ideas of Syrian nationalism.Sir H. McMahon, in a friendly and encouraging reply, declared that the discussionof boundaries  was premature.    5.  A  few weeks later the Allied cause  received a serious set-back.  On the10th August the British attack on Sari Bair from Suvla Bay broke down.  Thefall of Constantinople  seemed indefinitely postponed.  The  risks to  which theArabs would be exposed if they openly revolted were obviously increased.  Therewas consequently a change of tone in the Sherif&apos;s second letter to Sir H. McMahon,written on  the 9th September :          &apos;&apos;  Your Excellency will pardon me and permit me to  say clearly that the    coolness and hesitation displayed in the question of the limits and boundaries    ....  might be taken to infer an estrangement or something of that sort.&apos;&apos;About the same time  as Sir H. McMahon received this letter he  was also informed of conversations which had been carried on with a representative of the syrian Nationalist Committee, who  made it clear that the Arabs&apos;  choice betweenthe Central Powers and the Allies would be determined by the nature of Britishassurances  as  to their future independence.   He asserted&apos;that,  while the Arabswanted all the Arab countries to  be free, they admitted the existence of Britishinterests in Iraq and French interests on  the Syrian coast.   They would insist,however, on the independence of the Syrian interior the districts of Damascus,Aleppo, Hama and Horns.   Sir H. McMahon communicated this information,together with  the Sherifs letter,  to Sir Edward Grey at the  Foreign  Office, andhe was authorised to reply to the Sherif on  the lines he (Sir Henry McMahon) had
himself suggested. On the 24th October, accordingly, he wrote the following letterto the Sherif :-         &quot; I have  received  your letter  [of the  9th  September]  with  much    pleasure; and your expressions of sincerity and  friendliness have given me    the greatest satisfaction.         &quot;I regret  that you  should have  received  from  my  last letter  the    impression thatT regarded the question of the boundaries with coldness and    hesitation;  such was not the case, but it  appeared to me the moment had not    arrived when they could be profitably discussed.         &quot; I have realized,  however, from your last letter that you regard this    question as one of vital and urgent importance.   I  have therefore lost no    time in informing the Government of Great Britain of the contents of your    letter;  and it  is with  great pleasure that I communicate to you on their    behalf the following statement,  which, I am confident, you will receive with    satisfaction :-         &quot; The districts of Mersina  and Alexandretta and the portions of Syria    lying to the west of the districts  of Damascus,  Horns,  Hama and Aleppo    cannot be said to be purely Arab, and should be excluded from the proposed    limits and boundaries.  With the above modification, and without prejudice    to  our  existing  treaties with  Arab  chiefs,   we accept  these limits and    boundaries, and  in regard to those portions  of the  territories therein  in    which Great Britain is free  to act without detriment to the interests of her    ally, France, I  am empowered  in the  name  of  the Government of  Great    Britain to give the following  assurances and make the following reply to your    letter :          &quot; Subject  to the above  modifications, Great  Britain is prepared  to    recognize and support the independence of the Arabs within the territories    included in the limits and boundaries proposed by  the Sherif of Mecca.  Great    Britain will guarantee  the Holy Places  against all external aggression and    will recognize their inviolability.         &quot; When the situation  admits, Great Britain will give to the Arabs her    advice and will  assist  them to  establish what may appear to be  the most    suitable  forms of government in those various territories.         &quot; On the other hand,  it is  understood that  the Arabs have decided to    seek the advice and guidance of Great Britain only, and that such European    Advisers and officials as may be required for the  formation of a sound form    of administration will be British.         &quot; With regard to  the vilayets of Bagdad and  Basra, the Arabs will    recognize that  the established  position and interests  of  Great  Britain    necessitate special measures of administrative  control in order to secure these    territories from  foreign  aggression, to promote the welfare of the local    population and to safeguard our mutual economic  interests.         &apos;&apos; I am convinced that this declaration will assure you beyond all possible    doubts of the sympathy of  Great Britain  towards the aspirations of  her    traditional friends, the Arabs, and will result in  a firm and lasting alliance,    the immediate results of which  will be the expulsion of the Turks  from the    Arab countries and the freeing  of the Arab peoples from the Turkish yoke    which, for so many years,  has pressed heavily upon them.....&quot;Of the  passages we  have italicized, the second is  significant in relation to theclaim which had been made by the French  Government in  March  1915 to theultimate control of all Syria, including Palestine.   But it is  the first passage onwhich the subsequent controversy has centred.    6.   The map on the  opposite  page shows that under Turkish  rule  theterritory under discussion  was  divided into three  administrative  areas,  theVilayets of Aleppo, Syria and Beirut.  The Vilayet of Syria extended south-wards  to include the area  now  called  Trans-Jordan.   The Vilayet of Beirutextended southwards  to within a short distance of Jaffa.  The rest of Palestine,including Jerusalem, was  not  included in any  of  the  Vilayets : it  was an&quot; independent Sanjak.&quot;    7.   The Arab case, which  was fully stated in the evidence submitted to us by the Arab  Higher Committee, has always been that Palestine was included inthe area in which Sir H.  McMahon  promised that Arab independence would be
                                                                          9 Q                                                                          *i 5                                     7recognized.  The two main points are (1) that, since part of the western boundary of the independent  area  proposed by the Sherif was  the  Mediterranean, the exclusion of the whole of the coast from that area could not have been intended,and (2) that Damascus was the most southerly point mentioned and that Palestinecould not be regarded as lying to the west of it.    8.  We have  not  considered  that  our terms of reference required us toundertake the detailed  and lengthy research among the documents of twenty years ago which would  be needed  for a full re-examination of this issue.  Wethink it sufficient for  the purposes of this Report  to  state that  the  BritishGovernment has never  accepted the  Arab case.  When it was first formallypresented by the Arab Delegation in London in 1922, the Secretary of State forthe Colonies (Mr.  Churchill) replied as follows:         &quot; That letter  [Sir H. McMahon&apos;s letter of the 24th  October, 1915] is    quoted as conveying the promise to the Sherif  of Mecca to recognize and    support the independence of the Arabs within  the  territories  proposed by    him.  But this promise was given subject to a reservation  made  in the same    letter, which excluded from its scope,  among other territories,  the portions    of Syria lying to the west of the district of Damascus.  This reservation has    always been regarded by His Majesty&apos;s Government as  covering the vilayet    of Beirut and  the independent Sanjak of Jerusalem.  The whole of Palestine    west of the Jordan  was thus excluded from Sir H. McMahon&apos;s pledge.&quot;    9.  It was in  the highest  degree unfortunate that, in the exigencies of war,the British Government was unable to make their intention clear to the Sherif.Palestine,  it  will  have been noticed, was  not expressly mentioned in  Sir  H.McMahon&apos;s letter of the 24th  October, 1915.  Nor was any later reference madeto it.   In the further correspondence between Sir H. McMahon and the Sherif,the only areas relevant to  the present discussion which were mentioned were theVilayets of Aleppo and Beirut.  The Sherif asserted that  these Vilayets werepurely Arab; and, when Sir H. McMahon pointed out that French interests were involved, he replied that, while he did not recede from his full claims in the north,he did not wish to  injure the alliance between Britain and France, and would not ask &quot; for what we now leave to France in  Beirut and its coasts &quot; till after theWar.  There was no more bargaining over boundaries.  It only remained for theBritish G-overnment to supply the Sherif with the  50,000 in gold per month andthe rifles, ammunition and foodstuffs he required for launching and sustaining therevolt.    10. Meantime,  the  French interest  in  Syria had been reaffirmed.   InNovember  1915, shortly after Sir H. McMahon had  given his  &quot; pledge &quot; to theSherif,  Sir Edward Grey had  given instructions that  negotiations should be opened in  London with M. Georges Picot, representing the French  Government,with a view to reconciling British,  French  and Arab claims in the  Syrian area.M. Picot insisted  at the outset  that the whole of Syria down to the Egyptianfrontier must be assigned to France.  After consultation with his Government, he agreed to the Syrian interior being administered by Arabs under French influence.Further negotiations were carried  on  by M. Picot  and  Sir Mark  Sykes, whoconsulted the Russian  Government.   Finally, in May 1916, an agreement was concluded, commonly known as the Sykes-Picot Arrangement, which divided theArab area north of the Arabian Peninsula in the following manner :     (1) A coastal belt from a little north of Haifa to a little west of  Mersina was          to be controlled by France.    (2) Southern  Iraq, from  the  Persian Gulf  to  a little north  of Bagdad,          together with a small enclave round  Haifa, was to be controlled by          Britain.    (3) &quot; With a view to  securing the religious interests of  the Entente Powers,          Palestine, with the Holy Places, is  to be separated  from Turkish          territory and subjected to a special regime to be determined by agree-          ment between Russia, France and Great Britain.&quot;    (4) The rest of the territory under discussion was left  to &quot; the Arab State          or Confederation of States.&quot;  In the Syrian interior such advice and          administrative assistance as were wanted by the Arabs would be          supplied  by  France,  in Northern Iraq and the  country  east  of the          Jordan by Britain.
    11.  This agreement  was kept secret till  in  November 1917 the RussianBolshevik Government published a copy of it, found in the archives of the ForeignOffice at Petrograd.   It was thus in  ignorance of any  other compact than the&quot;McMahon Pledge&quot; that in July 1916  the Sherif  declared war against theTurks.  The story of the Arab Revolt is too familiar from the fame and writingsof T. E. Lawrence to need re-telling.   Its main features may be summarised asfollows :  By the end of 1916 the  Arabs of the Ffejaz had  easily overcome theisolated Turkish posts in the south of their country, but they  were unable todislodge the garrison at Medina, which was linked by the Hejaz railway with themain Turkish forces in the North.  During 1917 the Turkish posts along the linewere continually raided, and stretches of the railway repeatedly destroyed.  when a British army invaded Palestine in the autumn of 1917, the Arabs, a few thousand of whom had been trained as a regular force, operated beyond the Jordanon the outer flank of the advance.  Their co-operation was unquestionably a factor in the success of the campaign which culminated in the capture of Jerusalem onthe 9th December, 1917, and in the final  expulsion of the Turkish forces  from palestine in  the following autumn.   The open revolt of the Sherif, moreover,had a marked effect on the wavering sympathies of other Arab tribes than thoseof the Hejaz.    12.  It was the Sherif&apos;s own people, however, who bore the brunt of the actualfighting.  The  Arabs of  Palestine did  not rise  against the  Turks, and the palestinian conscripts continued fighting in the Turkish army.   But it must beremembered that to revolt  in the desert was far easier  than to revolt in a countrystill   in  Turkish hands  and subject, as  the  British  invasion proceeded,  toincreasingly rigorous treatment.  As it was, the Turks were seriously embarrased by their inability to count on the loyalty of the population; and within their linesthe Syrian nationalists were engaged  in active sedition, for  which some of  thempaid the price on the gallows.
