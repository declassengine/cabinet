2 -  i. The Royal Commission on the Private Manufacture of and trading in Arms; was appointed in February, 1935,  and signedits Report (Cmd. 5292) on September 24th, 1936.  The report has received the careful consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment,  and the conclusions  which they have reached on  thesubject are set out in the following paragraphs.  2. The first, and main, question which the Royal commission was asked to consider and report upon was    &apos;&apos;  the practicability and  desirability (both from the national    and international point of view) of the adoption (a) by the    United  Kingdom alone, (&amp;) by  the  United Kingdom in    conjunction  with other  countries of the  world,  of a pro-    hibition of private manufacture of and trade. in arms and    munitions of war, and the institution  of a State monopoly    of such manufacture and trade &quot;.  3. This question was  elaborately examined by the Commis-sion, with the help of a large body of evidence both oral andwritten, and the unanimous conclusion of the Commissionersthrows a  great deal of light on a difficult  subject on  which public  opinion  has hitherto  largely  lacked  impartial andauthorative  guidance.  As regards the international  aspects ofthe problem of  State  monopoly, the Commission  point  out(paragraph 41) that     &quot;  as to the, practicability of establishing by international    agreement a universal  system of State  monopoly of the    manufacture of arms there is little that can usefully.be said.    In a sense it would no doubt be practicable if all the States    of the world agreed to adopt it in principle and were willing    and  competent to enforce it within their own borders &quot;.  4. The  Commissioners  go on  to  point out,  however, thatprotracted efforts in this direction from  1920  onwards, have ledto little practical result, and  they continue        43.  &quot; Apart from the  question of practicability, however,    wd do not consider that a change to a system of universal    State monopoly of the  manufacture  of  arms is desirable    whilst the present international  situation obtains.   We do    not think that the  establishment of such a  system  would    entirely remove the objection which is entertained to mak-    ing a profit out of the  trade.  It is,  we think,  difficult to    assume that producing  governmemnts would be prepared    to supply arms to non-producing governments at cost price.    The profit under such a system might go to the tax-payer    instead of to the individual, but  the  inducement  would
3    remain.  It is conceded that  the non-producing  countries    are entitled to a supply of arms and  munitions of war for    the perfectly legitimate purposes of self-defence, the  main-    tenance  of order,  and  the  fulfilment  of international    obligations, and that if  all sources of private  supply are    cut off, a non-producing country must either start its own    maunfactories or&apos; purchase from some  producing country &apos;&apos;.      44. &quot; The conclusion  at which we  have arrived on this    point is  that  in the  present  state  of international  affairs    the setting up of a universal  system  of State monopoly  is    unlikely  either to reduce the available supply of arms and    munitions of war, or to  increase  the  prospect of a general    peace &quot;.      45. &quot; We are  accordingly  unable  to  recommend that,    present conditions obtain, the promotion of general State    monopoly should be  accepted  as  part of  the international    policy of this country.&quot;  5. His Majesty&apos;s Government accept these Conclusions.  TheCommission points out that even if the setting up of a universalsystem of State monopoly could be  practically achieved, it wouldbe unlikely either to  reduce the available supply of arms and munitions of war or to increase the prospect  of general  peace.In the view  of the Commission, therefore, the  main purposes for which such a policy has been advocated in certain quarterscould not be achieved by its adoption, and His  Majesty&apos;s Gov-ernment feel that the reasoning  and  the conclusions  of theCommission on this matter cannot be resisted.  6. The Commissioners next set themselves to consider theproblem of State monopoly in the  United  Kingdom  in theabsence  of international agreement.  The Report discusses  in turn the moral and humanitarian considerations put forward  insupport of a State monopoly (paragraphs  51 to 56), the sugges-tion that the existence of a private  trade in arms has  a realinfluence upon  issues of  peace  and war (paragraphs 57 to 63),the  relative  practical advantages and  disdvantages  inherent in a system of State monopoly of the manufacture of and tradein arms, and the importance to be attached to the continuanceof private industry from the point of view of Imperial defence(paragraphs  64 to 85).   It appears to  the Government  that itcannot be disputed that the decision as to unilateral State mon-opoly must be  governed by these  four criteria, and each of thefour is passed in review by the Report of  the Commission.  7. If the Report is examined, it will be seen with how muchcare and thoroughness (these different considerations have beenweighed, and the  unanimous conclusion  of the  Commissionersis as folows:        &quot; We  thus  reach the conclusion that, when  judged by     reference to the four criteria  which we regard as relevant,
4    the proposal to prohibit (the  private manufacture of and    trade in arms  in this country,  and to substitute for it a    State monopoly is unacceptable &quot;.  8. His Majesty&apos;s Government accept this conclusion, whichcorresponds with the views which they have been led to form inthe light of their practical experience of providing the organisa-tion of defence preparations.  It is necessary to study the rele-vant  paragraphs of the  Commission^ Report in extenso to appreciate the full force of the reasoning which leads the Com-missioners unanimously to that conclusion.   But attention isparticularly directed to the considerations set out in the Reportbearing upon the possibilities of rapid expansion in the case ofgreat national emergency or the breaking out of war.  The Com-.missioners point out that  private armament manufacturers  are able,  by utilising their plant and their employees on alternative work when  Government orders are  not available,  to  maintainthe reserve of equipment and labour  which is invaluable to thecountry on an outbreak of war.  The maintenance by the Stateof factories  on a scale sufficient to meet such fluctuations and demand would be  wasteful and  costly.  Reserve plant main-tained by the State would need constant renewal if it were notto become obsolete.  In conditions of modern warfare, the need of the country on the outbreak of war is for a system whichensures the most rapid and effective mobilisation of the whole ofour industrial resources.   Neither State enterprise nor private industry can alone secure the  position. It can only be secured by the utilisation  of  both and by the greatest  measure  of collaboration between the State and private industry in peace-time.  Moreover,  if the utilisation of private industry for themanufacture of arms in peace-time  were discontinued and thewhole of the Governments peace-time requirements were to be manufactured in  Government establishments,  the  amount of plant and equipment available for the expansion of productionin the eventuality of war, and the  personnel of all kinds ex-ineperienced in the use of that  plant  and equipment,  would bevery  materially diminished.  If it be assumed that in the eventof a major  war the conscription to the Governments needs ofall the industrial capacity of the country may become necessary,&quot;it is beyond question,&quot; say the Commissioners, &quot; that theproper utilisation in war-time of the  resources of the country&apos;private industry will not be achieved unless  it  is  fully and efficiently planned and organised in advance in peace-time.There is all the difference in the world between this preparation for war emergency during peace,  followed by the general con-scription of industry when the  crisis arrives, and a policy of nationalisation in  anticipation of the crisis.   Indeed the situa-tion requires, in  our opinion,  as a specific  condition of thesuccessful employment in emergency of the general industry of the country, that the  plant and  personnel of that industry
5should be required to co-operate in large measure in the supplyof armaments during peace.&quot;  9. The Government see no  escape  from these conclusions,supported  as  they  are by a converging series of convincingarguments, and confirmed by current experiences.  accordingly the Government accept the conclusion of the Report that       &quot; The abolition of the private  industry in the  United    Kingdom and the substitution for it of a  system of State    monopoly may be practicable; but  it  is undesirable.  No    sufficient case has in our opinion been made out for taking    so drastic a step.  We believe that the reasons for maintain-    ing the private industry outweigh those for its abolition.    We are of opinion that the necessities  of Imperial defence    cannot be effectively met, in existing conditions, except by    the maintenance in peace-time of a system  of collaboration    between the  Government and the private  industry of the    country in the supply of arms and munitions.&quot;  10. The  Report of the  Commission  then proceeds  (para-graph 90 et seq.) to deal with  the second question referred tothem, viz.     &quot; whether there are any  steps which can usefully be taken    to remove or minimize the kinds of objections to which    private manufacture is  stated  in  Article  8 (5)   of  the    Covenant of the League of Nations to be open.&quot;The Commissioners  in an earlier paragraph  (paragraph  17)pointed  out that neither the terms of  reference nor the  article of theCovenant referred to identify, or attempt to indicate whatthese alleged objections are; indeed, the Commission has taken the  view that it was  not only not  directed to ascertain whatthe  objections are, but was not required to form any  opinon as to the weight which should be attached to them if they wereascertained.  But as remedies can only be intelligently formu-lated if the nature of these alleged objections has first, by some means,  been ascertained, the only course open to  the  Corn-mission  appeared to be to ascertain what objections had alreadybeen formulated at Geneva  in  consequence of  Article 8 (5) ofthe  Covenant and to invite  expressions of opinion  as  to theexistence of  &quot; objections and  attendant evils  &quot;  and to treatthese as the objections and attendant evils to which their mindsshould be  directed, without necessarily passing any judgmentupon them.  His Majesty&apos;s  Government fully appreciate thereasons  which led the Commission to take this course, but theymust take  leave  to point out that  the weight to be attachedto recommendations  as to any steps which might be taken toremove   or minimise objections  is  necessarily  very   muchaffected by the circumstances that the Commission has not felt it right  to  pronounce as to the validity  or importance  of theobjections which have been suggested.
5should be required to co-operate in large measure in the supplyof armaments during peace.&quot;  9. The Government see no  escape  from these conclusions,supported as  they  are  by a  converging series of convincingarguments, and confirmed by current experiences.  accordingly the Government accept the conclusion of the Report that        &quot; The abolition of the private  industry in the United    Kingdom and the substitution for it of a  system of State    monopoly may be practicable; but  it is undesirable.  No    sufficient case has in our opinion been made out for taking    so drastic a step.  We believe that the reasons for maintain-    ing the private industry outweigh those for its abolition.    We are of opinion that the necessities of Imperial defence    cannot be effectively met, in existing conditions, except by    the maintenance in  peace-time of a system  of collaboration    between  the  Government  and the private  industry of the    country in the supply of arms and munitions.&quot;  10. The  Report of the  Commission  then  proceeds (para-graph 90 et seq.) to deal with  the second  question referred tothem, viz.     &quot; whether there are any steps which can usefully be taken    to remove or minimize the kinds of  objections  to which    private  manufacture  is  stated  in  Article 8  (5)  of  the    Covenant of the League of Nations to be open.&quot;The Commissioners  in  an earlier paragraph  (paragraph  17)pointed out that neither the terms of reference nor the article of the Covenant referred to identify, or attempt  to indicate whatthese alleged objections are; indeed, the Commission has taken the view that it was not  only not  directed to ascertain whatthe objections are, but was not required to form any opinon as to the weight which should be attached to them if they wereascertained.   But as remedies can only be intelligentiy formu-lated if the nature of these alleged objections has first, by some means,  been ascertained, the only course open to the Corn-mission appeared to be to ascertain what objections had alreadybeen formulated at Geneva in  consequence of  Article 8  (5) ofthe Covenant and to invite expressions of opinion as to theexistence of  &quot; objections  and  attendant evils  &quot;  and  to treatthese as the objections and attendant evils to which their mindsshould be directed, without necessarily passing any judgmentupon  them.  His Majesty&apos;s Government fully, appreciate  thereasons which led the Commission to take this course, but theymust  take  leave  to point out that  the weight to be attachedto recommendations  as  to any steps which might be taken toremove  or  minimise  objections  is  necessarily  very  muchaffected by the circumstances that the Commission  has not felt it right to pronounce as to the validity or importance of theobjections which have been suggested.
6  II.  The  above observations gain greatly in strength by  acircumstance,  hitherto little  understood,  to  which  the  Com-missioners  draw express attention.   The Report  of the FirstSub-Committee of the Temporary Mixed  Commission of  theLeague of  Nations of September, 1921,  contains a list of  the alleged objections to untramelled private  manufacture undersix heads,  which are set out in paragraph 92 of the Commis-sion&apos;s  Report.   It has  been  very widely supposed that  this list of  objections should be regarded  as authoritative evidenceby  the Geneva Sub-Committee after  full investigation  andenquiry.  Indeed, the list is not infrequently quoted as thoughit amounted to  a finding of conclusions by the Sub-Committee,and opponents  of the system of private manufacture  of armshave frequentiy relied upon the list  as  representing the con-sidered judgment of the body specially appointed by the Leagueof Nations to investigate the  matter.  Nothing of the sort everhappened.   The Sub-Committee of the League never investi-gated the question of whether the evils, suggested in  this listof objections, existed.  They never heard evidence on  the sub-ject and they certainly never  pronounced any conclusion on theevidence.   What the Sub-Committee did was merely  to draw up a  list  of &quot;  objections  that were raised at the time to  un-tramelled  private manufacture &quot; (paragraph 93), just as  ina subsequent  passage,  they  made a list of arguments  whichmight  be urged in  favour of preserving private manufacture.It is,  therefore, as the  Report of the Commission points  out,a complete mistake to suppose that the list of alleged objectionshas  behind it  the  authority of any investigation  or of  anyenquiry.   The list is a list of criticisms that had been formu-lated,  not of  conclusions that have  been  arrived at.   It  is  apleading and not a verdict.  12.  Having thus explained that the Report of the Sub-Com-mittee of 1921 reached no conclusion as to the validity or im-portance  of any of the alleged objections, the Commissionersproceeded to deal with the matter as far  as they could in thelight of evidence submitted to them.  Insofar as alleged objec-tions are founded on the conduct of foreign firms, the Corn-mission point out that  they  have no means of  forming a  con-clusion.       &quot; If such objections  are well founded  in the case of     foreign firms, the only possible  remedy, in the absence of     international agreement  is for the Government within whose     jurisdiction the offences are committed to deal with them.&quot;     (Paragraph 93.)   13.  The Report  goes  on  to make  some  comment on the evidence submitted to  the  Commission in regard to  the  evils that are alleged to exist, so far as the United Kingdom manu- facturers  are concerned, and deductions are drawn from that evidence.   The Report states that 
                             7       &apos;&apos; So far as United Kingdom manufacturers are concerned    the charges  are few and the evidence scanty.&quot;It is not on specific charges that the case has been mainly based,but rather on general allegations as to the operation of ordinary business methods and the  effect of ordinary business considera-tions in a trade which profits from international tension.  (Para-graph  95.)       ...  14.  The  following extracts from  the Report show  the view taken by the Commission on various heads of allegation:      (Paragraph  98.)       &quot; We are not persuaded on the evidence given before us    that British armament firms are guilty of having been active    in fomenting war  scares or of  persuading this country to    adopt  warlike policies and to increase its armaments.&quot;    (Paragraph  99.)       &quot; We  do  not believe the  armament firms  attempt the    bribery of  government  officials  in  this  country.  As to    bribery abroad we have not sought, nor in fact were  we    in a position to seek, evidence as to the extent  to which    it  is resorted to.&quot;    (Paragraph 103.)       &quot; No evidence  has  been laid before us  which we regard    as supporting  the charges that armament firms in  this    country have sought  to influence public  opinion  through    the control  of the press.&quot;    (Paragraph 104.)       &quot; So far  as the charges of nefarious  and underground    activities on the part of manufacturers in  the United King-    dom, in connection with price raising and other rings, are    concerned we  do not  consider  that  such charges have    been established upon the evidence before us.&quot;The above general conclusions must be read in the light of anincident which occurred many years ago and which is discussed in detail in Appendix V to the Report.  (Page 100.)  15.  It remains to deal with certain specific recommendations which  are made by the Commission in a later portion of itsReport.    First, as to the acceptance  of appointments  witharmament  firms by public officials  on the termination of  their government service.  The Commission say        &quot; We have no reason to believe, and do not believe,  that    the practice in question has been, or is  likely to be,  the    occasion of  any weakening of departmental independence;    it  is a practice which has obvious advantages in a system    under which armament firms are free to recruit ex-officials    industry,  and we  do  not propose that it should be discon-    tinued&quot;:  (Paragraph 109).
But the Commisioners go on to say        &quot; We cannot, however, regard as satisfactory the position    under which armament firms are free to recruit ex-officials    and ex-officers of the Army, Navy and Air Force at their    own discretion, and we cannot ignore the suspicions  which    arise  from the practice, however, ill-founded they may be.    We therefore recommend that officers, whether serving or    retired, should not enter the service  of armament firms    in any capacity without the specific approval of the Minister    fn charge of their department.&quot; (Paragraph no).His Majesty&apos;s Government take note of this suggestion, but whenit is analysed it will be found to raise difficult questions such asthe definition  of an &quot; armament firm &quot;, the promotion  of ex-officials from a non-armament to an  armament branch of a firm,  e.g. in the &quot;shadow  industry&quot;;  the acceptance  of an appointment to a better position in  a  firm which is not solelydevoted to armament manufacture; the case of an ex-officialwhose Government service  was of a temporary character, e.g.in the Great War; the &quot; sanction &quot; for neglect of the rule, par-ticularly in the case of ex-officials who have no pension whichcould be  forfeited.  The matter is indeed a branch of a much wider question, not by any means confined to  the armaments industry, viz.  the question of the acceptance of appointmentsby officers of  the Crown Services on the termination of their government service.  This larger question calls for careful study and is not being overlooked.   16. The second  of the specific recommendations  made bythe Commissioners deals  with the question of the international control of the trade  in arms.   In this connexion the Com-missioners have examined  the draft articles for the regulation and  control of arms  manufacture and trade submitted  to  the bureau of the  Disarmament Conference in November 1934 and considered by the  Arms Committee of  the  Conference  in  theearly part of 1935.   They  review the  attitude  assumed  by theGovernment towards  these proposals, the difficulties in the wayof  their complete acceptance and the modifications suggested bythe Government.  Finally they say:         &apos;&apos;  We believe that the principles that lie behind the  United     States Draft Articles command  a wide measure of support     abroad, and that the Draft Articles afford a basis on which     an agreement for the international regulation and control of     the trade in arms might be reached. We recognise that the     realisation of these proposals would be of less value than an     international agreement for the limitation of arms, and that     they involve  restrictions that may be unwelcome or may     be thought to be excessive for the limited purposes in view.     But  we nevertheless think that the possibility should not be     missed of securing international agreement in the domain     of arms control even on a limited scale.&quot; (Paragraph 176).
9  17. The promotion and  encouragement of measures for theinternational regulation of the manufacture of and trade in armshave long formed part of  the policy of this country.  It is apolicy, however, which must be pursued with certain difficultiesin mind.  For example, due regard must, as enjoined in Article8 (5) of the League Covenant, be had to &quot; the necessities of those members  of the League which are not able to  manufacture the munitions and implements  of war necessary for their safety &quot;.  18. As regards the U.S. draft proposals, the Government are,as is appreciated by the Commissioners, in full sympathy withthe principles  on which these  proposals  are based and havealready accepted  them as  a basis for  discussion.  It is in themethod of giving effect to  certain of these principles that diffi-culties arise.   The amendments put forward by the Governmentare of a practical nature  and designed to make the proposed convention more appropriate to its purpose and more generally acceptable.  They adhere to the  view that  their amendments,which are summarised in paragraphs 121 to 124 of the RoyalCommission^  Report, satisfactorily achieve these aims.  19. At the present moment international  political conditionsare such that  no immediate hope  can be entertained of making any progress  towards international  limitation  or reduction ofarmaments.  It is the main object of the Governments foreignpolicy so  to improve the international political situation as toprovide conditions in which such  progress will be possible.   Inthe meantime  they are not  entirely convinced of the  desirabilityof pressing forward with any isolated aspect of the  armamentsproblem.   Nevertheless, they  consider that  the question  ofthe publicity of national defence expenditure might be examined and the possibility explored of attaining general agreement  onthe Draft Convention on this subject drawn up by  the oompe-tent sub-committee of the Disarmament Conference.  They areprepared  to accept this Convention and  to enforce it if it  is accepted by the principal Powers.   The Government regard this draft Convention as something in the nature  of a  touchstone.Should general agreement be reached on it, the  re-considerationof the wider  question of  the international regulation  of armsmanufacture and  trade should be  possible.   Should  no progressbe  made, even on  these  mode9t proposals  for publicity ofnational defence expenditure, no  useful purpose could  possibly be served at present by re-opening the wider question.  20. Chapter VIII of the Royal Commission^ Report dealswith  the  question of  Government  regulation  and  control ofprivate industry, and the Commissioners&apos;  conclusion on  thissubject is summarised in Chapter  XII,  paragraph 6,  as follows:       &quot; We recommend that the Government  should assume     complete  responsibility for the arms industry in the United     Kingdom and should  organise and regulate the necessary
10    collaboration  between  the  Government  and private in-    dustry; that this responsibility should be exercised through    a controlling body, presided over by a Minister responsible    to Parliament, having executive powers in peace-time and in    war-time, over all matters relating to the supply and manu-    facture of arms and munitions, costing and the authorisation    of orders from abroad.   .   &quot;We  further recommend, that the Governmenfs  own    manufacturing establishments should be fully equipped for    the production in some measures of Naval, Military and Air    armaments of all types.&quot;The Commissioners states that many interesting and construc-tive proposals have been made by certain witnesses in regard tothe machinery for the control proposed in the first part of these recommendations and they  accordingly refrain from reportingin detail on that aspect of  the matter.  The evidence referred tohas been studied by His Majesty&apos;s Government but they regretto say that they do not find in it any solution of the practicaldifficulties which would beset such a control, if established inpeace conditions.  The first part of the recommendation involves the establish-ment  in peace of  an  executive  Minister and  Ministry to  takeover from  the three Service Departments the whole  of  their work of munitions supply.  In Chapter VIII of the Royal Commission^ Report the objects of the new Minister and Ministry  are defined as being:        (i) to ensure rapidity of expansion in emergency periods;      (ii) to check prices and establish a planning system in    peace time conditions;      (iii) to prevent the  possibility of profiteering in time of    war or  national emergency, and thereby to  eliminate the    incentive to those grave objections  to which the system of    private  manufacture is open.  In so far as the checking of  prices  in peace is concerned,reference to this matter will be  found below in the comments on the  recommendations  based  on Chapter  IX of the RoyalCommission^ Report.  The prevention of profiteering in war isonly one  aspect of the large question  of the relations to beestablished in war between the state and industry and it is being studied  in connection with the question of control of industry inwar (see paragraph 25).  The remainder of the Commissioners&apos; case for the establish-ment  of a single Executive Minister and Ministry of Supply inpeace is that this course is essential to proper planning for war conditions and to expansion  to meet war needs.  The questionof a single Executive Minister and Ministry of Supply in peace is one which was carefully considered by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in 1926 when the problem  was remitted to the Committee
IIwhose terms of reference, for the present purposes, were (Cmd.2649 of 1926):       &quot; To make definite proposals for the amalgamation, or,    if this appears impossible or undesirable, for the co-ordina-    tion  as far  as possible of the Supply  Departments in the    Service Ministries.&quot;The Committee, however, reported  (Cmd. 2649 of 1926) &quot; thatno steps should  be  taken to bring about either  complete  or partial amalgamation of the Supply Branches  of the three fighting  Services or of any section &quot;of those Branches.&quot;  TheGovernment accordingly decided that a single Ministry of supply in peace  was not required in the public interest.  This decisioncarried with it the corollary that the executive responsibility for preparing for supply in war must also remain with the service department, but it was felt that strong co-ordinating machinery was  necessary, and, in view of the importance of the issues,that this machinery should be established under the aegis of theCommittee of Imperial Defence.  The Principal Supply OfficersCommittee, with its subsidiary bodies, was, therefore, set upas a  Sub-Committee  of Committee of  Imperial Defence, andthis organisation has been occupied for several years in con-sidering the war needs of supply on bases given to it by theCommittee of Imperial Defence, and in framing plans to  meet them, and especially plans for war  adaptation and war expan-sion in certain branches of industry.  21. Further developments of this  organisation in recent years have  been made by:      (a) the appointment of a whole-time Chairman and Secre-    tary, Supply Board  and whole-time  Chairman of some    Supply Committees;      (0) the appointment of a Minister for Co-ordination of    Defence,, who, as Chairman of the Principal Supply Officers    Committee, has Cabinet and Parliamentary responsibility    for the whole work of the organisation as above described.At the same time various improvements  have been made inthe internal supply organisation of  the Service Departments, as for example, in the War Office by the concentration of muni-tions supply in the hands of the Director General of munitions production with  a seat on the Army Council, and in the AirMinistry  by the appointment of a Director of Production.   22. His  Majesty&apos;s Government  believe  that  the  needs ofthe case  are adequately met by the arrangements above out-lined and that there is no present case on merits for the radical change  suggested.   It is further to  be remembered that thewhole organisation is at present working at very high  pressure on the Defence Programme, and that  sweeping changes in itmust delay progress and could only be justified by the strongest
12grounds of public interest which His Majesty&apos;s Government, asat present advised, are unable to discover.  The above observations, it should be added, have referenceto supply organisation in peace.  The question of supply organi-sation in war conditions raises different issues and is at present under careful consideration.  23. The Commissioners say: (See also paragraph 20.)       &quot; We  further recommend that  the Governmenfs  own    manufacturing establishments should be fully equipped for    the production in some measure of naval, military and air    armaments of all types &quot;.  This recommendation  is expressed at  greater length in thelatter part of paragraph 130, at the end of Chapter VIII, and isadvanced by the Commission as a means of planning for rapid expansion in emergency, checking of trade prices in peace, andelimination  of risk of profiteering  in war.   A further reasongiven  for  this recommendation  is  that  it would strengthennational defence if international limitation of  arms resulted inthe trade  restricting or abandoning its present range of manu-facture (end of paragraph 130).   His Majesty&apos;s Government  desire to draw attention to thefact that  this recommendation is already met to  a very con-siderable  extent by  the existing organisation.  For example,the Royal Dockyards are capable  of building warships of all types and the Royal Ordnance Factories and other government establishments are capable of supplying in some measure avery  large proportion of  the different types of arms in use inthe Army and Navy.  They feel, however, that if the recommendation is examineda little more closely, it  will be seen that the reasons advancedfor putting it forward are by no means conclusive.  The chiefreason given is planning for  rapid expansion in  emergency.Recent experience shows, however, that  this object can  onlybe achieved by equipping a large number of private firms withthe necessary plant, tools, jigs, and gauges as part of a plan for industrial mobilisation, in addition  to the resources ofGovernment Establishments.   It must be remembered that agreat many items which would be  required in large quantitiesin time of war are closely related from the manufacturing pointof view  to  similar articles made by private  firms in time ofpeace, and  in such cases it is obviously  advantageous to  drawupon  the large body of experience  and  capacity for outputwhich such firms  provide.  This  aspect  of the question has,indeed, been forcefully set out by the Commissioners in ChapterV of their report, to which allusion is made in paragraph  8 oftheir present White Paper.   Another reason put forward for  this recommendation is that state manufacture would furnish a check on the prices charged
13 by private firms and thus tend to eliminate the risk of profiteer- ing.  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government recognise  the  value cf the check obtained in this way through the operations of the Eoyal Dockyards and the Royal Ordnance Factories; but they desire to  point  out that  modern accounting and technical costing methods which are being  widely  and increasingly applied to Government  contracts have made  it possible to obtain  other checks  of  at least  equal efficiency  for the  purpose  in  view. The setting up of additional state  manufacture purely for this purpose, would, in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, not be  justified.  An important difficulty in the way of  the adoption of  this recommendation  is that it would  in many cases lead to  un- necessary duplication  of plant and thus to wasteful expenditure in  capital  outlay and maintenance  on the part of the  State and uneconomical production on the part of the private firms. For example, armour and heavy Naval gun mountings require plant, a proportion of  which  is capable  of use  both for the manufacture  of arms  and for commercial work.  The existing practice whereby these  products are manufactured by private firms enables the same plant to be  used for both purposes. If the State decided to  set up  separate establishments for the armament work alone, the maintenance of the increased number of  plants  would  mean  that the overhead costs,  both for the State and for private industry,  would be  considerably greater than they are at present.  As regards aircraft, the stage of progress of the industry is a fundamental  reason  against manufacture  of machines  and engines in Government  factories. Such manufacture would in- inevitably tend  to premature standardisation  of  types in an industry of which the  essential characteristic at  present, and probably for a considerable time to come,  is  rapid development and  improvement, sometimes  of  an almost   revolutionary character.  The strongest possible  competition in  design in- spired by the best brains working under conditions most favour- able to  and provocative of invention and progress is essential to the maintenance of  the highest level of efficiency.  Moreover, the great number and variety  of types of aircraft engines and equipment now being manufactured by private firms make the adoption of this particular recommendation a physical impossi-bility.  The position  of His Majesty&apos;s  Government is, therefore, that whilst they are  not opposed in principle to extending the range of  Government  manufacture   in  appropriate instances,  the question is one  which  must be considered on the merits of  eachcase, with due regard  to economy and in the light of the many complex factors which  should  be  taken into account in  con-nection  with planning for large  scale production in emergency.
14  24. Chapter IX of the Report deals with the question of the regulation of profit on the manufacture of armaments.   TheCommission refer to the conception &quot;  that war and preparation for war ought not to be the occasion of private gain &quot;, and ex-press the view that public feeling on this matter, as being wide-spread, intense  and genuine, ought not to be ignored.  They goon to say: &quot; The complete removal  of the profit motive from private industry  . .  . is, in our opinion neither necessary  nordesirable. .  . .   But it is our opinion that measures ought to betaken to restrict the profits of armament firms in peace-time to areasonable scale of remuneration.&quot;  (It is to be assumed, having regard  to the views expressed bythe Commission as to the necessity  for broadening the basis ofmunitions manufacture, that by &quot; armament firms &quot; they meanall  firms manufacturing munitions  and  not merely  those  fewwhich specialise or are mainly occupied in it.)  The Commission expressly renounce &apos;&apos; the task of formulatingspecific methods  for the restriction of profits  in  peace-time &quot;,but they think  it requires further consideration by the Govern-ment.  The Government are in entire agreement with  the  views ex-pressed by the  Commission as to the state of public feeling onthis subject, and  as to  the necessity for the restriction of profitson  the manufacture of armaments to  a level which can be re-garded as reasonable,  and  they have  given prolonged  andanxious consideration to the  question, especially  in connectionwith the re-armament  programme.   The measures  which theyhave adopted to  secure this end were  explained in the &quot; State-ment  Relating to Defence &quot;  (Cmd. 5107)  and  have  beenelaborated by Ministers on numerous occasions.  The procedure adopted by the Service Departments and the Treasury has been examined in detail by  the Estimates Committee since the Corn-mission reported, and is discussed at some length  in their reportof March 17th, 1937.  The report may  fairly be said to shewthat active steps have been taken to secure the object  which theCommission  had in view.  The  Committee draw attention  tothe  close co-operation  which has been established between theDepartments and say that &quot; they are satisfied that the methodsfollowed are soundly conceived and are fair both to the taxpayerand the contractor,  and they are of opinion, so  far as an esti-mate  can be formed, that they have  been effective up to  date in  preventing  profiteering at the  taxpayers expense&quot;.  TheCommittee make a  number of recommendations on  important points of  detail which  are  being  carefully considered.   The Government agree with their view &apos;&apos; that the whole position will need continual vigilance and that the Estimates Committee of a future year  might usefully  re-examine the question &quot;.   The Government will continue to give the closest attention to it.
15   The Commission contemplated that the control of profits would be one of the subjects falling within the purview of the single central organisation, the establishment of which they suggested in  Chapter VIII  of their Report.  For the  reasons given in paragraphs [20-24] 0^ this Paper, the Government do not pro- pose to set up such a  body as a peace-time organisation.  For the particular purpose  of the control of profits there is no reason to suppose that it would  prove more effective than the system actually in operation,  which ensures the closest co-operation between the Contracting Departments  and the Treasury,  not only through the Supply Board organisation referred to above, but also through  the  Contracts Co-ordinating Committee,  the Treasury Inter-Services Committee,  (the establishment of which was announced in the White Paper on Defence, Cmd. 5107) and the well-established practice in  the  Contracting Department of keeping each  other informed when  anyone of them places, or contemplates placing,  a contract  with  a firm  with which any other has dealings.  25. In the same Chapter the Commissioners refer to the con- scription  of industry,  and  their recommendation  as  given in Chapter XII is        &quot;&apos; We  are of  opinion  that  the  problems  involved  in     formulating plans for the conscription of industry in war-     time  will have to be faced and should be faced without     delay.&quot;  His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise that, if ever this country should  again become  involved in a major war, a  much wider measure of control over industry would be needed than in time of peace. Indeed, this conclusion  is plainly indicated  from the experience of the Great War, and provisional plans for this pur- pose, ready in case of need to be presented for parliamentary approval, have necessarily to be prepared beforehand.  26. As regards export control (Chapter X), the Commissioners expressly refrain  from recommending, under existing inter- national conditions, that  the foreign trade in  arms should be definitely abolished by this country acting  alone.   They state indeed  (paragraph 143) that a majority of them believe &quot; that the abolition of the private export trade in arms, unless it were adopted by all producing countries, would, in its total result,be ineffective  to remove the abuses that are  alleged  to exist, and are satisfied  that  one  of  the consequences of abolition,under present conditions, would  be to create possibilities  of international complication and undesirable  reaction  between governments which would constitute a greater danger to peacethan any of the consequences likely to flow from the continuanceof an export trade in  arms by  private firms.&quot;  But, notwith- standing this  conclusion, the  Commissioners  characterise as
                         &apos;   J6&quot; negative &quot; the existing  administration of the arms exportlicensing system, &quot; in that it does not seek actively to discouragethe export trade &quot;.  The Report records that official evidence was heard by the Commission to the effect that &quot; the foreign trade in arms  provides  an important and necessary part ofthe nucleus for the expansion of production in the eventualityof war &quot; and that &quot; its  encouragement is therefore  essential in the interest of imperial defence &apos;&apos;; (paragraph 146); but theCommissioners  say that they are not satisfied that the nucleusis in fact sufficiently great to justify a policy of active encourage-ment of the trade (paragraph 148).   Arguing from this point ofview the Commissioners express the opinion that      &quot; the administration of the system of  licensing exports of     arms should be governed by an outlook different  from and     more positive in character  than that which now prevails.&quot;  H.M. Government have carefully considered this recommenda-tion, but they are unable to accept the opinion of the Commis-sioners on which the recommendation is based, viz.:  that the nucleus of productive capacity due to the export trade  is so small that its reduction or disappearance would be a  matter ofindifference.  A nation like the U.K., which is a small millitary power in peace, but may  need to  become  a  large one in theevent of war in which respect this country differs from every other great European power is bound to  afford scope for thedevelopment of an export trade in armaments,  subject to propersupervision, in order to  maintain its productive capacity; forproductive capacity  cannot be equated with idle  plant.  this factor is  fundamental though temporarily overshadowed bythe requirements of our reconditioning programme and cannotbe ignored unless and until armaments are restricted by inter-national  agreement.  The international arms trade must inevit-ably continue so  long  as some nations are unable in whole orin part  to manufacture  the  war material  necessary  for  theirown self-defence; and, under existing conditions, it is imperative that British firms should not be unfairly  handicapped in thecompetition for export orders.  It follows that, without prejudice to the need for proper and adequate supervision of the trade,  the export licensing machinerymust be so administered as to eliminate unnecessary interferenceand delay:  otherwise British firms will  merely lose legitimatetrade to  their foreign competitors.  But  when the Commissioncall for &apos;&apos; a more positive outlook  &apos;&apos;  they explain that they mean&quot; the abandonment of the existing  policy under which licencesare granted in the absence of a specific and compelling reasonfor refusing them and the substitution  of a policy under whichit is made a part of the duty of the official authorised to grantlicences to satisfy himself  in each  case that there is need for
granting a licence taking all considerations into account &apos;&apos; (para-graph  149).  This amounts to a  proposal that the question tobe decided as regards any particular application for an export licence should be not whether there is any objection to the pro-posed  export,  but whether  the  export is  actually desirable.H.M. Government feel that not only would this principle resultin division  of  orders to  foreign countries,  but that the  dis-crimination involved would be liable to  engender friction in thepolitical relations between this country and other countries.  In so far,  therefore, as the Commission^ observations withregard to export control  stress the need for  careful supervision over  the  grant  of  export  licences, H.M.  Government  un-reservedly accept their Report.  They cannot, however, acceptthe recommendation that in future a  different  and &quot; more positive &quot; outlook should govern the administration of the ex-port licensing system, for they consider that this recommenda-tion is based on a misconception  of the  role which is and mustbe played  by  the arms  export  trade  in the  organisation ofimperial security.  The Commission go on to recommend that     &quot; licences  should be granted only  to such firms  as  shall    have been specifically authorised to  accept orders for export    by the  controlling body already recommended.&quot;On this point it is to be observed that all exports of war materialare already subject to the requirement that no such goods maybe shipped  unless the particular export has been specificallyauthorised.   In view of  this fact, H.M. Government considerthat no useful  purpose would be served by  superimposing thefurther requirement of a general authorisation of arms-exportingfirms.   Moreover, all manufacturers and dealers  in  arms arealready required to  be registered under the provisions of theFirearms Acts.  27. The  Commission also  recommend     &quot; that the grant of licences should be restricted to orders    by foreign Governments, supported by  import licences    issued  by  those Governments which shall state that the    goods will not be re-exported.&quot;In this connection it was  explained in the official evidence givento the Commission on behalf of the Board of.Trade (para. 26(2) ) that  already     &quot; the general practice of H.M. Government is to issue    licences for the export of war material only to Governments    or to accredited agents of Governments  for  delivery to    them.  In the case of material for testing purposes, samples    for demonstration&apos;or exhibition, or accessories, reputable    firms may be accepted as consignees.&quot;
                             i8Besides war material, the goods now subject to  export controlinclude personal weapons,  industrial explosives and  unarmedaircraft.   Here  the  general practice of confining the  issue of export licences to foreign Governments naturally does not apply,but  applications in  respect of  small  arms and  small arms ammunition  to   which  any suspicious  circumstances attachalways receive very close scrutiny, while the export of aircraft of military type to  undesirable destinations is prevented  by administrative measures of control.*  Thus the practice actually adopted goes a very long way  to-wards realising the Commission^ intention.  Where, however,  as is normally the  case, a foreign  Govern-ment is itself the purchaser of war material, H.M. government consider that it would be superfluous to require an import licencefrom the purchasing Government, and they have decided not torequire import authorisations unless and until these  are pro-vided for in an international agreement accepted by the Govern-ments of  other supplying countries.  28. The Commission conclude their proposals  on  the subjectof export control with the recommendation      &quot; that  the  practice of issuing open general  licences  for     certain classes  of arms, etc., be discontinued; that specific     licences be  required in all cases; and in particular that a     rigid  control be exercised  over all exports  of  aircraft,     whether classified as military or civil.&quot;  The classes of material at present covered by open generalexport licences (under which the goods in question  may be  ex-ported freely) are:         (a) Aircraft,   assembled   or  dismantled,  and  aircraft     engines;       lb)  bayonets, swords and lances;       (c) smooth-bore shotguns and shotgun  ammunition;       (d)  certain explosives  used  either for manufacture of     shotgun cartridges or for industrial  purposes;  and       (e) firearms  and ammunition covered by a U.K. firearm     certificate when exported in the possession of the  holder of     the certificate.The licences covering items (a)  to  (d) do not apply in the caseof export  to  certain defined geographical  areas.  In  the caseof the items (c), (d) and (e),  H.M. Government consider thatit  would  be undesirable to introduce  the hampering require-ment of specific licences for particular  exportations;  on  theother hand,  complete decontrol would be unadvisable.  Theyhave decided, therefore, that in respect of these items  the exist-ing open  general export licences should  be  maintained.  Withregard, however, to item (a)  H.M. Government have decided,after careful consideration, to  make a distinction between, on  * In future this control over military aircraft will be supplemented by the requirement of a specific export licence see below.
                            19the one hand,  civil  aircraft and  aircraft engines and, on  theother hand, aircraft of military types.   Real hardship wouldtensure if  the  Commission^  recommendation was  applied  to civil aircraft and H.M. Government do not feel that they wouldbe justified in imposing this handicap on civil flying in the U.K.in the absence  of similar requirements in other  countries.   Inthe event of an emergency  in which civil aircraft might  be exported for military purposes to a theatre  of  hostilities,  thesituation can be met under the existing regime by temporarilyrevoking the open general licence in respect of all aircraft des-tined for the country or countries concerned.  H.M. Governmenthave decided, however, to adopt  the Commission^  recommen-dation in so far as it applies to aircraft of military types, and early steps will be taken to implement this decision and at thesame time to withdraw the existing open general export licencein respect  of item (b)  (bayonets, swords  and lances), which also will thus become liable to the requirement of specific export licences.  29. In paragraph 152 of their Report the Royal Commissionstate that        &quot;It is  desirable that  the  Government should consider     whether the provisions  of the Foreign  Enlistment  Act,     1870, should not be extended so as to cover aircraft.&quot;  His Majesty&apos;s  Government  are  prepared to accept  thisrecommendation.  30. Finally,  in  Chapter XI  of their Report,  the  Commis-sioners deal with the question of  the disposal of surplus  arms,and in Chapter XII they recommend        &quot; The complete cessation of private  export trade in sur-     plus and second-hand arms and munitions  of war.&quot;The Royal  Commission appear to object to  the arrangementsconcluded in recent years  by the War Office for the  disposalof surplus  arms and munitions of war, and  in paragraph 156they state that        &quot; The trade in surplus or  second-hand arms appears to    - us to lack  any of the merits  that are claimed in favour of     the continuance of private  manufacture.&quot;It is pointed out that all transactions in connection with the saleof  second-hand arms and  munitions of war are subject tolicence as in the case of export of other arms.  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are not convinced that there is sufficient reasonfor abandoning altogether the sale of surplus and second-handarms and munitions of war to foreign Governments by privateagency, under proper  safeguards, but they are prepared toabandon the sale of surplus and second-hand arms and of muni-tions, as a regular practice, provided that the new  rule can bewaived in special cases.
