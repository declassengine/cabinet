      OUTDATE:-  21.4.37.-1- SECRET.              MESSAGE. TO:-  V.A.C. B.O.-S. 244.       C.  in C. Home Fleet 447       H.M.S. SHROPSHIRE.       Captain (D) 6.              Naval Cypher (A)nADDRESSED:-  V.A.O.&quot; B.C.S., repeated C.  in C.  Home Fleet,             SHROPSHIRE,  Captain (D)  6,  from Admiralty.IMMEDIATE.        The Government came  to their decision to  discourage  British  merchant shipping entering  Bilbao on the  ground that the  &quot;blockade was effective,  and  that any  attempt  to force the  entry  of British  shipping might  lead to  incidents inside territorial waters  which might  compromise their non-intervention policy.        This decision  depended on  the effectiveness  of  the blockade,  taken  in conjunction  with the risk  from mines,  and  was based upon the  actual facts  at  the time.    The  Government  would  not be  justified in  continuing to advise  British shipping  not  to  enter Bilbao unless there is  an effective  blockade  of  that port.    You will  bear in mind that  the Government have undertaken to give  assistance  to  British  shipping in  all circumstances up  to the three mile limit.    See  in  this connection  instructions as laid down in  first paragraph  of my  2030/17.        The Government have  since  had brought  to  their  notice the following  developments:-        (l)   The  entry into  Bilbao of the  steamship SEVEN              SEAS  SPRAY  on 20th April.        (2)   The  sailing from Bilbao  of 4 British ships              between 13th April and  16th April.
The passage of none of these ships has beeneffectively interfered with.(3)  The Chamber of Shipping cn review of reports     received, by them claim that Bilbao is not now     blockaded.(4)  II,I.u Consul at Bilbao reported as follows     (Telegram No. 11 of 17th April)        &quot;President this morning again insisted that     entrance to any territorial waters off Bilbao,     which are swept -thoroughly  daily., are clear of     mines, and that searchlights, patrols and     other precautions now render task of laying     mines exceedingly difficult if not impossible.     Shore batteries,  he states? possess range of     20j000 metres, thus offering effective protection     to merchant shipping in these waters.  Experts     are invited to verify these claims.        Government destroyer CISCAR arrived here     today Saturday,  and other Government warships     are expected shortly.        I have to offer personal observations that     on frequent occasions covering a period of six     monthss on which I have seen rebel warships     and armed trawlers from the shore and at s ea,     these have invariably kept out of range of     the Bilbao shore batteries.   On 5th March, when     the rebel cruiser CANARIAS ventured too near     in she was (group omitted) and suffered     casualties.&quot;     Prom this it appears that the Basque Government     maintain -that the shore defences can deal with     Insurgent ships  within the three-mile limit.     Do you agree?     Have you any evidence that Insurgent ships have     been within territorial waters off Bilbao?   If     so   when?  .(5)  1:1.11.  Consul at Bilbao also reports (telegram     No.  15 of 20th April)  as follows          &quot;Ships in since 1st April with cargoes          17;   in ballast 15.  Ships sailed with          cargo II9 in ballast 26.  Also 10 movements          of destroyers and armed merchant ships in          and out.          During the  past month. I have frequently     observed mine-sweeping activities from the     shore and at sea.   Twenty-two sweepers are now     said to be sweeping daily territorial waters     and beyond off Bilbao?  but no mines have been     swept since 16th  March and my impression is     that this is in  accordance with the facts,&quot;
     In view of the aboves  Government would like from you up to date statement of present facts about  Bilbao  sofar as you can obtain them and as soon as possible.Consul Bilbao is being asked to amplify his report  at(5) giving in particular nationality and port  of departure or destination of ships which have entered orsailed, distinguishing between ships carrying  food  andother cargoes, and stating which of the ships  he mentionsarrived or sailed since blockade was first reported as effective on 6th April by BLANCHE (2220/6).                            2030/21.
tiTo V.A.O. ,  B.CS,    Go in G. Home  Fleet                      Date  21/4/37,                          Naval Cypher A.Addressed V,A.C,B,C.S., repeated C. in Cc Home Fleet.From Admiralty,  Following personal from D. Co IT, S.       My 2030/21 First Lord is anxious that you  should realise that these requests for further  reports should not he thought in any way to  question or cast doubt upon information which  has been received prom Naval sources in the past.       The position is that Cabinet policy depends  on whether blockade is, or is not, effective, and  they wish to review the position continually in  the light of the latest information available.  Any information as to the state of efficiency of  the coast defences at Bilbao should be included.       They are particularly anxious that you should  reply immediately on information quickly available    &apos;  ;./; &quot;                W-^Mii    \             &apos;  and not postpone a reply whilst further information  is being obtained.,                                2130/21.  .
