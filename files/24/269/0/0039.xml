Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1937.SECRET.                                                         Copy  No.  4gCP. 134  (37).CABINET.NATIVE POLICY IN  THE  UNION  OF SOUTH AFRICA.        Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.    I RECENTLY circulated to my colleagues a copy of a despatch from theUnited Kingdom High Commissioner in the Union of South Africa dealing withthe views of Mr. Pirow  on the native problem, and also the text of Mr. Pirow&apos;broadcast (CP. 121).  It may interest my colleagues to read also a despatch whichI have now received from the High  Commissioner regarding a recent speech byMr. Hofmeyr on the same subject, and also  a  newspaper  report of his speech.Mr. Hofmeyr is a colleague of Mr. Pirow&apos;s in  the Union Cabinet, being a memberof General Smuts&apos;s party.   Though he is a man of great ability, I  fear that onthis question of native policy he is fighting a losing battle.  It looks likely thatthe wide and public divergence of view on this important subject will sooner or later produce a split in the present Union Cabinet.                                                                   M. M.    Dominions Office, May  3, 1937.                                  Office of the High Commissioner                                         for  the  United Kingdom,Sir,                                            Cape  Town, April  1, 1937.    IN recent  correspondence  I  have drawn your  attention to differences ofopinion on questions of policy towards the  non-European races in South Africawhich have threatened to bring about a split in the Cabinet and, as a possibleresult,  the resignation of  Mr. Hofmeyr.   These  circumstances  lent  a special interest to the fact that Mr.  Hofmeyr was under  a promise  to deliver thegraduation day address at the South African Native College at Fort Hare on the24th March, as it was felt that the surroundings and atmosphere of the occasionmight stimulate him to flights of liberalism which might be decisive in their effecton his  relations with his colleagues.  The speech has now been made, and it is significant that the Cape Times,  whose report  is enclosed, has considered  it  tobe of sufficient  importance to be reproduced with unusual fullness.  It is a  firmrestatement of  the views which Mr. Hofmeyr has long been known to hold;  itbears no  traces  of recantation,  nor does  it  indicate  any leaning  towardscompromise.  It is, in fact, the natural corollary, as a speech to a native audience,of his  address  to the  Department of Bantu Studies at the University of theWitwatersrand, a white audience, discussed in Mr. Antrobus&apos;s despatch No. 339of the 28th August last.     2.   What,  Mr. Hofmeyr asked, should be the aim of  the Union&apos;s educationpolicy?  Should the Government  set before the native the ideal of development on his  own lines?   &quot; I do not like,&quot; he said, &quot; that phrase &apos; the development  ofthe native on his own lines.&apos;  All too  often it is a  cloak for sheer hypocrisy.All  too often it  means ....  keeping  the  native in his  place.&quot;   He declaredthat he would never subscribe to  an education policy conceived  to  that  end,though he recognised  that many people  found  a really  valuable constructive       [15157]                 &apos;                      &apos;               B
ideal  implicit  in  the conception.   He  himself, however,  could not  close hiseyes to the extent to which the validity  of  that ideal was impaired by the factthat the  ideal of segregation, with which it was naturally associated,  was only very partially realisable in South Africa.    3.  Nevertheless, he  did concur in the  view that the aim and  scope  ofEuropean and African education could not be the same, and to that extent was prepared to accept the doctrine of native development along native lines.  Theprocess of education, he said, has to be related both to the environment from whichthe pupil comes, and to the environment of the life for which he is being prepared;and those two environments, for the native  and for the European, were, in fact,distinct,  though not necessarily distinct for all time.   He, however, held verydefinitely that, if to this extent the African is to be educated on his own lines,he must  be allowed to decide for himself what those lines should be and whichelements in his indigenous culture should be preserved.  That decision, saidMr. Hofmeyr, could best be taken by educated Africans, and it was an essential part of the work of Fort Hare to train such men.    4.  Mr. Hofmeyr then turned from native education policy to general native policy.   Just as he had argued that the aim of native education should be to minister to a distinctive native development, so he claimed that such development should be the aim of general native policy in the Union.   He quoted Dr. Oldhamas saying that as men are equal in the possession of a personality that is worthy of reverence, so they are equal in the right to the development of that personality,so far as may be compatible with the common good.   &quot; In that sense,&quot; he said,&quot; I set no limits to the development of which the African is capable and to which he has a right.   Moreover, I can see no solution of what I refuse to call the nativeproblem, what I shall call the problem of race relations, save on  the basis of the recognition that white man and black man are  possessors of a  common humanity.&quot;    5.  To our ears this sounds almost a commonplace, but it  is, of course, very far from being  the view generally  entertained in this country.  Mr.  Hofmeyrwent  on to discuss that alternative conception which denies  the possibility of equality  in any respect and at any time and insists on the permanent inferiorityof the African.   This is a conception, he said, which is  derived from  inheritedattitudes of mind rather than from facts;  it is determined  by sentiment ratherthan by  logic;  and its holders, when beaten in argument, have  to fall back ontraditions handed down to them from the frontiersman and the pioneer.   On thispoint, Mr. Hofmeyr was able to appeal to the authority of General Smuts, who,in the course of a speech on the occasion  of his installation as Chancellor of cape  Town University, had urged his audience to be loyal  to &apos;&quot;&apos; fact,  objective,impartial fact,&quot; and who had gone on to preach the  gospel of tolerance amonghumans,  the  gospel, in his own phrase, of &quot; racial indifference &quot; as the veryfoundation of our human culture.   Mr. Hofmeyr insisted that these principleswere no  less valid at Fort Hare than at Groote Schuur; that  they could not beregarded as being applicable  only in the academic atmosphere and so as having no  value in  setting the  standards of  political action in relation to  political problems, including that of race relations.  &quot; I  have no hesitation,&quot;  he said,&quot; in accepting them as lamps by which to light my own political course.&quot;  Ifthese  principles are accepted, he argued, it means that European South Africawill be prepared to deal with all questions of race relations on their  merits asdisclosed by  the facts and  will not allow the examination of these facts  to be subordinated to considerations  of  political expediency.  It means that in theacceptance of the concept of racial indifference, at least as an ideal, it will reject the view which regards the  inferiority of one element in that community assomething permanent and something inevitable.  &quot; To do all this,&quot; he concluded,&quot; South  Africa will need, as General Smuts said, to practise the larger  faith andfollow the larger vision &quot; without which &quot; political activity in South Africa canonly degenerate into blatant self-seeking or specious hypocrisy.&quot;    6.   There was a certain malice in  this appeal to General Smuts, since theGeneral, in these recent controversies, has scarcely displayed the  temper of mindwhich he commended to  the  students of Cape Town University.   &apos; Objective,impartial fact&apos;&apos; has been all on the side of  Mr. Hofmeyr in his opposition to the asiatic bills, but he has not received General Smuts&apos;s support, and I  fancy weshall  hear more of the latter&apos;s  University speech when the bills come again
Extract from Cape Times, March 25, 1937.MR.  HOFMEYR  DISCUSSES  NATIVE EDUCATION.      European and African Differences.                     Graduation Address at Fort Hare.    IN  his  graduation day  address  at the South African Native  College  atFort Hare yesterday, Mr. J* H. Hofmeyr, Minister of Education, while agreeing that the aim of native education was to minister to distinctive native development,said that he could see no solution of the problem of race relations save on thebasis of recognising that white and  black people possessed a common humanity.    Mr. Hofmeyr, after mentioning that he had given graduation addresses  atall but one of the South African Universities, continued :     &quot; There are no doubt respects in which the South African Native College isthe least among its brethren, but it is certainly not the least in its opportunities,or in the destiny which it is challenged to fulfil.        &apos;&apos; Let  it  not be  forgotten  that  this  college is called upon, almost    exclusively,  to meet the higher educational needs and in large measure  to    shape the educational destiny of  a far greater population than is served  by    all the rest of our university institutions taken together.  There is something    at once terrifying and exhilarating in the magnitude of this College&apos;s task.    &quot; I doubt if there are any educationists who have more need of the sympathy and the prayers of all men of goodwill  than  those to  whom that task has  been committed.  But I doubt also if there is any educational task in South Africa morechallenging, more stimulating, more inspiring  than that which is  theirs.    &apos;&apos; One essential part of that task is what I would describe as  the ministry  of reconciliation.  Here  at this  place blood has flown in fierce warfare betweenEuropeans and Africans.   Here at this place Europeans have toiled and spentthemselves in the giving to Africans of the greatest of all gifts,  the  gift of the christian gospel.    &apos;&apos; Here at this place there stands a college, established mainly by the labour of Europeans, to enable Africans  to  enter into that  worldwide fellowship  oflearning and culture which transcends differences of race and colour.  For in the forefront of the university ideal stands the concept of universality, implying thatthe conquests of the human spirit are the common possessions of all men.  So  atthis place out of the struggles and differences of  the past there have grown unityin the possession of the cultural heritage  of the past, and  partnership in the pursuit of wider knowledge for the further enrichment of that heritage.      [15157]                                                     B 2before Parliament.  It will also be observed that the concept of  race relations which Mr. Hofmeyr so strenuously condemned is that held with fervour by mostof his colleagues in the Cabinet.  His speech, therefore, is not calculated to pouroil on the troubled waters,  but it was a fine utterance and the principles whichhe enunciated are principles which badly need enunciation by a man in high placein South Africa to-day, and especially by a man who has earned the reputation of not saying a thing unless he means it.    7.   I also enclose a. copy of General  Smuts&apos;  speech  to which Mr. Hofmeyrreferred.                                   I have the honour to be,                                            Sir,                                       Your most  obedient, humble servant,                                                W. H. CLARK,                                                      High Commissioner.The Right Hon. Malcolm MacDonald, M.P.,          &amp;c,    &amp;c,     &amp;c,                Dominions Office.
     &apos;&apos; I trust that the greatest of the lessons taught at this college will ever be the truth that, great as are the differences that distinguish us, there is in our common humanity, in its origin, in its achievements, in its divinely-appointed task, a unity which transcends those differences.                               Highest Honour.     &apos;&apos; I pass naturally  from what I have been saying to draw your attention to a fact which gives special significance to this occasion.  For the first time in the history of our country a South African university has  decided  to  confer the highest possible academic distinction, an honorary doctorate, on a native African.         &apos;&apos; By honouring the Rev. John Dube the University of South  Africa has     honoured a man who has laboured unremittingly in the service of his people,     a man who has blended European cultural ideals with all that is best in his     own inherited tradition; but it has also honoured itself, and (I  know you will     not misinterpret  my meaning) it has honoured the European people of South     Africa.     &quot; Surely the significance of the gesture cannot be lost when a South African University,  controlled  exclusively  by  Europeans, regards a  native African as worthy of its highest degree with all  the traditions of Western  culture which cannot be dissociated  from it.  I  regard it as nothing less  than a courageous acceptance of the truth that there  are no limits to the educational advancement which men of Bantu stock are capable of attaining.     &apos;&apos; Having said that, I cannot fail to ask myself  the question, what should be the aim of our Native Education policy ?  I am speaking at an occasion when the degrees of a European  University are being  conferred  on  African students  who have completed the same courses  and taken the same examinations as the European graduates of that university.  Moreover that university has admitted a native African as an honorary graduate to its Convocation.   Does that necessarily imply that we are seeking in  South Africa to mould the native African to the pattern of our European civilisation with all possible speed, to divest him of his inherited culture and traditions,  to point him to our own footprints as marking the only path to educational advancement ?  Or, in the  alternative, is the  ideal that we should set before him  that of development on  his own lines ?     &apos;&apos; Let me be  frank with you.  I do  not like that phrase, &apos;  the development of the native on his own lines.&apos;  All too often it is  a cloak for sheer hypocrisy.  All too often it means either no development at all or as little development as possible; it means keeping the  native &apos; in his place.&apos;   And for all too many of the people of this country the real thought which underlies that phrase  is expressed in Dickens&apos;  version  of  the ancient  prayer,  quoted  by the Inter-Departmental Committee on Native  Education :          &apos; Oh, let us love our occupations,          Bless the squire and his relations,          Live upon our daily rations,          And always know our proper stations.&apos;     &apos;&apos; No, I cannot help feeling suspicious when that phrase  is used.  Certainly I for my part shall never subscribe to a Native Education  policy so conceived as to subserve the doctrine of keeping the native in his place.  Moreover, although I readily acknowledge that for many people there is a really valuable constructive ideal implicit in the concept of the development of the native  on his own lines, I cannot close my eyes to  the extent to which the validity of that ideal is impaired by the fact that  the segregation ideal,  with  which it is naturally  associated, isonly very partially realisable in South Africa. The education  of the native along his own lines is naturally a much more practicable ideal in relation to the native living  in his own territories than to the native, very often detribalised, living onthe white man&apos;s farms or in the white man&apos;s towns.                       Scope &quot; Cannot be the Same.&quot;     &quot; Yet I do accept the ideal  of the education, of the African on his own lines in so far as it means that in present circumstances at least the aim and scope ofEuropean and  African education  cannot  be the same.  Why do  I  say that?
Because, as I see it, the educational process has to be related both to the environ-ment from which the pupil comes and to the environment for life  in which heis being prepared.    &quot; Now the average African  child in South Africa comes from a differentenvironment from that of the average European child he has a different social and cultural heritage; it is surely unsound educationally to require him to turnhis back on that heritage.    &quot;Moreover, the texture of his adult life will almost certainly be different.It may  be desirable or undesirable, we may approve of it or not, but the fact remains that his opportunities will be fewer, his social  range more limited, hisenvironment more restricted. These are facts, unpalatable or not, of which theeducationist  must  take  account,  nor should  he  assume that they will  have dissapeared by the  time that the  product of the system which he is  devising has grown into manhood.  And that  being so, it does  seem to me to follow that thescope and content of education  should not in present circumstances be the samefor the African as for the European.    &apos;&apos; But if I have accepted, though  it be with qualifications, the concept of theeducation  of the African on his own lines, I would argue the importance of going on to face a further question which arises from its acceptance.  If the Africanis to be educated on his  own lines, who is  to  determine what those lines  shallbe?  Here  I associate  myself  wholeheartedly  with  the  Inter-departmentalCommittee on Native Education in the view that this is a matter primarily forthe African himself.  If the system of native  education is to develop naturallyalong a  distinctive  course it is not for us Europeans presumptuously to decide what is best for those of whose cultural background we have necessarily but an inadequate understanding.     &quot; In the words of the committee :  &apos; The native should be allowed to decide for himself which elements in his indigenous culture should be preserved.&apos;   Thatdecision can best be taken by educated  Africans,  men who, while they  haveretained their contacts with their African heritage, have also imbibed  what is best in European culture.        &quot; It is an  essential part of the work  of this  college to train such men,    to give them the best it can in education on &quot;Western lines, while consciously    stimulating their continued  allegiance to their African past,  and to hold    ever before them the challenge to go  out among their own people and  build    for them their  own system of education.   Such a system  will take from both    these  elements  what is best suited to  their needs, will start from their store    of inherited experience, and  will adjust their aptitudes and their attitudes    of mind to the  environment in which they will have their being.        &quot; I believe that the college is, to-day, not unworthily fulfilling that task.     &quot; I have suggested that it should be accepted as the aim of native education to minister to distinctive native development.   I accept such  development as alsothe right aim of our general native policy. There are facts of difference of which account must be  taken there  is no absolute  equality  between European  and African.  As Dr. Oldham  has pointed out, men are not equal in their capacity to serve the community, nor are they equal in their needs.  Of these inequalitiesour policy of development through education and otherwise must take due account.     &quot; But, as Dr. Oldham went on to say, men are equal in the possession of apersonality that is worthy of reverence.  They are equal in the right to thedevelopment of that personality so far as may be compatible with the commongood.     &quot; In that sense I set no limits to the development of which the African is capable and to  which he has a right.  Moreover, I can  see no solution of  what i refuse to call the native problem, what I shall call the problem of race relations,save on  the basis of the recognition that white man and black man are possessorsof a common humanity that they are, in fact, equal at the very least in the sense of being equally God&apos;s creatures  and in  all that that implies.                           A alternative Conception.      What  is the  alternative conception ?  It is a conception which is derivedfrom inherited attitudes of mind rather  than from facts, which is determinedby sentiment and not by logic, which denies the possibility  of equality  in any
respect and at any time, which insists on the permanent inferiority of the African,which regards with ill-concealed anxiety any sign of his advance, and when thosewho hold it are beaten in argument they fall back on an appeal to the traditionswhich have come down to them from the pioneer and the frontiersman.     &quot; This is  an academic occasion.  Not so long  ago  at another academicoccasion, at  his  installation as Chancellor of  the  University of Cape Town,General Smuts enunciated certain principles by which this issue can best be tested.Those are principles which are no less valid at Fort Hare than at Groote Schuur,and they cannot be regarded as being applicable only in the academic atmosphere,as having  no value  in  setting the standards of political action  in  relation to political &quot;problems, including the problem of race relations of which I am speaking.For my part, at least, I have no hesitation in accepting them as lamps by which to light my own political course.     &apos;&apos; Let me remind you of some of the things  that General Smuts said.  First,there was his appeal to his audience-and in reality his audience was all  SouthAfrica to appreciate and to be loyal at all costs to fact, objective impartial fact,to turn away from the childish atmosphere of sentiment and prejudices, and fromthe world of opinions and passions of  our maturer years.   He urged that thisdisinterested loyalty to  facts is the sovereign remedy for our public world ofto-day, where the tendency is to follow slogans, to run after catchwords, to worshipideologies, or to exalt party politics unduly.    &apos;&apos; Secondly, he  preached  the gospel  of  toleration  among  humans,  thefundamental  recognition of the common  humanity of all men,  to the extent, to use his own phrase, of racial indifference, as the very foundation of our human culture.    &quot;These  principles  are, of course, of far  wider application than merely inrespect of the problem of race relations in our own land; but they none the lesshave a meaning in relation to that problem, and it is right that on an occasionlike this the question should be asked what that meaning is.  I would put it inthis way.  If European South Africa is to accept these principles, it means thatit will no longer appeal to past traditions in native policy, but will seek to removeits consideration  of that policy from  the  sphere of prejudice and of sentiment.         &quot;  It means that it will be prepared to deal with all  questions of race    relations on  their merits as disclosed by the facts, and not be willing to    allow the examination of those facts to be subordinated to considerations of    political  expediency.  It means that it will take equal account of the  feelings    and sentiments and vital interests of all elements of the community; it means    that in the acceptance  of the concept of  racial indifference, at least as  an    ideal, it will reject the view which  regards the inferiority  of one element in    that community as something permanent and something inevitable.    &quot; To do  all this, South Africa will need, as General Smuts said,  to  practisethe larger  faith and  follow the larger  vision, but let us not forget the eternaltruth that where there is no vision the people  will perish.  Faith and vision areno mere  academic qualities; they are  essential in the nation&apos;s  life, and  without them  political activity in South Africa can only degenerate into blatant  self-seeking or  specious hypocrisy.    &quot; I  have wandered, perhaps, somewhat  far from what is regarded  as appropriate  to  the  scope of a  graduation  address.   Let  me return to  theimmediate  purpose of such an address.  I would speak, briefly as  needs  must atthis stage,  to those who have had to-day  conferred upon them, as  the crown oftheir  student careers, the degrees of the University of South Africa. In itself the conferment of a degree means no more than that the recipient has acquired asufficient amount of  information  to  satisfy  (or  possibly  even to deceive)  hisprofessors and his examiners.  But the  real meaning of a university degree goesfar deeper.    &quot; The chancellor of a great university once said  that it should  imply thatthe graduate  has spent a number of years  fruitfully in an atmosphere capable ofinspiring him with all that is highest and best in human life.  I hope that it is so in your case.  I hope that you are going forth from this  college with high andworthy ideals,  I  hope that your minds have  been so set  that, in a  phrase  ofMr. Stanley Baldwin, they will turn upon the poles of truth and that you maystand out as balanced men in an unbalanced world.  I hope that you have acquirednot only knowledge, but also understanding and wisdom, not least that wisdom atthe foundation of which there is set the fear of  the Lord.
                             One further  Wish.     &quot; I have one further wish for you, and that is that whatever the difficulties and  discouragements you may encounter (and I have no doubt that they will be many) you will remain true  to this  college and  to its  mission.  Here you havedrunk of the finest vintage of life;  here you have formed your richest and mostenduring  friendships;  here  you have set  up  for  yourselves  a storehouse ofmemory, full of jewels that will never lose their gleam.  It has been good for you to be here.  But it is  not for you to  build on this mountain tabernacles for yourabiding you must go forth.   You must take the spirit of Fort  Hare, you mustcarry its ministry of reconciliation down into the crowded haunts of men.  you must continue to extend the work of  blending the culture that you have acquiredhere  with  the traditions that you  have  inherited  for the promotion of the distinctive development of your people.        &apos;&apos; Your task, if you conceive it in that spirit, will not be easy.  You will     need faith and you will  need patience.   But it will be in the spirit of your     college for you to display those qualities, for it is on those qualities that your     college has itself  been built.     &apos;&apos; For  the rest, I would remind you of the last message which Thomas Carlylesent  as rector to the students of the University of Edinburgh : &apos; Bid them in myname, if they still love me, fight the  good fight, and  quit themselves like men, inthe warfare to which  they are as if conscript and  consecrated, and  which liesahead.  Tell them to  consult the eternal oracles (not yet inaudible, nor ever tobecome  so  when worthily enquired  of), and  to  disregard nearly altogether in comparison the  temporary noises,  menacings and  deliriums.   May  they  lovewisdom, as wisdom,  if  she  is to yield her  treasures, must be loved piously,valiantly, humbly, beyond life itself or the prizes of  life, with all our hearts andall our soul.  In that case, and not in any other case, shall it be well with them.&apos; &quot;-
