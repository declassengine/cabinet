Xt^                          CABINS To                        CALCIUM CARBIDE.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister for the Co-ordination            of Defence,       In pursuance of the statement made on &quot;behalf of theGovernment by the Secretary of State for Scotland on theSecond Reading Debate on the Caledonian Water Power Bill, 1937,I said, in answer to a question on the 15th instant, that asmall commit tee composed of persons not in the government service was being set up to advise the Government as to what should now be done, the House having refused the Bill a SecondReading.       The central claim made by the British Oxygen company in support of the Bill was that calcium carbide could only be economically produced in this country by the use of hydro-electric power and that an adequate supply of such power isonly to be obtained in the West Highlands in the manner proposed in the Bill.  Other secondary grounds were adducedin favour- of the scheme such as easy and cheap shipping facilities at Corpach.  But the main point was the necessityof using hydro-electric paver..  The Company, however, havestated that, even with hydro-electric power, some import duty would probably be needed to establish the industry.       It was maintained on the other side that, since boththe raw materials of  calcium carbide, anthracite coal andlimestone, are available in South Wales, it should be possibleto assist that Special Area by siting the industry there and using electric power derived from coal, setting any extra costresulting therefrom (the extent of which, if any, is a matter
of controversy) against the saving due to not having to transport the raw rra terials from Wales to the Highlands.It is contended that since a duty is in any case claimed tohe necessary, any advantage of costs on &quot;balance in favourof the Highlands scheme could he covered by a slightlyincreased rate of duty.        (The statement made by the Secretary of State forScotland on behalf of the Government was that there was no promise of any duty or of any subsidy).        The above being the main issue on which the Committeeis to advise, the terms of reference might be &quot;to consider andreport on any schemes which may be submitted to them for theproduction of calcium carbide and allied products in theUnited Kingdom, with particular reference to the schemeembodied in the Caledonian Water Power Bill, 1937&quot;.        The problem under these terms of reference is purelya business problem.  I have therefore in mind a committee ofthree persons unconnected with the issues raised, the Chairmana member of the Upper House such as Lord Essendon, LordMacmillan or Lord Luke, combined with two men of general engineering and also of business training such as, for example,Mr. A, McKinstry, Managing Director of Messrs. Babcock &amp;Wilcox, and Mr. Peter Bennett, O.B. 3. , J. P. , Joint managing director of Joseph Lucas, Ltd. and a Vice President of theFederation of British  Industries.        The Secretary to the Committee would be from thestaff of the Committee of Imperial Defence.  It must hearevidence though it need not sit in public.   Its report mayhave to be published.        When the report is forthcoming, the  Government can give further consideration to the more political considera-
tions raised &quot;by the controversy, including the large questionwhether the need of home production of calcium carbide is sufficiently strong on Service and industrial grounds tojustify the imposition of a duty and the consequentialamendment of the Norwegian Trade Agreement under which thearticle is now imported free.  It will also be necessary toconsider the effect on the using industries of a duty oncalcium carbide*                              (Sgd. )  T.  W. H.
