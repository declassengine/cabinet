Copy No.CABINET.INCREASING- THE PRODUCTIVITY  OF  THE  SOIL.                   FURTHER PROPOSALS.             Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland.    IN the course of the discussion on cereals at the meeting of the Cabinet onthe 6th May, it was suggested that the oats  problem should be looked at from a wider point of view, and the Cabinet decided (Cabinet 21 (37), conclusion 1) thatI should,  in  consultation with the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence and a representative  of the Treasury,consider some form of appropriate assistance to agriculture as an alternative tothe proposals in favour of assistance to oats in CP. 125 (37) and CP. 136 (37).In undertaking this consideration I have taken it (a) that the object  in view is tomaintain and, if  possible, increase home production of  feeding stuffs, both oats and young grass, in view of the  pressure upon the Government to take steps toincrease home agricultural production as  a defence measure,  and  (b) that  any sums necessary to secure this object should be provided from national sources.    2.  The  consideration of such a  scheme is  simplified by the  fact that as recently as the  summer of 1936 the nature  and feasibility of  proposals with asimilar scope were examined interdepartmentally by  representatives  of  theTreasury,  the Board  of  Trade,  the  Dominions  Office and  the   agricultural departments.  This examination brought out that a scheme  could be devised which  would obviate the dangers of  unlimited assistance to oat-growers.  Itenvisaged  an option on the part of farmers to register  for assistance either inrespect of wheat  or oats,  but not both.  Wheat growers are already registered under the  Wheat  Act.   The acreage of oats likely to qualify on this  basis would,on present figures of production, be about 1,300,000 in the United Kingdom, or about 1,000,000 acres if the scheme were limited to Great Britain.    3.  I  have  taken an option of this sort as the basis of the scheme  which I now propose to outline, but in view of the  defence aspects of the  case I have assumed that we  should allow for the possibility Of a moderate  expansion, say,10 per  cent.,* though it is quite probable  that on the low rate of assistanceproposed this will  not be reached.  The  acreage figure  thus  determined wouldbe the standard acreage for the purpose of the  scheme.    4.  Assistance would clearly have  to vary according  to the prevailing market price.   There would, for example, be no justification in paying subsidy in a yearsuch as the present when the market price of oats is not such as would justifyany special measures being taken.   Our object is not to provide a  general anduniform subsidy  for oat growers, but to frame a  scheme of insurance against    * The estimated increase in the wheat acreage expected  from the Minister of Agriculturalproposals is  of the order of  10 per cent.

unreasonably low prices, and thus to ensure the productivity of the soil by keeping the land  under the plough.  I  should accordingly propose to take  measuressomewhat as follows :     5.  A &quot; notional &quot; standard price of, say, 24s. per quarter  should be fixed.Average annual market prices should be ascertained.  When the average market price in any year was equal to, or greater than, the standard price nothing wouldbe payable to the farmer.   When it was below the standard, a deficiency paymentequal to twice the difference between  the standard and market prices  would bepaid in respect of each eligible acre of oats, on the footing that, on the average,two quarters  per acre are sold  off farms.  Thus when the market price  was 1 a quarter, subsidy would be at the rate of 8s. per acre.  When the market price was 17s. Qd., the assistance would be 13s. per acre.   When it was 14s., theassistance would be at the rate of  1 per acre.  In no case should the assistanceexceed  1 per acre.    6.  The effect of this proposal would be to limit the total Treasury liability in any year to a sum  equal to  1 multiplied by  the standard acreage (that is,1,300,000 acres for the United Kingdom, plus, say, 10 per cent.).  This maximumwould be reached only in very abnormal circumstances and the effect  of havingit  laid down would be to provide an automatic check on over-production.   Thescheme would also ensure to the grower of oats  a return of 24s.  a quarter inrespect of two quarters an acre.   The amount sold off the farm is, on the average,not likely to exceed this.  A remunerative  &quot; white &quot; crop would thus be securedand from every point of view this seems to be the most important consideration.    7.  I should also suggest that, with  a view to  limiting still further theliability, of  the Treasury, the  scheme need  cover only the  period of the present defence programme, that is, the  period till 1941.   It would also provide for a review some time before that  date, in the  light of its working,  of the trend ofcereal prices, and of the  nature of future defence requirements.    8.  I have discussed a scheme on these  lines with the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries, the  Minister for  Co-ordination of  Defence,  and the  FinancialSecretary to the Treasury.  It would be administratively practicable.   It wouldalso,  I  believe,  maintain the production  of oats  without  bringing  about an embarrassing  flooding of  the market.  As  to the national  importance of thequestion, it must be  remembered  that oats  remain the largest single crop grownin the United Kingdom.  Oats are an essential feeding stuff and rotation crop,which would,  moreover,  become of  immense importance in  a time of national emergency.  It seems clearly, therefore, to be of the first importance to take stepsto ensure that the acreage under oats is maintained and possibly increased.   Thesituation  has  been deteriorating.  Since the war the acreage  under  oats hasdiminished slowly in Scotland and more rapidly in England.   In the last 10 years the acreage has fallen in Scotland from 940,000 to 826,000 and in England, where an alternative has existed, from 1,863,000 to 1,418,000.   The proposals I  havemade would, I believe, provide an insurance against any further  deterioration inthe situation, which,  if  it occurred,  would be  extremely embarrassing to theGovernment from the point of view  of defence.    9.  Thus far I have  considered the problem  from the  point of view of oats.The Lord Privy Seal, however, in the course of discussions at the Cabinet, referredto the position of the barley growers.  If the matter is to be  considered from the widest point of view,  I think there is no  doubt  that a scheme of insurance foroat growers should be extended also to growers of barley.     10.  This admittedly presents a certain amount of difficulty for two reasons.In the first place, it is necessary to ensure that assistance goes to the barley growerswho require it and  not  to growers of the best  quality malting samples whichgenerally command satisfactory  prices.  I think this difficulty  is substantiallyovercome by the fact that high quality malting barley is for the most part grownin the wheat-producing counties  and would  therefore, under  the option which Ipropose, be largely excluded. Machinery could, if necessary, be devised to excludeall malting barley, but I  believe that the amount likely to qualify for assistance is so small as  to make  it unnecessary to incur the  extra administrative  costs  thatwould be involved.
    11.  In the second place, the wide variety of prices which different qualities of barley command makes it difficult to apply, as is proposed in the case of oats,the test of an average and a  &quot; notional &quot; standard price.  The barley  whichwould come under the scheme is, however, barley used for feeding stuff, and itsprice  would therefore vary generally with the price of oats and  other alternativefeeding stuffs.  The Minister of Agriculture has accordingly suggested that inthe case of barley the subsidy payment should be at the same rate per acre as thaton  oats.   I think that this  suggestion overcomes the difficulty caused  by the varying prices of malting and feeding barley, and the detailed working out of ascheme, subject to the same general limitations        proposed in the case of oats, need present no difficulty.    12.  I propose,  therefore,  that the scheme of insurance should be extendedto barley.  This would involve only a relatively small additional cost, since theeligible acreage to which it would apply would be of the order of 400,000 acresfor the United Kingdom.    13.  I would commend these proposals to my colleagues as a real contributionto the solution of the problem of maintaining, and where possible increasing, thevolume of  production from the soil in areas where  our other measures are for various reasons inapplicable.  They will insure us against a further decrease inour production of feeding stuffs already 900,000  tons below the pre-war level,although our livestock population has increased.   They will increase the acreageunder rotation grass,  and so increase our sources  of animal food  and  animalfats.   And they will,  taken  in conjunction with the proposals  of the Ministerof  Agriculture already approved by the Cabinet, provide an  adequate  answer to  the persistent demands for  the  improvement of home  agriculture   in theinterests of national defence and relieve the pressure upon  the Government  toadopt a policy of food storage.   Such a policy is at present impracticable, apart altogether from the enormous cost involved, owing to the impossibility of finding the labour and material necessary for the construction of silos,  and to  the worldshortage of grain, which would rule out at present the purchase of cereals  for storage.   We cannot, however,  refrain from taking some action, and the Ministerof  Agriculture&apos;s  proposals, if  supplemented by a scheme such  as is outlined  inthis Memorandum, seem to me to be in present circumstances a feasible alternativewhich can be  put into operation immediately  without involving any  furthercommitment to the Treasury other than that which I have indicated.    14.  As indicated  above, the foregoing proposals have been discussed withthe Minister  for  Co-ordination of Defence, the Minister of  Agriculture andFisheries and the Financial Secretary to the Treasury.  The Financial secretary has not yet had an opportunity of discussing the matter with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer,  whose  position  is  accordingly  reserved.   The Minister-  for Co-ordination of Defence thinks that, from the point of view  of defence, it isimportant to arrest  the decline in the production of oats and  barley.  He  cannothimself express any opinion as to the practicability or  the effect of the  scheme now proposed.  On  the assumption, however, that the Scheme is practicable andwill prevent any further reduction in the acreage of land producing oats and barley, and will  even increase  the acreage, he regards the Scheme as a usefulcontribution to a food and feeding stuffs policy as an alternative to food storage. The  Minister of  Agriculture  is  in  agreement  with the  proposals   of  the Memorandum.                                                                  W. E. E.Scottish Office, Whitehall,     May 19, 1937.
