I circulate herewith an extract from the draft minutes of the 292nd Meeting of the Committee of ImperialDefence?containing their recommendations to the Cabineton the subject of insurance against aircraft and bombard-ment risks under the conditions of a future war.       I attach also the Memorandum by the President ofthe Board of Trade (Paper No. 1316-B) which was underconsideration by the Committee of Imperial Defence.(Intdo)  T.W.H.I.2, Whitehall  Gardens,  S.W.I.,    19th April,  1937.
Printed for  the Committee of Imperial Defence.  April 1937.SECRET.                                                       Copy No.  44COMMITTEE  OF IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.Extract from the Draft Minutes of the 292nd Meeting, held on April 15,  1937.(1)-INSURANCE AGAINST AIRCRAFT AND BOMBARDMENT RISKS.                        (C.I.D. Paper No. 1316-B.)    (Previous reference :  C.I.D. Minutes of the 253rd Meeting, Minute 4.)    THE COMMITTEE had under  consideration  a Memorandum  by  thePresident of  the Board of Trade on the subject of war risks insurance againstdamage to property in this country by enemy aircraft (C.I.D. Paper No. 1316-B).    MR. RUNCIMAN said that the essence of the subject was to  be found inparagraph 5, where it was stated that  it had been estimated that the value ofproperty in the United Kingdom insured against fire risks  was   10,000 million.On the assumption that all owners would be required to pay the extra premium,an annual premium of Is. per cent, (slightly less than the average annual firepremium) would yield  5 million in one year.  An estimate of  possible damageunder present-day conditions put forward  by  the Air Ministry in July  1936(which,  however,  took no account  of the possible effect of incendiary bombs)amounted to a figure of  5 million a day.    These were the dominant facts which had led him to the conclusion that itwould be impossible for the Government  to make itself responsible for any schemeof insurance, and to the recommendation in paragraph 14  of the memorandum that  an announcement should be made  as soon  as possible  on the lines that theGovernment,  after  careful  review  of  all the  circumstances, had  reached theconclusion that no scheme of insurance would be appropriate to the circumstancesof a future war so far as  they could be foreseen to-day.  He understood that theChancellor of the Exchequer was in agreement, and he proposed that he shouldsettle the precise terms of the  announcement in consultation with him.    SIR SAMUEL HO ARE  asked whether the  estimate  of damage given at 5 million a day by the Air Ministry was based on data which could be accepted as reliable.    LORD SWINTON replied that it  had  been  based on the number of bombswhich it was  considered possible could be dropped in an intensive attack.   since it was  manifestly impossible to arrive  at any exact forecast of this number bymathematical calculation, one was  left  with the  broad assumption  that in  anyair attack against this country a proportion of bombers were bound to get through and reach their objectives, and that the damage which these could do would beof such an order as to  make the risks an uninsurable proposition.    THE CHAIRMAN  agreed, and said that for  the purposes of insurance,the possible extent of  damage was  so great  that  it made it immaterial whetherit was calculated on a basis of  5 million or  2 million.    MR. RUNCIMAN agreed that it must  remain largely a matter of opinon as opposed to one of  mathematical calculation.   There was no experience to guide us.    In reply to the Chairman, MR. CHAMBERLAIN and MR. RUNCIMANagreed to draw up the precise terms of the  Government announcement which itwas proposed to make.      [15020-1]
2    In  reply to the request of the Chairman that he should set up an official committee to consider what preparatory work could be put in hand in time ofpeace in anticipation of a compensation scheme in time of war, MR. RUNCIMANrequested the guidance of the Committee of Imperial Defence as to its constitution,and the work which it should do.    MR. CHAMBERLAIN considered that a basis  for the Terms of reference of this  Committee was contained in paragraph 15 of the Memorandum,  whichsuggested that it could consider the possibility of providing machinery forrecording, so far as practicable, the extent of damage as it occurred and how far it would be necessary to  provide a moratorium for persons unable to meet their obligations as a result of the destruction of their property.    THE  CHAIRMAN  agreed,  and considered that  the Committee shouldcomprise representatives of the Treasury, Home Office, Board of Trade, Ministryof Health and the Office of Works.    -SIR MAURICE HANK.EY requested that, in setting up this Committee,the President of the Board of Trade would allow a member of the Secretariat ofthe Committee  of Imperial Defence to be associated with it as  Joint  Secretaryfor purposes of liaison.    MR. RUNCIMAN agreed.                               CONCLUSIONS.    THE COMMITTEE OE IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed     (a)  To make the following recommendations to  the.Cabinet :-           -(i) that  under the  conditions  of a future war, so far as  they can be                 foreseen to-day, insurance against air risks on land, either in                 time of peace or on the outbreak of war, is impossible;          (ii)  that the only practicable course, therefore, is to assume that the                 Government of the  day  will  make  available to owners  of                 property  such compensation as may be practicable  in the light                 of all the circumstances of the time;         (iii) that an announcement, of which the terms should  be drawn up by                 the President of the Board of Trade in consultation with the                 Chancellor   of  the  Exchequer,  should  be made  as  soon  as                 possible on the lines that the Government, after careful review                 of all the circumstances, have reached the conclusion that no                 scheme of insurance would be appropriate to the circumstances                 of a future  war so far as they can be foreseen to-day;  if the                 conditions  arise  which  any scheme  of insurance would  be                 designed  to  meet, it will be for the Government of the day to                 consider making to owners whose property has  suffered damage                 such compensation as may be possible in the  light of all the                 circumstances of the time.    (&amp;)  that if the above announcement is  approved by the Cabinet            (i)  an official Committee should be set up by the President of the                 Board of Trade, consisting of representatives of the  Treasury,                 Home Office, Board of Trade, Ministry of Health and the Office                - of Works, to consider what preparatory work could be usefully                 put in hand in time of  peace in anticipation of a compensation                 scheme in time of war, and to be  responsible for getting that                 work done;          (ii)  the  Committee should  have authority to consult  confidentially                 representatives of outside interests as may be necessary;         (iii) that  a member of  the Secretariat of  the Committee  of Imperial                 Defence  should  be associated  with the Committee as  Joint                 Secretary for purposes of liaison.         *          *           *            *        ...  *      ,   *    2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,           April 15, 1937.
       . Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   April 1937.SECRET.                                                        Copy No. 1001316-B.               COMMITTEE  OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.                WAR RISKS INSURANCE.DAMAGE  TO PROPERTY IN THIS COUNTRY  RY ENEMY  AIRCRAFT.             (Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 1052-B.)            Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.    THE Committee of Lloyd?s in October last decided to follow the example ofthe insurance  companies in  refusing to accept further insurances against war risks on land in this country.  As  a result, apprehension has been expressed byproperty, owners and merchants with regard to their position on an outbreak ofwar and their  fears have been voiced  both in Parliament and &quot;the Press.  I havereceived representations from a number of bodies, e.g., the Corn Trade Associa-tion, the Liverpool Cotton Association, the Federation of Property Owners, andthe London  Chamber of Commerce, in favour  of the institution by the Govern-ment forthwith of a scheme of insurance.  They say that if a small premium werecharged at once it would be possible gradually  to accumulate a fund from which compensation would ultimately be payable, and they also urge that the institution of such, a scheme would give a sense of security calculated to diminish the danger which might otherwise arise that stocks of essential goods held in the country intime of peace  might be reduced below a safe level.  So far,  however, as I havebeen able to ascertain, there is no evidence that supplies are being diverted or thatthe Banks or  other financial interests are curtailing their  facilities to  tradersbecause of the absence of insurance facilities.  I have,  however, been urged to announce the intentions of the Government in this matter as soon as possible, andI think this should be done.    2.  An insurance scheme might take one of two forms.  Either  (a) the scheme would be prepared in peace and brought  into operation on the outbreak of war,or (b) a premium could be collected  in time of peace, with a view to building up a fund for use if war should come.   The latter type of scheme has been suggestedby the various groups that have made representations to me.Insurance in tim.e of war.    3.  A Government scheme for the insurance of property against damage fromhostile aircraft was brought into operation during the Great War.  In return fora comparatively small premium the Government were able to provide compensa-tion  to those  whose property  was damaged.  The scheme was voluntary and eventually showed a profit to the Government.    4.  A Board  of  Trade Committee  consisting of  representatives  of  theDepartments concerned and the insurance interests, has worked  out  a  similarscheme of insurance.  This scheme,  subject to the settlement of one or two details,could be put into operation at very short  notice, if the occasion should  arise.  Aprovision is included that persons owning property not exceeding   200 in valueshould in  any  case be compensated without payment of premium.  The position has, however, changed so radically since the last war that the Committee came tothe conclusion that in a war with a major neighbouring power, any such scheme.of insurance would be impracticable.      [15002]
    5.  The increased efficiency of aircraft and of methods of air attack since1914-18 is well known.  Apart from damage from explosive or gas bombs, thereis, in the  opinion of the Air Ministry, a risk of vast damage by fire caused byincendiary bombs.  The  problem is thus one which differs not merely in  degreebut in kind  from the  experiences of 1914-18.  It has been estimated that  thevalue of property in the  United Kingdom insured against fire risks is  10,000million.   On the assumption that all owners were  required to pay  the extrapremium,  an annual premium of one shilling per cent,  (slightly less than  theaverage annual fire premium) would yield  5 million in one year.  An estimateof possible damage under present-day conditions put forward by the Air ministry in  July  1936  (which, however,  takes  no  account  of  the possible effect  ofincendiary bombs) amounts to a figure of  5 million a day.*  This estimate is,of course,  not exact, but it is of such an order, as to show that all property owners would be required to pay an extremely heavy rate of premium.  No doubt ownersliving outside the most vulnerable areas would strongly object to this charge, andmany, if not most, owners within those areas could not afford to pay it.    6.  Moreover, in the event of air attack on anything like the scale envisaged by  the Air Ministry,  it is the view of the representatives of the insurance companies and Lloyd&apos;s that it would be impossible to cope immediately with thevast number of  insurances  that would have to be effected  within a few hours.Thus many owners of property would have suffered  before  they  could effectinsurance.  Subsequent periodical renewals at short intervals would be necessaryto secure  proper  financial control  of the scheme; these would present a furtherconsiderable problem,  as they would entail as much work  on each renewal as  fireinsurance  renewals entail once a year, and this at a  time of depleted staffs andgeneral disorganisation.   Further,  there would  be  a definite danger  of  theinsurance  scheme breaking down if  London or other large towns were to  be evacuated or if widespread destruction in business quarters were to take place.    7.  Mj conclusion is that under  the conditions  of a future war so far asthey  can  be forecast  to-day, insurance in  war  against air  risks on  land isimpossible.Insurance in time of peace.    8.  Arrangements have been advocated in various quarters under which theproperty in question  is insured at a given rate of premium for a certain sumwhich the Government undertake to pay in certain contingencies.  The markethas declined to cover this risk on the ground that it is not an insurable proposition.This is true whether a scheme is sponsored by the market or by the Government,as the risks to be covered are not capable of actuarial assessment.  No one  can say how long it would be before  it was necessary to use the fund or, in other words, when a war will  take place.   Equally, no one can say  how long a war would last.  There is only the rough estimate of  damage amounting to  5 million a day to which reference has already been made.  If the scheme was to be self-supporting, premiums would have to be fixed on the  assumption that  heavy damage might be inflicted at no distant date.  This would lead to the impositionon a compulsory basis  of  an impossibly high rate of premium.   If the rate weremoderate, the fund collected in peace would be but a drop  in the ocean if warwith a neighbouring country came within a short period. A contractual obligationwould be  imposed on the Government which might easily become an impossibleburden on the public finances.    9.  It might, however, be said that  although an insurance scheme may be impracticable in a major European war it would still meet the case of a warwith  a more distant power.  While this is true, the  damage by air in the more distant war would probably be so small as not to warrant the setting up of aState insurance  scheme.   Further, there is always the danger that a war of this sort may develop into a war with a major neighbouring Power, in which case allthe arguments against an - insurance scheme would apply  at  once.    *  A revised estimate of the possible damage has been prepared by the Air Ministry and isat present  before the Home Defence Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence.  Itwill almost certainly be greater than the earlier estimate and is likely to strengthen  the  con-clusions reached in this memorandum.
    10.  I have, therefore, reached the conclusion  that no sort of insurancescheme is appropriate to meet war risks on land by.reference to the circumstancesof a future war, so far as we can forecast them to-day.  I would add that accordingto my information no European Government contemplates an insurance schemeto meet the risk of destruction of property from the air.  Such risks are, I under -stand, covered by the insurance market  in the United States.    11.  I do not imagine that those who are now apprehensive of the futurewould be content with a Government scheme based on  a moderate premium ifthe liabilities of the Government  in war were  to be restricted to the amountcollected.  The property owner  would  then  have no guarantee that he would receive full  compensation and, if  the war came quickly and the  damage wereheavy,  he  would receive very little.    12.  It  must also be remembered that no scheme of insurance will avoid ademand for  compensation from the owners of damaged property.  If the scheme were voluntary, those who had not  insured would not be entitled to compensation under the scheme, but if, as the result of the insolvency of the fund, a heavy burdenwas placed upon the tax payer,  the latter would certainly demand that he, too,should share in  the  compensation.    13.  The only practicable course therefore is to assume that the Governmentof the day will make available to owners of property such compensation as maybe practicable in the light  of all the circumstances of the time.    14.  I recommend that an announcement should be made as soon as possible on the lines  that the Government,  after careful  review of all the circumstances,have reached the conclusion that no scheme of insurance would be appropriate to the circumstances of a  future war so far as they can be foreseen to-day; if theconditions arise which any scheme of insurance would be designed  to meet, itwill be for the Government of the day to consider making to owners whose propertyhas suffered  damage such  compensation as may be possible in the light of  allthe circumstances of the time.    15.  If  an announcement on these lines is approved, I suggest that an official committee should be set up consisting of representatives of the Treasury, HomeOffice, Board of  Trade, Ministry of Health and  the Office of Works  to consider what  preparatory work  could usefully  be  put  in hand in time of  peace  in anticipation  of a compensation scheme in time of war and to be responsible forgetting that work done.   They  could, for example,  consider the  possibility ofproviding machinery for recording, so far as practicable, the extent of damageas it occurs  and how far  it would  be  necessary to  provide a moratorium for persons unable to meet their obligations as a result  of  the destruction of their property.   The   Committee  should  have  authority  to  consult  confidentiallyrepresentatives of outside interests as may be necessary.    16.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer is in  agreement with the  conclusionsof this memorandum and I should propose to settle the precise terms of any public announcement in consultation with him.                                                  (Initialled)       W. R.Board of Trade, April 12, 1937.
