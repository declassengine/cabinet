Printed for the Cabinet.  April 1937.SECEET.                                                         Copy No.CP. 109 (37).CABINET.MAINTENANCE OF ORDER IN PALESTINE.           Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    I CIRCULATE, for the information of my colleagues, the text of a Secretdespatch (Annexure I) which I have received from the High Commissioner forPalestine, regarding the*&quot; present situation in Palestine and the measures whichhe is taking  for the maintenance  of order, together  with a paraphrase of mytelegraphic reply (Annexure II).                                                (Initialled)      W. O. G.    Colonial Office, April 2, 1937.                               ANNEXURE I. (Secret.)                           - Sir,                                                       March 27, 1937.     1 HAVE the honour to report on the present situation of public security in Palestine.     2.  A general decrease in the feeling of security of person and of  property has occurred in large areas of Palestine during the last six weeks.     This is due not to the recrudescence of large bands of  armed men but mainly to the action of small  parties of bandits attacking  law-abiding citizens in  the country districts, and of anarchists who have shot or thrown bombs in the towns.     It is  also due to the failure of police in effecting arrests, a failure which inevitably causes  alarm throughout  the  country,  and   is in  itself   a direct encouragement to all lawless people.     This feeling of insecurity is  further increased by the continuous growth of bitterness  and inter-racial feeling leading in many  places to a  definite boycott both by Arabs and by Jews.  The Arab and Jewish Press have in many instances tended to increase the general nervousness.     3.  The failure in detection of  crime is  due to two main causes.  The first is the inherent difficulty either  in catching  anarchists who suddenly  shoot or throw bombs in a crowded street;  or to arrest those evil-doers who raid cattle or burn crops and do not hesitate to shoot or murder in order to effect their purpose; this becomes doubly difficult in a countryside where the Arab population is in general sympathy with the criminal rather than with an alien Government.    The second cause is the fact that the Police have been  subject to a period of great  and  continuous strain  and overwork during  the past ten  months,  and further that the strong National feeling existing throughout the Arab population has had inevitable effect, direct and  indirect,  on&apos;the efficiency and wholehearted activity of the Arab Police.   Perhaps  the most marked effect  of this is  the deterioration in the value of our Intelligence Services.    4.  Generally speaking, purely Arab centres, such as the towns of Gaza andBeersheba,  of Ramleh and Lydda, Nablus and Acre, are now  quiet, and  this applies to purely Arab districts around them.  Whereas the troubles are greatest,both in town and country, when Jew and Arab live in close  proximity.       [14932]
2  -.&apos;  Consequently, crime and  afeeling1 of-insecurity  are&apos; most marked in the district of Galilee, which includes Safad, Tiberias, Beisan, Nazareth, and in the: rural&apos;-area; oT  Acre;   The number of murders and criminal acts with  violence committed in Galilee from the 1st January to mid-March are 7 and 39 respectively.     5;   A Governor relies ordinarily on his police force to maintain order.  This duty the;Police have successfully performed Until. 1936.  While the situation is temporarily abnormal we must temporarily adopt abnormal methods..  To  some extent  the inhabitants can be called upon  to defend themselves; in certain  ways the military can be called on to give aid to the civil power.     As our  Police are taxed to the utmost and no further immediate reinforce- ments are available, I put the following proposals forward to General Dill, not with the idea that he should carry them out forthwith, but that he should consider and advise me whether he judged their adoption would be likely to improve the existing situation!     6.   My three suggestions were :        I. That as High  Commissioner  I should hand over the  command of the           Police in Galilee and in the rural area of Acre to the General Officer           Commanding.      II. That Military  Courts should be established in the same region.     Ill, That I should delegate my powers  as  High  Commissioner under the           Defence Order-in-Council  to General Dill in that region.     I said that Proposals I and II should be considered together,  and III as a separate suggestion which might or might not be added to the first two.     7.   On my return from tour I  had a second conversation with General  Dill, and found him very ready to give me assistance in the difficult situation that faces Government during the period while  we await His  Majesty&apos;s  Governmenfs&quot;decisions to be given after consideration of the Report of the Royal  Commission.     General Dill said he was  prepared, of course, to carry out the suggestions I had made should I consider them advisable, but he advised strongly that it would, be far better to carry out all three of my proposals rather than the first two  only.     8.   But for  three main reasons General Dill considered such  action would be  a mistake at the present moment.     General Dill doubted if these proposals would lead to any marked improve- ment in the  situation  in Galilee.  He truly said our fundamental difficulty was to catch the  criminal, and he did not think my proposals would render this task any easier.     He emphasised the opinion I have often expressed, that to make such changes before His Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs decisions were known would be accompanied by  very grave  drawbacks.     He remarked on the difficulties that would be caused if delegation of powers were limited to one area; I pointed out that these difficulties would be  far less in  such a large area as I now suggested  than in much smaller areas  such as Nablus which We had thought of last summer.  General Dill also  thought it would be  a mistake to apply drastic  measures under the Defence Order-in-Council at present if these could possibly  be avoided.     9.   Though I feel that delegation of powers would have a salutary effect all over Palestine, I agree with General Dill  that it  is wise to make further effort. to  restore order in Galilee before adopting my three proposals; we also  agreed if the situation further  deteriorated  and crime in Galilee increased in spite of our efforts,  then  my three proposals  should come into force without delay.  A sudden recurrence of  crime and murder is a possibility.   I therefore  ask that should this happen suddenly, and the  state  of nervousness among Jews of Galilee consequently become more  acute leading  to even  greater  dangers of  serious reprisals, L  may have your approval in&quot;advance for carrying out these three proposals.  General Dill considers he would be able to put them into force  with almost no delay.  You will notice that an advantage of my proposals is to place the whole of our Northern Frontier arid  the most important section of our Eastern Frontier under the control of the General  Officer  Commanding.     10.   Turning again  to the immediate situation, neither the Civil Administra- tion nor the Police are capable of making greater effort than at present, and I said frankly to General  Dill I  felt  I must ask the Army to give more assistance
now than I had from them before I went to England early last February.   Thisperiod before His MajestyV;Governments decisions are announced is a period,of anxiety to Government.  The Police are over-taxed, training fresh vecruits. is.a slow process, yet the Army is giving but little assistance.     I  mentioned as an example the fact that he had a few clays ago told the inspector-General that the -Army could no longer continue giving-assistance tothe police in road patrols.- General Dill at once said if I felt this was necessary;he would immediately give orders for the continuance  of these patrols by-the&apos;Army; and We agreed that I should consult the Inspector-General further as to;the specific ways in which the Army could further relieve the Police and T would:find General Dill ready to give all assistance in his power.     11.  In reply to my  question, he said he had read  the copy of your Secretdespatch dated the 15th March, 1937, dealing with the relations between the HighCommissioner  and  the General Officer Commanding, and added that he fully;agreed with everything in it.     12.  I was pleased to learn from all sides during my tour that there has been less crime and the feeling of insecurity has grown less acute during the last week or ten days.     The appeal of the Higher  Committee condemning  acts  of violence becausesuch are contrary to the policy of the three Arab Kings;  the commutation by meto imprisonment for life  in  place  of death sentences in the  case of seven menconvicted some five months  ago   (in  this connection  the telegram  from HisMajesty&apos;s Minister at Jeddah to the Foreign Office of the 24th March, 1937, isof interest); also the promulgation of the new  Defence Order-in-Council, are  allcontributory causes to this improved state of affairs.     But such temporary  improvement and such slight  causes are ho  basis forcounting on a permanent reduction in crime.  Indeed, with harvest approaching i fear a possible recrudescence of incendiarism, such as occurred last year in Galilee.     13.  I have therefore decided on the following measures :-     (1) Extra  patrolling  by Military, and further  assistance by army in other           directions.     (2) Imprisonment of large numbers of bad characters under the Prevention           of Crime Ordinance.     (3) Extension of normal police patrols and  formation of a body of 50 mounted           police in Nazareth.     (4) The  issue  of a new Defence  Regulation empowering  police to billet           themselves on  villages guilty of refusal to assist police.     (5) Embodiment of large numbers of supernumerary constables, especially in           Galilee.     (6) Strengthening of the Administration  in Galilee by at least one senior           officer.     (7) Should additional crime  make  it. necessary, action  under the  Defence           Regulations, such as collective fines, demolition of houses, &amp;c, will be           taken, possibly accompanied by the imposition of forced  labour and           the re-establishment  of  detention camps.     The promise of full and ready assistance by the military which General Dillgave me last night,  and the clear wording of your despatch dated the 15th March,will be, I trust, of far-reaching effect.  It will enable  our over-taxed police tobe relieved of certain  duties which are only&apos;needed  under the present quiteabnormal conditions, and will, I  hope, bring about a more perfect co-ordination of effort between the Administration, army and police.     Consequently, I view the situation in Galilee with somewhat more confidence to-day than I was able to do a week ago.                                         I  have,  &amp;c. .        . i  ,   ,, ,              (Signed)      A.

US 1Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State to the High Commissioner for                &apos; Palestine.   Despatched April 2, 1937, 3  p.m.(No. 193.   Secret.)     REFERENCE your despatch of the 27th March, Secret, A.   I  am glad to learn of the relaxation which has supervened in the feeling of insecurity; andthe further steps which you have decided upon as set out in paragraph 13 of yourdespatch have my cordial approval.I     I am prepared, with reference to the three proposals described in paragraph 6tto give my approval in principle to their being put  into force should they bejustified according to your judgment by  another deterioration in the general position.   In the first place, however, I should be glad to  be informed precisely what functions  the  General  Officer  Commanding would in those  circumstancesreceive from you.  You appear to suggest that you would, under  the Order-in-Council, Section 6, delegate  all your functions to him.  In that  case, the fullexercise by him  of such functions would appear  to render possible the completesuppression in the area in question of the Civil Administration.ANNEXURE II.
