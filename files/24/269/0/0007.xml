Proposals as to British Policy.Memgran.dumJoy the Lord President of the Council.         In accordance with the proposal made in CP.  12(57)  and approved by the Cabinet at Its meeting of 20th January,  (Cabinet Conclusions 2(37) Conclusion 5), invitations  have now been issued by the League Secretariat for an  International Sugar Conference to be held in London in  April.    A number of acceptances have been received and  it has  now been&apos; definitely arranged that the Conference  Is to open here on the 5th April.    It is, therefore,  necessary to consider what should be the policy of the  United  Kingdom delegation on certain questions which  are likely to arise.    The following proposals have  been  discussed and agreed with my fellow-members of the  United  Kingdom delegation and are  now submitted for  Cabinet approval.  2.      British policy in  regard to a world agreement  on sugar was first defined at the  World Monetary and  Economic Conference  in 1953.    His Majesty&apos;s Government  in the  United Kingdom then declared themselves in  sympathy with the  principle  of an  agreement for the  regulation of production  and marketing  of sugar, and  they proposed the  following basis  for such an agreement:       (a)   for countries which produce  some  sugar but       import  a  substantial  part of  their  requirements,       an undertaking to limit  home  production;       (b)   for  countries ?/hich produce substantially       enough  for their  own  consumption, but  do not(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT. )
     normally export, an undertaking not to expand     production beyond the requirements of the home     market and not to export;     (c)  for exporting countries not already parties     to the Chadbourne Agreement, an undertaking not     to increase their exports of sugar above their     present level;     (d)  for the Chadbourne countries an undertaking     to&apos;continue a limitation of exports and production     on the lines of-the Chadbourne Agreement during     the currency of the new scheme;     (e)  for countries which at present produce no     sugar, an undertaking not to stimulate the     commencement of production artificially.3.     These bases were approved in principle by theSub-Committee of the Conference on sugar and in due course by the full Conference.4.     At the preliminary Conference held in March 1934His Majesty&apos;s Government declared that they stilladhered to these principles, and presumably they remain the general basis upon which we should like to see anagreement framed, with such modification of the formulaeproposed in 1933 as may be required to meet changed circumstances.   I suggest that the object of theConference can now be defined as to secure an inter-national agreement for the maintenance of a reasonable balance between supply and demand on the world marketby undertakings     (a)  on the part of countries which do not at     present export to the free market (whether importers,     self-sufficient or exporters to a preferential market
 that  the-;&apos;&apos; v/ill regulate  their production or exports  so  as to maintain the free ;.iarhet at as high a  figure as possible;      (&apos;b)  on the part of countries supplying the free  market? that  they will regrilate their exports so as  to keep supplies to a level appropriate to the probable demand;      (c)  on the part of all countries? that they will  avoid  the  stimulation to new production which might  result fro..;  improved prices by adjusting protective  duties? subsidies? etc.? as and when prices rise. 5.   As  regards the application of these principles to the production  of sugar in the United Kingdom and in the British Colonial Empire? it has now been decided  as a matter of internal policy to limit to an  amount of 560?000 tons of white sugar per annum the quantity of home produced sugar to be assisted by subsidy.   For  the Colonial Empire it was proposed in. 1955 that the aggregate exports from all colonies should be limited to a figure&apos; arrived at by adding up previous maximum exports from each individua Colon;/- in any recent year.    The aggregate so arrived at in 1953 was 84-2? 000 tons? but it was stipulated that the Colonial  Empire should be allowed a gradually increasing production reaching 950?000 tons in five years from  the beginning of any scheme. With a small adjustment of the initial figure due to later statistics being available? these figures were adhered to in 1934.     Neither in 1955 nor in 1954 were Dominion Governments committed to anyparti cula r figure.
6.     In July 1935 His Majesty&apos;s Governmentannouncedj in connection with the statement of theirpolicy in relation to the home industry, their intention of inviting Governments of sugar-exportingDominions and Colonies to examine with them thepossibility of a joint endeavour to re-openinternational negotiations.   -It was then felt that,provided the other countries were prepared, in theinterests of a general agreement, to make reasonablesacrifices, some concession should be offered on thepart of the British countries concerned.   The figureat which it had been decided to fix the maximumUnited Kingdom production was estimated to be 7 percent, below peak production in this country, and itwas, therefore,  proposed that similar reductions fromthe peak figures should be accepted by the Dominionsand Colonies.    As some compensation (apart from theadvantages of an International Agreement itself)the United Kingdom Government expressed itself asprepared to agree to stabilise existing sugar&quot;preferences for a fixed period of five years,  ifthese obligations  were assumed in an international agreement.    The Dominion Governments and theSecretary of State for the Colonies on behalf ofthe Colonial Empire in due course indicatedacceptance of these proposals.
The 7 per cent,  reduction proposed was never communicated toany foreign countries concerned, being intended to be keptconfidential until an appropriate stage in the Conference, but,it leaked out in the South African press and is fairly widely known.7.     A difficulty has since arisen in connection with theseproposals because the conventional basis adopted for the eon-version of raw sugar to white sugar for statistical purposes,as applied, to United Kingdom production, has been changed from96^o to 94o $%*    As a result of this change, the limit to united Kingdom production of the equivalent of 560,000 tonsof white sugar represents an actual reduction from peak pro-duction of not 1% but 5. &amp;?L    The Dominions and Colonies may therefore claim that the reduction to be applied to them.shouldbe only 5. 6%.   On the other hand, the United Kingdom peak pro-due tion was attained in 1934/35 and no expansion has been allowed since, while production in the Dominions and Colonieshas gone on expanding since that year.   It is important thatthe Dominions and Colonies should not think that we are seeking to iiipose upon them a greater reduction than we have ourselvesaccepted and it is suggested that the whole position should be explained to them and that they should be asked to accepteither a reduction, of 5. 6% on their peak exports up to 1934/35or a reduction of 7% on their peak exports up to date.   this latter proposal would be the more favourable to Australia andto the Colonies.8.     If the above proposal is accepted, the Colonial quotawould be based on their peak exports, up to 1936, which amount to 1,008,000 tons.-   A reduction of 7c/o on this figure would give them an export quota of 937,000 tons i. e.  areduction of 71,000 tons from the present peak figure.(Their peak figure up to 1934-/35 was 954,000 tons, and areduction of 5.-6$ on this would give a quota of 901,000tons only).    Definite figures for the Dominion exports for1936 are not yet available.
 9*      It was  contemplated that other British countries would he affected  as follows:      (a)   India has indicated a willingness to undertake      not to  export sugar during the term of an International      agreemen to      (b)  Canada would be asked to refrain from special      measures  intended to stimulate her comparatively small      production of beet sugar, so maintaining her purchases      from other countries,,      (c)  The  Irish Free State, which is aiming at complete      self-sufficiency in sugar, has been by tacit consent      ignored and is not of great importance one way or      the other^      (d)  Other parts of the Empire, including New Zealand      and Colonies  not at present important producers of      sugar would be asked to refrain from any Government     measures  for  the stimulation of sugar production..  In      fact, we  understand that the New Zealand Government      (which will not be represented at the Conference) are&apos;      contemplating the creation of a sugar-beet industry,      and probably  the most that can be secured from them     would be  an assurance that, during the period of any      agreement, their production would be limited say, to      20,000 tons.&apos; 10.    As regards  other countries,  we should still contemplate that non-exporting countries would agree tomaintain substantially the status quo and that exporting countries,  that is substantially the former Chadbourne countries plus Santo  Domingo and a  few minor exporters,  would agree to split up between them the  available world market.in certain established proportions,  presumably based  in the first place more or less on their present rate of  exports.                         -6-
 11.      In paragraph 4  above  are  set&apos; out  certain  objectives for  the  International Sugar Conference;   it is suggested, inter  alia,  that  the Conference should aim at securing undertakings &quot;on  the part  of  all  countries that they will avoid  the  stimulation to new  production which might result .from Improved prices by adjusting protective duties, subsidies , etc.,  as ana when prices rise&quot;.    This is in accordance with the Statement of Policy  of His Majesty&apos;s Government of July, 1935,  (Cmd. 4964).   It was  there stated that &quot;the  Government believe  that  the sugar producing countries  can only hope to set the industry upon an economic basis by means of an international agreement for the adjustment of supplies to  the requirements of the world market, accompanied by the  acceptance of theprinciple  that State assistance, in whatever form, should everywhere be diminished as market conditions improve&quot;.    It is, however, desirable to consider in exactly what form  this principle can be applied to the UnitedKingdom itself ana its Colonies.   (a)   So far as the United Kingdom  is concerned, the domestic policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government as embodied in the  Sugar  Industry (Re-organisation) Act, 1936, is already, as  stated in the White Paper of 1935,  in full accordance with this view, since the direct assistance from the Exchequer to the United Kingdom sugar industry is directly related to the world priceof sugar, and diminishes as that price increases.   If,however, the price of sugar should rise to such apoint that the whole of the direct assistance to the industry had vanished, there would remain the indirect assistance afforded by the margin between the excise duty and the import duty on foreign sugar,
 which it is  not  at present part of His Majesty&apos; s Government1 s policy to reducea That contingency is unlikely to arise, since it is not proposed to  aim  at  a price exceeding 8/- per  cwt., and the Exchequer assistance to the  sugar industry would  not  in the present  conditions vanish completely until the phbice  reached 9/9.   It may, however, he desirable to qualify the undertaking so  as to cover this  possibility.    (b) As regards Colonies,  they are assisted by  the  general Imperial preference  of  3/9 per cwt. and the special preference of  a  further 3/- per cwt.    The latter is subject to  reduction when  the  world price of sugar rises above certain limits, a reduction in these limits being at present under  discussion between  the  Treasury and the Colonial Office.   (If the proposals now made  are approved a reduction of the preference will commence  when the price reaches 6/6 per cwt., and it  will entirely  disappear at 8/- per cwt.).   The general Imperial preference applicable to both Colonies and Dominions  is not. however,  subject to  any such reduction, and it would  in fact be proposed  (see paragraph 12 (3) below) if an International Agree- meht  is  reached, to  give a. pledge to Dominions and Colonies to continue  this preference for the period of any Agreement. Substantially the same position exists here, therefore, as in relation  to  the United Kingdom industry;  that is, a part of the assistance is subject to revision if prices rise,  but the remainder is noto      It.is probable,  however, that if any such undertaking-to reduce particular duties,  etc.,  is accepted by other countries, it will be subject to some proviso as to a reasonable minimum of protection, and it should be possible to frame such aproviso  so as to cover the continuance of the excise protection in the United Kingdom and the ordinary Imperial preference granted to Colonies.

(b) As regards Colonies,  they are assisted by  the  general Imperial preference  of  5/9 per cwt. and the special preference of  a  further 3/- per cwt.    The latter is subject to  reduction when  the  world price of sugar rises above certain limits, a reduction in these limits being at present under  discussion between  the  Treasury and the Colonial Office..   (If the proposals now made  are approved, a reduction of the preference will commence  when the price reaches 6/6 per cwt., and it  will entirely  disappear at 8/- per cwt.).   The general Imperial preference applicable to both Colonies and Dominions  is not, however,  subject to  aaiy such reduction, and it would  in fact be proposed  (see paragraph 12 (3) below) if an International Agree- ment  is reached, to  give a pledge to Dominions and Colonies to continue  this preference for the period of any Agreement.

l2o     Assuming  that the  above general scheme is confirmed  certain particular questions require consideration:    (a)  In the  ev^nt of an expansion of consumptionor  of  an expansion  of the  free world market due toother  causes, to  what extent are British countries toparticipate in  such expansion?  The foreign exporting countries  will  presumably  claim that any such expansionshould be  reserved  for them, as they have made very ssubstantial reductions in  their production while empire countries  have  increased their production.-  On the otherhand,  this may  give rise to political difficulties withthe Empire producers (and possibly also with theUnited Kingdom  producers), who may claim that (a) ifthe aggregate quotas of the foreign &quot;exporting countries&apos;have been  increased by any percentage, British Empiresupplies (he United Kingdom production plus. dominion and Colonial exports) should be increased pro rata:and (b) British Empire supplies should also be increasedpro rata with any increase of consumption in theUnited Kingsom  plus Canada.  It is suggested that theUnited Kingdom  Delegation  should put in a claim onthese lines but that they  should be ready to negotiatesome compromise,  e.g. to allow the foreign exporting countries  the benefit of any expansion up to a certainfigure, provided  that once that figure has been reached,the British Empire  supplies should share in any further expansion,   (b)  What sort of -price are we aiming to establish bya Regulation Scheme?  It will be very difficult,  and itis probably undesirable,  to lay down a fixed price whichis aimed at.  On  the other hand,  it will clearly  benecessary  to provide for  an increase of quotas if the              -9-
price  should  rise  to an undesirable extent.  At presentour  super-preferences to the Colonies are reduced if the price  reaches 7/6d. per cwt. and the questionis under discussion whether this figure can be reducedto 6/6d:   the super-preferences would then disappearwhen the price reached 8/-.  On the other hand, itmust be remembered that the United YAhgdom is largelyinterested as a consumer and from that point of view is interested in  keening prices from rising unduly.  Itis suggested  that  a price of 7/- to 8/- per cwt. would best suit  the divergent United Kingdom and Colonialinterests  and that the United Kingdom Delegation should support measures to expand supply at about these figures.   (c)  What  sort  of machinery should be set up tocontrol the operation of the scheme and to vary supplies to meet variations in the requirements of the freemarket and to prevent any excessive rise in price?  Itis suggested  that  a Sugar Council should be set up forthis purpose, whose powers and duties would have tobe settled at the  Conference.   (d)  To what extent, if at all, is the UnitedKingdom prepared to police an agreement by any formof discrimination  against countries which are held notto be playing their proper part in it?  It would notbe possible for us to prohibit imports from, or other-wise discriminate  ag;inr.t, any country, towards which wehave m.f.n. obligations without its consent and anypenal provisions required must be embodied in theagreement and accepted by all countries to which theymight be applied.
 Recommendations; 13c    I  recoranaend  accordingly that, subject always to  developments in the course of the Conference,  the United Kingdom Delegation should be  authorised  to pursue  the following policy: - (l)    His  Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom  should be  prepared as part of an Agreement  in which the other countries accept corresponding  obligations -    (a) to  limit United Kingdom production to 560,000  tons of white sugar per annum;    (b) to  invite Colonial Governments to take the. necessary  action to  limit total exports of  sugar from  the  Colonial Empire to a figure 7 per  cent,  less than the aggregate peak production,  i.e. 937,000 tons:       These  actual figures would not necessarily be  announced in the initial statement of policy by  the United  Kingdon Delegation but  would represent  the  concessions His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to make if necessary  to &quot;reach agreement. (2)   His  Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom (without making any public statement to that effect) should use their best endeavours to persuade the Dominions of Australia andSouth Africa to agree  to the limitation of their exports to a figure 7  per cent,  below their peakexports:        -11-
(3)   In return for the acceptance by the Dominions and colonies of the above obligations. His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould be prepared to guarantee the maintenance9 for theperiod of any Agreement9 of the existing general imperial preference and of the special Colonial preference subjectto a revision of its terms which has been agreed in principle between the Treasury and the Colonial Office:(4)   His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom(again without-making any public statement) should alsoendeavour to secure the acceptance by other parts of theEmpire of obligations of the nature indicated in paragraph above:(5)   Any Agreement should provide for the revision of export quotas as may be required from time to time by anInternational Councils &quot;the constitution and powers of whichwould be defined in the Agreement.(6)   As part of the principles to be followed in the revision of export quotas under (5) above the United kingdom delegation should aim at securing    (a) if and when the aggregate quotas of the foreign    &quot;exporting countries&quot; have been increased by a certain    percentage (to be negotiated) British Empire supplies    (i.e. United Kingdom production plus Dominion and   - Colonial exports) should be increased pro rata with any    further quota increases:    (b)  British Empire supplies should also be increased    pro rata with any increase in consumption in the United    Kingdom plus Canada.                     -19-
(7)   No precise provisions about price should he laiddown in the Agreement hut the United Kingdom delegation should support provisions which would enable supplies to be expanded if the world price tended to rise higher than 7/-to 8/- per cwt.(8) His Majesty&apos;s Government i2i the United Kingdom shouldbe prepared to undertake to reduce (a) the subsidy grantedto United Kingdom sugar producers and (b)  the Colonialpreference on sugars as and when prices rise, subject tothe preservation of a reasonable minimum protections theminimum being high enough to cover the present margin of4s.9do  per cwt. between the import duty and the excise dutyon home-produced sugar and the general Imperial preference of 3s.9d.  per cwt.(9) The United Kingdom Delegation should decline to under-take any obligations designed to enforce the Agreement whichwould be inconsistent with our most-favoured-nationobligationsj, but should be prepared to consider undertakingjointly with other signatories5 to penalise imports of sugarfrom countries which having signed the Agreementssubsequently fail to comply with it.19th March, 1937.Privy Council Office.(Intld.)
