Summary of reports submitted by members  of  the Board     of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in  some  cases with     statistical information from other sources).     OVERSEAS TRADE.  Imports in February at  71,7 m.  were 9.4 m. more than in February, 1936..    Nearly 70$&apos;, of therise was in food and raw materials.   Of the increase of 2.9 m. in manufactured goods, over  1 m* related to non-ferrous metals and manufactures, and over  -j? m. each tomachinery and to oils, fats and resins.  Exports of UnitedKingdom products,  38*6 mv, were  3*5-in. more and re-exports, 6.9 m., were  1,3 nu more than in February, 1936..     EMPLOYMENT.  Employment in February showed a recoveryfrom the seasonal decline recorded in January.   The totalnumber of unemployed persons on the registers at 22ndFebruary - 1,627,845 - was 61,378 less than at 25th January.The main variations werej-London .......South EasternSouth WesternMidlands .....North Eastern- 6,118   North western - 14,337- 1,516   Northern .... -  6,529- 5,943   Scotland .... -  4,584-11,806   Wales ....... -  2,895- 7,650     The estimated number of insured persons aged 16*64 inemployment (excluding agricultural workers) was 11,187,000 -81,000 more than in January and 662,000 more than in February1936.     Employment increased in most of the principal industriesnotably building and public works contracting, the clothingtrades (including boots and shoes), the cotton, general engineering, motor vehicle and aircraft, pottery and earthen-ware, and shipping Industries*   In none of the principal industries was there a marked decline.                            -1-                      .

6j      RAILWAY TRAFFIC.   In  the four weeks ended 28th February railway  traffic  receipts increased by  378,000 (3.45%) compared with the  corresponding period  of 1936,  Passenger traffic  increased  by  3.79%,  merchandise, minerals and livestock by 3,12% and coal, coke and  patent fuel by  3.45%.      SHIPPING.   The Chamber  of Shipping index number of freights (1913 -  100) was 139.15 as compared  with 139.49  in January and 84.02 in February, 1936.   With little tonnage available for immediate employment, any  serious setback in freights is considered unlikely.      SHIPBUILDING. All districts in Great  Britain showed improvement.  The  proportion of berths  idle at the end of 1936  (43%) was   reduced.   The placing of new orders continued and several  important Naval  contracts were  awarded.  Some shipbuilders experienced delay in regard to deliveries of material, particularly  steel.  Prices of new ships are advancing owing  to increased cost of raw materials, higher wages, etc.   Ship-repairing  activity increased.      BANKING.   Money remained comfortable  throughout the month,, despite  the Governments announcement as  to borrowing for Defence, the negotiation by the  French  Government in London of a  short-term  credit of  40 m. bearing  interest at 3-^%,  and the view  in  some  quarters that both long and short- term  interest rates may rise..  Competition for  Treasury Bills was keen,  the rate varying, between 10/4.31d. and ll/3.65d. Money borrowed  against bonds,  com banks other than clearing banks,  however, fetched up  to  \%*   The  price of gold moved between 141/11 d.  and 142/4d. and  the  price of silver           15            &quot;*s between  19  /i6d.  and 20 /16d.  The spot franc rose to 104-g-but the   3 months&apos; forward rate was  at  2^-3 3/l 6  discount..  The dollar was steady  between  4.88^ - 4.89f, with a  slight tendency for sterling to weaken.                           -2-
                                                       70      COAL.    The average  weekly output during  the  13  weeks ended 20th February was 4.75  m.  tons  as compared with 4.78 in  tons in the corresponding period a  year before.    The average number of wage earners employed was slightly more.    Exports in February amounted to 2.61  m.  tons  as compared with 2.58 a, tons a year before.    The chief increases were to  France and Italy.    Markets taking less  included Algeria, Germany and the Irish Free State.      IRON Ai-lD STEEL.    The industry continued  exceptionally busy.    Pig-iron producers were fully occupied making- deliveries against contracts  and some temporarily  withdrew from the market.    Pig-iron&quot; output  (603,700  tons)  was Z% more than in February, 1936, and crude steel production (995,900 tons) was &amp;/c more.    It is expected that  the shortage of scrap will be eased by  arrangements made  between organised steelmakers and scrap merchants.   Export demand improved and efforts are  being made to retain,connections  in foreign uarkets. ...  Exports-..of iron, and steel (200,500 tons).,were .32, 700 tons ;.ore , than in February, - 1936.   Imports were considerably less.      Scotland.   All ..steelworks .vere  fully employed.

Another, blast furnace-began operations. -  . The,demand  for  semi-finished steel  continued unabated.  &apos;  Sheet-makers  were well  employed  on domestic and export orders.       ...                                ...      Sheffield.  , Local  steelworks .were operating close to. capacity.    After a relatively quiet  period  the market for stainless steels again became busy. ,..       . .:           . .,,   .  -Soiith Wales.   Demand further. increased.   The tinplate . industry operated .at nearly ..7.0)-* of  capacity;   the  export. price, exceeded the &quot;official&quot; minimum..  The galvanised sheet market improved..
      ENGINEERING.     Demand  intensified and in most directions  the  industry  operated  at  or near full  capacity. It  is reported  that shortage  of supplies of materials made it  difficult  for manufacturers  to satisfy some urgent requirements;  duty-free imports of machinery under licence  increased  substantially.      Exports  of machinery were valued at  3.46 m. as eompared with  3.40 in. in February,  1936.   Imports,  1.8 m., were  ^  m.  more than a year before,  mainly because of increased imports  of machine  tools.      MOTOR  INDUSTRY.     The  number  of raotor vehicles newly registered in January was 39,144 - 3,153 more than a year before;   the increase  in private cars was  2,240. The production  of  private cars in December was 34,349 (27.7% more than a year  before) and  of commercial vehicles 10,165 (26.9% more).   Exports of new private  cars and chassis  in  February amounted  to 6,140, and  of new commercial vehicles and  chassis to  1,873, as compared with 5,325  and 1,367 in February, 1936.   1,427  complete  new private  cars were imported as compared with 923 a year  ago.      ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.     The  industry  recovered from the slfght  setback recorded in January.   Both output and the  volume  of  orders showed considerable improvement.The  amount of electricity generated by authorised undertakingswas  6.6% more than in February,  1936.      LIGHT  METAL TRAPES.    Activity generally was maintained  or improved.   Some trades were  extremely busy. In  the metal  smallwares  trade the shortage  of labour (especially juvenile) persisted.   Exports  of tools showed a marked improvement compared with  a year  ago,, Conditions  in the  cutlery trade were decidedly better  than a year ago  and  export trade showed improvement.      COTTON.     Activity in both  spinning  and weaving  was well maintained, but there were no signs  of further expansion of export trade.    Average  weekly deliveries of raw cotton                           -4-
                                                    72to spinners were 30.1 m. lbs. as compared with 30.8 ra. lbs.in January.   The spinning industry operated at 79-^%of capacity as compared with 75*3 a year before.   raw cotton prices advanced slightly and spinners&apos; marginsfurther increased.   Yarn exports at 12.6 m. lbs. were1.2 m. lbs. less than in January (a longer working month).Exports of piece goods at 160 m. sq. yds were at aboutthe January level and 9 m. sq. yds. less than in February,1936.   Compared with January exports to India increased;the chief decreases were to Australia, British West africa and New Zealand.     SILK AND ARTIFICIAL SILK.     Rasron.   Demand for yarns for the weaving tradecontinued satisfactory, most sections being fairly busy.Demand for staple fibre remained fairly steady.   Thehosiery and underwear trades showed some improvement...  Thefashion for cheap light-weight woollens continuedadversely to affect the sale of plain rayon fabrics. Exportsof yarns and tissues showed marked increases over February,1936.     Silk.   There was a seasonal decrease in demand forplain fabrics..   Demand for fancy fabrics was greater than usual, due probably to the Coronation.     WOOL.   Activity declined.in all sections except heavywoollen weaving.  Raw wool prices fell.   Exports of topsand yarns were lower, but of tissues slightly higher, in value than in January.   Reports indicated a maintenanceof new business in heavy woollen goods;  some shrinkagein demand for the lighter woollen and mixed goods and worsted cloths;  and more enquiry for worsted yarns.     HIDES AND LEATHER.   Prices of South American hidesrose sharply and world prices were distinctly higher than amonth before.  Demand for sole leather fell off.  Box andwillow calf tanners were still unable to obtain prices fortheir leather Commensurate with the cost of raw materials.Business in side leathers was disappointing, in sheepskin                          -5-
 leathers fairly active, and in fancy leathers active.     CHEMICALS.  Home and export sales of alkalis were less than in January,  Deliveries of chlorine products were maintained at  a satisfactory level.  Home trade in inaustrial nitrogen products was  rather higher, hut export trade slightly less than a year ago.   Sales of dyestuffs, both for home and export, were greater.   Home sales of sulphate of ammonia still show an increase over last season;  export sales (excluding sales to Spain) increased slightly.  Demand for tar acid was active. Trade in wood distillation products was good and in pharmaceutical chemicals steady. &apos;     RETAIL TRADE.  The money value of retail sales in January was  2.4,% higher than in January, 1936.   (This was &quot;well below the  increases recorded in recent months, but sales in January, 1936, were exceptionally large).   Sales of food and perishables rose by 3.b%  and of other merchandise by 1.4%.  Preliminary returns for February indicate appreciably better results.    ,CANADIAN  TRADE.  The improvement in economic conditions continued in  January.  The index of physical volume of business was  slightly  less than a month before but .10% more than a year before.  Compared with the previous month exports of zinc increased, but nickel and asbestos exports declined. Newsprint production reached a new high point and wood pulp exports increased substantially.  Imports of textile raw materials and  petroleum declined.   The iron and steel industry was more active.    AUSTRALIAN TRADE. The average price for greasy wool for the  first half of the 1936-37 season was 12.8% higher than for the  first half of 1935-36.  2,429,000 bales of wool were received into store from the 1st July, 1936, to the 31st Januaryas  compared with 2,440,000 a year before, the quantity sold or shipped being 1,713,000 and 1,775,000 respectively.  Wheat and flour shipments from the 1st December, 1936, to the 25th February were equivalent to 27.5 m. bushels of wheat as compared with
                                                            7431 m. a year before.  Butler shipments from 1st July,  1936,  to28th February were 51,000 tons as compared with 67,000 tons  ayear before.  Imports of merchandise during January amounted to 9.44 m. (Australian currency) as compared with  10.05 m.  inJanuary, 1936.  Unemployment among trade unionists in  the  last quarter of 1936 was the lowest recorded since the middle of  1929,    SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE.  1936 was a year of remarkable progress which in many spheres exceeded expectations.  Gold mining  showedfurther steady expansion.    Imports in December were 21.8$ greater than in December,1935.  Exports (excluding gold) were 17.2$ less.  shipments of hides and skins increased but sugar and wool exports declinedand maize exports were negligible.  Gold exports were 28.5$ less,but the daily average tonnage of ore crushed was greater thanin December, 1935.  Cessation of Japanese buying caused asetback in the wool market at the middle of the month, but a subsequent limited revival of Japanese interest resulted in aslight improvement.    INDIAN TRADE.  In 1936 imports of merchandise (124 crores)were 11 crores less than a year before;  exports (185 crores)were 25 crores greater and the highest since 1930.  Importsfrom the United Kingdom (48 crores) were 5 crores less than aa year before; exports to the United Kingdom (provisionallyrecorded at  57 crores) were the highest for the last seven years.    SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.    Argentina.  The surplus of exports over imports in Januaryamounted to $173.2 m. compared with $40.6 m. in January, 1936.Imports were 4$ more.  Exports were nearly double and constituted a record.   This was due mainly to very large grain shipments,though shipments of wool, meat and hides also increased.  Grainshipments continued heavy during February.  The livestock market was dull and tne wool market quiet.  Prices of hides were firmer.The maize harvest is likely to be uneven owing to damage byheat and drought.                         -7-                           &apos;           I
7S     Bra,zil, Preliminary returns for 1936 Indicate a surplusof exports over imports much greater than in 1935,  Coffeeshipments were less in volume, hut slightly more in value.Raw cotton exports established a record.  Meat exportscontinued to expand.   Local coffee prices fell sharply during february and despite the Government&apos;s declared intention tosupport the industry, the market remained uncertain.     Chile.  The exchange position in respect of sterling and United States dollars was slightly easier.   The producemarkets were active.   Exports, imports and the export -surplus were all greater in 1936 than in 1935,   Imports fromGermany increased very substantially, while imports from theUnited Kingdom declined,     Colombia.
