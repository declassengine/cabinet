   [This  Document is the  Property oi His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]                     Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1937.SECRET.CP. 96 (37).                                  CABINET.The Results of the Indian Provincial  lections       MEMORANDUM  BY  THE SECRETARY OF STATE  FOR INDIA.    I circulate for the information of my colleagues a table showing in detail theresults of the elections in the Provinces in India.    The  Congress Party have obtained an absolute  majority  in  the LegislativeAssemblies in five Provinces, namely, Bihar, the Central  Provinces, Madras, Orissaand the United  Provinces ;  while in a sixth  Province, Bombay, they have won87  out  of 175  seats.   In the Provinces  where  there  is a large Muslim vote theyhave  not been so successful, though in both  Bengal and  Assam they  form thelargest   single group,  while in  the North-West  Frontier Province  they  are strongly represented.   The Province in which they have met with the least successis the Punjab, and it is of interest to note that  the large non-Congress majority inthis Province is not by  any  means composed entirely of Muslims.  The  unionist party in the Punjab, which won 88 seats, comprises Hindus, Sikhs, Mohammedansand Indian  Christians.  A number of other Hindu and Sikh  seats were won bymembers of the moderate parties who may be expected on a number of matters toco-operate  with the  Unionist Party.  In  the   elections  for  the six legislative councils, Congress did not meet with the same  success as in the Assemblies, but itwill be  seen that in both Bombay and Madras they have won a  majority of electedseats.    It is reported from all Provinces that the elections were conducted in an orderly and peaceful manner in spite of an electorate four to five times as large as formerly.The polling has taken place quietly and the Police had no difficulty in dealing withany minor disturbances  which accompanied the elections.  The  size of the  pollhas in general  been satisfactory.   In the  Central Provinces it is  estimated  that50-75 per cent, of the electorate voted, and  in  the North-West  Frontier  Province72&apos;8  per cent, among males and 72*4 among  females.  A feature of the  electionshas been that women voted freely and in large numbers.    As regards the formation of Ministries, there is no difficultj&apos; in the Punjab, whereSir Sikander Hyat Khan, the leader of the Unionist Party, has been invited and has agreed to form a Government.  I understand that it  is contemplated  that  50 percent, of the Ministerial posts will go to Muslims, while the other 50 per cent, will be distributed proportionatety between  the various communities  represented  in hismajority. In  Bengal  the different Muslim parties are prepared to unite to forma Government,  and can thus command a larger  following  than the Congress.Mr. Fazl-ul-Huq,  the leader of the Proja or Tenant Party, has undertaken to form aGovernment on the basis of a coalition between  his party and the Muslim  League.In Assam and in the North-West Frontier Province  the  position is still uncertain,but it is unlikely that the  Congress will be called upon to form a Government in either of these Provinces.    At the present moment interest centres upon the Provinces where the Congresshas a majority, and in what follows I confine  myself mainly to the position of theCongress.    The  Annual Meeting of  the  Indian National Congress held in December atFaizpur in Bombay  was  a considerable success from the Congress point of view.For the  time  being there was a closing of the ranks, the left  wing agreeing to postpone efforts to realise the fulfilment of their  socialist policy until independencehad been attained, and  the  right wing reconciling themselves  to this  delayedprospect of socialism for the sake  of solidarity on the national issue.    The Congress  Manifesto declared that the purpose of sending Congressmen tothe new Legislatures  would  be &quot;not to co-operate  in any way with the Act butto combat it and seek an end  of it.&quot;  The decision  as to accepting office  was postponed, but the  Manifesto went on to state  that, whatever the decision on thisquestion might be,  the object in view remained the  same the ending of the Act.At the same time the Manifesto pronounced a little illogically in favour of reformsof a far-reaching kind in the economic, industrial and social fields;  for instance,     5894   85 3.37Copy No:
reform of the system of land tenure and  revenue and  rent was promised, and an adjustment of the burdens on agricultural  land,  giving immediate relief to thesmaller peasantry by  the substantial reduction of agricultural rent and  revenuenow paid, by them and exempting uneconomic ^holdings from payment of rent and revenue.  A further bid for the support of the masses was made with promises of ascaling down of  debts and  the  provision of cheap credit; reduced  hours  of workand  improved conditions  of labour ;  old  age, sickness  and unemployment benefits and  other reforms ;  the removal of all sex disabilities and thelprovision of maternitybenefits; while various other inducements were held out to the depressed classes and  political prisoners.   In the course of the election itself there is no doubt that the Congress candidatesexploited to the full the vote-catching possibilities of their programme of economicand  social reforms.   Efforts  are being made by some of  the Congress propagandiststo argue that the  issue of rejecting the Constitution was the main point which theCongress candidates put to  the electorate and that the new Congress  members ofthe Legislatures have received a definite mandate to carry out  that policy,  whetherby means of the acceptance of office or otherwise.   But the facts point unmistakablyin the other direction.   For instance, The Leader, of Allahabad,  an importantIndian though non-Congress paper which  has  in the past been strongly critical ofthe new Constitution, said, &quot;If Congress majorities  are to be deliberately used to force the Governors to use their special powers in order to demonstrate  that thenew Constitution is a sham, it is obvious that  promises were made merely forcatching votes &quot; ; and it seems probable that Congress leaders  will find themselvesin an embarrassing position in the  light of  their election  campaign  if they reject the  opportunity  of taking  office  and  bringing forward  measures  of reform inaccordance with their programme.   In addition to the  attractions of their  election programme, the Congress  owesmuch to the fact  that it is the only Hindu party which  has  a strong and activeorganisation  all over the country.   It is clear too that Pandit  Jawaharlal Nehru,the President of the Congress for the second year in succession, makes a powerful and  widespread  appeal as  a Hindu of outstanding personality and  ability, andfurther that  the magnetic attraction of Mahatma Gandhi influenced  many votes.The Liberals, for all their ability and importance as individuals, have not succeeded in organising popular support.    In Madras the Justice  Party has suffered  from thenatural reaction  against  their  long period  of  office  and also  from a  lack ofpersonality and unanimity among their  leaders.  The landed proprietors have  been divided by personal rivalries and jealousies and do not  seem yet to have learnt thatthey must  rely for  political organisation  upon their own efforts  and not upon themachinery of the administration.   The  orthodox classes have not yet succeeded inassertiug themselves in the field of politics.  There is little doubt that a number ofpolitical aspirants, realising the weakness of the other parties,  adopted the Congress,label as a matter of convenience rather than of conviction, and having thus got intothe Legislatures it is to be expected that  their influence for what it may be worthwill be used  against forcing the issue with the Government.                      f    Mr. Jawaharlal Nehru has summoned a meeting of  Congress representatives  to-take place at Delhi on the  17th March, at which the question of accepting office isto: be  discussed.  The Congress  leaders most closely  associated with the caucus-will undoubtedly try to secure the adoption of a uniform policy to be imposed fromthe  Centre  upon their provincial organisations.   It is clear that Mr. Nehruhimself is strongly  opposed  to the acceptance of office and wishes to  concentrate theenergies of  the  Congress  upon agitation  for economic  revolution and  political independence outside the constitutional field.   He regards the acceptance of  office as the antithesis of non-co-operation and  does not believe in the idea of destroying the  Constitution  from within.   But  many  of  the   Congress leaders,  such  as mr. Gandhi,  Mr.  Rajagopalachari (Madras), Mr. Rajendra Prasad (Bihar), Mr.  Desaiand Mr. Patel (Bombay), Mr. Govind Pant (United Provinces), do not by any meanstake so extreme a view.   At a recent meeting of the Working Committee at Wardhain the Central Provinces, where Mr. Gandhi  has his headquarters, Mr. Nehru andhis; supporters; seem to have been in the minority;  a resolution was passed whichsaid that the Congress adhered to its basic policy  of  non-co-operation with BritishImperialism, except  so- far as the circumstances might require a;  variation; andinstead of pronouncing definitely in favour of a policy of  producing deadlocks, merelydeclared that; deadlocks should not; be; avoided, when they occurred  while  pursuingCongress policy:.  Mr.. Rajagopalachari,. the Madras-leader and the confidant of Mr.
Gandhi, interpreting this resolution, said that while the Congress would not shirkdeadlocks or difficulties that might arise from the  safeguards  provided  in theConstitution, it would not create deadlocks for the sake of bringing the machineryof the Constitution to a standstill.  &quot; Acceptance of office to wreck the constitution is wholly incorrect and does not represent the position of  Congress if it takesoffice.&quot;   The Governor  of  Madras  has lately had several conversations with Mr. Raja-gopalachari, who made it clear that he and  his followers were ready, if not anxious,to take office, but that it would be easier for  the Congress as a whole to agree to office acceptance if they could get a written assurance to the effect that Governorswould not use the  safeguards in the ordinary course  of government business unlessorders to do so were given them by the Viceroy or the Secretary of State.  On my instructions,  Lord Erskine has  told Mr. Rajagopalachari that he could give himno such &quot;guarantee, written  or oral, in  regard to the use of safeguards ; but thatMr. Rajagopalachari could certainly look for his help, sympathy and support if hebecame Chief Minister.  Mr.  Rajagopalachari said that Mr. Gandhi was at presentinsisting on some formula before advising  the  Congress to take office, and he wasvery much afraid  that, if no such formula was forthcoming, it would be unlikelythat Congress would take office  even where they had a majority ;  he deplored  thisso far  as  Madras was  concerned, but said  that they had to consider what course was best calculated to further the objects of the Congress, taking India as a whole.It remains to be seen whether,  as I am inclined to  believe, this attempt to extracta guarantee  as to the  operation  of the safeguards  is  a  bluff.  It is reported thatthe Congress representatives  in the Madras Legislature  have passed a resolutionexpressing the opinion that &quot; it will further the national interests and the Congresscause &quot;in the present situation if the Party accepts  office wherever it is in a clear majority.&quot;  Conversations  between the Provincial  Governors  and the congress leaders have been  taking  place elsewhere,  and  in the  Central  Provinces,  forexample, the Governor has made a statement on the  subject of the use of  special powers, in which he  declares that the advice, energies and good offices of theGovernor will always be at the disposal of Ministers, no matter  to what political party  they  belong,  provided  that their  object  is the same as his the  goodgovernance of the  Province.    The Viceroy and I are in complete agreement  in regarding the issue  as onewhich, so far as the Government is concerned, must be settled in the Provinces, andwe are opposed to anything  of the nature of a negotiation at Delhi between  theGovernment and the Congress leaders which would be designed  to centralise theproblem  and strengthen the authority of  the Congress  as an  all-India  body.Anything of the sort would be opposed to the conception of Provincial Autonomyembodied in the  Act of  1935, and  would be siibversive  of  the position  of theProvincial Governors.   Apart from the  constitutional aspect of the matter., centralnegotiations on this particular issue would create disturbances in  the minds  of  thepolitical leaders  in Provinces where the Congress are not in a majority, espeeiaUyin the Punjab, where a well-organised party under good leadership, mostly, but not entirely, Muslim, has already  accepted the  responsibility of  forming a Government.    In the course of:  the  conversations between Mr.  Rajagopalachari  and  LordErskine the  question of a meeting between Mr. Gandhi and the Viceroy was  raisedby the former.   I have  told Lord Linlithgow that if Mr.  Gandhi  asks  for an interview I should myself see no objection  to his granting it, but I have urged thatif Mr, Gandhi  asks  for assurances on the  subject of the  special powers  of  the governors, an announcement  should be made without delay after  the interview hastaken  place,  stating the nature of the proposals and the impossibility of our giving any guarantee that would restrict or  limit  the responsibility imposed  upon  the governors by the  Act and by their Instruments of Instructions.    The dilemma is one for the Congress rather than for the Government and thereis no  occasion for  us to help  them out of their difficulties.  The general  line  ofGovernment policy is clear and straightforward, and if, contrary to expectation andto  what  we should  desire, the Congress  Party in  any or all of the Provinces  inwhich  they have majorities  refuse to accept office and no other  stable Govern-ments can  be formed, the  Act of 1935 makes provision for the situation whichthen arises.    I am reporting the situation for the information of my colleagues and  there isno question  of policy which I desire to raise for consideration.12th March 1937.Z.
