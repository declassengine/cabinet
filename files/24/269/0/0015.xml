Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    IN accordance with Conclusion 9 (c) of Cabinet Conclusions 1$ (37) of the24th March, 1937, I circulate to my colleagues the following papers showing thepresent position as regards the question  of the release of  Belgium from herobligation to render assistance to France under the Treaty of Locarno and the text of Proposals of March 1936 :-    1.  Minute  by  Sir O. Sargent  covering a memorandum from the  French          Ambassador, dated the 20th March, 1937.    2.  Despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Paris covering a memorandum          handed to  the  French Ambassador  in reply on the 24th  March, in          accordance with the Cabinet Conclusions of that date.                                                                   A.  E.    April 1, 1937.                                  No. 1.             Minute to the Secretary of State by Sir Orme Sargent.    WHEN handing me this note on the 20th March, the French Ambassadorexplained that as the opinion which he had expressed to you on the 18th Marchwas personal, he had asked the Quai d&apos;Orsay  whether  it represented the viewsof the French Government.   The result has been the present statement  which shows that M. Corbin had correctly interpreted the views of his Government.  TheFrench Government wished you particularly to see this before you had any  con-versations with the King of the Belgians.    M. Corbin added the following three stipulations :      (1) The French  Government hoped that there would be no delay in making          proposals to Brussels.  In fact, they would like this action to be taken          this week.    (2) In order to use to the full this opportunity for improving Franco-Belgian          relations, the French Government wished  to have the merit for taking          the lead in  initiative in  any  approach  to the  Belgian  Government.          They naturally wanted to avoid the impression that they were being          being forced against their will  to agree to liberate Belgium from the          . provisional arrangements of last March.    (3) When liberating Belgium from the arrangements of last March, it must          be made  clear  in  some way  or other that  these arrangements  still          continue in force as between Great Britain and France.

2                             Enclosure in No. 1.Memorandum communicated, by the French Ambassador to Sir Orme Sargent on -  -  ,                         March 20, 1937.(Translation.)    THE Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has been so good as to inform theFrench Ambassador of  his wish  to see a speedy settlement  of the  question ofBelgium&apos;s position in relation to the obligations by which she is  still bound underthe Treaty of Locarno and under  the arrangement arrived at on the  19th IMarchlast between the signatories of that treaty other than Germany.    The  French Government share this anxiety.  The most  recent information which they have been able to obtain concerning the views of the Belgian Govern-ment has convinced them that that Government  consider that from the point ofview of the interests for which they  are  responsible, it is essential that inter-national negotiations on the position  of Belgium should be set on foot withoutdelay.    The  views  of  the Belgian Government on the fundamental  aspects of theproblem do not  seem to have changed.  They insist on the recognition of Belgiumas a guaranteed and not a guarantor State; they assert that Belgium is readysolemnly  to  undertake  to  defend herself with  all her strength against  anyaggression by land, by sea, or by  air; they intend to adhere to  their obligations as a member of the League of Nations.  On the other hand, they have shown a veryreserved attitude on the delicate question of right of passage,  a question whichis itself bound up with the interpretation of article 16 of the Covenant; and evenif they do not rule out all form of contact between the Belgian, British and french general Staffs,  their attitude to staff contacts  is very circumspect.    In  a  situation of  such  delicacy  the French  Government  attach greatimportance to making  sure  of an agreement between the French and Britishpoints  of  view.  They  note  with pleasure  that the  declarations made by theSecretary  of  State to the French Ambassador  show that he shares their anxietyon this point.  It  is in  this  spirit that they wish to compare the conclusions towhich they have themselves been led with  the views of the British Government.    There is no reasonable prospect at present of a modification  of Belgianopinion which  might allow  the Belgian  Government  to withdraw  from theposition laid down in the King&apos;s  speech.  The  common interest  of  France and england is therefore to  accommodate themselves to this state  of affairs in such away as to derive the maximum advantage therefrom.    Some gesture should therefore be made without delay.  If it were postponedany longer, it would lose a great part of its value.    But in view of certain considerations of fact which concern  the security of western  Europe, and because also of the necessity of preserving the principlesof the common policy of  the British and French Governments, it seems all the more essential that they should make quite certain of  the complete fidelity of belgium to her obligations  as member of the League of Nations, in that the Governmentof M. van Zeeland  continue to express the most disquieting reservations regardingthe scope of article 16 of the Covenant.   The French  Government,  moreover,consider  it of the utmost importance  that  the  possibility of maintaining  staffcontacts  with  Brussels should  be  preserved.   These  contacts   are,  in  fact,indispensable if the guarantee which will be given to the Belgian Government isto have any real  efficacy, and it  would,  in any event,  seem to  be possible toarrange them with the necessary discretion.    Once agreement has been reached  with the British Government on theprinciples upon which the negotiations should be based, the French  Governmentwould  not for  their part have any  objection  to initiating negotiations withBelgium as soon as possible.  A few days ago  it might have been  hoped that the replies which were awaited from the  German and Italian  Governments to thequestions  put to them by the British Government in their memorandum of the19th November would be of such a nature  as to allow of a  development of thegeneral negotiations. This hope no longer seems justified.    The negotiationscontemplated would, therefore, for the moment have to be limited to the case ofBelgium.    Even if the negotiations were limited  in this way, they  would meet with difficulties of which the  seriousness would depend on the extent to  which it might seem necessary  for all the Powers signatory to the Treaty of Locarno  to take  part
                                  No.  2.                      Mr. Eden to Sir G. Clerk (Paris).(No. 617.)Sir,                                         Foreign Office, March 24, 1937.    THE French Ambassador came to see me this afternoon, when he said thathe wished to speak to-me about the Belgian position.  The French Governmentwere anxious to make progress with negotiations  on the lines  indicated in his memorandum of the 20th March.. I replied that we fully understood the position,and we had done our best to hasten our own observations.  I then handed to hisExcellency the  attached  memorandum.   M. Corbin, after reading  it,  took noexception to any of it, except that we did not apparently propose that the twoGovernments should reaffirm  in express terms  their obligations to Belgium.  Hethought that such a reaffirmation might be a useful cloak for any Staff conversa-tions finally necessary later on.  If, for instance, we  reaffirmed our existing obliga-tions we could perhaps say that the modalites for giving effect to them would laterbe discussed if  desired by the Belgian Government.    2.   After  some further  conversation we agreed that the best &quot;means  for making progress now would be for the French Government to prepare the draft ofthe suggested communication to the Belgian Government.                                                 I am, &amp;c.                                                     ANTHONY EDEN.                            Enclosure in No. 2.  Memorandum handed to the French Ambassador by the Secretary of State.    HIS Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom were grateful to receive from the French Ambassador on the 20th March a statement of the views of theFrench Government on the problem raised by the desire of the Belgian Govern-ment to be liberated from the obligation to render assistance to France which was undertaken  by Belgium  under  the Treaty  of Locarno and  which  Belgiumrecognised in Section III Of the Text of Proposals of the 19th March, 1936, assubsisting in its entirety.    His Majesty&apos;s Government have given  careful consideration to the analysis of the  problem contained in M. Corbin&apos;s communication  and to the proceduretherein suggested for its solution, and they  have certain comments to submit forthe consideration of the French Government.      T14939]                                                    n in them.  The settlement of these difficulties will be easier if the negotiations areconducted through the diplomatic channel and if the idea of calling a conference is-rejected. Other reasons, and in particular the objections to which this apparentresurrection of  the Four-Power Pact would give rise, cause the French Govern-ment to take a most unfavourable view of the possibility of any such conference.    What most concerns the Belgian Government at  the moment is not so muchto receive immediate guarantees from the Great Powers party to the Treaty of locarno, as to be freed from the obligations of assistance which they  have them-selves assumed,  particularly by the arrangement of the 19th March last, the benefitof ;which France.and England (the case of Italy being doubtful) might be led to claim.   On this-point: a general declaration of the French and British Govern-ments, the terms of which, could be rapidly concerted with the Belgian Government,would  undoubtedly be; sufficient to give the Belgian  Government the immediatesatisfaction: they require,  and would make it possible for the conditions  of acomplete settlement to be given, concrete form.   The elaboration of this settlementmay be a very delicate matter, since the conditions suggested in the last note fromthe German; Government seem at first sight to be difficult of acceptance and likelyto raise serious  objections on the part of the Belgian Government.    The Government of the republic would be very glad to  know whether theabove views meet with the general approval of the British Government.  If theydo, the. representatives  of the  two  Governments in  Brussels might  at  once be instructed to bring them jointly to the attention of the Royal Government.                                                       YVON DELBOS
    In the first place, His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that a clear distinction should be drawn between  the procedure by which Belgium should be liberatedfrom her existing obligations as a guarantor Power under the  Treaty of Locarnoand under the Text of Proposals of March 1936, and the procedure by which, if atall, satisfaction is to be given to the desire of the Belgian Government to enjoy,whether within the framework of a new Western Treaty, or in the event of failure to conclude such a  treaty,  a guarantee different in character from the guaranteewhich she enjoys under the Locarno Treaty.    The second of these problems is one which cannot well be dealt with exceptwithin the scope of the five-Power conversations which are at present proceeding;and as the French Government rightly remark, the latest communication from theGerman Government contains proposals in this regard which the Belgian Govern-ment might find it difficult to accept.  His Majesty&apos;s Government do not wish, inthe present communication, to embark upon any discussion of the merits of thevarious proposals that have been made on this wider and less immediate question,or of the procedure which it might be &quot;found most expedient to adopt.  They willconfine themselves to the urgent problem which is now before  them, namely, thatof the steps to  be taken to give to the Belgian  Government the liberty which itdesires.    His Majesty&apos;s Government are in agreement with the French Government in thinking that a suitable method of giving satisfaction to the Belgian Governmentwould be  by  the issue  of a joint Anglo-French declaration, the terms of whichwould be  settled in  agreement  with the Belgian Government.    His Majesty&apos;sGovernment agree that the preparation of such a declaration should be undertakenas early as possible; and that as soon as its main lines have been agreed upon between Paris and London, a joint proposal should be made to the Belgian Govern-ment by the representatives of the two Governments.    His Majesty&apos;s Government consider  that at the same  time  the  BelgianGovernment should, for their part, be invited to undertake in appropriate form :     1. To maintain their armed forces and other means of  defence in a maximum          state of efficiency;    2. To employ all their military, naval and air forces to defend their frontiers          in the event of  attack against or invasion of Belgium; and to prevent          Belgium being used as a passage or base of operations whether by land,          sea or air for purposes of aggression.    3. To continue Belgium&apos;s membership of the League of Nations  and to abide          by the obligations of the  Covenant.    His Majesty&apos;s Government doubt whether it will  be desirable to  ask theBelgian Government for any further or more precise undertakings than these, andthey would therefore suggest that the French Government should reconsider thetwo conditions which they suggest in their memorandum.    The first of these suggestions is that the two Governments should make quite sure that Belgium  will scrupulously  fulfil  her obligations as a member of theLeague, this being considered essential in view of the reserves which the BelgianGovernment  have formulated from time to time  in respect of article 16 of theCovenant.   His Majesty&apos;s Government would  recall  that in the memorandumcommunicated to the French Embassy on the 18th December last  they expressedthe opinion that the French Government would be well advised to accept, as beingprobably the best that could be obtained, the statement by the Belgian  Govern-ment that,  while Belgium recognises herself  to be bound by paragraph 3 ofarticle 16 of the Covenant as regards the passage of troops across her territory in certain circumstances, Belgium  should in every case be the judge as to when and whether those circumstances had arisen. His Majesty&apos;s Government are stillof the same opinion.     The second suggestion made by the French Government is that the possibilityof maintaining contacts with the Belgian General Staff should be  safeguarded,since these  are indispensable for  the effective operation of the guarantee ofmilitary  assistance given to  Belgium.  His Majesty&apos;s  Government do  notunderrate the importance of this consideration, and would be far from wishing to discourage the French Government from making such arrangements as may bepossible with the Belgian Government in this regard.  They are not, however,themselves in  a position  to require  that  an  understanding  with  the  BelgianGovernment on this subject should be a condition for acquiescing in the release
of Belgium from her existing obligation.  The subject of staff contacts, indeed,seems  to His Majesty&apos;s Government one which would  more appropriately beraised at some later stage, when  the question of the nature and  form of the guarantees to be given to Belgium in place of those now in force  comes underconsideration.     Subject  to  these  observations, His Majesty&apos;s Government  concur  in theimmediate course of action which the French Government propose.  They would only add, in response to a  request made by M. Corbin when communicating his memorandum, that  they appreciate that the release of Belgium from her obliga-tions will not affect the present position as regards the existing obligations ofHis  Majesty&apos;s Government.  They will  be prepared to make this plain in  someappropriate form.     Finally, His Majesty&apos;s Government  think it important to avoid  creating any impression that the course which the two Governments are proposing to adopt inregard to Belgium implies the suspension or failure of the Five-Power conversa-tions.  They would suggest that this should at the appropriate moment be made clear to the German and Italian Governments.  The Italian Government might also  be given an opportunity of associating themselves with the suggested Anglo-French declaration, it being understood, however, that the issue of the declaration would  in no case be made conditional upon their participation in it.
