feBCRETo[pTTll (57)COPY NO.CABINET o                      FILM QUOTA LEGISLATION.        Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.     The Cinematograph Films Act, 1927, expires partly in March,1938, and partly in September, 1938.  The purpose of this Act wasto assist in &quot;building up the film production industry in theUnited Kingdom and elsewhere in the Empire and it carried out this purpose by placing an obligation on renters in the UnitedKingdom to acquire, and on exhibitors to show, a proportion ofBritish films.     In view of the approaching expiry of the Act, I appointed a departmental Committee, under the chairmanship of Lord Moyne, to&quot;consider the position of British films, having in mind the approaching expiry of the Cinematograph Films Act, 1927, and toadvise whether any, and if so what, measures are still requiredin the public interest to promote the production, renting andexhibition of such films&quot;.  The Commit-tee in their unanimousReport (Cmd.5320) find that the Act has been &quot;an important factor in the growth of the British film production industry toits present state&quot; and that all considerations point to &quot;the absolute necessity for legislative action to maintain and establish the industry&quot;.  They do not find any satisfactory alternative to the present method of protection and recommendthat &quot;the requirement of a quota on the renting and exhibitionof British films should continue for a further period of tenyears&quot;.     Hence the main principle of the present Act is approvedby the Committee and there is, in fact, general agreement that
      the quota system is the most appropriate way of supporting the      production of British films and that such support is at present      necessary.  With regard to the method of applying the principle,      however, the Committee make a number of recommendations for      modification which, I have found, are unacceptable to most or      all sections of the trade, and many of which seem to me of      doubtful valueo  They relate to the establishment of a Films      Commission with doubtful functions and status  and to a number      of other matters with which I need not at present trouble my      colleagues,,           I feel that in any new legislation it is desirable to carry      the trade with us as far as possible, as the.success of      legislation of this kind must depend to a large extent on their      good will.  I am satisfied, however, that legislation providing      for the continuance of quotas of British films for renters and      exhibitors for a further period of ten years is necessary and      desirable, and I should be glad of authority to announce that      the Government propose to introduce such legislation before the      end of 19370  If this announcement is authorised, I propose to      institute at once discussions on that basis with the trade      regarding those recommendations of the Committee&apos;s Report which      are the subject of controversy..  I will submit detailed      proposals to my colleagues in due course.                                                WoRoBoard of Trade,15th April, 19370
