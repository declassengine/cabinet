Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    I SUBMIT to my colleagues a memorandum covering reports* of an Inter-departmental Committee on a proposal for a scheme to promote the marketing of Colonial produce in the United Kingdom and overseas.    2.  It  is proposed that the scheme should be  supervised by a Board to becalled &quot; The Colonial Empire Marketing Board &quot; which will consist of :     Secretary of State for  the Colonies (Chairman);    Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies (Vice-Chairman);    Two members of Parliament from Opposition parties;    Five members of the business world, including the marketing side of Colonial        products (this would be increased to six if the Treasury decided in favour        of being represented);    The Head of the Economic Department of the Colonial Office;    One representative of the Treasury;    One representative of  the  Department of Overseas  Trade or  Board of        Trade; and    The Director of the Imperial Institute.    3.  I am advised that the setting up of the Board will not require legislation.The Board will possess executive, and not merely advisory functions, and whileits activities will be closely co-ordinated with the activities in economic mattersof  the Colonial Office, it is proposed that it should have its  own office andsecretariat.  Expenditure for the Board on the basis proposed will probably be ofthe order of  52,000 a year when the full scheme is in operation, but a considerablysmaller amount may be needed in the early stages,  the  annual  requirementsincreasing  as  the establishment and functions of the  Board develop.  It issuggested that  the necessary financial provision for this service should be madein the Vote for Colonial and Middle Eastern Services  (Class II  (9)).    4.  It will be seen from the detailed proposals in the memorandum that full co-operation by Colonial Governments in the work of  the Board may necessitatesome  assistance from United Kingdom funds through the Colonial development fund.  Both in this connection and in order to facilitate assistance to researchprojects, changes in the powers of the Colonial Development Advisory Committeeare suggested firstly, to enable them to consider proposals from bodies other thanindividual Colonial Governments, and secondly, to remove certain limitations onthe scope of schemes which may be assisted from the fund.  An amendment ofthe Colonial Development Act will be necessary for this purpose and a separatenote  is  appended  indicating  more  precisely what  changes  are  proposed.(Appendix I.)                            * Appendices III and IV.

 *   .5.   Accordingly, I invite my colleagues to approve, the proposals for settingup  the Colonial Empire Marketing Board, the necessary financial provision forits functions and the legislation for the amendment of the Colonial Development                                                (Initialled)       W, O. G.!    Colonial Office, Downing Street,          April 21, 1937.  &apos;                                MEMORANDUM.     THE recent past history of Colonial economic development has been one of growing realisation by  His Majesty&apos;s Government  of its  responsibility  for promoting the economic welfare of the  Colonial Empire, but prior to the Great War efforts  in this direction were sporadic and unco-ordinated. !-.:;.:;-. The creation of the Empire Marketing Board in 1926 was the first organised attempt to promote the  marketing of  Empire  produce with the assistance  of Government money and machinery, but the abolition of the Board in 1933 left a gap which it is now desired to fill so far as the Colonial Empire is concerned.     2.  An  inter-departmental committee was accordingly appointed  to consider and report on proposals for promoting the marketing of Colonial produce in the United Kingdom and overseas.  The Committee  was composed of representatives of the-         Colonial Office,         Treasury,         Board of  Trade,         Department of Overseas Trade,         Department of Scientific and  Industrial Research,         Imperial  Institute.  ....-, The following is a  brief resume of its reports :  Establishment of Board.     3.   Colonial Governments and the Colonial Office give considerable assistance to Colonial  producers,  but that assistance  stops  short of  establishing  contact between the  producer in  the  Colonial Empire and the purchaser in the United Kingdom, except in certain restricted classes of cases.  The Committee accordingly recommends  the establishment of Government machinery to promote the better marketing of Colonial  products by a service of Marketing Officers,  publicity, including participation in exhibitions, and research.  It further recommends that those activities could best be supervised by a Board to be appropriately called the Colonial Empire Marketing Board, whose composition is indicated in the covering submission.  The Financial and Economic Adviser and  the Agricultural Adviser to the Secretary of State for the  Colonies would act as regular  assessors to the Board, and a panel of technical and scientific Assessors would be set up to assist on research matters. The Board would require at least a Secretary and Assistant Secretary with adequate typing and clerical assistance. Colonial Marketing Service. r  4.  The  main  business of this service in the United Kingdom would be to make and organise  detailed studies of the marketing systems of Colonial products both in the country of production  and overseas, to acquire and utilise  marketing information and market statistics, and to study  the improvement of methods of preparation  and  collection for sale,  grading and  packing,  and to this  end to maintain contact with distributors, manufacturers and  large users and potentialrisers of- Colonial  products.   It  is thought  that  the  initiation- of  systematic investigation not  confined to the  United Kingdom of methods of  marketing of: Colonial produce and the improvement of those methods should be the principal function, of the Board  in its early  stages,  without seeking  immediate directresults from  market promotion and advertisement.  The Board would thereforeneed to send  out its own Marketing Officers or specially appointed investigatorsto conduct special enquiries in the Colonies or even  in foreign countries.  The
  Board would need  to  consider  the promotion  of Colonial marketing  in the  Dominions as well as in the United Kingdom, European countries and the United  States of America.                                                        ^      But its main  function would be to help encourage the producers and distri-  distributors concerned to build up efficient marketing organisations of their own, rather  than to let the Board&apos;s officers become sales agents themselves.  In the organisation  of systematic market surveys the Board  would  seek the assistance of Colonial  Governments in any local investigations  required.  Where  financial difficulties  might  prevent such assistance, it is not contemplated that the Board, although it  might  in suitable  cases loan staff, should make any grants to  Colonial Govern-  ments.  If such grants were required for this purpose, applications might be made  to the  Colonial Development Fund.      5.   The  existing organisation charged with the promotion of marketing of  Colonial  forest products in the United Kingdom, the Colonial Forest Resources  Development, will be brought into close association with the  Colonial  Empire Marketing Board  and its organisation of marketing officers, but it is proposed that it should for the present retain its separate identity and finances, though the possibility of combining the two organisations will be borne in mind.     6.  Ad  hoc investigations arising put of  enquiries and contacts made by Marketing Officers should be  initiated, supervised and  financed by the Board, though the fullest use will be made of and close liaison maintained with existing organisations. Publicity.     7.  Very  conservative  proposals  are suggested  for  advertising,  which, however,  may eventually involve the employment of a special officer, either  part time or whole time.  Greater importance, however, is attached to participation in exhibitions of a suitable nature, and  the  Board should have a permanent exhibition staff. Research.     The Committee considered the question of  research,  exclusive of the ad hoc investigations referred   to above,  which they classified   under   four  broad headings:      (a) Specific production research, that is,  enquiries  into more  or  less  self-           contained problems arising in the production of commodities.     (b) Long-range fundamental production research.     (c) Consumption research into new uses.     (d) Other aspects of  economic research,  including  research  into transport           problems. In some particular commodities (e.g., rubber and  tin) extensive research schemes financed by the industries already exist.  Particular pieces of research as regards Agricultural products are undertaken by an individual Colonial Government or group of Governments, occasionally with assistance from the Colonial Development Fund.  It would,  however, be of value to the Colonial  Empire if the Colonial Development Advisory  Committee could consider proposals from bodies other than  individual Colonel  Governments,  e.g., groups of  Colonies, the Colonial Advisory  Council  on &quot;Agriculture and  Animal Health, the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture, and possibly the Colonial Empire Marketing Board and the Colonial Office itself.  The present difficulties  in regard to long-range  funda- mental production research arise from several factors requiring for their solution in the main  that  this type of research should be undertaken  by some central organisation  having  security of financial provision over a  long period.   The Colonial Development Advisory Committee have  felt some hesitation in recom- mending grants  for research of this character because they have been unwilling to pledge their funds over a long period,  and do not feel able to exercise continuing supervision necessary in such circumstances.  A  further difficulty is that such research may  be of interest to a  number of Colonies,  while grants from the Colonial Development Fund can only be made to a particular Colonial Government.    The Committee has  come to the conclusion  that the Colonial DevelopmentAdvisory Committee with  some extension of its powers, would be the most suit-      [15084]                                                    B 2
able body to control and direct long-range research work both on the productionand consumption side, and accordingly suggests (a) that the Treasury should beempowered,  on the  recommendation of  the  Colonial  Development AdvisoryCommittee, to grant assistance to organisations other than  individual colonial governments, and (b) that permanent arrangements should be made for obtainingtechnical advice by the Colonial Development Advisory Committee by;the definiteassociation with its  activities on the research side of scientific and technicalbodies.  &quot;The first  proposal, at least, involves an amendment  of the colonial development Act, 1929.Finance.                      &apos;     The total financial provision which it is expected will  be required for theseveral  activities of the Colonial Empire Marketing Board is as follows :   &apos;                , .          &quot;     .           -  &apos;         &apos;;&apos;         &apos;         (1)  Headquarters   Organisation,   Accommodation,&quot;]               Staff, &amp;c.       ...    ......    ...     ... \   20,000         (2)  Marketing officers ...    ...     ...    ...     ...J         (3)  Ad hoc investigations ( 10,000)......     ...     10,000-         (4)  Exhibitions......    ......    ...     ...     10,000                                                               40,000  .

    AS is stated above, while the setting up of the new Board will not involveseparate legislation, an amendment to the Colonial Development Act, 1929 (a copyof which is appended*), will be required in order that the Committee may have powers, subject to the usual concurrence, to make grants direct to the Board forthe purposes referred to in the Colonial Marketing Committee&apos;s Report.    2.  I am advised that the amendments required will be as follows :     (1) Section 1 (1), line 6:  After &quot; this section applies &quot; insert &quot;or to two or          more such Governments jointly.&quot;    (2) Section 1.  Add new sub-section (2) : &quot; The Treasury may further, with          the concurrence of the Secretary of State and on the recommendation          of the Committee, make advances for the purposes of paragraph (1)          of sub-section (1) to approved bodies other  than the Governments of          any Colony, &amp;c.&quot;    (3) Renumber other sub-sections of Section 1.    (4) Section 1 (1), lines  6 and 7.  For &quot; aiding and developing agriculture          and industry in &quot; substitute &quot; developing.&quot;    3.  At the same time, in order to allow the Committee to make recommenda-tions for assistance from the Fund to schemes for educational purposes which areat present regarded  as beyond the scope of the Act, it is  proposed to) withdraw the statement made at the time of the passing of the Act to the effect that  it wasnot intended to include schemes  of educational development within the  scope ofassistance from the Fund.* Appendix II.

                                REPORT.                            INTRODUCTION.    1.  We were appointed to consider and report upon certain proposals for promoting  the marketing  of  Colonial produce in the  United Kingdom and overseas.    Before we proceed to report in detail  upon them,  however, we think that itwill be convenient if we refer briefly to the background to these proposals.    The history of  the last fifty years or  more of  Colonial economic policy hasbeen one of a growing realization by His Majesty&apos;s Government of its respon-sibility for promoting the economic welfare  of the Colonial Empire, not indeedby eliminating private enterprise, but by supplementing it.  The earliest efforts of the Government were directed to such matters as the formation of agricultural departments in the Colonies and the introduction of new economic crops intoindividual Colonies. The organization of marketing machinery by the promotion of co-operative societies and other similar  devices came a good deal later, and itis fair to say that until after  the Great War any  efforts in this direction weresporadic and unco-ordinated.    The creation of the Empire Marketing Board in 1926 was the first organizedattempt on  a large scale  to promote the  marketing  of  Empire produce,  withthe assistance of Government money and machinery.  The abolition of the board in 1933 left a gap  which it is the purpose  of the proposals now submitted to fill so far as the Colonial Empire is concerned.    While  the functions of the original Empire Marketing Board were mainlydirected to &quot; marketing &quot;,  a great deal of its energies and money were devotedto the promotion of research, as a  stimulus of efficient production, and to tradepublicity as an incentive to the good-will of the consumer; and these two matters are really only different aspects of the same &quot; marketing &quot;  problem.    The object  in  view is to promote the  economic interests of the  colonial empire in the broadest way, that is to help  the individual to raise his  standardof life by producing more  and better articles and  so increasing his income andhis purchasing power.  The Government can, and&apos; to a large extent alreadydoes, assist the individual at almost every stage in this programme. Many aspectsof the work are already covered by existing Government agencies; but in marketpromotion and in research it appears to us  that there are gaps in  the existing machinery  which could with advantage be  filled.   We  accordingly group our recommendations under these two heads.    Our report was shown in draft to the  Colonial Development Advisory Com-mittee, since certain aspects of our enquiry were of special interest to that body.They  are most particularly concerned with our proposals under  the head  of research, but  they  have stated that the  general object  of  the scheme set outhere has their strong sympathy and support  and that, on the information beforethem, our recommendations appear to be well-founded.                          RECOMMENDATIONS.                       I. MARKET PROMOTION.    2.  Colonial Governments and the Colonial Office give considerable assistanceto Colonial  producers in many matters affecting the production of goods, butthat assistance stops short of  establishing contact between the producer in theColonial Empire and the purchaser in the  United Kingdom or elsewhere, exceptin so  far as contacts are made through such agencies as the West  India Com-mittee,  the  Malayan Information Agency, the East African  Dependencies In-formation Office, and the more recently created office of the Trade Commissionerfor Ceylon.   The Imperial Institute,  again, does  effect  trade introductions onrequest, but its main preoccupations are the  investigation of and reporting uponEmpire economic products, their processing, and  their  display in the exhibition-tion Galleries of the Institute.(37240)A 2
    We consider that Government machinery might usefully be set up to promote the marketing of Colonial products and that measures to this end would meet requirements which are widely felt and cannot effectively be satisfied by existingagencies.  The particular measures which we have in mind are, first the creationof a service of Marketing Officers,  analogous to that formerly maintained bythe Empire Marketing  Board, secondly publicity, including publicity  by  meansof exhibition work, and thirdly certain  additional activities  which we set out below.    We consider that all these activities would best be supervised by a Board,which might, we suggest, appropriately be called the Colonial Empire MarketingBoard.    Our detailed recommendations are as  follows:            (a) Constitution of Colonial Empire Marketing Board.    3.  We consider it desirable that the Secretary of State for the colonies should be the Chairman of the Board, with the Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State eco afficio Vice-Chairman.   In order to  give continuity to the Board&apos;operations we suggest  that two  Members of Parliament from the opposition parties should be included in the Board, as  was done with  the Empire MarketingBoard.  The official members  of the Board should be the Head of  the EconomicDepartment of the Colonial Office, a  representative of the Board of  Trade orthe Department of Overseas Trade, the Director of the Imperial Institute and,if the Treasury so desire, a representative  of the Treasury. The Financial andEconomic Adviser and the Agricultural Adviser to the Secretary of State should act as assessors  to the  Board.  There should also be  a panel of  technical and scientific experts, including, it is suggested,  representatives of the Departmentof Scientific and Industrial Research, to assist the Board on the research matters referred to later in our report.   The  remaining members of  the  Board shouldbe business men of suitable experience,  and  in view of  the substantial  official and ministerial representation, we think it very desirable  that the businessrepresentatives should be sufficiently numerous to give them a full sense of respon-sibility for the operations of the Board.  We suggest that there should be fivesuch members, or six if a Treasury representative is  appointed.   They shouldbe chosen for their general business experience,  and some at any rate of them should have experience  of the marketing of  Colonial products; but  they  shouldnot be in any sense representatives of  particular  Colonies .or groups of Coloniesor of particular  Colonial industries.   It would be through the  business represen-tatives that liaison would be maintained  with bodies such as the British EmpireProducers&apos; Organization.  The proposed  constitution of the Board may be sum-marized as follows:            Secretary of State for the Colonies (Chairman);           Parliamentary  Under-Secretary   of  State   for   the  Colonies      (V ice-Chairman);           Two members of Parliament from  Opposition parties;           Five members of the business  world, including the  marketing side of      Colonial products (this  would be increased to six if the Treasury decided      in favour of being represented);           The Head of the Economic Department of the Colonial Office;           One representative of the Treasury (doubtful);           One representative of the Department of Overseas Trade  or  Board      of Trade; and           The Director of the Imperial Institute.    The Financial and Economic Adviser  and the Agricultural Adviser  to theSecretary of State should act  as regular  Assessors to the  Board, and a panel of technical and scientific  Assessors should be set up to assist on research matters.                   (&amp;;)  Functions  and Staff of the Board.    4.  The Board should possess executive and not merely advisory  functions(i.e.,  should itself  incur  expenditure through the Secretary of  State for  theColonies as its  Chairman).   It  would  be concerned  with the supervision of marketing, publicity  and certain investigations arising out of the activities ofthe marketing staff as explained below, but it  should be emphasized that it
would be desired and expected that the Board should review the whole field of marketing  of  Colonial produce and should  itself initiate further activities  ifthought desirable.  It would, of course, constitute such sub-committees as mightbe found convenient and have  the  power of co-opting members to such  sub-committees.    5.  While it is obviously essential that its activities should be closely co-ordinated with  the  activities in economic matters of the  Colonial Office (anend which should in our opinion be achieved by providing strong Colonial Officerepresentation such as we recommend) we think that, in  order to emphasizeits quasi-independent character, the Board should have its own office and secre-tariat; there is  additional reason for this in the fact that  we understand  thatthere is in  fact no available accommodation  in the Colonial Office.  The board will require at least a Secretary and Assistant Secretary with adequate typingand clerical assistance, but its full staff can obviously not be settled until experi-ence is gained of the scope of its operations.  We refer in  paragraph 11 belowto the probable expense of this headquarters organization.                      (c) Colonial Marketing Service.    6.  The main business of this  service in the United Kingdom would be tomaintain contact with distributors, manufacturers, and large users and potentialusers  of Colonial products;  and the chief concern of  the  Marketing  officers would be to extend the markets for  Colonial produce, and to this end to acquireand utilize marketing information  and market statistics and to study  the im-provement  of  methods of preparation, grading and packing.  We recommendthat there should be a Chief Marketing Officer with, at the commencement, notless than two, nor more than four,  Marketing Officers.  We have carefully  con-sidered  whether these officers should be organized  on a regional basis,  that is,should represent individual Colonial Dependencies or groups of Dependencies;or whether they should specialize in particular commodities.  While the formerorganization would have  some advantages, we think that on balance the latter would be preferable.  If  individual officers had to  act  on behalf of particular groups of Colonies, we fear that undesirable  competition and overlapping wouldresult in relation to commodities, such as oil seeds and nuts, and hides and skins,common to more than one group.  Moreover, efficient marketing requires detailed and specialized knowledge of the commodities to be dealt with, and officers acting on behalf of groups of Colonies would have to endeavour  to cover too wide  a range of commodities.  We recommend, therefore, that the Marketing officers should  specialize  on particular commodities rather  than  on the products ofparticular Colonies.    7.  We have discussed whether one of them should be permanently stationedabroad, but we came to the conclusion that at any rate at first it might be foundbest to send particular Marketing Officers abroad from  time to time as circum-stances  required.  There are certain respects in which overseas marketing workmay be expected to differ from work in the United Kingdom.  In many casesthe principal  difficulties of marketing Colonial produce overseas,  especially  inthe Continent of Europe,  arise from obstacles imposed by Governments, such asquotas,  exchange restrictions and tariffs.  Negotiations with overseas  Govern-ments on such matters are primarily the duty of  the  Commercial diplomatic service (or, in the Dominions, of the Trade  Commissioner Service).  Those Ser-vices, however, may find  it of advantage on occasion  to have the assistance,  inthe capacity  of adviser, of a  Marketing Officer  with special knowledge  of colonial trade.  Sometimes it may,  therefore, be desirable to send abroad one ofthe officers specializing in a particular group of commodities to advise in thisway.  The difficulty here,  however,  is that the commodities which are most likelyto require attention overseas are, broadly, the big staples (oil-seeds, coffee, cocoa,etc.) which may not require the same degree of attention in the home  market.Experience  may, therefore, ultimately prove that it would  be most convenient to have an  officer or officers  allotted specially to overseas work  and we do not wish that possibility to be ruled out entirely.    8.  We regard it as important that attention should be paid to the promotion of Colonial marketing in the Dominions  as well  as  in the United Kingdom,European countries and the United States of America. We make no specific recommendations on this point at  present, but it would no doubt be carefully   (37240)                                                              A 3
considered by the Marketing Board itself.  We  are  aware that certain  west indian Colonies already maintain a representative in Canada,  and it may befound convenient to alter and enlarge the functions of this officer.    9.  The existing organization  charged with the promotion of marketing of Colonial forest products in this country,  the Colonial Forest Resources Devel-opment Department, should be brought into close  association with the proposedMarketing Board and its organization of Marketing Officers.  For  the present,it should preserve its separate identity and finances, but as the work which it isdoing for Colonial  forest products is substantially the same as  that which theColonial  Empire Marketing Board is  to undertake for  Colonial productsgenerally, the possibility of combining the two organizations should be  borne in mind.    10.  An important  function of  the Marketing Officers  will be to questionusers and potential users of Colonial products as to the defects in those products which depress  their value or which militate  against  their fuller  use.   these enquiries  will undoubtedly suggest lines of investigation, some of which will result in proposals for research, while others will  lead to solutions not involvingresearch.  We recommend below that provision for research should continue tobe found  from the  Colonial Development  Fund, but we think that the ad hocinvestigations arising from the enquiries and contacts made by Marketing officers should be initiated and supervised by  the Marketing Board.   In  the conductof such investigations the fullest use should be made of existing agencies, suchas the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and the  Imperial  Insti-tute,  and close liaison should be  maintained with bodies such as the ColonialAdvisory Council on Agriculture and Animal Health engaged in connectedresearch activities.   We recommend that the necessary funds for the conduct ofthese  ad hoc investigations should be placed at the disposal  of the Board.  Theamount required may be estimated at  10,000  per annum.    11..  The salaries of the Marketing  Officers, and also of  the secretarialstaff,  will be a matter  for  subsequent  discussion between  the  Colonial  Officeand the Treasury. We are unable to forecast exactly the cost  of the organization,but we think that it would be prudent  to contemplate provision  of   20,000 perannum  in all,  to cover  all charges, including office rent, travelling expenses,stationery and other incidentals.                                (d)  Publicity.    12.   It will be recalled that the publicity activities of the Empire MarketingBoard were a very  prominent feature of its work, at any rate in the public eye.We have come to the conclusion that any similar publicity on a large scale by theproposed Colonial Empire Marketing Board is not desirable.. With some excep-tions, Colonial products are not of a kind which reach the ultimate consumer intheir  original form, and they are not  therefore generally suitable subjects foradvertisements designed to appeal to the general  public.   Nor do we think that&quot; background &apos;&quot;&apos; advertising of the  Colonial Empire could have  any effect com-parable with that of the background advertising of the Empire as a whole bythe Empire Marketing Board.  Moreover,  in the  case of a number  of products,including several which are marketed direct to the consumer, there are also otherEmpire interests involved; and  there would obviously be political difficulties,even if it were otherwise desirable, in advertising say, Ceylon tea at the expenseof Indian.   We do not recommend, therefore, that  any  extensive use shouldbe made of poster advertising, or of advertising in the ordinary  Press.  We do,however, suggest that the possibility of  advertising in trade papers should not beneglected,  and we  recommend that the Board should contemplate the engage-ment  of a Press Officer,  possibly on a part-time basis.   Such an  appointmentmight, however, be deferred until the general work of the  new organization hadbeen more fully established.   If it should eventually be  decided  to employ a press  Officer,  either part-time or  whole-time, we contemplate  that the totalexpenditure on Press work should not exceed  2,000 per annum.                               (e) Exhibitions.    13.   We attach much greater importance, from the point of view of  publi-city, to participation in exhibitions of a suitable nature.  Small  provincial exhi-bitions should be covered, as well as big London  organizations  like the BritishIndustries  Fair, and possibly  foreign exhibitions (which  we  discuss further
below).   The Board should have a permanent exhibition staff,  consisting of aHead Officer assisted by two or three assistants  (who might perhaps  be retiredColonial officials).  Representatives from the various trade agencies at presentdealing with particular Colonies or groups of Colonies might conveniently forman  Advisory  Exhibition Committee  to the  Board,  or an  Exhibition Sub-Committee.  In making this recommendation we have assumed  that the board would be able to take advantage of the facilities for  the organization of exhibition-tions already afforded by the Department &apos;of Overseas Trade.    14.   We have referred to the  possibility of participation in foreign exhibition-tions.  From the point of view of selling Colonial goods that might be desirable,as we have already pointed out the importance to the Colonial Empire of foreing markets; but there are also political considerations both in favour of and against such participation.  This is a question to be decided later, and we feel that itis outside our province to discuss the political aspects in  detail;  but we think itour duty to draw attention to the possibility of criticism in this country if UnitedK.ingdom  funds are used in  such  a way as  to promote commercial connectionsbetween Colonies and foreign countries which might ultimately be detrimental to united Kingdom trading interests.    15.   Expenses connected with  exhibitions,  including the  cost of leasingstands and the payment of salaries to staff,  are estimated very provisionally at 10,000 per annum.  This might have to be increased if  foreign exhibitions areincluded.    16.   We considered also,  in connection with these proposals, whether it was desirable to attempt to organize a Colonial exhibition on a big scale, say, nextyear.  This is obviously a wide question, raising other considerations than thoseimmediately connected with the proposed Colonial Marketing organization; butwe came to the conclusion that  we could not recommend any initiative in that direction  at present, for a number of reasons;  for  example, doubt  as  to  thevalue from a trade point of view of any such exhibition,  the difficulty of organ-izing it  in the time available before 1937, and political considerations, e.g.,  the undesirability of competing with the Paris exhibition to be held in 1937 and thegeneral  atmosphere in relation to  Colonial problems at the present time.                                 (/)  Films.    17.   We have discussed the use of films  for publicity.  Where the sale of aproduct can be influenced through the general public  (which is not the case withthe majority of Colonial products)  really good instructional  films have  un-doubted advertising value, and if  it were possible to make favourable arrange-ments with commercial companies for their production, such films might find their place in  a publicity scheme.   But  the  use of films for  propaganda is subject to  certain limitations.  The cost of distribution is high  relatively toother forms of publicity.  Unless of outstanding quality and intrinsic interest,propaganda films are not likely to be shown at the best theatres, and it is difficultto ensure that the film is exhibited at every performance in every  theatre booked.In the Colonies, films might  be  used for the purpose of instructing native pro-ducers, and films showing the whole history of a commodity,  right up  to  itsultimate consumption, may be of particular interest to such producers.    18.   If the use of films on any  considerable scale were decided  upon,  theBoard would no  doubt require a special Films  Sub-Committee, which wouldorganize the distribution of suitable films and/or arrange for their production.In the  work of  distribution  the Imperial Institute, which already does workof this kind, might well become the Board&apos;s agent.   In view of  the  tentativenature  of our conclusions on this point it is difficult to give any estimate ofthe probable cost of film work, if undertaken; but we do not think that useful work could be done on an expenditure of less than  10,000 per annum.              (g) Co-ordination with, existing Trade Agencies.    19.   The Colonial Empire Marketing Board should of course maintain close relations with the trade associations  which at present serve certain territories,e.g., East Africa,  Malaya, Ceylon, the West Indies  and  Malta.   We have sug-gested  that,  in  connection with exhibitions, representatives of those agencies
 should form a Standing Advisory Committee, and it might be found that similar co-ordinating committees would be useful in connection with other branches of the Board&apos;s activities.   The Board might also usefully consider whether it could itself  promote the establishment of regional organizations,  dealing with areas which  are not at present represented by trade agencies in this country, e.g., West Africa.                              II. RESEARCH.     20.  A  feature of permanent value in the work of the Empire Marketing Board  was the making  of grants in aid of research in the Colonies.  We have considered carefully how far the new Marketing Board could be charged with similar activities.   It appears to us that research in connection with Colonial products (from which description we exclude the ad hoc investigations referred to in paragraph 10 above) may be  classified under four broad headings:            (a) Specific production research, that is, enquiries into more  or less        self-contained problems arising in the production of commodities.           (b) Long-range fundamental production research.           (c) Consumption research into new uses.           (d) Other  aspects  of economic  research,  including research  into        transport problems.     Obviously there may be overlapping between any of these four classes, and the ad hoc  investigations  already mentioned may give rise to proposals for research of a wide range falling  under any of the above four heads.     There is at present no special  ad hoc  organization  which is specifically charged with the general supervision of research relating to Colonial questions, and we recognize that  that is,  at  any rate  in theory, a defect in  the present organization.  We  do  not, however, feel able to make  any recommendation on that point.     21.  We have  come to the conclusion  that, generally speaking, adequate attention is now devoted to class  (a), specific  production research.   In some particular commodities  (e.g., rubber and tea) extensive research schemes financed by the  industries already exist.  The general co-ordination of research activities in agricultural  products  is exercised by the  Colonial Advisory  Council on Agriculture and Animal Health, and  it is generally possible for the Council, when  it finds that  a particular  piece  of research  is  desirable, to arrange for it to be undertaken by an individual Colonial Government or group of Govern- ments, and  on a number  of occasions  it has been possible to obtain from the Colonial Development Fund assistance for such  pieces of  research as promised fairly  early  results.  It would,  however, be of value to the Colonial Empire if the Colonial Development Advisory  Committee  could  consider proposals from bodies  other than individual Colonial Governments (e.g., the Colonial Advisory Council, the Colonial Empire Marketing Board, or the Colonial Office  itself).     22.  The present difficulties in  regard to long-range fundamental production research arise from  the  facts that such research cannot hold out promise of early practical results; that  the undertaking of  it needs  some security of financial provision over a period of at  least ten years; and  that the results attained are likely  to be of interest not to one territory alone, but to  a large  number  of territories.  It is, therefore, the type of research which can best be undertaken by some central  organization, having security of financial provision for  a long period. We were informed that the  Colonial Development Advisory Committee have in the  past felt some hesitation in recommending grants for any research of this character, partly because they were unwilling to pledge their available funds over a long period, and partly because they did not feel able, as at present, constituted,  to exercise that continuing supervision,  based on  broad scientific knowledge,  which is necessary for  any lengthy  piece of research.  Until 1933, research was regarded largely as the business of the Empire Marketing Board, and this was an additional reason for the reluctance of the Colonial Development Advisory Committee to recommend assistance to research  on a  large  scale.   A further difficulty has been that, while the products on which research is needed are commonly of interest to a number of Colonies, grants from the  Colonial Development Fund  can, under the  terms of  the  Colonial  Development Act, be made  only to a  particular  Colonial  Government.   The Colonial Development
Advisory Committee have pointed out that the same difficulty may well arise inthe case of desirable schemes of development not falling under the head of research, and that if any extension of their powers is contemplated it would bedesirable to amend the Colonial Development Act so as to enable assistance forany of the purposes laid down by the Act  to be given to bodies other thanGovernments of Dependencies.  This is a matter rather beyond the sphere of out enquiry but we think it only right to draw attention to the Committee&apos;s view.    23.   We have come to the conclusion  that the Colonial Development Advi-sory Committee, with some extension of its powers, would be  the most suitablebody to control and direct long-range research work, both on  the productionand on the consumption  side; we hope that  that Committee would, in future,feel able to recommend grants for the long  periods, e.g., ten years, which arenecessary for long-range research.  We suggest:            (a)  That the Treasury should be empowered, on the recommendation      of the Colonial  Development Advisory Committee,  to grant assistance      to organizations other  than individual Colonial Governments.           (b)  That permanent arrangements  should be made for  obtaining tech-      nical advice by the  Committee by the definite association with its activities,      on the research side,  of the Colonial Advisory Council  of Agriculture      and  Animal Health,  and of such specially  formed sub-committees of      scientists and technicians, to assist it in the consideration and supervision      of research schemes, as may be found necessary.    These proposals would involve  legislation to amend the  Colonial Develop-ment Act, 1929.   They have the particular support of the Colonial DevelopmentAdvisory Committee who have stated that,  while they are fully prepared, ifempowered, to deal with research more extensively, they consider it of prime importance to have the assistance in such matters oi properly  qualified technical and scientific advisers.   It will, of course,  be  appreciated  that the scope of possible assistance from  the  Colonial  Development Fund covers research  intomatters,  e.g.,  of  health  and nutrition, other than matters  of the production,marketing  and consumption  of Colonial  products with which   we have  been particularly concerned; and in referring to the activities of the  Colonial Develop-ment Advisory Committee in research matters we have no intention of suggesting that those  activities should be  confined to the types  of research contemplate under our proposals.    24.   Further consideration will be necessary as to how the  Committee canbe strengthened  in  dealing  with  consumption  research, upon which  it is admittedly  most difficult  to obtain technical  advice.   We suggest that^ in anycase,  it is  desirable that the Committee  itself  should be consulted about theproposed changes. We have  reason to believe that the general purpose of these changes, i.e.,  to  enable  and encourage the Committee to  undertake  greaterresponsibility on the side of research, will be welcomed by the present membersof the Committee.  The  Colonial Development Fund  has not  so far ever spentup to the statutory maximum of  1,000,000 per annum, and we do  not thinkthat an increase in thatmaximum is required, at any rate at present, in orderto enable the Fund to finance  extended research activities; but it  may be thoughtthat the amendment of the Colonial Development Act affords  an opportunityfor removing that limit,  without  of course  restricting Parliamentary powersto control future grants.                          OTHER PROPOSALS.                     ORGANIZATIONS OVERSEAS.    25.  So far  we have dealt only  with   the organization which  would  berequired in this country  if our proposals  were accepted; but this organizationwould not  be  complete without corresponding  organizations in the Colonies.In order that the organization at home may be fully effective and may command the confidence of the Colonies,  means  are required by which the suggestions and wishes of the Colonies may be communicated to the Board.  There is also a need for a channel by which suggestions made by the Board for the improvementof Colonial products can be passed back to the Colonial producer.  We proposethat to  carry out these functions Colonial Governments should be invited to set
Advisory Committee have pointed&apos; out that the same difficulty may well arise inthe case  of desirable  schemes  of development not falling under the head of research,  and that if any extension of their powers is contemplated it would bedesirable  to amend the Colonial Development Act so as to enable assistance forany of the  purposes  laid down by the Act  to  be given  to bodies other thanGovernments of Dependencies.  This is a matter  rather beyond the sphere of out enquiry but we think it only right to draw attention to the Committee&apos;s view.    23.   We have come to the conclusion that the Colonial Development Advi-sory Committee, with  some extension of its powers, would be the most suitablebody to control and direct long-range research work,  both on  the productionand on the  consumption side; we hope that  that Committee would, in future,feel able to recommend grants  for the long periods, e.g.,  ten  years, which arenecessary for long-range research.  We suggest:            (a) That the Treasury should be empowered, on the recommendation       of  the Colonial Development Advisory Committee, to grant assistance       to organizations other than individual Colonial Governments.           (5) That permanent arrangements should be made for obtaining tech-       nical advice by the Committee by the definite association with its activities,       on the research side,  of the Colonial Advisory  Council  of Agriculture       and  Animal Health,  and of such specially formed sub-committees of       scientists and technicians, to assist it in the consideration and supervision       of research schemes, as may be found necessary.    These proposals would involve legislation to amend the  Colonial  Develop-ment Act, 1929.  They have the particular support of the Colonial DevelopmentAdvisory Committee who have stated that,  while they are fully prepared,  ifempowered, to deal with research more extensively, they consider it  of prime importance to have the assistance in such matters of properly qualified  technical and scientific  advisers.  It  will, of course,  be  appreciated that the  scope of possible assistance  from the Colonial  Development Fund covers research  intomatters, e.g.,  of health  and&apos; nutrition, other than matters  of the production,marketing and consumption of  Colonial products with  which  we  have  been particularly concerned; and in referring to the activities of the Colonial Develop-ment Advisory Committee in research matters we have no intention of suggesting that those activities should  be confined to the types  of research contemplate under our proposals.    24.  Further consideration will be necessary as to  how  the  Committee canbe  strengthened  in dealing with  consumption research, upon which  it  is admittedly most difficult to  obtain technical  advice.  We suggest that^ in anycase, it is desirable that the Committee itself  should be consulted about theproposed changes.   We have  reason to believe that the general purpose of these changes,  i.e.,  to enable  and encourage the Committee to  undertake greaterresponsibility on the side of research, will be welcomed by the present membersof the  Committee.  The Colonial Development Fund has  not so  far ever spentup  to the statutory maximum of  1,000,000 per annum,  and we do  not thinkthat an increase in that maximum is required, at any rate at  present, in orderto enable the Fund to finance extended research activities; but it may be thoughtthat the amendment of the  Colonial Development Act affords an opportunityfor removing that  limit, without of  course  restricting Parliamentary powersto control future grants.                         OTHER PROPOSALS.                     ORGANIZATIONS OVERSEAS.    25.   So far we have dealt  only  with the organization  which  would berequired in  this country  if our proposals were accepted;  but this organizationwould  not be  complete without  corresponding  organizations  in the   Colonies.In order that the organization at home may be fully effective and may command the confidence  of the  Colonies, means are required by which the suggestions and wishes of the Colonies may be communicated to the Board.   There is also a need for a channel by which suggestions made by the Board for the improvementof Colonial  products can be passed back to the Colonial producer. We proposethat to carry out these functions  Colonial Governments should be invited to set
up in each Dependency, or group of Dependencies, Boards including representa-tives of leading producers, shippers, and other persons engaged in the trade in colonial products.   Certain bodies  of this kind are already in existence, forexample,  the  Coffee Board  of Kenya and  the  Sisal Industry Associations in kenya and  Tanganyika and the West Indian Sea Island Cotton  Association.These organizations, however, deal with single  industries, and for the present purpose organizations  of a more comprehensive scope are desirable. We find itdifficult to predict  in  advance what exactly the functions of the  local boards would be, but we think that experience would soon show a variety  of directions in addition to those suggested above in-which they could do useful work.                      COLONIAL CONTRIBUTIONS.    26.  We have considered carefully the  extent to which the  Colonies shouldbe expected to contribute to the expenditure involved by our  proposals.  on principle, we recognize that expenditure on the marketing of Colonial  goods should be met by the  producing  Colonies rather than by the United Kingdomtaxpayer, and  that departure from this principle may give rise  to criticism.Nevertheless,  we think that it  would not  be practicable  to recover from theColonies concerned either  the cost of the Board and its staff or the cost of  publi-city&apos;undertaken in the United Kingdom.  The cost of the ad hoc investigationsreferred to in paragraph 10  should be normally regarded as recoverable from theColonies or  producers  benefited.  The Colonies  would of course be expected tobear any expenses incurred by the local Boards referred  to in paragraph 22.The question of Colonial  or trade contributions  to the cost of research  schemesassisted from the Colonial Development Fund would be a matter for considera-tion in connection with each application.                         FINANCIAL SUMMARY.    27.  The total financial provision suggestedcussed above is as follows:       1. Headquarters staff, rent, etc.   \      2. Marketing Officers  ...     ...  /      3. Ad hoc investigations      4. Exhibitions                                                        40,000Plus  (if it is  decided  to  undertake film and Press * publicity).5.  Films (minimum)    ...     ...     ...    ...    ...       10,0006.  Press work    ..................        2,000 52,000    In addition it may be assumed that a more active policy regarding research on the part of  the  Colonial Development Advisory  Committee  would lead to greater calls on the Colonial Development Fund, but it is impossible to predictwhat extra expense that may involve.    28.

                APPENDIX IV. Supplementary Report by the i Coloaial^^ark^lrii^                 Cqmiriittee. 1.     At the request of the Secretary of State, we hava given- further consideration to certain matters dealt with in our Report of the 11th of July,1936, The Secretary of State suggested that, in the functions of the Colonial Marketing  card which it is proposed to set upf greater emphasis should be laid upon research into methods of marketing, and the ixaprove- ment of those methods, as compared with market promotion and advertisement. 2.     We had, in fact, assumed that the Marketing Officers whose appointment we proposed would find it necessary, as a preliminary to any work of market promotion which they might undertake, to examine very fully the manner in which Colonial pro ducts are marketed; we agree that systematic investigation of the methods of marketing of Colonial produce from the final user right beck to the original producers would be of great value,  and that such investigations ought to he the principal function of the pz-oposedMarketing Board, at any rats in its early stages. The Board should, we think, initiate systematic surveys of the marketing of Colonial produoe, and its MarketingOfficers would he expected, as the first step of their work, not so  much to produce actual results in the way of increased Colonial trade,  as to collect, information,  which In appropriate cases would be incorporated in published reports,  on the marketing                                     c       systems
systems in operation.   It would then be for theBoard to consider how far improvements in suchmarketing system were desirable and possible and tomake whatever recommendations it might think necessaryto that end.   Thus the most important- work of theBoard would be  directed &apos;towarue this form of marketing investigation,&apos; since the improvement of marketing methods is probably in the long run themost potent means of strengthening the position of producers and of improving generally the economic position of the Colonial i&amp;npire.  But we remain of theopinion that, even where methods of marketing are satisfactory or can be mads satisfactory, geographicalsocial and other conditions often render it impossiblefox- Colonial producers to take full advantage of thefacilities offered, and we contemplate that directmarket promotion of the type indicated in cur report would form part of the functions of the Board and its officers at any rate at a later stage.  In thisconnection we would emphasise the importance of organising displays at exhibitions,, etc.3.     This modification of the Board&apos;s functions would not involve alterations of its main structure.or of the proposal to exiiploy a number of MarketingOfficers in this country, although it would mean that the officers selected must include persons with                     for,.;special -qual if ioatlonsA carrying out marketingsurveys and research.&apos;  It zss however, necessary toany such systematic survey of marketing organisation that investigations should not be confined to thiscountry.  There would be much to be done in the
 Colonies themselves,  and for  that  purpose we recommend that  the Board  should be empowered;, &quot;both to send out its own officers.,  or  specially appointed investigators, to conduct  special enquiries  in the Colonies,  and. also to assist Colonial Governments financially  in  the conduct of  special market investigations.   In  certain cases  investigations  would, no  doubt have to cover foreign countries.     4,   The quesiion arises  of making f financial provision for the  overseas surveys and investigat ions contemplated in the preceding  paragraph,.  Such operations, it should  be made  clear, would be  addi tionai&quot; to the  normal activities  of the Board!s regular officers, and consequently would not be covered by the sum of   20,000 at  which  the cost of those normal activities has been estimated,   How far wor3r of thiskind ought to be financed from this country or how far it should be met from  Colonial  funds will be matters forconsideration by the Board as  individual cases arise, soalso the question  of securing  local co-operat:lont.evg.  through local Marketing BoardSj which it  has beensuggested should be established.  But in order that theBoard may have funds at its disposal to meet the cost ofthese additional oversea  activities, we consider that provision will have to be made for the expenditure of notless  than  10,000..
     5.   It will be retnenibered that in our Report weestimated that the total financial requirements of theBoard, when its  activities were fully developed, would be ofthe order of about  50,000 a&quot;year.  It is not easy to say whether the total of this estimate requires.modification&quot;as a result, of the proposal that in the first, few years theBoard5s principal function should be the systematicinvestigation of marketing methods.  On the one hand,, suchinvestigation may involve somewhat higher expenditure on staffthan we had previously contemplated.  On the other hand, theestimates given  in our first Report contained provision forcertain activities which may&apos;not develop fully until afterthe expenses of  investigation into marketing methods have passed their peak.  In all the circumstances we think that thefigure given in  our first Report might stand as a general indication of the order of magnitude of the annual expenditure likely to be involved by our proposals,     6.   The above has been agreed by the majority of themembers of the Committee but the Treasury representative hasbeen unable to agree to paragraphs 3 and 4 in their present form and has suggested amendments which.are set out in an appendix.
                   Appendix.,Amendments to paragraphs &apos;3 and 4 suggested by the Treasury                 r epr e sentat ive.1.        Omit from paragraph 5 &quot;and also to assistColonial Governments ............ special market investigations11.B.        Amend paragraphs.4.and 5 to read as follows       4.  The question will arise of. the incidence,  as    between the Board ana the Colonies concerned, of  the cost  -  ox marketing investigations in the Colonies.   In    paragraph 26 of our Report we recommended that; the cost    of,&apos; the ad hoc investigations  referred to in paragraph 10    of that Report should be normally regarded as    recoverable from the Colonies or producers bene-fl-osd.    Similarly, we think that the  expenses involved in    marketing investigations in the Colonies should be    regarded as normally chargeable to the Colonies in    which, ana for whose benefit,  the investigations  are being    made.  In special cases  the Board might refrain from    recovering the salaries  and expenses  of Marketing -    Officers or other investigators sent  by them to a    Colony,  but in so far as the  investigation is carried    out by staff appointed by the  Colony  or by the local    Marketing Board,  the cost  should be a final charge on the    funds of the Colony.   We assume that  in the case  of grant    or loan aided Colonies,  due allowance would be made for    these expenses in fixing the grant or loan in aid.
