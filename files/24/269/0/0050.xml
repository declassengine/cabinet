Air Ministry, May 26, 1937.[I.A.C. 330-A.]   INTER-DEPARTMENTAL  COMMITTEE  ON INTERNATIONAL                       AIR COMMUNICATIONS.   GERMAN PENETRATION IN CIVIL AVIATION IN THE NEAR AND FAR EAST.            Memorandum by the Air Ministry and Foreign Office.                                    1.    EVER since  the advent of the Nazi Regime in Germany, there has beenevidence of increased  German activity abroad in the many fields  which offerfavourable opportunities for the expansion of German influence and commerce,and during the last two years these activities have been intensified in the field ofcivil aviation no less than in  other fields.    If these activities in South-East Europe  and in the Near and. Far East  areviewed not  in  isolation as mere  attempts  at local  penetration,  but  as  theco-ordinated development of a single policy, then their definite  purpose becomesreadily apparent,  and that is the vigorous revival of the &quot; Drang Nach Osten &quot;in the air.    The  progress which Germany is  making  in Greece, Egypt, Iraq,  Persia,Afghanistan and  China is briefly  indicated below.  The German efforts  in eachof these countries should be regarded as part of one whole plan.                              II.-GREECE.    In pursuance of her policy of expansion Germany  managed  to obtain a concession from Greece  for Deutsche Luft Hansa to extend their service fromSofia to Salonica  in 1932.  Co-operation  was next established with the Greekcompany which had obtained the concession (Icaros) for the development of  airlines in Greece, and this afforded the German company the opportunity to improve       [15287]                                                     B
 their foothold, which the international situation has subsequently enabled them to consolidate.  Last November,  taking advantage of the  changes m the Greek Government, the Germans were  able to negotiate favourable  Governmental and inter-company agreements under which the Deutsche Luft Hansa,  in addition to their service to Salonica, have secured rights to operate to Athens and Rhodes from the direction of Sofia and also from that of Venice.     In virtue of the inter-company agreement  the Deutsche Luft Hansa and the Greek Air Line  now represent each other reciprocally in  Germany  and Greece. Moreover, the  German  Company undertakes to put its chief technical expert at Deceleia  at the disposal of the Greek Air Line  free of charge.  The service to Athens was inaugurated in January of this year and the agreements referred to above have secured for  Germany the necessary  transit rights for services further afield.     But  this  is  not the whole  extent of  German penetration.   A school for training  Greek civil pilots for the  Greek air  lines has been  established by the Germans at Salonica and Greek pilots also receive training on the  German air lines operating between Germany and Greece.   German aircraft are being sold to Greece at attractive prices.     German money and propaganda, and above all Germany&apos;s State-controlled economic policy have established a strangle-hold over Greece, which is likely to close down still further on British interests in the field of civil aviation.  There can be little doubt that the attractions offered by  Germany  are partly responsible for  the difficulties which  impede our present  negotiations for a new Air Con- vention with Greece.  The harm which this German penetration can do to British interests  may well pass beyond the  commercial sphere  and assume a strategical aspect, Germany obtaining aerodrome and repair facilities in Greek territory which might some day enable her to threaten our  Mediterranean communications.                                III. EGYPT.   .  As Turkey has firmly closed her doors, Egypt is the next  goal for a German route to the East.     German influence was brought to bear upon Taher Pasha, Vice-Chairman of Misr air work, the Anglo-Egyptian concessionaire company  subsidised  by the Egyptian Government.  In 1936 proposals were  made  for the formation, under Taher Pasha&apos;s chairmanship, of a German-Egyptian company styled &quot;Fforus,&quot; to be financed and subsidised by Germany, for a service between Athens and Egypt in the first instance.  The fact that the Vice-Chairman of the  Egyptian National Company should be associated with this enterprise is an indication of the extent bf German intrigue.     As the result of the vigorous opposition which we were able to prompt in. Ministerial quarters in Egypt, combined with the Egyptian Governments lack of enthusiasm for the project, the application for Floras to establish this service was rejected.   Defeated in this line of approach, the Germans in December last formally  applied for temporary  permission to operate a service between Berlin and Cairo, via Athens and Rhodes &quot; which  would facilitate intellectual and commercial relations between Germany  and  Egypt,&quot; and  &quot;would eventually extend beyond the Egyptian Frontiers.&apos;&apos;  Permission to make experimental flights before the end of 1936 was requested.     Various pretexts have been advanced for holding off this  application, but it seems, likely that the Egyptian Government will feel bound  in the long run to accord facilities, at.least for transit services, especially  as  the Germans  have offered to forego passenger traffic in  Egypt.     In the meantime,  the recent &apos;1 Oasis &apos;&apos; race has afforded the  Germans an opportunity of impressing local opinion, and with this in view a large passenger: aircraft flown by two picked German military  pilots was sent, with  a number of other modern  aircraft, to participate.  The aircraft,  having  completed its task in Egypt, has  proceeded to Iraq  and will, from there, continue its demonstration in.Iran and Afghanistan.     The  influence of Taher Pasha is being directed to displacing British interests in Misr air work by German.  If he is.successful, the consequences will be far- reaching, ,ahd; in order, to avert  this eventuality  discussions are now proceeding with Imperial Airways .(Limited)j with a view to  their participation  in the share- holding in Misr Airwbrk in the event of air work (Limited) being unable to take up therbalance of their allotted capital holding.
                                IV. IRAQ.    Information concerning future German air projects.in Iraq is at presentsomewhat vague.   The country is already served by  three well-established airlines Imperial Airways, Air  France (Air Orient) and K.L.M.-in addition toa Bagdad-Cairo  shuttle service, run  by  Misr air work, a combined British-Egyptian organisation, and a shuttle service run by Air France between Damascusand Bagdad.  Any German venture would, therefore, from its inception  haveto contend  with  healthy competition.  Feeder  services within  Iraq will,  iffinancial considerations allow, in all  probability be  operated by  the  Iraqisthemselves, particularly  as the Iraqi Government are very anxious to establish a &quot; national &quot; air service, and  the reorganisation of the Royal Iraqi Air Force isunderstood to include the building up of a &quot; civilian reserve &quot; of pilots.    It is known that Germany, through the Luft Hansa Company, has schemes,however nebulous they may be at present,  for the extension of civil  air routesoperating  via  Bagdad through Persia  to the Far East, and Iraqi  reactions tosuch tentative proposals as have been advanced through the medium of the GermanConsul in Bagdad have not been entirely unfavourable.  The risk exists that, ifIraq cannot obtain from His Majesty&apos;s Government a satisfactory offer of modernmilitary aircraft for the expansion of her air force, she may turn to the Germans,who are very anxious to step in.  If this risk materialises, the Germans would bein a favourable position to ask  for preferential treatment for their civil aviation,or to enter the local market for civil aicraft, e.g., as the essential foreign element in any &apos;&apos; national&apos;&apos; Iraqi Company.  It is understood from a recent despatch from His  Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Bagdad  that the Iraqi Government  havedecided  in  principle that there is no objection to the organisation by the  LuftHansa of an Air Service across Iraq to Kabul.                                 V. IRAN.    In February 1927,  the  Junkers Persian  Air Transportation Company,  aGerman  enterprise  controlling most  of  the commercial  aviation in  Iran,commenced working  internal services from Teheran to Baku, Bushire, Bagdadand Meshed.  But the venture closed down in  March 1932, mainly owing to thefinancial  collapse of  the parent Junkers company in Germany.  Actually, theLuft Hansa took over the Junkers  organisation, and  may have made odd flights,but all regular services ceased from the date the Junkers Company liquidated itscontract with the Iranian Government.    During the recent visit to Teheran of Dr. Schacht, however, the re-inaugura-tion of civil air routes in Iran under German operation is understood to  havebeen discussed.   The tentative proposals provided for     (a) A through line  from Berlin to Kabul via  Bagdad and Teheran,  with          Kermanshah  and Hamadan as emergency landing grounds, and two          other emergency landing grounds between Teheran and Meshed.    (b) Subsidiary feeder lines within Iran to be operated by Junker aircraft.    (c) All ground organisation to be in the hands of German operatives.    The  latest  information  available suggests that,  whilst the Iranians might agree to (a) and to the presence of a limited number of German mechanics at the aerodromes, (b) and (c) would be refused.    These negotiations may be affected by the agreement for the establishment ofa service  between Teheran and Bagdad  which is understood to have been reachedrecently by the Iranian Government with the Iraqi Government.                            VI. AFGHANISTAN.    German penetration in civil aviation in Afghanistan has not as yet achievedany tangible results,  but  there is considerable evidence to show that the german authorities are taking seriously their plan to run an air service to Kabul and, ifpossible,  beyond there to Sinkiang, China  and possibly Japan.  (The japanese have also shown interest in the scheme.)  The  route  beyond Afghanistan wouldnot appear to offer many commercial advantages and for some time to come the operational difficulties would appear to be very considerable.  Moreover, Sovietinfluence, which is very strong in Sinkiang, is likely to be an obstacle.  But in the      [15287]                                                    B 2
 course of a visit to Kabul in July 1936 a German Junker 6-seater aeroplane made a reconnaissance up to the Chinese frontier.  An attempt was made to cross the Pamir, but the aircraft was unable to gain sufficient height.  Soon after this two Germans established a  meteorological station on the top  of a pass in northern Afghanistan at which observations were taken throughout the winter.     It is evident, however, that the Germans would like to start a service to Kabul even if they Could  not go beyond.  The Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs told His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabul on February 3rd that the German Charge d&apos;Affaires had informed him that the German Government had decided to establish  a through  service from Berlin to the Far  East  and  asked the permission of the Afghan Government to fly across their territory.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs had replied that the Afghan Government would consider this request when they knew that the German Government had agreed with the Iraqi and Persian  Governments  for  passage  across  their territories.  The Afghan Prime  Minister subsequently  asked His  Majesty&apos;s  Minister  whether His Majesty&apos;s  Government  could  not influence the  Iraqi  Government  to refuse permission for the German service to cross Iraq.  His Majesty&apos;s Minister did not encourage this idea.  (The Iraqi Government have now granted permission for the  Service.)   The  German representatives at Cairo informed the Egyptian Government on the 27th March that the eastern terminus of their  proposed line for which they wanted facilities in Egypt was &quot; Kabul to begin with.&quot;     The German machine mentioned in paragraph 5 of Section III (Egypt) has also flown to Kabul, but it is not known whether the officers in charge of it carried the negotiations any further.     A German ex-officer pilot is at present in Kabul engaged on renovating two Old Afghan Junker aeroplanes.  It was thought that he was intended to create the nucleus of an Afghan civil aviation service, but the Afghan  Prime Minister has  told Colonel Fraser-Tytler that this is not  strictly true,  though it was proposed to employ such aircraft as the Afghan Government possess on  civil duties.     The Commander of the Afghan Air Force is about to leave this country for Berlin.                               VII.-CHINA.     Working  from the other end of the chain,  Germany has secured a foothold in China, but her attempts  to push westwards have hitherto been unsuccessful.     In 1931 the Sino-German Company &quot; Eurasia &quot; was formed for the develop- ment of internal air services in China, and for the opening up of a route through Manchuria and Siberia to Europe.  Russia was obdurate, however, and  this latter part of the scheme proved abortive.     The Germans, therefore, instituted informal  enquiries with regard to thepossibility of Eurasia extending their Shanghai-YUnnanfu service to Rangoon or Calcutta.  We agreed with the Government of India that this  extension couldnot be permitted, and that  if an air connection -with Europe was desired by the Sino-German Company,  it should be made at Hong Kong by means of imperial airways Limited?s  service.  It seems likely that an application by Eurasia to fly to Hong Kong will,  in fact,  shortly be  received.    In February last, however,  the Manager of the Company made it clear toour Air Attache in Shanghai  that the main  objective of German civil aviationpolicy in the East  is still  a direct service between  Berlin and  Shanghai, andit is evident that they are bending all their efforts in that direction.                                   VIII.    From the commercial standpoint this penetration by Germany in the near and  Far East  can  only be viewed  with  disquiet.    In the attainment of her objective, money seems to be no obstacle; pioneeringflights are undertaken and services started without regard to expense.  The localorganisations which  are created at the places of call of German air lines serve as focal points for the spread of German influence which is also  fostered by the undoubted high standard of the services invariably provided, and by the efficiency of the material and personnel  employed.
    The route in prospect traverses fertile fields for the growth of this influence.If Germany gains control of civil aviation in the minor States along this route,her methods will make it hard to displace her.    Trade also follows the flag.    The fact that British influence runs counter to her purpose goes some wayto explain the present deterioration  of our relations  with Germany in civilaviation in Europe and her desire to extort concessions for every facility accorded to us.    It accounts  for Germany recent  desire  to  extend  the Anglo-German air navigation Convention to include British overseas territories, a request to which no official answer was returned, although it was unofficially intimated that it did not meet with our approval.  It also accounts  for her representations thatthe absence of colonies cramps her developments in civil aviation.    The strategic aspect is not here directly in question,  but the prospect of aGerman air line being firmly established as  a conductor  rail supplying motiveforce for centres of German  &apos;&apos; Kultur &apos;&apos; along one of  the main lines of our Empirecommunications cannot be  regarded with less misgiving  from that standpointthan from the commercial angle.April 22,  1937.
