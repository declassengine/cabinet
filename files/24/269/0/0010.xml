Appreciation of the Political Situation, bythe Government of India, dated 19th March, 1937*      Circulated for the information of the Cabinetby the Secretary of State for India.
77Confidential appreciation of the Political Situation in India, dated the 19th March 1937,  issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.1.     The elections are now complete in all the Provinces.The arrangements for  the polling worked smoothly everywhere,hut placed a severe tax on the district staff.   Althoughminor  incidents occurred, the polling was, on the whole,conducted with remarkable orderliness.2.     It is now possible to survey the results as  awhole.   In the Punjab and Sind the Congress members of thenew Assemblies form a small minority, while in Bengal, Assamand the North-West Frontier Province their numbers, thoughlarger, vrould be effective only in conjunction with other parties.   In the remaining 6 Provinces the Congress hasobtained a clear majority over all other parties, but in bombay, so far as party grouping has yet gone, the  majorityis only 5 in the Lower and 2 in the Upper House.    In theUnited Provinces, although they have a clear majority of hOin the Assembly, the  Congress could command a majority of011137- h in both Houses together.   In Bihar .their niajorityis 38  in the Assembly or 28 in both Houses;   in the central provinces and Orissa, where there are no Upper Houses,they have majorities  of 28 and 12, respectively, over allother  parties;  and in Madras the Congress have surprisedthemselves and their  opponents by obtaining clear majoritiesof 103 and 6 in the Assembly and the Council.3.     On the whole,  Congress has done better than  was generally expected, although their comparative failure in bengal was remarkable;   while in Bombay, one of thestrongholds of the party, a more sweeping victory wouldhave surprised no one.   In Madras the failure of the
78                                                      2.Justice Party which has long been in power, was due partly to natural reaction and partly to the greatlysuperior organisation of the Congress and the much larger number of canvassers they employed.   The latter cause was indeed apparent generally, and it must be admitted that other parties have much to learn about the conduct of an election with the franchise extended as now.   TheCongress, however, in accordance with their avowedprogramme of using the elections to foment unrest amongstthe masses, lost no opportunity of appealing to thepredatory instincts of peasants and workers, and ofexploiting local grievances and prejudices, especiallyagainst the landlord class.       These methods were conspicuously successful inthe United Provinces and Bihar.   Elsewhere the ignorance of the voters was often exploited and they were persuaded to regard the Congress ballot box as an avenue of approach to Mr. Gandhi.   Everywhere many wild promiseswere made that the success of Congress candidates would lead to a reduction or remission of rent, taxes, land revenue and other debts, and the effects of thesedangerous expectations are already discernible in someprovinces in a reluctance to pay rent and Government dues.In the United Provinces there is some apprehension that relations between landlords and tenants will sufferpermanently as a result of these activities.   While,hov/ever, the elections have undoubtedly has an unsettlingeffect in rural areas, excitement is now subsiding and lifeis resuming its normal course.       The formation of parties in the new Legislaturesis still in a fluid state, and in provinces where Congress
                                                        7 C                                                    3.is in a position to accept office, not much progress can&quot;be expected until the attitude of that party towardsoffice acceptance is definitely settled.       In Bengal and the Punjah, however, party formationhas been progressing on healthy lines and in the formerprovince, two important Muslim groups have formed a coalition which seems likely to attract the third suchgroup and to result in the formation of a Ministryindependent of Congress.   Among Congress the questionof office acceptance has been anxiously canvassed andthe position created by the elections has resulted in avery strong inclination in its favour, notwithstanding the strong opposition of the Congress President, JawaharlalNehru, and the Congress Socialist Party.   Prom a statement issued by the Congress Working Committee after a meetingat Wardha at the end of February, it appears that they areprepared to maintain, a rigid central control over the workof their members in the Legislatures and the policy oftheir Ministers if they take office.       At the same time, their success in the electionshas thrown upon them the responsibility of redeeming theirpledges to the electors rather than working only., for the breakdown of the constitution, which is announced as their main object in entering the Legislatures.   Faced with a difficult decision, they are now mainly concerned to finda solution which would enable them to embark onconstructive work without alienating their left wingsupporters and they hope to achieve this by attachingconditions to their acceptance of office which will makeit appear that they are working the constitution only ontheir own terms.
80     &quot;When, therefore, they met at Delhi for the &quot;nationalconvention&quot; in the&apos; middle of March the Congress WorkingSommittee found themselves faced with a difficult task inthe discovery of a formula, which would enable them to meetthe Right Wing demand for either conditional or unconditionaloffice acceptance without too obviously receding from their declared attitude towards the constitution or antagonisingthe Left Wing, including their President.     After four days&apos; debate, which revealed sharp differences of opinion, a resolution was adopted by which acceptance of office is authorised in provinces where Congress command amajority in the Legislature provided the leader of the party is satisfied and is able to state publicly that the Governorwill not use his special powers of interference or set aside the advice of his Ministers in regard to their constitutionalactivities.  This resolution is evidently concerned to create the fiction that Congress has accepted office only on itsown terms and shows some misunderstcnding of the Governor&apos;constitutional position.  However, in so far as it is apparently adapted to leave the way open for officeacceptance to those who are prepared&apos;td interpret it with sufficient latitude, it must be regarded as, to that extent,a definite victory for the moment for the Right Wing.  At anyrate, Nehru and his followers, who had.hoped for an immediatedeadlock, made no secret of their dissatisfaction with theresult.     Their views were allowed to influence.the resolution to the extent of including in it a reiteration &quot;of the determination to end the Constitution and fresh emphasis  onthe importance of work outside the Legislatures.  But the
final result cannot disguise the fundamental antagonismbetween the views of the two main, groups composing  congress and the semblance of unity preserved on this occasion wasthinner than usual.  A day or two after the resolution hadbeen passed by the All-India Congress Committee,  the WorkinCommittee announced the setting up of machinery  for thecentral control of the Congress parties in the provincial legislatures.  The position is still uncertain and  the effeof the resolution can only be tested in the light of theresults of this control.
