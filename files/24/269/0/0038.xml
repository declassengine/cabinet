Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1937.SECRET.                                                         Copy  No.  ^CP. 133 (37).CABINET.SOUTH-WEST AFRICA.        Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.    I THINK that my colleagues may like an opportunity of reading the texts of the recent documents  regarding  South-West Africa.  I  attach them as appendices to this  note, which  briefly  recapitulates  the main  points  of the controversy between the Union of South Africa and Germany.    I circulated  in  February a memorandum (CP.  74) on  the subject of  adeclaration by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union of South Africa of theirattitude as regards  the future administration of South-West Africa.  In that declaration it was stated, inter alia, that the Union  Government had decided torender it impossible for aliens to become or to be  members of political organisa-tions, or of any public bodies and other organisations of which the administrationof South-West  Africa might consider  it  undesirable  that  aliens  should be members.    The Union Government have subsequently taken action, which has receiveda great deal of publicity, to implement their declaration on this point.   On the27th March a proclamation was  made,  a copy of which is attached as Annex I,which provides  that no person who is not a British subject shall, without the written permission of the competent authority, become  a member or employee ofa &quot; public body &quot;  or a political organisation, and that any British subject withinthe territory who  takes an oath,  or promises to be faithful to or bear allegiance to, or obey the orders of     (a) any sovereign or head of state other than H.M. the King, or    (b) the Government of any state other than the Union, or    (c) any foreign political organisation shall be guilty of an offence.    The Administrator or whoever has been designated for the purpose may bynotice declare any body of persons  to which has  been  entrusted by law the performance of any public function to be a  &quot; public body,&apos;&apos; and may likewisedeclare, any association of persons to be a  political organisation or a foreignpolitical organisation for the purpose of the proclamation.    The provisions of the proclamation are drastic and place very considerablepower in  the hands of the  Administrator, but in the opinion of the  UnitedKingdom High Commissioner in  the Union of South Africa they probably go hofurther than is required to deal  adequately with the position.  They are clearlydesigned to exclude all but British subjects from any share in the administration,and they make it impossible for any foreign political organisation to exist in theterritory, since no one who is not a British  subject may belong to any political organisation and no British subject may promise to obey the orders of any foreignpolitical organisation.    The German Government at once protested against the terms of the proclama-tion  on the ground that it put the German population in the territory under  aspecial  law  within  the  general  administrative   regulations,  that  it was      [15156]            &quot;                          ^               B
contradictory to the provisions of the Mandate, and that it would only aggravate the existing difficulties.  The note concluded as follows :  &quot; The German Govern-ment therefore consider it to be their duty to raise their warning voice and mustleave it now to the Union Government to take the necessary steps so that no serious damage will be done by carrying out the proclamation.&quot;   A copy of this note isattached as Annex II.     On the 15th April  the Union Government replied by a note, in which they stated that they had been guided in their action by the imperative need to ensurethe proper administration of the territory for which they were responsible andthat, although the immediate cause for&quot; the promulgation of the proclamation wasthe  activity of  certain German nationals who were  not British  subjects,  the proclamation did not in terms discriminate against German nationals.  The noteconcluded that the Union Government trusted that the German nationals in  theterritory would give no occasion for the  application of the provisions of  the proclamation to them, and  stated that the Union Government  would welcome the co-operation of the German Government in that regard. The text of this note(with the exception of the  opening paragraph,  which is not yet available) isattached as Annex  III.     The Union Government have followed up this note by action which showsthat they have no intention of withdrawing  from the position which  they havetaken up.  On the 19th April the. South-West Africa administration declared thethree political  parties in South-West Africa, namely, the United South-WestAfrica Party, the Economic League and the Deutsche  Bund (the German party)to be political organisations under the terms of the proclamation.  The effect ofthis action  is to confine membership  of these organisations  to  British subjects and to forbid any person who is not a  British subject from  acting as an officerof the organisations, addressing any of their meetings, contributing to theirfunds or taking any part in their activities.  The penalties for any breach of the proclamation are a fine not exceeding  100,  imprisonment for not more than ayear, or both, while  the Administrator is given power to remove as an undesirableany person not a British subject who is  engaged actively in political propaganda in the  territory, or any person who has been convicted under the Proclamation.

(No. Kap 295.)(Translation.)Sir,                                              Capetown, April 5, 1937.    WITH reference  to  the South-West  Africa Affairs Proclamation, 1937rpublished in the Government Gazette on the 2nd April, 1937, I have the honour,under  instructions from  my  Government,  to  convey  to  you  the  followingcommunication :     &quot; The German Government feel compelled to protest against this  Proclama-tion because  it puts the German population in  the Mandated Territory under special  law  within  the  general  administrative  regulations.   The  GermanGovernment have  expressed  their objections against this measure already in previous notes; they therefore confine themselves here to the following remarks :-    The Proclamation must  be considered  as a  combative measure against theGermans in South-West Africa.  This does not only result from the declarationof the  Union  Government as published on  the 11th December, 1936, by whichthese  measures  have  been  announced,  but  also from the  connection  of  the proclamation  with the report  of  the South-West Africa Commission,  on  theunproved allegations of which the Proclamation is based.    For such a combative measure of the South African Government against theGermans in South-West Africa there is no justified reason  whatsoever.  the allegation of an  inadmissible interference of German nationals with institutions of the Territory brought forward as justification is not correct, neither  in generalnor for the last two years.    The Germans in  South-West Africa  can justly feel cause for  grievancebecause, in spite of the London Agreement  of 1923 and of subsequent promises,equal rights in politics, culture, language, and partly also in economics, are moreand more being  denied to them, and because they are being hampered in their development by measures of the most various kinds.    This deplorable situation is contradictory to the provisions of the Mandate,which impose on the Mandatory Government, as trustee, the duty to promote the welfare of all the inhabitants of the Mandated Territory.  The situation is noweven more aggravated by the Proclamation, which is opening illimited scope forthe arbitary decision of an administrative authority.    The German  Government  repeatedly  have  asked the Government  of  theUnion of South Africa to eliminate South-West African tensions through mutual understanding.  The present unjustified measures of the Union Government will,in all probability, intensify the impression with the German section of South-WestAfrica that the Union  Government do not care for a reconciliation of the various sections of the population, and will necessarily bring about a further aggravationof the differences between these sections.    The German Government, therefore, consider it to be their duty to  raise theirwarning voice, and must  leave it now to  the Union  Government to take  thenecessary  steps  so that no  serious damage will be done by carrying  out  the proclamation.&quot;    Please accept, Mr. Prime  Minister, the renewed assurance of my highestconsideration.                                    (Signed)      E.  WIEHL,   .,                                                        German Minister.    The Prime Minister of the        Union of  South Africa, Capetown.
    Text of Note from the Union Government to the German Government,                              April 15, 1937.    &quot; THE Union  Government  have  considered  the  representations of  theGerman Government with the greatest care and I may  at the outset assure theGerman Government that in their action the Union Government were not inspired by any unfriendly motive towards  the  German Reich.   They have throughoutcontinued to be guided by the imperative need to ensure the proper administrationof the territory for which they are responsible and by a profound desire to promoteits ordered development and peaceful progress.    The  Union  Government sincerely regret,  therefore,  that  the  GermanGovernment felt themselves compelled to urge that the Proclamation must beconsidered  as a combative measure against Germans in the territory.    In so far  as the German Government may consider the Proclamation to becombative,  it may be stated that it is directed against practices which the UnionGovernment, on evidence  given before the South-West Africa Commission and on other information, regard as established and inasmuch as the Union government consider these practices to preclude conciliation between the various sections ofthe population and to be against the interests of Germans, as well as of otherinhabitants of the  territory, they conceive this Proclamation to have been issuednot in breach of the trust imposed by the Mandate, but in pursuance of their duty to carry Out that trust.    It is recognised that  the activities in the mandated territory of some Germannationals who  are not British subjects, were the immediate cause for the promulgated-gation of the Proclamation.  The Union Government feel, however, that it shouldbe borne in mind that the Proclamation applies equally in respect of all personswho are not British subjects, and does not in terms discriminate against Germannationals.    The  Union Government  are  convinced that in the administration  of the mandated territory they have always, to the fullest possible extent which circum-stances have allowed, given effect to the provisions of the London Agreement, 1923.In recent years, however, the  execution of the  policy set forth in the first article of the Agreement has been rendered difficult by the fostering in the territory of aconception  which prevents many Germans in the territory from throwing in theirlot with South Africa  and conducting their lives in accordance with the spirit and the meaning of that Agreement.    The reconciliation of the various sections of the European inhabitants of theterritory is a matter which has the undivided attention of the Union  Government,and they will  in  a spirit of  friendliness towards  the German community  as awhole continue to do whatever may be in their  power in order to bring about the desired relations.    The Union Government trusts that the German nationals will give no occasion for the application of  the provisions of the Proclamation to them and would welcome the co-operation of the German Government in that regard.&quot;
