83THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANWIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERMIEM?,SECRET                                              QOFY NO.^^O.P,107(57J*                          CABINET                   METHYLATED SPIRITS (SCOTLAND)  BILL.           Memorandum by the Secretary pf State for Scotland.     1. The Scottish Standing Committee is meeting on the 13th April toconsider the Methylated Spirits (Scotland) Bill which was introduced under  theten minute rule by Miss Horsbrugh and to which the House of Commons  gave  anunopposed Second Reading.     2. The Bill proposed that methylated spirits should be sold by retail  only by persons and in premises registered in lists to be kept by local authorities.It proposes further to require the retailer to keep a register of each saleshowing the quantities sold, the date of sale, the name and address  of the purchaser and the purpose for which the spirits are to be used.    Since theSecond Reading one of the backers, Mr. Westwood,  has put on the  Order Paperamendments designed to bring surgical as well as methylated spirits  withinthe scope of the Bill.     3, A similar Bill, applicable throughout the United Kingdom, was introduced by Miss Horsbrugh three years ago but failed to secure a  sufficientmajority under Standing Order No. 27 to enable it to obtain a Second Reading.The application of the present Bill is limited to Scotland,     4. The drinlcing of methylated spirits in Scotland, either, alone  or inconjunction with cheap red wine, lias been for many years a subject of complaint.The extent of the evil is difficult to ascertain but I have no reason to doubt that it constitutes a fairly serious social problem in Scotland,particularly in the larger towns.   Attempts to render the spirits sonauseating as to be undrinkable by requiring the addition of suitabledenaturants before retail sale have failed to eradicate the practice completely.     5. In these circumstances I do not propose that any obstacle should,  beput in the way of the Bill becoming law.   Objection to its proposals may be                                                                expressed/
expressed on behalf of chemists and drysalters but there is a substantial body of opinion in favour of legislative action, and I feel that whilethe proposals may require amendment in certain respects they go some way towards remedying an admitted evil,      6.  I propose, therefore, that during the Committee proceedings and thefurther stages of the Bill the Government spokesman should jnaintain anon-committal but not unfriendly attitude; and that I should beauthorised, without in any way committing the Government to support ofthe Bill, to co-operate with the promoters in framing any amendmentsnecessary to ensure that if it reaches the Statute Book it does so in a workable form.                                       W.E.E.2nd April, 1937.
