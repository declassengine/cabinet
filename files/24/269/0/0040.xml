Copy No.   47CP. 135 (37).CABINET.COMMITTEE  ON THE ASSYRIANS  IN  IRAQ.                                REPORT.Introduction.    AT their Meeting on the 20th January,  1937 (Cabinet 2 (37),  Conclusion 2),the Cabinet referred the  question  of  the Assyrians in Iraq to a  committee composed as follows :         The Home Secretary (in the Chair).        The Secretary of State for  Foreign  Affairs.        The Lord Privy Seal.        The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.        The Secretary of State for the Colonies.        The Secretary of State for  War.        The First Lord of the Admiralty.    The   Parliamentary  Under-Secretary   for   Foreign  Affairs   (ViscountCranborne) represented the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at the meetingsof the Committee.    2.  The matter on which we are  asked to advise  is the practicability of settling the Assyrians, as  a homogeneous Christian community, elsewhere thanin Iraq,  where they and  their Mohammedan  neighbours find it hard to livepeaceably side by side.    The  difficulty in the Assyrians remaining in Iraq is their desire not merely for religious, but if possible for  national, or at  all events  for administrative,autonomy, and, on the other hand,  the conviction of the Iraqis that  their existenceas a nation depends upon the welding together of the various racial and religiousentities of which their country is composed.    The question has been before  the League Council for a number of years andno solution is yet in sight.  A Committee of the Council has been formally  chargedwith  the  problem since December  1932.  It has  proved  impossible, for good reasons, to proceed with the various schemes which the Council Committee hasexamined.  It  is feared that, if no solution is discovered before its next meeting,the Council Committee will throw in its hand.    3.  The original home of  the  Assyrians  was the mountainous Hakkiaricountry, which lies on the borders of Turkey and Iraq, but has formed part of theformer country since the  frontier was fixed by the Council of the League ofNations in 1925.    The Assyrian community is estimated to number about 30,000 in all.  Thenumber still in Iraq is some 20,000.   Of this 20,000, perhaps half  are anxious toleave the country, and half  are  either undecided or content to  remain.   Theremaining 10,000 left Iraq in 1933  and were temporarily  settled  by  the french authorities on the Upper Khabur River (in the north-east corner of Syria), in anticipation of their ultimate permanent settlement in the Ghab area (in thestate of Lattakia).  The Ghab scheme has now been abandoned.       [15164]                                                      B
    Any  suggestion  that  the provisional  Khabur  settlement  should  becomepermanent, or be enlarged, would be strongly opposed by the Turkish Govern-ment, and might not be expected to be welcome to Syrian Nationalist opinion andto the Iraqi Government.    A complete solution must, therefore, deal with 30,000 Assyrians in all.    4.  The history and present position of the question, including its financial aspect, will be found summarised in the  Foreign Office memorandum which isattached as Appendix I to the present Report.Possibilities of Settlement.    5.  The  possibilities of  settlement may be  considered under the following heads:-                           -         (a) Settlement in foreign countries.         (b) Settlement in the British Colonial Empire.         (c) Settlement in the British Dominions.    The Indian  Empire, as a possible home for Assyrian  refugees, need  be mentioned only to be dismissed.Settlement in foreign countries.    6.  As stated in  paragraph 2, it has  proved impossible to proceed with theschemes which have so far  been  examined  by the Council Committee.  In thecourse of examining these schemes, however, League  representatives  have made enquiries on the spot in a number of countries.    The question is whether there is any prospect of success in countries not yetspecifically  considered  by  the  League  Committee.   As  is pointed  out  inAppendix I,  it may well be that there are other countries in which space existsto establish a home for the Assyrians, if the Governments concerned were preparedto receive them.  We are afraid, however,  that for  a variety of  reasons mostGovernments would hesitate to try  the experiment.  There will usually  be  suchinsuperable obstacles as an unsuitable climate or an unfavourable economicsituation  in the  country concerned,  the dislike of a European population  toreceiving an Asiatic community, or the unwillingness of  a Moslem or Soviet or&quot; totalitarian &quot;  State to see a self-contained Christian  community  preservingwithin its borders a separate religious and racial existence.The Middle and Near East.    7.  It occurred to us that before envisaging the  removal of the Assyriansto distant quarters  of the globe, at great expense, we ought to exhaust the possi-bilities of countries in the neighbourhood of Iraq, where the expenses incurredwould be much less, and climatic conditions  and modes  of life  might be moresimilar.  We have accordingly invited the Foreign Office to make special enquiries into three possibilities in the Middle or Near East:   (a)  Persia, (b)  the Erivandistrict,  and  (c) the Hakkiari territory, i.e., the former home of  the  Assyrians.    8.  We attach (Appendix II) a further Memorandum by the Foreign Officeshowing the result of these specific enquiries.  It may be summarised as follows : Persia.    9.  A number of Nestorian Christians, who form  part of the Assyriancommunity for religious purposes, have always lived in North-West Persia.. These&quot; Persian &quot; Assyrians are in disfavour with the authorities as a result of their activities during  the War, and many of them have since then  emigrated to Iraq.Those who remain are kept under strict supervision and are likely  to experienceincreasing difficulty in preserving their separate identity.     The Persian Government were approached some years ago regarding thepossibility of their receiving the  Iraq Assyrians,  but  the conditions  which thatGovernment demanded were even more unfavourable than those under which the assyrians were living in Iraq.        &apos;
The Erivan district:                              ..    10.  It  seems most unlikely that the  essential  condition of the Assyriansretaining their identity as a community and  a church could be fulfilled in theErivan, or Armenian district of Trans-Caucasia which forms part of the soviet union.                                                  ,The Hakkiari territory.    11.  The Turkish  Government have consistently refused  to consider a settle-ment of the  Assyrians  in Turkish territory, whether in the Hakkiari district or elsewhere.    Presumably,  therefore, the proposal would be that the Turco-Iraqi frontiershould be adjusted so as to bring the Hakkiari territory within Iraq, and thus tomake their former home available to the Assyrians.                             -;-    Unfortunately, Iraq has  no attractive counter-cession to offer to Turkey.&apos;Even  if she  had, there is  no reason to suppose  that  she would wish  to  cedeterritory in order to benefit the Assyrians.  Nor on the Turkish side would there be any willingness to alter a boundary which was finally fixed in  1925, after somefighting and very difficult negotiations.    12.  The three  possibilities which we invited the Foreign Office to investigatethus offei no hope.    13.  Appendix  II contains also an  examination of  certain other  newpossibilities,  namely, Brazil, Portuguese Africa,  Paraguay  (or some other  lessadvanced South American country) and finally the Lebanon.   In  the first  two cases a proposal has been made to the Government concerned  and has been firmlyrefused.  In  the case of Paraguay the political instability and backwardness ofthe country  are such that it would be imprudent to proceed, even in the event ofthe Paraguayan authorities welcoming the  suggestion of an Assyrian settlement.The same is true of  the other less advanced  South American countries.    The only slight possibility remaining  is that it may become practicable atsome future date to move to the Lebanon the Assyrians now temporarily accom-accommodated on  the Khabur River.  This would only become feasible in the event ofan improvement in  the political situation in the-French mandated  territories inthe Levant.    14.  In view of the formidable difficulties which we have outlined we have come to the conclusion  that there is at present no foreign country which would beready to take the Assyrians,  or  on which effective  pressure could be placed totake them.A lleged special responsibility of His Majesty&apos;s Government.    15.  We  must  now examine the view, which we understand is widely heldabroad, that the United Kingdom has a  special liability in this  matter,  and,further, that we should have no difficulty, if we were so disposed, in finding room for the Assyrians within our  own territories.   There is reason to fear that  thisview is shared by  the  Council Committee at Geneva, since they have  recentlyrenewed their appeal  to His Majesty&apos;s  Government to  find  a home  for the assyrians.    In the first place,  it is important to emphasise that we have, in fact,  no legalresponsibility for the Assyrians.  There is no foundation whatever for suggestions to the effect that failure to provide them  with a new home would amount  to a breach of faith on our part.  The responsibility for the present deplorable situationdoes not arise from any action or decision  of ours. In fact it has followed  froma decision of the Council  of the League  of  Nations.  If in 1925 the league council had taken  our advice, and had fixed the Mosul frontier so as to includethe Hakkiari territory within the boundaries  of Iraq, the Assyrians might havebeen satisfactorily  resettled in their old home as a homogeneous community.  Inall probability the Assyrian problem then might have been permanently and satis-factorily solved.     In the second place, we have no doubt that it is the mere size of the BritishEmpire on the map which suggests to those who are unfamiliar with our institu-tions that there can be no difficulty in finding room within its confines for a few thousand refugees.   Such critics  are, of course, ignorant or forgetful both of the       [15164]                                                    B  2
status of the great self-governing Dominions and of the fact that it is our settled policy to administer the non-self-governing parts of the Empire with the objectof promoting the interests of  the politically-undeveloped  or  backward racesalready living within them, whose trustees we have become.    16.   If, however, we are under no legal obligation to the Assyrians, we cannotdisinterest ourselves  in their welfare when we consider their part in the War andthe faithful service which they  have rendered us as levies during the period inwhich our forces have been stationed in Iraq.  So long then as the Assyriansremain in Iraq, and  we continue to occupy a special position in that country, weshall be concerned in their welfare.    In addition, any further outbreaks of violence between the Assyrians and theirKhurdish or  Arab  neighbours  might have  grave repercussions.  They might possibly even  endanger our position in the  country  and make it necessary to despatch a British expeditionary force.    It is unnecessary to point  out that Iraq is an important source of oil supplies and an essential link in our air communications with the East.Settlement in the British Colonial Empire.    17.   In the light of these considerations we turn to our examination of thepossibilities of settlement in the British Colonial Empire.  We attach a Memo-randum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies (Appendix III) which shows theresult of  the  exhaustive inquiries which were made  in  1933  regarding thepossibility of settling all or some of the Iraq Assyrians in Cyprus, Mauritius andSeychelles, the East  African dependencies, Malaya or Palestine.  It also refers to the endeavour made by the  British Government in  1934 to provide a home forthe Assyrians in the Rupununi  district of British Guiana.  This project  wasactively pursued by the local authorities, but had eventually to be abandonedbecause  a Mission of Enquiry, which was appointed by the League of Nations toexamine the question on the  spot, reported that the district, mainly on account ofpaucity  of fertile soil, was definitely unsuitable for the purpose.    It will be seen that in the opinion of the Secretary of State for the Colonies,which we share,  there are conclusive arguments against an attempt to transplantthe Assyrians  to any of these territories.    18.   In view, however, of  the seriousness of the situation, we have invited theSecretary of State for the  Colonies to cause additional  inquiry to  be made in cyprus, Aden  and Northern  Rhodesia.   We attach a further Memorandum givingthe results of this special inquiry (Appendix  IV).   It may be summarised asfollows : Cyprus.    19.   Cyprus must now be  definitely ruled  out of the list  of countries for investigation.  It is the  view  of the Governor  that the arrival in the  island ofany mission of investigation in this connection would give rise to political excite-meut  and might cause lasting  harm.  The Secretary of State informs us  that he regards Cyprus as the least suitable of all parts of the Colonial Empire for the projected settlement.Aden.    20.   The  Resident at Aden reports that the transfer of the Iraq Assyriansto the  Protectorate would interfere  with the attempt to  develop &quot;indirectcontrol &quot; through the local chiefs, i.e., the form of government which is now the established policy. .    In any event, the arrival of settlers alien in race and religion would be greatlyresented.  From  the economic  point  of view,  again,  the means by which anAssyrian colony could obtain a livelihood in the Protectorate appear to be lacking.From the military point of view, there  is no need for the additional defence force which it has been suggested the Assyrians might  form.Northern Rhodesia.    21.   In  addition  to economic and climatic  objections,  the Governor ofNorthern  Rhodesia gives reasons for considering that the mass  immigration ofan Asiatic community would be  strongly resented.
Nyasaland Protectorate.    22.  Apart from political objections, we are advised that it would be most unwise to settle Assyrians in the only two possibly suitable areas, until exhaustiveenquiries over a long period  on  the  spot  had been made  as to  whether any settlement would be economically practicable.    23.  To the best  of our  belief, there are no  further  possibilities  in  theColonial Empire which it would be profitable  to investigate.Settlement in the British Dominions.    24.  The Dominion  Governments  are, of course, entirely  free agents.  Wefear that none of them are likely to welcome the Assyrians  to their territories,or that their public opinion would permit them to do so.  They have all, in fact,given  unfavourable  replies  to previous  enquiries on  the part of the League.Moreover, to settle the Assyrians in the self-governing British Dominions wouldmean in  every case long journeys, the certainty of climatic and social conditionsentirely different from those  to which  the Assyrians are accustomed, and heavycosts.    25.  The only conceivable possibility, and that a remote one, is  that  the assyrians  might be admitted  to  Northern Australia.   The  best  method  of approaching the Government of the Commonwealth of  Australia on the subjectappeared to be to sound the Commonwealth Ministers on their arrival in London,more particularly as Mr.  Casey, the Commonwealth Treasurer, is understood tobe interested in the  question of settlement in Northern Australia.    The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs proposes to discuss the matterinformally with Mr. Casey.Summary of Conclusions.    26.  Our Report, then, must be a negative one.  It may be summarised asfollows :     (i) His Majesty&apos;s Government ought not to be regarded as under any special           responsibility for finding a home for the  Assyrians.  If is deplorable           if no satisfactory plan of settlement can be found for them, but there           will be no breach of faith if we find ourselves unable to  provide them           with a home.    (ii) Their present plight  is largely to be explained  by the way in which the           Turco-Iraqi boundary was  drawn in 1925, when the former home of           the Assyrians  was assigned to Turkey.  Our  recommendation as  to           the boundary was not followed on that occasion.   (iii) The  United Kingdom, however,  for reasons  both  of justice and  of           expediency, would greatly desire to  see a satisfactory solution  of  the           problem.   (iv) We have considered numerous possibilities,  in  the British Empire and           in foreign countries, and have made careful inquiries,  but find our-           selves unable  to offer  any suggestion as  to  a new home for the           Assyrians.  The numerous schemes of settlement which have been put           forward in recent years have all had to be abandoned as impracticable.    (v) So  far as we can  discover,  only one possibility  remains to  be examined,           viz.,  the  northern  part of Australia.  The Secretary  of State  for           Dominion Affairs  has undertaken to  sound Commonwealth Ministers           regarding this possibility during the coming Imperial Conference.           We fear,  however, that the prospects of a favourable answer being           received  from  the Commonwealth are very remote.   (vi) Subject to  (v),  we can only recommend that a negative reply be sent  to           the Committee of  the League  Council, so far  as  the  provision of a           home for  the Assyrians  in the British Empire is concerned.   (vii) We fear that the only course remaining  to the  League  Council  is  to           negotiate  with the  Government  of  Iraq with a  view  to obtaining           improved  conditions for the Assyrians in Iraqi territory.                                   Signed on behalf of  the Committee :                                               JOHN  SIMON,  Chairman.    2  Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,            May 5, 1937.
                              APPENDIX I.SECRET.A.I. (37) 3.CABINET.COMMITTEE ON THE ASSYRIANS IN IRAQ.                            ASSYRIAN  QUESTION.Memorandum prepared in the Foreign Office and circulated by direction of the                   Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.                          I. Historical Summary.    IT may be  useful  to  attempt to  summarise  as  briefly as possible thecircumstances in which it has been felt necessary to consider afresh the possibilityof settling the Assyrians of  Iraq in the Colonial Empire.    2.  It is unnecessary to go at this stage in  any detail into the history ofthe Assyrian question before the termination of the Mandatory  regime in  Iraq.It will be sufficient to recall the gallant part played by the  Assyrians duringthe war,  the manner in which the remnant of them were rescued and broughtto Iraq by the British forces operating in Persia;  their maintenance in Iraqfor a considerable period at British  expense;  the efforts made to  settle  them at the end of the war in their old homes in  the Hakkiari territory  in Turkey;.the repeated attempts made by  His Majesty&apos;s  Government, in connection withthe fixing of the Mosul frontier,  to secure the inclusion of the Hakkiari territorywithin the boundaries of Iraq, first by negotiation with the Turkish Governmentand then by an appeal to the Council of the League; the adverse decision of theCouncil in 1925 which in the British  view destroyed any hope of the settlementof the Assyrians as a homogeneous community;  the  subsequent attempts to  settlethem suitably  in  Iraq;  the  difficulties encountered owing to  the conflict ofprinciple involved, namely, the desire of the Assyrians on the one side not merely for religious, but, if possible, for national, and at all events  administrative,autonomy and on the other side  the necessity for Iraq&apos;s existence as  a  nation ofwelding together the various racial and religious entities of which  the countryis composed;  the growing apprehension of the Assyrians as the time for thetermination of the Mandatory regime drew  near,  culminating  in the so-calledmutiny of the Levies in 1932, despite guarantees which the Council of the Leaguehad meanwhile obtained from the  Iraqi Government regarding the treatment of minorities after the termination of the Mandatory regime.     3.  When  the admission of  Iraq to membership of the League took place onthe 3rd October, 1932, carrying with it the termination of the Mandatory regimethere were outstanding a number of petitions  to the  League from  Assyrian repre-sentatives in Iraq, designed to secure either the transfer of the  Assyrians from iraq or their settlement in that country in accordance with their  own wishes, i.e..with some form of administrative autonomy.  These petitions were considered bythe Council of the League towards the end of 1932.  The Council in a decisionof the 15th  December, 1932, rejected the idea of Assyrian autonomy  within iraq and came to the conclusion that the root of the whole trouble lay in unsatisfactory
land settlement.    The  Iraqi  Government thereupon undertook  to  appoint aforeign expert to assist in carrying out  the settlement of landless Assyrians inIraq under suitable conditions, and as  far  as possible in homogeneous units,without  prejudice to the rights of the  existing population.   The Council, intaking note of this decision, expressed confidence that if these measures  did not provide  a complete solution  of the problem,  and there remained  Assyriansunwilling or unable to settle in Iraq, the Iraqi Government would take all possible measures to facilitate the settlement of such Assyrians elsewhere.     4.  In pursuance of this  resolution, a British  officer, Major Thomson, wasappointed  as  Settlement  Expert and began  to work  out a  settlement  scheme.Subsequent developments are well known.   The Assyrian Patriarch Mar Shimunshowed uncompromising  opposition to the work of re-settlement and continuedto press for the establishment of the Assyrians as a compact national group.  this attitude encouraged extremists on the other side and the atmosphere became tenseand embittered.  A number of armed Assyrians crossed over into Syria and,re-crossing into Iraq on the 4th August, 1933,  became involved in fighting withIraqi troops.   This fighting was followed by a massacre of Assyrians and thelooting of Assyrian villages.  Mar Shimun was deported and the whole deplorablesituation came before the Council of the League in September 1933 in virtue ofthe minority guarantees  which Iraq had  given to the Council  before her entry into the League.     5.  The Council of the League then decided that the situation was  far tooconfused and  complicated to make  it practicable to fix responsibility, and thatthe essential thing was to find an honourable and lasting solution for the future.It considered that the eventuality foreseen in its resolution of the 15th December,1932, of  attempting to settle outside Iraq those Assyrians who wished to leavethe country had arisen and,  acting on a request by  the Iraqi Government forassistance in the  matter,  it set up a committee of six of its members, includingthe United Kingdom, to examine whether such a solution was practicable and, if so, to work it  out.     6.  This Committee has been at work ever since and there have been times when it appeared to be within an ace of success.  A promising scheme in Brazilbroke down owing to local political opposition.  Thereupon, at the suggestion ofHis  Majesty&apos;s  Government, a League mission of enquiry  was  sent out to thehinterland of  British Guiana.   But  this mission  decided  that the physicaldifficulties were too great to offer a serious prospect of successful settlement withinmeasurable time and on  a sufficiently large scale.  The  utmost which it couldsuggest was a small experimental settlement  over an indefinite period and thisclearly offered no  solution to the problem.     7.  Meanwhile, all likely  Governments, including those of the Dominions,had  been approached by the Council Committee without success, and in the last resort, the Committee appealed to  the French Government to  reconsider their earlier objections to taking the Assyrians in the Mandated  Territories of the levant. A certain number of Assyrians had found refuge in Syria in the summer of 1933 and were provisionally settled by the French authorities on the UpperKhabur River in  the north-east corner of Syria.  The French Government wereeventually induced to consider the settlement of Assyrians on a larger scale and a plan was worked  out in the Ghab Valley on  the River Orontes in the State ofLattakia.   It  was  an expensive scheme,  involving  large-scale  drainage andirrigation works, but, owing to the lead given by His Majesty&apos;s Government, who,on condition that  the Iraqi Government made an equal contribution and that theLeague also contributed,  offered up  to  250,000, a large  amount of the expensewas  covered; and  it seemed that a lasting solution of the problem was, at length,in sight.  Unfortunately,  the serious and widespread  political  agitation whichbroke out in Syria  in the beginning of 1936 changed the  whole picture.  TheFrench Government were  obliged to agree to the incorporation of the State  ofLattakia in the predominantly Moslem  State of Syria and to accelerate  theemancipation of Syria from the Mandate.   In these circumstances  they were obliged to inform the League in June of last year that they found themselvesunable to proceed with the Ghab scheme.
    8.  The unexpected collapse  of that scheme  left the  Council  Committeewithout any visible hope of success.  The situation in Iraq has, it is true, been somewhat relieved by the  removal to the Khabur,  in anticipation of ultimatepermanent settlement in the Ghab area, of the more destitute and discontentedelements among the Assyrians in Iraq.  But the Khabur settlement is, and was always intended to be, only provisional.  Owing  to its remote situation in apredominantly Moslem State, it is impossible not to have some misgivings about its security after the  termination of the French mandate, though the reports ofrecent independent observers have been more  reassuring in this respect.  But,apart from Syrian nationalist  opinion, its  establishment and  enlargement as apermanency would meet with opposition from the  Turkish and Iraqi  Govern-ments, both of whom object to its present location as being  too near  to  theirfrontiers.  Efforts have accordingly been made  by discreet enquiry to see whethera place cannot be found in the predominantly Christian State of  the Lebanon,where the Khabur Assyrians and the rest of the Iraqi  Assyrians who wish toleave  Iraq might be settled.  The French Government were privately approached by His Majesty&apos;s Government last summer and, though rejecting  settlement inthe Lebanon as an immediate possibility, on account of political difficulties, theywere  eventually induced to give an  unofficial assurance that  they would  beprepared to lend their assistance to the idea  if and when the present politicaleffervescence subsided.  But it is  now unfortunately only too  clear that settle-ment  in the Lebanon is not immediately practical politics, if, indeed,  it ever willbe; and perhaps the utmost that can be hoped for is that those Assyrians now on the Khabur may, in the  course of time, be gradually removed to a more securehome  in the  Lebanon.  But  the  introduction  into  the Lebanon  of  furtherAssyrians from Iraq would be likely to rouse vigorous opposition from the Syriannationalists.    9.  It may be mentioned that enquiries made of the Assyrians in connectionwith the Ghab scheme showed that, apart from those now settled temporarily onthe Khabur, numbering some 9,000 persons, a further 10,000 Assyrians wished toleave  Iraq,  while  some 9-10,000  were either  undecided or content to remainin that country.  A certain  number of those wishing  to  be transferred areartisans, e.g.,  stone masons.  But the majority require land, partly for  cultiva-tion, but mainly for pasture.    10.  The  possibility of settlement within the Colonial Empire has  been several times  under review, and more particularly since the breakdown of theGhab scheme.   In the case  of every Colonial territory, the introduction of a newelement inevitably raises questions of technical or  political  difficulty.   Afterprolonged consideration of various  alternatives,  the Colonial  Office  recentlyagreed in principle, in response to the urgent representations  of the  ForeignOffice, to an investigation on the spot into the physical possibilities of settlement in Cyprus, leaving the political questions involved  for later examination shouldthe project be found physically practicable.  But in view of the considerationssince  urged by the  Governor  of  Cyprus,  and, in particular,  the  danger  ofpremature publicity, the Colonial Office do not see their way to pursue the idea..The Foreign Office fully appreciate the dangers and difficulties that might attach to a public enquiry.  But it had never been their intention to suggest this.   Whatwas in their mind was not a League enquiry, or indeed a public enquiry of any kind,  but discreet investigations by someone of the type of Major Thomson withpersonal knowledge of Assyrian settlement work.    11.  It may be that there are foreign countries where space  exists in whicha home for the Assyrians could be established, if the Government of the country concerned were prepared to receive them.  But the general economic situationdoes not encourage Governments to try the experiment.  Moreover, there is a natural hesitation  on  political grounds to   receive a  little  known  Asiaticcommunity,  and more particularly  one for which Great Britain is regarded as having a special liability, and which she, more than other nations, in view of hervast Territories, is believed to  have room to  accommodate.  There  is  thus  noforeign Government which  is known to be ready to consider taking the Assyrians-or upon which effective pressure can be placed to take them.
                            II. Present Position.    12.  The position now is in  fact that, unless some place can be found forthe Assyrians  in  the Colonial  Empire, the  Council  Committee will almost certainly throw in its hand.  It  will feel obliged to report to the Council itsinability to find a place of settlement outside Iraq and those Assyrians who havenot already been transferred to Syria will have to remain in Iraq.    13.  Faced  with  this  prospect, the Foreign  Office  have  recently  been considering the possibility of some resettlement scheme in  Iraq itself, wherebythose  Assyrians who  are  most isolated and most exposed  to danger might betransferred to places of greater security.  No  doubt the investigations begun by major Thomson in 1932 could be turned to good account, and though the expenseof the operation cannot yet be  estimated, it is admittedly likely to be less thanjthat involved in any scheme outside the boundaries of Iraq.  But it would leavethe fundamental problem unsolved.  It is true that the time which has been takenin investigating the possibilities of settlement  outside Iraq has allowed passionsto cool to some extent,  and it may be that the Assyrians might live in peace for an indefinite period of time,  but the risk which led  the  League to contemplate the exceptional  measure  of  transferring   the  Assyrians outside  Iraq,  and  HisMajesty&apos;s Government to offer to contribute so large a sum to this end, would still remain.  There is, in  any case, no certainty that an attempt at resettlement inIraq would not meet with difficulties very similar to  those which brought aboutthe breakdown of  Major  Thomson&apos;s efforts in 1932.   The effort  to  settle the assyrians compactly,  for  their greater  security,  might,  indeed, only encouragetheir  autonomist tendencies.   Moreover, there  would certainly be a demand in geneva for some form of League supervision and this  would be sure to createfriction between the League and the Iraqi Government, who are determined notto accept such supervision.  Apart from this  aspect of  the matter, the attitudeof the Iraqi Government towards  a resettlement scheme in Iraq is not yet known and it has not so far been  considered expedient to sound them on the point.  TheGovernment of Yasin  Pasha which was recently overthrown took the line thatthey could not allow to remain in Iraq  those Assyrians who had opted to leavethe country.  There is  some reason to believe that the  present Government wouldbe less harsh.  On the  other hand, there is no reason to suppose that they wouldbe willing to incur fresh expenditure unless it were to rid them once and for all of the Assyrian problem.   It might be an inducement to them if some of themoney.offered for the  Ghab  scheme by His Majesty&apos;s Government and by theLeague could be devoted to the purpose.  But it is  unlikely that the League wouldbe prepared to spend  in this manner its contribution, which was only obtainedwith the greatest difficulty to solve an exceptional problem by exceptional means,i.e., the transfer of the Assyrians  outside Iraq.  If the Assyrians remain in Iraqthey will continue to be a minority and a League contribution for the bettermentof a minority in its own country might create a most awkward precedent. Againit is doubtful to what extent Parliament, any more than the League itself, wouldbe prepared to agree that the contribution voted for the Ghab scheme should beused for settlement in Iraq,  seeing that such settlement could not be regardedas guaranteeing the future  security of the  Assyrians and thereby offering a lasting solution of the problem.    14.  It is not on account of these various incidental difficulties in themselves,but because  of  the reactions  on the interests  of  His  Majesty&apos;s Government, if those  Assyrians who are unwilling to remain  in  Iraq are obliged  to stay there,that the Foreign Office feel bound to urge most strongly that a further effort shouldbe made to see whether the obstacles to settlement within the  Colonial Empirecannot be overcome.    15.  The  Foreign Office are only  too well aware of  the  difficulties, bothphysical and political, of introducing the Assyrians  into any  British  colonial territory.  But physical difficulties may yield to financial treatment on the analogy of the Ghab scheme.   Moreover,  it may be pointed out that, since the war, the assyrians have always desired to maintain the British connection, and there is every  reason to believe that under British rule they would have no thought of autonomy and would be loyal and useful  colonists.       [15164]           &apos;                                            c
    10.  On the political side, there is, in the first place, our own good name tobe considered.   It is true that His Majesty&apos;s Government have never admitted aspecial responsibility for the Assyrians,  but they are held almost universally tohave that responsibility, and this fact is coupled with the difficulty which foreign powers find in believing that, given the will, a  place  for. a mere handful ofAssyrians (20,000 at most) cannot be found within the Colonial Empire.    17.  His Majesty&apos;s Government have, in fact, no legal responsibility for the assyrians, to whom no pledges have been given.  Even the oft-quoted remark bySir F. Humphrys about &quot; moral responsibility &quot; does not bear the interpretationthat Assyrian sympathisers have  attributed to it.  Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that  His Majesty&apos;s Government are specially concerned with the fate ofthis people owing to long association and the loyal services which the Assyrianshave given as levies in Iraq.   Had the employment of the Assyrian levies ceasedwith the mandatory regime in Iraq, the case might have been less strong, but thevery fact that His  Majesty&apos;s Government continued to  employ Assyrian  leviesinvolves a special obligation.    18.  But the case for finding a home for the Assyrians under British controlrests  chiefly on  our  imperial interests.  Failure to  achieve  a  satisfactorypermanent  solution of the question is fraught with potential consequences ofconsiderable danger to His Majesty&apos;s Government.  So long as the Assyriansremain in Iraq there is an ever-present risk of their becoming involved in furthertrouble with their Khurdish or Arab neighbours.   And so long as His Majesty&apos;sGovernment occupy their special position in Iraq, and more particularly so longas the Royal Air Force  is stationed  in that country and employs Assyrians toguard its air bases, His Majesty&apos;s  Government cannot disinterest themselves inthe fate of  the Assyrian community.  Furthermore, should trouble break outagain,  its repercussions might well be wide, since an anti-Assyrian movementmight easily become anti-Christian, and  even anti-foreign.  Such a  developmentwas what was feared  by all competent observers in 1933,  and it was estimated bythe head of the British military mission in Iraq that intervention by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment might ultimately involve the despatch to Iraq of an expeditionaryforce of 100,000  men.  On that  occasion it was possible to  avoid  intervention(though with very great loss of prestige) because  Geneva acted as a  safety-valve.But with the resources of Geneva exhausted, a second outbreak would be a very different affair.    19.  The point then which the Foreign Office wish to urge is  that againstthe local disadvantages and risks of any particular scheme in the Colonial empire should be weighed the very heavy risk, from the imperial point of view, involvedin failure to find a solution.   Iraq is,  imperially, a key point.    It is a mostimportant source of oil supplies and an essential link in our air communications with the East.  Any further Assyrian trouble might have very unfortunate conse-quences for  the supply of oil  at Haifa for  the Navy and might place the  RoyalAir Force squadrons  in Iraq  in a difficult and dangerous  situation.  Our whole position in  Iraq and the Middle East might well be prejudiced in  a mannercalling  for military operations on the large scale indicated  above.   With the breakdown of all other attempts to solve the problem, the time has therefore cometo review the  possibility of Assyrian settlement  in the  Colonial Empire.   It is recognised that to any scheme there are likely to be substantial local objections.But in  examining the problem, it is suggested that it is necessary to take intoaccount also the widest considerations of imperial policy and interests.Foreign Office,      January 25, 1937.
SECEET.A.I. (37) 5.CABINET.COMMITTEE ON  THE ASSYRIANS  IN  IRAQ.                   Memorandum by Viscount Cranborne.    AT the first meeting, held on the 27th January,  1937, of the Committee ofthe Cabinet set up to consider the position of the Assyrians in Iraq, it was agreed(Conclusion (i)) that I  should  consider and report to the Committee on  thepossibility of Assyrian settlement in Persia and the Erivan territory of the soviet union, and also on the  suggestion that Turkey  might exchange the Hakkiariterritory for some Iraq territory so as to enable the Assyrians to be settled in theHakkiari.    The attached memorandum is circulated in  accordance  with the  aboveConclusion.    Foreign Office, April  19, 1937.                         THE  ASSYRIAN QUESTION.    THE Committee of the Cabinet on the Assyrians in Iraq adopted at its firstmeeting,  on the 27th January,  the  following conclusion  directly concerning theForeign Office :     &quot; (1) To request Lord Cranborne to consider and report to the Committee           on  the possibility of Assyrian settlement in  Persia and the Erivan           territory of the Soviet Union, and also on the suggestion that Turkey        &quot;   might exchange the Hakkiari territory for some Iraq territory so as.           to enable the Assyrians  to be settled in the Hakkiari.&quot;    The results  of the  reconsideration in the Foreign Office of the three possi-bilities mentioned in the conclusion can be summarised as follows :-     2.  Persia. A considerable number of the Nestorian Christians forming part of the Assyrian community for religious purposes have always lived to the.West of Lake Urumiah (now Lake  Rezaieh) in North-West Persia. During theGreat War they became involved in the fighting on Persian territory between themain body of Assyrians from Turkey  and  Turkish  forces, aided  by  the neighbouring Moslem Kurdish population.  Many of the so-called &apos;&apos; Persian &apos;&apos;Assyrians fled to Iraq with the ex-Ottoman Assyrians, and have been living there as refugees ever since.   As a result of these events and of the close  connection ofthe Assyrians with His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Persian authorities are little less suspicious of the Assyrians than the Turks themselves.  The Assyrians whoremain in Persia live under very strict supervision from the Persian authorities,and are  likely to have increasing difficulty in maintaining  their separate racialand religious  identity in the future as  &quot; totalitarianism &quot; spreads throughoutPersia.     3.  Nevertheless,  in  1932, the possibility  of  all  the  Assyrians  in  Iraqemigrating to Persia was put  up  privately to the Persian Government by anAssyrian sympathiser (Captain Rassam).  The Persian Government did not reject       [15164]                                                     c  2
the idea outright, but laid  down stringent conditions which would apparentlyhave meant that the Assyrians could only be settled in the eastern part of Persiain very small scattered and disarmed groups and as tenant cultivators without theright to own land.  Nor would any foreign organisation be permitted to intervene in  the  question  of their settlement.  These  conditions  were so  much  moreunfavourable than those obtaining in Iraq  that the matter was not pursued.    4.  Lately,  the Iraqi Government have been studying  the  possibility of inducing the Persian Government  to take back  some at least of the Assyrianrefugees of Persian origin, and it is possible that  something may be accomplishedin this  direction.   But it is inconceivable that the Persian Government would substantially modify their already  expressed  conditions  in the case of  theex-Ottoman Assyrians with whom  the  Committee  of the League of Nations is strictly speaking alone concerned,   Even  if the Persians could  be  induced tomodify these conditions, there would remain all  the risks and difficulties which an ancient minority community like the  Assyrians would find in dealing with thepresent &quot;totalitarian&quot; regime  in  Persia, and a proposal to remove them to anew home where, without acquiring any better  security or prosperity  than inIraq, they might well find it impossible to maintain their existence as a distinctcommunity with their own Christian church is one which could hardly be main-tained either in this country or at Geneva.    5.  The Erivan  (or Armenian) District (Southern  Trans-Caucasia) of theSoviet Union. There is  evidence  that in 1934  the Russians were consideringperfunctorily  the  idea  of using  the  Assyrians  as  settlers for  this region.(Numerous Assyrians are said to be living already in Southern Russia, whitherthey  retreated during the Great War,  but their present political and materialcircumstances are unknown.)  Since then considerable success seems to have been attained in  the settlement around Erivan of refugee Armenians on waste landsreclaimed by extensive irrigation works.  There has lately been no sign  that theRussians are still taking any interest  in the Assyrians, and it seems doubtfulwhether they would be prepared to offer them a home if approached by the League.    6.  The main objection to any project for settlement in Soviet territory is again the ruthless &quot; totalitarian &quot;  character of the Communist  regime, whichgoes  much  further than  either the Turkish or  Persian Governments in itscampaign against  organised religion.  It would be very difficult  to  take  any responsibility for using League funds (composed partly of a British contribution)to settle the Assyrians  in Soviet territory, even though  it is true that the  anti-religious movement may  not yet have gained its full force in outlying regionssuch  as Southern Trans-Caucasia.   It seems only too likely that  here again the assyrians would eventually lose their identity as a community and a church.     7.   Suggested adjustment of the Turco-Iraqi frontier (to bring the Hakkiariterritory within Iraq  and available for  resettlement  of the Assyrians). Thefrontier between Turkey and Iraq  was only arrived at after great  difficulty and  a  good deal of  sporadic  fighting in 1924-25 between  British forces  and turkish bands  who  had penetrated into  the Mosul Vilayet.  The  line of  thefrontier was finally  based on the  decision of the  League Council of December 1925, which was itself  based on the  report of a  League Commission of Enquirysent  to the  Mosul Vilayet.  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government had already in  1924unsuccessfully tried to  induce the Turks to leave to Iraq the Assyrian homelandsin the  Hakkiari district.   The Council&apos;s  decision saved the Mosul Vilayet for Iraq, but allotted the Hakkiari district to Turkey, despite British  protests.    -  8.   When the frontier came to be delimited on the spot the Turks showed the utmost rigidity about the location of the boundary line.  They insisted, moreover, that  the settlement should not be open  to revision  and should be absolutely final, and  in this they obtained the agreement of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Iraqi Government.   To-day, Turkey is once more showing a tendency to expand and  it seems inconceivable that she would  even listen to a suggestion for frontier revision, particularly as  discussion of  this question in the past has shown that Iraq has nothing  sufficiently attractive to offer to Turkey by way of counter- cession in return for Hakkiari.  It would in any case be difficult to see how the Iraqi Government could in principle give up any part of their territory to benefit the disliked Assyrians.
     9.  Apart from the basic impossibility of any such frontier adjustment the Turkish Government have in practice consistently opposed the readmission of the Assyrians into the Hakkiari or  any other part  of  Turkish territory.   A large part of the Assyrians did return to this district during the years immediately after the war, when it lay  unadministered between Turkey and Iraq, but they were driven out again by the Turks in 1924-25, and the attitude of the Turkish Government towards the Assyrians has certainly not become any more favourable subsequently.   They regard  the Assyrians  as rebels  and potential  enemies and they consistently protest against  their presence in. the temporary Khabur settle- ment in Syria on the ground that  it is too close to the Turkish  frontier.   In response  to an enquiry  last summer from the Foreign  Office His  Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Angora  expressed the opinion that there was no possibility of the  Turkish Government reconsidering their attitude  towards the readmission of the Assyrians, particularly as they were  now engaged  in opening-up their eastern provinces and would not wish to add to the difficulty of assimilating the existing non-Turkish  elements.   Finally,  in  September last,  in  reply  to  an initiative taken by the  Iraqi Minister  for Foreign Affairs during a visit to Angora, the Turkish Government flatly  refused  to consider a settlement of the Assyrians in the Hakkiari  district  or anywhere  else in Turkey.     10.   In the light of  the position as summarised in the preceding paragraphs the Foreign Office cannot escape  the conclusion that the three possible solutions mentioned tentatively in  the conclusion of the Cabinet Committee would be either impracticable  or fundamentally unsuitable, and that there could be no advantage in pursuing them further.  .     11.   The  Foreign Office indicated in their memorandum of the 25th January, 1937, which was before the Committee at its first meeting,  that there appeared to be no foreign Government which would of its own accord be ready to take the Assyrians (take them, that is to say, on acceptable conditions), or upon which effective pressure could be brought to make them do so, and that the only slight remaining possibility among foreign countries lay in the chance that the political situation  in the French mandated territories in the Levant would improve in the future,  so as to permit the removal to the  Lebanon of at least those Assyrians now somewhat insecurely settled  on a provisional basis on the Khabur River in North-East Syria.     12.  Nothing has  occurred since the previous memorandum was written to modify this view, although the Foreign Office have once more reviewed all foreign territories not  automatically  excluded  by  political,  material  or   religious considerations.     13.  In particular, His  Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Rio  de Janeiro  has been consulted  about the possibility of reviving the scheme put forward in  1933  for the settlement of Assyrians in Brazil on lands belonging to a British company in the State  of Parana, which appeared suitable from the material point of view, but was vetoed  by the Brazilian Government in 1934 on  political and racial grounds following local agitation.   Sir H.  Gurney&apos;s reply shows that the strong local opposition to the emigration of Asiatics in general and of the Assyrians in particular is as strong as ever, and it appears quite hopeless to attempt  to revive the scheme.     14.  Paraguay has  also been suggested as a possible  destination  for the Assyrians, and it is  believed that  the Government  of that  country,  who are anxious to increase the population, have, in fact, been considering the possibility of taking  the Assyrians at the cost of the League settlement funds.   The Foreign Office do not consider it desirable, however, to give any encouragement to such a proposal, in view of the political instability and backwardness of Paraguay andthe uncertainty which would inevitably  surround the political and  economic future  of the Assyrian  community if it  were  transferred  there.  The  other countries of South A merica where settlement of the Assyrians would be physically possible, either (like the Argentine)  exclude in principle any organised, immigra- tion  by non-Europeans, or else are, like Paraguay,  clearly of  too primitive and unstable a character for  the League  and His Majesty&apos;s  Government to take any responsibility for transferring the Assyrians to them.
     15.  Outside  South  America, the only  remaining  physical  possibility  interritory under the control of a foreign Government (excluding the Lebanon, forwhich please see paragraph 11 above) appears to be in the Portuguese colonial territories  in  Africa.   But the Portuguese Government have already told theLeague formally that they reject in principle  the idea of taking the Assyrians.and it does not seem  practicable for His Majesty&apos;s  Government to bring any pressure upon them to revise their  attitude.   The physical  conditions in thePortuguese colonies of Angola and East Africa appear to be similar to those  inadjacent British colonies, and it would be most difficult  to urge the portuguese government  to reconsider  their attitude  if  the  possibility of  settlement  incorresponding British territory had been excluded.     16.  The  position is,  therefore, that the  only  remaining  possibility  ofresettling the Assyrians in satisfactory surroundings outside Iraq lies at present,or in the immediate future, in some scheme  materialising within some  british colonial  territory,  or  else  in  the Australian Government giving  favourable consideration  to the  possibility  of  settlement  in the  northern part  of theCommonwealth.     17.  Should no possibility of settlement in the Colonial Empire or Australiaemerge before the next session of the League Council in May, it may be necessaryto face the existing situation of fact, i.e., the presence of nearly 9,000 Assyriansin the provisional Khabur Settlement in Syria and of some 19,000 Assyrians stillin  Iraq.   With  regard  to  this possibility  it  is   only  fair  to add  thatMajor Thomson,  the  Assyrian settlement officer  in  Iraq,  who  has personalexperience  of the whole problem, has expressed the view that these Assyrians nowremaining  in Iraq  are not at present, and are not likely to be so  far as can  before seen in the near future, in any immediate danger in Iraq; while he is doubtfulwhether any ill results need inevitably be expected for those  Assyrians  now  inthe Khabur, if the Syrian Government were  to agree to allow them to  remainthere.  But though Major Thomson&apos;s  views naturally deserve close attention, and though it may be fairly stated that there is nothing in  them which could  be held to conflict  with the desirability of finding a permanent settlement of the whole problem in circumstances and in an  area where even a possible risk of  dangerfor the future could be definitely ruled out, it is also necessary to add that  otherobservers, equally  well qualified to judge, are less optimistic.  In any case thepossibility  cannot be excluded of further trouble developing in the future betweenthe Assyrians  and the surrounding Moslem population, or between the Assyriansand the authorities of  the Moslem Governments of  Iraq and Syria, under whosecontrol they will be living.     18.  If such trouble were to occur it could not fail to cause, as in 1933, serious.embarrassment to the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Iraq, and in theMiddle East generally.     Foreign Office, April 19,  1937.
SECRET.A.I. (37) 2.CABINET.COMMITTEE ON  THE  ASSYRIANS IN IRAQ.           Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    SINCE the termination of the  Iraq Mandate my predecessors and I havegiven the most earnest consideration to the problem of  the Assyrians  in  thatcountry and we have endeavoured to do everything in our power to  assist the assyrian Committee of the  League of Nations which was appointed in  October1933  to  consider the  possibility of settling these people in  other  countries,following the regrettable disturbances which had taken place in the earlier  partof that year.    In November 1933 Sir  Philip Cunliffe-Lister  caused enquiries to be madeas to  whether it would be possible to settle all or some of the Iraq Assyrians in cyprus, Mauritius and Seychelles, the East African Dependencies, Malaya and palestine, a project which, if it had been found practicable, would have been lessexpensive than arranging for their  settlement in Brazil, which country was atthat time being explored by the Assyrian Committee of the League of Nations.Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister,  however,  came to the conclusion  that to  settle the assyrians in any of the territories mentioned above would be impracticable forthe following reasons : Cyprus.    A very poor country which was faced with a serious local  unemployment problem.  Recent droughts  and trade depression had necessitated  government assistance  being given to  the  labouring classes throughout the island.  Theprovision of suitable land for  Assyrian settlement was  impracticable owing tothe peculiar local system of land tenure, and all available land was  already ownedand settled.  Moreover,  political and ethnological reasons rendered the intro-duction of another race highly undesirable.  The settlement of  British subjectseven had been found impracticable in the past, and a proposal to  settle an alienrace,  even  if land were available, would certainly evoke strong pi^tests locallyand give rise to formidable political  as well  as economic difficulties.Mauritius  and  Seychelles.    Mauritius  was  already densely  populated  and had serious  unemploymentproblems of its own.  Seychelles comprised a number of small  outlying islandswhich were Government property and were let on lease;  but their  total area and productivity were so small as to render them quite unsuitable, apart from the lackof communications which would render marketing an unsurmountable difficulty.Kenya and Uganda.    No  land  available.  The  Assyrians could  not  be  settled  in the  Kenya&quot;White Highlands&quot;  without a breach of  the  pledges given by  Plis  Majesty&apos;sGovernment in respect of European settlement, nor could they  be settled in thenative reserves.  In districts other than these the lack of  suitable  cultivable land and climatic conditions would make Assyrian  settlement impracticable.  Evenif the Assyrians were willing to settle down as labourers, without land  of their
own,  they  could hardly  compete with native African, or acclimatised  Indian,labour.   A very substantial  amount of capital  would moreover  be  required  toenable them to start on their own account, even if vacant land of  any value wereavailable.Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.    Northern Rhodesia was passing through a critical period of economic depres-sion and was not in a position to receive a large influx of alien settlers, even if theterritory were suitable for them.  The Assyrians were, however, accustomed to amountainous land, whereas Northern Rhodesia was not mountainous.  The  onlyhigh lands in the country were not available for  settlement,  consisting  as  theydid largely of native  reserves and  freehold estates.  In Nyasaland there  was already a shortage of  land  for occupation by natives, and the Government wasattempting to check the immigration of natives from adjoining Portuguese terri-tory.   No land could be found for the Assyrians.Tanganyika Territory.    In many of the Provinces climatic conditions  would rule  out the settlementof a working agricultural population of European or similar stock.    In theremaining  areas the extent of land already alienated was such as to cause acuteconcern  to the Administration owing to the inadequacy  of land for  nativepurposes.  The only area where non-native settlement on any scale was feasiblewas in the south-west corner of the  Territory.  That district had, however, notbeen reached by the railway; the land was emphatically not suitable for settlement by European agriculturalists without the necessary capital to provide themselves with machinery and native labour, and the settlement en masse of a populationwith some European characteristics would be exposed to all the ravages of tropicaldiseases, with which the local administration would have no resources to deal.The Assyrians would certainly not be able to maintain themselves in the labour market in competition  with the indigenous labour  supply, which  was already  inexcess of demand.Malaya.    So far as the  Colony of  the Straits Settlements was concerned, the Colonialhinterland was far too small to absorb a body  of several thousand persons, even ifit were not already well populated with Chinese and other immigrants in additionto the indigenous Malays.    In the Malay  States  the  various  Sultans  would naturally put the interests of their  own subjects foremost and would certainlyraise the strongest objections to  the proposal  to settle an alien minority in their territories, even if the country  was under-populated.  The various componentStates of the whole peninsula had recently passed legislation to control immi-gration.  All parts of  the  peninsula  were suffering from  unemployment,  andrepatriation of destitute Chinese had been proceeding regularly  during the lasttwo years.  Finally, the type of cultivation to which the Assyrians  are accustomedwould be very different from that obtaining in  Malaya.Palestine and Trans-Jordan.    In Palestine considerable difficulty was  being experienced in finding landon which to  settle the relatively smali number  of Arab  tenants who  had beendisplaced from the land  which they had been  cultivating  owing to it  havingpassed into Jewish hands.   Arab public opinion would inevitably regard theintroduction of any further foreign element into Palestine as a threat to their own position.  It would also probably lead to an outcry from the Jews. The position was much  the same in Trans-Jordan.  The Arabs of both countries had shownconsiderable  sympathy with  the  Iraq  Government in the controversy over the assyrian problem.    In June 1934,  following the rejection by the  Brazilian Government of thescheme  proposed by  the League of Nations  Committee, and   an  appeal  forassistance by the League of Nations to the principal  Members  of the League, sir philip Cunliffe-Lister caused further enquiries to  be made into the possibilitiesof absorbing the Assyrians in one or more of the following  countries british somali land, Uganda, Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland,  North Borneo and  Sarawak,.
Tanganyika Territory and British Guiana but was forced to the conclusion that,except in the case of the last-mentioned territory, the settlement of Assyrians was an  utterly impracticable proposition for the reasons given below.British Somaliland.    The country appeared to be physically quite unsuitable, consisting as it doesof  semi-arid grass plains with no permanent running  water and few wells.The Somalis, who are Mahometans, had to move their flocks and  herds over avery wide area during the year in order to find grass,  and there were frequenttribal conflicts.  Not only would the Assyrians be unable to support themselves,but they  would almost  certainly  run the risk of being  attacked by hostiletribesmen.Uganda.    The Governor of Uganda reported that the portions of the Protectorate whichwould  be  suitable for the  settlement of a people  such as the Assyrians were limited to  certain highland districts,  all of which  were too thickly populatedby natives for  the  settlement of any substantial number of  people.  The onlytracts of unpopulated country were areas such as those on  the east bank  of theNile below Lake Albert, which were infected by sleeping sickness and would be quite unsuitable.Northern Rhodesia.    The Governor stated that an influx of Assyrian settlers would undoubtedlyarouse  the  keenest resentment amongst the British white settlers and residents,who were finding it extremely difficult to  make a living.   He saw no prospectof the Assyrians being able to make a livelihood in the country.Nyasaland.    The Acting Governor pointed out that successive Governors had consistentlyendeavoured  to reassure the  natives of  the Protectorate in regard to the fearwhich they felt of wholesale alienation of land without their knowledge or realconsent.   Any  importation of  aliens and  allocation  to them  permanently  ofconsiderable tracks  of land would be calamitous and no native  authority  wouldconsent.  If  the native authorities were overruled, the result  would be  inter-racial friction  leading to bloodshed.   The  Assyrians  would  also  need  medical and educational facilities, which the Government could not afford to meet.  Therewas also the probability that they would enter into  competition with the native population in skilled or semi-skilled occupations which would lead to a justifiableoutcry.No?*th Borneo and Sarawak.    The British  Agent for Borneo expressed the opinion that North Borneowas physiographically and climatically quite unsuited  for Assyrian settlement.Malaria would be a formidable danger.  With regard to Sarawak he  statedthat he  had  discussed  the   question  with  the  Rajah  and that   he felt bound to agree with the Raj ah&apos;s view that Sarawak, with  its endless problemsof native  unrest,  was  not a country  with which to experiment with anycolonisation scheme.Tanganyika.    The possibilities  of  this territory were discussed  at an  interdepartmentalmeeting held  on the 28th June, 1934, at which the Chief Secretary to the  Govern-ment of Tanganyika (Mr. D. J.  Jardine) was present.   Mr.  Jardine agreed thatthe  only areas  in the Territory which  could possibly be considered were thosein the south-west  (Iringa and  Mahenge).  There  was  a certain  amount  ofEuropean settlement in those areas, but owing to the lack of communications, &amp;o,the  majority of the settlers  had  only been able to eke out  a  very precariouslivelihood.  In  these  conditions, to settle a  large number  of Assyrians would inevitably lead  to a &quot; poor white &apos;&apos; problem on a considerable scale, which the Tanganyika Government had striven  for  years to  avoid.  He had considered whether it  would  be possible to settle the Assyrians in  the neighbourhood of theLupa  gold-fields in the Iringa Province, with the idea of their being able  to       [15164]                                                       D
add to their means of livelihood by growing and selling food-stuffs for the miningpersonnel.  But he felt that this activity should be regarded primarily as an outlet for the  natives and  settlers already resident in the province, and there was noreason to suppose that they would be unable to supply the needs of this market.Mr. Jardine&apos;s-views  were subsequently endorsed by  the Governor of Tanganyika,who added that  there would be the strongest and most vocal criticism of a plan which would be calculated  to ruin the chances  of European settlement in  theSouthern highlands.  Additional provision was  also required in  that area  for future native expansion.British  Guiana.    At  the interdepartmental meeting referred to  above, the then Governor ofBritish  Guiana  (Sir Edward Denham), who was  present,  intimated  that he was prepared to do  all  in his power  to  investigate  the possibility of  settling  the assyrians in the large and  practically unpopulated areas of Crown land whichwere available in the Colony. The investigation was actively pursued during thefollowing year, and eventually a mission of enquiry  was appointed by the Leagueof Nations  to report upon the suitability of the area  which had been selected theRupununi   district.    The  mission  (Brigadier-General  J.  C.  Browne  and dr. G.  R.   Giglioli), however,  reported that the  area definitely could not beregarded as capable of affording a solution of the problem, mainly because of thepaucity of reasonably fertile soil which could enable  a sound agricultural industryto be built up.  The  scheme  was accordingly abandoned.    During the latter, part of  1935 and  the  first part  of 1936 the AssyrianCommittee  of  the League of Nations  endeavoured to arrange for the permanent settlement  of  the  Iraq Assyrians in the Ghab  area  of  the French mandated territory of Syria.   This scheme, however, had to be abandoned by reason ofpolitical developments.    On the 7th August, 1936, an  interdepartmental  meeting was convened inthe Colonial Office to consider once more whether there were any possibilities of settling the Iraq Assyrians  in any of the Dominions or Colonies.  So far as theColonies were concerned, it was agreed that  the  only territories which couldconceivably be listed for further examination were  Southern Rhodesia (which isthe concern of the  Secretary of State  for Dominion  Affairs), Kenya (Tana Riverarea), Northern  Rhodesia (north-eastern area),  the  Falkland Islands, the hinter-land of  British Honduras and Cyprus.  It was agreed to examine whether therewere  areas of  land in  any of  these territories, hitherto undeveloped  andunalienated, which,  with the necessary expenditure on irrigation, &amp;c, could bemade available for Assyrian settlement, and which would not have to  be ruled out for climatic or economic reasons.  In this event, it was agreed that the necessaryexpenditure on irrigation, &amp;c,  would have to be  met from the funds which hadbeen made  available  by the Government of Iraq, His Majest\&apos;s Government andthe League of Nations.    The possibilities of the  last five mentioned territories or areas were carefully examined, and for  the reasons indicated below I felt bound to conclude that none of them afforded a solution of the problem.Kenya (Tana  River area).    This area was reported on by an expedition which surveyed it in 1934.  Theofficers concerned reported that irrigation would  not be practicable in the loweror middle reaches  of the river basin, but that  in the upper reaches  it might bepossible  to  irrigate  some 200,000  acres of  fertile land  at a cost  of roughly 2,000,000.  The present population of the area would not present any obstacle tothe settlement of Assyrians, but the  area  had already been earmarked  for  theultimate settlement  of natives  from the  reserves, which  were rapidly being-denuded by excessive over-stocking of cattle. It was doubtful whether the area,which was  practically  on the Equator and low-lying,  would be suitable  for  the assyrians,   who would,  moreover,  have  to  become  agriculturalists.    the outstanding objection, however, was that it would be nearly ten years before  thearea could be made available for settlement and cultivation.
Northern Rhodesia (North-E&apos;astern area).    This area, as well as the Kasempa Province in the North West of the territory,is very thinly  populated.   The communications are  inferior and very few non-native settlers  have attempted to establish themselves in this part of the country.An ecological survey of the territory was in progress, and it would be some time before this was completed.  Until the results of this survey were known,  it wasimpossible to state what areas, if any, might be available for non-native settlers.The whole of  the land in the  north-eastern area, as well as in the Kasempaprovince, was, however, regarded as native land, and even if areas suitable  forAssyrian settlement were ultimately found, the question of whether the deliberateintroduction of a substantial non-native element could, in fact, be regarded as ameasure  designed in the  interests of  the native  population  would have  to be carefully considered. It was  highly improbable that  the Assyrians would be ableto find any economic market  for agricultural products,  owing to the  scarcity of communications, the remoteness of the  area, and the fact that in many cases  thesupply of such products already exceeded demand.The Falkland Islands.    Virtually  the whole of the available Crown land has been taken up, and thereis no land for sale. A large proportion of the land is held by the Falkland IslandsCompany, which  during  recent years has been engaged in sheep farming on an extensive scale.  Very little land in the Islands is used for agriculture.  The soilis peaty,  and for this reason,  and because of the constant high winds and lack ofsun, no trees grow and the vegetation generally is sparse.  The climate is cold andrigorous.   The inhabitants  of  the  Islands are almost exclusively  of  UnitedKingdom descent.The hinterland of British Honduras.    The  only areas of the Colony which could possibly be considered were in theNorthern part of the Colony and in the Cayo district.  Most  of the land in theNorthern area is privately owned, and such as is owned by the Crown was recently reported  as being for the most part of little or no value.  The wells are patchy andshallow, and the percentage of good agricultural land is not high.  Settlement ofany large numbers of persons would appear to be quite impracticable.   In  thedistrict of Cayo the country is broken,  and the amount of land suitable  foragricultural development is limited, most of it being privately owned or leased bythe Government.  Furthermore, there has been and still is considerable unemploy-ment in  the capital, Belize, which the  Government has been endeavouring to remedy by small-scale  land settlement schemes.   The market  for agricultural products in Belize is veiy limited.Cyprus.     Opportunity was taken of the presence in England of the Governor of cyprus to discuss this matter  with him.   Sir Richmond Palmer was definitely of theopinion that it would be quite impossible  to arrange for the settlement of even asmall number of the Assyrians in Cyprus, since not only was there no suitable landimmediately available, but even if land could be improved by the discovery ofwater for irrigation, it would be required for the use of existing landowners.     Following the recent military coup in Iraq, the position of the Assyrians wasconsidered by  the Cabinet on the 4th November and the 2nd December, 1936, andit was agreed that the Secretary of State for Foreign  Affairs, the Secretary ofState for War and I should consider  the  possibility of utilising  the Assyrians,as they had been utilised before, for military purposes, with a view to releasingBritish troops in the Colonies.     The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at the same time urged upon methat further consideration should be given to the possibility  of settling  at  anyrate part of the Assyrians in Cyprus, and suggested that an independent mission of  enquiry should be sent to the island to examine  the physical possibilities ofAssyrian settlement in conjunction with the local authorities.     An  interdepartmental  meeting was  held  in  the  Colonial  Office on  the21st December to consider these questions, and recommended (i) that  I should beasked to approach the Governor of Cyprus on  the subject of an independent
mission of enquiry being sent; (ii) that I should be asked to approach the Resident,Aden, and request him to consider whether it might be possible to employ in the aden Protectorate all or part of the Assyrian Levies (about 560 all ranks) atpresent in Iraq, upon their disbandment under the terms of the Treaty concludedbetween Great Britain and Iraq, the men being accompanied by their wives and families.    I accepted these recommendations and telegraphed to the Governor of cyprus and the Resident at  Aden.  The replies which I  received from the  Governor of cyprus have convinced me that Assyrian settlement in the Island is impracticable,and that the proposal to send an independent mission of  enquiry should not be proceeded with.    With regard to Aden,  the reply which I have received to my telegram fromthe Resident at Aden shows clearly that he is of the opinion that  the proposalto utilise the Assyrian Levies in the Protectorate is impossible to accept.    I recently received a  letter from  Mr. Amery, suggesting that the Vipyadistrict of Northern Nyasaland, which is at present sparsely populated, might be suitable for Assyrian settlement.   I discussed this possibility with a  district commissioner from the Protectorate who knew the district well and he reportedthat locally it was regarded as thoroughly bad country.    I annex copies of the following documents :       I.  copy of a note prepared in the Colonial Office dealing with the economic          difficulties in  the way of the settlement of Assyrians in  Cyprus.

 COLONIAL OFFICE MEMORANDUM.Settlement of Assyrians in Cyprus.                      Economic Difficulties of Proposal.    1.  The proposal  for the settlement of  Assyrians in Cyprus has now beenfully  examined in the Colonial Office.  This examination has been undertakenfrom  a strictly technical and economic point of view, and no political considera-tions  have been taken  into account.  The problem which has been studied is a purely objective one, i.e., is it or is it not physically possible for Cyprus to absorba number of Assyrian  settlers 1    2.  It has been thought desirable to obtain  an opinion on this point fromMr. Beeby Thompson of A. Beeby Thompson and Partners, Consulting Engineers.Mr. Beeby Thompson,  whose wide experience as Irrigation Engineer in egypt and elsewhere is well known, is specially qualified to advise on the question ofland utilisation and development in  Cyprus.  He has  paid many visits to the island to report on irrigation schemes, and has recently returned from a mission to the Island on  behalf of the Air Ministry.  His conclusions on the problemare contained in a semi-official  letter  dated the 30th November, 1936, which maybe quoted in toto as follows :          &quot; Referring to our recent conversation when the question of  settling    Assyrians in  Cyprus was  raised.  I now confirm  the view then  expressed    that it would be exceedingly difficult,  if not quite impossible, to  find any    reasonable acreage of uncultivated ground suitable  for agricultural pursuits    likely to support settlers.         &quot; There  is practically no land unoccupied that can be cultivated, and    the only cheap land is that where, due to the vagaries of rainfall and absence    of water for irrigation, only precarious  winter crops of cereals can be grown.    All land that can  be irrigated by perennial rivers, springs or ground water    is securely held and the water jealously guarded, and it has generally a high    market value.         &quot; Certain areas in the  Limassol,  Larnaka, Morphou and Famagusta    areas now used for growing cereals and carobs might be rendered valuable    by developing subsoil water under or near them, but even in these regions it    would be difficult to locate a single block of 1,000 acres.         &quot; Elsewhere the Messaoria alone holds out prospects of transformation    by  irrigation, but  as no surface waters are available in the summer and    practically all available flood waters are used in  the winter months, the    prospects of settling emigrants are remote.         &apos;&apos; Unless  and until ground  water  is found in  the Central plain little    more can be  done  than at present by  growing rain crops of grain which    depend upon  the  uncertainties of  rainfall.   Even here,  all useful land is    planted and  farmed by Cypriot  peasants.&quot;    3.  The opinion of Mr. Stockdale, the Agricultural Adviser to the Secretaryof State, has also  been taken.  Mr. Stockdale has visited Cyprus  three times inrecent years and has close acquaintance with every aspect of the practical problem at issue.  Mr. Stockdale&apos;s views may be summarised as follows :          With the present methods  of  agriculture,  it can be  accepted that    cultivable lands in  Cyprus are  fully occupied by  the  existing population,    and it can also be accepted that the animal (mainly sheep and goats) popula-    tion is as great as  waste or  pasture lands will carry.  If the methods  of    agriculture could be so radically changed by means of irrigation, and a system    of  intensive agriculture evolved  to replace the present extensive system, a
    much larger population could find means for subsistence and for profitable    occupation.  It is not known, however, how far a system of irrigation can    be made general.  Irrigation will have to depend solely upon waters from    underground sources, and at present the  distribution and quality of water    underground in Cyprus has not been ascertained.        // irrigation waters were available and were properly distributed, an    intensive form of agriculture would have to be developed and the growing    of  cereals,  except in quantities required  for  subsistence,  could  not be    contemplated.   The crops which would have to be grown would be  oranges    or other citrus fruit, tobacco, potatoes and leguminous crops, such as lucerne    for conversion into animal products. Vines could hardly be included, as it    would be impossible to compete with the low-priced products of Greece, and    the prospects  for wine are  poor.  It seems very doubtful whether,  even if    land  were made  available  by  irrigation developments, the  Assyrians in    question could play  a part in such  a  system of  intensive  agricultural    production.   It appears from the evidence that they are a pastoral rather    than an agricultural people.    4.  Sir John Campbell, Financial Adviser to the Secretary of State, has alsobeen invited to give his advice regarding the area of land which would be requiredfor settlement.   It will be realised  that Sir  John Campbell has  an unrivalledexperience of this type of problem.  He was  from 1923  to  1927, and again in1929,  Vice-Chairman  of the Greek Refugee Settlement Commission, which was responsible for &quot;settling in Greece the Greek refugees from Asia Minor after theGreek-Turkish War.  He also examined,  for the Zionist Organisation, the Jewishland settlements  in Palestine.  The question which Sir John Campbell was askedto examine  was :  How much land and  money  would be required  to settle in cyprus, say, 500 families or about 2,000 to 2,500 persons ?  His advice  may besummarised  as follows :       (i) The areas of land required vary with the crops  and the quality of the          market. But  the usual  allowance, based on  experience in  Greece,          which probably affords  a good guide  for Cyprus, may  be taken as          being roughly               60  to  80 donums* in poor land, for cereal cultivation.              30  donums or so,  for cereal and some small mixed cultivation, in                   fairly productive regions.                4 to  12 donums, depending on the quality of the land, for vines.                3  to  7 donums, for good tobacco land.  This varies greatly with                   the  locality.   One  donum  might  be  enough  in  quite                   exceptional  areas.   In  poor quality  areas,  the area would                   have to run  much higher,  possibly to  20  donums or more.     (ii) The above areas are based on  actual, experience in Greece, where the          refugees were helped  with  various &quot; side  lines,&quot; e.g.,  silk-worms,          cottage industries, fishing where possible, pedigree seeds  and  animals          where feasible : weaving, &amp;c.    (iii) The  cost was in the  region of   250- 270 a  family.  This  covered          housing, keep  until&apos; harvest,  draught  animals, seed grain, essential          implements, &amp;c.   It also included  all overhead charges administra-          tion,  stud  farms,  surveys, artesian wells, &amp;c.   These  &quot;over  heads&quot;          were of course calculated on settlement over an  enormous area, and          affecting a population of about three-quarters of a million people.  For          relatively  small areas, such as are under consideration here, the &quot; over          heads&quot; would cost very  much more.   It is  not possible to  give an          estimate; but at a rough guess they might run as  high as 50 per cent.           of the actual &quot;settlement&quot; costs.  It does not include the cost of the           land, as this was given free in the case of the settlement of the refugees          in Greece.     (iv) A rough calculation, based upon the above data,  would suggest that           24 donums or,  say, six acres, would be a fair average of the  area          required to settle one ftxmily.   This would make about  3,000 acres           necessary  for 500 families.                        * A donum = approximately ^ acre.
ANNEX II.Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor of Cyprus.                     (Sent 4-50 P.M. 5th January, 1937.)    IMPORTANT.   NO.  2.  Confidential.    His Majesty&apos;s Government have been giving further anxious consideration to question of Iraq Assyrians which was discussed with you when you were homelast August.  Matter is one that is causing us serious concern and embarrassment.During last four years League of Nations has endeavoured without success to finda home elsewhere for  these people,  who number in all some 26,000 souls.  I amwell aware of political objections that would apply in Cyprus, as elsewhere, tointroduction  of any substantial body of alien immigrants.  But point has beenreached when His Majesty&apos;s Government feel compelled, if only to satisfy Leagueof Nations that  they  have exhausted all means of finding  solution of question,to examine  physical  possibilities of absorbing  at least a certain  number  ofAssyrian  families in territories where  such possibilities,  actual or potential,might  be held to exist.    With this object Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has asked me toagree to an independent acl hoc Mission of Enquiry being sent to Cyprus as soonas possible to investigate; in conjunction with local authorities, the physicalpossibilities of Cyprus for the purpose indicated.  Funds are available not onlyto cover expenses of Mission, but also to finance future settlement should that befound  practicable.  Latter would include expenditure on irrigation  works, &amp;c.designed to make  land suitable which is not at present available.  It has beensuggested that  proposed  Mission should include  Major Douglas Thomson,formerly in  the Sudan Government  Service, who has been  employed by  IraqGovernment  since  1932 as  expert adviser on  Assyrian settlement.     I  am anxious to  do all that  I can to meet wishes of Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, not only because of embarrassment vis-a-vis League  of Nations,but also because whole question is one in which Imperial interests and credit ofBritish Government are vitally concerned.  You will understand that by agreeing to investigation of physical possibilities you will not be precluding yourself from making representations on political or economic grounds in respect of any specificproposal to which investigations may give rise.  In the circumstances I earnestly-trust that you will see your way to agree to  proposed visit.  Please telegraph ifpossible not later than 11th January whether j^ou concur.    5.  The above views appear to indicate conclusively that there is at present no land available in Cyprus for settlement.  The only way in which it could bemade available in any quantity would be by extensive irrigation schemes which,even if successful, could not produce results on any considerable scale  for someyears.  The actual  position in Cyprus at  present is that the land, wherever a living could be got from it, has been settled  and cultivated from time immemorial.The system of land tenure and water rights is most complicated.  Under theOttoman Law which still runs in the Island there may be sometimes half a dozenowners of a single carob tree.  It would seem impossible to escape the conclusionthat the. practical   and  economic difficulties of settling  in  the Island  any considerable number of  settlers from outside are insuperable.

ANNEX III.                                     (1)Telegram, from the Governor of Cyprus to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.                          Dated 7th January,  1937.                   (Received 10-57 A.M.  7th January,  1937.)    IMPORTANT.  NO. 1.  Confidential.    Your telegram No. 2, Confidential.    I am not in a position to weigh the consideration of Imperial policy in favourof sending the proposed mission to Cyprus against objections to such a course, but,from the local point of view, objections appear to be so overwhelming that I  deemit my  duty to ask  that the matter  may  be reconsidered, having regard,  inparticular, to the possibility that lasting and irreparable harm may be done in cyprus in return for comparatively slender results.    The sending of mission, whatever the results of its investigations, will, in myopinion, breed inter-Imperial distrust and suspicion locally  towards us, and will immediately raise, in an  acute controversial form in  the minds of  all thinkingCypriots irrespective of race, the whole question of  their political and economic position and future under British rule.   Past charges against British policy of expediency,  indifference and uncertainty which  it is our purpose to refute,  will,with calculated assistance of outcries in Greek and other foreign press, inevitably be renewed and strengthened.  If, as a result of the mission&apos;s investigations, orof subsequent representations from me, the proposed settlement of Assyrians  wereto be abandoned or so seriously restricted as to cause no complaint,  such wouldreasonably be attributed to pressure of local opinion reinforced by Greek or  other foreign sympathies.  The stigma on Great Britain would remain, and confidence of the  people in the good faith of this Government would be shaken, for it certainly would be assumed that  this Government had been  consulted in the firstinstance and had acquiesced.    The excitement and political  speculation  which  is bound to  result  from sending of this mission will extend and accumulate over fairly lengthy period which  must elapse between its visit, the presentation of its report and the finaldecision thereon.   This will have an unsettling effect on the minds of Cypriotssuch as this Government  is studiously trying to avoid.  The essential for  good government in Cyprus at present is a period of political certainty and quiet.    The circumstances of Cyprus are not at present  such  that the  inhabitantscan be expected to take a very wide or detached view of our Imperial interests,and the credit of the British Government in its dealings towards  them is a subject on which, though ready to take much for granted, they are still disposed to askfor enlightenment.  I have, of  course,  not consulted my Executive and advisory councils on this  question, but I feel  sure  that if I were  to do so  they would strongly advise against the sending of this mission.    If, however, you (group omitted) to agree to the proposed mission, I request that. I  may immediately  be advised in  order  that I may put certain recom-mendations on the points of detail before you.  These recommendations are not relevant to the consideration of the question  on general grounds.   Their adoptionwould not lessen the force of my above-mentioned objections,  but would be of  somenssi stance to this Government.

In the light of general  situation here and reactions observable  subsequent to abolition of censorship of press  and first assembly to-day of the new AdvisoryCouncil, I hope that, should no new and prejudicial political factors emerge, thepresent Governmental machine in  this Colony with development of local bodies,as examined with you in  1935, may be continued with safety and without serious opposition locally for some years; but,  in view of the strength of  feeling onagrarian debt problem,  and dormant  grievances regarding  Turkish  tribute,suggestion of any kind of organised and financially supported immigration bynon-Cypriots under our  wing would cause serious deterioration  in our presentsatisfactory  relations  with the local population.   Furthermore, I am convincedthat however much we may be able to increase present water supplies  or discovernew sources,  these supplies in this Colony will even then not be more than ourown  reasonable  requirements,  especially  if the  latter include  provision  formilitary, naval or air  force bases.  Moreover, it is  hard  to point to any availablearea in which such Assyrians settlement will become economically independent.

I have received a letter  to-day from Crowfoot, late of Palestine GordonCollege, in which he mentions conversation with Marshimun, who told him thatAssyrians were looking to Cyprus. Crowfoot requests my views.  I do not proposeto reply, but similar reports also originate from other sources in the Near East.Before long Marshimun&apos;s desires will be known in Cyprus; and, as will be plainfrom my telegram under reference, this will ruin any chance of Cyprus becoming a contented British Colony if it is followed by a Commission, and if it cannot be stated officially that Marshimun&apos;s ideas  are not supported officially.[15164]E
     Letter from Mr. Amery to Mr. Ormsby Gore, dated December 11, 1936.My dear Billy,                        112, Eaton Square, December 11, 1936.    THE name of the Nyasaland Agricultural expert, who is home just now, isA. J. W. Hornby, and his address is 26, St. Andrew&apos;s Road, Bedford. I have not met him myself, but he has been talking to Captain Gracey, the Secretary  of the assyrian Relief Fund. I gather from notes Gracey has taken of his conversationwith Hornby that the Vipya district, most of which is  between 5,000 and 8,000feet in height, is nearly the size of Yorkshire, and could easily absorb the wholeof the Assyrians several times over.  The district is at present entirely unsettled.    As the Assyrians are well cbntent to live on subsistence farming rather thanexport, they are probably much  easier to settle than most other people.  At thesame time, they are well accustomed to tobacco growing, and have, in fact,  grownsome quite fine tobacco in their temporary home in the Khabur.    I do not think there need be any objection from the point of view of race,providing we put out a certain amount of propaganda to say that they are essentially white men, even if  their home is in North-Western Asia.    If you could make this solution work it would be a great thing. And don&apos;tforget  bis dat qui cito dat.  Their situation is really pretty desperate.                                                           Yours, &amp;c.                                                 (Initialled)      L. S. A.ANNEX V.    Letter from Mr.  Ormsby Gore to Mr. Amery, dated January 14, 1937.(Personal.)Dear Leo,                                Downing Street, January 14, 1937.    YOU wrote to me a month ago about the possibility of settling Assyrians ina highland area in Nyasaland, particularly in the Vipya  district.    I&apos;ve just had a  talk to a D.C.  from Nyasaland who has been ten  years in the service and knows that part of the territory well.  The plateau between  and 8 thousand feet up is only approachable up very steep scarps and has theappearance of open downland, treeless, because trees won&apos;t grow in the very hardcolloidal laterite which composes  it.  For at least four months of the year it isin perpetual  mist or cloud.  All attempts to grow grain crops there have failed,and the Agoni tribe who live all round  it won&apos;t even let their numerous  cattlegraze there on account of the highly ironized  character of  the soil, &amp;c.   In factthey regard it as thoroughly bad  country and the Agoni are among the  stoutestand most enterprising natives in  Central Africa.    But the economic problem of  all North Nyasaland is very difficult.   The costof haulage to Beira is inevitably high, and Nyasaland is already enormously  aided by us so as to keep the freights over the new Zambesi bridge down as  much aspossible. Lacey&apos;s recent report on Nyasaland labour brings out the great difficultyof anyone in North Nyasaland producing anything for sale, the consequent povertyof everyone,  and  the excessive migration of the  able-bodied to the mines in the rhodesias, and now even  the Witwatersrand.   I do  feel that  to  &quot; plant &quot;Assyrians in such a  country would be incurring a terrible responsibility, andcourting economic and social disaster.    Migration anywhere of anybody is  a desperately up-hill job  in the  world to-day.   The Assyrian trouble, of course, is (1) Mar Shimun (their disaster), and(2) the  extreme nationalism of the Arab world  to-day as  exemplified by the murder of Jaafar, the Alexandretta row, and the Mufti &apos;s  evidence before thePeel Commission in Jerusalem.   They are spoilt children  with a, vengeance.   *                                           Yours ever,                                       (Signed)       W. ORMSBY GORE.
 Cypher Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Resident                                  at Aden.                      (Sent 11 P.M. 21st January, 1937.)    IMPORTANT.    No.  14.  Secret.    His Majesty&apos;s  Government are giving anxious consideration to question of settling elsewhere the Assyrians in Iraq, who are a Christian minority and whoseposition has become increasingly  precarious  since  the relinquishment of theMandate, and following the very  serious disturbances which  occurred  in  1933.During last  four years. League  of  Nations has  endeavoured without successto find a home outside Iraq for these people, and  have  sought the assistance ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government,  on whom  a  special  responsibility rests by reasonof the services rendered by the Assyrians  both during and after the Great War.Under the terms of the Treaty of Alliance  concluded with Iraq in  1931, it  isnecessary to disband the remaining Assyrian  Levies in Iraq  (some 560 ranks),and the presence of a disbanded  body of trained soldiers in Iraq might well lead  to  a repetition of  1933 disturbances,  which would have  most serious repercussions.   His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore  desire  to  know  as soonas possible whether it would be possible  for the above  Levies,  upon  theirdisbandment, to be transferred to  the Aden Protectorate with their wives and families and utilised as part of the defence forces.  In this event it is estimatedthat the total number of persons of all ages who would settle in the Protectoratewould be in the  neighbourhood of 2,750.  The cost of transporting these people would be defrayed  from funds which are available for the purpose,  and wouldnot fall upon the Protectorate.  It is  also probable that these funds  could bedrawn upon to assist the initial process of settlement. While His Ma j esty&apos; s Govern-ment  fully realise the political objections to a project to associate in  a singledefence force men of different races and religions, and while  they have no wishto force  the scheme on the Protectorate  if  it  would meet with substantialopposition on the part of the indigenous population, they feel bound neverthelessin view of the Imperial interests involved and the gravity of the present situation to ask you to give it the most careful consideration.  In this connexion it shouldbe borne in mind that the political  situation in the Yemen is likely to deteriorateand may necessitate some  further  measures for protecting our  interests in the protectorate.  The Air  Officer Commanding  in  Aden will be  able  to furnishyou with full information about  the Assyrian Levies.  Please telegraph your views as soon as possible.ANNEX  VII.  Decypher of a Telegram from the Resident, Aden, to the Secretary of State                              for the Colonies.                         Dated 24th January, 1937.

Apart  from  the  Royal Air  Force, Aden  defence forces are limited to British  Artillery,  Aden Protectorate  levies and smallancillary units.  All of these are stationed in  Aden Settlement area and not inthe Protectorate,  and  defence scheme does  not envisage  their  use  in  the protectorate except possibly in immediate vicinity of Aden.   Protection of the protectorate land frontier rests with Air Force, and Air Ministry policy does not contemplate employment of ground force in the interior.   Assyrians, if utilisedas part of Defence Force, would therefore be  placed in Aden Settlement or  its immediate  neighbourhood, where  climatic conditions would be unsuitable for       [15164]                                                   &apos; E  2
them and there would be no occupation for agriculturalists.  Question of financewould  be also  insuperable  unless His Majesty&apos;s Government  are  prepared todefray cost of maintaining them as an addition to Aden garrison.   Alternativesof attempting to settle them in the highlands of the Protectorate or of askingChiefs to employ them are  not  practicable.  Air Officer  Commanding is of theopinion that their religion and characteristics would make it impossible for themto associate easily with Protectorate Arabs and  Lake strongly  shares this  view.Further, most  of the  Protectorate is so arid that  it barely  supports presentpopulation and there is no  opening for  foreign  colonists,  whose presence would undoubtedly  arouse strongest antagonism.  I therefore  greatly regret that Iconsider proposal is impossible to accept.
SECRET.A.I. (37) 4.CABINET.COMMITTEE ON  THE  ASSYRIANS IN IRAQ.           Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    AT the meeting of the Committee held  on the 27th January it was agreed,inter alia, that I should be requested to make further enquiries respecting thepossibilities of settling some  part of the Iraq Assyrians in Cyprus, Aden andNorthern Rhodesia.                                  CYPRUS.    2.   With regard to Cyprus,  I have nothing to add to previous statements.As I explained to the Committee at the meeting on the 27th January, I mustregard this  Colony and the Mandated Territory of Palestine as being the twoout of all the territories for which I am responsible  where it would be leastpracticable  to  contemplate any  settlement  of  Assyrians.   The considerationsadvanced  by the Governor of  Cyprus in the telegrams of which copies were included as Annex III to my memorandum of the 23rd January (paper A.I. (37) 2)convinced me that it would be a waste of time further  to explore that territory.and that Cyprus should be definitely ruled out of the list of countries suggested for investigation.                                  ADEN.    3.   To  my memorandum  of the 23rd January  was  annexed  copies  oftelegraphic correspondence with the Resident at Aden.  Sir Bernard Reilly, inhis telegram of the 24th January, had intimated that, in his opinion, it wouldbe impossible to consider the absorption of the disbanded Assyrian  Levies in the protectorate forces, and that there was no opening for foreign colonists of any kind.   I, however, undertook to request Sir Bernard  Reilly to investigate thematter more closely and, in order to assist  him in appreciating the position,  Isent him a copy of a note on the subject which had been prepared by the ForeignOffice last January (see Annex I).  Sir Bernard Reilly  informed me that he wasconsulting the Air Officer Commanding,  British forces in Aden, in the matter,and he has now sent me a reasoned despatch (Annex II) in which he states thathe is unable to modify the views expressed in his  telegram of the 24th January.I feel that the considerations  advanced by Sir Bernard must necessarily preclude the Colony of Aden from being regarded as  a possible area of settlement for theIraq Assyrians.                            NORTHERN RHODESIA.    4.  Following the suggestion made by me at the meeting of the Committeeon the 27th January, I arranged for the Governor of Northern Rhodesia to meetMajor Douglas Thomson to discuss the possibilities of  Northern &quot;Rhodesia as an area for settlement.  The meeting took place on the 27th February.   I have sincereceived from Sir Hubert Young a note setting out the reasons which he gave
to Major Thomson  for  considering the  territory  as unsuitable  for  Assyriansettlement, and  a copy  of  this note is  annexed  to  the  present  memorandum(see Annex  III).                         NYASALAND PROTECTORATE.    5.  In reply to my letter of the 14th  January (a copy of which was included as Annex V of my memorandum of the 23rd January), Mr. Amery stated  that he gathered that Captain Gracey had  derived a  more encouraging impression ofthe possibilities of this territory from his conversation with Captain Hornby, the nyasaland  Assistant  Director  of  Agriculture  and Agricultural  Chemist.I therefore caused a letter to be addressed  to the Acting Governor (Mr. K. L. Hall)requesting him to  furnish his views  whether not merely the Vipya district, but any part of  the Protectorate could provide areas which might be made availablefor Assyrian settlement  (see Annex  V).   In reply, Mr. Hall  furnished a note which makes it clear that it would be most unwise to endeavour to settle Assyrianimmigrants in the only two possibly suitable areas, namely, the Nyika and VipyaPlateaux, until  exhaustive  investigations had  been  made  as to whether  any settlement would be economically practicable.   A copy of Mr.  Hall&apos;s  note  is annexed to this memorandum (see  Annex VI).    6.  I have felt  it desirable to lay before  the Committee  the whole of the correspondence referred to above, which is reproduced  as follows :  .    Annex    I. Despatch to the Resident at Aden, dated the 18th February,                    1937, enclosing copy of a note prepared in the Foreign Office.    Annex   II.

Annex  VII. Letter to Mr. Amery,  dated the 12th March, 1937.    7.  After careful consideration of the information furnished by Sir BernardReilly, Sir Hubert Young and Mr. Hall, I am reluctantly forced to the conclusionthat at the present time the Colonial  Empire cannot be looked to as affording any possibility of solving this most difficult problem.

Despatch from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Resident at Aden.(Secret.),Sirj                                     Downing Street, February 18, 1937.   &apos; I  HAVE the  honour to  refer  to my  Secret  telegram No.  14  of the21st January, and your Secret telegram No. 9 of the 24th January, in connexionwith the suggestion  that the Assyrian levies in Iraq could be utilised as part ofthe defence forces of the Protectorate, and transferred there with their wives and families.  The views expressed in your telegram of the 24th  January will be carefully  considered by His Majesty&apos;s  Government, who  fully appreciate thepolitical and economic difficulties in the way of giving effect to the proposal.    2.  The Secretary  of State for Foreign Affairs has, however,  asked me to transmit to  you the  accompanying copy of a recent memorandum  on the subjectprepared  in the Foreign Office, in which are set out his reasons for consideringthat a greater measure of control may be required in the Protectorate in the nearfuture, owing to the  political  situation  in  the  Yemen  and  other possible developments.  The views  expressed  in this  memorandum  do not necessarilyrepresent the final conclusions of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the subject.  Inparticular, with reference to paragraph 2 of the memorandum, it should  not beassumed that His  Majesty&apos;s Government at present contemplate any measure of direct administrative control  in the Protectorate, or any  immediate  departure from  the  policy of gradually  extending our influence through  the  local Rulers.Nevertheless, I shall be obliged if you will give this memorandum  your carefulconsideration, and inform me by the next available mail whether you  are prepared in any way  to modify the views contained in your telegram.    3.  A Cabinet committee has been set up  to endeavour to find some place orplaces in the British Empire where some, at any rate, of  the Assyrians anxious toleave Iraq can be  utilised or settled, and it is essential  that full data  regardingboth the possibilities and difficulties should be available for  their consideration.                                                I have, &amp;c.                                                     W.  ORMSBY  GORE.    The Resident at Aden.    (Enclosure to Despatch to the Resident, Aden, dated February 18, 1937.)Note by the Foreign Office on the possible Employment of certain A ssyrian Levies                          in the A den Protectorate.    AT a meeting held  at  the  Colonial  Office on  the 21st December last toconsider the question of the resettlement of the Assyrians, it was  suggested that possibly use might be made of a certain number of the Assyrians particularly those still serving in the levies in connexion with the protection and policing ofthe Aden Protectorate.  Certain parts of the Aden Protectorate, particularly inthe neighbourhood of the Yemeni frontier, appear to be fairly fertile and still very thinly populated, and it is perhaps conceivable that, if a certain number ofAssyrian men could be employed in military forces,  land might be found in this area on which to settle their families.  The relevant passage of the conclusionsof the meeting of the 21st December runs as follows            &quot; With regard to the Aden Protectorate, the Foreign Office  represen-    tatives pointed out that,  although there appeared  to be no immediate need    for  increased military strength,  there  were nevertheless indications that a    greater measure of control might be required in the Protectorate in the near    future, owing to the political situation in the Yemen and  other possible    developments, and, as recorded above, it  was agreed to recommend to the    Secretary of State for  the Colonies that the  Resident, Aden, should be    approached in the matter.&quot;    2.  . The suggestion of the Foreign Office  representatives was based on  two considerations :  firstly,  that  it was now  generally recognised that it  would be inevitable that His Majesty&apos;s Government should gradually assume an increasing
measure of direct administrative control in the Aden Protectorate, if only in viewof oil and air developments;  and, secondly, that the political future in the Yemenseemed so  uncertain, and possibly dangerous, that it might be very desirable, if only  as a  precautionary measure,  for His  Majesty&apos;s  Government to  be  inpossession of considerably larger forces in the Protectorate than are at present available.     3.   As regards the first  point, it is clear that our responsibilities in the aden protectorate are likely steadily to increase with the increasing interest taken inthis area  by oil companies and probably  other  enterprises interested  in  the exploitation  of  new areas, and  with  the inevitable  development of  flying.Moreover,  it is beginning to be recognised that it is essential from the point ofview of Imperial strategy that we should not allow any foreign Power  to establishitself in the Aden Protectorate, and that the only way to keep others  out is toassume the necessary administrative responsibilities ourselves.  As the country isopened up these responsibilities are likely to increase.   We shall, for  example,probably be  obliged before very  long to  attempt some kind of  anti-slaverylegislation, since it is an obviously undesirable anomaly  that a British Protec-torate should be one of the few  surviving areas in  the world where slaverycontinues to exist as a legal  institution.     4.   Whatever form our  increased control takes, it is.clear that we shall needconsiderable police forces.   It is, of course, arguable that these forces could be adequately supplied by the local inhabitants.  This may be so, but it  will clearlytake a considerable time to train up a strong and loyal police force from among;the native Arabs of the Protectorate,  particularly when  the extreme sparsenessand backwardness of the population is taken into account.     5.   The Assyrians who  have long been in British service, who are trained inBritish military traditions,  and who are universally regarded by all  the british officers, who have commanded them and served with them, as exceptionally goodmaterial and as constituting particularly valuable, well disciplined and loyaltroops, might provide a loyal police force of great value.     6.   From the point of view of the situation on the Yemeni frontier, it mustbe  remembered  that the situation  in the Yemen is  becoming increasinglyprecarious.  There is every  reason to believe that the tension between the Zeidisof  the  highlands and the Shafais of  the lowlands is  becoming more and moreacute.  Several prominent Yemenis on both sides are believed to be in foreignpay,  and  the Seif-el-Islam Ahmed, the heir  apparent, appears  to be deeplyimplicated in these quarrels, and might even become  the  leader  of one partyagainst another.  Meanwhile, the  Imam is  becoming an old man, and  has morethan once  been reported to be in rapidly failing health.   If then the trouble doesnot break  out before his death,  it  seems unlikely to be possible to avert it whenhe finally dies which may be  at any moment.     7.   The Italians, although they have undertaken in the Rome Understanding-with us of 1927, not to establish themselves in the Yemen, are actively intriguingin that country with a view at least to peaceful penetration and very possibly to intervention in the event of a civil war.  In such an event it is possible that the tribes on the Aden side of the frontier might become involved, and even that someof the contending factions in the Yemen, if not the Italians themselves might be tempted .to come over  the  Protectorate frontier.  That frontier  is at present&apos; practically undefended, and we should depend on the despatch of bombing  air-:craft from Aden to carry out any operations against an invader.  As  the country is very mountainous this may not necessarily prove an ideal method of dealing&apos; with the situation, and it is  perhaps for consideration whether we might not very greatly strengthen our position and establish a strong deterrent influence against any attempt at encroachment, by having a reasonably  strong body of reliable troops readily available in this area.  The Assyrians, who are mountaineers  and would, therefore, probably adapt themselves rapidly to the mountain country of the Yemeni frontier, are good soldiers and might form  a very useful  force for this purpose.     8.  The  Foreign Office  do not know how thinly populated this country may be, but  it seems possible that there may be valleys which are  still unallotted to local tribes, and where some  form of cultivation or pasture would  be possible.
The distance from Aden or the railhead at Lahej does not appear to be great, andthe Assyrians themselves  could be used on any road-making work which mightbe necessary.    9.  It is not improbable that the first reaction of a Colonial  Governor to aproposal to introduce Assyrians  into the territory  for which he is responsiblemay be unfavourable. Naturally, no one wishes to complicate an already difficult task by the introduction of a new element which may perhaps produce a hostilelocal reaction and constitute a new problem for the  future.  But it is submitted that the question must be  looked at as a whole  from the point of view of BritishImperial interests in their widest sense.  From this point of view  it is a generalBritish Imperial interest to avert any further disasters in Northern Iraq, wherethe position of  the  Assyrians-largely as a result of their  service under HisMajesty&apos;s Government -is exceedingly precarious.  Any further trouble over the assyrians in Iraq would now almost certainly spread to the other minorities andto foreign interests generally, with the result that British oil supplies from theKirkuk   oil  field  might  be  seriously  endangered  with  very  unfortunateconsequences for the supply  of oil at Haifa for the British  navy. Moreover,serious trouble in Iraq would place the Royal Air Force squadrons in that countryin a very difficult and dangerous position, and might react most unfortunatelyon the safety of our air communications with India and the Far East.   It issuggested, therefore, that  this proposal for the employment of  a limited numberof the Assyrians in the Aden Protectorate, and  the settlement in the Protectorateof the families and dependants of the men so employed, should be considered assympathetically as possible, and in the light of the problem as a whole.    Eastern Department,  Foreign Office,Despatch from the Resident at Aden to  the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    I HAVE the honour to refer to your secret despatch dated the 18th February,1937, transmitting to me a copy of a Memorandum prepared in the Foreign Officeregarding the  suggestion that the Assyrian Levies in Iraq might be utilised aspart of the defence forces of the Aden  Protectorate and transferred  to the protectorate with their wives and families.    2.   As stated  in my secret despatch No. 101, dated the 3rd March, 1937, Ihave considered this question in its military, economic and political  aspects, andwith regard to the first of these  I have consulted the Air Officer CommandingBritish Forces in Aden, who has stated his views, with which I concur, in a letter,a copy of which  I attach.  The military  problem is primarily  one for theconsideration of the Air Ministry, which since  1928 has been responsible for thedefence of Aden and the Aden Protectorate, and the suggested need for additionalground forces  to meet a situation  such as that contemplated in the memorandum is a question that  should be dealt with on its merits from  the point of view ofdefence.   It will be seen that the Air Officer Commanding at Aden does hot share the view expressed in the Memorandum that the Protectorate frontier  is at presentpractically undefended, and  I am in  agreement with  him.  There  is,  in myopinion, no justification for the institution of  a defensive  force that would, inthe judgment of the authorities responsible for the protection of the frontier, benot only unnecessary,  but  likely  to prove  an embarrassment.   Air  CommodoreMcClaughry has  drawn attention in paragraph 5  of his letter to  the largeproportion of non-combatants that it is suggested should accompany  an Assyrianforce to Aden, and to the need  of giving them protection if they were settled inthe interior of the country.January 12, 1937.ANNEX  II.(No. 108.  Secret.)Sir,The Residency,    Aden, March 9, 1937.[15164]F
    3.  From the economic  standpoint I can see no  prospect of  an Assyriancolony, even of the comparatively small size suggested,  finding a means of livelihood-hood in the mountains of the Aden Protectorate.   I understand that these people are accustomed to a hilly, fertile country containing timber and pasture,  capableof fairly intensive cultivation and with an ample water supply from streams.Such  a land differs widely from the rugged hills of the Protectorate with theirrare patches of cultivable ground, their lack of trees and their scanty supply ofwater.  The  difficulty with  which the  present population live in their nativedistricts is displayed by their  eagerness to emigrate  in search  of work :  any opportunity to earn  even small wages draws them in large numbers  from their homes to Aden or to neighbouring foreign  Colonies,  and stringent restrictionshave been imposed to check their constant efforts to find an outlet as seamen and firemen  in spite  of the precarious nature of this employment in the shippingdepression.  Empty valleys with unused potentialities for cultivation or  pasturedo not exist.   The artificially built up  terraces  in steep and narrow gorges  thatare a  familiar feature in many parts of the Protectorate are an indication of the trouble that the inhabitants  have  in securing ground for their crops.  A policyof development including the sinking of wells and the construction of roads might eventually increase the agricultural possibilities of the Protectorate, but it wouldbe costly, and if it were adopted it should be devoted to the improvement of the lot of the indigenous population and not to introduction of alien competitors inthe struggle for existence in this difficult country.    4.  On political grounds there are,  in my opinion, the most serious objectionsto the suggested  experiment.   The established policy of  His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment  in the Aden Protectorate is to develop indirect  control through the localChiefs and to cultivate  friendly  relations with the tribes.   The Memorandumcontemplates  the substitution of direct administration  and coercion by an alienpolice force.   Such a radical departure from the principles  that have hithertogoverned our aims in this area should  not be undertaken without the strongestreasons  and  very careful  consideration  of  its consequences,  and  it should beadopted only if it is justified by the needs of the Protectorate, and not incidentallyto an attempt to solve a separate  problem, such  as the future of  the Assyrians.There can be no  doubt at all that the introduction of settlers alien in race andreligion would be violently resented by a people as tenacious of their independence and their faith as the Arabs of the Protectorate.  It would also have a mostdisturbing effect  on  the neighbouring people of the Yemen and on the mind oftheir  Ruler, whose friendship and confidence we have been at pains to obtain,and  who maintains in  theory his reversionary  right to  the  Protectorate.Assyrians are superior to the local Arabs as soldiers, and they have a much higher standard of education.  They would inevitably despise the backward tribesmenof the Protectorate, with whom their widely divergent characteristics would makeassimilation  impossible,  and they would remain a foreign and  a  disturbing-element,  whose unwelcome intrusion would certainly be regarded as the fore-runner of a policy of forcible colonisation that would destroy the popularity thatthe British Government now enjoys and the loyalty that it now commands in thispart  of Arabia.   If  His Majesty&apos;s Government  desire an increased degree ofcontrol  in the Aden  Protectorate it  should be  obtained  by seeking the  willing-collaboration of the people and by promoting their welfare while respecting theirtraditions, and so strengthening their confidence in our integrity  and their trustin our friendship.  On-such a foundation it should not be difficult to extend our influence, and to institute, if necessary, a measure of direct intervention for thepreservation of law and order.   I cannot agree with the assumption that it wouldtake a considerable time to train up a strong and loyal police force from amongthe native Arabs. The experience of British officers who have trained the aden protectorate  Levies  leads  them to an entirely opposite conclusion.   There is a wide  field in the Protectorate for the development of backward Arab tribes underthe friendly guidance of British leadership, and the pioneer work of the RoyalAir Force and the endeavours of the Aden Political staff are already producingresults that encourage perseverance in a  policy  that may have beneficial effects of more than local consequence in the  Arab world.  I earnestly hope that HisMajesty&apos;s Government will  not decide  on a step  that is likely to weaken, and perhaps to destroy, the foundations on which this structure is being built.
    5.  For the reasons that I have endeavoured to explain, I regret that I amunable to modify the views  contained in  my  secret telegram  No. 9  of  the24th January, 1937, regarding this proposal, which, in my judgment, is militarilyunnecessary,  economically unsound  and  politically  disastrous  to  the  aden protectorate,  and  dangerous  to  the  wider  relationships of  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment in Arabia.                                               I have. &amp;c.                                                     B. R. REILLY,    The Right Hon. W.  G. A. Ormsby Gore, M.P.,             Resident, &amp;c.        Secretary of State for the Colonies, London.  (Enclosure to the Despatch from the Resident, Aden, dated March 9, 1937.)       Proposals for Settlement of Assyrians in the Aden Protectorate.Aden/l/ll/Air.Sir,                                                         March 8, 1937.    I HAVE the honour to refer to your letter No. C/480 of the 31st January,1937, and to the attached Colonial Office letter forwarding a note by the ForeignOffice, in which  the latter express certain views regarding defence of  the aden protectorate, and to say I have given careful consideration to the situation whichmight arise, from a defence point of view, in the event of the death of the Imamof the Yemen, resulting in a general deterioration such as that  envisaged by theForeign Office.    2.   In the absence of a complete appreciation of the situation from a political as well as from a military point of view, no attempt will be made to estimate whatforces will be required to deal with the problem. It can at least be said, however,that if ground forces are to be employed in the hinterland  a considerable force will be required, and it must be highly mobile. The War Office estimate  of theforces which would have been required to eject the Imam from the Protectoratein 1927-28, gives some idea of the magnitude of the problem and of the cost.    3.   A force of the size of the Assyrian Levies, whom the Foreign Office now wish to see settled in the Protectorate of Aden, bears no relation to the problem,and while the political reactions of such settlement are outside my province I am confident that such an attempt to establish an alien race of different religion herecould only have serious consequences.    4.   The Assyrians in Iraq have proved  themselves to be quite unable to settledown with their Mohammedan  neighbours.   This is largely due to the fact thatthey have been encouraged to consider themselves superior as fighting men, andhave adopted an aggressive rather than a neighbourly Christian attitude.  It is hardly likely  that they will be  more  successful in getting on with the wild anduneducated  tribes in the hills of the Aden Protectorate.   Moreover,  the  aden protectorate is  a purely Arab country. Our efforts to  establish the Jews  inPalestine have already had an adverse effect upon our popularity with  the Arabshere.  Any attempt to adopt a similar policy in the Protectorate at this time would undoubtedly have disturbing possibilities.     5.  There is another point  not  mentioned  in the  Foreign  Office note.iVccording to the  telegram from the Colonial Office to the Resident,  dated  the22nd January, the total number of persons of all ages whom they wish to bring-in is 2,750.   Of these apparently only  560 are soldiers and the rest are their families.  If  the families are  to be settled  in the hills as proposed they wouldcertainly require an armed force to protect, them.     6.  In spite of the implications contained in the Foreign Office letter, to theeffect that if conditions here deteriorate  as  they  anticipate,  aircraft may  beunsuitable or unable to deal with such a situation, I am convinced that no other means is available for  dealing with the problem economically and effectively..The provision of  a ground force capable of dealing with such a problem, even with air co-operation, would be very costly and in my opinion quite unnecessary.     7.  Aircraft, during the time the  Royal Air Force have  exercised controlwithin the Protectorate, have proved themselves to be capable of dealing effectively with either internal disturbances or external threats, and I see no reason why theyshould be unable to do so in the future. The Foreign Office fears that aircraftmay not be able to operate efficiently in mountainous country  are not  supported       [15164]                    &apos;                                 F 2
by the experience of many years of air control, both in Aden and elsewhere.Should the situation deteriorate as anticipated by the Foreign Office, the problem from a defence point of view will differ only in degree from that now existing.All that will be required to deal with it would, perhaps, be air reinforcements from, an adjacent Command which  could  reach here by  air in a comparatively short time.     8.  The system of air control without occupation  owes much of its successto the fact  that it places responsibility on local chiefs, and encourages them  to exert their own authority for the maintenance of order.  It avoids the necessityfor stationing troops and/or armed police in outlying places, with all the attendantproblems of supply and security, and the opportunities afforded  for  ambush  orloot.  Any other policy is attended by grave risks and will certainly be most costlyin both life  and money.     9.  The attached Foreign Office letter contains the  suggestion that it may  bedesirable in the future to administer the  Protectorate of Aden, and I do not propose to express any opinion as to the  desirability  or necessity for this.   Itdoes not seem, however, that the employment of alien Assyrian Levies from Iraqwould simplify or assist in the adoption of such a policy. Even if this policy were adopted, I suggest it would be most effective and economical to continue to rely on aircraft as the main  force  at the  disposal of the Government  in  the last resort, possibly with increases both of the  Levies and of the Armed Police from local sources.     10.   Local chiefs are now well aware  of the power of the air arm, and it isimportant that they should be encouraged to realise that therein lies security.Most places in the Protectorate can be reached by air from our base of Khormaksar,but it may be necessary to establish advanced bases either to enable  us to reachmore distant places or to increase the intensity of our effort.  From a ground pointof view, therefore, I suggest that all we require is that such bases shall be affordedprotection by the armed forces of local chiefs,  possibly with the support of the levies.  Also that local rulers shall be encouraged to resist attack themselves with air support.     11.   In conclusion, therefore, I am confident  that  such  a threat  as that envisaged by the Foreign Office can be adequately met by air forces/who need notconfine their efforts to engaging invaders, but who can attack the centres whencethey come and where their controlling authority is established if the invasion isbeing organised on a big scale.   During the past ten years the Royal Air Forcehave proved beyond all doubt their ability to control a  country such as the aden protectorate, and if further proof is required of the ability of aircraft to  operate effectively in a mountainous country the recent Italian Campaign in Abyssiniais worthy of careful study.

Unsuitability of Northern Rhodesia for the Settlement of the Assyrians.    THERE  are three main  reasons  why  I  regard Northern Rhodesia  asunsuitable for the settlement of 10,000 immigrant Assyrians.    (a) Geographical and  Climatic. Northern Rhodesia is a tropical territory in which malaria is prevalent  and large  areas are  infested by  the tse-tse fly-There is no unoccupied part of it suitable for  a pastoral people with the possible exception of an area in North-Western Rhodesia 200 or 300 miles from the only
ANNEX  IV.              Letter to Mr. Ormsby Gore from Mr. A mery.                                          112 Eaton Square, S.W. 1,My dear Billy,                                            February 1, 1937.    YOUR letter about the Vipya district sounds very  discouraging.  YourD.C.&apos;s account would certainly explain why the area is not at present developed.On the other hand, it does sometimes happen that an area gets a bad name andthat closer examination may prove its possibilities.  Apparently the agriculturalexpert, Captain Hornby, who spoke to Captain Gracey seems to have thought wellof it,  and it might be worth while cross-examining him and finding out how farhe spoke from real knowledge.  I don&apos;t think that the difficulties of communica-tion or  labour  necessarily matter so much  if  the  Assyrians  are to be  a self-dependent community.  I dare say the project is impossible, but I hope youwon&apos;t turn it down finally without being absolutely satisfied that it is so.                                                          Yours ever, .                                                                 L. S.  A.railway line.  Even here there would not be room for so large an immigrantcommunity, and in any case the country differs so widely from the natural habitatof these people and is so far distant from  it that it is to me incredible that theywould settle happily there.    (b)  Economic. The total  number of non-natives in Northern Rhodesia is atpresent under 15,000, of whom the majority are officials, missionaries and personsconnected with or employed at the copper mines.  The small- settler community isalready sufficient to provide practically all  the farm produce required locally, and external markets  have not  yet been developed to  any appreciable extent.   Theinflux of 10,000 pastoral immigrants would merely injure the existing settlercommunity and aggravate the problem  of reconciling their legitimate  interestswith those of the native  Africans.  The same argument would apply if  there were any suggestion that the Assyrians should be employed on the copper mines, wherethe policy  of  the companies  concerned  is  to  encourage  African labour  andconsequently to reduce the number of  non-Africans employed.    (c)  Political.- Northern Rhodesia is not at present faced to any appreciable extent with the additional  complication of an Asiatic problem, and the settlersfeel strongly that the immigration of  Asiatics is to be deprecated.  They watchwith close  interest the  present figure of  Asiatic  immigration, which is in theneighbourhood of 100 or less per annum, and would fiercely resent any proposalfor the  admission of so large  a  number as 1,000,  to say nothing of 10,000.  Inthis attitude they would, in my opinion, be fully justified, for I feel that, whilethe admission of  a  small  number of  Asiatics as traders, hospital  orderlies,clerks, &amp;c, might be justifiable as a temporary measure, to fill the gap at presentcaused by the backwardness of  the local  African, the mass immigration of anAsiatic community, presumably as a permanent addition to the population, wouldbe a grave  political blunder.    2.   I explained these considerations fully to Major Thomson when he visited the Colonial Office some days ago, and understood him to say that he appreciatedtheir force and fully concurred in my view.  I have little doubt that it would be endorsed by the members of the Northern Rhodesia Legislative Council, who will shortly be in London, by Sir Alan Pirn and Mr. Milligan, who are to report uponEconomic possibilities in Northern Rhodesia in the  course of this year, and byeveryone who  has first-hand knowledge either of  Northern Rhodesia or of the assyrian people.

           Letter to Mr.  K. L. Hall, Acting Governor, Nyasaland.(Confidential.)Dear  Hall,                               Colonial Office, February 10, 1937.    YOU may remember  that in the summer of  1934 I wrote to you about theIraq Assyrians (my letter 30804/34 of the 4th August, 1934).  I explained thatthe Foreign Office were considerably disturbed about the  somewhat precariousposition of these people, who number about 26,000, and were anxious to do all intheir  power to assist the League of Nations in finding a home for them outsideIraq.   I enquired whether you thought that it would  be at all possible to devise a scheme for the settlement of, at any rate, a proportion of them in Nyasaland, inthe event of projects for their  removal to British Guiana or elsewhere provingabortive.                             -&apos;&quot;    In your reply (C.S.  4/34)  of  the 17th  September, 1934, you stated that aproposal which might involve the displacement of  the present inhabitants and thepermanent allocation to an alien community of considerable tracts of land couldonly be regarded as calamitous and might well lead to bloodshed, and this view was reiterated in your further letter  of the  11th October, 1934, in which youreplied to my  letter of  the 24th September, 1934,  asking for your opinion on thepossibility of settling the Assyrians on the estates of  the large landowners, suchas the British Central  Africa Company.    As you no doubt know, the scheme for the settlement of  the Assyrians inBritish Guiana was abandoned in  1935, and a later scheme for settling them in syria has broken down owing to recent political events.    Following the  failure of the last-mentioned scheme, we were once  moreapproached by the Foreign  Office last autumn  and asked to re-examine theColonial  Empire with  a view to ascertaining whether there were available anyunalienated areas which  were physically  suitable for Assyrian settlement or which could be rendered suitable by means of irrigation, &amp;c.  In this connexionI should mention that  there are now  funds  available  for defraying expenditureon irrigation,  &amp;c, for  this purpose, and that these funds could probably also bedrawn upon to meet the expense of the transport of the Assyrians from Iraq toanother territory and the initial cost of their settlement.    Nyasaland was not included in the territories listed for re-examination last autumn, but it has in  the meantime been  suggested that its possibilities should again be explored.  I enclose  for your information  a copy of a  recent letter addressed to Mr. Ormsby Gore by Mr. Amery, who is greatly interested in thefuture of the Assyrians, together with a copy of Mr. Ormsby Gore&apos;s reply, whichwas written after he  had seen Locker.  You will note  that Mr. Amery was apparently  informed by  Capain Gracey,  the  Secretary of the Assyrian ReliefFund, of a conversation which the latter had had with  A. J. Hornby, as theresult of which Gracey formed the conclusion that the Vipya  district might be capable of absorbing the Assyrians.    Mr.  Amery has now written to the  Secretary of State commenting  that,although the account of  the Vipya district given by Mr.  Ormsby Gore  is verydiscouraging,  it sometimes happens that an area gets  a bad name and that closerexamination may prove its  possibilities.  He suggests that  the area should befurther investigated, in view of the fact that Hornby appeared to have thoughtwell of it.    Mr. Ormsby Gore  would therefore like you to ascertain from Hornby exactly what  he said to Captain Gracey, and to state whether  you agree or disagree withHornby&apos;s  views.  Would  you accordingly let  me  have  a reply giving  this information by the next available  Air Mail ?   It would be advisable for you toconsider  not merely whether or not the Vipya district could provide a suitablehome, but whether there exist areas in any part of the Protectorate which  couldbe made available for Assyrian settlement.   If  you  reach the conclusion that-Assyrian  settlement in  any part  of Nyasaland is  wholly  impracticable for economic, political, racial or climatic reasons, it is important that you should give full particulars of the reasons which have caused you to form this opinion.  Itwould perhaps be best for them to be set out in a separate memorandum.                                                    Yours sincerely,    K. L. Hall, Esq.                                      J. A. CALDER.
     Note received from Mr. K.  L.  Hall, Acting  Governor of Nyasaland.    CAPTAIN HORNBY, Acting Director of Agriculture, was invited to make.a statement of his conversation with Captain  G-racey, Organising Secretary ofthe Assyrian Settlement Scheme in London.  Captain Hornby&apos;s statement is asfollows :     &quot;  When I met Captain Gracey in London, I discussed with him the highlandareas of  south central Africa from the point of view of climate, soil and crops.I lent him my bulletin on the climate of central Nyasaland and our rainfall maps.I mentioned the report  of  Mr.  E.  W.  Davy on the Vipya highlands as showingthe possibilities of such  mountain areas and I dealt with the population densitiesof the  Nyika and other  highland areas.    I  thought I had made it clear to  Captain Gracey that it was very unlikelythat any part of Nyasaland could absorb any number of Assyrians even if theywere a good type of white settler and small farmer which he tried to make out to me by photographs and  descriptions.    He assured me that all parts of south central Africa would be thoroughlyInvestigated as  regards their suitability for settling bodies of these Assyrianseven those highlands of Portuguese East Africa which  are  near the northernextension of the Nyasaland Railways and that a special investigator would be sent out with that purpose  in  view as was done in the case of Brazil  and british guiana.   Naturally  I  did not  deal  with the political aspects owing to myignorance of these people, of  the capital which  they might  bring  as  possiblesettlers  and  the  attitude with  which  native authorities  might  view  suchimmigration.&quot;     After consideration of this statement it  was agreed  that the letter fromMr. Ormsby Gore to Mr. Amery, a  copy of which was enclosed in the  ColonialOffice  letter under discussion,  set out the position very clearly, and  that before any decision as to feasibility of any  such scheme  could be considered from theeconomic point of view it would be necessary to  expend a considerable sum ofmoney over a  long period on exhaustive experiments with a view  to determining whether the only two suitable areas for examination in this Protectorate, namely,the Nyika  and Vipya  plateaux, are  capable of supporting a large populationof Assyrian immigrants.     On  political grounds  it would  be necessary to obtain the prior consent of the Native Authorities  concerned  who,  though they  may have  expressed willingness, according  to  Mr.  Lacey&apos;s report  on  Emigrant Labour,  to  welcome a few Europeans of the better type  as  settlers, agricultural educationists and potential employers of local labour, might be averse from accepting Assyrians whom they would regard with as much suspicion as a colony of Indians.  If the Native Authorities declined to agree to any  such suggestion the Secretary of State  as trustee would have to be  prepared  to override their objections under the Native  Trust Land Order in Council 1936.     Furthermore, there was some doubt as to the morality, from the racial aspect, of dumping a white race down in the middle of Central Africa without any regard to the ethnological consequences of the future.   Moreover, in the event of the areas proving unsuitable for any reason the last plight of the Assyrians would be worse than the first.ANNEX  VII.                Letter from Mr. Ormsby Gore to Mr. Amery.(Personal)                                     Downing Street, S.W. 1,Dear Leo,                                                  March 12, 1937.    IN my letter of the 9th February I told you that I was asking the ActingGovernor of Nyasaland for definite information whether the Vipya district could possibly be regarded as suitable for Assyrian  settlement.  In the letter  whichwas sent to him, he was informed that Captain Gracey had formed the impression
after a talk with Hornby, the Assistant Director of Agriculture, that this areaof the Protectorate might be  capable of  absorbing the  Assyrians;  and,  inaccordance with your suggestion, he was asked to ascertain from Hornby exactly what the latter had said to Gracey.  He was also sent a copy of your letter to meof the 11th December, and of my reply to your letter, dated the 14th January.     I now send you a memorandum  which has been received  from the ActingGovernor, after the matter had been considered by him in Executive Council withthe  Assistant Director of Agriculture.  The  only conclusion from  Hornby&apos;sstatement is, I am afraid, that Gracey obtained a much too optimistic impression of the possibilities of Nyasaland as a home for the Assyrians.                                              Yours ever,                                     : (Signed)      W. ORMSBY GORE.
