4 0 printed for the Cabinet.  April 1937.Copy No.  43CABINET.        PALESTINE.IMMIGRATION LABOUR SCHEDULE.           Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    IN Cabinet Paper 81 (37) of the 2nd March, 1937, I discussed the questionof the  issue  of a  Labour  Schedule  for  the  period the  1st  April to  the30th September, 1937, and expressed my agreement with the High Commissionersview that, on  the assumption that the Report of the Royal  Commission mightbe ready by the middle of April, the wisest and most equitable  course was to postpone the issue of the Schedule  until a decision could be  taken in  the lightof the Commission^ Report.  It was agreed in the  Cabinet that I should beauthorised to instruct the High Commissioner :    (1) that while  the preliminary work  for the  determination of a Labour          Schedule for the six  months April to September of this year should          proceed  in  the normal way, no  Schedule  should  be issued pending          the decision of His  Majesty&apos;s Government which  would be taken in          the light of the recommendations of the Royal Commission;   . (2) that immigration under categories other than &quot; C &quot;  (immigrants with          definite prospects  of employment entering under the Labour Schedule          and their dependants) should continue in the normal way.    It was also agreed  that I should arrange at an appropriate time for a question and answer  in Parliament.-    2.  I have now ascertained that the Report of the Royal  Commission cannot now be expected before the middle of May at the earliest, and I considered it advisable to ask the High  Commissioner to give the matter reconsideration.It was pointed out to him that even if it proved possible for immediate considera-tion to be given by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Report of the Commission,the earliest  date on which the  Labour Schedule could be issued would be sometime in June,  probably not until June was nearly over.  In the meantime therewas a  serious  danger that the intentions of the Government would be misunder-stood by the Jews, and  that the impression might  be created that contrary to whatthe Jews have hitherto understood, it is proposed to suspend, and not merely to postpone, the issue of the Labour Schedule, and that this would be represented(not unreasonably) as a change of policy.   I have already received strong repre-sentations on  the subject from  the Jewish  Agency, and the position  will be oneof considerable embarrassment so long as the Agency remains in doubt as tothe intentions of the Government.     3.  Sir Arthur Wauchope has now replied  that he appreciates that thesituation has been altered by  the postponement of the probable date of the receiptof the Report of the Royal Commission, and that the new situation demands acourse of action different from that which commended itself to him when he  wasin London early this year.   He thei-efore recommends that the usual six months&apos;       [15021]&apos;SECRET.CP. 113 (37).
2Schedule should be issued, though he adds that, in his opinion,  this will make avery bad  impression  on the Arab  leaders,  which may react unfavourably  on public order.    4.   I entirely concur with the High Commissioners revised  recommendation,and I consider that the risk of creating an unfavourable impression on Arabopinion must be faced, as it was faced in October last when it was decided thatthere should be no change in policy and no suspension of immigration for political reasons.   If the issue of the Schedule is now to be postponed pending decisions to be taken in the light of the recommendations of the Royal  Commission, thedelay will no doubt be hailed by the Arabs, and equally condemned by the Jews,not only in Palestine but in Germany,  Poland and elsewhere,  as an  indication that His Majesty&apos;s Government contemplate a new departure of principle fromthe policy announced in the House of Commons on the 5th November 1936.    5.   If this course of action is approved, the adverse effect  on Arab opinion should be minimised if no preliminary announcement of intentions is made andthe ordinary  routine  procedure is followed.   I understand that  the, usualinvestigations into the labour position have already been carried out by the jewish agency and  the Department of Migration, and that the Jewish  Agency  inPalestine is on the point of submitting  its application  for labour certificates, tothe High Commmissioner.   The High Commissioner has  informed me that,  inview of the unemployment  situation (Jewish and Arab), the Schedule is in anycase likely to be a very small one (he has given no estimate yet, but I doubt whetherit would exceed  1,000), and that he proposes to take into consideration (as he is entitled  to do under  the  terms of the  then  Prime  Minister&apos;s letter  of the13th February, 1931, to Dr. Weizmann) the effect on Arab unemployment of therecent intensification of- the policy of  exclusive  employment of Jewish labour  byJewish organisations.    6.   If this line of action is approved, I would propose to make no statement in the House of Commons, but merely to concur with the High Commissionersrecommendation, and to suggest that he should invite the Jewish Agency to submit their application for labour certificates, if they have not already  done so.  Therepresentatives of the Jewish Agency in London would be informed confidentiallythat in the changed circumstances the proposed postponement of  the AprilSchedule has been abandoned, and that  the High Commissioner will deal withan application from the Agency in Palestine in the usual way.                                               (Initialled)       W. O. G.Colonial Office, Downing Street,       April 21,  1937.*
