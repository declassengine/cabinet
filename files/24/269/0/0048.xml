Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.               I circulate herewith for the  information of     my colleagues a draft of  the  statement  that I propose to     make in the House&apos; of Commons  on Thursday next, May 27th,     if the Cabinet approve  the proposals for the assistance     for oats and barley outlined  in the memorandum-by the     Secretary of State for  Scotland (CP. 140 (37)).                                    W.S.M.istry of Agriculture  and Fisheries, 10, Whitehall Place,    S.W.T:..    25th May, 1937.
10 9000&apos;         HRAFT STATBIvxBMi; ON A GRI CULTURAL POLICY.        I am glad, of this opportunity to make a statement.        The Government have very carefully considered the.  position of agriculture from the points of view of the welfare  of agriculture itself, national defence, and the importance  of maintaining continuity in our agricultural policy.   The  Government have in the past initiated proposals for dealing  with particular agricultural products.    This side of the  Governmenfs policy will continue and I hope shortly to  announce proposals for the future of the milk and pig  industries.   There are, however, certain fundamental matters  with which I wish to deal in the following statement.        In regard to defence, I should like at the outset to stress  the following considerations.   The two objectives - of  producing the maximum quantity of food to meet our  requirements in time of war, on the one hand, and of the  efficient development of our agriculture in time of peace, on      -  the other - not only demand very different methods but, to a  material extent,  are opposed to each other.   In particular,  a drastic policy of food production for war purposes would  entail the ploughing up of an extensive area of our grassland  for the purpose of growing cereals and other crops for human  consumption.    In peace time, however, livestock husbandry,  which is the foundation of our agriculture, is naturally based  on a grassland system on account of the physical and climatic  : ;&apos; &apos;   &apos;&apos;  .&apos;  : &quot; &quot;    &apos; : &apos; -    :::-::V&apos; . &apos;    V.- V ^ &apos; :V Y&apos;;&apos;.-. :V\ -: . -:V i &apos; &apos; :::,x &apos;   &apos; :-: :   &apos;&apos;&apos; \ :R       ; : \: &quot; &apos;  advantages which  favour it.   The Government has had to  determine where,  between these two objectives, the path lies  which, on balance, it would be wise to follow.        In the opinion of the Government, to put agriculture  on a war-time footing with all the  regulations,  the  regimentation of  the farming community, and the  heavy  costs that it would unavoidably involve, would not  be  practicable at the present time;  nor in their opinion is the
situation such as to require the adoption of this course intime of peace.   The Government are equally satisfied thatconsiderations of national defence would not justify a policyin peace time of stimulating agricultural production to sucha pitch that the country would he faced with a highlyartificial situation which would, sooner or later, have to heliquidated if the emergency did not arise.   Such a policy would he costly to build up and costly to close down.Moreover, farmers themselves will have a vivid recollectionof the disorganisation and uncertainties which followed the repeal of the Corn Production Acts in 1921, and the Governmenthave no wish to put them in such a position again.          Having regard to these considerations,  theGovernment are satisfied that the best course in the generalnational interest is to continue their efforts to improve the general prosperity and efficiency of home agriculture, andin particular to promote an increase in the fertility and productivity of our soil.    The proposals are so designed that should an emergency arise we should be in a position immediately to take advantage of improved fertility but, should it notarise, we should be increasing the productivity of the land ofthis country by means which are consistent with,  and not opposedto, the normal development of our agriculture on economiclines in time of peace.          To achieve this object, the Government propose thatthe following measures should be taken:-Drainage.          It is proioosed to extend the system of exchequer grants for works of land drainage to be carried out bythe lesser Drainage Authorities concerned in England andWales and the Department of Agriculture for Scotland.  It ishoped that with the aid of these grants it will be possible,in any one year, without interfering with the labour requiredfor agriculture, to undertake essential works costing up to 450,000.
Liming.          One of the most serious deficiencies of the land of this  island arises from failure to maintain the oldpractice of applying lime to the land.   Due to the longdepression, farmers have been unable to bea.r the cost.The result has been felt not only in diminished fertility,but also in the lack of elements essential to healthy plant and  animal life.    The Government propose to assist farmers in raising the fertility of the land by increased use oflime.   They also consider it desirable to secure increasedapplication particularly to grasslands, of basic slag which,like  lime, is available from home sources and has -anenduring effect upon the soil.   They propose that for alimited period of years the cost to the farmer of lime andbasic slag should be reduced by approximately 50 per cent.and 25 per cent, respectively.   The object of theseproposals is not only to make good past exhaustion of soilfertility in many parts of (Great Britain , but to build up                           (Tinited Kingdomreserves of fertility,  valuable in peace time,  and immediately available to meet the heavy demands, upon it which might be made in time of war.Wheat.          It is intended to raise the limit of the&quot;anticipated supply&quot; under the Wheat Act,  1932,  from 6,000,000to .8,000,000 quarters and thereby to stimulate an increasein the wheat acreage.   In present circumstances this involves no cost but will give valuable additional insurance to wheatgrowers in the United Kingdom.Oats and Barley.          The Government will also introduce a scheme of insurance against low prices for those growers of oats and barley in the United Kingdom who do not receivedeficiency payments under the Wheat Act.   For the purposes                        3.
^5 /*4&amp;bdetermined, and if this acreage is not exceeded an acreagepayment equal to six times the difference between a standard price of 8/- per cwt. and the average market price will he paid to the grower in respect of each eligible acre of oats,en the basis that, on the average, about 6 cwt. per acre are sold off farms..   If the total acreage eligible for subsidyexceeds the national standard acreage, the rate of payment will be redused proportionately.   In the case of barleythere will also be a national standard acreage, and thesubsidy payment will be at the same rate per acre as that foreats.   It is estimated that the Exchequer liability in any year in respect of both oats and barley will not exceed 1,750,000.Grassland Improvement.      In a policy aimed at raising the fertility and productivity of our soil the improvement of our grasslandmust be an objective of fundamental importance.    This formsone of our greatest natural resources and it is in thenational interest that it should be more fully andprofitably utilised in time of peace and be a reservoir offertility for an emergency.     By the Livestock Industry bill at present before Parliament and the arrangements for regulating supplies of livestock and meat to this country the Government are seeking to promote the prosperity and efficiency of the livestock industry.   The Government hopethat the combined effect of this measure and those nowproposed for drainage and for the promotion of increased useof lime and basic slag will lead to a concerted effort tothis end.   The Government are also alive to the potentialities of dried grass &quot;as a possible addition to home^grown supplies of feeding stuffs.   They are accordinglyencouraging further experiments in grass drying.                          4.
        Eradication of Animal Diseasev                  The Government also propose to initiate a large-        scale campaign for the eradication of animal diseases in        Great Britain.   Our object is to improve the health of our        livestock and increase agricultural productivity by seeking        to eliminate what is perhaps the worst of all forms of        wastage and economic loss in agriculture.   In the first        Instance, efforts will mainly be directed to the        eradication of diseases among our cattle.   The scheme will        involvxe.  an additional charge on the Exchequer of about         600,000 per annum for the first four years.   It will,        however,  involve centralisation of public veterinary        services and as against this increase the expenditure by        Local Authorities will be reduced by about  170,, 000.        Parliamentary authority will be required for these        proposals;  the Government are anxious, however,  to lose no        time in developing the existjng schemes of control cf disease        and accordingly I am arranging at once to amend the Attested        Herds Scheme by providing additional assistance in England        and Wales as has already been done in Scotland to owners of        dairy stock who are desirous of eradicating tuberculosis        from their herds.   This revised scheme will become        operative on the 1st June next.                  The necessary legislation will be introduced to        give effect to the aforementioned measures at the earlie&quot;st        possible moment and Parliament will be invited to pass it        into law before the Summer Recess.                  In the opinion of the Government the proposals        which I have outlined by increasing the prodiictivity of our        agriculture, not only will enable it better to meet the        situation in the event of war,  but will be a substantial aid        towards raising efficiency,  lowering costs and establishing        the industry on a sounder economic foundation in time of peace.I-ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.   25th May, 1937.
