MlSmM Wm STRIKES.The past week has been full of rumours of lightningstrikes which are to be oalled about the 18th Deoember, partlywith a view of bringing the grievances of the men home to thepublio by dislocating the Christmas holidays, and partly, nodoubt, because it is thought that any arrangements made bythe Government for the supply, of food would be upset by theabsenoe, pf so many people on their holidays.    The railwaymen,the transport workers and the miners have all beenrepresented as likely to oome outbut on tho whole it doesnot appear at present at all probable that a serious trial ofstrength will opour before Christmas.m mm &apos; :;&quot;-&apos;:,&quot;&quot;rfeg $takers,.The organisers of the Polios strike are now consideringa new plan of &quot;oaapaign. &quot;  Biey are determined to break upevery meetlnlfexoept their own until their demand forreinstatement, is granted,    ttie plan is very like that ofx - the suffragettes, namely, to organise o serieB ofinterruptions and to have a band of men trained in the use oftheir fists to deal with stewards who try to ejeot them.They are to&quot; abandon outdoor demonstrations *; I!he labour Members of the Liverpool City Counoil arerecommending direct action on the part of the local Tradestfhions unless the dismissed policemen are reinstated.

v  consumption-, are apt to be superficial.It is not easy to.assign a oause for the unrest whiohis simmering among the railv/aymen.    Probably it is due tomisunderstanding in the progress of the negotiations onstandardisation.    Ihe &quot;Daily Herald51, which is usuallywell informed in regard to strikes, had a leader entitled&quot;Peace or War&quot; on Deo ember 3rd. In whioh it says :&quot;Does the Government understand how strong is&quot;the feeling among railwaymen on the continued delay&quot;in the settlement of their claim for standardisation?&quot;She tine is getting very short.w Before- the end of the week another opportunity&quot;must be given for the dispute to be settled.    If&quot;that opportunity arises and Is taken, there will be&quot;peace on the railways; if it is refused, there nay&quot;again be another upheaval.    The decision lies with&quot;the Qovexnnent.&quot;(Bie strike last October was called off on the&quot;understanding *- Implied if not expressed - that the&quot;new standards would have an advance on the old,&quot;and that there would be a levelling-up of wages,&quot;failure to make this good will be met, if resolutions&quot;go for anything, by ft renewal of war.&quot;The Government may hkve good reason for notpublishing the different stages of the negotiations;otherwise publication seems desirable, tor, in the eventOf a strike, there would then be no ground for a chargeof secrecy from other tin ions or from the general publicAt present the ifeilway leaders have it all their own way,The following report has been received from a wellinformed correspondent at Liverpool.&quot;Peeling is running very higfr regarding the:   employment of non-union men and on the claim for 16s.per day;    As far as dan be seen now a strike is almostunavoidable *    Opinions among the union leaders aredivided as to whether they should call a stoppage aboutthe middle of December to hold up Xmas traffic or waituntil/

In Liverpool the masterbuilders say that the &quot;subsidy Is too small and they prefto proceed with more profitable schemes. An official *the looal bricklayers1 union stated that one effeot of t, subsidy would be a demand for lnoreased wages - which hefaot already been put forward. He said also that if himen were offered a bonus to lay more brioks per day thejwould nolf accept it, as they are opposed to the bonussystem.    They are averse to the training scheme for oeiwej
were under 19 when they joined the Army, arguing that itwould be unfair for these newoomers to receive the samewages as men of five, or seven years&apos; apprenticeship.    It isoontended by offioials and members alike that these menwould &quot;undermine Trade Unionism&quot;.lly Newcastle correspondent reports a shortage ofskilled building labour, in his district.    Manyof thejoiners went into the shipyards during the, war and haveremained there.    Master bricklayers in this distrlot statethat the subsidy is insufficient? they can make greaterprofit from pri-vate undertakings and they have apparentlymade Borne agreement not to underout eaoh other.In Glasgow the working.classes contend ttyat the subsidywill meke for &quot;Jerry&quot; built houses and. the opinion isgeneral that materials are being held up by trusts.&quot; Miere has been a number of meetings as a result of thecessation of the dole, but in the majority of places by far  .the greatest outcry has been from aooieties and agitators.In London, for instanoe, the Trafalgar Square meeting on ..November 30th was attended only by about 350 people, scarcelyany of whom were unemployed; only  1.12.7. was thrown on theplinth, although one speaker said that the expenses wereover  3.:;      1!) &apos;&apos;Ify oorrespondent reports that in Sheffield, Bradford ,and Leeds there feave been large demonstrations and deputationsto the&apos; City Councilsj the extremist leaders , however, arecomplaining bitterly that the unemployed do not attendmeetings.   &apos;3he President of the Sheffield branbh of theAmalgamated Sooiety of Engineers suggests a mass demonstrationfrom all parts of the country to the House of Commons.In Liverpool the feelihg amongst the workers affeoted- is very bitter j they say that for months past it has beenevident that the upper classes have begrudged the money paidto/
to.the unemployed and have made the moat of every oaae offraud in order to influence the Government.She deputation of Manchester unemployed who passeda resolution to the effeot that they would not be responsifor what would happen if there were no food for theirfamilies . received a salutary lesson from the labour lordMayor, who announced his intention of maintaining order atall oosts.Glasgow Tom Council, which has&apos;a large majority ofextremists, has decided by a vote of 65 to 8 to approaohthe Government with a view to finding work for theunemployed;  at Nottingham, however, a similar resolutioncaused practically all tut Labour Councillors to leave thehall and there was consequently no quorum.At Newoastle an Unemployed Committee has been formedand here again looal leaders of the Amalgamated Sooiety ofEngineers are prominent.    3foe Newoastle Iftbour Party hasplaoed their machinery and offices unreservedly at thedisposal of the Committee and has sent the following letteito the National Executive of every Trade Union affiliatedto the Trade union Congress.&quot;In the oity of Newoastle-on-Tyne to-day there aremore than 7,000 workers unemployed, approximately 6,000men and 1,000 women.    -Bxe numbers have been weeklyincreasing at an alarming rate and with the withdrawal ofthe out-of-work donation thousands have been thrown on tothe verge of starvation.    Newoastle is typical of thewhole of Tyneside and the county generally.    Theseunemployed men and women are, drawn from all sections ofindustry. &quot;On November 3pth a meeting of some 1000 people atSandhill, Newcastle, passed a resolution,urging upon theTrade union Congress to oall an immediate general strike;West Bromwidh Brassworkers have also demanded drastio aotio-Baere/
Ihere is a move to appeal to the Trade Union CongressParliamentary Committee to convene a Special Congress to dealwith the whole question of unemployment and to passresolutions to the effect that there should be a fluctuatingworking week in order to absorb the unemployed, and thatpending this arrangement the dole should be renewed.She paramount idea in the mind of labour seems to be- that the abolition of the dole is a oapitalistio move tointroduce under-selling.C.(M)P^TI.V3. JOpiaTlBJ Mj THE TH^E UNlOp.The latest available figures give the total numberof Co-operative Societies as 1,478 and the annual tradeis estimated at  225,000,000.    During the first half of theourrent year deposits end withdrawals in the Co-operativeWholesale Soolety&apos;8 Banks amounted to  248,568 ,342, anincrease over the corresponding period of the previous yearof  79,515.385.    The share and loan capital amounts to 54,288,456; the reserve fund is almost  4,000,000.    TheCo-operative Union, which is responsible for propaganda hasbehind it a defence fund of  100,000.. On November 29th a joint conference of Co-operativeSooieties.and Trades Unions, passed a resolution to ereot alarge public building, containing suites of rooms for TradeUnions, meeting room, a restaurant, an hotel and a 00-pperative store.Working arrangements between the two organisations,      have, been reached in Cardiff and are to be extended to thewhole of the South Wales and Monmouthshire coalfields.It is reported that the South Wales Miners1 Federation hasdeoided to pay the local lodge receipts etc , into theCo-operative Banks; the Cardiff branches of the NationalTJhion of iiailwaymen are already UBihg these Banks for thepayment of their current aooountsand for their quarterlyreturns, but*their investments have not yet been transferred.The/
- 10 -The Co-operative Barks have not so far paid interest to the!ITrade Unions but arrangements are now being made to pay thisat the current rate.ITewoastle correspondent reports that many TradeUnion branohes are transferring their funds to the Co-r*operative Wholesale Sooiety&apos;s Bank.An offioial of the Co-operative Stores at Stoke-on-Trent told my correspondent that he believed matters weremoving towards a general agreement in that area.    It isinteresting to note that a few looal tradesmen, as well as thCo-operative Societies, are aooepting the weekly 10s.vouchers of the ironmoulders.It is reported that in ocnseqnenoe of a disagreementbetween the Soottish Cc-cpe*&amp;*lve Wholesale Sooiety andthe Soottish Labour Party the former has deoided tosever connection.with the latter.   &amp; important point,which emphasises the value which would accrue if fullpublicity were given to Co-cperativo and Trade union:plans, is that some extreme labour oo-operators fromEdinburgh proposed that the Society should subscribe  10towards the expenses of Labour candidates in the recentmunicipal elections; this proposal was aftercards rebootedby 800 to 400 votes at a mass meeting of shareholders.A correspondent in: Liverpool sends the following,report:&quot;The number of cooperative stores in this areais so.small that any attempt to supply strikers withfood through them wou.121 be hopeless. &quot;The union leadersview is, !If every food shop was Co-operative it wouldbe O.K., but to try to supply our orowoVwith foodthrough the couple of do^eii here would just mean thatabout one hour!s lot would got frations1 and thenext hour*s orowd would have the shop and everythingin it, this idea will do in one or two small districtsin Yorkshire where everybody is Co-operative, buttill the Co-operative inorease their branohes by tentimes, for praotioal purposes itfs dud, *  Asked whetherthere was any idea of turning their funds over toCo-operative banks, the general reply was in thenegative.-As/&apos;
&quot;As Cooperatives buy the greater part of suppliesthrough brokers it is impossible to Judge the extentof their stocks, as they would store in brokers1names if it was required to hide anything.   Theirpurchases on the floor in Liverpool by theirreoognised brokers and agents have, during the lastthree months., been rather below normal; this appliesto Lancashire more or less generally.   It is, however,interesting that two of tiie largest firms who buyfor the Co-operatives all over the oountry, at theAssociation^ rooms here, have refused to workexcept on a deposit acoount or 1 limit,1 whioh njeansthat in tile event of any backing of strikefsthey would probably find the floor against them andtheir releases from store held up.   Prom remarksmade by Co-operative managers they appear to realizethis and are not so keen as is made out to honourstriking unions&apos; checks in this area.&quot;Biii^Ow^IlT-PUlWESSIt is possible that the situation in Barrow maybeoome oritioal owing to unemployment caused by themoulders&apos; strike and the reduotion of work at the yards.I am informed that a great deal of labour andSocialist propaganda is being carried on during mealhours by extremists who have taken employment in the yardsat Barrow for that purpose.0-IA3QOW &quot;HANDS OFF HJ3SIA&quot; DEMONSTRATION3Sxe extremists of Glasgow mustered to toe extent ofsome 5,000on November 30th, in support of their fellowBolsheviks in Russia.   A large booty of Sinn Felners andhundreds of Russian Jews were amongst the audienoe.   Theobject of the.meeting was to give publio impetus to themovement for a 24 hours strike on the Clyde early in1920, in sympathy with Soviet Bussla.   Jhe speakers wereCouncillor Dollan, John MacLean, George lansbury andLieutenant Colonel Malone M.B.,, who is apparently soenamoured of Bolshevism that he is not ashamed as anex-officer and a Member of parliament to share a platformwith a deolared revolutionary.   John M&amp;oLean, who hasreoently been predicting a war with America,said thatAmerica was getting ready for war and Britain was givingher/
- 12 -her the excuse.   Pussyfoot Johnson&apos;s eye would be toAmerica what Jenkins1 ear was to Britain 200 years ago,The attack on Johnson was organised by the British ParOffice.   It is an excuse in order that war may be etarteover tiie Siberian question,  Amerioa wants to get intoSiberia, so does Britoin.It is unlikely that MaoLean1 a, ravings would influenany ordinary Labour audlenoe,Mr.        Price who, it appears, is trustee for Mr.Philips Price, is now negotiating for the payment of4610,000 out of Mr, Philips Prioe!s property to Mr.Lansbury.   -Biis follows an earlier gift of  5,000 fromthe same source.Though the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; onoe desoribed the customof Christmas boxes as &quot;degrading,&quot; Mr, taiobury is nowappealing to all Labour organisations for a &quot;BumperChristmas Box&quot; for the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; development fund.The elasticity of Mc. Lt!nebury&apos;s spirits appears to haveinfected his figures, for quite recently he informed hisreaders that  125,000 had already been subscribed, andhe now states that his appeals have already produoed &quot;incash and definite promises over  18,000; in promiseswhich are contingent on oertain eventualities,  20,000.&quot;Both sums fall far short of the estimated  400,000.The circulation of the paper in Glasgow Is reportedto be between 25,000 and 30,000 daily; In the Newcastlearea it has slightly increased, but one newsagent in anIndustrial quarter stated that he only sold about sixdaily.OQ*PAiMMBL-*aHIP AT FOtiT SUNLIGHTThe attitude of Trades Unions towards co-partnershiphas come to a head.   The employees at Port Sunlight havebeen/
- 13 -been mde oo-partners in the firm of Messrs. Lever Brothers,with the result that everyone receives an annual percentageworth from 20s. Od. to 30s. Od. a week.   The AmalgamatedSooiety of Carpenters, CabinetHooakers and Joiners haveforbidden any of their members to become oo-partners, andhave expelled those who have accepted the scheme on theground that it is unfair to reoeive more than the standardrate of wages.  Lord LeverhuLae has interviewed a deputation,of whom half were willing to aooept the soheme and half, whowere Trades Union officials, were against it.   Three men whohave been expelled from the Union for being oo-partners aremoving for an injunction in the High Court,   Hie case hasbeen adjourned till the first day of next sittings,A CUiilOUS MEETINGOn the 2nd December the following persons lunohed ina private room at Gatti^ ;iestaurant:HEN;*Z HEASE, a man of German&apos; extraction whohas a small outfitting business,COMMANDED KENWO-wTHY, M.P,,GEOJSGE LtfNSHUY,K4MSAY MCDONALD,HOHEitT DELL, (expelled from Prance),riOBEiiT WILLIAM3,Mr. GOLDx&amp;NG,and the secretary of the British So dial! st Party.   Heasehad arranged the lunoheon, the cost being 6s. 6d. a head.During luncheon Hease addressed George Lansbury as follows:&quot;George, there is one toast which we alwayspropose here - &quot;All power to the Soviet Governments1&quot;.Everyone drank the toast and Iansbury then said, .*&quot;Who are the Soviet Governments?&quot;   This led to a heatedargument, during which I/msbury expressed disapproval ofthe Soviet Government in ftissia.   itobert Williamsexpressed strong disapprove! of the working class generallyfor its apathy.  Hease then introduced Mr. Goldring, ayoung man of about twenty-seven, who announced a schemefor/
for starting new propaganda in England for Internationalismwith a monthly paper, like a similar organisation in Paris,for whioh he made the usual appeal for funds.   Hease also&quot; announoed his intention of running a business to be knownas the ;jnglc*-iaisslan co-operative society, which also wouldrequire a good deal of money.   He&apos;uaid that some of themwould have to go to itossia, and that they had alreadyapplied to the passport Office for passports, whioh theGovernment oould not very well refuse.   After luncheonHease introduced Commander Kenworthy to the Seoretary ofthe British Socialist Party, who, he said, oonsideredthemselves the representatives of the -rtussian sovietGovernment in England.sim mm in mourn;A very large Sinn Fein Uemonstration was held inManchester on November 30th.   In addition to the FreeTrade Hall the New v.jueen*s theatre had to be scoured anda meeting was also held in the open air close by.  About15,000 people assembled altogether,   The object of theDemonstration was to promote the foundation in Dublin ofthe James Connolly Memorial College.   3he Free Trade Hallwas decorated with Sinn Fein flags, an(3 two or- three menin the uniform of the Irish Volunteer Army were on theplatform.

l-he prinoipal event of the week was the publicationof Hie Majesty&apos;8 Proclamation dated 25th November,suppressing Sinn Fein and its kindred associations allover Ireland in addition to the four Counties previouslyproclaimed.   It is too early yet to say what effeot thiswill have on the movement and so far Sinn Fein has givenno indication of any new development nor have its leadersin the Provinces publicly expressed their opinions on thesubject.Another matter which aroused the indignation of SinnFein and provoked the oritioism of a certain seotion of thepress during the week was the Government order thatprisoners are no longer to be allowed to prooure temporarydischarge by hunger-striking, and that they will beresponsible if they pursue these tactics.
