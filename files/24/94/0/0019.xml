General.Nil.Part II.-Departmental.Military Service (Civil Liabilities).The Ministry of Labour was first made responsible for the Military Service (pivili ;Liabilities) Schemes in May of this year, when the administration of the twq^ehemes thenin force was transferred to the Ministry, together with the machinery for their administra-tion.   The original scheme of 1916 was intended to benefit officers and soldiers servingwith the Colours who, having entered the Forces at any date since the outbreak of war,(C 1929)  255 11/19 H &amp; 8 &quot;30
found themselves exposed by their military service to serious hardship in fulfilling certaincontractual obligations. With the cessation of hostilities it became manifest that in alarge number of cases the difficulties which had given rise to the earlier scheme were notlikely to cease with the period of military service. A parallel scheme was accordinglyinstituted for the benefit of demobilised officers and men.The obligations for which assistance might be obtained under the earlier schemewere rent, rates, taxes, instalments and interest on loans, including mortgages, and in-stalments for the purchase of houses, businesses, premises or furniture, together withinsurance premiums and school fees. Under the scheme of 1918. assistance may also begiven in respect of any of these obligations. It was especially necessary, however, forsome provision to be made for assistance in the resumption of business or trade, and theDepartment was therefore granted discretionary powers to give, either instead of or inaddition to assistance of the nature already described, lump sum grants towards thepurchase of stock, fittings or similar requisites. Assistance given in this form was madeavailable for workmen who, having served with the Forces, found themselves without thetools required for their trade. Under both schemes assistance is obtainable only in respectof obligations arising in the United Kingdom, and cannot be given in respect of ordinarydebts. The maximum amount of assistance which can be given in any one case is limitedto  104.  No assistance can be given as compensation for loss of business during service.The application of these schemes rests in the hands of the Civil Liabilities Depart-ment, operating through District Commissioners throughout the country. For thispurpose England is divided into four main districts, London, the Home and SouthernCounties, the Midland Counties, and the Northern Counties. Wales, Scotland and Irelandare organised as separate units. In the administration of the scheme as applying to thepurchase of tools, the local officers of the department have been assisted by the LocalEmployment Committees, to whom such applications have been referred for advice inview of the technical knowledge of various trades possessed by members of the Com-mittees.The importance of the assistance thus rendered both to men in the Forces and in theresettlement of men after demobilisation may be illustrated by a few statistical details ofthe work performed. Up to the 15th November, approximately 12,000 applications hadbeen brought before the department by the local commissioners in the case of officers,and some 427,000 applications Jrom men, a total in all of approximately 440,000. Thebulk of these applications had, of course, been made before the Ministry of Labour becameresponsible for the scheme. The grants payable to officers and men still with the Forces are,as a rule, payable quarterly in arrears. About 560 grants were still payable to officers on the15th November, and a little over 9,800 grants to men, or a total of some 10,400 grantsin all. But nearly 1,100 grants had been made to officers which had already expired, andsome 92,000 grants to men had also already expired. Grants still outstanding amountedin all on the 15th November to a little over  411,000.Grants made to demobilised officers or men have, for the most part, been made aslump sum payments, but a number of continuing grants, payable quarterly or at shorterintervals, have also been made. These grants are given as a rule for three months only,and in order to secure the continuance of the grant the applicant has then to show thatthe hardship which it was intended to.jelieve still continues. On the 15th November,approximately 52,500 applications, irrespective of those withdrawn before decision, hadbeen made for grants to enable the applicant to re-establish himself in business. Nearly23,000 applications had been made for the provision of tools, and about 25,500 applicationshad been made for the assistance of disabled men. The total number of applicationswas therefore approximately 101,000. Lump sum payments had been authorised inrespect of approximately 19,500 cases in connection with the re-establishment of busi-nesses, including a number of cases in which the original grant had been increased, or inwhich provisional decisions had been given which were subject to reconsideration andcancellation at a later date. Over 10,000 lump sum grants had been authorised for thepurchase of tools, and some 11,000 lump sum grants had been made to assist disabledmen. In all over 40,000 lump sum grants had been authorised, involving a total of a littleover  1,185,000. As regards continuing grants, the number of grants still payable onthe 15th November amounted to 3,610 in which the application was for business purposes.Forty continuing grants for the purchase of tools were still in application, and 28 similar, grants for the assistance of disabled men, The total of continuing grants running on the15th November amounted therefore to nearly 3,700, involving a sum of approximately 142,000. -
Part III.-Press Comments.(1) Labour and Socialist Press.Railway Control.The Government proposals with regard to railway conciliation machinery and theadmission of representatives of the men to a share in railway control* arouse much com-ment. The &quot; British Citizen &quot; gives unqualified approval to the whole scheme, but theother papers confess themselves considerably hampered in their judgment by the way inwhich the proposals were made public and by the difficulty of arriving at a satisfactoryinterpretation of their meaning. The proposed conciliation machinery is welcomed bythe &quot; New Statesman,&quot; the &quot; Nation,&quot; and &quot; Justice.&quot; It is emphatically condemnedby the &quot; Socialist,&quot; as being &quot; mere Whitleyism.&quot; The &quot; New Statesman &quot; thinks itsafe to assume that the joint-control proposals should be regarded as a temporary. im-provisation, and judges that Mr. Thomas welcomes them only as an interim arrangementwhich will facilitate nationalisation. Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; thoughhe regards these proposals as marking an epoch in the history of British Industry, refusesto commit himself to a definite opinion on them. He doubts whether the railwaymenwill be able to retain unimpaired their right to strike, does not think that the scheme willhave any real meaning unless the railways be nationalised, and warns the N.U.R. not toaccept a method for the management of the railways which the miners have definitelyrejected for the mines. &quot; Justice &quot; fears that the three representatives of the men onthe reconstructed Railway Executive will find themselves burdened with much responsi-bility but in possession of little power, and expresses the opinion that it is the betterpolicy for trade unions not to have anything to do with the management of industryunder capitalism. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; is more violent in language, but putsforward a substantially similar argument.Industrial Courts Act.The passing of this Bill through Parliament does not attract much attention. Mr.Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; and Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, in &quot; Forward,&quot;both regret the decision taken by the Paliamentary Labour Party, as advised by anad hoc Trade Union Conference, not to oppose the third reading of the Bill in the Houseof Commons. They both fear that the Industrial Courts may be used as the foundationof a system of compulsory arbitration and think that a guarantee of no reduction in wagesfor a period of eleven months under Part III of the Act does not justify the acceptanceof Parts I and II of the Act. &quot; The Call &quot; regards the arbitration machinery of the Actas objectionable even as it is because it tends to conceal &quot; the irreconcilable characterof the antagonism separating the classes.&quot;Out-of-Work Donation.The stoppage of the out-of-work donation, so far as so-called civilian workers areconcerned, attracts more attention. Mr. Philip Snowden and the &quot; Yorkshire FactoryTimes &quot; dealt with the matter before the debate in the House of Commons on the 19thinst. The &quot; Yorkshire Factory Times &quot; still hoped that the donation might be extended,and Mr. Snowden insists that it is the duty of the Government to provide maintenancefor the &quot; genuine unemployed &quot; or else to provide remunerative employment. TheWoolwich &quot; Pioneer,&quot; forgetting for the moment the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act,guesses that the donation has been suspended in order that wages might be more easilyreduced. The &quot; Leeds Weekly Citizen &quot; protests that this is not the way to economise.The &quot; New Statesman &quot; concentrates its attention rather upon the fact that no schemeof unemployment insurance has been prepared to take the place of the donation, though itbelieves it to be a yet greater error on the part of the Government that the Housing Schemehas not progressed sufficiently to absorb all the unemployed. Mr. A. A. Watts, in &quot; TheCall,&quot; outlines the programme of the B.S.P. on the matter. In this programme the moststartling demand is for an increase in unemployment donation, while a deeply-rootedeconomic fallacy appears in the demand that &quot; the hours of those in work should be soreduced as to absorb those out of Work.&quot; The &quot;Cotton Factory Times &quot; deplores theGovernment^ decision, but it gives further evidence of its dislike of the way in which thescheme was administered by reciting a catalogue of casesf in which the Umpire hadreversed the decisions of the Courts of Referees. Any new scheme, it is insisted, mustprovide for industry to bear the cost of unemployment insurance favourable referencebeing made to the Cotton Control Board scheme and for the distribution of the benefitsthrough trade union machinery. This apparent preference of the &quot;Cotton FactoryTimes &quot; for the organisation of unemployment insurance by industries may be connected* As outlined by Mr. Thomas at Bristol, 16th inst.      f Copied from the &quot; Woman Worker.&quot;(C1929) 3 0 2
with the attitude it adopts towards the current development in Lancashire of somethingin the nature of a spinning mill trust. It accepts as inevitable the process of recapitalisa-tion through which the industry is passing, but presses its opinion that any good obtainedought to be shared by the operatives on the ground that &quot;. when adversity comes they arethe first to feel the pinch in reduced rates, short time, or unemployment.&quot; This paper,however, looks forward to a long run of full-time working and prosperous trade for thecotton industry.Mines Nationalisation.Mr. Hodges&apos; recent statement with regard to the possible critical development ofthis question between now and next March is taken up in the &quot; British Citizen &quot; and byMr. W. Stewart in Forward.&quot; The &quot; British Citizen &quot; interprets Mr. Hodges&apos; remarkas a &quot; declaration of war &quot; and calls upon the Government to handle him firmly. Mr.Stewards article is an exhortation in general terms to the whole of organised Labour tosupport Mr. Hodges and the miners. That such an exhortation should be considerednecessary perhaps shows that Mr. Hodges&apos; statement should be considered as an item ofpropaganda rather than as a, considered political prophecy. It is interesting to note thatMr. Stewart is somewhat perturbed by the railwaymen&apos;s anticipated acceptance of thejoint-control proposals ; he retains, however, sufficient confidence in them to feel able towarn the Government that any N.U.R. compromise on railway matters will not modifytheir attitude on mines nationalisation.Russia.The Prime Ministers statement of the Government^ policy towards the RussianSoviet Republic in the House of Commons is the occasion of much less excitement than theGuildhall speech.f The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; reiterates its advice to the Labour movementnot to be content with any &quot; merely negative policy towards Russia,&quot; but to insist upon apositive peace with the Moscow Government. Mr. Philip Snowden follows a similar lineof argument, but is much less sceptical than he was last week of the sincerity of the PrimeMinisters policy. Apart from the extracts (copied from the Continental Socialist Press)from Soviet speeches and decrees, which regularly appear in the more extreme papers,there are very few references this week to the subject. It would appear that the failureof Yudenitch&apos;s attempt on Petrograd, together with the Prime Ministers speeches, hasprevented an I.L.P. and B.S.P. campaign, of which hints appeared last week, to securea more important place for the Russian issue at the forthcoming special T.U.C., than itseems likely to receive. $(2) Ex-Service Men&apos;s Periodicals.Nil.Part IV. General Topics.The General Situation.The general situation has not altered in any material way during the past week.The period of conference and discussion continues, but very little progress has been madein any direction. The demand of labour for the control of industry, exemplified in themeantime by the negotiations taking place in connection with the management of therailways, the propaganda in favour of the nationalisation of the mines, and the campaignfor the public ownership and control of the liquor trade, is the most important featureof the situation.. Protests have been registered against the abolition of the out-of-workdonation to civilians, and it may be expected that labour may attempt to bring increasingpressure to bear upon the Government unless the comprehensive scheme of &quot;unemploymentinsurance on a contributory basis is speedily introduced in the House. The industrialsituation generally remains quiet, and, apart from the ironmoulders&apos; strike in whichattempts to arrange a conference have so far been unsuccessful, no stoppage of work on alarge scale is either in existence or threatened.Natioml Industrial Conference.The Conference called with a view to discovering some method of surmounting thedifficulties in connection with the exclusion of agriculture from the Government Forty-eight Hour Bill was held on the 24th inst. Sir Thomas Munro, Chairman of the. Pro-visional Joint Committee, accompanied by Sir Allan Smith, Chairman of the employers&apos;side, and Mr. A. Henderson, Chairman of the workpeople&apos;s side, met representatives of* Keported in the London Press, 15th inst.    f Cf- Report, 19th inst., p. 419.   X P- 423.
various organisations of employers and workers. No progress was made with regard tothe matter at issue owing to a difficulty with regard to the constitution of the employers&apos;side of the Conference, and it was decided to adjourn the proceedings until the 8th December.Until the question of the inclusion of agriculture in the Forty-Eight Hour Bill has beensettled, the arrangement for the establishment of a permanent National IndustrialCouncil cannot be carried through.The Nationalisation of the Mines.A special meeting of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congressand of the Executive of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain met.on the 19th instantand made further arrangements for the campaign in favour of the nationalisation of thecoal mining industry which is to be jointly conducted by the Trade Unions, the LabourParty and the Co-operative movement. It is stated that this new campaign will openwith a public meeting at the Central Hall on the 9th December, at which Mr. J. H. Thomaswill preside, and Messrs. Smillie, Hodges, Henderson and others will speak, and it isarranged that thereafter there shall be a campaign in the country by speakers representingthe Miners&apos; Federation and the Parliamentary Committee with the object of securing theapproval and active support of the majority of the people. On the conclusion of thiscampaign, a special Trade Union Congress will again be called to determine the actionto be taken. It is hoped that, as a result of this propaganda, the Government will eitherbe forced to nationalise the mines or to refer the question to the country in a generalelection.The Railway Negotiations.The negotiations between the railwaymen and the Government continue. Theexecutive of the N.U.R. met on the 26th to consider the new standard rates of pay andthe question of the future control and management of the railways. The progress of thenegotiations will be reported to the Triple Alliance at its meeting on Thursday. Duringthe week-end the railwaymen&apos;s leaders continued their campaign in the provinces. Mr.C. T. Cramp, speaking at Sheffield, said that he believed the experiments in joint controlnow to be tried would ultimately qualify workers to assume entire control. In con-nection with the wage negotiations, he stated that he was not sure whether it would notbe necessary before long to make an application for an increased war wage irrespectiveof the present negotiations. He strongly advocated the formation of one strong unionfor all railwaymen. Mr. W. W. Cooke, President of the A.S.L.E. and F., addressing ameeting at Crewe, maintained that the scheme for railway control did not rob the men ofthe right to strike, but would prevent &quot; lightning &quot; strikes.Control of the Liquor Trade.Steps are being taken to develop a labour campaign for the public ownership andcontrol of the liquor trade. A representative committee has been formed with Mr. J. H.Thomas as Chairman, and with Messrs. Clynes, Sitch and R. Young, with others,as members. This campaign, it will be remembered, was inaugurated at Carlisle on the8th instant (see Report, page 407).The Triple Alliance.It is interesting to note that a meeting of the Triple Alliance has been called for the26th instant. This meeting is probably due to the desire of the miners to ensure that therailwaymen on. this occasion will not do anything final without consulting them. Thereis evidence that the action of the railwaymen in striking without taking the miners intotheir confidence has seriously affected the amicable relations between the two great bodies,and a considerable amount of apprehension has, in recent weeks, been felt by the miners&apos;leaders in connection with the development of the negotiations between the railwaymenand the Government over the control of their industry. The miners point out that theyhave rejected a far-reaching scheme of joint control offered to them by the Governmenton the ground that control without nationalisation was not worth having, and they nowdisplay some annoyance that the railwaymen are apparently willing to accept the principleof control without nationalisation. The miners feel that it would suit the Governmentif they could prevail upon some other great organisation to regard with favour proposalswhich have been offered to the miners and have been declined by them as impracticableand unworkable. As long ago as the 26th October, Mr. Brace, writing in the &quot; WesternMail/&apos; expressed the hope that the N.U.R. would not carry negotiations with regard tojoint control to completion without taking their colleagues in the Triple Alliance into\
their confidence, and it is no doubt in view of the pressure that has been brought to bearupon the railwaymen by the miners, that the Triple Alliance has been summoned to receivea report on the progress of the negotiations.Labour Organisation.It is reported that a weekly meeting of those members of the Parliamentary Committeeof the Trade Union Congress who may be in London at the time will be held to considerany industrial matters which may have arisen during the week. In the event of any matterof great urgency occurring this more or less informal meeting will summon the fullParliamentary Committee to consider it. In this way, it is hoped that .the ParliamentaryCommittee will be in a position to act promptly on all matters affecting the position oforganised labour both at home and internationally. This decision is of much significancein view of the general movement, the main stages of which have been referred to week byweek in this Report, for the re-organisation of the central authority in the labour movement.Out-of- Work Donation.The decision to discontinue the out-of-work donation to civilians, has, in general,been received with calmness. It was generally recognised in the country that the donationcould not go on for ever. Labour has, however, registered several protests against theabolition of the donation. The Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congresshave instructed their Secretary to ascertain from the Prime Minister the attitude of theGovernment towards the unemployed, and are asking him to receive a deputation as soonas possible. The Prime Ministers reply, it is understood, will be discussed at the specialTrades Union Congress to be held on the 9th and 10th December. Various protests arereported from the provinces, especially from Manchester where the Trades and LabourCouncil, and also a mass meeting of unemployed protested against the abolition of thedonation, and demanded its extension until work was provided for all. The &quot; DailyHerald &quot; reports that approval is being expressed of the proposal originating on the Tynethat all the workers in the United Kingdom should stop work at an agreed signal for half-an-hour as a silent protest against the Governments treatment of the unemployed. Itseems possible that a campaign may be inaugurated in favour of the &quot; right to work ormaintenance.&quot;Income-tax.Although the general agitation in favour of raising the income-tax abatement levelto  250 is momentarily in abeyance, owing to the anticipation that the Royal Commissionon Income-tax will make recommendations towards a very considerable raising of theincome-tax abatement level, yet the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation is continuing itsactivities in this direction. In spite of the decision of the conference of the M.F.G.B.on the 22nd inst. and of the Council of the S.W.M.F. at a later date to suspend action inthe meantime, a delegate conference of the S.W.M.F. held on the 18th inst. decided byan almost unanimous vote to take a ballot on the question of continuing resistance to thepayment of income-tax on incomes of less than  250 per annum. The discussion at thisconference was very heated and at one stage a proposal was put forward that the executiveshould resign on the spot and be replaced by another elected forthwith by the meeting.The Council has issued a manifesto to the members advising them strongly to vote againsta strike. The Council points out that when the proposal came before the M.F.G.B. itwas not supported by a single representative of any other district, and that no attemptis being made by any of the organised workers elsewhere to resist payment by means ofa strike. The Council therefore considers that isolated sectional action by the minersof South Wales against a constitutional act of the Government, which has been acceptedby the M.F.G.B. and all other labour organisations, cannot hope to succeed and will simplydefeat itself. The result of this ballot will be awaited with interest. The South Walesminers have throughout been prominent in their disinclination to pay income-tax, andit will be interesting to see whether they will defy not only the M.F.G.B. but also theirown Federation.The &quot; Daily Herald.&quot;This paper announces that a provisional Committee has been appointed consistingof Messrs. Henderson, Hodges, Thomas, Turner, R. Williams, E. Bevin and W. C. Robinson,to issue immediately to the whole trade union movement a scheme by which labpurorganisations can render financial assistance in order to secure the development of the
paper. It is reported that the country has been divided into districts and each districtis being supplied with an organiser, to develop the influence of the paper.The Wood Green branch of the A.S.E. has called upon the executive to make a 6d.levy on behalf of the &quot; Daily Herald&apos;s &quot; development fund and the Hammersmith lodge of theGeneral Union of Carpenters has asked the executive to give permission for a Is. levy- onlodge members for the same purpose.Amalgamation.As a result of the ballot of the engineerng trade unions on the amalgamaton proposals,239,645 votes were cast in favour of the scheme and 42,665 against. Eight societiessucceeded in securing the number of votes required to give force to the decision. Thesewere the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, the United Machine Workers&apos; Association,the United Smiths and Strikers, the Steam Engine Makers&apos; Society, the Associated Brass-founders&apos;, Turners&apos;, Fitters&apos;, Finishers&apos; and Coppersmiths&apos; Society, the AmalgamatedInstrument Makers&apos; Society, the North of England Brass Turners, Fitters and Finishers,and the London United Metal Turners&apos;, Fitters&apos; and Finishers&apos; Society. Seven societiesfailed to secure the requisite number of votes.It is reported that the negotiations which have been proceeding between the NationalAmalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks, and the NationalAssociation of Grocers&apos; Assistants for amalgamation are nearly concluded. It is expectedthat the amalgamation will be complete by the end of the present year.Trade Union Topics.Northumberland Miners&apos; Association. By 44 votes to 10 the Council of this Associationhas decided to bring the following resolution before the M.F.G.B. : &quot; That a ballot of themembers of the Federation be taken in order to ascertain whether they are in favour ofgiving the executive power to call members out on strike without a ballot vote on anyquestion which the National Executive or Conference may decide requires immediateaction.&quot; A resolution was also passed requesting the M.F.G.B. to use its influence inextending the principle of the Triple Alliance by taking in unions with a membership ofat least 50,000. It was decided that in view of the continuous high cost of living, theCouncil urge the Miners&apos; Federation to have the war wage merged into the ordinary wages.A proposal asking the Miners&apos; Federation to take a ballot with a view to establishing a5-day working week was defeated.National Amalgamated Union of Colliery Enginemen. A conference has been held inBirmingham of the Midland branches of this union. The conference considered the reportsfrom the various counties on negotiations with coal owners, arising out of the first SankeyReport and decided to instruct their agent to write to the Coal Controller and inform himthat unless more satisfactory progress was made, a ballot would be taken of the men inthe whole of the counties concerned on the question of tendering notice. Reports werealso presented on the steps being taken to promote a better relationship with the Miners&apos;Federation in several counties ; general satisfaction was expressed that such negotiationswere in progress and the hope was entertained that before long a scheme for definiteaffiliation would be brought into operationSouth Wales and Monmoutlishire Colliery Officials&apos; Union At a meeting of the Mon-mouthshire branches of this union, the following resolution was unanimously passed : &quot; That this meeting recommends that a Conference be held of all colliery officials in SouthWales and Monmouthshire, with a view to amalgamation of forces.&quot;Railway Shopmen  A meeting of the local Railway Shop Committees connected withthe Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades&apos; Federation was held on the 20th inst. at Yorkand a national programme for the railway shops throughout the United Kingdom wasdrafted as follows : (1) That all craftsmen be called upon at once to join their respectivecraft unions. (2) District rate of wages to all grades. (3) Consolidation of all war bonuses,including the 12  per cent into standard district rates, (4) A 44-hour working week.(5) Abolition of systematic overtime. (6) Local arrangements to be made for overtime incases of emergency, breakdown, repairs of plant, &amp;c. Overtime rates to be not less thantime-and-a-half for time work and rate-and-a-half for piece-workers. (7) A week&apos;s holidaywith pay and payment for all recognised statutory holidays. (8) Abolition of the age limitin the medical examination and a share in the management and control of the railways.The most interesting of these points is the first. It represents the uncompromising craftattitude, which has recently been losing ground. Notable instances of its supersessionhave been seen in the rise to power of the N.U.R., an avowedly industrial union; the
recent negotiations for amalgamation in the engineering industry, and finally the appoint- -menttothe secretaryship of the A.S.E.-the stronghold of craft unionism of Mr. TomMann, an exponent of the &quot; one big union &quot; principle.&quot;Dockyard Discharges.In consequence of the rejection by ballot at Portsmouth of the proposed shorter workingweek, and the division of opinion on the subject at Devonport, the present policy ofdischarges continues to operate at the dockyards. At Chatham the men decided by alarge majority to adopt the system of short-time. The Engineering and ShipbuildingTrades&apos; Federation at its meeting on the 21st inst, decided to approach all the unions inthe industry and the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress with a viewto a joint deputation to the Prime Minister on the subject of dockyard discharges.Second International.It is reported that at the International Labour and Socialist Congress which meetsat Geneva next February, British Labour will be represented by a Joint Delegation fromthe Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, the National Executiveof the Labour Party and the Socialist Societies affiliated to the International as follows : The trade union delegates will be Messrs. J. H. Thomas, Will Thorne, H. Gosling, J. Ogden,G. H. Stuart Bunning, John Hill, A. A. Purcell, and. J. B. Williams. The Labour Partydelegates will be Messrs. Arthur Henderson, Ramsay Macdonald, W. H. Hutchinson,.Ben Spoor, Sidney Webb, C. T. Cramp, Ben Turner, Robert Williams and Mrs. Snowden.The Independent Labour Party delegates include Messrs. Philip Snowden, F. W. Jowett,R. Wallhead, Ben Riley, Arthur Ponsonby and C. P. Trevelyan ; and the Fabian Societyare also stated to be sending&apos; representatives.International Labour Conference Washington.The following principles have been agreed upon in the various committees to whichparticular subjects have been delegated, and they will be submitted to the Conferencethis week for final approval.(1) The adoption of the 8-hour day and the 48-hour week with the exceptions (a)where less than 8 hours are worked on some days of the week the hours not worked maybe re-distributed on other days, provided that no day exceeds 9 hours, and (6) that inindustries involving continuous processes, the limit shall not exceed 56 hours a week.All overtime is to be paid at a rate not less than time-and-a-quarter. The labour employedin the devastated regions of France and Belgium is to be considered as employed underspecial conditions. This agreement is not of course to lower any higher standardsestablished by law or collective agreement in particular countries.(2) The prohibition of work in industries between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. for all womenthrough the substitution of a modernised convention for that adopted at Berne in 1906.(3) The prohibition of the employment in industry of children under 14 years of age,except that Japan has agreed, and India has been asked to agree to raise the limit intheir respective countries from 9 to 12 with 14 as the eventual standard.(4) A special commission has dealt with the limitation of hours of work in Easternand other countries which involve special problems, which were fully represented in thecommission, and are recommending considerable reductions in the present hours of employ-ment with, definite maxima in each case.Questions affecting both, agricultural and maritime labour which were not includedin the present agenda have been raised by many delegates who were anxious for theirearly consideration. The Conference will take a vote as to Avhether questions relating toworking conditions in agriculture or at least to the length of the working day in agricultureshall be entered on the agenda for the next Conference, and the Conference will alsodecide whether a special session shall be convened at the earliest possible moment to con-sider the question of maritime labour, and more particularly the length of the workingday on board ship. The Conference has decided that the conditions of workers employedon inland waterways will also be considered at this conference.Perhaps the most important outgrowth of the Conference will be- the constitutionof an International Labour Office which is designed to be the permanent labour organisa-tion associated with the League of Nations. Its function will be to act as a clearing house,for, information on all international labour problems, to register laws and regulationsfor the various countries, and to prepare the agenda for the annual conference. Alreadymany problems have been referred to it by the Conference for examination. Considerabledifficulty has been experienced in selecting the governing body of this Office, but agreement
Part V.-Departmental and District Reports.&apos; (1) Departmental Reports.Appointments Department.Appointments. During the week ending the 14th November, 1,104 candidates wereavailable for appointments. The number of candidates known to have been placed duringthe week was 484, making a total to the 14th November of 16,633.Training Grants Scheme. The Grants Committee have received from the DistrictSelective Committees, 11,861 applications for training, of which 8,511 have so far beensanctioned.Employment Department.Out-of-Work Donation. The scheme sanctioned by the Treasury for the extensionof out-of-work donation to ex-members of the Forces during the present winter provides,in cases where the original policies have been exhausted or have expired, for a furthergrant of donation not exceeding nine weeks up to the 31st March, 1920. Donation willbe paid at the rate of 20s. for men, and 15s. for women. No supplementary donationwill be payable for dependants.

The principal case heard during the week wasthat connected with the engineering and foundry trades in respect of claims submitted(0 1929) 3 Pis expected this week. A resolution has been proposed by workers and employers alike,calling for the formation of a health section in the International Labour Office.The organisation of the Conference into three groups, viz., Government representa-tives, employers and workers, has had a salutary effect. Not only has it allowed theemployers and workers of different countries to unite on an identical programme withoutfear of unfair competition from States having lower standards than their own, but it hasalso ensured the knowledge of the support of each group for any decision finally reachedby the Conference. Thus the Conference^ recommendations will not only have beenthoroughly thrashed out by the various groups in each country called upon to endorsethem, but each nation will be free from the fear of prejudicing its interests by adoptinglegislation more liberal than that of its neighbours.
by various trade unions in the industry in pursuance of an agreement between therespective unions and the Engineering Employers&apos; Federation arrived at in February,1917, which provided that the unions should not be prevented from bringing forwardfor special consideration tlie case of any district in which they claimed that the rates ofwages were unduly low, or that the total amount of war advance was not adequate.Brassfounders.

period of apprenticeship has been interrupted by service in H.M. Forces would not benecessary, but that any apprentices eligible could apply under the General Scheme. Theyalso agreed that unindentured learners in the cigar section of the tobacco trade shouldreceive effective instruction for a period of four years, and that such learners should beregistered with the Trade Board.

A large number of &quot; undertakings &quot; in respect ofthe National Scheme have been received from local employers at Cambridge, and approxi-mately 8 per cent, of the total workpeople engaged are disabled ex-Service men. TheReading Employment Committee are pressing for the early displacement of women, em-ployed by various railway companies on light work, by disabled ex-Service men.

A further 119 &quot; undertakings &quot; are now under consideration.South-Western.Unemployment. The Live Register for the week ending the 14th November showsan increase of 715 men and a decrease of 511 women.West Midlands.Unemployment. The Live Register for the week ending the 7th November shows atotal decrease of 441 on the total for the previous week. The continuance of the iron-founders&apos; strike is having a serious effect on the West Midlands industries and large numbersare working short time. The end of the seasonal fruit trade is causing unemployment atHereford.(C 1929)3 P2
Employment of Ex-Service Men. It is reported that the ironfounders&apos; strike is impedingthe progress of the National Scheme, but that employers have promised to do their utmostto make the scheme a success on the completion of the strike. Hereford EmploymentCommittee draw attention to the number of unskilled men in employment at the HerefordNational Filling Factory whose places could be taken by disabled men.Juvenile Employment.-At a mass meeting of hairdressers held on the 6th Novemberat Birmingham, a number of employers undertook to adopt the provisions of the apprentice-ship scheme and model indenture of the Birmingham Education Committee. AnAdvisory Committee for juvenile employment under the Labour Exchange Act, 1909,has recently been established at Hereford.Small Holdings.-lt is reported that 600 acres of the Duke of Sutherland&apos;s TrenthamEstate have been acquired for small holdings for ex-Service men.National Laundry Workers&apos; Union. The members of the National Laundry Workers&apos;Union in the Midlands, numbering about 2,000, have decided to transfer to the NationalWarehouse and General Workers&apos; Union.Yorkshire and East Midlands.Unemployment.-The Live Register for the week ending the 7th November shows adecrease of 63 men and 952 women. The shortage of castings in consequence of the iron-founders&apos; strike is affecting factories where machinery is in need of repair.Northern.UnemploymenL-The Live Register for the week ending the 7th November shows adecrease of 536 men and 177 women.North-Western.Unemployment. The Live Register for the weeking ending the 7th November recordsa decrease of 1,018 men and 601 women. The shortage of housing accommodation atRossendale Valley, Haslingden and Bacup is preventing the transfer of skilled labourfrom other districts to meet local requirements.Wales.Unemployment. The Live Register for the week ending the 7th November shows adecrease of 550 men and 39 women.&apos; The strike of the South Wales Branch of theAmalgamated Society of Railway Vehicle Builders, Wheelwrights, Carpenters andMechanics is expected to affect the position at the collieries.Out-of-Work Donation. The Neath Employment Committee have passed a resolutionin favour of the continuance of out-of-work donation.Welsh Tinplate Trade. The result of the ballot of the workpeople in the Welsh tin-plate trade shows a reluctance to permit the substitution of an 8-hour for the 6-hour shift,with a view to increasing output and taking advantage of the opportunity created by thetemporary cessation of American competition through labour unrest. It is reported,however, that in all probability, the machinery of the Joint Industrial Council will be usedto deal with the question. There is still a shortage of mill men and the output is not likelyto be improved materially under present conditions until this labour deficiency is made good.There are indications that sections of the men intend to press various wage claims earlynext year, even though they may not receive the support of their accredited officials.The high prices which manufacturers are now receiving are regarded by the men as sufficientjustification.Sectional Pooling amongst Coal Trimmers. The system adopted a few months ago bythe coal trimmers of Cardiff, Penarth and Barry, under which the work at each port waspooled, and the total weekly earnings at each port equally divided among the trimmerswho were split up into regular gangs, has now been abandoned in favour of a system ofsectional pooling. The ports have been divided into sections and the men in each sectionwill pool and divide equally the total weekly earnings.Building Trade Wages. There have been one or two threats of trouble with regardto non-payment of recent advances granted to the building trade in South Wales.Building contractors in rural areas are alarmed at the possibility of uniform ratesthroughout the whole district. This is the undoubted policy of the workers&apos; side of theJoint Board, and a strong effort is to be made in favour of the adoption of a system ofgrading.  Local authorities are also concerned, for building trade rates to unskilled labour
is the determining factor in the wages of men in public services. A case in point is Car-marthen, where an agreed increase to building trade operatives at once inspired a demandfor a corresponding increase to roadmen, many of whom threatened to strike for additionswhich would amount to 70 per cent, on existing rates.Scotland,Unemployment. The Live Register for the week ending the 7th November shows adecrease of 433 men and of 363 women. Large numbers of female clerks are unemployedat Inverness. Weather conditions have interfered with employment in the building tradeat Perth, Inverness and Galashiels. Insufficient supply of electricity for industrialpurposes is responsible for suspensions at Alloa. There is no improvement in the unemploy-ment situation at Leith and Coatbridge. The shortage of castings in consequence of theironfounders&apos; strike is causing unemployment at Johnstone and Paisley. The non-delivery of hosiery machinery by the railway companies is seriously hampering industrialdevelopments at Falkirk.Shortage of Material. At Alexandria and Dumbarton a shortage of material for thecalico printing and dyeing industry is reported. There is a shortage of material in theshipbuilding yards at Alloa. The manufacture of locomotive boilers at Kilmarnock isretarded by lack of plates. There is no marked improvement in the supply of yarn forthe woollen and hosiery industries at Galashiels.Part VI. Disputes.(A) Involving a Stoppage of Work.Mining and Quarrying.Miners : Northumberland. The standing dispute over the working of &quot; baff &quot; Saturdays*caused the Ashington pits to be idle again on the 22nd inst. It is believed, however, that thelocal negotiations to settle the matter will succeed, and that the men will be prepared to resumeSaturday work, if the management agrees to waive the claim for damages which it has broughtagainst them.Miners : Neath. About 300 men employed at the Maesmarchog Colliery near Neath wereidle last week owing to a dispute over prices for &quot; dead-work.&quot;Quarrymen: South Wales. A provisional settlement of the strike of quarrymen at theBargoed and Britannia Collieries owned by the Powell Duffryn Company is reported. Thestrike which was the outcome of demands for increased wages begun on the 15th September.Mill Close Lead Mine: Barley Dale. In consequence of the protracted strike at thismine (see Report for the week ending the 1st October, p. 293), the mine has been sold.Metal Engineering and Shipbuilding.Ironfounders&apos; Strike. The statement that neogtiations were about to be re-opened betweenthe Employers&apos; Federation and the National Strike Council representing the Unions involvedproved to be incorrect. The Executive Council of the Unions on the&apos;13th inst. addressed aninvitation to the Employers to agree to a joint Conference at which the application of theIronfounders for 15s. a week increase should be discussed. The Engineering and NationalEmployers&apos; Federation have now replied that they cannot consider negotiations until the menon strike have first resumed work, and stating in effect that the point at issue is not the wagesquestion at all, but the breach of an agreement by those Trade Unions who are parties to thestrike. It is thus primd facie improbable that the strike, which is now in its eleventh week,can be speedily settled ; but the financial position of the Unions is stated to be getting serious ;and the prospects of settlement have been improved in another direction by the with-drawal of strike notices (which should have taken effect on the 26th inst.) by the AssociatedIronmoulders of Scotland.   (See Report for week ending the 19th November, p. 430.)Engineers: Messrs. Gillett, Stephen &amp; Co., Ltd. A strike of about 500 men employed by thiscompany at Bookham, Surrey, took place on the 24th inst. The men who were anxious toforce negotiations on a reduction in wages (which&apos; was ordered by the Company on the groundthat the men who are members of the A.S.E. are receiving more than the district rate of pay)alleged that the manager who had undertaken to meet them had left the works on holiday, andthus held up the settlement of the matter. The dispute was settled on the 26th inst., but nodetails are available yet.Wagon Repairers (South Wales). The strike of wagon repairers throughout South Wales which haslasted for seven weeks was settled on the 19th inst. The men had demanded an increase of50 per cent, on present rates, and have now agreed to accept 25 per cent.* i.e., Where wages are paid fortnightly, the Saturday of the week in which no wages are paid.
Textile Trades.Sailmakers (Liverpool).-A strike of about 220 sailmakers, members of the LiverpoolSailmakers&apos; Trade Society took place on the 17tli inst. The men demand an advance of 10s.per week in addition to the 5s. to which they are entitled under the recent award of theEngineering and Shipbuilding Trades.Furniture Trade Lpck-Out. The Furniture Trade Dispute at High Wycombe, where themen have been locked out for 17 weeks terminated on the 21st inst. The terms of settlementprovide for substantial advances, but the men&apos;s demand for a uniform flat rate has not beenconceded. The termination of the dispute at High Wycombe marks the end of the nationallock-out which was withdrawn in the other centres some weeks ago (see Eeport for week endingthe 22nd October).(B) Not Involving a Stoppage of WorkBuilding and Allied Trades.Building Trade Operatives: London. A dispute which threatened serious consequencesoccurred during the week over the failure to put into effect the terms of the recent wages awardof the National Conciliation Board. The London Master Builders were awaiting the ratificationof the terms by the Ministry of Labour,&apos; but under the Industrial Courts Act, the approval ofthe Ministry is no longer required in such cases. The Emergency Committee of the LondonMaster Builders called a meeting to consider the situation, and it was subsequently decidedthat the Association should give effect to the award forthwith. The rates awarded amountto an increase of 11s. per 44-hour week for labourers and 9s. 2d. per 44-hour week to skilledtradesmen.Painters: Yorkshire. Painters throughout Yorkshire are demanding increases of payall round to bring the hourly rate up to 2s. by the 1st May, 1920. The National Federation ofMaster Painters and Decorators hold the view that this constitutes a breach of agreement,since when the rates were last raised in July the men agreed to refrain from any further demandsfor a period of twelve months.  There is not at present any threat to strike over the matter.Mining and Quarrying.Miners: Staffs. A strike of miners is threatened at Kingsbury unless the trains whichtake them back from work are run more to time.- Colliery Surface Workers: Staffs. In order to press for an alteration in the basic ratesof wages and to obtain satisfaction on other matters arising out of Mr. Justice Sankey&apos;s Award,joint action is being taken by four associations, viz., the North Staffordshire Miners&apos; Federation,the Underground Firemen and Shotlighters&apos; Association, the National Amalgamated Union ofColliery Enginemen and Stokers and the Navvies and General Labourers&apos; Union. Theseorganisations have decided to put their case before the Coal Controller independently of theCoal Owners.  The situation with regard to the demands is considered somewhat serious.Colliery Surface Workers: South Wales. In connection with the trouble over certaindetails of the Sankey Award in the case of colliery enginemen and firemen, the Executive ofthe South Wales Colliery Enginemen&apos;s Association has decided to protest against the decisionof the Coal Controller that fan enginemen, air compressors and pumping enginemen shall notbe paid for the J-hour worked every day in excess of 7f hours.Miners: Rhymney Valley. It is reported that there is much dissatisfaction amongstthe workmen employed at the New Tredegar Colliery owned by the Powell Duffryn SteamCoal Company, Ltd., over the failure of negotiations for a price list. It is alleged that althoughsome men are receiving more, others are paid less than the district minimum rate. About1,400 men are affected, and it is considered possible that a strike may take place.Metal Engineering and Shipbuilding. .Engineers: Bristol Channel. The dispute with regard to the wages of members of theA.S.E. and the Steam Engine Makers&apos; Society employed in the Bristol Channel is expected toterminate shortly. The Bristol Channel Shipbuilding and Engineering Federation have upto now refused to make an offer unless the ban on overtime made by the men was removed.The men have now by a small majority agreed to withdraw this for one week, and it is hopedthat the employers will accordingly make an offer which will bring about a settlement.Gun Trade Operatives. It is reported that a strike of men employed in the BirminghamSporting Gun and Bevolver Trades is threatened over wages demands. A ballot is to be takenon strike action, the men belong to the Workers&apos; Union and the ballot is being organised by theassociation.
Textile Trades.Dyers, Bleachers and Finisliers : Lancashire, Cheshire and Derbyshire. The agreement inconnection with the demands of dyers, bleachers and finishers which Was expected to followquickly on the recent dispute, has now been signed. The parties to the agreement are theSociety of Master Calico Printers, the Employers&apos; Federation of Dyers and Finishers, theEmployers&apos; Federation of Bleachers, and the Employers&apos; Federation of Cotton Yarn Bleachers,Dyers and Sizers on the one hand, and the Amalgamated Society of Dyers, Bleachers, Finishersand Kindred Trades, the Operative Bleachers, Dyers and Finishers&apos; Association (BoltonAmalgamation), the National Society of Dyers, Finishers and Textile Workers, the No. 1 Societyof Makers-up, the No. 1 Calender Men&apos;s Society, and the Society of Female Workers on the otherhand. The terms of the agreement include an arrangement whereby the sliding scale relatingto the cost of living is altered, so that the wage shall rise and fall with the index figure, pointfor point down to 100. Should the index figure fall below 100 the wage shall move in a ratioof &quot;8426 for every point in the index figure. This agreement is thus similar to that reachedbetween the Bradford Dyers&apos; Association and the operatives&apos; unions, details of which were givenin last week&apos;s Report, p. 431. With reference to the application for payment for holidays theAllied Trades&apos; Committee consider that until a satisfactory scheme is adopted for dealing withunemployment, it would be inopportune to attempt to deal with the question of holidays.It was expected that the non-union question which has been agitating these workers for sometime would be dealt with in the agreement, but apparently this has not been the case.Lace Makers. The Nottingham Branch of the Workers&apos; Union have been negotiating withthe Nottingham Lace Dressers&apos; Federation, and have secured considerable increases in the ratesof dippers and stainers and of all women workers.Public and Public Utility Services.Corporation Workers : London. Employees of the City of London Corporation have askedthe Workers&apos; Union Executive for authority to take a strike ballot with reference to a demandfor 20 per cent, increase in wages and war bonus.R. S. HORNE.All mquiries relating to this report should be addressed to : Intelligence Division,Ministry of Labour,Montagu House,Whitehall,London, S.W. 1.
