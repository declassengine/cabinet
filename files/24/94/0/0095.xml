CHURCHILL.Uth December, 1919.The accompanying telegraphic correspondence arising from a speech made byColonel Rowlandson to the Caucasian Mountaineers, fully illustrates the difficultiesamid which British officers are at present working in their endeavours to deal withpolitical matters in territories of the former Russian Empire.In this particular instance Colonel Rowlandson was ordered to proceed toTemir-khan-Shura with the concurrence of the Foreign Office, and with the objectof securing peaceful relations between the Volunteer Army and the unruly inhabitantsof Daghestan. This officer, who has had considerable experience of the tribesmen withwhom he was dealing, apparently judged that the only way to impress his audiencewas to adopt a line of argument indicating -the evil results that would overtake thosewho continued to foment disorder in General Denikins rear.Violent exception was taken to this speech by the Governments of Azerbaijan andGeorgia, who protested to Mr. Wardrop, the British political representative at Tiflis,who in turn took up the cudgels energetically on their behalf.While admitting that upon reading the text of Colonel Rowlandson&apos;s speech incold print it would appear that certain parts could have been better expressed, it seemsdesirable to point out that it is necessary to consider the character of the audience forwhom it was intended.Colonel Rowlandson was addressing, not a body of polished diplomats, but therepresentatives of half-civilized tribesmen to whom a threat of force was the. onlyargument which carried any weight. At any rate, the speech seems to have hadthe desired effect, and it has drawn no protest from the tribes affected, unless aneffusion from the discredited Allied Medjliss is to be taken seriously.Colonel Rowlandson&apos;s reference to the Georgian and Azerbaijan nationals, whohave been intriguing in Bolshevik interest in Daghestan, appears, however, to havetouched the Governments of Georgia and Azerbaijan upon a tender spot. This isremarkable seeing that they disclaim any connection with these intriguers, who, theysay, are acting without their sanction and.contrary to their wishes.Putting aside the specific case referred to above, it is felt, in general, that it is notso much the British military representatives who are at fault, but the position inwhich they are placed by the absence of a settled and co-ordinated policy towardsthe territories and races of the former Russian Empire.The military representatives in these regions find themselves confronted almostdaily with situations requiring instant decisions, and it would be indeed marvellous ifthey invariably succeeded in interpreting in every detail the wishes of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and in avoiding a chance word capable of being magnified into a diplomaticincident.For these reasons it is feared that unless British policy in the Caucasus and SouthRussia is co-ordinated, incidents of a similar nature must inevitably occur in the future,whether the offenders be military officers or diplomatic representatives.(B19/574)  90  12/19  H&amp;8 7788wo

All latest reports state that Gi-o who was Commander-in-Chief of lied forces in Grozhyiodlast winter working hand in glove with Uzunghddji. .

Rowlandson whs (group undecipherable) appointed Oommandeivin-Chief of Ingush forces.He owes his escape to Ingushes and has thanked the tribal representatives in their own countrieswhere he has much influence.4. Rowlandson lately made speech to Ingushi, Daghestanis and Chechens which was printed-strid published, explaining the British Government Was giving whole-hearted support to Denikinand that any aggression on parts of Georgia of Azerbaijan Would deprive them of goodwill ofBritish. He said that it Would be &amp; pity if General Dehikin had to employ bourgeois we (!)depend on (one group undecipherable) against insurgents^ who he explained were dupes of theBolsheviks against whoni thousands of the Bolsheviks were fighting on northern front.Representatives of all tribes welcomed this statement.5.

(Alleged proclamation by Colonel Rowlandson.) Your telegram No. 100 of31st October. 1 am causing enquiry to be made as to alleged proclamation, but so far havereceived no confirmation of it. Its reported terms in ho way represent views of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, and yo may give emphatic assurance to this effect to Governments concerned.From Denmiss, Taganrog, to War Office   .(No. IP. 2718.) 9th November, 1919.7th. Your No. 28107* of 7th November. With consent of DenikinV Staff, RoAvlandsonwas sent to talk (?) to men, object being to let insurgent tribesmen know futility of fightingDenikin and true state (?) of affairs. Rumours were rite that British were ceasing to supportDenikin and that Turks had driven British out of Baku and (?) Tiflis. Latter arose fromwithdrawal of our (?) platoons (?) from Erzeium, from Petrovsk and from (two groups omitted)from Caspian. Representatives of tribesmen welcomed Rowlandson&apos;s speech. Full text ofspeech: &quot;British Government is (?) assisting Denikin to (?) attain his (?) objects, namely, torestore great indivisible Russia to (?) defeat Bolshevists and wide self government for mountainpeople. Because you must not think that England is against Denikin because she has withdrawnher troops from Baku aud Tiflis. England withdrew her troops having driven Germans&apos; andTurks out of Trans-Caucasia. British representative in Trans-Caucasus told Georgians andAzerbaijans on 4th August that Daghestan in Denikins sphere and that these two countriesshould assist Denkin in his fighting with Bolshevists otherwise (?) they would forfeit (?) goodwill of Allies. That there are Georgians and Azerbaijans assisting the (?) rising engineered byBolshevists in Daghestan and Chechnya there is no doubt. The British Mission is aware thatthis rising is not national but Bolshevik and caused (one group omitted) (?) furthering their ownselfish aims. The Bolshevists, Sheriodow and Gikalo are in touch with Astrakhan Bolshevistsagainst whom thousands of right-minded mountaineers are fighting in Denikin&apos;s ranks. England.is supplying Denikin with uniforms, guns, machine guns, tanks and aeroplanes and has seiit outinstructors for the above, ltwould.be a pity if it is after all.necessary to use these weaponsagainst mountaineers and if villages were destroyed.&apos;* Note by C. 2.-Telegram referred to is probably No. 82107 Of 4th November.
From Mr. Wardrop, Tiflis, to Foreign Office. .      &apos;(No. 127.) llth&apos;November, 1919.(? Your) Lordship is probably aware that Colonel Stokes has been living in this country,since departure of British troops without any employment though Foreign Office telegram 12,..13th September and my telegram (? 11) 10th September, simultaneously suggested that he wouldbe very useful as Political Agent in Azerbaijan.On his (? own) (? initiative) he has been in Baku lately and at my request he has given (? me)following: &quot;Supporters of Young Turk party are daily growing stronger on account of silence ofAllies and uncertainty as to fate of Azerbaijan.   Government does not wish Azerbaijan to becomean appanage of Turkey but it is weakening through inability to deny authenticity of assertion ofYoung Turk that Allies support Denikin in aggressive scheme(? s) (? against) Azerbaijan.A month has passed by since Rowlandson&apos;s proclamation and as it has not been disclaimed itis believed to have approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government. Denikin bombards Azerbaijan withprovocative communications and is believed to be inciting Armenia to be troublesome in Zangezurin order to divide Azerbaijan forces and make capture of Baku easier.Nuri, who had left Baku at the request of Ussubbekoff has now returned and unless Allieswish to drive (? Azerbaijan) into arms of Young Turks and conflct with Denikin some Alliedpolicy should be declared and some representative should be sent to Baku to keep in touch withand advise Azerbaijan.&quot;I am inclined to think that Colonel (? Stokes) perhaps exaggerates influence of Young Turks,but I agree with him in thinking that some early statement of Allied policy is most desirable. Acomparatively small (two groups undecipherable) (? at any place) in Trans Caucasia wheredisorder (? particularly) feared, presence of one or two British officers would generally preventtrouble.Repeated to Constantinople.From Denmiss, Taganrog, to War Office.(No. I.P. 2905.) &apos; 20th November, 1919.Several Tiflis papers publish that to representatives of so-called Mountain GovernmentWardrop stated (? unofficially): 1. That Rowlandson&apos;s speech to tribesmen was untactful, and expressed his (?) regretfor it.2. That (? British Mission) have no right to speak in name of British Government.3. That through Georgian Foreign Office he would publish in Press official communique&apos;throwing light on the Mountain Governments points of view regarding speech.If the above is true, / must protest against action of Wardrop on the ground, firstly, that(group undecipherable) so-called representative Mountaineers have been time and again publiclydisavoived by the tribunals they claim to represent, which from April onwards has been repeatedlyreported by this Mission, and. that official recognition of them by our representative (?) led Russiansto doubt the sincerity of our policy. Secondly, on one of my officers who was shortly (groupundecipherable) to address the tribesmen, who were being misled by agitators, serious aspersionshave been cast. I suggest that if Wardrop believes that the tribesmen are represented by the-so-called Mountain Government, he comes to Vladikavkas, where I will arrange interviewbetween him and the tribesmen, so that he can hear himself their own opinions on the subject.Repeated to Wardrop.From War Office to Denmiss, Taganrog.(No. 82531, cipher.  M.I.R.)    , 26th November, 1919.m Reference your No. IP. 2718 of 7th November. Rowlandson&apos;s speech was consideredinjudicious by foreign Office. Your difficulties are fully realized, but you should instruct yourofficers m their speech upon political matters to be extremely cautious. The references to &quot; GreatIndivisible Russia and the veiled threat of the use of British material against the Mountaineers-would have been better omitted.England knows that only a few and not all have risen. There are misguided people who-even now believe in the promises of the Bolshevists, but latter have never fulfilled any of theirpromises. End of Bolshevism is at hand as troops of&apos; Denikin are within 300 versts of Moscow,the distance between Baku and Petrovsk. There is no doubt that Russia cleansed by fire and? bloodshed will become great and&apos; indivisible. She will then repay in kind those who haveassisted in her resurrection and will straightaway punish those who have worked against hor..Please let everyone in your country know what I have said.&quot;To comment in my No, I.P. 92608, of 1st November, can only add that as to alleged:.? interview of journalist with General Cory nothing is known here. &apos;
