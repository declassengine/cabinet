I.-STATEMENT EXPLANATORY OFTHE NAVY ESTIMATES, 1919  1920.The Navy Estimates for 1919-20 as now presented to the House of Commonsamount to a net sum of 157,528,8001.This amount exceeds the forecast of 149,200,0001. shown in the White Paperpresented last March by 8,328,8001As was pointed out to the House of Commons at the time, the forecast made inMarch, although the best that could be made in the circumstances actually existing,was not in any sense a detailed estimate, the data for preparing which were not thenavailable.Since March additional items of expenditure some of which could not be fore-seen, whilst others, such as the improvement in pay for the personnel of the Navy, wereforeseen, but could not be estimated for have matured for inclusion in these Estimates.The chief of these items are as follow: &apos; Additional pay and pensions for the officers of the Fleet    -   2,400,000Additional pay and pensions for the men of the Fleet -     -  8,000,000Increase in rates of war gratuities and extension tomercantile officers employed in the Naval Service   -     -  3,000,000Transfer to Navy Votes of expenditure on account of hire ofvessels for naval purposes and freight of fuel and stores,which during the war was borne by the Ministry ofShipping      ---------   6,500,000Extra provision required for reconditioning of hired vessels   2,750,000Special requirements of fuel, &amp;c, owing to the presence of. the Fleet in Russian waters and Eastern Mediterranean -  4,250,000The total of the additional items of expenditure was slightly over 27,000,000Z.On the other hand, the progress of the peace negotiations and the consequentascertainment of many factors that were quite uncertain last March, and further, theclose review which the A dmiralty have since made of all services and expenditure,have made it possible to set off a reduction of 19,000,000Z. against the additional itemsreferred to.This reduction is accounted for to the extent of 9,000,000Z. by increasedappropriations in aid, chiefly in respect of receipts from the Allies for fuel suppliesand the sale of stocks of coal owing to the withdrawal of coal burning ships from theNavy.The resulting increase of 8,328,800Z. would have been less by about 3,000,000L butfor the decision that the proceeds of the sale of surplus naval war property dealt withby the Disposals Board should be credited to the Ministry of Munitions and not to theAdmiralty.In considering these Estimates, it should be remembered, in the first place, thattheir amount bears little relation to the requirements of the Navy for the current year.A large proportion of the sum required is to pay for work done and servicesrendered prior to the Armistice, for work put in hand before the Armistice and so farcarried out that it was not economical for it to be cancelled, for war gratuities ondemobilisation, for the pay and victualling of surplus personnel, and for other purelydead-weight war expenditure. No comparison can therefore profitably be madebetween the total figure and that of the pre-war Estimates.   Moreover, even if it wereo  (33) as 7839  Pk 3457. 30, 60  12/19  E&amp;S a 2
possible to disentangle the &quot;normal&quot; or &quot; peace&quot; expenditure, any such comparisonwould still be entirely fallacious until due allowance had been made for the factthat all material and services cost roughly twice what they did before the war.In the second place, it should be borne in mind that the conclusion of theArmistice, so far from finding the war effort of the nation on the decline, found us atthe height of our endeavour to win the war, and with every kind.of production andactivity to that end at its maximum. That this was so in the case of the Naval effortwill be seen from the following figures giving the actual expenditure during the(complete) war years :  1915-16    -     -     -     -     -     -  205,733,597 net1916-17     ......  209,877,218 net1917-18     ------  227,388,891 net1918-19     -.....  325,000,000 (estimated).Even these enormous figures, however, do not indicate fully the steep carve atthe height of which we stood in November 1918. The weekly rate of expenditure onthe Navy at the time of the Armistice was actually about 6,750,0001., or at the rateof more than 350,000,0001. a year.I append a summary of naval activities since the Armistice, and also somestatistical tables illustrating the size of the naval forces employed during the warand the provision which had to be made for their upkeep.Walter H. Long.-Admiralty,1st December 1919.
II.-SUMMABY OF NAVAL ACTIVITIESSINCE THE ARMISTICE.(A)-EMPLOYMENT OF THE FLEET.The conclusion of the Armistice, while freeing the Navy from its main task ofopposing the German Fleet, left several subsidiary campaigns uncompleted, besidesopening new theatres of operations in the Baltic and Black Seas.NORTH SEA.The services of the Navy were called upon in assisting to enforce the actualterms of the Armistice. Immediately upon its conclusion, the Grand Fleet wasengaged in taking over the German ships for internment, and escorting them toScapa Flow, whilst the Harwich Force took over the surrendered German Submarines.A portion of the main Fleet was constantly employed in watching the ships internedat Scapa Flow up to the 21st June, when the German ships were scuttled by theirown crews.On the 3rd December 1918, H.M.S. &quot; Hercules,&quot; accompanied by a light cruiserand four destroyers, proceeded to German waters with the Allied Naval ArmisticeCommission. These ships returned on the 20th December, and since that date one,and on occasions two, light cruisers have been visiting German ports on duties con-nected with the Armistice terms. Four destroyers have been allocated to conveyprovisions, despatches, &amp;c, to these ships. H.M. Ships have also assisted variouscommissions in the enforcement of agreements as to the surrender of materiel andGerman merchant shipping. The number of German merchant ships surrenderedup to 22nd November was 346.BALTIC.When, on the conclusion of the Armistice, the entrance to the Baltic Sea wasagain opened to surface ships, a naval force proceeded to the Baltic with the primaryobject of ensuring the supply of arms and munitions to Esthonia and Latvia.This force originally consisted of five light cruisers, nine destroyers, and twoauxiliary ships. The Admiral in Command was instructed that the policy of H.M.Government was to prevent the destruction of the Esthonian and Latvian provincesby external agency. He was, therefore, to employ his forces as necessary to preventaggression by Bolshevik forces against those territories.The British force operated in the Gulfs of Finland and Riga, and off the Coast ofLatvia until early in January 1919, when ice conditions forced a withdrawal toCopenhagen.   Several refugees were brought away from Libau and Riga.During this time the Bolshevik advance in Courland had progressed and on thewithdrawal of the British ships Riga fell into the hands of the Red Army.In January the naval force was reduced, but periodical visits to Libau werearranged.Early in April ice conditions once more permitted navigation of the Gulf ofFinland, and the menace to the Baltic States from Bolshevik ships again necessitatedthe presence of British ships at Revah This fact, and the further complicationintroduced by the attitude of the Germans in failing to evacuate their troops,rendered essential a gradual increase in the strength of the British naval forces.The duties falling on H.M. ships, in pursuance of the policy of aiding thenational Governments of the Baltic States, have&apos; consisted principally in their presenceat threatened ports, especially where the representatives on shore of the AlliedGovernments have required support, and also in the control of shipping and supplies inthe Baltic.&apos; Active hostilities were opened on 31st May, 1919, when a Bolshevik battleshipand four small vessels, accompanied by bombing aircraft, came out from Kronstadt.Fire was opened first by the Bolshevik vessels on our ships and this fire was returned.The discrepancy in strength of the two forces, the Bolshevik fleet counting battleshipsamong its units, necessitated the war being carried into the enemy&apos;s camp to ensurethe safety of our ships against surprise attack by superior forces.a :j
On the 17th June a Bolshevik cruiser was sunk by a single coastal motor boat inthe Gulf of Finland. An equally daring and gallant attack was carried out by a smallflotilla of coastal motor boats on Kronstadt Inner. Harbour on the 18th August. Theflotilla made its way through the chain of forts to the harbour and torpedoed severalvessels lying at anchor. The attack was carried out in co-operation with units of theRoyal Air Force, whose assistance was of the greatest value.Allied ships have from time to time been&apos; associated with the British forces.The political and military situation in the Baltic has remained confusedthroughout the autumn. An attempt to capture Petrograd by the North-WestRussian Army under General Yudenitch, assisted by Esthonian forces, gave promiseof success, but was followed by failure and retreat. The withdrawal of H.M. Shipsfrom the Eastern Baltic was subsequently ordered so as to coincide with the formationof ice.NORTH RUSSIA.At the time of the Armistice, the following British warships were in NorthRussian waters : -ivi   At Archangel, two monitors, four gunboats, and icebreaking vessels ;At Murmansk, battleship &quot; Glory &quot; ;At Peehenga, Russian cruiser &quot; Askold &quot; (manned by a British crew);with 20 small craft, which were distributed as their services were required.&quot; Askold&quot; was withdrawn in March 1919 and paid off. 250 Royal Marines, whohad been operating under the military on shore, returned to the United Kingdom inJune 19.19.&apos;Early in 1919 it was decided to reinforce the Naval Expedition at Archangel inorder that operations might be undertaken on the River Dwina as soon as the iceconditions permitted.The ships allocated for this purpose were : One light cruiser, six monitors, twogunboats, four minesweepers, a sloop, an aircraft carrier, a repair ship, and a largenumber of auxiliaries and small craft.These vessels assembled at Murmansk at the beginning of May, and proceeded toArchangel when the ice conditions allowed, the White Sea being open to navigationby the 5th June.The River Dwina, however, was clear of ice early in May, and this allowed theriver craft, which had been iced in at Archangel during the winter, to commenceoperations before the White Sea was open. By the 15th May two gunboats wereengaged on the River Vaga, while two monitors and two gunboats were co-operatingwith the military forces at Kurgomen on the River Dwina.By the middle of June the reinforcements from Great Britain had arrived atArchangel, and the Archangel River Expeditionary force supported the militaryforces in their operations on the Dwina during the summer.On the 21st July news was received of a mutiny among the Russian troopsco-operating with the British at Onega, as the result of which a force of about 850Royal Marines was despatched from the United Kingdom to Murmansk to act underthe military authorities, the monitor &quot; Erebus,&quot; armed with 15-inch guns, being sentto the White Sea at the same time.In consequence of the turn which events took, it was decided that the plans,already made for the evacuation of North Russia before the winter set in should beproceeded with at once, as soon as the necessary transport could be sent out. Tofacilitate the evacuation, a heavy blow was to be delivered against the Bolsheviks,thus enabling the North Russians to occupy our positions as we withdrew.An advance up the river ended with the capture of Chidinova and Borok,in which the River Force participated, being in action during the second week inAugust against the Bolshevik Flotilla. On the withdrawal of the expedition theriver was heavily mined, this measure effectively impeding the movements of enemycraft.     ;- -        ; , &apos;   , : &apos;&apos;,    &apos;,Throughout all the river operations valuable assistance was rendered byseaplanes of the R.A.F. in reporting the dispositions of the enemy and in spotting for**our gunfire and bombing the enemy&apos;s positions.The evacuation of the British and Allied forces from Archangel was completedwithout hitch by the 27th September. All the naval forces were withdrawn excepttwo monitors. These could not be brought down stream owing to the shallownessof the water, and were demolished in the river/after they had been dismantled andall material of value removed.
With, the exception oi a few transport craft, and two minesweepers which werewrecked during minesweeping operations, these were the only ships lost by theexpedition.The war vessels and other craft evacuated from Archangel proceeded toMurmansk to assemble there for final departure to the United Kingdom. Theevacuation of Murmansk was completed on the 12th October.BLACK SEA.Since the arrival of the Allied. Fleets at Constantinople, after the cessation ofhostilities, British naval forces have been engaged in enforcing the terms of theArmistice with Turkey and in assisting General Denikin and his Volunteer Army inoperations against the Bolsheviks.When the Bolsheviks had occupied Sebastopol and had driven the Volunteertroops from the greater part of the Crimea, the support of the British ships held upthe attempted Bolshevik advance into the Kertch peninsula, and eventually enabledthe Volunteer Army to recapture the whole of the Crimea. Similarly in the Sea ofAzov and elsewhere the Volunteer Army was supported by the gunfire of our ships.When the Volunteer Army had retaken Nicolaief from the enemy they weresupported by our ships in the landing operations that led up to the recapture ofOdessa. In fact, the co-operation of the British Navy rendered possible the expulsionof the Bolsheviks from the whole of the northern coast of the Black Sea.CASPIAN SEA.Before the Armistice the importance of the control of the Caspian for the defenceof our Indian interests had been realised, and ships had been taken over and mannedby British naval personnel. After the Armistice this policy was actively developed.The use of the Sea was denied to the Bolsheviks; Baku was occupied and its oilsupply was made available for the Russian Volunteer forces; and the right flank ofthe British forces in the Caucasus was protected.Our ships operated in the Northern Caspian during General Denikin&apos;s advancetowards Astrakhan. Several actions were fought with the Bolsheviks, culminating ina very gallant attack, on the 21st May 1919, on the Bolshevik Fleet at Fort Alexan-drovsk, where they had established a base. Several of the enemy ships were sunk,and the remainder fled to Astrakhan. After this action the Bolsheviks never againshowed fight on the Caspian Sea and their demoralisation greatly assisted GeneralDenikin in holding Tsaritsyn, a place of capital strategic importance. The ships havenow been handed over to the Russian Volunteer forces, and the British personnelwithdrawn.An incidental but important feature of the presence of the British Navy in boththe Caspian and Black Seas has been the re-opening for trade of districts that hadbeen closed to British enterprise for five years past.SIBERIA.A British man-of-war has been maintained at Vladivostok, and has worked inco-operation with the British Military Mission supporting Admiral Koltchak. Navalguns were mounted on an armoured train which was used with conspicuous successon the Ufa front. These guns were afterwards mounted in barges and steamers onthe River Kama, being finally turned over to the Russians, and the British navalpersonnel being withdrawn.GENERAL SERVICE ABROAD.Besides the active operations that had to be undertaken in Russian waters, theNavy has played a prominent part in assisting to maintain peace and order throughoutthe world during the unrestful period of resettlement that has followed the Armistice.Adriatic.In the Adriatic, British light cruisers and destroyers co-operated with Alliedforces in controlling the situation at Austrian ports and on the Dalmatian coast.Danube.Gunboats and motor launches have been employed on the Danube in enforcingthe terms of the Armistices.A i
iEgean.&apos; In the iEgean Sea the Navy, besides maintaining communications from Malta toour forces in the Black Sea, took part in the operations during which Allied forceswere landed at Smyrna.Egypt.During the disturbances in Egypt the Navy kept open communications bywireless and assisted generally in controlling the situation.Red Sea.In the Red Sea the Navy co-operated with the Military in operations at Hodeidaand on the Somaliland coast. British ships were also employed until the end ofAugust in controlling the dhow traffic in the Red Sea.China.The river patrols on the Yangtze and West River have been re-established, andthe British Commander-in-Chief has carried out a cruise on the former river, theBritish flag being shown again at many ports where it had not been seen since beforethe war, and at ports on the West River tributaries where the White Ensign hasnever previously been seen.Other Foreign Stations.At the present time the principal ports of all stations are being visited for thepurpose of showing the flag where it has not been seen since before the war, and,where necessary, preserving order and protecting British subjects.H.M.S. &quot; Renown.&quot;H.M.S. &quot; Renown &quot; left Portsmouth on the 5th August to convey CaptainH.R.H. thePrince of Wales to Canada, and was met at St. John&apos;s by two light cruiser s, whichsubsequently returned to England. After visiting the West Indies and Rio deJaneiro the latter place in order to return a visit paid by a Brazilian Squadronto England &quot;&apos;Renown&quot; returned to New York, where she embarked H.R.H. andsailed for Halifax and England on 22nd November, escorted by a light cruiser.HOME WATERS.Assistance to Civil Power.The situation in Ireland has necessitated the fairly continuous employment inIrish waters of six destroyers, three sloops, and 16 motor launches. These numbershave been increased temporarily from time to time.During the period of industrial unrest that has followed the Armstice in GreatBritain, the Navy has been called upon to help the Government in maintainingessential public services. . v-,w &apos;   ..1,500 officers and men were engaged on pumping duty in the West Yorkshirecoalfield during the coal strike of July and August.In August, H.M.S. &quot;Valiant&quot; and two destroyers were stationed at Liverpool incase they were required during the police strike.During the railway strike, in September and October, ships were used forcarrying food round the coast, especially for the carriage of yeast, and for conveyingmilitary forces; other were held in. readiness for diverting sea-borne traffic, andmaintaining wireless communication. Personnel was landed for the protection&apos; ofcertain vulnerable positions and the working of various dock gates and power stationsround the coast.Mine Patrols.Destroyers have been employed to cope with the drifting mine danger at variouspoints, mainly on. the East Coast. .Atlantic Flight.Two battle-cruisers were stationed in the Atlantic to assist in the flight of therigid airship R 34 to and from the United States.Exercises, Cruises, and Ceremonies.In view of the many calls on the Fleet for other purposes, little opportunity hasoccurred for fleet exercises or cruises.
Squadrons of the Atlantic Fleet paid a visit to French ports in April, and officersand men of the Squadrons were entertained in Paris by the French Government,together with Admiral of the Fleet Sir David Beatty, who had hauled down his flag afew days earlier.Representative detachments from the Fleet took part in the Victory marches bothin Paris (14th July) and London (19th July). A portion of the Atlantic Fleet paid avisit to the Thames during this week, and visits to it were arranged for Members ofthe Houses of Parliament.The summer cruise of the Atlantic &quot;Fleet commenced on the 2nd September, visitsbeing paid by units of the Fleet to various seaports round the British coast. Exerciseswere subsequently carried out.MINE -CLEARANCE.One of the largest tasks that confronted the Allied Navies after the cessation ofhostilities was that of clearing the seas of mines, which had been used in this war ona quite unprecedented scale.The waters to be swept were distributed among the Allies according to theirresources, those allotted to the British comprising the coasts of the British Isles, theNorth Sea as far east as Long. 40 E,, and various areas in the Mediterranean andabroad.Some idea of the task involved may be gathered from the fact that during thewar no less than 1,360 minefields or groups of mines were laid by the Germans inproximity to our coast, totalling some 11,000 mines, about 90 per cent, of which werelaid by submarines ; in waters abroad to be cleared by the British about 60 fields orgroups, totalling some 1,200 mines, about 60 per cent, of which were laid bysubmarines, while British mines, which had also to be swept up, numbered about65,000 in home waters and 8,000 in the Mediterranean.The arrangements for the organisation of the Mine Clearance Service had beenworked out in detail before the Armistice, and were brought into force on the 1stDecember 1918. Home waters were divided into areas and placed under minoclearance officers, who received operational orders direct from the Admiralty; mineclearance officers were also appointed to act under the Commanders-in-Chief abroad.Other bases were established at Lervikstord in Norway, and at Zeebrugge andYmuiden.The number of mines known to have been laid during the war being no criterionof the number remaining to be swept up, it was decided to cover all localities in whichmines were laid twice, and. where necessary, three times ; and forces were allocated tothe various mine clearance officers w ith a view to this work being accomplished by theend of November 1919.. When operations were fairly started about 1,000 vessels wereemployed in all areas. By the 1st April 1919 these had been reduced to 421, by1st July to 285, and by 17th October to under 100.The ships employed were at first manned by the officers and men who had beenengaged on minesweeping and patrol duties during the war. In order to enable thesemen to take their proper turn for demobilisation if they so desired, this arrangementwas speedily&apos; replaced by one under which volunteers for this special duty wereinvited to sign on for a period of three months, receiving extra pay for the risksinvolved.This was a temporary expedient only until a distinct mine clearance forcecould be formed, on a definite engagement to serve until the 30th November1919. On the inauguration of this force on the 1st April 1919, volunteers cameforward in large numbers, and the force was quickly brought up to its authorisedstrength of about 600 officers and 15,000 men.In spite of the re-arrangements and complications involved by these changes in themanning system, the difficulties have been so successfully overcome by the officersconcerned in the organisation and operation of the force, that the work of mineclearance has been accomplished well within the scheduled time. The discipline ofthe force was good and its spirit excellent.It was laid down as the primary principle in the clearance operations that allpossible precautions were to be taken to obviate loss of life. Risks had frequently tobe taken; in the northern barrage, for example, mines had been laid only 6 feetbelow the surface at low water, while the slight tidal range was nullified, as a rule, bymotion caused by the sea. Here a special form of sweep was devised which to a large1extent protected the vessels engaged; and generally risks were reduced to a minimumby working tidal restrictions and utilising the co-operation of aircraft as much aspossible. So well were precautions observed that the total loss of life during theoperations has amounted only to the very low figure of &apos; 6 per cent.o as 7839 . b
Mine clearance operations in the areas allotted to Great Britain are nowcomplete, and these areas are open to navigation and are, it can be confidently-asserted, free of moored mines. Until the minefields, for which Great Britain is notresponsible, are cleared, drifting mines will continue to be present for some time, andwill constitute a small but unavoidable danger to navigationIn addition to mine clearance operations proper, large areas have been bottomswept with particular regard to fishing grounds.This form of sweeping is still in progress, and will be. continued after 30thNovember&apos;by the Post-War Minesweeping Flotilla (manned by permanent navalratings) as opportunity occurs.BELGIAN COAST RECONSTRUCTION.Under the direction of the Admiralty various works of salvage and reconstructionhave been carried out on the Belgian coast, at the cost of the Belgian Government.The work included the dredging of the port of Ostend, the repair of the largemaritime dock and the reconstruction of the lock gates; the erection of a semi-permanent fixed bridge over the Nouvel Avant-P.ort in place of the swing bridgedestroyed by the Germans, the provision of 15 travelling cranes of portal type, thereconstruction of the railway system in the docks, and other works. At Zeebruggethe damaged swing bridges over the entrance lock to the Zeebrugge-Bruges Canalhave been rebuilt, the caissons closing the lock entrance and other portions of thelock repaired, the gap in the viaduct leading to the Mole restored, and 10 travellingcranes of portal type have been erected on the Mole. All this work has now beencompleted.Dredging operations commenced at Ostend at the end of January and continuednight and day. At the same time salvage work was carried on upon the remains ofH.M.S. &quot; Vindictive&quot; and of small craft which had been sunk in the harbour by theGermans. By the 15th June salvage and dredging had been carried so far that cross-channel services into Ostend could be resumed without involving delays due to tides.At Zeebrugge the s.s. &quot;Brussels,&quot; which had been sunk off the end of the Mole,and various smaller craft, were lifted, and the cranes, railway wagons, and other gearthat the Germans had thrown into the harbour, salved. ,(B) READJUSTMENT TO PEACE CONDITIONS.The many duties that devolved upon the Fleet during the clearing-up periodmilitated against rapid demobilisation or an early return to peace strength.FLEET AT HOME.Between the 11th November 1918 and the signing of the peace treaty in June, itwas necessary to keep the Fleet in Home waters at a very full strength, both onaccount of operational necessities, especially in the Baltic (the ships for which areprovided from the Home organisation), and because active measures might have beennecessary to induce the Germans to sign the peace treaty.Early in December 1918, however, orders were given for a considerable numberof ships in Home waters to proceed to their Home ports and grant their crews the28 days&apos; demobilisation leave that had been specially approved. These ships werethose required to prepare for Foreign Service, or. to reduce to &quot; Home Fleet&quot; status orReserve, so that by the end of March many squadrons that had been in existence at-the time of the Armistice had already disappeared.A further reorganisation was made when Admiral of the Fleet Sir David Beattyhauled down his flag on the 7th April.   On that date the Grand Fleet ceased to&apos;.exist, and the new &quot;Atlantic Fleet&quot; came into being.   It was at first intended,that a Home Fleet should be formed of ships manned by nucleus crews; but con-si derations of economy necessitated an additional reduction, and the ships designatedfor the Home Fleet are now to be laid up &quot;in Reserve.&quot;
When this reduction has been effected, the position of the fully-commissionedfleet at home, as compared with the Grand Fleet at the time of the Armistice, will beas follows: Rattle Squadrons - - - - - Reduced from 4 to 2.Battle Cruiser Squadrons - ,,     ,,    2 ,&apos;, 1.Cruiser Squadrons    - -     -     - 2 ,, 0.Flying Squadron      -     -     - - 1 ,, 1 ship.Light Cruiser Squadrons - ; - - - ,, ,, 7 2.Destroyer Flotillas    - -     -     -       ,,     ,,    6 ,, 4.Submarine Flotillas  -     -     -     -     -       ,, 6,,3   of   muchsmaller size.Fleets weeping Flotillas     -     -     -     -       ,,     ,,    3 ,, 0.Minelayers......,,      ,,1 squadron and 1flotilla to 1 ship.Apart from the main fleets, the auxiliary, patrol organisation comprised at thetime of the Armistice 27 separate areas or commands with bases round the coast.The Auxiliary Patrol was broken up after the Armistice, and the 27 commands haveby now been reduced to the five Commander-in-Chiefs&apos; commands at Chatham,Devonport, Portsmouth, Rosyth, and Queenstown. A few other bases have beenretained temporarily to cope with the work of demobilisation and reconditioning, bothwhich duties will shortly cease.Large destroyer and submarine forces, additional to those already enumerated,were attached to 12 of these local commands. These have been laid up, wiih theexception of four small defence flotillas based respectively on Chatham, Portsmouth,Devonport, and the Firth of Forth, and of the Irish force mentioned on p. 8.Three semi-independent submarine-hunting forces, which had been constituted priorto the Armistice, have been similarly disbanded.The majority of the ships withdrawn from the various Home commands havebeen placed in the Reserve, or on the list of ships for disposal. A certain numberhave been attached to the Gunnery, Torpedo, Wireless, and Navigation Schools fortraining and experimental purposes; the number of these is greater than beforethe war, in accordance with the policy that special attention must be paid to trainingand experimental wrork. With the same object peace establishments for training insubmarine and anti-submarine work are being maintained at Portsmouth and Portland.Vessels are being detailed for surveying and lishery protection duties.FOREIGN STATIONS.The large forces of armed merchant cruisers, ocean escorts, and smallervessels which were employed on convoy duty against submarines and raiders havebeen demobilised.Mediterranean.The Mediterranean Station at the end of the war was under a Commander-in-Chief, with five sub-divisions, each under a Rear-Admiral or Commodore, viz. : Gibraltar, Malta, the Adriatic, the ZEgean, and Egypt. This territorial arrangementis being superseded by the peace organisation, which comprises a Commander-in-Chief,one Rear-Admiral in the Battle Squadron, one Rear-Admiral commanding the LightCruiser Squadron, and Officers-in-Oharge of the bases at Malta and Gibraltar.Officers are being retained temporarily in command of the Egypt and iEgeandivisions to complete the process of demobilisation, and to be available in any,political emergency that may arise from the disturbed conditions of these areas.The battleships, light cruisers, and torpedo craft which were employed in theMediterranean at the time of the Armistice have all returned, and the process ofreplacing them by more modern vessels is nearly complete. A large proportion ofthe auxiliaries on the station have been returned to their owners, and the remainderare being brought home as rapidly as the progress of demobilisation and the politicalsituation allow. The assistance rendered&apos;-. by naval craft to the Army and AirForce in their arrangements for demobilisation and evacuation of bases has affectedthe rate of withdrawal.   ,America.The commands on the coast of America consisted at the Armistice of threestations, North  America&apos; and West Indies, East Coast of South America, and
Pacific Coast of America. These have been replaced by two commands under theCommander-in-Chief, North America and West Indies, and the Oommander-in-Chief,South America respectively. The old ships on these and on the Africa, China, andEast Indies Stations have been withdrawn, and the more modern ships which are toreplace them are being sent out as crews become available.Australia.The Australian Station has reverted to the control of the CommonwealthGovernment.DEMOBILISATION OP PERSONNEL.The strength of the Navy at the date of the Armistice (including the MercantileMarine Reserve but excluding (the Royal Naval Division) was 415,162. Of these,36,243 were officers and 378,919 men. About 24,000 officers and 235,500 menwere serving on engagements expiring at the conclusion of the war.The following figures show the progress of demobilisation up to the middle ofNovember: Mid.1)Numbers Demobilised (including M.M.E.and excluding R.N.D.).Officers.January -FebruaryMarchAprilMayJuneJulyAugust -SeptemberOctober -November1,8004,0006.0008,20011,50013,60016,10017,40018,60019,70020,900Men.25,00092,000140,000168,000189,000202,000213,000220,000226,000229,000232,000The demobilisation of officers and men serving in Home waters was carried outunder a standardised procedure from all ships and establishments concurrently, thusavoiding the use of dispersal centres.Owing to the number of ships that had still to be kept in commission, demobilisa-tion had at first to be kept carefully in hand ; but in spite of this it was found possibleto release over 7,000 officers and 154,000 men by the end of March.The repatriation of the Colonial Naval Reserves, amounting to over 2,000, and ofabout the same number of men who had come from abroad to join the ImperialNaval Forces, was effected at a comparatively early stage.The strength of the Women&apos;s Royal Naval Service was at the time of theArmistice 4,821 of all ranks.   This force has now been demobilised.Apart from the demobilisation of officers and men due for discharge, it is intendedto reduce the permanent personnel of the Navy by the end of December to somewhatbelow the total voted for 1914-15. Men who apply for their discharge will thereforebe permitted to take it, provided that they belong to branches in which a surplus exists,and that the total numbers so discharged do not exceed a certain figure; and a higherstandard of character and ability than was possible during the war will be insistedupon in future both for first entry and for re-engagement. The extent of subsequentreductions will depend upon the strength at which the Fleet is to be maintained infuture years, a question which is being considered in connection with the provisionrequired for 1920-21.      &quot;NAVAL PAY.One of the most urgent needs at the time of the Armistice was the preparation ofrevised scales of pay for the officers and men of the Fleet. The existing rates hadbeen increased but slightly during the previous 60 years, and had quite lost touchwith the prevailing value of money and the salaries and wages obtainable in civil life.
Committees were appointed to suggest new scales in detail, and pending theirreports ad interim increases were brought into force as from the 1st February 1919.The revised rates were finally approved by the Government in May 1919, andbesides effecting a considerable simplification in the scales in force at the time of theArmistice, provided a substantial increase over those scales. This increase, thoughvarying between the different ranks and ratings, averaged about 100 per cent.At the same time the scale of allowances for officers and men, of half and retired,pay for officers, and of long service pensions for men, were brought under review, andimprovements in them were effected.NAVAL EDUCATION.During the war it was not possible to give officers and men normal courses ofinstruction, with the result that on the conclusion of the Armistice there wereconsiderable arrears to be made up.All the Naval Educational Establishments, many of which had been closedduring thewar, were re-opened as soon as possible, and every effort has beenmade to resume fully the teaching of professional subjects. In addition a seriesof educational courses, each lasting six months, has been instituted at Cambridge forjunior Officers who had been unable owing to the war to complete their full trainingin the cadet colleges.   The first of these courses was begun in January last.The R.N. College, Keyham, which during the war was used for the training ofspecial entry cadets, is now being used, as was previously intended, for the trainingof Engineer Officers.Reference is made below, under the heading &quot; Naval Staff Organisation,&quot; to theinstitution of a Naval Staff College at Greenwich.REVISION OP SHIPBUILDING PROGRAMME.Of the vessels under construction at the time of the Armistice, those werecompleted whose construction had proceeded so far that cancellation would have beenuneconomical having regard to the, possibility of their useful employment upon navaland other work.

ADMIRALTY OUTPORT ESTABLISHMENTS.The reduction of the material and personnel of the Navy has. already begun tohave its effect upon the amount of work thrown upon the corresponding CivilEstablishments, and a considerable decrease in the staff has been effected.Home.The following is a comparison of the numbers employed on the 11th November1918 and 1st November 1919 :-(a) Office Staff:-11.11.18.	1.11.19.-   6,615	6,0313,205	1,692-   9,820	7,723-105,024	85,832Men -     - ..   -     -    *.Women  -Totals-(b) Industrial Staff       -     .     -     -The Victualling Depot at Grangemouth and the Naval Gun Factory at West-houghton have been closed; the.

Totals    - -     -    10,637 8,461The process of reduction will continue steadily, but it must be borne in mindthat for the time being the work, of the Department has been considerably augmentedin i various directions as a result of demobilisation. The following are instances ofthe additional work devolving upon the staff: Issue of war gratuities to naval officers and men to the   amount of11,500,0001.Revision of rates of pay of all officers and men and payment of arrearsconsequent on the ante-dating of the new schemes.!     Preparation of rolls for issue of prize money.Preparation of rolls for award of war medals and clasps.The staff required for these temporary purposes to some extent neutralises thelarge reductions made in other directions.NAVAL STAFF ORGANISATION.At the outbreak of the war, both the development of the Naval Staff organisationand the provision of more adequate mieans of training officers for Naval Staff workwere receiving close attention.The experience of the war has not only provided confirmation, if any wereheeded, of the great importance of these two subjects, but has also made it easier to. decide what are the best lines to follow in dealing with them.- As regards the Naval Staff organisation, it is intended that this shaU comprise-eight directorates, viz., Plans, Operations, Local Defence, Communications, Intelli-gence, Trade, Gunnery and Torpedo, and Training and Staff Duties.B 4As regards the Dockyards, the volume of refitting and reconditioning work to heperformed required for a time the retention of almost the full numbers employedduring the war. The Admiralty have also adopted the policy of diverting to theDockyards the work of Completing ships under construction in private yards whichstill require a considerable amount of work but are too far finished to be cancelled,thus facilitating the output of merchant shipbuilding^ in the private yards.The point, however, was reached in the autumn when the diminished amount ofnaval work falling upon the Dockyards made it necessary to begin to reduce thenumbers of workpeople employed to something approaching pre-war numbers. A.scheme of gradual reduction was therefore -arranged for, under which discharges atthe average rate of 800 workpeople would for the present be made weekly from theHome Dockyards as a whole. It was believed that this gradual rate of reductionwould enable the bulk of the men affected to find employment in the merchantshipbuilding centres where the supply of labour is stated to be inadequate. DuringNovember it appeared that this expectation was not being fully realised, and thewhole question is now receiving the most careful consideration with the object ofalleviating the situation as much as possible.A committee has been set up under the presidency of Lord Colwyn, and includingrepresentatives of the Government, the workpeople and the localities concerned, toinvestigate the possibility of utilising for commercial purposes such part of thebuilding and repairing facilities at the Yards as are not required for naval work inthe immediate future, and it is hoped that the advice received from this committeewill be of considerable assistance to the Admiralty.Foreign.At the time of the Armistice some 19,400 were employed in these Establishments,and a reduction of between 3,500 and 4,000 had been effected by the end of October1919, while discharges are still proceeding.ADMIRALTY OFFICE PERSONNEL.,. The reduction in the Admiralty staff made between the 11th November 1918 andthe 1st November 1919 was as follows :-11.11.18. 1.11.19.Men.....-     -     6,065 5,554 .Women      -     -     -     -     -     -     4,572 :., . 2,907
At the Armistice the number of Officers in the Naval Staff was 336. This hadbeen reduced by October 1919 to 170, and it is estimated that a reduction to 120can be effected by the end of the year. It is possible that the complement maybe still further reduced when some of the pressing problems arising out of the warhave been dealt with, but an adequate and well-organised Naval Staff must consistof considerably larger numbers than were included in the embryonic War Staff thatexisted before the war.Two years before the war a course of training for War Staff officers had beeninstituted at the War College ; but on the 4th June 1919 a separate Naval StaffCollege was opened at&apos; Greenwich. The course lasts for 12 months, and there areat present taking it 16 Naval, two Military, and two Air Force Officers. So far ascan be judged at the present stage it promises to prove of great benefit, not onlyto the Navy directly, but also in furtherance of the co-operation between theServices. ^On the first inception of a Staff College the course must be tentative, and it maytake a few years before it assumes a definite form ; much must depend upon thepractical results of the course, as shown by the subsequent staff work of thoseofficers who will pass through the College during the first few sessions.The War College, which is a separate institution, devoted to the higher navaleducation of more senior officers, will be re-opened early next year.In addition an introductory war course has been included in the syllabus forjunior officers at Cambridge. It is hoped to continue this course in the future, asit is very desirable that those officers who have a bent for Naval Staff work shouldboth &quot; find themselves &quot; and become known to the Admiralty at an early stage.SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH.. The Admiralty have since the Armistice given close attention to the question of theprovision or supply of experimental types of newly-clesigned material, and to thepolicy to be adopted in regard to research for naval purposes.A scientific adviser to the Admiralty was appointed in the latter part of thewar, and the post will he placed on a permanent footing under the title of Directorof Scientific Research. The officer holding this position will maintain the closestpossible touch with all outside institutions and scientific bodies which are investigatingproblems in pure or applied research having a more or less direct bearing on possiblenaval requirements. This will ensure that the Admiralty do not waste effort andmoney in undertaking experimental research work which is already in progresselsewhere.NAVAL FORCES OF INDIA AND THE DOMINIONS.At the request of the Governments of India and the Dominions, Admiral of theFleet Viscount Jellicoe is engaged on a tour of the Empire in IT.M.S. &quot; New Zealand.&quot;Lord Jellicoe is reporting to each Government his recommendations for the reorga-nisation and development of the local naval forces. The views of the variousGovernments on these reports must be ascertained and discussed with them beforea naval policy for all parts of the Empire can be formulated.In the meantime the Dominion Governments have been asked whether they wishto have any vessels that are on the Admiralty list of ships for disposal, in additionto the following ships which have been already allocated : Australia.Submarine Flotilla     -     -     -     -     &quot; Platypus &quot; (Depot ship) and Jl, J2, J3,J4, J5, J7.Flotilla Leader   -     -     -     -     -     &quot;Anzac.&quot;T.B.D.&apos;s......&quot; Stalwart,&quot;0 &quot; Success,&quot;0 &quot;Swordsman,&quot;*&quot; Tasmania,&quot;0 &quot;Tattoo.&quot;0   .Sloops (Minesweeping)      -     -     -     &apos;&apos;Geranium,&quot; &quot; Mallow,&quot;Marguerite.&quot;Canada.Submarines......HI 4, IT15.Temporarily in reserve in England.

Ships, Dockyards, Transport and CommercialVessels at Home and Abroad : Tons.(a) British Coal      -....... 36,000,000(b) Coal from India, South Africa, &amp;c. 1,250,000(2) Despatched by rail, principally to East Coast Bases - - - 6^30o!o00(3) Shipped for British Expeditionary Force ----- 2,950^000(4) Shipped for Allies prior to establishment of Ministry of Shipping 7,&apos;500,00054,000,000The maximum number of colliers employed at any one time bythe Admiralty for all services was -                  -     - 563with an aggregate carrying capacity of about -     -     - 2,147,000 tons.The average number employed in Home Waters was about     - 200Carrying capacity   ---------     - 470,000 tons.
Apart from meeting Naval and Transport needs, the Admiralty undertookthe responsibilities throughout for coal supplies to the British Expeditionary Force,for the U.S. Navy in British and Mediterranean waters, and also? until the establish-ment of the Ministry of Shipping, for the French and Italian Marine, the French StateRailways and other services. The unavoidable dislocation of the bunkering tradenecessitated provision being also made by the Navy for the bunkering of BritishCommercial and Allied Transports, and other vessels.Oil Fuel. /. , f ,The total amount of oil brought to British Bases throughoutthe war exceeded.....- 10,000,000 tons.Supplies derived from home sources -     -     -     - 350,000 tons.Issues to the Fleet........ 9,100,000 tons.Issues to Allies (excluding U.S.N.)    ----- 500,000 tons.In addition American Naval tankers imported   - 560,000 tons,which was distributed coastwise by small British craft to U.S. Naval Units.Owing to the rapid increase in the oil-burning fleet and the high standardof consumption resulting from the anti-submarine campaign, convoy and escortsystems, &amp;c, the oil expenditure of 1914 had practically quadrupled four yearslater.The available tankers being inadequate to cope either with the import require-ments or with the need for Fleet auxiliaries, a large building programme wasprojected in the early stages of the war and subsequently amplified. This programmeresulted in the following additions to the oil-carrying fleet: Carrying capacity.Cargo tankers.......  52     380,000 tons.Fleet auxiliaries    - -     -     -     -     -  49       96,000 tons.The inadequacy of the supply of tankers and the large number of casualtiesto&apos; vessels en route, necessitated supplementing tanker imports from 1917 onwards bythe use of double bottoms of cargo steamers.Deliveries by this method amounted to 1,100,000 tons.Petrol.The great extension of the Naval Air Service and the introduction of petrolburning motor launches, coastal motor boats, and motor transport created anexceedingly high demand for petrol for Naval purposes. To meet requirementspetrol installations were set up at numerous points round the coast of GreatBritain and at certain stations abroad; supplies being regulated by rail or coastaltransport.XI.
