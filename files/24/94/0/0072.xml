e).(Thin document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;a Government)CABINET.4th REPORT Ow C^BHTIB C,0W&apos;OTTFE OH IRFL/ND.1.P.268.Ifcw;TOORAWDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR,In the 4th report of the Committee on Ireland, theCommittee have modified the machinery which they proposedshould operate in the interval between the date of thecoming into force of the Home Rule Act and the Union ofIreland, in a way which directly affects the Ministry ofLabour,The Committee now propose to transfer to theParliaments of North and South Ireland powers with respectto unemployment insurance and employment exchangeswhich were reserved to the Imperial Government for oneyear under the scheme propounded in their 3rd report. The&apos;proposal, ps I now understand, is that the legislative aswell as the; administrative nower in relation to Employmenti:xchan.?es and Unemployment Insurance in Ireland should bein the hands of separate authorities each having jurisdictionover a ppro of the country.   With regard to the primaryfunctions of the Employment Exchanges (i.e. receivingnotification of vacancies f &quot;om employers .and the registrationof unemployed workmen, and brin^ino; the two together) , sucha separation would render their efficient working Impossible.The arrangements for transferring workpeople from &quot;mepart of the country to another would become impossible. Itis conceivable also that one legislature might abolishexchanges altogether (though not if Unemployment Insurancewere retained), *nd this would still further reduce theusefulness of the Exchanges that were left.The difficulties of separation as regards UnemploymentInsurance are equally serious,   Fach legislature would havethe power to set up a scheme of its own, Bhd the resultwould probably be that there would be differences between thetwo schemes a.3 regards the trades covered, the rates ofcontribution and. benefit, and even as&quot;regards the conditionsunder which benefit is ^ayable.   Owin^ to the interchange oflabour, workpeople would some times come under one schemeand some tines under another, and this.would cause continualdifficulty and friction, and would also make It very difficultto keen the finances of the two schemes in order.   The TradeUnions usually cover the whole country and would beexasperated by the existence o-J the two separate schemes;&apos;not only would they have to deal with two separate authoritiesin order to protect the interests of their members, but thearrangements for the co-operation of the Trade Unions In the.administration-of unemployment Insurance would probably bedifferent and would necessitate two different sets of TradeUnion/
Q1 9o J.. IriUnion rulest   The only way of avoiding these difficultieswould be by means of some central authority which wouldbe empowered to co-ordinate the schemes for the two portsof Ireland and, if necessary, to over-ride the senaratelegislatures, but this of course is really inconsistentwith the governing principle of the proposal.The only feasible scheme would appear to me toreserve these services to the Imperial Legislature.R.S.H0RNE.9.12.19.
