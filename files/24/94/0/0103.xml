(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HI 8 -BRITANNIC HATESTY1S GOVERNMENT.)SECRET.( .)     O4 P.- 299.374CABINET..OLD AGE PENSIONS..Memorandum &quot;by the Chancellor .of tho Exchequer.The Cabinet Cornfl.ittoo on Old Age Pensions have inconformity with the provisional decision of the Cabinet con-.sidered the question of adopting a means limit which shallbe lower than the doubled limit suggested in the MinorityReport of the Committee on Old Age Pensions..     They recommendthat the new scale should run from  26. s.-0d a year (slightlyover 10s.. a week) to  47.5s.0d. a year (slightly over l8s.ajweek), in steps of   ..  s.0... per-annum a about 2/- a week.The result will be that persons with private means of 10s.. aweek will receive a maximum pension of 10s,   Persons withl8s. a week-will receive a minimum pension of 2s. a week,bringing their total means up to  1 a week.Any estimates of cost are highly speculative but theCabinet Committee are advised that this scale will probablybring in about ,220,000 new pensioners as compared with350,000 who would be brought in by doubling the existingmeans scale.The saving involved will be about x 4,000,000 perannum, possibly in&apos;the first year rather mere.Under this scheme it is estimated that, as comparedwith the existing expenditure upon Old Age Pensions,(including the additional allowance of 2a.6d. du-ing the War)ofThese are considered preferable to Is,, steps as involvinga less close assessment of means and therefore a lessfrequent reassessment of pensions when means vary.x This is based on Sir A. Wat son&apos;s estimate that the averagepension under the new scale wiH be  24.7a.Q. per annum,i.e. about 9s.4d. a week, instead of  25*  s.-0. ,asestimated by Sir F, Clarke.    1,000,000 of the saving istherefore due to a reduction of the original estimate ofthe cost of a doubled means limit.
3 9 ^  *of about  17,650,000&apos; por annum,, the expenditure in futurewill bo about x  8,&apos;000,000 por annum, an increase of rathe;over  10,000,000&apos; per annum of which nearly  6,000,000 is /to increasing existing pensions and the balance to bringjoh: to the.Pension list a frosh&apos;body of pensioners at-the n^higher &quot;rate of pension.The Cabinet Committee also recommend for adoption :-(l)   The proposals -contained in the Minority Report,page 16, with regard to&apos; the-calculation of means and ,(2)   The unanimous recommendations of the Committeewith regard to the Poor Law disqualification, and tocertain minor alterations&apos; in&apos;the conditions under whichpensions are at present paid.The complete scheme to be embodied in legislationmay be summarised as follows1.- The maximum pension will in future be 10s, aweek as recommended in both Reports,   the additional allowanceof 2s.6d. a week given by administrative action duringthe War will -he absorbed in the new scale and the administra-tive concessions with regard to the calculation by means ofexisting pensioners will also be terminated, subject, ifnecessary, to some temporary provision for existing interests.(This last will he a matter for administrative action andnot legislation)-..-Paragraph The argument for this concession is that it will10 of ma-oority He-   benefit the poorest pensioners who&apos; are&apos;suffering greatport (p.9)   . , .  ,hardships at present&apos; and who&apos;; have the strongest claim ifmore money is to be spent on Old Age Pensions.x v  &apos;This is based on Sir A.Watson?s estimate that the averagepension under-tho new-scale will bo  24.7s,.0. per annum, i.e.about 9s.4d. a week, instead of  2,5&quot;.^StO. as estimated bySir ^Clarke-.    1,000,000 of the saving is. therefore due to areduction of the.original estimate of the cost of a doubledmeans limit.
2.   at the same time the existing poor Law dis-qualification will bo removed as regards outdoor reliefor the home assistance which will take its place uuder theparagraphs10 and 2o cf    recommendations of the Maclean committee.   This will enablemajorityreport. assistance to be given from local funds in cases ofspecial need and will obviate any necessity for furtherincreasing the amount of pension at the expense of theexchequer.   Pension will not however be paid to inmatesof poor law and other public institutions except that itmay be continued to persons entering such institutions inorder to obtain medical or surgical relief for a period notexceeding 3 months in order to prevent the breaking up ofthe home.3.   The means limit will, &amp;e aVrve stated run from 10s.to ISe. a week.   It is estimated that an additional savingof about  1,000,000 per annum would be obtained byreducing the scale so as to run from 8s. to 16s. but itis fe&apos;lt that a scale which makes it possible for pensioners&apos;, means to be brought up to the round sum of  1 a week is onewhioh will be so much more attractive and easily defensiblethat this additional expenditure is worth incurring.The new means limit will go a long way towardsmeeting the complaints of Friendly Societies and TradeUnions that the thrift of their members is &quot;penalized&quot;.As a rule the permanent sick pay or pension giver byfriendly Societies does not exceed f&apos;* a week.   TradeUnion pensions range from 4/- to 10/- but are almostalways nearer the lower figure.It can be said, therefore, that the reoeipt of theseC benefits will newer in the absence,of other means resultin the reduction of the Old Age pension.Moreover, as the Minority point out, when claimantsin receipt of such allowances are residiag with friendsor relations, these allowances-are usually paid over towards
)cost- of^^sirtr^unxiJU&amp;gi^^i^^within the limits required to qualify for full pension.The situation will he further eased &quot;by the proposedexclusion of temporary sick pay from the calculation ofmeans.The proposals of the Minority with regard to the calcu-lation of means (page 16 of the Report) should be adoptedas they stand.   The3e proposals are designed an the cne handto mitigate the grievances felt under the existing systemand on the other hand to limit the benefit which will beobtained by persons in possession of comparatively largecapital sums.These proposals cannot be clearly explained exceptin the terms of the report itself which are as follows&quot;There are contain   further modifications which werecommend should be made in the calculation of means.(l) The adoption of our proposal necessitates theimposition tf seme restriction on applicants possessedof considerable capital sums.   If no such restrictionwere imposed a single applicant would be eligiblefor the minimum pension if he possessed a capitalsum of x l,26o, or if he Were one of a marriedcouple, a sum of x 2,52o*   It seems to us that thegrant of a pension to such an applicant could notbe defended since it would enable him to preservehis capital intact, and the Tension would therebybenefit not the pensi&amp;ner hip/self but his successors.On the other hand, we are ir favour i.t a suggestionmade in evidence that small amounts deposited by theclaimants in the Post Office Savings Bank or retainedin the house should be ignored in calculating themeans,   guch sums are-frequently thus kept at handto serve for emergencies Cr for the payment of thefuneral expenses of the pensioner.   We think alsothat as the capital possessed by a pensioner increasesin amount a more stringent method of calculatingthe means from that source should be adopted.   Wetherefore suggest that the yearly value of invest-ments and Other property of the claimant whichmay be subject to an assessment on capital valueunder Section 2 (l) (a) of the Old Age PensionsAct,1911, should be calculated on a sliding scale asfollowsfaj The first  25 of capital value to be ignored.(b) The next  375 of capital value to be takenat 5 percent of such value.(cj) Any property in excess of  400 capitalvalue to be taken at 10 per cent asrepresenting roughly its annuity value.(Note.    With the lower means limit suggested these amountswill become  945 and  1,890 respectively).
9 n o6 SOby the Committee.(2)      Although we are in agreement with our oolleagues ,as to the difficulty of giving effect to the sug-gestions made in evidence in favour of the grant ofpreferential treatment to particular forms of pro-perty or inoome nevertheless we consider that anattempt might he made to remove some of the smallgrievances which have caused friction in the adminis-tration of the present scheme of old age pensions.Thus we consider that temporary sick pay or sickness.  benefit receivable by the applicant (or the husbandor wife of the applicant), under medical certificatefrom a friendly society, trade union, or under the-  National insurance Act, 1911, for a period notexceeding 3 months- in any period of 12 months afterthe allowance of a pension, should&apos;not be regardedas income.We consider that this exception is justifiable onthe ground that sickness in the house adds to theexpense of maintenance, hut we do not recommendthat the concession should cover permanent sick pay.This, in the case of the aged, is frequently in thenaMure of a pension, and is more often associatedwith the.disability resulting from old age itselfrather than with incapacity due to any specificc omplaint*-(3)      We believe that it is only in exceptional oircum-etances at present that furniture and personal effectsenter into the calculation of means.   In order toobviate irritation which may arise from an investi-gation into this item, we think It advisable toignore means from this source.(4) ,    There is one further point In which we considerthe existing Acts require amendment.   Where a-claimant is separated from his wife and an allowanceis. being paid to her by the claimant under aSeparation order, there is no provision enablingthe allowance to be deducted from the claimant&apos;smeans.   This involves the inclusion of the sum paidin the means of each of the couple and we considerthat in future it should not be included in themeans of the person actually making, the payment.&quot;4.   It is proposed to adopt the minor and miscellaneousrecommendations contained in paragraph 21 of the MajorityReport.   These cannot with clearness be more briefly summarisedand a copy of the paragraph in question is accordingly appendedbelow,   it should be noted that the recommendations with regardto nationality, imprisonment and failure to work may be acontroversial chaaraeter and it is open to doubt whether it isdesirable to reduce the period for which a claimant musthave been a British subject from 20 years to 10 as proposed
n32f.   in addition to our main-scheme &apos;*f reform there are&apos;c*eHMn minor points in which we-consider the existing Actsrequire am.endm.ent : -(1) statutory conditions for the receipt cf a pension :-!a)&apos; Nationality. - We do not feel able to supportthe recommendation made to us &quot;by the Board ofDeputies ef the British Jews that the nationalitytest should he waived in favour 8f a residencequ&amp;lification only.   Any privilege granted tounnaturalized aliens could only operate as a dis-cnaragement to naturalisation, and aliens in thecountry should take the full status cf citizen-ship if the authorities think them suitable.We think, however, that British subjects ofalien birth should become eligible for pension10 years (instead )f 20 years) after naturalisa-; tion, provided that they have been resident inthe United Kingdom for at least 2o years.If the position of the alien is to be furtherimproved,- we consider that this should beeffeoted by arranging reciprocity agreementswithin the League cf nations under which the vari-tUB nationals will became entitled to whateverform of old age pension is in force in theirowuntry vf settlement.We think that the arguments for the exclusion. 0f the alien do not apply with the same forcein the case of the British-born wife of an alien,and we recommend that, if the lav/ of nationalityremains as at present-, the benefits of thepension should be granted to her as- though shehad never lost her British nationality.W Residence. -   Section 3 (2) of the Act of 1911makes residence in the United Kingdom for 12. *utof the last 20 years a condition for the receiptof a pension.   The intention of this Sectionappears to be perfectly clear and we do not con-pider it unreasonable.   It is, however, sodrafted that if the period of absence occursnear the pensionable age, the date of eligibilitybecomes almost indefinitely postponed.   Thus aperson tf pensionable age who over the period*f 1900 to 1919 had been absent from the UnitedKingdom from 1910 to 1918 would have to waituntil 193d before he could receive a pension,whereas if he had been absent from 1900 to 1908he would become entitled in 1920.   We therefore- recommend that the section should be amendedto make the. period 12 years ih the aggregatesince attaining the age of 50.In this,connection our attention has beendrawn to the reciprocal agreement between theDominion of New Zealand and the Commonwealthof Australia with regard to residence, and wesuggest that legislative sanction be 3cught tegive effect to similar agreements between theUnited Kingdom and other parts cf the Empirewhere Old Age pensions are granted, so thatresidence in any one part shall count in any/3*her.T . it. &apos; m. -
tit t(2) statutory Disqualificationsm-fa) X^SXi.8^??^^ *   We d,G n0-t consider that the&apos; exLs-t   ^rr^quaTllfloations for varying terms afterthe completion of a sentence of impri so/me&quot;1&quot;-- can( be justified.   Suoh dl^u&amp;Juii^Aj-a-tion appeals tous to bo in the nature of a double punishment forthe same offence, which we consider to be wrongin principle.-Ajpart from this it is open io the furtherobjection that it works unevenly in differentcases.The judicial authority does hot invariably knowthat the prisoner is or is likely to become an oldage pensioner, and even where this is known theeffect of the sentence on the pension may not befully realised.   Again, it is unfair that anoffence which committed at the age of 59 involvesno penalty beyond the imprisonment itself, shouldat the age of 69 involve a los3 of pension inaddition.We therefore recommend the repeal of Sectionn3 (2) of the Act of 1908, and Section 4 (2) and(3) of the Act of 1911, so far as they involve die-qualification after the period of imprisonment,but we recommend the retention *f Section 3(3) of. the Act of 1908 in order to prevent payment of thepension to inebriates who are obviously unfittedto be trusted with the pension.(b) Failure to work. - We understand that this dis-. qualification is rarely operative; and we thinkthat it will be better frankly to abandon it.(c) The disqualification of inmates jf prisonsand pauper or criminal lunatic asylums should-continue as at present.(3) Miscellaneous Recommendationsa) Date Of reeeiving pension. - Under Section 52) of the Act of I9q9 a pension does not commenceh accrue until the first Friday after the claimhas been allowed by the Committee.   Similarly anincreased pension does not accrue until after thedecision by the Committee.Q-te. A claimant In many case3 delay has occurred between the% apply pr^- lodging of a claim and the payment of the pension,iaionally before      This delay is often unavoidable and in no wayttaining the reflects on the Pension Authorities) but the hard-It of 70* ship incurred is none the less real and we reeom-mend that each pension should date from the Fridayfollowing the receipt of the application for apension, or the date on which the person becomes: entitled to the pension, whichever is the later.
ITote^ There seemsTo&quot;&quot;he no reasonfor excludingthem unless theyare pauperlunatics.(h) Claims received on behalf of persons incapablesf understanding the.nature of the&quot;claim, &apos;^ Under&apos;&quot;&apos;TrTlTbld Age Pensions&apos;Acts there is no express dis-qualification of such persons, but the Law Officershave advised that claims made by persons mentallyincapable of understanding their significance could,,,net be regarded as 7aild, and the Acts as they nowstand make no provision for a claim to be made byether persons on their behalf..    e recommend that the cases cf persons qualifiedfor Old Age, Pensions (not certified as lunatics)but as a matter of fact incapable cf understandingthe nature of a claim, should be met by enablingpension Committees to entertain an application bya person prepared to aot as &quot;next priend&quot; whoseapplication is vouched for by a Magistrate, and isaccompanied by the certificate of a qualifiedmedical practitioner.(G)     inalienability of pension:,&quot;   Under Section 6cf the&quot;&quot;Act &quot;of 1$0Q&quot;, any charge &quot;&quot;on the pension isvoid, and in the event of the bankruptcy of apensioner it doss not pass for the benefit of thecreditors,We recommend that this provision should beextended and that the Old Age Pension be expresslyexcluded from the calculation of means for thepurpose of an instalment or a committal order underthe Debtors Act, thereby making the pensioninviolable against&apos;any creditors.&quot;5.    A machinery clause is also desirable to enable the Customstt increase an existing pension without having to refer.thecase to the ideal pension Committee, reserving of ourse theright of the pensioner to appeal to the Committee if he isdisaatisfied with the Pension officer&apos;a decision.. This willgreatly expedite matters,Nothing has been said in this memorandum as to therejected   proposal of the majority for univeral pensions,which is fully dealt with in the miner!ty report, or as tothe proposals of individual members for still furtherincreasing the amount of pension and for lowering the fuali-fying age.The latter is dealt with in paragraph 19 of the MajorityReport and it should be noted that they recommend a furtherenquiry into the Insurance Acts. It is almost certain, thatnothing will come of this, and no doubt the Government willnot wish to commit themselves to such an enquiry but it maybe difficult to refuse it.(intd.)
