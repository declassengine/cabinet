II.- Departmental.The Training of Unemployed Women.Under the original arrangements for the vocational training of women by the Ministryof Labour, provision was made for the period to expire in March, 1920. The Treasuryhave now authorised the continuation of this work until the 30th June, 1920.   lhis.(O 1938)  255  12/19  H &amp; 8 ^ $
extension lias been made in view of the fact that it will be impossible before that dateto complete many of the courses now in progress and to give training to women awaitingit. The extension of the period involves no additional expenditure beyond that for whichprovision was originally made. The training courses carried on by the Ministry have beensomething of a new departure, but reports from many districts indicate that publicattention and approval have now been secured. The department are being pressed inmany quarters to extend this work. A few examples of courses recently established willillustrate the scope of the Department&apos;s activities. The range of occupations nowcovered is wide. Various courses provide for instruction in tailoring, silver burnishing,shoe-closing, upholstering, dressmaking, embroidery, glove-iraking and other women&apos;soccupations.   The various sides of domestic work are also well represented.Many of the schemes instituted can accommodate only a comparatively small numberof women at a time, but others are of larger extent. Sanction has been given by theTreasury for renting, from the Ministry of Munitions, the Joan of Arc Hostel, Plumstead,for use as a training centre for women. This extension of facilities in the London areawill afford training ground for about 400 women, who are to be trained in dressmaking,laundry work, clerical work, ladies&apos; tailoring and cookery. The full accommodation willnot, however, be used immediately. It is proposed, to begin with, to provide equipmentfor 248 women. These women are now waiting to be trained and training for 163 willbe provided as soon as equipment can be installed. Attention may be directed to aspecial scheme for training in hosiery which has been successfully instituted at Falkirk.Here the number of unemployed women was considerable, while the normal occupationsin the district were few. Under &apos;these circumstances it was necessary to introduce a newindustry to the district. The West Lothian Hosiery Company suggested the establishmentof a local factory for the production of hosiery. Arrangements have been made for womento take a course of training for 15 weeks in the factory, after which they enter into theemployment of the firm. The usual maintenance grants are paid to the women while intraining, but the firm contribute a little over one-third of this amount in each case.The tailoring scheme at Leeds which has been in operation since Ma,y may be cited as oneof the most typical and successful of the Department^ operations.At Rotherham a wholesale clothing training scheme has been instituted, which alsoinvolves the introduction of an industry new to the district. The course started with250 trainees, but accommodation can ultimately be provided for about 1,000. The demandin the Huddersfield district alone will be sufficient to absorb all the workers who can betrained.A number of the centres established by the Ministry offer assistance in centres whichare not predominately industrial. Thus the dressmaking centre established at MountainAsh draws for the trainees on the coal-mining villages in the Rhondda Valley where thereis little factory employment for Avomen, but where dressmakers are in great demand toassist in the smaller workshops.The need for training in domestic work is hardly less marked than in women&apos;s industrialvocations, and the training courses of this kind established by the department have beenrecognised as carrying on excellent work. In a number of cases the women have beenengaged by employers while still under training, their work to be begun when the coursewas completed.   Several courses for children&apos;s nurses have been arranged.The number of schemes for training in progress on the 6th December was 84.Twelve other schemes which had been sanctioned had then already rim their full course,and five schemes sanctioned had not been put into operation. Accommodation hadbeen provided for some 4,800 trainees. On the 6th December 1,773 women were intraining and 421 women had completed their course. The department had thus beenresponsible for the training of some 2,200 unemployed women. The value of &quot;thiswork can only be estimated when it is remembered that women&apos;s employment even inrecognised women&apos;s processes has to some extent been affected by the question of wages.The prescribed or substituted rates laid down under the Wages (Temporary Regulation)Acts have in some&apos; districts led to the refusal of employers to accept adult learnersand even to the dismissal of the less skilled among the women already employed. Underthese circumstances it is obvious that prospects of employment must in many instancesdepend upon the provision of adequate training.A branch of women&apos;s training with which the department have not long been asso-ciated is that which provides for the training of the widows and dependants of officersand men killed in the war. A steady flow of applications for training is still occurring.The total number of applications received to date is 1,662 and in 685 cases training has beensanctioned. At present 207 persons are under training, and 322 have already completedtheir training.
Part TIL Press Comments. -(1) The Labour and Socialist Press.Coal Industry.The reduction in the price of coal supplied for domestic consumption is discussedthis week in the light of the debate in the House of Commons on Friday, the 28thNovember.   Mr. P. W. Jowett, in the &quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; expresses the opinion thatthe debate fully justified the demand of the Labour Party for a committee of inquiryinto the whole of the operations of the Coal Controllers Department, and adds that suchan inquiry would undoubtedly support the case of the miners for nationalisation.  Mr.Jowett anticipates that the reduction will result in some mines stopping work, and pointsout that under nationalisation no such thing would happen.   The loss incurred in thosemines producing coal mainly for domestic consumption, would, he thinks, undernationalisation be set off against the profit realised in other mines producing for export.Mr. T. Kennedy discusses the question in &quot; Justice,&quot; and suggests that the President ofthe Board of Trade should place the Coal Controllers Department on a sound businessbasis, but puts forward the view that such an action cannot be expected of the presentGovernment.  Mr. Kennedy believes that the Government will &quot; encourage waste anddevelop chaos in order to prejudice the case for the nationalisation and socialisation ofour industries.&quot;   An article in the &quot; Democrat&quot; was noted last week in which it wasurged that it would have been wiser to reduce the price of all coal by a small sum thanto reduce strictly domestic coal by so large an amount.   The opinion of the &quot; Democrat &quot;is rarely a popular one. and this particular line of attack upon Government policy has notbeen adopted by any other Labour or Socialist journal.   The &quot; New Age,&quot; indeed, cordiallyapproves, in principle, of the preference shown by the Government for the householdconsumer.   This paper, however, then proceeds to. put Mr. Jowetfs argument in moregeneral terms and concludes that, from the present moment, the output of coal will beginto decline.   Such a result as this, thinks the &quot; New Age,&quot; may well hasten the advent ofnationalisation.   Then follows a categorical denial of the claims of the advocates ofnationalisation, and the conclusion is arrived at that nationalisation &quot; is a desperatealternative to the existing system.&quot;   &quot; Nationalisation, in the form demanded by theminers&apos; leaders, would split the country into mutually hateful pieces.&quot;   The &quot; NewAge &quot; announces that the only alternative is now on its way to America to be laid beforethe American railwaymen and miners, but gives no hint as to the positive terms ofits proposal.    These are known, however, to a considerable number of persons.The &quot; Labour Pioneer &quot;* approves of the action of the M.F.G.B. in withdrawingtheir representatives from the Advisory Committee to the Coal Controller and invites thetrade union representatives on the Wool Council to adopt a similar attitude.Housing.The shortage of houses is dealt with in a long article in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; byMr. A. Gordon Cameron (secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters andJoiners). Mr. Cameron&apos;s first point is that this shortage was already acute before the war,when the private enterprise of the speculative builder had full opportunity. Beforethe war he thinks that the fault lay in the failure of local authorities to perform theirduties, but now he insists that the housing question is national in every respect and thatthe Government must assume full responsibility. He complains that thousands of buildingoperatives are still in the army, and calls upon the Government to commandeer allbuilding materials, control all building operations, and use the municipalities. In viewof the Norwich experiment,! it is remarkable that Mr. Cameron does not discuss anyscheme for the direct participation of the building trade unions in the business of providing,houses. He fears the subsidy will merely swell the profits of the builders&apos; merchant,,and wishes to eliminate the speculative builder, but does not differentiate the manymethods a local authority may employ in the execution of a housing scheme. The&quot; Democrat&quot; this week is more critical than it was last week of the proposed subsidy,and suggests that the subsidy should be applied directly in relief of rent by being madeavailable only when a house is actually built and occupied by a class of tenant unable to-pay an &quot; economic rent.&quot;. * This ne.w name has been assumed, by the &quot; Yorkshire Factory Times.&quot;f The building of 32 houses is to be undertaken by the local branches of the Building Trades&apos; Federation,,under supervision of the City Engineer.(C 1938)3S2
Prices and Profiteering.The deep interest of the Labour movement in these allied questions was remarkedupon last week. There is little, however, that is new in the discussions in this week&apos;spress. The &quot; British Citizen &quot; continues to give great prominence to Mr. J. Terrettfscomplaints against the administration of the Profiteering Act. The &quot; Clarion &quot; entersinto an apology for the Ministry of Food and an argument for its continuance. Itcriticises the Ministry, indeed, for its handling of milk, butter and meat, but urges thatthe remedy lies in &quot; gingering up the Food Ministry &quot; rather than in abolishing it. Asimilar attitude is adopted by Mr. H. M. Hyndman in &quot; Justice.&quot; The &quot; Workers&apos; Dread-nought &quot; which is always reckless in its criticism of the Government complains of the&quot;profiteering&quot; of the Ministry of Food. Mr. J. Maclean discusses the currency questionin &quot; The Call&quot; in continuation of his article last week. He acknowledges that we haveno control of world movements in prices, but he thinks that one of the domestic causesof high prices can be removed. Mr. Maclean believes that the root domestic cause is theinflation of currency by means of Treasury notes, but his only suggestion for the removalof this inflation is that Treasury notes should all be burnt.*The &quot; New Age &quot; discusses the debate in the House of Lords initiated by LordD&apos;Abernon.   Viscount Peel&apos;s reply on behalf of the Government is severely criticised,&apos;and this paper reiterates its conviction that &quot; the expansion of credit arising from theincreased production of luxuries has the same effect upon cash in relation to necessitiesas the expansion of credit for shells.&quot;Unemployment.The discussion arising out of the stopping of the out-of-work donation is continued thisweek but takes a more constructive form. The &quot;New Statesman,&quot; the &quot;Democrat&quot;and the &quot; Socialist&quot; all discuss the means hy which unemployment might be insuredagainst or else prevented. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; devotes a special article to the question,and argues that though, from a statistical point of view, the existing amount of unemploy-ment is by no means abnormal, these statistical calculations have lost much of their value,because during and in consequence of the war &quot; the workers have got out of the habit of-acquiescing in periodical unemployment as a precept of the law of nature.&quot; &quot; The&apos; permanent hypothesis &apos; of unemployment has been largely destroyed,&quot; and the demandnow is not for insurance against unemployment, but for regular work under standardconditions of employment. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; is in full sympathy with this demandand maintains that there is no reason why society should acquiesce in the waste of itsproductive resources involved in the maintenance of &quot; reserves of labour.&quot; One remedythis paper propounds is that the State and municipalities should so regulate their policyas to make their demand for Labour vary inversely with the general demand. It isrecognised that such a regulation, would not by itself be a sufficient solution, and the secondproposal of the &quot; New Statesman &quot; is that a system of universal and. compulsory insuranceagainst unemployment should be devised so as to put the cost of unemployment uponthe particular industries responsible. In this way a direct financial incentive would beprovided to each industry for the most economic and complete utilisation of all the labouremployed in it. The &quot; Democrat &quot; discusses the matter upon slightly different lines,but arrives at a conclusion substantially similar. The &quot; Socialist&quot; discusses the matteron much the same lines as last week. The theory is advanced that it is practicable tomeet the unemployment question by an adjustment of the working day in each industryso as to absorb all the unemployed workers.International Labour Conference.There has been remarkably little comment upon the proceedings of the WashingtonConference in the Labour and Socialist Press. This probably has been due to the somewhatscanty reports that have appeared in the English daily press on the subject. This week,however, the &quot; Cotton Factory Times,&quot; &quot; Rob Roy &quot; in &quot; Forward &quot; and the &quot; BritishCitizen &quot; devote a certain amount of space to the subject. The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot;emphasises its opinion that no previous international gathering of the kind can comparein importance with the one just concluded. By the institution of this Conference it believesthat a new era has been opened out for Labour. The fear of foreign competition, thinksthis paper, will soon lose its force as a reason for declining to respond to the call for progressand reform.  The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; then proceeds to review the work achieved* It may be noted that Sir Oswald Stoll, in the &quot; Daily News &quot; 9th inst., made a similar attack onTreasury notes, and shares, with a number of other prominent individuals, Mr. Maclean&apos;s erroneous beliefthat their eradication would solve the problem of high prices.
by the Conference. Particular attention is paid to the hours&apos; question, which is of peculiarinterest at present to the Cotton Industry. Both the &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; and&quot; Rob Roy &quot; refer to the question of Indian factory conditions, and point out that onecannot criticise conditions in Japan which are prevalent also in India. The &quot; BritishCitizen &quot; catalogues the recommendations of the Conference and. congratulates Mr. G. N.Barnes on the services he has rendered to it.Co-partnership. . .The situation that has arisen at Port Sunlight, by the threat of the National Associationof Carpenters and Joiners to expel any of their members who continue to participatein the Co-partnership Scheme established by Messrs. Lever Bros., Ltd., receives attentionin the &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; (28th ult.) and &quot; Justice &quot; (4th inst.). In view of thesuspicion Avith which profit-sharing schemes are usually regarded in trade union circles,it is noteworthy that the &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; insists that participation in Co-partner-ship Schemes is a matter for the individual worker to decide upon and not for the tradeunion. This paper professes to understand the preference for time rates as against piecerates, the objection of the carpenters to which is at the bottom of their hostility toCo-partnership, but maintains that this question of piece or time rates is not the &quot; acidtest of trade union principle.&quot; The journal concludes that in this case it would seem thatthe threat of expulsion is very far from being justifiable. &quot; Justice,&quot; however, supportsthe attitude of the Carpenters&apos; Union. &quot; The more sternly the trade unions set themselvesagainst all these Co-partnership Schemes, the better it will be for the organised working-class movement.&quot;The Labour Movement.A manifesto from Mr. David Ramsay on behalf of the Workers&apos; Committee Movementhas been recently appearing in many of these papers. The main point of the manifestois strong dissent from the proposals to establish a Labour &quot; General Staff,&quot; and an advocacyof a new orientation of the active trade union movement round industrial groups as opposedto residential groups. . This manifesto inspires two articles this week in the &quot; MerthyrPioneer &quot; and the &quot; Socialist.&quot; Mr. J. T. Murphy in the former paper criticises the schemeat present being considered for the application of the general Whitley principles to mostindustries, and a particular form of them to the mines, railways and the building industry.He maintains that in reality these schemes will result in a combination of capitalists andtrade union leaders for the exploitation, of the working classes. In order to challengethis movement he calls for the organisation of active rank and file committees. In the&quot; Socialist &quot; Mr. McManus deals more particularly with the problems confronting thesuccessful Labour candidates at municipal elections. They are, he says, in search of aprogramme. He fears that they will be led to adopt a programme of bureaucratic StateSocialism, and implores them not to add to the difficulties confronting revolutionarysocialism by setting up a bureaucratic despotism as an additional obstacle in the pathof revolution.Viscountess Astor&apos;s return to Parliament is referred to by Mr. F. W. Jowett in the&quot; Merthyr Pioneer &quot; and by the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; in a leading article. In each casethe wish is expressed that the honour of being the first woman to take a seat in the Houseof Commons had fallen to someone more worthy, and it is insisted that the Labour Partymust not allow Lady Astor to remain as the sole representative in the House of Commons,of tHe enfranchised women. Mr. J. H. Thomas&apos;s action in endeavouring to introducea Peerage Surrender Bill into the House of Commons is criticised in &quot; The Call &quot; and the&quot; Labour Pioneer.&quot;(2) Ex-Service Men&apos;s Periodicals.Nil.Part IV.-General Topics.The General Situation.The week has been an eventful one. The great issues of the moment in the labourworld, comprising nationalisation, the cost of living, imemployment, Russia, and the re-organisation of the central authority in the Labour Movement, were all brought before
the Special Trades Union Congress, and if no vital decisions were made, the attitude of&apos;Labour on certain matters was clearly denned.  The new National Labour Campaignfor the nationalisation of the mines has been inaugurated, and will continue for two orthree months.   The Industrial Court has begun its sessions, and an official announcementof the new scheme for the control of the railways has been made.The Trades Union Congress.The origin and purpose of the Special Congress held in London on the 9th and10th inst. and the development of the problems with which it was concerned were dealtwith in last week&apos;s Report, and need not now be recapitulated. It may at once be saidthat this meeting was far inferior, in interest and importance, to the Glasgow Congress.There was no real debate on any of the resolutions, except for the discussion on theproposal for the formation of a T.U.C. General Council, and Mr. John Ward&apos;s Elijah-likeintervention on the Eussian question. The Congress moved throughout on thoroughlyconstitutional lines, &quot; direct action &quot; hardly dared to raise its head., and almost the onlyminatory utterances were those of Mr. Tom Mann. This is not to say that the Congressshowed any weakening of determination on any of the issues which it met to consider.On the contrary it is clear that on some of them, notably Russia, its mind is obsessed byan idee fixe, which no amount of argument could remove. But the Congress had no desireto take immediate extreme measures to make its convictions effective ; and until theCongress to be held in February, 1920, its representatives will proceed on all issues by wayof the constitutional methods of deputation and propaganda.On the 9th inst. the two items on the agenda were the nationalisation of the minesand the cost of living. On the first, Mr. J. H. Thomas, who was chairman of the Congress,pointed out that the question was not one for the decision of any one section or class ofthe community, but must be determined in the interests of the community as a whole..He urged the Congress not to forget the political side of their movement which, was aninstrument that could be as powerful as was industrial action, inasmuch as it was not SO&apos;costly, and certainly less inconvenient, to secure by the ballot box that for which menwere prepared to strike. Mr. Frank Hodges gave an account of the arrangements madefor the &quot; Campaign of intensified propaganda,&quot; to be undertaken jointly by the LabourParty, the Parliamentary Committee, the M.F.G.B. and the Co-operative Party, whichwill involve over 100 big demonstrations in all important centres of the country in thenext two or three months. The resolution* deferring action under the Glasgow resolution.until the February Congress was proposed by Mr. W. Thorne, seconded by Mr. W. Brace,and supported by Mr. Tom Mann, Mr. Jack Jones, and Mr. Robert Smillie. Mr. TomMann declared that if the Government turned down the demand, something of a definiteand practical kind would be required, something covered by the term &quot; industrial action,&quot;and not always by the term &quot; constitutional.&quot; It was not the miners alone who requiredcontrol of their industry, nor transport alone. Each trade would come along with its.programme, until the general principle of socialisation had been effectively applied-Mr. Smillie apologised for the necessity of postponing action, but he made it clear thathe intended that the next Congress should authorise definite action. Such action wouldbe constitutional, he maintained, because the great trades union movement was perfectlyentitled to force the Government on a question of that kind. The resolution was,unanimously carried.The discussion on the cost of living was of little importance. The resolution! on thesubject was moved by Mr. A. A. Purcell. Mr. Frank Hodges proposed an addendumwhich attempted to give point to the resolution by instructing the Parliamentary Com-mittee to demand from the Government the acceptance of certain &quot; remedial measures &quot;proposed in a memorandum prepared by the M.F.G.B. This lengthy document proposes,the control of raw materials, the introduction of fresh subsidies, and the removal of dutieson certain articles of food. The Chairman apparently realised the intellectual povertyof the memorandum, for he felt constrained to explain that the proposals were put forwardmerely as a contribution to the solution of the problem. The resolution, with theaddendum, was accepted unanimously.On the 10th inst. Mr. J. H. Thomas reported on the interview of the ParliamentaryCommittee with the Prime Minister on the 8th inst. with regard to unemployment benefit,Russia, conscription, and the reinstatement of the police. Two emergency resolutions-framed by the Parliamentary Committee as a result of this interview were unanimouslycarried. The first of these resolutions, strongly condemning the Government for theirwithdrawal of &quot; Civil Unemployment Benefit &quot; without making any alternative provision.* This resolution was given in last week&apos;s Report, pages 453 and 454.t This resolution was given in last week&apos;s Report, page 454.
for unemployed persons, and demanding that effective steps shall be taken to either findemployment or maintenace for all those affected by the Governments decision, was proposedby Mr. J. K. Clynes and seconded by Mr. J. Mills. The second resolution called on theGovernment to consider the peace overtures made by the Soviet Government, and toraise the blockade, and instructed the Parliamentary Committee to demand passportsto enable a special delegation to visit Russia to make an independent and impartial inquiryinto the political, industrial, and economic conditons there. This was moved by Mr. JohnHill, seconded by Mr. Robert Williams and supported by Mr. Tom Mann and others.Mr. John Ward then claimed the right to speak, and for a short period the Congress gave anamazing exhibition of passionate intolerance. The members had just applauded to the echoMr. Tom Mann, though he explicitly stated that he did not speak for the whole of hisUnion, and, had it not been for the strong sense of fair play of the chairman, they would haverefused a hearing to Mr. Ward on the ground that his views did not represent the wholeof his Union. Mr. Ward&apos;s arguments, which were not remarkably good, made no impressionon the Congress, and the resolution was carried unanimously.An interesting discussion took place on the resolution* for the establishment of aT.U.C. General Council. It was proposed by Mr. Harry Gosling and seconded by Mr. R.Williams, but was opposed by Mr. J. Bromley and Mr. Frank Hodges. Mr. Bromleyargued that they might set up a body which would step in to close a strike, and advocateda fighting central council. He feared that the new body would repeat the defects of theold Parliamentary Committee. Mr. Frank Hodges objected to the scheme on behalf ofthe M.F.G.B. He maintained, on conservative grounds, that there was no evidence of thedesirability of the new proposals, since all the effective steps which they included werealready within the power of the Parliamentary Committee to carry out, without anyconstitutional change, and, on extremist grounds, that the introduction of the trade unionside of the National Industrial Conference was utterlv distasteful to the M.F.G.B., &quot;whichhad no use for an organisation representing employers and employed.&quot; In a passionatedefence of the proposals, however, Mr. Bevin evidently carried the Congress with him.He alluded with indignation to the fact that the less strongly organised workpeople hadhad recently to appeal to the Minister of Labour not to give way to the strong Unionsover the Industrial Courts Bill; and to the fact that in calling the Industrial Conference,the Minister had asked for three representatives only from the Parliamentary Committee,while joint industrial councils that were of no importance were well represented, and hisown Union, unknown to its official leaders, had 16 representatives present. These facts,he contended, showed hoAV badly a really representative body was needed. After furtherdiscussion the motion to refer the resolution back was defeated by 2,884,000 votes to1,722,000; and the original resolution was then carried by a large majority. Therecommendations of the Parliamentary Committee in accordance with this resolutionwill be considered at&apos; the special Congress in February.A statement on the Moulders&apos; Strdce was made by Mr. J. E. Davison, and the Chairmansaid the Parliamentary Committee would, do all it could to bring about an early conferencebetween the parties concerned. &apos;Industrial Court.In pursuance of the Industrial Courts Act; the Minister has appointed the followingto be the first members of the Standing Industrial Court: President Sir WilliamMacKenzie, K.C., K.B.E.; Chairman-Mr. F. H. McLeod, C.B. ; Members-Messrs.D. C. Cummings, C.B.E., J. McKie Bryce, E. J. Brown, F. S. Button, Miss Violet Markham.(Mrs. James Carruthers), and Miss Cecilie Matheson. The Secretary of the CourtisMr. G. T. Reid.  If it should be found necessary other chairmen and members would be. available to form additional divisions of the Industrial Court. Panels of persons avail-able to act as single arbitrators and as chairmen and members of ad hoc Courts of Arbitra-tion will be constituted by the Minister, and the services of the various ArbitrationTribunals will be available where these are required.The Court sat for the first time on the 8th inst. So far, over 60 cases have beenreferred to it for determination.Forty-Eight Hour Bill.The further progress in the House of the Forty-Eight Hour Bill is postponed till&apos;. after Christmas.   The Conference of representatives of various organisations of employersand workers in agriculture, which met on the 24th November Avith a view to discoveringsome method of surmounting the difficulties in connection with the exclusion of* This resolution was given in last week&apos;s Keport, page 454.
agriculture from the Forty-Eight Hour Bill, and was then adjourned, met again on the8th inst., but it proved impossible to overcome the difficulty with regard to the constitution,of the employers&apos; side of the Conference. The workers&apos; representatives objected stronglyto the inclusion on the employers&apos; side of bodies whose members include land owners,surveyors and others whose claim to be regarded as employers of agricultural labour isdisputed. It was not found possible for a joint discussion to take place on the questionof the relation of agriculture to the Bill, and the Conference was again adjourned. It isreported that on the 4th inst. a meeting of representatives of the Seafarers&apos; Joint Councildecided to undertake a campaign in all the big seaports in the United Kingdom, in further-ance of their demands that all seafarers, including officers, should be included in thisBill.The Nationalisation of the M.ines.In addition to the unofficial campaign in South Wales against the nationalisationof the mines conducted by conservative elements within the Miners&apos; Federation, anaccount of which was given in last week&apos;s Report, it may be noted that there is anotherunofficial movement of a different kind in existence in South Wales. This is the Syndi-calist movement which is reported to have a large following in the South Wales area.The Sjmdicalists are, of course, against the nationalisation of the mines on the groundthat it is incompatible with the conduct of the industry on the principle of &quot; The Minesfor the Miners.&quot; Neither of these unofficial campaigns, however, appears to be of ve^great importance, and the great body of miners in South Wales will certainly be loyalto the programme of the M.F.G.B.The Parliamentary Committee of the T.U.C., the Labour Party Executive, and theexecutive of the M.F.G.B., met on the 8th inst, to consider their plans for the newnationalisation campaign. The first meeting of this campaign was held in London onthe 8th inst., and was addressed by Mr. Henderson, Mr. Smillie, and others.Railway Control.The arrangements finally arrived at between the railway unions and the Government,details of which were announced by the Minister of Transport on the 8th December,involve one or two alterations in the scheme which was mentioned in this Report for theweek ending 19th November, as being then under discussion. The machinery which hasbeen agreed upon is as follows : (1) A Central Board, consisting of five railway managersand five representatives of the trade unions, the latter being composed as to three fromthe N.U.R. and two from the A.S.L.E. &amp; F., with power to each side to add a sixth member.This Board will deal with questions of wages and conditions of service apart from thepresent negotiations. (2) Failing agreement by this Central Board, matters in disputein connection with wages and conditions of service will be referred to a National WagesBoard, consisting of four railway managers, four railway workers and four users of railways.Of the four railway users&apos; representatives, one shall be nominated by the ParliamentaryCommittee of the T.U.C., one by the Co-operative Union, one by the Federation of BritishIndustries, after consultation with other industrial organisations, and one by the AssociatedChamber of Commerce after similar consultation, with an independent chairman appointedby the Government. It has been agreed by the unions concerned that no strike shalltake place on account of a dispute arising on these matters until one month after thequestion in dispute has been referred to the National Wages Board. (3) Local committeesto which matters of local importance are to be referred will be set up. (4) An AdvisoryCommittee will take the place of the Railway Executive Committee, this to consist of.twelve General Managers and. four representatives of the workers. The workers&apos; repre-sentatives are Mr. J. H. Thomas and Mr. C. T. Cramp of the N.U.R., Mr. J. Bromley,A.S.L.E. &amp; F., and Mr. A. G. Walkden, R.C.A.The negotiations with regard to the standardisation of wages continue.With reference to the persistent rumours which are rife in all parts of the countrythat a railway strike is threatened to take place about Christmas time, Mr. J. H. Thomason the 5th inst. deprecated the spreading of such rumours, but he admitted that up to thepresent the Government^ offer with regard to wages had not been such as could be acceptedby the N.U.R. It should be noted, however, that Mr. Thomas&apos;s statement was madebefore the further negotiations which have since been taking place, and the prospects, ofsettlement are now believed to have been improved.Trade Unionism and the Co-operative Movement. As a result of discussions betweenrepresentatives of the Labour Party, the Trades Union Congress and the Co-operativeMovement, a Joint Committee has been appointed to arrange for combined action by the-
fbodies concerned if and when necessary. Mr. J. H. Thomas is Chairman of this Committeeand Mr. E. Perry of the Co-operative Movement is Secretary. A conference was alsoheld recently at Glasgow to discuss the help that might be given by the Co-operativeWholesale Society in the banking of funds. It is reported that the number of trade unionaccounts with the Co-operative Bank has increased this year from 842 to 1,103, and thatthe total deposit approaches two millions. In the Newcastle area it is stated that thereis a general agreement that co-operators shall give support to the Trade Union Movementby supplying food stuffs, but where arrangements for this cannot be made, the Co-operativeWholesale Society&apos;s Bank is willing to give credit to the extent of  2 per member of eachunion for supplies obtained from local Co-operative Stores. Mr. Tom Mann, speakingat Coventry on the 23rd November, urged his hearers all to become co-operators, asduring a big strike the Co-operative Movement could be used for feeding their wives andchildren. A. special Labour and Co-operative Week organised by the Woolwich TradesCouncil and the Education Committee of the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society is takingplace this week.The &quot; Daily Herald.&quot; The &quot; Daily Herald &quot; is giving much publicity to its financialposition and needs. The Special Trade Union Committee, consisting of Messrs. Henderson,Hodges, W. C. Robinson, Thomas, Turner and Bevin, appointed to assist the develop-ment of the paper, recently issued a statement addressed to the executive officers andmembers of the Trade Union Movement, urging the Executives of the various tradesunions to take up debenture stock to the extent of  400,000. This will bear interest at5 per cent, per annum, guaranteed for five years. It is estimated that of this sum of 400,000,  325,000 would be spent on the London and Manchester editions (when the latteris started) in three years&apos; time, after which there is every prospect of the paper paying. It isannounced that the Executive Cjmmittee of the N.U.R. have decided to invest a sum of 10,000 in this stock, but, so far, apart from this, large subscriptions have not yet beenreceived, and. it seems very unlikely that, in the present strained position of trade unionfinances referred to in another paragraph in this Report, the &quot; Herald &quot; will succeed inplacing its  400,000 of stock. With a view to raising immediate funds, the paper proposesto conduct a campaign during the week ending December 19th in support of itself, and tomake an organised collection of Christmas boxes for this purpose.Russia. On the 7th inst. a Conference was held in London of &quot; Hands off Russia &quot;Committees. A permanent committee for the London area was elected and a resolutionwas passed demanding a Special Joint Conference of the T.U.C. and the Labour Party,to consider the Russian situation. It was further resolved that if this Joint Conferenceshould not take place, a meeting of &quot; Hands off Russia &quot; Committees should be held, todecide the best methods of direct action. Little importance need be attached to thecampaign of these committees., The Duration of Wage Agreements. A feature of the unsettled conditions which haveensued on the termination of the war has been the extremely limited duration of wageagreements between employers and workpeople. Before the war agreements betweenemployers and workers usually provided that the rate of wages established should bemaintained for not less than a year, and frequently for a longer period than that. Suchagreements were rendered possible by stable conditions of trade, with relatively fixedprices for the products of industry, and a relatively constant level of the cost of living.At the Armistice the future level both of prices of manufactured goods and of the costof living was uncertain, but in order to secure to labour the stabilisation of the high ratesof wages then existing the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act was passed. In importantgroups of trades, however, agreements had been made in February, 1917, for a four-monthly review of wages, and the Interim Court of Arbitration took the place of the-.Committee on Production in considering the claim made under these agreements every-four months. And in trades in which no such agreements for periodic review have been-,made, a feature of the past year has been the constant series of claims and counter-claims^in connection with wage increases.The effect of frequent changes and applications for changes in rates of wages is two-fold. In the first place, industry is seriously handicapped by the uncertainty which mustprevail when rates of wages are changed at short intervals. In many branches of tradeemployers are obliged when quoting prices to attach a condition providing for variation ,in the event of changes taking place in the rates of wages before the order is executed. Asa result, contracts are sometimes withheld, postponed, or diverted abroad, and employ-ment is adversely affected.In the second place, the constant raising of money-wages, so far from producing con-tentment in the ranks of labour, gives rise to increasing dissatisfaction and unrest. Thecauses of this are in the main two.  So long as the rise in the cost of living continues, no(C 1938) 3 T
award of increased wages can be regarded as final. The rise in prices, as was pointed outin this Report, page 196, automatically dislocates every industrial settlement. Further,during the war the normal relations between different grades and classes of workers, asexpressed in wages, have been seriously dislocated, and as a result whole classes of workersfeel intense dissatisfaction, not only absolutely, i.e., dissatisfaction with regard to thestatus and remuneration of labour as such, but also relatively, i.e., dissatisfaction withtheir own particular level of wages in comparison with some other class or grade whosewages appear to have been raised disproportionately.It is clear that it is extremely desirable that, as early as possible, agreements havingvalidity for an extended period should be brought into operation in the various industriesand trades. It is equally clear that under present conditions, when future variations inthe cost of living cannot be accurately forecasted, it is exceedingly difficult to obtain suchagreements, unless the cost of living is included as an internal factor within the principleon which the wage-agreement is based, or, in other words, unless the agreement providesthat wages shall be adjusted automatically in some agreed proportion in accordance withthe fluctuation in the cost of living. Agreements of this type, it may be remembered, haverecently been made in the Textile Bleaching, Dyeing and Finishing Trades, in the Woollenand Worsted Industry (West Riding), Machine Calico Printing, Worsted and Lambs woolSpinning (Leicester), and Asbestos Manufacture. In most cases the agreements weremade for a year.It may be mentioned that in the agreement on the future scales of salaries of teachersin public elementary schools, which has been reached by the Standing Joint Committeerepresenting associations of local education authorities and the National Union of Teachers,the N.U.T. agrees not to press for or countenance any pressure for increases in salaries forperiods varying from two years to four years, according to the conditions in differentdistricts.Trade Union Finances. For some months past it has been clear from reports invarious Trade Union journals that the present time is a critical one for Trade Unionfinances. Although, during the war, owing to the absence of strikes and unemployment,many unions built up large reserve funds, in the case of some unions these have in recentmonths been seriously depleted by continued disputes. Further, what may be termednormal trade union expenditure has either already largely increased, or must soon do so,for the decrease in the purchasing power of money renders inadequate the scale of benefitin force before the war. Some Unions, among them the N.U.R., have recently increasedthe rate of some of their benefits. Again, the cost of management has largely increased,due in great measure to the increased salaries which the rise in the cost of living hascompelled Unions to grant to their officials. This is a serious matter for many Unions,because, even before the war, certain Unions spent a very large proportion of their totalexpenditure on management. Thus, in 1913, the N.U.R. is stated to have spent 62.4 percent, of its total expenditure on management, the National Union of General Workers61.3 per cent., and the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union 74.3 percent.Many Unions have already decided to raise their rates of subscription, and manymore are considering the advisability of it. But the raising of subscriptions is not popular,and Unions will not do it until they are compelled by events. Trade Unions cannot, ofcourse, place their benefits, or at least the greater part of them, on an. actuarial basis.Such benefits as sick and superannuation can be forecasted, but unemployment benefitand strike benefit depend on external factors which cannot be calculated in advance.And it is significant that the General Federation of Trade Unions, whose chief raison d-etrenow is to act as a strike insurance society, to which Trade Unions pay contributions at afixed rate and from which they are entitled to a fixed rate of benefit in. return, indicatesin its last quarterly balance-sheet that it is in financial difficulties. It there states : &quot; The financial position of the General Federation will need to be carefully consideredin the near future. In order that an effective reserve may be accumulated, it is essentialthat the present rates of contributions in proportion to the benefits paid should be revised,if only temporarily. The tremendous risks of lengthy disputes at the present day, andfor some time to come, will test the weak links in the Federation rules; and we mustrise to the occasion and strengthen the structure that it may endure the passing storm.The present fees do not seem adequate for the liability maintained. It takes two anda half years to accumulate sufficient funds to pay one week&apos;s benefit in the event of a,dispute.&quot; It may be mentioned that the G.F.T.U. was forced, some years ago, to reviseits scale of befiefits owing to the financial unsoundness in which it was involved. It maybe expected that the whole question of Trade Union finance will be one of the first whichthe new T.U.C. General Council will consider.
The Tinplate Trade. The unofficial movement of picklers and barcutters in theTinplate Trade, although it lasted only a few days, forced several thousand men intoidleness. Conditions in the Tinplate Trade have, during the past year, been very difficultand troubled. The difficulties have been almost entirely due to a very active and strenuousunconstitutional section of the workers. The unofficial movement in this trade is a newdevelopment. The trade is highly organised, and the employees are fully in the confidenceof the employers. For 20 years a very efficient Conciliation Board existed for the industry,and early in the present year a Joint Industrial Council was formed, by which amicablenegotiation has been still further encouraged. On this Council, the employers&apos; andworkmen&apos;s representatives work together most harmoniously, but since early in theyear there has been growing evidence of a desire on the part of the rank and file to actindependently of, and frequently in opposition to, the policy advocated by their accreditedunion leaders. The leaders of this unofficial movement, it is reported, are actively asso-ciated with the school of thought represented by the Central Labour College, and pro-pagated by the Pleb League Classes, which have been established in most of the largeindustrial centres in South Wales. In June and July, workers in several districts repu-diated an agreement reached on the Joint Industrial Council, and unofficial DelegateMeetings urged their leaders to withdraw from the J.I.C. and to seek union with theTriple Alliance. (An account of the negotiations at this period was given in this Report,page 76.) This movement, although causing considerable dislocation in the industry,was not successful, but further unofficial delegate conferences have been held and resolu-tions passed advocating, if necessary general strikes to secure the abolition of contributionsunder the National Insurance Act, and the increase of the Income Tax Abatement. It isreported that the Trade Union officials are apprehensive that this rank and file movementmay cause a series of unofficial strikes in the early months of the New Year.Rate of Unemployment. In view of the statements and suggestions which haverecently been made, even in quarters which are generally well-informed, that the presentrate of unemployment is high, it seems necessary to point out that, in comparison withthe pre-war level of unemployment, the present rate is distinctly low. It is not intendedby this to suggest that the problem of unemployment is not an urgent one, or to minimisethe importance of non-statistical factors which must be taken into account if any com-parison with pre-war years is to be of value. Statements are often made, however,which suggest that a statistical comparison shows the present rate to be high, and thisis not in accordance with the facts.The only possible standard of comparison over a long period of years is providedby the returns made by various Trade Unions which pay unemployed benefit to theirmembers. These returns are supplied by various unions in the following industries : Building, Coal Mining, Metal, Engineering and Shipbuilding, Textiles, Clothing, Paper,Printing and Bookbinding, Woodworking, Pottery, Glass, Leather and Tobacco. The&quot;basis of this standard of comparison is, on the whole, sound, but it must be rememberedthat certain changes take place in the unions making returns, and that there are otherfactors which tend to affect the value of the comparison. The general percentage forall unions included in these returns over a period of ten years before the war was asfollows : 1904 ..	6.0	1909	.7.71905 ..	5.0	1910   ..	4.71906 ..	3.6	1911   ..	3.01907 ..	3.7	1912   ..	3.21908 ..	7.8	1913   ..	2.1These figures give a mean of 4.7 per cent, for the period 1904-1913.The present rate of unemployment is very much less than this. The percentages,,for the last six months for which figures are available, are as follows : May ..      ..      ..       2.1 August        ..      ..       2.2June ..      ..       1.7 September    ..      ..       1.6July ..      ..      &apos;..       2.0 October       ..      ..       2.aThese figures give a mean of 2 per cent, for the last six months.With this may be compared the percentage of the total number of civilian and H.M.Forces out-of-work donation policies remaining lodged on 21.11.19 to the total of workersemployed in industry, i.e. 3.14Out-of-Work Donation. The abolition of the Out-of-Work Donation to civilianscontinues to elicit a series of suggestions from Labour for dealing with unemployment,and the usual number of protests from Trade Union branches, &amp;c, are recorded.  The(C 1938) 3 T 2
Newcastle Labour Party is circulating a letter recommending the adoption of resolutionsdemanding, first, the immediate re-establishment of the State Donation at a considerablyincreased rate, and, second, the national adoption of a fluctuating working week, so asto employ every available worker an equal number of hours in a fixed proportion to theamount of work to be done. It is reported that in Manchester a movement has beeninaugurated to press upon the Government the duty of enacting that industries shouldmaintain their own reserve of labour.. The Beeston Hill (Leeds) District Council of theA.S.L.E. &amp; F. has resolved to recommend a general stoppage of industry unless the dona-tion is continued, or employment found by the Government for those willing to work.The President of the Sheffield branch of the A.S.E. suggests a mass deputation from allparts of the country to the House of Commons to protest against the abolition of thedonation. In a lengthy article in the current issue of the &quot; Shop Assistant,&quot; it is main-tained that the decision to abolish the Out-of-Work Donation will throw an immenseburden on the Trade Unions. The Labour Movement, it insists, &quot; cannot afford to remainpassive under this latest blow ; the right to work must be pressed home, &apos; Work or Main-tenance &apos; must be the battle cry. It is the duty of the Government to provide eitherwork or maintenance preferably work.&quot; There appears to be an idea among certainelements in the Labour Movement that the abolition of the donation is prompted by acapitalist plot to glut the Labour market and thus reduce wages. Protests against thecessation of the Donation have been made by Labour members of Nottingham CityCouncil, a meeting of the National Union of General Workers at Nelson, and meetingsof unemplojred at Manchester, Newcastle, Norwich, Sheffield and Bradford.Some constructive suggestions have been made by the Labour Correspondent of the&quot; Manchester Guardian &quot; (Sth inst.), who expresses the view that the general body ofopinion in the Labour world desires a Bill to deal with unemployment embodying thefollowing characteristics : (1) That it shall be non-contributory so far as the workersare concerned; (2) That part of the charge at least shall be placed directly on eachindustry, so that the &quot; reserve of labour &quot; in the industry is treated as an element in thecost of production ; (3) That the scheme should include direct measures for preventingunemployment by steadying the demand for labour as well as for maintaining the unem-ployed; (4) That the Trade Unions should, themselves, directly administer unemploy-ment benefit to their members on the lines of the Cotton Control scheme which operatedduring the war ; (5) That the scheme should be universal, and should provide for benefitsat least at a rate which will afford a minimum living wage.Dockers&apos; Entrance -Fees.--The announcement that the Liverpool Executive Councilof the National Union of Dock Labourers has decided to introduce an entrance fee of 5 Os. Id. for all new members has attracted much attention. Only two exceptions areallowed to this new rule, demobilised men who were dockers before the war may join free,and sons of existing members may join on payment of 10s. 4i. The immediate cause ofthe imposition of this high entrance fee is stated to be the surplus of labour which existsat the docks, due to the withdrawal of the Out-of-Work Donation and the effect of themoulders&apos; strike in thiwing many labourers connected with the Engineering industryout of work. There is a more permanent and underlying cause, however, in the factthat the position of dock labourers as regards employment has always been insecure owingto the docks being a recognised retreat for those thrown out of employment in othertrades. Similar action is contemplated by the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and GeneralWorkers&apos; Union, which already permits different districts to fix their own entrance fee.The fixing of high entrance fees by Trade Unions is not, of course, a new,development.In the Electrical Trades Union the ordinary minimum entrance fee is 5s., but this canibe increased at the discretion of the branches, and during the war there were instances of:as much as  10 being asked by this Union as an entrance fee. The standpoint of theUnion in fixing high entrance fees has been stated by Mr. C. M. Citrine. He points out-that if a man belonging to the trade but not the Union comes along at the age of 35 withan application for membership, he has been getting the benefit of union conditions forwhich other people have been paying Is. %d. a week. The Union officials, therefore,usually total up what he would have paid if he had been a member, and levy that as hisentrance fee.Unrest in the Distributing Traces.-The strike at the Army and Navy Stores, thedetails of which are given in Part VI of this Report, is probably the precursor of effortson a large scale on the part of employees of large department stores to improve their wagesand conditions of work. Heretofore employees in such stores have not generally beenadequately organised and the methods of collective bargaining have not been used bythem to any considerable extent. In the last few months, however, many wage demandshave been made and both employers and employees have organised on a large scale.
Neither side, however, has had much experience of collective bargaining and the situationmay provide an opportunity for the exercise of the good offices of the Ministry. Itmay be mentioned also that the position of the distributing trades has been engagingthe special attention of the Trade Boards Division of the Ministry.Trade Union Topics.M.F.G.B. A special conference of the M.F.G.B. was held at the Central Hall on the8th inst., to consider the action to be taken by the Federation at the special Trade UnionCongress. It was decided to support the proposals with regard to nationalisation, butthere was much criticism of the resolution with reference to food prices. It was consideredthat there should be proposals of a definite character for immediate action to regulatefood prices and profits and the conference agreed to a comprehensive memorandum tofix shipping freights and also prices of all food products, boots, clothing, &amp;c. A proposalto set up a T.U.C. General Council also met with much opposition on the ground that itwas a reactionary proposal likely to hamper the freedom of action of trade unions. Theaction taken by the miners&apos; representatives in support of their views is noted above in theparagraph on the Trade Union Congress.Engineers and Shipbuilders. A conference of Trade Unions in the Engineering andShipbuilding trades to consider the deadlock in. the negotiations with regard to a 44-hourweek was held in London on the 5th inst., and it was agreed to waive the previous decisionof the workers to press for an independent chairman on the joint committee, which is toconsider the economic effect of a 44-hour week throughout the engineering and shipbuildingtrades.National Federation of General Workers. The first meeting of the London DistrictCommittee of this Federation was held in London on the 4th inst. It is reported that inaddition to this London Committee, district committees are being formed in Manchester,Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow, Swansea, and four other towns. It has been stipulatedthat no district committee should have power to sanction a strike without the consentof the committee of each of the affiliated unions and the endorsement of the executiveof the Federation. The report of the meeting of this committee obtained great publicityin the press, mainly, apparently, because it was taken to be a movement to stopunauthorised strikes.National Union of Clerks. The current number of the &quot; Clerk,&quot; the official organof this union, shows that some discussion is taking place within the Union, with a view&apos; to a development of the organisation of the Union in order to cater more fully for sectionaland local interests. The rapid development of the new unions-which usually call them-selves guilds for banking, shipping, insurance and law clerks shows the strength of thesesectional interests. In this connection it is interesting to note that a &quot; guild &quot; embracingbrewing, milling and allied trades clerks and administrative workers has been formedin the Cardiff area in connection with the N.U.C. The guild has a membership of 750.This represents an interesting difference from the action of the Burton-on-Trent branchof the N.U.C. (consisting mainly of brewery clerks) in transferring to the Workers&apos; Union.(Cf. Eeport, 1st October, p. 288.)Ex-Service Men.National Association of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers. A conference of this bodywas held in Birmingham on the 29th November. Reference was made to the offers madeof amalgamation with the Comrades of the Great War and strong criticism was advancedof the attitude taken up by the latter organisation. A resolution was passed protestingagainst the employment of female labour at the Employment Exchanges and urging thesubstitution of disabled men.Scottish Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers. A delegatemeeting of this Federation was held in Edinburgh on the 29th November, and it was decided,practically unanimously, not to form a political party. A resolution was passedagainst the employment of women in Government Departments until all unemployedex-Service men are absorbed.National Union of Ex-Service Men. It is reported that this Union has set upunemployment committees at Walham Green, Acton, Paddington and Shepherd&apos;s Bush.The central committee has passed a resolution calling upon the Government to introducelegislation for a permanent donation.Ex-Service Metis Grievances. In connection with the reply of the Prime Minister tovarious demands of ex-Service men, Mr. T. F. Lister, President of the National Federation
of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers, has announced that it has been arrangedthat a demonstration should be held in January, to be representative of the whole of theBritish Isles, which will demand that the Premier shall receive a deputation with regardto the grievances of ex-Service men.Training of Disabled Soldiers. Protests against the training of more disabled soldiersas boot repairers appear in the reports of the Hull and Newcastle branches of the NationalUnion of Boot and Shoe Operatives on the ground that the increasing supply ofrepairers will result in a reduction of wages. Referring to the National Committee&apos;sdesire that 5 per cent, of disabled ex-Service men should be trained in the engineeringindustry, the Gateshead-on-Tyne branch of the Steam Engine Makers&apos; Society statesthat it cannot see its way to adopt this recommendation owing to increasing unemployment,the surplus of apprentices and the attempts of certain employers in the district to introduceAmerican methods into workshops.Part V. Departmental and District Reports.(1) Departmental Reports.Appointments Department.Appointments. During the week ending the 28th November, 1,416 candidates wereavailable for appointments. The number of candidates known to have been placed duringthe week was 519, making a total to the 28th November of 17,626.Training Grants Scheme. The Grants Committees have received from the DistrictSelective Committees, 12,585 applications for training, of which 9,241 have so far beensanctioned.Employment Department.Work of the Court of Referees. Up to the 27th November 375,081 claims to out-of-workdonation had been referred to appeals offices in Great Britain. Of this number 346,615had been heard by the Courts of Referees. An analysis of 330,652 claims heard showsthat 85,540 were allowed, 244,581 disallowed and in 531 a compromise was effected. Theproportion of disallowances to claims heard is therefore 74 per cent. Of the totaldisallowances 45.3 per cent, were disallowed, owing to refusal to accept suitableemployment.Prosecutions for Fraud. Up to the 5th December 1,645 cases had been referred to thesolicitor with a view to prosecution for attempted fraud in connection with out-of-workdonation. In 652 cases the defendant was fined, in 173 imprisoned, in 68 bound over,and in six admonished.  In 167 cases the summonses were dismissed.Unemployment. On the 28th November, 484,344 men and 66,242 women were onthe live register. Vacancies remained, available for 27,713 men and 44,829 women.

The national working agreement for the Scottish baking tradewas agreed by a special meeting of the Council on the 25th November at Glasgow. Itprovides for a 5s. advance in wages and a 44-hour week. Work is not to start earlierthan 4 a.m. and men starting between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m. will receive additional payment.All operative bakers and confectioners employed are to be members of the OperativeBakers and Confectioners of Scotland National Federal Union. The agreement may beterminated by three months&apos; notice, which cannot be given until four months from thesigning of the agreement.
Metallic Bedsteads. The report of the Dilution Sub-Committee was accepted bythe Council on the 1st December. The Sub-Committee will have power to settle questionsbrought before it by individual workers and to permit employers to employ unskilledlabour in certain specified cases.Cable-making. On the 4th December the Council approved the constitution forDistrict Councils. It was agreed to give a 5s. advance to men over 18 years of age. Anagreement was reached for the stabilisation of wages for six months, the employers engagingto consider sympathetically an application in four months if a general engineering awardwas then given.Rubber-manufacturing. On&apos;the 4th December the employers side offered an increaseof 5s. to men over 18, wages to be stabilised for six months. This offer was accepted.The Council decided to send a deputation to the Minister to explain the difficulty causedto members of the association when outside firms are not obliged to pay these increases.Admiralty. A conference between the trade union side of the Council and representa-tives of the general labour unions was held on the 4th December to consider the claimsof general labour to increased representation on the Council. No agreement could bereached between the craft unions and the general labour unions.Wages and Arbitration Department.Interim Court of Arbitration. The total number of awards made by the Courts was932.  The last five awards cover cases in the Scottish engineering trade.Government Contracts: Special Wages Clause. In view of the changed conditionsregarding alterations in wages involved in the Industrial Courts Act the Departmenthave suggested to the Treasury the desirability of a conference between representativesof the Treasury, the contracting Departments and this Ministry to discuss future policyin connection with the Special Wages Clause in Government contracts.Canteen Workers. The National Federation of Women Workers and the Londonand District Association of Engineering Employers have agreed to refer to arbitrationa dispute as to the rates payable to canteen workers, as a difference as to what constitutesthe prescribed and the substituted rates.Payment of Wages by Agreement at a Rate lower than Prescribed Rate. Under theIndustrial Courts Act it is no longer possible for an agreement for the payment of wageslower than the prescribed or substituted rate to be approved by the Minister, thusregularising the legal position. The Solicitors opinion is that though there is nothingto prevent such an agreement it would in terms of the statute be void. No protectionwould therefore be afforded to the employer if the workman or the trade union chose toprosecute him for paying a rate lower than the prescribed or substituted rate. Theemployer must therefore estimate the probability of adherence by the workman to the termsof such an understanding.Trade Boards Division.Brush and Broom Trade Board (Great Britain). At a meeting of a Special Committeelists of piece rates for hand-finishing, hand-drawing and bone brush making were prepared,and it was agreed to recommend the Trade Board to fix general minimum piece rateson the basis of these rates. The Committee also agreed to recommend to the Board thefixing of minimum rates and conditions for apprentices in 10 specified groups of occupationsand the fixing of special rates for girls who enter the trade at and over the age of 15.Rope, Twine and Net Trade Board. The first meeting of this Board was held on4th and 5th December, and the Board resolved to issue a Notice of Proposal to fix minimumrates for male workers of 21 years of age and over, and female workers of 18 years of ageand over, together with a scale of minimum rates for younger workers. The Boardappointed a Committee to formulate a piece price list of work in which home workersare engaged. A Committee was also appointed to consider and report upon the minimumrates, if any, that should be proposed for skilled male workers.Corset Trade Board.-Th.e Minister has made an Order, dated the 25th November,1919, confirming the general minimum time rates, piece-work basis time rates and overtimerates fixed by the Board for male and female workers, and specifying 1st December, 1919,as the date from which they become effective.Sugar Confectionery and Food Preserving Trade Board (Great Britain). The Ministerhas made an Order, dated November the 28th, 1919, confirming the minimum time ratesfixed by the Board for female workers employed in certain processes which are regarded
as men&apos;s work, and has specified the 1st December, 1919, as the date from which theyshall become effective. Overtime rates have also been fixed and for this purpose 48 hourshas been declared the normal working week.Boot and Shoe Repairing Trade Board (Ireland). The Board have issued a Noticeof Proposal to fix general minimum time rates for men and women, for a 48-hour week,and overtime rates.Boot and Shoe Repairing Trade Board (Great Britain). With the consent of the Ministerthe Board have issued a Notice of Proposal to vary the general minimum time rates toIs. 6d. per hour for certain types of male workers, and 2s. an hour for men and womenemployed on surgical work, and to fix minimum time rates for female workers 21 years ofage and over (for a week of 48 hours), of 655. when employed on finishing or benchingwork; 45s. when employed in a productive department on patching machines, withcorrespondingly lower rates for workers under that age, and overtime rates.Tobacco Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board have, with the consent of the .Minister, issued a Notice of Proposal dated the 6th December, 1919, to vary the minimumrates of wages for learners to hand or mould cigar making by excluding the first 12 monthsof their learnership from the operation of the minimum rates.(2) District Reports.London and South-Eastern.Unemployment. The live register for the week ending the 21st November shows anincrease of 1,048 men and a decrease of 1,664 women. Forty exchanges record increases,Brighton, Brixton, Clapham Junction, Shepherd&apos;s Bush, and Tooting being the mostprominent.  The chief decreases are shown at Camden Town, Edgware Road, and Woolwich.Employment of Ex-Service Men. Canning Town Employment Committee has putforward the proposal that as the 5 per cent, basis under the National Scheme bears unfairlyon many industries, Employment Committees should be empowered to permit an alter-native undertaking of 8 per cent, of male employees in cases where a considerable proportionof women are employed.South Midlands and Eastern.Unemployment. The live register for the week ending the 21st November shows anincrease of 1,124 men and a decrease of 313 women. The highest percentages of unem-ployment are recorded at Colchester, Ipswich, Norwich, and Letchworth. An influx ofagricultural workers and demobilised soldiers is affecting the position at Cambridge. Thepremature termination of the fishing season has diminished the prospects of increasedemployment at Lowestoft.

Smethwick, Stourbridge and Tiptonrecord the chief decreases.Effect of Ironfaunders&apos; Strike. The signs of distress among the families of thoseaffected by the strike become more marked each week. The strikers in the Black Countryarea continued their efforts to bring out the members of other unions working in certain ofthe light castings shops, but with comparatively little success. About 100 brass casters,and moulders were brought out from a Walsall firm, but resumed work next day. Thesemen were members of the Brassworkers and Metal Mechanics&apos; Union, which has nearly1,000 members in the Walsall district, the majority of whom are at work. In WestBromwich and district the feud between the General Workers&apos; Union and the ironfounders.(in connection with which a strike was in operation prior to the general stoppage), has beenintensified during the week by the distribution of circulars in which the Workers&apos; Unionreplied to what they regard as insulting references in the Ironfounders&apos; Monthly Journal.Building Trade. A shortage of skilled labour, particularly bricklayers, and a shortageof cement and glass are holding up the development of the building trade.Yorkshire and East Midlands.Unemployment. No statistics of unemployment are available for this week.

The live register for the week ending the 21st November shows a.decrease of 1,216 men and of 75 women. The situation is undoubtedly improving, andif the transport difficulties could only be overcome, a big reduction in the unemploymentfigures would result. The highest percentages of unemployment are shown at Cardiff,Newport and Swansea, the chief occupations affected being general labourers, shipyardlabourers, dock labourers, clerks, seamen and messengers among men, clerks and domestics,among women.Shortage of Transport. There have been frequent stoppages of work at the mines-owing to the scarcity of wagons. As a result of the consequent shortage of coal, steelworks have been obliged to close down and tinplate workers have also stopped work forlack of steel. In addition to the coal shortage, the delay in transit of acid to tinplateworks has suspended operations in the finishing departments at many works for some dayseach week. The demand for Welsh tinplates is still increasing. Unfortunately, althoughthere are prompt buyers, manufacturers are so handicapped by transport difficulties thatthey cannot cope successfully with the demand.Scotland.Unemployment. The live register for the week ending the 21st November recordsan increase of 149 men and a decrease of 952 Avomen.  The registrations at Johnstone areincreasing, owing chiefly to slackness in the engineering trades.  The shortage of flax:is causing apprehension at local mills.   At Edinburgh large numbers of plasterers,painters and engineers are recorded on the live register.  At Perth the dyeing industry isslack, and consequent discharges among Avomen are feared.  The situation at Leithcontinues serious and the Town Council are being urged to speed up their housing schemes.in order to provide relief.  At Ayr no fresh arrivals of shipping at the docks have beennotified and unemployment is rife among dockers and shipyard workers.  The continued,discharges from Invergordon dockyard are intensifying unemployment at Inverness.The industrial position at Aberdeen is encouraging, and further improvement is anticipated,consequent upon the termination of the trawl dispute.(C 1938) 3 U
Shortage of Material. In Scotland generally, production at the small shipyards andengineering firms is seriously handicapped by a scarcity.of steel bars and iron, and it hasbeen suggested that if the export of steel were stopped until home industries were supplied,the unemployment question, would not be so complicated or so acute., &quot; Measures in Relief of Unemployment. -At Aberdeen the extension of the Great Northof Scotland Railway on the Buchan line is absorbing a large number of men. The SelkirkTown Council have granted permission for the erection, of &quot; Gretna bungalows &quot; for theaccommodation of imported workers, and the serious shortage of labour should now beremedied.Part VI. Disputes.(a) Involving a Stoppage of WorkBuilding and Allied Trades.Painters: Derbyshire. It is reported that a lock-out of about 60 painters occurred atChesterfield at the end of last week. The trouble arose over the action of one firm (Messrs.Eyres, a non-federated firm), in paying more than the minimum district rate agreed upon bythe Chesterfield Employers&apos;&apos;Association. The Union, although it had agreed that none of &quot;itsmembers should work for non-federated firms, declined to call out the men employed at Messrs., Eyres.  Accordingly, the Federated Employers locked out their own operatives.Metal, Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades.Ironfounders&apos; Strike.

Smith (Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federa-tion), were appointed a sub-committee to arrange a joint meeting either in London or Manchesterat the earliest possible moment. The Associated Irohmoulders of Scotland have agreed tocome out whenever the English strikers demand it, while Welsh moulders in Pontypool andDistrict have decided on a sympathetic strike, although their own wages demands were settledby a local agreement some weeks ago. This offer involves about 5,000 men, so that a consider-able extension of the strike appears inevitable.Tinplate Workers: South Wales.

Negotiations have been proceeding since June, culminating in an offer of the Employersto grant 2s. an hour.
