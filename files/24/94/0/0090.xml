At the commencement of the recent war the daily rates of pay of ArmyChaplains were as follows^ : 5. d.4th Class (on appointment)...      ...      ......   10 04th Class (after  5 years&apos; service) ...      ......   12 63rd Class (  ,,   10        ,,        ).........   15 02nd Class (       15        ,,        ).........   17 61st Class ( ,,   20        ,,        ).....&quot;.      ...   20 01st Class (-.,,. -.25      &apos;           )......      ...   22 6These rates had been in force for many years previously, and had not been revisedsince at least 1873, possibly earlier.2. During the war, Army Chaplains have shared in the following financialadvantages given to officers generally : (a.) Raising of pay of lowest rank in each branch of the Service to a minimum of10s. 6d. a day, with consequential increases in higher ranks (Army Order43, 1918).(b.) Children&apos;s allowance to junior officers (Army Order 44, 1918).(c.) Army of Occupation bonus (Army Order 54, 1919).(a) and (c) have increased their emoluments as follows: 	Pay in	Increase under.

The experience gained during the war showed clearly the need for considerablechanges in the organization and conditions of service of the Royal Army Chaplains&apos; Depart-ment, and after very careful consideration by the two War Office Advisory Committeesinterested in Chaplaincy Services (one, presided over by Lord Salisbury, concerned withChurch of England only, and the other representing and acting for all the principaldenominations), as well as by the executive officials of the War Office, a scheme ofreorganization was approved by me and submitted to&apos; the Treasury for sanction inJune, 1919. The essence of this scheme was that the Royal Army Chaplains&apos; Deparfc-ment should be organized in classes or grades, to each of which a fixed establishmentwas to be assigned, and promotion from any one to the next higher should be by* Here, and throughout the memorandum, the allowances which Army Chaplains draw, in common withother officers of the Army, are disregarded.
selection. This was to replace the present system of promotion by length of serviceonly. Also, the pay of Chaplains should be raised to an equality with that of combatantofficers of corresponding rank in the Infantry.4. Simultaneously, the Cabinet had undertaken a revision of the rates of pay ofofficers and men of the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force generally. In thecourse of this revision they sanctioned a special scale for Chaplains in the Royal Navy,and Royal Air Force commencing at ll. a day on appointment and rising by triennialincrements of 3s. to a maximum of 21. 10s. a day (reached after 30 years&apos; service). Sucha scale, governed as to increments solely by length of service, was clearly contrary tothe essential features of the new scheme for the Royal Army Chaplains&apos; Department,and though they had not the details of this scheme before them, the Cabinet agreedthat a different scale, appropriate to the proposed new conditions as to promotion, &amp;c,might be fixed for Army Chaplains, provided that the total cost of the Departmentunder such a scale did not exceed what it would be if its officers were paid on a basissimilar to that approved for Chaplains in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force.A revised scale has been worked out on this basis and gives the following result: Proposed pay of Chaplains.				Pay of officers of corresponding rank in Infantry, &amp;c.				 	s.	d.		 	s.	d.4th Class (on probation)	1	0	0	Captain, lower rate......	1	3	G4th Class (on being accepted for permanent	1	3	6	Captain, higher rate (after 15 years&apos;	1	6	0commission, after not less than 3 years&apos; pro-				service).			bationary service).							3rd&apos;Class        ........	1	10	0	Major	1	11	6				Major, after 5 years as such	1 X	17	02nd Class        .......      .....	2	0	0		2	7	G1st Class..      .a      .*      ..              ..	2	10	0	Colonel..       ......	2	1.5	05. I was, however, not myself aware until now that my original proposal forChaplains to receive the same rates as combatant officers of corresponding rank hadbeen referred back in the way indicated above, and I regret that I cannot regard therates for Army Chaplains shown in the foregoing paragraph as satisfactory. The ratesrecently authorized for officers of corresponding rank in other branches of the Service&quot;are shown for the purpose of comparison in that paragraph, and I consider that to paythe Chaplains so much less than other officers is bound to create an impression that theArmy Council set a low estimate on the value of their services, and is likely to resultin a failure to obtain in the Royal Army Chaplains&apos; Department a full measure of theassistance which it is in their power to render, nor will it succeed in securing for theArmy the interest of a class of the community whose support, enjoyed during the war,it is for many reasons very desirable to retain.6. To grant to Army Chaplains, serving under the proposed new conditions ofservice, the pay already authorized for Infantry officers of corresponding rank, wouldcost approximately 7,7001. per annum more than to give them the rates indicated inparagraph 4, on the total establishment of 117 Regular Chaplains at present authorized.It will probably be found necessary in the near future to make some increase inthis establishment in order to provide for certain denominations not formerly representedin the Department, and for other after-war conditions, but this question will be takenup separately on its merits.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.12th December, 1919.
