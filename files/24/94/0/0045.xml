Following for your Prime Minister: Begins: Ratification by America of the Peace Treaty still hangs inthe balance, and opponents of ratification are making great playwith the argument that if a &quot; dispute likely to lead to arupture.&quot; between a foreign Power arid the United Kingdom, or any oneof the four Dominions or India, were brought before the Assembly of theLeague under Article 15 all the other five votes could be cast in support ofthe part of the Empire immediately affected although the memberrepresenting it could not vote. This is in our opinion a wrong interpretation.We hold that the representatives of all parts of the Empire would bedebarred from voting in this particular case, i.e., sl &quot; dispute likely to lead toa rupture &quot; between a foreign Power and any State of the Empire.Our Ambassador at Washington, Viscount Grey, is urging us most strongly tomake a declaration to this effect, which, he believes, would have adecisive influence on the American Senate&apos;s decision. But we haverefused to sanction this course without the assent of the DominionGovernments. I should be glad to know at the earliest possible datewhether your Government would approve of such a declaration being made.It would be made perfectly clear, of course, that the declaration referredonly to the particular case just explained, which might arise underArticle 15, and that in all other respects the rights of the United Kingdomand the Dominions and India as six original members of the League werenot affected.It has, I ought to add, also been contended in the United States that BritishEmpire should not have more than one member on Council of League atthe same time, but His Majesty&apos;s Government has refused definitely toaccept any reservation which would prejudice eligibility of a Dominion orof India to be selected as one of the &quot;four other members of the League,&quot;whose representatives are to sit on the Council.

Referring to your cipher telegram of 8th November,^ forwardingmessage for Prime Minister respecting ratification by United States of America ofPeace Treaty, I have given your message to Minister of Justice who is now ActingPrime Minister as Prime Minister still away in the United States of America,Mr. Doherty is giving it immediate consideration, but as Sir Robert has to beconsulted answer cannot be expected for a few days.-Devonshire.64704No. 3.Union of South Africa.The GOVERNOR-GENERAL to the SECRETARY OF STATE.(Received 4.8 p.m., November 11, 1919.)Telegram. &apos;(Paraphrase.)November 11. With reference to your telegram 8th November,^ regarding theLeague of Nations. My Prime Minister is much averse to proposed declaration.The following are his views: Disputes likely to lead to rupture will be dealt withas a rule by. Council and not by Assembly. Now in Council at present, and for along time to come, British Empire has one vote only, that of the United Kingdom.This vote would almost inevitably be eliminated by proposed declaration (?) where-ever Dominion is party to dispute, for even if the declaration is limited to disputesbefore Assembly it will be contended that the same principle applies to disputesbefore Council, and that in the latter case also United Kingdom should not vote insupport of one of Dominions. Thus, in dispute between South Africa and Japanbefore League of Nations, for instance, former might completely lose UnitedKingdom support in Assembly as well as in Council. Declaration might seriouslyweaken position of British Empire and ability of United Kingdom to supportDominions.There appears to be no reason if in exceptional case dispute is referred toAssembly why other parts of the British Empire should not vote in the same wayas South and Central American Republics, which are in very much the same positionas Dominions to United States of America.* This assurance was as follows : &quot; The question having1 been raised as to the meaning of Article IV of the League of NationsCovenant, we have been requested by Sir Robert Borden to state whether we concur in his view that,upon the true construction of the first and second paragraphs of that Article, representatives of theSelf-governing Dominions of the British Empire may be selected or named as members of the Council.We have no hesitation in expressing our entire concurrence in this view. If there were any doubt itwould be entirely removed by the fact that the Articles of the Covenant are not subject to a narrow ortechnical construction.&quot; G. Clemenceau.&quot; Wood row Wilson.&quot; D. Lloyd George.&quot; Dated at the Quai d&apos;Orsay, Paris,the sixth day of May, 1919.&quot;
For, even assuming position in Council was not affected, proposed declarationwould constitute great inducement to party to dispute with a Dominion to claimthat matter should be referred to the Assembly under clause 15, and it wouldautomatically secure thereby elimination of votes of Dominions and UnitedKingdom in the matter. Further serious defect in proposed declaration is thatit identifies Dominions with United Kingdom as one single entity before Leagueof Nations, while whole case fought for and achieved by Dominions was theirseparate recognition and individual nationhood in League.Had issue now raised by United States been foreseen at Paris, Dominionswould have ensured their position in same way as they did with regard to theirright to eventual representation on Council. Question of Dominions&apos; status inLeague is calculated to be raised once more by American contention, and this fromSouth African point of view is most undesirable.

Your Secret and urgent telegram of 8th November,^ and mytelegram of 10th November.! Following from Mr. Doherty, Acting PrimeMinister: Begins: &quot;Immediately after prorogation other Ministers, in Prime Minister&apos;sabsence, considered your message, and it is their opinion that proposeddeclaration would be not only unwise but entirely ineffective for the purposenamed. Ministers will confer with the Prime Minister in New York.&quot; Devonshire. 1   &apos;Note. For Sir R.

Following from my Prime Minister : Begins: &quot;Urgent. Secret. Your telegram, 8th November,^ ratification ofTreaty of Peace by America. I do not agree with your interpretation; atall events, without some material reservations. Commonwealth Govern-ment, perhaps naturally, regards matter from a different standpoint fromthat of United Kingdom. In the event of your interpretation beingaccepted, and should a dispute be likely to lead to a rupture betweenAustralia and Japan over, say, immigration equal treatment for allnationals, Australia could not present her own case in an appeal to theLeague, nor could the voice of South Africa, Canada, or New Zealand, beheard. This would be most unsatisfactory, and in spite of [groupomitted] Australia might ask&quot; what she had to gain from a League ofNations, when not only her own voice is to be silenced but also those of hersister Dominions, in the only matter out of which war in-the future is likelydirectly to menace her. One of two things is obvious, Dominions eitherhave or have not right of separate representation on League. We foughtfor that in the British Empire delegation. It was agreed in definiteterms. While quite recognising your difficulties, I am unable to agree toabandoning our right to sit on League of Nations on footing of equalitywith other small Powers. Hughes.&quot; Ends Ferguson.

Private and Personal. My telegram to your Prime Minister*of evendate League of Nations.Please take an early opportunity of raising. this question with your PrimeMinister.You should emphasise to him the fact that the statement for which Lord Greyis pressing may well be a leading factor in the fate of the League of Nations.Senators who are keen supporters of the League have explained to him the greatdifficulty in which they find themselves by their inability to cope with the argumentsput forward by opponents &quot;of the League on this point. Milner.No. 2.Commonwealth of Australia.The SECRETARY OF STATE to the GOVERNOR-GENERAL.(Sent 10.20 p.m. November 8, 1919.)(Paraphrase.)November 8. . Private and Personal.See my telegram to your Prime Minister of to-day* re League of Nations.You should take an early opportunity of discussing this question with yourPrime Minister, emphasising the fact that the question only arises in a practicalform in connection with disputes &quot; likely to lead to a rupture&apos;&apos; under Article XVof the Covenant. It is precisely such disputes which involve the danger of war,which must necessarily be a matter of equal concern to all parts of the British Empire.Possibility of war involves possibility of blockade, in which event every Dominionwould be treated equally as part of the British Empire by a foreign belligerentPower. Moreover, it is only by emphasising the fact that the Empire is a single unitin disputes of this character that we can hope to maintain the position that theLeague has no right to intervene in questions at issue between the different parts ofthe Empire, such a question for instance as&apos; Asiatic emigration from India to oneof the Dominions.The proposed declaration would in no way affect the status of the Dominionsas members of the League side by side with the Mother Country, since the limitationof voting power in the particular case would apply to the United Kingdom equallywith the Dominions.

My telegram torday* : League of Nations.&quot;When I received your first telegram Sunday afternoon I discussed matter with myPrime Minister the same afternoon, just before he was leaving on a tour, and heput his views in writing as I have already cabled to you. Your private and personalwire only reached me on Monday morning when my Prime Minister was out ofpersonal reach. But I held up telegram until I could speak to him on the telephone,and then read your telegram. However, he adhered to his previous view, and I knowin drawing up his reply he quite appreciated Grey&apos;s anxiety and the position in theUnited States as explained in your first telegram. I am afraid that his reply willbe a disappointment to His Majesty&apos;s Government, but Prime Minister I know feltno doubts in his mind as to his reply. I have of course myself no opinion to offerof any value on the merits.

Iinterviewed Hughes, and found him quite unwilling to accept the interpretationsuggested by Lord Grey or to abandon any rights of representation on League ofNations. He was unmoved by the suggestion of any interference by League asbetween India and Dominions, considering that it would be likely only to affectSouth Africa. -He is convinced that British sentiment is so warm towards Australia, thatsupport of Mother Country would be assured to Australia in any difficulty withforeign Powers.

SECEET.POSITION OP THE DOMINIONS IN RELATION TO THELEAGUE OF NATIONS.III.Diplomatic Correspondence.No. 1.Paraphrase Telegram. VISCOUNT GREY (Washington), October 9, 1919.(Received 11.40 a.m., October 10, 1919.)(No. 1439.)It is alleged by opponents of Covenant here that in a4 dispute between, forinstance, Canada and United States, in which United States would be precludedfrom voting as well as Canada, the other five votes of British Empire could be usedon side of Canada in League of Nations Assembly. Supporters of the League main-tain that not one of votes of British Empire could be used under last paragraph ofArticle XV of Covenant in any controversy in which any part of British Empirewas concerned. Latter view is presumably correct. If anything has been said toshow that is the view of British Government please give me reference. If not, itwould be very desirable to have a question in Parliament and an answer makingthis clear.No. 2.Paraphrase Telegram.  VISCOUNT GREY (Washington), October 11, 1919.(Despatched October 11, 1919; Received 10.10 a.m., October 12, 1919.)(No. 1443. Secret.)In Senate most serious danger to Covenant seems to be opposition to Britishsix votes power in League Assembly. Eirst Contention is that the six votes shouldnot be used in any controversy to which any part of British Empire is a party.This would put British Empire on the same footing in the Assembly as any otherPower which is a party to same controversy. If questioned, may I say this is viewof His Ma!jesty&apos;s Government?Second point is that British Empire should not have on Council of Leaguemore than one member at the same time. A reservation that a British self-governingDominion shall in no case have representative on Council may be proposed. Thisseems to me clearly objectionable, but would His Majesty&apos;s Government considerimpossible of acceptance a reservation that British Empire should not have morethan one representative on Council at the same time 1President might at any moment have raised these questions with me had hebeen well; his supporters, unable at present to consult him, are in suspense, butthey may be driven by Presidents illness to sound me directly as to what compromisecould be made on reservations without being fatal from British point of view ofCovenant.Wt.     /154  40  F.O.P.  11/19   [1548 a]
Paraphrase Telegram to VISCOUNT GREY (Washington).(No. 1924.)  D. Foreign Office, October 24, 1919, 10 p.m.Question raised in the first paragraph of your telegram, No. 1443,* presentsno serious difficulty. The six votes in the Assembly which between them the BritishEmpire, the British Dominions, and India are entitled to give in the Assembly ofthe League of Nations should not, in our view, be used in any controversy to whichany part of the British Empire is a party. The following are the reasons whichhave led us to this conclusion : The question arises in connection with Article 15 of the Covenant and thesettlement of disputes likely to lead to a rupture. It is implied by the phrase&quot; likely to lead to a rupture &quot; that the dispute is one which might lead to war,and the party to the dispute must be the political unit which, in the event of war,would become belligerent. There cannot be war between a foreign State and a partonly of the British Empire. For one part of the Empire to be at war while anotherremained at peace would be impossible, consequently the party to the dispute mustbe the British Empire as a whole, and neither the representative of the Empire northat of any particular Dominion accepting membership of the League nor that ofIndia could claim that he stood on a different footing from that of the representativeof the part of the Empire more immediately concerned in the dispute.So far as Article 15 is concerned the question of voting turns not on member-ship of the League but on being a party to the dispute, and the full membership ofthe League which the Dominions and India enjoy is not in any way diminished bythe fact that a Dominion^ vote would be excluded from the calculation in a contro-versy where another Dominion was concerned.With regard to the second paragraph of your telegram, any reservation whichwould prejudice the eligibility of a Dominion or of India to be selected as one ofthe &quot; four other Members of the League&quot; whose representatives are to sit on theCouncil could not be accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government. The question wasraised in Paris, and President Wilson and M. Clemenceau and the Prime Ministergave Sir R. Borden a written assurance that, in their view, representatives of theDominions might be selected or named as members of the Council upon the trueconstruction of the first two paragraphs of Article 4 of the Covenant.We must stand by this absolutely.No. 4.Paraphrase Telegram to VISCOUNT GREY (Washington).,(No. 1925.) Foreign Office, October 24, 1919, 10 p.m.My telegram immediately preceding.!There has been no time to consult the Dominion Governments, and no doubtyou will bear in mind the great risk involved in expressing opinions in which theirGovernments have not concurred, on the rights and status of the Dominions and ofIndia as members of the League.It would therefore be much better not to make any formal declaration on thesubject if it is possible to avoid doing so.No. 5. .Paraphrase Telegram.  VISCOUNT GREY (Washington), October 26, 1919.(Despatched October 26, 1919; Received 8.55 a.m., October 27, 1919.)(No. 1499.   Urgent.)Have now received your telegram No. 1924.1If telegraphed at once to American press an answer to a question in Parliamenton first point in this sense would be invaluable.
I am not asked for public statement here, but it is urged that a spontaneousexpression of opinion in England would be helpful.I take last paragraph of your telegram to confirm my view that a reservationexcluding self-governing Dominions from eligibility to Council of League isimpossible of acceptance, and I shall advise in that sense if approached by SenatorHitchcock or by administration.I do not see that same objection applies to a reservation that no country shouldhave on Council more than one member at same time, but this point has not yet beenput to me. My general line is that all reservations are to be deprecated, but lateron I may be asked what would be absolutely fatal and what would not.No. 6.Paraphrase Telegram to VISCOUNT GREY (Washington).(No. 1973.) Foreign Office, October 31, 1919.   7 p.m.Referring to your telegram No. 1499* (of October 26th, voting power ofBritish Empire on the League of Nations), it is undesirable to answer a question inthe House as you propose for reasons given in my telegrams Nos. 1924t and 19254This view is strengthened by report in the press, which, I presume, is accurate,that the amendments of Messrs. Shields and Moses, designed to restrict the votingpower of the Empire, have been rejected by the Senate.No. 7.Paraphrase Telegram.    VISCOUNT GREY (Washington), November 13.(Received 10 a.m., November 14, 1919.)(No. 1569.)Yesterday Canadian Minister, Mr. Rowell, showed me Lord Milner&apos;s telegramto Canadian Government about British voting power on League of Nations. I was.not previously aware that Dominion Governments were actually being consulted byHis Majesty&apos;s Government on this point. Canadian Ministers are meeting Sir R.Borden to-day at New York, and Sir R. Borden comes here to-night. I will discussmatter fully with him and report what passes to your Lordship.No. 8.Paraphrase Telegram.   VISCOUNT GREY (Washington).   November 14.(Received 11.0 a.m., November i5, 1919.)(No. 1577.)Referring to my telegram No. 1569, g Sir R. Borden&apos;agrees that followingquestion should be put in House of Commons: &apos;&apos; To ask what upon a fair construction of League of Nations Covenantare voting rights under Article 15 of different parts of British Empire.&quot;Reply which Sir R. Borden thinks should be made and in which I entirelyconcur would be as follows: &quot; Members of League under Article 15 of Covenant do not vote upon a&apos; dispute likely to lead to rupture&apos; to which any of them are partners. Allparts of British Empire will be parties to any such dispute in which any oneof them is involved.&quot;While, therefore, in common with His Majesty&apos;s Governments of otherportions of the Empire, His Majesty&apos;s Government of United Kingdom firmlymaintains rights of United Kingdom of self-governing Dominions and of Indiaas members of League, it is not understood or contended that in case of a disputearising between any portion of the Empire and a foreign power likely to leadto a rupture, either United Kingdom or any self-governing Dominions or Indiawould be entitled to vote thereon in Assembly.&quot;
Reasons which still make an announcement desirable are that it is possible thatthough such an announcement would not apparently have any effect at this junctureupon fortunes of, Treaty and League in Senate, a deadlock may arise after presentstiff reservations are passed on point of ratification which may lead,to a compromiseon enforcement of milder resolutions as an alternative to complete failure of Treatyin Senate. In such a contingency, if announcement now suggested had been madeby His Majesty&apos;s Government, it might then help to ease situation. I entirelyagree with Sir R. Borden, who feels that complete failure of Treaty in Senate,followed by a separate peace between United States and Germany, would be acalamity, and that nothing should be omitted which might help to avert it, howeverslight the chance. I also feel, after such men as President Lowell of Havard,Secretary of State, and Senator Hitchcock, have urged privately that such anannouncement would be helpful, they will not understand our refusal to make it.Supporters of League in America have to defend British six votes in Assembly,and considerable odium is, however, unfairly being fastened on them on this groundboth in Senate and their constituencies by their political opponents. If we withholdthis announcement they will feel, whether they succeed or fail in their fight forLeague, that we have not played up to help them, and their soreness will probablybe even more in the event of failure than if they had won in Senate. Sir R. Bordenconcurs in this telegram, of which I have given him a copy.No/9.Paraphrase Telegram to VISCOUNT GREY (Washington).(No. 2062.) Foreign Office, November 18, 1919.   6 p.m.Your telegram 1577.*As you know, we consulted about the matter all the Dominions which aremembers of the League and invited their assent to our interpretation of Article. 15. *Replies have been received from Canada, Australia, and South Africa. These are*, all unfavourable. That of Canada may be discounted, as it was provisional only,pending consultation with Sir Robert Borden, and he agrees with you. But Hughesand Smuts both emphatically protest against the proposed declaration, and I fearthat, if we made it, they would proclaim their dissent publicly. Effect of this wouldbe disastrous, for not only would it exhibit to the world a most regrettable conflictof opinion within the Empire, but it would be certainly used by the Americanopponents of the Covenant as an argument to prove that their interpretation ofArticle 15 was right. Declaration would thus fail in its object of influencingAmerican opinion favourably, while it would involve us in an embarrassingcontroversy with some of the Dominions. In these circumstances I feel that itwould be most unwise for us-to commit ourselves publicly at the present time bysuch an answer in the House of Commons as you suggest, especially as it is, as youpoint out, very uncertain whether anything which we say could save situation in theSenate.I may add that some of the objections which have been raised to the proposeddeclaration, especially those by Smuts, seem to me to have considerable weight.
