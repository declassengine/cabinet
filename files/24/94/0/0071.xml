5 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF1 HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVSRNiBgMT)ST&apos;       : THL CENOTAPH IN, WHITEHALL.......Memorandum for the Cabinet by the Minister of Transport. HAU^c^b^--------------&apos;-----*---------------With reference to War Cabinet 654 Minute. 6, Idesire to call the attention of the Cabinet to arecommendation which&apos; I have received from the LondonTraffic Advisory Committee on tho subject of theproposal to erect a permanent cenotaph on the site ofthe present temporary one in Whitehall, and for whichI ask consideration before any irrevocable action istaken.2. In the view laf the Advisory Committee the presentposition of the cenotaph is a serious obstacle to theflow of traffic in so busy a main thoroughfare, and isextremely likely to cause accidents.     They point cutthat on Armistice Day no less than 25 mounted policeand 350 unmounted police were required to control thetraffic.     In vie.w of the fact that the cenotaph islikely to be visited by large numbers of people formany years to come they strongly recommend that itshould be removed to a position in the centre ofParliament Square where it would be flanked by theHouses of Parliament and Westminster Abbey.&quot;  Thisposition would be not only less dangerous for peoplevisiting the cenotaph but also has the advantage ofmore deeply grounded historical associations.3. The Committee points out that in view ofthe short period fw which the cenotaph has stood in itspresent position, the sentimental objoptions to itsremoval to Parliament Square cannot Tie very stronglyfounded, and in consideration of the probable developmentand expansion of surface traffic in London, tho Committeeurges its removal.     I know, the opinion - cf:my colleagues
was that It should, if possible, stand ./-- the sits on whichit received the salute of the Allied Pcraca and great Navaland Military Commanders, but in view of the report putforward I feel that this aspect of the case should not belightly disregarded and I beg therefore that its furtherconsideration may. take place.8th December, 1919.(Signed) ERIC GSDDES.
