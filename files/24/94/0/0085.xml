A brief account of the constitution K- .^f..W&apos;and emoluments of the Military Knights and of the object of the present proposals will     61be found in the Memorandum prefixed to the Bill. -The following additional informationregarding their origin, history and constitution will perhaps be of interest.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.llth December, 1919.1. The Royal or Upper Foundation is primarily supported by the provisions ofthe Will of Henry VIII. which were carried into effect by Letters Patent of QueenElizabeth in 1559. In this way lands yielding a yearly revenue of 6611. 6s. 8d. weregranted to the Dean and Chapter of Windsor to provide certain fixed annual allowancesfor the maintenance of the Knights amounting to 430/. per annum. The total valueof the lands on which this charge was created increased to 14,000/. per annum, but noincrease was made in the payments to the Knights. In 1833 an unsuccessful suit wasmade by the Knights for a proportionate increase in the amounts paid to them.In 1861, by 24 and 25 Viet., Ch. 116, Parliament appropriated in favour of theMilitary Knights the revenues of a suspended Canonry at Windsor (valued at about1,075/. per annum). By a Royal Warrant, dated 29th January, 1862, Queen Victoria,allotted this fund in equal shares among the 13 Knights after giving 20/. per annum tothe Knight who held the office of Governor.The Houses within the Chapter Close in which the Knights live were built forthem in Queen Marys reign.Each Knight of the Upper Foundation receives approximately per annum :     s.   d.By Queen Elizabeth&apos;s Statutes For attendance in chapel     ...      ...   18   5   0For attendance at obi its     ...      ...     0   6   8Uniform      ............     36821 18   4Source not stated Canons &quot; residence money&quot;       ...      ...      ...     110   0Exchequer money...       ...      ...      ...      ...   18   5   0Share of rent of Garter House ...      ...      ...     9   47By Act of Parliament Share of suspended canonry        ...      ...   75   7   8126   5   7The Governor receives in addition a &quot;statutory&quot; stipend of 3/. 6s. 8d., and anextra 20/. from the suspended canonry.2. The Private or Lower Foundation. The history of this Foundation commencesin the reign of Charles I.Sir Peter le Maire, by his Will dated. 8th January, 163], bequeathed the sum of1,500/. for such charitable uses as Sir Francis Crane should direct. The latter decidedto erect certain houses in Windsor Castle for the dwelling of five Alms Knights, andadded money of his own for, that purpose. By his Will dated 27th August, 1635, hecharged his executor, Sir Richard Crane, with seeing to the completion oi the buildings,and bequeathed 200/. per annum to be settled in lands for the perpetual maintenance offive Alms Knights.   By a Decree of the Court of Chancery dated 27th January, 1659,(1319/5-9)  SO   12/19   HAS  7780\vo
2  ,it was declared that the Manor of Carbrooke, in Norfolk, should for ever stand chargedwith the sum of-200/. per annum for the perpetual maintenance of five Alms Knights,and &apos;A0l per annum for repairs of the buildings at Windsor. IThe Carbrooke Estate is still charged with the payment of this money, and thehouses still form part of the endowment of the five Knights of the Lower Foundation.The Knights of this foundation are also entitled to the income of certain fundsknown as Sir George Bowles&apos; Augmentation. General Sir George Bowles died in 1870,and by his Will directed that, after certain legacies had been paid, the residue of hisestate should be given to charitable purposes. By an Order of the Master of the Bollsof I4th December, 1880, 2,083/. 6s. 8d consolidated Bank Annuities were purchased inthe name of &quot; The Official Trustees of Charitable Funds,&quot; the dividend to be distributedequally among the five Knights of the Lower Foundation.The above-mentioned sum still stands in the name of &quot; The Official Trustees ofCharitable Funds.&quot;Each Knight of the Lower Foundation now receives annually :   s. d.(a.) From the Endowment     ...      ...      ...      ...      43 14 0(b.) From Sir George Bowles&apos;augmentation ...      ...      10   8 4(c.) From the Dean and Chapter &quot; Residence Money &quot;        110 0Total      ...............      5512   4In 1912 the King proposed to abolish the Lower Foundation and to appropriatethe funds for the benefit of the 13 Knights of the Royal Foundation. As this involved,inter alia, the diversion of private trust funds, two questions were submitted to theLaw Officers of the Crown : (1.) Whether the King could, and if so in what manner, abolish the office or orderof the Lower Military Knights ?(2.J That done, in what way, if at all, could the endowments at present attributableto the benefit of the five Knights of the Lower Foundation be diverted for thebenefit of the 13 Knights of the Upper Foundation ?The Law Officers were of opinion that, as the Order is one of honour and dignity,the King could abolish it by Letters Patent. The endowments, however, would haveto be dealt with in due course of law and by the proper tribunals. To abolish theOrder and at the same time divert the trust funds, an Act of Parliament was the onlycomplete and unimpeachable method.An alternative method suggested but not recommended by the Law Officers was (1.) To abolish the Knights of the Lower Foundation by Letters Patent.(2.) To direct by these Letters Patent that the directions in the Decree of] 8th June, 1701, under which income during vacancies goes to the Governorshould not apply to future vacancies.(3.) That as soon as the five vacancies had been absorbed the Trustees of theCharity should apply to the Charity Commissioners for a scheme by whichthe income of the endowments of the Lower Foundation might be divertedto the Royal Foundation. There would be no certainty, however, that thisapplication would be successful.It was therefore decided that an Act of Parliament should be the method by whichthe King&apos;s proposals should be carried into effect.With regard to the repeal of the Decree of 1701, the Law Officers were of opinionthat, as this Decree was merely an administrative act of the Sovereign in Chapter ofthe Order of the Garter; its provisions could accordingly be modified or revoked in thesame manner as the order itself was made. For this reason there is no reference to theDecree in the present Bill.
Military Knights of Windsor Bill.MEMORANDUM.This Bill is intended to enable reforms to be carried out inthe constitution and emoluments of the Military Knights ofWindsor.These knights consist of retired officers appointed by HisMajesty and are at present divided into two classes: (1) Thirteen knights of the Royal or Upper Eoundation;and(2) Five knights of the Private or Lower Foundation.The endowments consist partly of benefactions under theWill of Henry VIII., and partly of private benefactions ofvarious dates. The endowments of the two foundations arequite separate, and the annual amount paid under them is atpresent approximately, in the case of knights of the UpperFoundation, 12QI. each, and in the case of knights of the LowerFoundation, 55/. each. In addition to this, the knights occupyquarters in Windsor Castle.The knights are appointed first to the Lower Foundation,and subsequently promoted to the Upper Foundation. Theendowments not being sufficient for the proper maintenance ofthe whole number of knights, it has been decided not to fillthe vacancies hereinafter occurring in the Lower Foundation,and ultimately to abolish that Foundation altogether. The wholeof the endowments will thus become available for the thirteenknights of the Upper Foundation.The abolition of the Lower Foundation can be effected byHis Majesty without statutory authority, but as the endowmentsof the two foundations are separate, it is necessary to providefor the necessary redistribution of funds.263-2a
