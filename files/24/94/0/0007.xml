PiUWHFLSE TELEGRAM:   From the Governor General of theCommonwealth of Australia to the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies.(Received Colonial Office,   10.40 a.m. 15th November 1919)Referring to my telegram of 10th September myPrime Minister sends following Begins Secret Mandates.    Noanswer yet received to my previous urgent telegram,Over six months have passed since the Council of Four agreedto the mandate for Pacific Islands and nearly six monthssince the Treaty of Peace containing basic terms of eachclass of mandate was signed yot Supreme Council&apos;s approvalhas not been given.    This is most unfortunate and causesmy Government great embarrassment and is calculated tocreate serious&apos;situation.    The Japanese are workingassiduously to secure trade of islands they are endeavour-ing to acquire titles to land and minerals and oil rightsand we can do nothing, failing formal appointment asmandatory,    I have sent Prime Minister urgent telegramin reply to one from him setting out urgency of settle-  .ment.    Position of Government in view of financial,economic and general conditions including Bolshevism andSinn Fein is sufficiently difficult in any case.   We arein the midst cf an election campaign it is surely nottoo much to ask that this question of mandate which ougjatto have been settled long ago should be dealt with atonce very urgent,    Hughes.,   End of Prime Minister&apos;3message.FERGUSON.,&apos; 0
