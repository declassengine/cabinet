Thlo Document is the Property of,Hio;3 .. i:i:i:c jVla^tfs GovernmentPETROLEUM DEPARTMENTMemorandum for the Cabinetid(French Agreement:    Export of oil from South Russia)As directed by the Cabinet at its meeting on the19th November, Minute No.7, I now bring forward two questionswhich were raised by the First Lord of the Admiralty, asMinister-ln-Charge of Petroleum Affairs, in his memorandum ofthe 11th November, and which were left over for further con-sideration.    These are:-(I)   The Agreement with the French Government onpetroleum matters,   and&quot;(II)   The question of the export of oil from SouthRussia.(I),   THE AGKE3HBNT TOH THB FRENCH GQVIHRMSNT,1.    The history of the negotiations leading up tothis Agreement has beon before the Cabinet.   Thenegotiations were initiated with Mr Balfourrs approvaland the various Departments concerned were kept in touchthroughout.   Subsequently it was decided by the I?ar Cabineton the 20th August that the agreement should be withdrawn,and I wish to recommend the reconsideration of this decision.2,    The following considerations appear to-me ofspecial Importance:-(i)   The war has brought into relief the extent towhich we are at present dependent on Foreign sources forsupply of petroleum, and especially upon America, fromwhich we were compelled to draw about 80 per cent of our.war requirements,   A continuance of this situation isclearly most undesirable.
(ii)     In order to modify this dependence &quot;upon America,Lord Harcourtls Committee devoted much time and labour tothe framing of the agreement with the Royal Dutch-ShellGroup, which has been approved by the Cabinet.   Thisagreement, however, is closely connected with satisfactoryarrangements being arrived at with the French.(iii) The French are as determined as ourselves toreduce their dependence on foreign-controlled supplies ofoil.   They have also been in close touch with the RoyalDutch-Shell Group, and it seems far better to come to anunderstanding with them than to have them as competitors.Our interests and theirs are also closely inter-relatedin Roumania and Galicia, and in Algeria, where the Pearsoninterests have been at work , for some time, and there isalso the question of way-leaves for pipe-lines from Persiaand Mesopotamia to the Mediterranean,(iv) The French are inexperienced in petroleummatters, and if they do not link up with us are certainto turn, to the United States for assistance.(v) It appears to me that under the agreementwe are not paying a high price for the advantages to besecured from French co-operation.   As regards Mesopotamiaespecially, the proposed French participation in thefclesopotamian Company is not to exceed 20 per cent, andwould probably not exceed 18 per cent, in return for whichwe should obtain the immense benefit of cheap transportfor two great producing companies which will remain underpermanent British control.3.     I recommend therefore that ratification of theAgreement be proceeded with and completed.
liu.  EXPORT   OF   OIL   FROM   SOUTH   RUSSIA.1.     The First Lord of the Admiralty when in chargeof the Petroleum Department had under considerationarrangements for securing export of Petroleum from SouthRussiaThese were submitted&apos; to the Cabinet on the 19thlovember, but it was decided (Minute No0 ?) that they shouldbe postponed and brought forward again when I had had theopportunity of looking, into them.2.     I have held a Conference with the Departments andinterests concerned in the matter and submit the fiiluwingproposals which differ in some particulars from those whichwere put forward by the First Lordr3.-   I will briefly recapitulate the advantages whichwould accrue if export of oil from South Russia could bearranged for:-(i) . In&apos;the interests of South Russia and Trans-CauCasia it Is vitally important that exports should berestarted from&apos;those areas.     Imports of every class ofmanufactured article are urgently required and can onlyb^ paid for by exports.     There are strong local objectionsto the export of grain owing to the shortage of food in thetoTfns but similar objections clearly do not arise in thecase of oil&quot;     The producers, on the other hand, wouldwelcome arrangements being made for export since transportinto the interior of Russia is not available, and ourinformation is that the reservoirs both in the Baku andGrosny fields are full to overflowing.(ii) One of the chief obstacles in the way of re-opening trade between the United Kingdom and the BlackSea littoral is the difficulty of securing exports topay for goods sent from this country.    If exports ofoil could be restarted, something at any rate, would
have been done to remove this difficulty,(iii)   Owing to our present exchange position inrolation to;1 the United States, it Is manifestly of greatadvantage to secure oil from other areas,4,     The two areas concerned are the Baku region inAzerbaijan and the Grosny area further north within Denikin1scountry.     They can be treated therefore as quite distinctpropositions.      Balm oil is shipped from Batoum which isconnected with Balm both by rail and by pipeline,     Grosnyis on the Vladikavkas railway and the oil has to be taken byrail to Novorossisk.5.     The &quot;Shell&quot; Group are prepared to take up thebusiness and no question of any cost being thrown uponH.ivi, Government Is involved.     I am informed that in bothfields the producers have formed themselves into an Associ-ation or Soviet with whom it would be easy for the &quot;Shell&quot;Group to make arrangements for purchase.     The principaldifficulty in both cases is one of transport to the port,When the oil is once at the port^ the &quot;Shell&quot; Group wouldarrange for its removal by tank steamers and for its disposalin the various markets of the world,6.     The transport question is complicated by thestate to which the Russian railways have now been reduced;As regards the Baku field, it is probable that the greaterpart of the oil would have-to reach Batoum through thepipeline.     It would greatly assist operations if an officerof not less rank than a Major General could be despatched toBatoum to supply the necessary prestige and Influence withRussian officials connected with the pipeline and with rail-ways transport.     There is no question of any military forcebeing involved;   the officer would merely be accompanied bythe necessary personal staff.    All expenses would be borne
Hamar greenwood.by &quot;Shell&quot; Group.     I understand that the War Officewould have no objection.7..     As regards the transport of oil from Grosny,the principal difficulty is the shortage of locomotivesand tank cars cn the Vladikavkas railway.     The &quot;Shell&quot;Group are prepared to purchase the necessary locomotives,some of which can be obtained at once from the UnitedStates, and also the required number of tank cars.     Theystipulate only that the British Railway Mission, which isgoing out to South Russia with Mr. Mackinder&apos;s PoliticalMission, should exercise all possible influence to preventthese locomotives and cars being diverted for otherpurpose^    I understand from Colonel Hull who has recentlyreturned from South Russia and who will be in charge ofthe Railway Mission, that his Mission will probably beable to do this effectively,n.     It will be observed that the proposals now putforward are on a*commercial basis, and involve a verysmall amount of Government intervention or responsibility.I should add that I propose to stipulate in my negotiationswith the &quot;Shell&quot; Group that the export of oil should beutilised as far as possible for the creation of credits herefor goods to be exported to Russia.9.     I would ask for the authority of the Cabinet toproceed on these lines.
