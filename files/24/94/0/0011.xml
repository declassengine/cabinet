THHS COMBINED FINANCIAL BIBTO OF CURRENTMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerI desire to call the attention of the Cabinet to thecombined financial effoet of current proposals in regard toOld Ago PensionsHealth InsuranceUnemployment Insurance,Several schemes hava been submitted andor each head andthese oould be combined In a great number of ways but Inorder to givo a oonorete idea of their general effect, I taketwo only.   On the one hand I disregard tho very expensiveschemes proposed by small groups of the Old Ago PensionsCommittee and on the other I leave out of account the Treasuryproposal for providing additional health insurance benefits-  -without any additional oharge on the State.   r7ith these cuali-fioations the two summaries beloi? practically represent thelesser and greater of the proposals submitted by Departments.M   JOWR ESTIMATE,Additional Cost Total weekly Con-to the State.    tributions by employ-Old Age Pensions,lo/- at 70; means limitdoubled.Health Insurance015/- )sieknessj7/Gd.dis-j,      ablemont 9lfe/6d)50/-mat6rn5 ty;dcotors Z0/GdoUnemployment Insurance.15/- )agriculturo &amp; domesticlE/6d)service excluded;State grant of onefourth -t 14,500,000	Men.	-Tom enEa400,000	10d.	, 9d,2,350,000		6d019,150,000	1/Bd.

State grant one third	5,700,000		TOTAL  33,700,000 l/ea,(If agriculture and domestic service are excluded in the lattercase the total cost is rcduood to  32,800,000 but the totalcontributions are raised to l/9-jrd. and l/5fl.TMany of the foregoing estimates are based on uncertaindata e.g, as to the effect of means limits on the number ofeligible old age pensioners and as to the ultimate outcomeof negotiations with the panel dootors,. hut special emphasisshould be laid upon a very doubtful assumption underlyingthe figures of the unemployment schemes.   These sohemoscontemplate the exclusion of certain &quot;segregated industries&quot; -among them some of the most important of the country,. e.g.coal mining and the cotton industry - which are called upon toprovide schemes of their own without any State contribution.If it is found necessary to provide the same proportion ofState subsidy for these industries as for those includedin the scheme, a large addition to the estimates will obviouslybe necessary,It will of course be realised that the estimates ofcost and the contributions must stand or fall togethor.If the public will not accept such high rates of contribu-tions as those proposed and it is decided to make up thedeficit from State funds), an additional  3,000,000 will borequired for eaeh reduction of Id, in the Health Insurancecontributions and of from  1,500,000 to  2,100,000 for a simi-lar reduction in unemployment contributions.Ho allowance was made for any of these increasedcharges in the u;hite Paper (Cmd. 376) on the Future ExchequerBalance Sheet,     Their cost in a normal year will thereforehave to be met by increased taxation.    As an indication ofthe magnitude of the taxation involved I would mention&apos;that Id,on the Income Tax is estimated to produce  4,300,000 and l/-a barrel extra beer duty about, 1,250,000.(Intd.)
