-   *A Conference was held at 3 p.m. on Ba-turday 29thNovember, 1919 at the Board of Trade to consider&apos; -th^-meat,sitaa tion.There were presentKt.Hon.Sir A.Geddes, K.C.B., M.P.Prei&amp;ent of the Boardof Trade (in the Chair)Rt.Ion.Lord Lee of tfareham, President of the Board ofAgriculture and Fisheries.,Mr.C.A.UcCurdy, I\I.P., Parliamentary Secretary, Ministryof Pood.Sir A J).Hall, K.C.B.

Practically all the cold storage spece isfull, and vessels containing 60,00C tons of meat are atpresent being discharged, awaiting discharge or just about     mto arrive.   The position is growing worse rather thanbetter and there is a danger of a largo amount of meatbeing wasted.    Meat due to arrive in December is 70,000tons and in Jtavwy 65,000 tons whereas the monthly con-sumption up to tho end of June is put&quot;, at 4-7,000 tons andat present it is beneath   the average.   As&apos;against thisaverage consumption of imported meat, available suppliesup to the end of June come to 75,000 tons a month .un   The congestion as regards imported meat is partly dueto/usually large supplies of home grown meat now comingforward.   There is a scarcity of fodder and feeding stuffsand prices are abnormally high, Farmers are therefore sofar as possible pushing their cattle on to the market duringthe autumn in order to save expense.   The Government have&quot;undertaken to purchase mature beasts at guaranteed prices.All that it has been possible for the government to do inthe direction of holding back supplies of home grown meatunder existing conditions is to restrict shipments fromIreland, and to see that greater care is exercised in refusingany but mature beasts.   On account- of the competition offrozen meat %t has been necessary to put some home grown meetinto store, and to sell low grade cow meat produced from home1-/cattle at the price of 4d. per lb.If control were removed it would be necessary to oom-pensate farmers for foregoing the advantages offered by theGovernment guarantee. &apos;A scheme of compensation has been drawnup involving an out of pocket expenditure not exceeding 2,000 to the Exchequer, in addition to a sum of about 3,000,000 which is in hand under the system by which meatis sold at flat prices throughout the year notwithstandingthat it is-bought on the whole at lower prices in the autumnthan in the spring. - * -
It was considered that this expenditure would bo wo 11worth while particularly as it would tend to roducothe fear of a shortage in supplies of homo grown meatduring the year 1920.   Unclor the scheme of compensationfarmers would coaso to be tied to particular markets,and the premium at present paid by them on the sale ofhides would no longer be collocted, while they would bapaid a premium up to x.1 per head per month in respectof cattle held back from the markot.   Ho compensationwould, however, be payable if the oattle were finallysold at or above the price guaranteed by the Government,It is thought that farmers will be willing to acceptsome offer on these or similar lines.Another factor aggravating the present glut ofimported meat is the slow rate of consumption, as corn-pared with the rate of   consumption before the war *   Thepresent woekly consumption is estimated to be only22,500 tons compared with SO,000 tons before the war, i,eto have fallen by 25 per cent.   So some extent no doubthigh prices are responsible, but it is probable that thesystem under which consumers are registered with par-ticular butchers is an oven more important cause, forcompetition between butchers is oliminatod; they havenot the same motive as in ordinary times to induce taapublic to buy and tend to make it a matter of favourrather than a matter, of business to supply meat,   In somodistricts, moreover, transport difficulties are causinga shortage of meat in the retail shops.   It is thoughtthat removal of Government control would be followed bya substantial increase in the amount o: meat consumed,^t was felt that it would be impossible, in view of thelarge supplies, to keep meat scarce and dear in order tosavo a lo;s on the Government guarantee.After lengthy discussion it was finally decided torecommond to the Cabinet as follows:-li That all control of meat should be abolishedat an early date .It was thought by -tho Klin is try of Pood thatIt would be impossible   to remove the control beforeDecember gist; but the President of the Board ofTrade was anxious that an earlier date should bedecided upon if possible.2. That a scheme of compensation acceptable tothe farmers should be arranged with thorn.3. That all export restrictions on live-stock,fexcluding milch-cows) and meat (including cannedand preserved meat) should be removed, exceptingthe restrictions on bacon with regard to which theMinistry .of ?ood was unable to give an immediateopinion, but which they undertook to have examined.
