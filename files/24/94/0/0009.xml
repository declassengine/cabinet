0 /\ f ITfrig&apos; Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]I WAS asked the other day in Cabinet for an apercu of the situation in theBaltic States, with reference more especially to German penetration and ambitions.d&apos;:)   Arising out of this is the scarcely less important question of their relations toRussia.The following resume has been prepared in the Foreign Office and is circulated in fulfilment of my undertaking.C. of K.Foreign Office, November 21, 1919.The Baltic States and Germany.THE aims of Germany or of the German forces in the Baltic States have their rootsin history, and are so dependent on the political aspirations of those small Statesthat any attempt to assess the situation as regards the Germans must cover what may at first appear irrelevant matter. A brief sketch of what these States are; an indica-tion of their present political conditions; and, most important of all, their relation-ship to Russia, are an essential preliminary to investigating the motives of theGerman occupation.
Brief Sketch of Ethnographical Divisions.1. The Baltic States, forming the fringe between Central Russia and the Baltic,differ in race and religion from the Russians. The population of Esthonia, the mostnortherly, is akin to the Finns, and is Lutheran in religion. The Letts andLithuanians are of Indo-European stock, but not Slav. The former are Lutherans, thelatter are Catholics, and this religious division is of considerable political importance.The populations. are, roughlv: Esthonia, 1,500,000; Latvia, 2,500,000; andLithuania, 5,000,000.The Baits are a most important element of their population. The famous ornotorious Baltic Barons are the descendants of the Teutonic Knights. They areGerman in name and in character, big landowners, with their estates mainly inCourland, and held high positions under the Tsarist regime. It is they who werelargely responsible for the German character of the old Russian Court. Now thatTsarism has fallen they exhibit two different tendencies: the first, to coalesce withEast Prussia and become an outpost of Germany; the second, to set up an indepen-dent Baltentum out of the Baits in all three States, taking no account of the nativepopulations. In other words, they aim at the creation of a single Baltic State.There is, however, a small Bait bourgeoisie which is disposed to go with theindividual nationalist movements and accept Esthonian or Lettish citizenship, asthe case may be. The Baits generally constitute 3 per cent, of the population ofEsthonia and 7 per cent, of Latvia.(ii.)Political A spirations of the Individual States.Since 1905 the claims of the Baltic States for autonomy have been mildly pressedin successive Dumas, but with the advent of the Bolshevists in November 1917 theyboldly made their bid for complete independence.The Baltic States were completely overrun by the German army in December1917, and so they remained until the Armistice. In May 1918 His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment granted provisional recognition to the Esthonian National Council as a de factoindependent body. The recognition of Latvia followed in November 1918 in similarterms, and Lithuania was. added to the list in September 1919.;(m.)Internal Situation in the Several States.-(a.) Lithuania.Lithuania is in much the worst position of the three Baltic States. The Lithu-anian Government only controls the old Russian Government of Kovno and part ofthat of Suwalki, while the Germans are in occupation of Schawli, together with aforce of Russians, and the Poles hold the rest, together with Vilna.The army, under the command of General Zhukovsky, numbers only 12,000 fullyequipped men and another 12,000 without equipment. What equipment itpossesses has been obtained from Germany.(b.) Esthonia.Esthonia is the only one of the three Baltic States which has had an opportunityof summoning a Constituent Assembly. This Assembly met on the 23rd April. Itsfirst act was the formation of a Coalition Government containing representativesfrom the three most important parties, with which lately there has been a good dealof dissatisfaction owing to the bad food distribution. The moral of the army has beenweakening, and it is this, together with the agitation of the Labour Party in the Diet,which has led to the opening of peace negotiations with the Soviet Government.
(c.) Latvia,.The present Lettish Government, with Ulmanis as Prime Minister and Meiroviczas Minister for Foreign Affairs, was formed in the beginning of July at Riga afterthe evacuation of the town by the Germans. There are two Bait representatives, andone Jew.The chief interest of the country is in (1) the evacuation of the Germans, (2) thepeace negotiations with the Bolshevists. The main difficulty in the negotiations withthe Bolshevists will be the fact that the latter occupy the whole of Lattgalia, thewestern portion of the Russian Government of Vitebsk. In spite of the desire forpeace on the part of the Lettish population, there would be very strong opposition tocoming to terms with the Soviet Government unless the latter agree to hand overLattgalia.The Lettish army probably numbers about 16,000, under Colonel Ballod, and isvastly inferior in numbers to the German forces in Latvia under von der Goltz andthe Russian forces under Colonel Bermondt, the latter alone being reported tonumber about 10,000.B.Relations between the Baltic States and Russia.(a.) Anti-Bolshevist Russians.The attitude of each of the three Baltic States towards the anti-BolshevistRussians has remained the same. Each of them has put in its demand for completeindependence, and the Delegation of each State at the Paris Conference has refusedto discuss the position with the Russian National Committee in Paris. They alldecline to accept any guarantees from the representatives of Kolchak and Denikin,though they do not exclude the possibility of federation with a future democraticRussia on their own terms. No means have been found for bringing them into closerrelations with the anti-Bolshevist Russians, whom they fundamentally distrust, andtheir recent experience of Russo-German intrigues in the Baltic has alienated themstill further.In the exchange of notes between Kolchak and the Allied Governments theformer, on the 4th July, guaranteed &quot; as from the present time the autonomy of thevarious nationalities,&quot; but that the limits and conditions of such autonomy wouldbe &quot; settled differently as regards each of the nationalities concerned.&quot; He further,agreed to &quot; have recourse to the collaboration and good offices of the League of Nations&quot;with a view to arriving at a satisfactory settlement.&quot; These conditions wereaccepted by the Allies, but refused by each of the Baltic States.The Esthonians have had closer relations with the anti-Bolshevist Russians thaneither the Letts or the Lithuanians. In Esthonia the main body of the Russians,under General Yudenitch, has been fighting the Bolshevists, and there have beenfrequent negotiations between the Esthonian Government and Yudenitch, who him-self recognises Admiral Kolchak. Though a temporary political agreement wasreached between the North-Western Russian Government, of which Yudenitch wasa member, nothing came of it. as the Allies refused to ratify it. Thus at the presentmoment the agreements between the two parties are purely of a military nature.The Letts and the Lithuanians have had no negotiations with the Russians. TheRussian forces on their territories have been equipped by the Germans, and remainin close touch with them, and the one desire of both the Lettish and LithuanianGovernments is that all the Russian forces should be evacuated as speedily as possible.(&amp;.) The Soviet Government,The three Governments of the Baltic States, while refusing to co-operate withthe Russian Whites against the Reds in a campaign into Russia, had up till recentlydeclined to come to any terms with the Soviet Government.On the 31st August the Soviet Government made the first move, offering peace onconditions which the Esthonian Government decided were worth considering.Subsequently a conference of the Baltic States and Finland met at Dorpat fromthe 29th September to the 1st October. It was then agreed that the Baltic Statesshould act conjointly, and that Finland should be invited to join up if she could.
Other points included recognition of the sovereign independence of the Baltic Statesand the formation of a neutral zone between the Bolshevists and the Baltic peoples.It had, moreover, been previously decided that the Entente should be asked for theirviews on the whole question of peace. As far as His Majesty&apos;s Government wereconcerned, a reply was sent on the 25th September to the effect that, as Great Britaincould not supply further arms or ammunition, they must leave the Baltic States fullliberty of action in this matter. At the same time an assurance was given that whenthe final status of the new States was decided by the Peace Conference or the Leagueof Nations &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government will exert such influence as they may possessto secure the satisfaction of the legitimate aspirations of Esthonia, Latvia, and Lithu-ania, so far as may be consistent with a final and peaceful settlement in North-EastEurope.&quot;At this point the remarkable advance of General Yudenitch on Petrograd andthe simultaneous attack of the Russo-German forces on Riga caused the suspensionof the negotiations. We must now expect, however, their early resumption, and evenif Latvia and Lithuania do not at present see their way to join, it is probable thatEsthonia will accept the offer of separate peace which has just been made to her bythe Soviet Government.C.The German and Russian Forces in the Baltic States.No exact figures of the German forces in the Baltic are forthcoming, but they aresupposed to amount to anything between 40,000 and 100,000. General Gough was ofOpinion when he left that General von der Goltz could at a stretch construct an armyof six divisions. These Germans have been largely dissipated throughout the twosouthern States, but the main concentration has been in Courland. Since their recentcapture of Riga the Germans have taken no further part in the fighting against theBolshevists.   General von der Goltz has been replaced by General von Eberhardt.The Russian forces in the Baltic are mainly formed out of the Russian prisonersof war from Germany, and have been equipped and financed by private associationsin Berlin (see E). Apart from General Yudenitch, their principal commanders havebeen Colonel Rodzianko and Colonel Arsenyev, both of these being definitely underYudenitch and with him in the north-western army; Prince Lieven, with ColonelBermondt, in Courland; and Count von Keller, with Colonel Yirgolich, in Lithuania.Prince Lieven and Count von Keller are both Baltic Barons. Colonel Bermondt, whois a Caucasian and whose real name appears to be Avaloff, is by far the most activeof these officers. His headquarters are at Mitau, in Latvia, while those of Virgolich,who is trying to rival Bermondt in activity, are at Schwali, in Lithuania.The relationship between these German and Russian forces is very tangled. Ofthe two commanders with Yudenitch, Rodzianko is pro-Ally and Arsenyev is pro-German. Yudenitch has so far unless our information is defective remainedloyal to the Allies, though Arsenyev and others have tried and are still trying to bringhim over to the German side. Bermondt and Virgolich, on the other hand, areavowedly pro-German, and a large element in their forces is actually German, thoughthey are dressed as Russians. The number of Germans m Courland is uncer-tain; in Lithuania they are reported to number 2,000, and it is said that another 2,000are on their way from Germany.The Russian forces in Courland and Lithuania are equipped and paid by theGermans. They make no secret of the fact that they look to Germany to restoreRussia from the Bolshevists, and they treat the Letts and Lithuanians with ill-disguised hostility. If, however, the Russians could be separated from theGermans the majority might be quite willing to leave Courland and join Yudenitchon the north-west front.D.German Action in the Baltic States since the Armistice.By the terms of the Armistice (paragraph 12) &quot;all German troops at present interritories which before the war formed part of Russia must return to within thefrontiers of Germany as soon as the Allies shall think the moment suitable, havingregard to the internal situation of these territories.&quot;  At the time of the Armistice
the Allies had formed no plan for supporting the Baltic States other than employingany troops that were on the spot to protect them against the Bolshevists. The firststep taken by the Germans, however, was to prevent the organisation of the newBaltic States. The easiest method of attaining this end was to hand over the countryto the Bolshevists. No doubt the disorganisation of the German troops was partlythe natural result of the German defeat and the German revolution, but there wasmethod in the madness, for as the German troops began to retire from the occupiedprovinces they handed over their military material to the Bolshevists, and it wasowing to this sudden help that the latter quickly overran Esthonia, and at the end ofDecember were within a few miles of Eeval. A large part of Latvia and Lithuaniawere also overrun by the Germans.The Esthonians were the first to recover, and, helped by Finnish volunteers andafterwards by British war material, they succeeded in driving the Bolshevists fromtheir country in the beginning of February. The Letts and Lithuanians were not sosuccessful, as large numbers of Germans still remained in their country, and their&apos;contact with the Allies was not so close.General von der Goltz arrived at Libau towards the end of February, and soonhad 20,000 Germans with a small force of Baits under his command. Germanactivities were at first concentrated on Latvia, which was the least organised of thenew States. The first step was the overthrow of the National Lettish Governmentunder Ulmanis and the establishment of a nominally Lettish Government underNeedra, which was really controlled by the Bait Landeswehr and German soldiers.The next step was the capture of Riga from the Bolshevists, and the execution of asmany Letts as possible on the plea that they had been aiding the Bolshevists.Meanwhile, the Germans had not been hindered by the Allies to any appreciableextent, but the rapidity of the German advance forced the Paris Conference to act.The Allied authorities in Riga succeeded in putting a stop to the executions carriedout by the Bait Landeswehr under a certain Major Fletcher, a German, and in June,when the Germans and Baits began to threaten the Esthonians, who had been joinedby a small force of Letts, Marshal Foch, acting for the Paris Conference, sent anultimatum to the German Government demanding the evacuation of the Germantroops. By this time the British Military Mission, under General Gough, hadarrived, and, through his agency, a truce was concluded on the 3rd July between theEsthonians and the Letts on the one hand and the Germans and Baits on the other.Up till this time the Germans had had it practically their own way, but once theBritish Military and Political Missions set to work matters seemed to improve. TheGermans evacuated.Libau on the 25th June and Riga on the 6th July, and a few dayslater a new Lettish Government, under Ulmanis, returned to Riga.German policy now underwent a new phase. German troops were transferredas rapidly as possible from the German divisions to the Baltic Landeswehr, and closerelations were established with Russian forces which were beginning to arrive fromGermany (see C).General von der Goltz met all demands from the Allied Governments for theimmediate evacuation of the German troops first with one excuse, then with another,at one time bringing forward the plea that the Lettish Government had promised theGerman soldiers land in recognition of their services against the Bolshevists, atanother time pleading that time was needed before the evacuation could be carriedout.Finally, under German pressure a bogus Russian West Government was set upin Berlin last October, and Bermondt and von der Goltz moved up and attacked Riga.The Supreme Council at once addressed a further note to the German Govern-ment through the Armistice Commission insisting on the fulfilment of its previouscommands, and at the same time suspending certain negotiations then in progressfor the supply of food and raw materials and financial facilities for Germany. Thesenegotiations are still suspended, and the Germans are not getting the raw materialpending the evacuation of the Germans from the Baltic. An Inter-Allied MilitaryMission under General Niessel is now on its way to control measures of evacuation onthe spot in concert with the German Government. Six notes in all demanding evacua-tion have been despatched to the German Government through Marshal Foch sinceJune.[1499]C
E.The Aims of Germany in the Baltic States.With these facts set out, the main questions at issue can now be discussed,namely: (a) How far is the German Government involved in the action of theGerman forces in the Baltic ?   (&amp;) What are the German aims ?With regard to (a) our information is certainly not sufficient to implicate theGerman Government as a whole. &apos; The latter have ostensibly given all the informationat their disposal to the Niessel Mission, but, according to General Malcolm, there isa great deal going on behind the back of the German Government, or at least behindthe back of Noske, who is believed to be genuinely trying to play straight and carryout the Peace contract. But he has had to employ many of the officials of the oldregime in the departments under him, and there are a large number of them in theGerman War Office who are signing their names and putting the War Office stampon orders and secret instructions of which Noske knows nothing, e.g., the movementorders to the various reinforcements, German and Russian, which have been leavingBerlin for the Baltic at midnight two or three times a week. But Noske dealspromptly with, a good proportion of the offenders whenever he finds them out. Theseofficials are clearly acting as agents of various Conservative associations who arehoping to be the instruments of a Russian reaction, and who look to General von derGoltz, himself a thorough-going reactionary, as their leader. The latter iscompletely out of hand, and is in constant communication with Bermondt and withBischoffsky, who is the Russian moving spirit in Berlin.The financing of the German-Russian forces is undertaken by a number ofGerman financial firms, chiefly.the Deutsche Schwerer Industrie and the Schilde con-sortium in Berlin, while Krupp is playing a considerable role in supplying equipmentand material. The following are instances of the activities of those firms which havecome to our notice.It appears that the Deutsche Schwerer Industrie put enough money into Ber-mondt on October 1 to last him for six weeks, and simultaneously a wave ofRussianism swept over Germany. In the meantime Virgolich, who had originallystarted as a purely aMi-Russian-Bohhevist, collected his Russian officers and troopson the understanding that they should operate against the Russian Bolshevists only.He collected for this purpose between 4.000 and 5,000 men; of his officers, two-thirdswere Russians, and of his men two-thirds were Germans. His money, however, ranout at the end of September, at the same time as Bermondtfs; but, unlike Bermondt,he failed to raise fresh funds in Berlin. Thereupon Bermondt, who, as just stated,was more successful and had got money from the Deutsche Schwerer Industrie (andalso from Swedish sources), bought him in exchange for his support. As soon asVirgolich&apos;s Russian officers realised what had happened they tried to break awayfrom him, and this is the original cause of the movement which has lately beenreported to us, namely, that a considerable proportion of his forces are- anxious tojoin Yudenitch. The last information is that as many as 1,000 men are trying tomake their way to him via Jacobstadt. It is believed that all the best Russianelements in Bermondfs army would follow suit if they were given any encouragementor knew how to get up to Yudenitch. As, however, Yudenitch&apos;s army will now beforced to disarm and disappear from Esthonia in the face of the impending conclu-sion of peace between the Esthonians and the Bolshevists, the migration ofBermondt&apos;s Russians to Yudenitch will cease to be a practical question.Again, as regards Krupp&apos;s part in the business, it appears that since the Armis-tice he has apparently bought back from the German Government enormous quan-tities of war material of all sorts. The bulk of this he has used for keeping hisfactories going by converting it into agricultural implements, &amp;c. But in the middleof September he still found himself with a good deal of surplus material which hadto &quot;vanish &quot; by the time peace was ratified, presumably by the middle of November.Much of this he handed over to Bermondt, and supplemented it with money in returnfor future concessions in the Baltic and in Russia. Since Bermondt failed he hasopened up negotiations with Denikin&apos;s agent in Berlin on the same lines. He isoperating through the Schilde consortium in Berlin, and has got one of his representa-tives in Schilde&apos;s office. His lead in backing these operations and the temporarysuccesses of the three Russian leaders caused, the Germans to wake up to the factthat their only hope of salvation lies in building themselves up on Russia, i.e., gettingtheir raw material from Russia and even subsequently utilising Russian man-poweragainst France.
The Germans are divided financially into two camps: the business men on theRhine whose factories are working (thanks to the occupation) are all looking west-ward ; the rest of Germany is all looking east. The Germans realise that, when thevaluta is against any country, though individuals can quite easily buy in the moreexpensive market, the national wealth can only be righted by buying in a cheapermarket, i.e., for Germany in Russia. There was an astonishing rush a few weeksago to offer money to any Russian proposition, not only in Berlin, but in Dresden,Munich, &amp;c, but the speculators had a bad set-back by the Yudenitch and Bermondtfiasco. Now it looks as though the Germans, or at all events the Krupp group, willmake a serious bid to get in with Denikin.This all gives a picture, however fragmentary, of the trend of opinion amongcertain political and business circles in Germany towards Russia. It seems fairlyclear that the support of the Baltic venture comes from private associations and netfrom the Government, who are, perhaps, ready, though impotent, to check it. Thelatter would no doubt be glad if it succeeded, but they have quite enough on theirhands to risk a foreign enterprise which would easily bring them down.Nevertheless, pressure put on the Government as such especially if it is of thekind likely to affect the firms who have been speculating on Russia, such as the with-holding of raw material, which is what we are now doing ought not to be ineffective&apos;in stimulating them (the Government) to be more stringent in stopping money andsupplies to the German and Russo-German forces in the Baltic. The danger is thatby creating discontent in Germany we make their position more unsteady than it isand risk a convulsion which might result either in a reactionary coup d&apos;etat or aSpartacist outbreak.The Germans in the Baltic are, however, evidently impervious to admonitionsfrom Berlin, and, though they may be reduced to standing still through lack of sup-plies, they show no signs of allowing themselves to be actually dislodged except by thedirect use of force. On the contrary, it is reported that fresh instalments of men arestill arriving from Germany. They are said to. be largely composed of men who havelost everything through the war, of dispossessed Alsace-Lorrainers, and of soldiersof fortune who have severed all ties with Germany and want to make their futuresabroad. The only army that could be employed against them is the Polish army, andthere are patent objections to adopting that expedient. Moreover, there are nowindications that Polish-German hostility is dying down, and the Polish troops mightquite easily resent an attempt by the Allies to use them against the Germans. Theyrecognise that they have got to live alongside Germany long after the Baltic questionhas been settled.Accordingly the application of force is not seriously within the range of practicalpolitics, and unless, therefore, the German Government are prepared, under economicpressure from us, and able to stop the despatch of supplies and reinforcements totheir Baltic forces, and so immobilise the latter on the spot, we shall be obliged toadmit our entire impotence to modify the situation. General von Eberhardt, who hassucceeded General von der Goltz, for the ostensible purpose of effecting the evacua-tion, is every bit as deliberately obstructive as his predecessor. But he is not ad&apos;Annunzio, and, in fact, there being no question of Irredentism in this case, Germanywill neither be made delirious by the success nor&apos; shaken to her foundations by thefailure of the Baltic enterprise. Our hope is, therefore, that the moderate parties inGermany, the Centre and the Majority Socialists, who are genuinely^ we are told,averse to new adventures abroad, will eventually so dominate the internal Germansituation that the reactionary and imperialist parties and the speculators on Russiawill find it increasingly difficult to play a game of their own.(b.) To state in a single definition the object of the German enterprise in the Baltic,or the aims of its various authors, is difficult with the insufficient data at our disposal.There must clearly be present to the minds of the subscribers a general sense of oncemore promoting Deutschtum abroad, but there can hardly at this point be a real con-sensus of opinion as to how that is to be done. For&quot;the majority of the troopsemployed, officers as well as men, colonisation is the main end in view. They havealready taken root in the country where they have been engaged, and have becomemore colonists than fighting troops. For instance, they have taken over and havebecome shareholders in many of the Lettish sawmills, and are sending into Germanylarge quantities of milk and food of all descriptions, for which they receive no pay-ment actually in the Baltic States, but for which they or their families receive pay-ment in Germany. As much as 37 million marks&apos; worth of goods are stated to havebeen thus imported into Germany last month without payment going out. It hasalready been mentioned that a large proportion of von der Goltz&apos;s army are men
rendered homeless through the war. To them, therefore, the expedition has offered anew chance in life, and, far from being the conscious vanguard in the new Aufmarschim Osten, all they ask is to be left alone and become harmless settlers in a fairlyhospitable land.There remains, however, the aim of von der Goltz, Eberhardt, and their like, bothon. the spot and in Germany, and there can be little doubt that for them the ultimate&apos;goal is the Germanisation of Russia, which will be brought about by utilising everyforce, every motive, every need of the German who is seeking fresh fields for migra-tion or expansion.    There are long gaps in the Baltic-Bolshevist front lines, andduring the last year it is certain that large numbers of Germans have been swarmingthrough.   Whether these men are Spartacists or not does not matter; it is a wisercreed for them, and, indeed, we have heard only within the last week of a GermanSoviet in Russia.   What matters is that, from the great jumping-off ground of ahalf Germanised Latvia, only Germans have been free to make their way across thefrontier into the interior,   It is generally predicted that when the veil is eventuallylifted from Soviet Russia the whole country will be found dotted with German farmsand settlements and Germans well ahead in the race for trade.   These people will&apos; rapidly shed their Spartacist colouring and supply the human material necessary forrebuilding Russia in German form.   This will apply equally whether the rebirth ofRussia is brought about by transformation from within or by salvation from without.In any case it is obviously the game of the German parties that place on the forefrontof their programme the conversion of Russia into a German colony, to have their menon the spot ready for all emergencies that the future may throw up.   The Germans,,as neighbours, not as psychologists, understand the Russians better than we do, and,what is worse, the age-long tendency of the Russians to turn to the Germans forstatecraft shows no signs of diminution.In conclusion, the relations between the Baltic peoples and their two big neigh-bours needs a short notice in estimating the prospects of the Germans on the territoryof the former. The existing relations between the Baltic States and Russia havebeen already sketched (see B). But they are even now in process of change, like every-thing else in Eastern Europe. The cleavage between all the border States and theanti-Bolshevist Russians is now almost a fait accompli. Since the Esthonians &quot; letQAaMaJm, L down&quot; Yudenitch over the Petrograd^there is little hope of averting the&apos; ultimate revenge of the All-Russians against the little States. It is significant thatLettish and Lithuanian battalions with German commanders have recently beenobserved on the Bolshevist front against Denikin. Have the Baltic States definitelydecided that their fate depends on the defeat of the anti-Soviet forces that it is nowa matter of life and death for them \ They are working in increasingly close con-junction with Finland and Poland. Will they succeed in bringing about a combina-tion of Border States the cordon sanitaire at last? If so-, this cordon sanUaire willnow be not against Bolshevist Russia, but against anti-Bolshevist Russia, for peacebetween the States and the Soviet is almost aforegone conclusion. In this case will it&apos; eventually involve a German orientation in the policy of those States ? It is largelyup to us to prevent it. The Baltic States, having finally cast the die, will need atleast moral protection against an unfavourable turn in the wheel of fortune. If theyfail to get it from us they are bound to turn some day to Germany, and the founda-tions that Germany is laying now will then stand her in good stead.November 15, 1919.o
