Wl MEMORANDUMon&quot; ^ifflPGlIl^S OF ROYALIST SCHEMES AND SECRET MILITARY PREPARA-TIONS IN GERMANY: THE SO-CALLED SPECIAL POLICE FORCES.SOME of the newspapers, particularly the &quot; Times&quot; (19th November, p. 12,columns 1 and 2), have recently been publishing news and comments to the effect thata reactionary royalist movement is in full swing in Prussia, that it is being engineeredby officers of the German Army, and that- military forces far beyond what is allowedby the terms of the Armistice and the Treaty of Peace are still being maintained inGermany with a view to&apos; internal reaction and eventually to aggression against theAllies. The demonstrations on the occasion of Hindenburgs visit to Berlin as awitness before the Commission of Enquiry into the origin and conduct of the Avar areadduced as a proof of the reactionary spirit prevailing among the officers of the Armyand among certain sections of the population. At the same time, it is asserted that&quot; there are now some 700,000 men under arms in Germany&quot; *.; and to these there isapparently added an estimated armed force of 300,000 men belonging to the &quot; SpecialPolice&quot; which has recently been organised in the large towns, &quot;ostensibly&quot; as aprotection against internal disorder, looting, and crimes against life and property.&quot; In well-informed quarters it is stated that the army formed by General von der Goltzin the Baltic Provinces .... is merely the nucleus of a much larger force which hasbeen secretly organised in the interior of Germany in readiness for whatever action themilitary party may decide upon.&quot;In the &quot; Times &quot; of the 20th November (p. 12, column 3) the statement made inthe issue of the previous day that &quot; there are now 1,000,000 men under armsin Germany &quot; is said to excite great interest in the House of Commons and somedisquietude.2. Regarding the numbers and organisation of the regular German forces, i.e.fthe new Army (Reichswehr), and regarding the gradual demobilisation of the old Armyand the forces now in Courland and in the German Eastern frontier districts, there islittle to add to what was said in the two memoranda submitted by the PoliticalIntelligence Department (Germany /040, 4th November, and /039, 30th October).These memoranda were largely based upon information received from the BritishMilitary Mission in Berlin through General Malcolm&apos;s reports. His reports gave noreason for doubting the substantial truth of the statement made by .the Minister for theDefence of the Empire (Noske) to the Budget Committee of the National Assembly tothe effect that the present strength of Germany&apos;s military forces was about 400,000men of whom 200,000 were in the interior and ^00,000 on or beyond the Easternfrontier and that it was rapidly diminishing. The new voluntary Army, orReichswehr, was to consist of 8,477 officers and 187,629 men, or altogether 196,006.With regard to the forces which were under Von der Goltz in Courland and arenow under General Eberhardt, the latest German news is that the Government is doingall it can to promote their evacuation. Bermondt&apos;s troops have been subordinated toGeneral von Eberhardt whatever that step may signify; and hospital trains andother comforts are being sent forward to meet them as they return &quot; on the assumptionthat they submit unconditionally to Eberhardt&apos;s orders. According to all accounts ofthe fighting with the Letts before Riga, Bermondt&apos;s forces must now be greatly in needof &quot; hospital trains and other comforts,&quot; and they are said to be seriously demoralised.It is well known that General von der Goltz and many of his officers regardedtheir troops as a nucleus of reaction, and the same belief accounts for the way in whicharmy officers in Germany sympathised with their recalcitrancy, and facilitated thesurreptitious despatch of supplies and reinforcements to them. The defeat ofBermondt by the Letts and the evacuation of the whole of the German forces, underconditions which the Inter-Allied Military Mission will supervise can hardly fail to[1635]* The &quot; Times.&quot; November 19, p. 12, column 1.B
frustrate any schemes which the reactionary military party has been building uponthese troops as a solid reactionary unit. General Niessel&apos;s Mission has left Berlin forthe Eastern frontier.The new Quasi-Military Organisations not Secret.3. As to the alleged secret military preparations in Germany, it may be pointedout that the Allied Military Missions are in a position to ascertain and report everythingthat takes place in the military sphere. General Malcolm has sent full accounts of the&quot; Special Police &quot; organisations, which appear to excite some alarm in newspaper andother circles in this country. It may be noted at the outset that no secret at all hasbeen made of these new armed police organisations in Germany. The German presshas contained full accounts of them, and in Berlin the Sicherheitspolizei had a field-day and marched through the streets with its complete equipment of machine-guns, &amp;c.The following is the gist of General Malcolm&apos;s information : -I. The Sicherheitspolizei, Police for Public Security, or, as General Malcolm rendersthe term, Armed Constabulary.Sicherheitspolizei under Ministry of Interior.The Sicherheitspolizei is under the Minister of the Interior. In Prussia the Ministerof the Interior, Heine (Majority Socialist) issued comprehensive instructions regardingthe appointment of officers and the enlistment of other ranks ; numerous recruitingappeals appear in the press.Organisation and equipment military.On the other hand, the organisation and equipment are military. The force inBerlin is armed with machine-guns and even with Minenwerfer. This is explicable inview of the fact that the successive Spartacist risings of last winter and spring wereconducted on the lines of civil war, and that the insurgents entrenched themselvesand garrisoned buildings which had to be taken by regular sieges and bombardments.Numbers.An order of the Prussian Minister of War, dated the 30th September (the officehas since been abolished), gave the provisional establishment of the Sicherheitspolizeiforces of the various towns in Prussia on the 1st September as follows : Town.	Officers.	Other Ranks.Berlin	321	6,828West German detachment for special employment	50	1,200(Abteilung Z.B.V.)		Breslau       ..          ..         ..      -   ..	48	1,200Hindenburg (Upper Silesia)	40	1,000Kattowitz	40	1,000Bochum                 ..         ..	40	1,000Geltfenkirchen	40	1,000Essen	40	1,000Konigsberg	40	1,000Hannover	27	676Magdeburg.	24	600Stettin	22	600    .Oassel	14	300Total..         ..         ..	746	16,904According to a number of other reports, the Berlin force is to be raised to 9,000,exclusive of officers.The West German force is apparently to be employed for service in the neutralzone.Press reports give the strength of the Sicherheitspolizei forces to be raised in thedifferent towns and districts as follows : 2,000 to 3,0003205,000 to 6,000 .5,8001102,550Danzig ..HamburgSaxony ..Wurttemberg-OfficersOther ranks
Estimates of Ultimate Strength.Other reports state that 300 Sicherheitspolizei will be raised for each 100,000inhabitants in the larger towns and that the establishment of the Sicherheitspolizeiforce is to be raised to (16,000 for the whole of Germany,Mr. Winthrop Bell, who has recently been sending excellent reports from Berlin,stated the other day in conversation that a total number of 400,000 Sicherheitspolizeiwas contemplated.   1 do not know on what data he bases this estimate.Corresponding Forces in Wurttemberg and Bavaria.In Wurttemberg and Bavaria the corresponding force is called the Polizeiwehr.All military terms have been discarded in the Polizeiwehr. The battalion is called&quot;Bann&quot; and a company is called a &quot;Schaar.&quot;Co-ordination in the Empire.The Sicherheitspolizei is under the orders of the Ministries of the Interior in thevarious States. For the affairs of the Sicherheitspolizei affecting all the States anorganising department has been established at the Ministry of the Interior of theEmpire. Enlistments in the Sicherheitspolizei are made through the commanders ofthat force in the various towns.German Military Opinion on Sicherheitspolizei.In Prussia, at any rate, the Sicherheitspolizei is organised on a military basis andis housed in barracks. Competent German military opinion seems to regard itentirely from the point of view of efficiency for the suppression of internal dis-tufbances. Thus, in a secret Army document which was recently published by theIndependent Socialists,* and which General Malcolm on internal evidence regards asgenuine, the new force is criticised as follows : &quot; It is being recognised more and more that a sufficiently strong and reliableArmy is the foundation-stone for the reconstruction of the country, for thecreation of discipline and of order, of work, and of bread. Sicherheitspolizei and .officials cannot replace the Army for any length of time. The suspicion isbecoming more and more marked that the Government will not take steps tokeep up an Army that by its strength and discipline can at least maintain orderin the interior. Naturally the worry regarding their own existence and thefeeling that they are being treated ungratefully and carelessly has a greatimportance as regards the discontent in the Army, but the movement is muchmore serious because it is founded on moral and patriotic motives. The averageman feels that the Government is not in a position to lead the people to bettertimes, and that the Government does not ask how many officers and soldiersspend their life&apos;s blood in fighting against rebellion, if only the working-manstriker, the &apos; Comrade of the Party,&apos; is not alienated. Often the soldier hifought in the streets in support of the Government, which never thanked him.&quot;Probable reasons of German Government for promoting Special Police Forces.It is perhaps legitimate to infer from the tone of this military remonstrance thatthe Government fears the unpopularity which the regular Army (Reichswehr) mayincur if it is used for the suppression of sporadic disorder, and that the object infounding the Sicherheitspolizei is to have another force of real military value which canbe used for that purpose.Another point is that the regular Army is being unified under the Ministry ofDefence of the Empire, and its territorial administration to a considerable extentabolished. But as was recently demonstrated, when the Communist regime wassuppressed in Munich by Prussian and other non-Bavarian troops, intervention fromoutside causes very great irritation. The Sicherheitspolizei on the other hand will bein important respects a territorial or rather a municipal organisation, and its local unitswill be used as a rule only in the towns where they have their garrison. Whether thescheme is a wise one and whether in the past the experience of Municipal Guards-inParis, for example is encouraging is another matter.* &quot; Freiheit,&quot; October 27,1919.[1635] B 2
BicJierheitspolizei in the Plebiscite Areas.   Polish Objections.A point which is particularly noteworthy is that Sicherheitspolizei is being raisedfor the plebiscite areas in East Prussia and Upper Silesia, for the free State of Danzig,and also for towns in the occupied area such as Cologne and Aix-la-Chapelle. ThePolish Government has already addressed a note verbale to His Majesty&apos;s Minister inWarsaw with regard to a report that the Inter-Allied Commission in Upper Silesia hadagreed to a German proposal that the Sicherheitspolizei should remain in the plebiscitearea of Upper Silesia after the Peace Treaty takes effect and the Inter-Allied troopshave occupied the area. The Polish Foreign Office calls attention to the danger thatthe presence of Sicherheitspolizei might prejudice the impartiality of the plebisciteboth in this area and in the former provinces of East and West Prussia. It is allegedthat Germany enlists in these formations only soldiers who have served four years withthe colours, including one year at the front, and that they are commanded by officersof the old Army. They have field guns, machine-guns, aeroplanes, trench mortars, andliquid-fire apparatus. According to the Poles, there are 4,000 of them in UpperSilesia,The answer to these representations is doubtless to be found in paragraph 1 of theAnnex to Section VIII of the Peace Treaty (Poland), where it is laid down with regardto the plebiscite area that &quot; within fifteen days from the coming into force of the presenttreaty .... all military and semi-military unions formed within tiie said area byinhabitants of the district shall be immediately disbanded.&quot; German troops and suchofficials as may be designated by the Inter-Allied Commission must evacuate theplebiscite area. The Commission &quot; shall take all steps which it thinks proper toensure the freedom, fairness and secrecy of the vote.&quot; It may &quot; order the expulsion ofany persons who may in any way have attempted to distort the result of the plebisciteby methods of corruption and intimidation &quot; ; and it, &quot; will maintain order with thehelp of the troops which will be at its disposal and to the extent which it may deemnecessary by means of gendarmerie recruited among the inhabitants of the country.&quot;II. The Einwohnerwehr (Civic Guards).Einwohnerwehr intended to safeguard property and life of citizens.Side by side with the Sicherheitspolizei, but organised on a civilian basis somewhatlike our special constables in time of emergency, is the Einwohnerwehr. It is a mistaketo say that secrecy has been maintained with regard to its organisation, as the&quot; Germania&quot; of the 20th October published a full account of it.* The Einwohnerwehrhas arisen, or at any rate has recommended itself to the citizens, owing to the insecurityof life and property which followed upon the revolutionary fighting at the close of1918 and in the early months of 1919. It is true that, as some of the German news-papers point out, the insecurity of property is largely due to the carelessness of thepopulation itself a result of the revolutionary mood. People often fail, to take ordinaryprecautions for safeguarding their property, and there has been a widespread credulitywhich often makes them the victims of all kinds of swindlers. The ordinary policehas its hands too full to be of help in emergencies, while the Sicherheitspolizei isintended to cope with organised disturbances on a larger scale. The Einwqhnerwehrare being organised by the local authorities (municipalities, district councils, &amp;c.) fromall classes of society which may be considered supporters of a democratic form ofgovernment.   The members are selected by &quot; Advisory Committees for Defence.&quot;To co-operate with Sicherheitspolizei in event of disturbances.It is intended that in the event of disturbances on a large scale the localEinwohnerwehr should co-operate with the Sicherheitspolizei and place itself under theorders of the police or the military authorities. Members must give a written pledgethat they are prepared to do this. Exercises in association with troops will bepractised.Armament.It is proposed that the Einwohnerwehr should be armed like the Sicherheitspolizeiwith carbines or rifles, and that they should have machine-guns attached to their units.The machine-guns are to be specially issued to parties formed for the protection of&apos;buildings such as factories, newspaper and printing offices, banks, and country/houses.Arms are only to be carried when the bearers are on duty.* Major-General Malcolm&apos;s Report, No. 26, dated October 24, 1919.
Some of the members are recruited for service within their commune only, othersundertake to serve within their wider government district or Kreis.A document issued&apos;by the central office of the Einwohnerwehr in Berlin urges theinhabitants to ascertain where the nearest alarm station of the Einwohnerwehr is to be&apos;found. In most of the Berlin suburbs there is a prearranged code for alarm calls.&quot;Only the personal initiative and self-defence of every individual inhabitant,&quot; saysthis appeal, &quot;is of any use in combating the sinister growth of criminality. The policecannot be everywhere at once. Therefore organise Einwohnerwehren everywhere, evenin the smallest communities ! Let every man join&apos; the Einwohnerwehr ! Only by doingthis can he safeguard his home, his family, his property.&quot;Einwohnerwehr under Ministry of Interior.The whole organisation has since the 1st November been placed under the Ministryof the Interior for the Empire. According to article 9 of the Constitution theorganisation of the new German police is the business of the Empire.Police to be unified for whole of Germany.The organisation of a homogeneous police for the whole of Germany is contem-plated, but, as has been seen in regard to the Wurttemberg Sicherheitspolizei, - it isbeing planned on lines which leave to the]individual States a considerable latitude oforganisation.III. The Zeitfreiwilligen.Zeitfreiwilligen a temporary organisation.Among the different minor organisations which sprang up for the protection oforder at the time of the revolutionary disturbances was that of the Zeitfreiwilligen orBeichswehr Reserves. Local appeals appear to have been issued by different regimentsinviting all patriotic soldiers who were unable to join the new army, the Reichswehr,to declare their readiness to join up &quot; in the eventuality of our having to take up armsonce again to maintain public order and security in our own country.....   No man whohands in his name becomes liable to any other obligation than that he would he calledto the colours should the situation make it absolutely necessary to fight againstdisorders in the interior.&quot; The Zeitfreiwilligen engage to serve until further notice,that is until the moment when the internal danger on account of which they have beencalled up has passed. After this critical&apos; period the Zeitfreiwilligen can terminatetheir engagement, but only after eight days&apos; notice.Now to be incorporated in the Einwohnerwehr.There is no information as to the number of Zeitfreiwilligen who responded tosuch appeals. But this organisation does not require further attention, as, accordingto the instructions issued for the Einwohnerwehr by the Ministry of the Interior, theZeitfreiwilligen and all similar organisations are &quot;forthwith to be incorporated in theEinwohnerwehren.&apos;&apos;Potential numbers of the Einwohnerwehr.We have no&quot; estimate of the total numbers of the Einwohnerwehr. Potentially,according to some observers on the spot, it might ultimately, if it became popular,attain a strength of hundreds of thousands.German War Office unconcerned in appointments.In Prussia both the Sicherheitspolizei and the Einwohnerwehr are undefthe Ministry of the Interior. The German Army orders of the 23rd October state thatthe Beichswehr Ministry (War Office of the Empire) and the military authorities haveno influence as to appointments in these forces. This announcement was necessitatedby the fact that numerous applications for appointments had been addressed to theBeichswehr Ministry.But militarist influences active.There is, nevertheless, information to the effect that the Einwohnerwehr has tosome extent come under the influence of reactionary and militarist elements and thatthe organisation of this force and appointments in it are largely controlled by Majorvon Haringen, who is himself reactionary and militarist.
The impression derived from the most trustworthy information which reaches this- -Department is that in all the various German forces the Reichswehr, the Sicherheits-polizei, the Einwohnerwehr, the temporary Zeitfreiwilligen, the various troops on thefrontier (Grenzsehutz) and beyond it in Courland and Lithuania the officer element islargely but not universally royalist and reactionary in sentiment, while this certainlycannot be said of the mass of the troops themselves. Again and again we hear thatwhile some of the leading militarists actively or passively favour a communist rising,in order to be able, after repressing it, to overthrow the republic, they are very anxiousthat this movement should not break out prematurely, as in that case their men wouldnot be prepared to follow them in a crusade for reaction.As to the future attitude of the troops themselves, this depends in a high degreeupon the success or failure of the republican regime, which again depends mainly uponeconomic factors. If Germany is left to collapse under the burden of her difficulties,if Western Europe and America can do nothing to stabilise the exchange and thusrender it possible for Germany to resume her commerce and her export industries atremunerative rates, things will go from bad to worse, and the military and semi-militaryorganisations may be carried away in a general movement of despair towards reaction.Question of legality of these so-called Police Forces under the Armistice and the Peace-Treaty.The prevalence of crime and the inability of the ordinary civil police to deal withthe situation are urged as an excuse for the organisation of these special police forces.But it must be borne in mind that disorders may be magnified with a view to obtainingconcessions from the Allied and Associated Powers as to the strength of the Germanarmy and auxiliary forces. Such concessions have already been granted with regardto the period within which the army must be reduced to 100,000 men.a&apos;-^ateiife^^iw-yeftrs. But the German Government,urges that &quot; the establishment ofthe new police for the whole of Germany is the more urgent as conditions of securityin Germany are bound to deteriorate when the total numbers of the Reichswehr (thenew regular army), who up to now have largely clone duty as police, are still furtherreduced in accordance with the provisions of the Peace Treaty.&quot;The German Government may be quite honest in its desire to substitute an armedpolice force under the authority of the Ministry of the Interior for the regular Army asa bulwark against disorder. But it is possible that these police forces, like the Armyitself, may come under the influence of reactionary officers.Once &quot; special forces &quot; have been set up, their disbandment proves very difficult.This has been seen in the case of some of the so-called &quot;free corps &quot; like the &quot;LiitzowCorps,&quot; the &quot;Hindenburg Corps,&quot; and some of those &quot;marine corps&quot; which still existas special formations. Hindenburg himself is reported to have interceded for themaintenance of the corps which bears his name ; and the Lutzow Corps indulged theother day in manifestations in his honour when he came to Berlin.Strictly speaking illegal, according to P.eace Treaty, but difficult to dispense with.Strictly speaking, as a Summary of Intelligence (blre) paper of 4th Novemberpoints out, all these organisations for the maintenance of order are contrary to theterms of the Peace Treaty. Yet it is difficult to see how order could be maintainedwithout them.December 2, 1919.&quot; Under the original Conditions of Peace presented to the Germans, the reductionwas to have taken place within two months; in the Treaty as finally signed the periodis prolonged and provision made for a gradual reduction. The number of effectivesmust be reduced to 200,000 within three months of the coming into force of the Treaty,and to 100,000 not later than the 31st March, 1920. Owing to the long delay iuratification, the real difference will in fact be very small.&quot;
