1I3Military Secret./jocii1197row Viceroy, Foreign Department, to Secretary of State for India,7th December 1919.(Received 8th.)480. Reports of Afghan activities on the frontier are very conflicting and it isdifficult to distinguish the truth from falsehood, but following summary is given foryour information :-Shah JDaula has remained at Wana encouraging Waziris andpromising them military assistance. There have been unconfirmed rumours ofAfghan intentions to try and extricate him. Eighty mule-loads of rations for him aresaid, on good authority, to have reached Wana about 26th November. There havebeen frequent reports of the arrival of Afghan reinforcements in Khost and of thecollection of supplies and ammunition. But some informers state ihese forces aredesigned only to bring depleted Afghan frontier garrisons up to strength. On thewhole, it seems likely that there has been some Afghan military activity on thefrontier with a view to encourage our tribes against us, without any overt action towhich we could take exception.
