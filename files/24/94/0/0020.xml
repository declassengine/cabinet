It would have been quite impossible for me to acquire a knowledge ofthe situation, or to submit the above-mentioned reports in the time which elapsedbetween my assumption of command of the Mission and the date of the last report,without the invaluable assistance of Lieut.-Colonel T. H. Keyes, C.I.E., acting forBrig.-General A. P. Blackwood, D.S.O., Brig.-General, General Staff, who was firsttouring and then placed on the sick list; of Brig.-General C. Ogston, C.M.G., D.S.O.,Deputy Adjutant and Quartermaster-General; and of Lieut.-Colonel E. D. Young,C.M.G., the Base Commandant at Novorossisk.3. It was my intention first to submit to you, with the least possible delay, theneeds of General Denikin and of the Mission, and then, immediately after doing so, tomake a tour of the front, in order to see with my own eyes the state of affairsgenerally and the manner in which the assistance furnished by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment was being applied.4.

TI. Chief Factors governing Situation tn July.5. The chief factors governing the situation in July, 1919, were : (a.) The failure of the Russian administrative services to furnish the front lineformations with British munitions (paragraphs 6-22).(b.) The unpractical nature of the Russian artillery training which was resulting ina failure to make full use of the British guns (paragraphs 32-39).(c.) The great moral effect of the tanks (paragraphs 97-100),(d.) The lack of aircraft (paragraphs 80-84).(e.) The command of the Caspian and Black Seas (paragraphs 111 and 125).(/.) The rapid expansion of the front which was rendering decentralization both ofRussian and British effort imperative (paragraphs 132-135).(g.) The improvement in morale clue to the successes in the Donetz Basin and tothe material evidence of British support (paragraphs 7, 16, 19).(h.) The attitude of the population of the re-occupied districts towards Bolshevism(paragraphs 146-149).(i) The alarming economic situation, the amelioration of which depended on thereorganization of the railways (paragraphs 150-157).(j.) The internal dissensions and jealousies of the various &quot;regions &quot;which worehampering General Denikins efforts (paragraphs 224-253).(h.) The external embarrassments which beset General   Denikin  (paragraphs253-273).(I.) German efforts to obtain influence and a commercial footing (paragraphs268-273).(to.) The morale of the Bolshevik forces which depended largely on the economiccondition of the territory occupied by them and on the evidence of foreignsupport or antagonism (paragraphs 282-289).(n.) The strength of the Bolshevik forces as governed by the situation on otherfronts (paragraphs 297-300).(o.) The policy of the Allies towards General Denikin.These fifteen factors, the changes in their incidence, and the measures taken withregard to each, wili be dealt with seriatim.III. Failure or Russian Administrative Services.6. This Mission is essentially a Mission to ensure the delivery of British warmaterial to General Denikins fighting troops. It is, therefore, the failure of theRussian administrative services which has engaged the greater part of my attention.7. The almost magical effect of the first appearance in the field of British tanksand British equipment in the advance across the Donetz Basin in May and June, 1919,was somewhat misleading. It happened that the majority of units operating along theTaganrog Kharkov railway had been completely equipped. The success wasspectacular; but, in the absence of officers for Q liaison along a front which alreadycovered 600 miles, it was impossible for the Mission to realize that our clothing andequipment were not reaching the fighting troops along other lines of communication ina similar manner.8. It was not till I visited the front and saw troops in action at Konstantinograd,Karlovka, Poltava, Berezovo and Viazovka, that I realized that, with the exception ofthose units of the Volunteer Army operating on the Taganrog-- Kharkov railway, udta single unit of any of the armies was satisfactorily equipped. Many of the men evenin the magnificent officer regiments of Kornilov, Markov and Drozdovski, which are thepride of the Volunteer Army, and the fine Guards Composite Regiment were in ragsand without boots.9. The Don Army was even worse equipped and the Caucasian Army was nobetter off than the Volunteer Army.10. Mv visits to the front and the base showed me that (a.) The stores and equipment supplied by His Majesty&apos;s Government were notreaching the fighting troops either as quickly or in the form or to theextent that they should.(6.) Clothing and equipment were not issued to complete units or as complete sets.(c.) Medical equipment was almost entirely lacking in front line units andformations.
(d.) Guns, machine guns and Lewis guns were deficient of spare parts and ofbuffer and lubricating oil. Machine and Lewis guns had not their propercomplement of belts and drums.(e.) A great quantity of the material of all kinds urgently required at the frontwas lying in storehouses at the base and at intermediate depots.11. The effect of this on front line troops was exactly what might have beenexpected, namely, disillusionment and loss of faith in our materiel and in the efficacy ofour,assistance. Enemy agents were quick to grasp the opportunity given them tospread reports that we were supplying defective and worn-out articles at exorbitantprices to pay which Russians would be bound to us as slaves for years to come.12. The fault lay partly with the Russian administrative services, winch are runboth on wrong lines and by incompetent officials, and partly with ourselves, because wehad not the staff or personnel which would have enabled us to guarantee that theRussians understood and dealt with the material supplied to them in such a way as toensure its proper issue to the troops.13. Warning against breaking up complete sets of clothing and equipment was,however, given to the Chief of Supply by the Russian Base Commandant at Novorossiskas early as the 27th March, 1919, in the following terms :- Clothing and equipment are now being received in Novorossisk off Britishtransports.They consist of most valuable articles of uniform : greatcoats, jackets, trousers,forage caps, underclothing, long and ankle boots and other articles of clothing andequipment, in tens of thousands of sets.The great value of this material imposes on us the obligation to adopt allnecessary measures to ensure that it is used to the best advantage and to avert anypossibility of its being broken up or carelessly used by troops or institutions.I am of opinion that this can only be done by issuing the British clothing andequipment to units, in complete sets, for the full number of men in the units, sothat the men may be entirely reclothed from head to foot, from greatcoat to under-clothing. Any issues to individuals, or to only a proportion of the men in units,should be strictly forbidden.Every bit of the old clothing should be taken from the men and either sent torepair shops or issued to labour units.It is only by this means that we will be able to ensure that the new clothingdoes not find its way to the bazaars, because the inspection of the uniformly clad menof a unit will be possible and easy.Equipment rolls must be kept and the old rules regarding the treatment, wearand sale of articles must be reintroduced.Such uniform good clothing will, moreover, have an immense moral anddisciplinary effect; our units will cease outwardly to resemble bands of Bolsheviks.In view of the importance of the subject, I request to be informed of thedecision of the Commander-in-Chief regarding the clothing of the Army.14. This advice, which expresses very clearly the views which are held by all thosewho understand the subject, was not; however, followed, with the result that much ofour uniform and equipment has been broken up, dispersed and dissipated.15. I decided that my duty both to His Majesty&apos;s Government and to GeneralDenikin called for plain speaking.   I, therefore, addressed to General Denikin the &apos;following letter, written after a visit to the Base : &quot;To the Commaiider-in-Chief,- Armed Forces of South Russia,Ekaterinodar,Your Excellency, 7/20th August, 1919.1. I have visited the Base at Novorossisk &quot;and inspected ordnance depots inEkaterinodar.2. The opinion of the troops at the front, namely, that things which they shouldhave are either lying in depots or being worn by men on the lines of communication,appears to be justified to a certain extent.3. In Ekaterinodar I visited an ordnance depot which had received 4,400 completesets of clothing and equipment, out of which not a single complete set, according to ourequipment tables, had been issued, with the result that on the 19th August there were
in this store varying numbers of the different items of clothing and equipment, ofwhich the, following are examples : Putties...      ......      ............ NilCaps   ...     -.................. 193Boots ..,      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...   pairs 616^Waterproof sheets   ...      ...    ....      ...      ... 157Greatcoats     ..      ...      ,.       ...      ...      ... ^36bhirts.....&quot;................ 5,2994. This means that 4,400 complete sets, which might have been used to equipcompletely 4,400 lighting men at the front, have been broken up.5. Moreover,&apos;the entrenching tool, which forms part of the equipment, is not keptwith the equipment. It is handed over to the engineer stores, but I could not find anyof these tools in the Engineer Park at Ekaterinodar. The troops need them and theyshould not be separated from the equipment,6. About 150,000 sets of clothing a&apos;nd equipment have been issued to the Army,but, as I have already informed your Excellency, I have not so far seen a single soldierin the front line equipped with a complete set of British clothing and equipment.7. I attach a minute on this subject by General Stavitski to the Chief of Supply,dated 14/27th March of this year (see paragraph 13), which coincides exactly with theopinion I have formed after a visit to the front and to the base.8. I am dharged by His Majesty&apos;s Government to render you all assistance in mypower in order to get material to the front. At present material is not reaching thefront as it should and I must again emphasize the importance of the moral factor, withwhich General Stavitski deals very clearly in his minute.9. The actual conditions at the front, as seen by me, are producing the oppositeeffect. The issue of odd bits of clothing and equipment to individuals here and therein the fighting line disillusions as to the efficacy of our help the very men upon whomdepends either victory or defeat, and furnishes a fertile field for anti-British propaganda.10. The present system of the issue to individuals of various articles of clothingand equipment makes it impossible to provide any effective check, or to calculate therequirements for replacements ; and it will be impossible to equip complete units,because the articles required to make up complete sets will have been dispersed.Moreover, it will be impossible for the sick and wounded to get a change of clothingby utilizing the change which they should carry in the pack.11. I trust, therefore, that your Excellency will find it possible to order that, infuture (a.) British uniform and equipment shall be issued in complete sets, including theentrenching tool, to whole units ;(h.) British uniform and equipment shall not be issued, in any circumstances, toindividuals, until all lighting units have been equipped.12. I also found at the base a large quantity of medical equipment for battalionsand advanced dressing stations, which had been lying there for periods varyingbetween 3 weeks and 4^- months. At the same time, I saw on the Don front battalions,advanced dressing stations, field ambulances and casualty clearing stations which weredeficient of the very first-aid, life-saving, medical stores and instruments which werelying uselessly in dep6ts at the base.13. I am afraid that my activities may be distasteful to certain individuals, but itis my duty, both to you and to His Majesty&apos;s Government, to assist you to the best ofmy ability and I can only do this by reporting to your Excellency the facts as I seethem, and by acting in the manner I conceive to be the best in your interests.14. I wish to invite your Excellency&apos;s attention to the excellent work done byColonel Tverdokhlieb at the ammunition dump in Ekaterinodar.15. I leave to-day for a visit to Tsaritsin and the Caucasian Army front.I have, &amp;c,&quot;
IV. Aide-Memoire for General Denikin.16. On my return to Taganrog on the completion of my tour, I had, on the 3rdSeptember, an interview with General Denikin, and appealed to him in the followingwords, which I requested him to treat as secret and personal: &quot; Your Excellency,I want you to believe that I am actuated solely by the desire to assist you to beatthe Bolsheviks, that I have the greatest admiration for the gallantry and patriotism ofthe armies now under your command and the warmest affection for Russians, but Ishould consider myself failing in duty did I not tell you frankly and plainly what Iconceive to be the defects which are not only delaying the completion of your greattask, but even endangering its success.It has become a generally accepted historical fact that in 1915 the Russian Army,having almost destroyed itself in the offensive into East Prussia, undertaken solely withthe purpose of relieving the pressure on Paris, was fighting almost with bare hands,while the Allies were unable to bring Russia any relief, but this is not an entirely fairpicture.In the beginning of 1915 the allowance of* shells per British battery in France wasnegligible, and our infantry, lacking machine guns, were being blown out of theirtrenches by such concentrated gunfire as had never been seen in war.When Russia asked us to relieve the pressure and open a new line of supply byforcing the Dardanelles, military opinion in England was against the venture, holdingthat the effects on other theatres of war could not be commensurate with the expendi-ture of men and material, which were so urgently needed on the Western Front.It was solely Russia&apos;s need that induced the War Cabinet to undertake this costlyoperation, which used up hundreds of ships and enormous quantities of ammunition, anddeprived the British forces in France ol several badly-needed divisions.Before our army in France possessed even a semblance of the strength necessaryfor its task, or was supplied with anything like a sufficient quantity of ammunition, wewere thus employing much-needed men, ships and ammunition to open a way to help youin the south, and in the north were employing ships to supply you with British guns,and ammunition, and were carrying and escorting for you munitions from America.This was the least we could do for you.&quot;   It would, in ordinary circumstances, beill-becoming to an Englishman to mention this fact at all, but it is a link in the chain ofevents and causes to which I must refer if I am to prove to you the necessity for theaction which is required if the success of your operations is not to be endangered byavoidable causes.The reports of all foreign officers who visited the Russian front concur in the opinionthat it was chiefly the incompetence of the Russian supply services and of the civilianorganizations behind them that caused failures. The reports of the British SupplySection in Russia are particularly clear. Batteries of British howitzers were lost: sometook over a year reaching the front from Archangel; whole trainloads of munitionswhich left Archangel and Vladivostock were never heard of again; and there was.always the same story of corruption and bribery in the supply services and on therailways, and of the pride of officers who declined to learn how to make use of ourweapons.The same defects have caused the suspension of British material aid to Admiral:Kolchak&apos;s forces.Turning to reports regarding your Excellency&apos;s theatre of operations I find that,,when General Poole came here in December, jealousies and dissensions prevented unityof command and of supply. It was his threat to General Krasnov that Great Britainwould give not one stitch of clothing or one round of ammunition unless he acknow-ledged unity of command, and his statement that all British supplies would be givendirectly to )rour Excellency that&apos;forced the Don to accept your command.The Don failed at once, and the reasons for its failure are clear. General Krasnov,.it is true, had deceived the Cossacks with promises of immediate Allied assistance,made before the Allied Missions arrived. It is unfortunately true also that the FrenchLiaison officer did promise French troops, but there were other causes.General Krasnov, in order to make the Allied Missions believe that the Don waspowerful and well organized and the centre of resistance to the Soviet power, resortedto all sorts of unworthy tricks. Allied officers were showed small units of well-clothedand well-armed men, while the troops doing the actual fighting were nearly naked andalmost unarmed,, They were shown leather factories, &amp;c, which had been kept goingby the Germans for their own purposes; ammunition factories turning out many
thousands more shell cases for 6-inch guns than could be filled or, if filled, could beus: d, considering the life of the guns he possessed; and many thousands of 3-inchshells of which 93 per cent, are now failing to explode. This was all done by a RussianGeneral deliberately to deceive and for almost personal ends.The consequence was that the Cossacks, seeing themselves again the victims ofsuch shameful exploitation, neglected and almost naked, left the front. The situationis little better to-day. *The Don Cossacks were an integral part of your front. It was their defectionwhich lost you the fruits of VrangeFs splendid succe&amp;ses in the North Caucasus, whenthe Kuban Cossacks were fighting to free their own lands.It is the slackening of the Don now, the failure to inspire your new-mobilizedtroops and the slackening off of the spirit of the Kuban which threaten to lose you thefruits of the magnificent gallantry of the Volunteer Army and jeopardize the success ofyour troops in the Ukraina.It is because I believe that you have the greatest task of any patriot in history,and that you may be so close to success that I hold it my duty to point out that youare also exposed to the danger of a failure which would cause Russia generations ofmoral and physical suffering and degradation.A fulhopportunity has been given to your Excellences administrative services toapply the British military aid placed at your disposal to the best advantage for thedefeat of the enemy.My tour to all parts of the front, which I have just completed, shows me beyondthe shadow of a doubt that they have failed, and that the defects revealed in Siberiaare occurring in a very large measure in this theatre of operations.I have reported to you after each stage of my tour the impressions produced uponme by what I saw with my own eyes in the front line, which is the only thing thatreally matters, and the condition of which is an infallibly true mirror reflecting theefficiency or otherwise of all rearward services. At a time when between 150,000 and200;000 complete sets of clothing and equipment had been issued to your supply serviceand armies, I found not a single Russian soldier with a complete set of Britishequipment; soldiers barefooted and in rags, fighting on cold nights without greatcoat,blanket, or waterproof sheet, and on hot days without a water-bottle ; sick and woundedlying on the ground in their filthy rags without the first necessities of treatment, whilea rich store of British medical equipment lay at the base for periods varying from3 weeks to 4^- months ; British guns without buffer or lubricating oil, or the necessarytools or spare parts, all of which had been delivered at the base ; 60-pr. guns, capableof sinking the Bolshevik flotilla with the greatest of ease, mounted on tractors contraryto all sense and experience, firing shells into the sea at Taganrog, while the Bolshevikflotilla is shelling Generel Vrangefs forces on the road along the Volga ; ()0-pr. gunsand&apos; 8-inch howitzers lying on the quay at Novorossisk when they might be in battlepositions at Tsaritsin, &amp;c. I do not wish to weary you with the details of all Ihave seen, but I should be guilty of the gravest dereliction of duty if I failed to stateclearly that this state of affairs, if continued, can only lead to disaster. Against all thisis the proof positive of what can be done by the proper use of the material which HisMajesty&apos;s Government is so glad to place at jour disposal.The first few sets of clothing and equipment were issued complete to troops of theVolunteer Army, notably the Iron Brigade from Odessa, and had the effect of raisingthe morale of the troops.The present system of dispersing, breaking up and squandering the clothing andequipment is having a bad effect in every way.I wrote to your Excellency from Ekaterinodar on 20th August, and requested youto issue orders as a result of my experiences.I request your Excellences sanction to the only procedure which, 1 am convinced,can give the desired results, namely, that the British Mission shall issue at the base orbases, to the representatives of armies only, until fighting units are equipped, and thatthe liaison groups with armies be used to ensure that the clothing and equipment isissued complete and understood by those to whom it is issued.17. General Denikin received my statement as only a man of his calibre would,that is to say, in a very sympathetic manner, because he understood the motives whichdictated it. . He said that the evils went deeper than I could see, and that the generaldemoralization of the people, similar, in an exaggerated degree, to the reaction whichwas being felt even in a country of strong nerves like the United Kingdom, wasresponsible for more of the trouble than was the incompetence of his supply service^
His hands were tied also by the jealousies and corruption of the local governments-which he had to humour. He promised to call a conference of the heads of his-administrative services and gave certain orders regarding the method of dealing withBritish materiel which will be referred to in the context of this report.V.-Attitude op Supply Services.18. The senior officers of the supply services did not receive my criticisms and theimplied change in system in the same broad-minded manner as the Oommander-in-Chief.General Lukomski, head of the Military Department; General Sannikov, Chief ofSupply, and General Kirei, Chief of Artillery Supply, resigned. Their resignationswere met with one of General Denikin&apos;s rare bursts of rage, and refused. Theyattended the conference, and, seeing that my proposals were designed solely in Russianinterests, and that every effort was being made to consider their amour-propre, theygave in with, good grace. Throughout, personal relations have been of the most friendlycharacter.YI. Conference of Heals of Administrative Services.19. At the conference, which was held on the 5th September, I read the foljowing : &quot; I desire, with the permission of your Excellency, to make the following perfectlyeandid statement: I was sent to Russia as a volunteer after 4^- years &quot;of service in France, to assistGeneral Denikin in his splendid struggle against the Bolsheviks, who are seen to be theenemies of all right-thinking people, no matter what their nationality may be.It is a great honour for me to be selected as chief of this Mission. It is only thedepth of my feelings and the sincerity of my intentions which compel me to place thefollowing facts before you.The principal duties entrusted to me by my Government are to communicate tothem the military needs of General Denikin, in order that his troops may be suppliedwith what they require, to enable them to defeat the Bolsheviks as quickly as possible.After assuming command of the Mission on the 13th June I first of all studied thecomposition and efficiency of the Mission itself, and found that I had not the numbersof officers and men necessary for the accomplishment of the task before me.As a result of this shortage of personnel the Mission was unable, at first, to affordyou full assistance in matters connected with&apos; the handling and adaptation of ourmaterial aid.I, therefore, addressed a report to the War Office, with a request for the personnelI required and for the war material to meet General Denikin&apos;s needs,I received a favourable reply, and I will soon have 283 officers and about 1,200other ranks, exclusive of Royal Air Force and the Tank detachment.As soon as I had despatched my report, I started, with the permission of theCommander-in-Chief, on a visit to the front, and I have now been to parts of thefighting line on the fronts of three armies.My object was to see for myself to what extent British uniform and equipmentwere reaching the fighting troops, and whether the troops knew how to use theweapons and equipment we had supplied.In the intervals between my tours to the front I visited Novorossisk and depotsthere and in Ekaterinodar.In these dep6ts I found large quantities of articles which were badly needed atthe front.The following will give you an impression of what I saw with my own eyes at thefront, which is the true reflection of the state of affairs in rear.(Here I quoted from my aide memoire to General Denikin, paragraph 16.)I do not wish to weary you with a recapitulation of all that I saw, but I shouldfail in my duty if I did not state quite clearly that such a state of affairs, if continued,may lead to failure.On the other hand, there is conclusive evidence to show what can be done by theproper utilization of the British war material which His Majesty^ Government sogladly places at your disposal. (The first few thousand sets of uniform and equipment were issued complete toVolunteer Aimy units and to the Iron Brigade from Odessa, and had a remarkableeffect in raising the morale of these units.The present system of breaking up the sets and of dissipating them by issuingcertain articles only to individuals, produces a bad impression in all respects.
I am firmly convinced, without fear of contradiction, that the men cannot continueto fight bare-footed and&apos; in rags; if they have to lie out on cold, damp nights withoutgreatcoats or waterproof sheets; or work across waterless tracts of country, on hotdays, without water-bottles. No more can they remain in action without cartridgepouches to contain the large amount of ammunition required in modern fighting.In round figures about 200.000 complete sets of clothing and equipment havealready been issued, 90,000 are ready for issue, and 200,000 more are on the way out.With these the whole of the troops on the front might be completely equipped,,but I must say that a large proportion must be regarded as dissipated.I can only undertake to supply the necessary clothing and equipment, and to makereplacements on the condition that complete units are clothed and equipped. If this isdone I can guarantee that all troops in the front line will be clothed.If this- is not done the results will be deplorable, both as regards morale and asconcerns the question of distribution.At present many of those in the fighting line think that British help is insignificant,,and that all the talk about it is nothing more than propaganda. They judge by whatthey actually see, just as I judge by what I have seen.At the same time His Majesty&apos;s Government at home are subjected to persistentattacks on account of the expenditure they are incurring, and the much-needed shipswhich they are using in order to help Prussia.You will, therefore, fully realize the necessity for using the material which is being-sent to you to the very best advantage so as to give no handle to those who are workingday and night to stop the despatch of military stores to Russia.I fully recognize the immense difficulties with which your services of supply haveto contend, and it is only with the object of co-operating and assisting, now that I shallhave at my disposal an adequate staff for the purpose, that I make the suggestionsthat : (a.) In future British uniforms and equipment shall be issued in complete sets tocomplete fighting units.(6.) Equipment rolls shall be kept by every commanding officer.(c.) Allotments to the various armies shall be made, as at present, by GeneralDenikin, and the British Mission staff shall be responsible that the armiesreceive complete sets in accordance with these allotments. The Britishliaison groups with armies shall make it their duty to show the troops howto wear, and use the equipment.If all departments will work in complete- harmony Avith the Mission, instead ofthinking that we are interfering in matters which do not concern us, we will be ableto fulfil our duty, which is to serve General Denikin and his troops.I wish to say that we have come here with the keenest desire to help, but it isnecessary to remember also that there is strong opposition in certain quarters inEngland, and I therefore request most earnestly that I may receive at the hands ofall those who earnestly desire the welfare of Russia that assistance and co-operationwhich will enable me to perform the task entrusted to me.And I also beg for recognition of the fact that we do possess both knowledge andexperience regarding the best way to make use of our own war materiel, and of thefact that our one desire is that you should derive the fullest possible advantage fromthat materiel.&quot;VII. Scheme foe the issue of British Military Material.20. After this conference, which was attended by the heads of General Denikin&apos;sadministrative services and departments and by the &quot; Chief Supply&quot; officers of armies,who accepted my proposals in principle, .1 proceeded to Novorossisk, where, at a.conference attended by the Deputy Adjutant and Quartermaster-General and the BaseCommandant, and by the Russian authorities at the base, the following proceduregoverning the issue of British material was drawn up. This has since been approvedby General Denikin and issued as an order :-21. &quot; Orders for issue of British military material by British Military-Mission.(1.) In future issues at the bases will be made by British Base Headquarters toarmy representatives, except when the Commander-in-Chief approves of special issuesto the Intendance, for issue to institutions and units, a list of which will be furnishedto Munitions Headquarters by the Intendance after issue.
(2.) The issues to armies will be conveyed to armies by train or by ship. The tramsor ships will be loaded at the bases under existing arrangements, and will be safe-guarded, escorted and conveyed under army arrangements to first destination.(3.) Each train or ship containing British material for one army only will beconducted, if possible, by a British officer or other rank provided by Munitions Head-quarters. If such cannot be provided, the army concerned will find a Russianconducting officer, as well as the officer or officers for escorting, &amp;c.(4.) The train or shiploads will consist of ordnance, medical, veterinary, signal andengineer stores, and, when required, artillery stores.(5.) In order that &quot;the requirements of any particular army may be despatched inone train or ship, it is imperative that allotments shall be made to include stores of theservices mentioned in paragraph 4.(6.) The army receiving a train or shipload of material at the destination to whichthe train or ship is consigned, will be responsible for the personnel required (a.) To take over from the conducting officer and sign for the material.(b.) To unload the material.(c.) To safeguard, escort and convoy the material to the final destination.(7.) Munitions Headquarters will notify the British Base Commandants of theallotments referred to in paragraph 5 and of the order of priority of issue to armies.(8.) On receipt of the above the British Base Commandants, in consultation withthe local Russian authorities, will be responsible for the composition of the trains orships. They will keep Munitions Headquarters informed of the progress of each trainand ship despatched and about to be despatched from the Bases, by a weekly report orwhen required. The Russian authorities are responsible for the provision of trainsand ships.(9.) In future the exact numbers of each article which make up the complete sets ofequipment and clothing will be issued by the British bases unless orders to the contraryare received.(10.) All British material now in possession of the Russian depots at the bases willl)e placed at the disposal of the British depots for re-issue as complete sets. Britishmaterial which arrives at the bases will be dealt with as follows : -(a.) Aeroplanes and Royal Air Force material will be received by the StoresOfficer, Royal Air Force, and despatched to Headquarters, Royal Air Force,Taganrog, for issue.(b.) Artillery and artillery material will be handed over to the British ArtilleryEquipping Station at Novorossisk.(c.) Ammunition will be handed over to Russian authorities ex ship.(cl.) All Machine guns and machine gun stores will be received by the ArtilleryEquipping Station, Novorossisk, and despatched to the British MachineGun Equipping School at Rostov for issue.(e.) All rifles will be handed over direct to the Russian Director of ArtillerySupplies at the base for issue as required.(f.) Tanks and Tank stores received at Novorossisk by the Stores Officer of theTank Corps will be despatched to the British Tank Detachment at Taganrogfor issue. ,   .(g.) All Mechanical Transport material will be handed over to the Russian Auto-Committee, ex ship.(h.) All Ordnance (other than above), signal, veterinary and medical stores willbe handed over at the bases to the British dep6ts concerned,(i.) All Naval stores (other than guns) will be received by a British NavalEquipping Station, under a British Naval officer,(j.) All Naval guns will be received by the Artillery Equipping Station, whencethey will be issued to:Russian Army or Navy representatives as orderedby General Denikin.22. A further inspection of the Russian base dep6ts fully bore out all the criticismsof their administrative services which I had been compelled to make. For example, Ifound 100,000 entrenching tools in the Engineer stores. These had been retainedinstead of being issued with the equipment. In the Artillery Park there were essentialstores and spare parts for machine and Lewis guns, for want of which a large proportionof the guns were out of action at the front.
VIII. Working of New System.23. The system in paragraph 21 cannot be worked in its entirety until the Qnaison officers and ordnance personnel provided for in the establishments have arrived.A start has, however, been made by employing railway officers and others.24. The Russian administrative services and departments have been to blame formuch of the failure to deal properly with our stores and equipment, but they have beenhandicapped by the shortage of British ordnance personnel, which has made it impos-sible for the Mission to give them that assistance in the explanation, tabulation,handling and sorting of stores strange to them which would have saved many seriouserrors. I have been obliged to assist the Ordnance Services by detailing officersintended for other purposes, and this has entailed disorganization of the whole of theMission.25. In spite of repeated requests, I have now only 9 officers and 25 other ranksof the Royal Ordnance Corps to deal with the great quantities of stores which arearriving, and, in spite of ail efforts to assist them by other officers and men, who are, ofcourse, lacking in the necessary knowledge and experience, there is congestion anddelay at the base.26. It is only fair to the overworked ordnance personnel at the base, who havedone wonders in the circumstances, and to those officers and men who have assistedthem, that these facts should be put on record.IX.-Good Relations with Russian Staffs.27. A great deal of good has been done by the institution of a weekly conferenceat Rostov. This is attended by the Chief of Supply and by the heads of GeneralDenikins administrative services and departments, by myself and the heads of branchesof the Staff and administrative services and departments of the Mission.- 28. It has brought together Russian officers who have hitherto not been in thehabit of either working with or meeting each other, and I am sure that it will be themeans of getting them on to sounder lines of co-operation and usefulness. It hasproduced a distinct tone of camaraderie among all of us. I must pay a tribute to theway in which General Sannikov, Chief of Supply, and the other Russian General officersconcerned and their subordinates have received the proposals and measures suggestedby me for our mutual benefit. It was only necessary for them to realize the motive forthem to act as they have done.29. I must also pay a tribute to Brigadier-General Keyes, Brigadier-General,General Staff, and Colonel Young, Acting Deputy Adjutant and Quartermaster-General,and to the other officers of the Mission, who, by their personality and tact, have tidedover what threatened to be a critical situation. Drastic action was necessary, both toopen General Denikius eyes to what was happening, and to avert the serious danger ofa set back which threatened to result from a failure to supply the fighting troops withtheir essential needs. That this situation developed as it has developed, instead ofproducing a split, is due chiefly to General Denikin, but the subsequent work is a veryfine testimony to their tact and to the position which they had established with theirRussian opposite numbers. A tribute must also be paid to those highly placed Russianofficers who put duty before pride.X. Issues of British War Material.30.. The following are the issues actually made by the British.

Prospects op Improvement in Prussian Supply Services.31. I hope that the new system which has been introduced will result in a speedierdelivery to the troops of all that is available to meet their needs. Much depends uponthe arrival of the British officers I have asked for to complete the liaison groups withthe various armies. I am now about to start on a further tour along the front andwill then be able to judge whether results are commensurate with the efforts made tosecure better administration,XII. Faults of Russian Artillery Training.32. The necessity for better liaison between the&quot; artillery schools and the batteriesat the front, which was brought forward in my letters of 8th and 21st July, has sincebeen still more clearly shown. During my visits to the front in July and August, onwhich I was accompanied by the senior artillery liaison officer, Lieut.-Colonel Ling, itbecame clear that our guns were not being used up to more than 25 per cent, of theirreal value. The instruction given at the schools was too theoretical, and batteries weresent to the front ill-equipped and with little knowledge of their guns. Consequently,,our guns, especially the 18-pr., were mis-used ; and, when put out of action by minordefects, the batteries were unable to repair them, because the necessary spare parts andtools were in dep6ts instead of with the guns.33. The result of this was that the- Russian artillery were inclined to loseconfidence in our guns and. to believe that we were sending them inferior and worn-out.weapons.XIII. System adopted for Artillery Instruction, Liaison and Equipment.34. The needs of the artillery at the front were so serious and immediate that itwas inadvisable to await the conference of all supply services which was being assembled(paragraph 19). I, accordingly, obtained permission from General Denikin for Lieut. -Colonel Ling, who had noted the needs of the batteries of the Volunteer Army, to drawfrom the artillery park .at Novorossisk ail that was required in the way of tools,instruments, spare parts, replacements, buffer and lubricating oils, &amp;cv and to take,them to the batteries-in the field by special train, together with a mobile workshop.
35. Within a fortnight 36 batteries of the Volunteer Army, which were practicallyout of action owing to the lack of parts and easily remediable defects, were sufficientlyequipped to give them a fair start, and the Corps Parks were filled up with necessaryspare parts, &amp;c. These batteries were spread over a front of 200 miles with no lateralcommunications, the furthest being over 60 hours by rail from the base at Novorossisk.The lack of system at the Artillery Park at Novorossisk also entailed much labour inobtaining the necessary stores.36. This energetic performance was much appreciated by the Artillery of theVolunteer Army, but reflected so little credit on the Armed Forces&apos; &quot; Artillery Supply &quot;that it was naturally at first resented by the latter. It speaks volumes for the goodrelations that exist between this Mission and the Russian staffs that this resentmentspeedily evaporated and that the Artillery Supply accepted a system, submitted to andapproved by General Denikin, under which an Artillery Equipping Section has beenformed at Novorossisk under British Artillery officers, aided by Russian personnel.37. The Senior Artillery Liaison officer superintends the equipment by this sectionof all new batteries that are formed. A reception party is sent to Novorossisk byeach new battery under an officer of the battery, who signs a receipt for all equipmenttaken over. The Senior Artillery Liaison officer also completes the equipment of allbatteries already armed with British guns by sending to them, in charge of Britishofficers, all equipment that is necessary to complete them.38, The necessary Artillery Liaison officers, began to arrive in September and 20are now, or will shortly be, with batteries at the front,,XIV. Increase in Artillery Liaison and Instruction Officers.39. In my supplementary report No. II. 3/703 of 2&quot;1st July, Section L, I explainedthe necessity for an increase in Artillery Liaison officers. Six officers surplus to thenumber asked for have already left the United Kingdom, and all but two of these havearrived in South Russia, but unfortunately no fitters accompanied them. Since thedate of that report the front has expanded with great rapidity; two new ArmyDistricts have been formed, and it has become necessary to send an Artillery officerwith the batteries which have been sent to the Ural Cossacks. Experience has alsoshown that the dangers of faulty and incomplete instruction are greater than was atfirst realized. I consider, after very thorough examination of the question, both in thefield and with the Chief of Artillery Supply, that, in order to get anything like thefull value of our guns, which are playing a very important part in the campaign,it is necessary to increase our effort in this direction. The Russian Artillery suffersmost of all from lack of fitters, and from the results of their old idea that it wasundignified for an officer to use his hands. This idea, is being dispelled and youngRussian officers are eager and proud to learn. The mastery which our Artillery officersshow of the technical side of their profession is an excellent example, and has gonefar towards producing those good relations which should bear fruit in the future,,40. I have, accordingly revised my War Establishments and now ask for 2 Majorsand 4 Captains in addition to those already despatched. This increases the WarEstablishments enclosed in my No. H. 3/703 of 21st July by 12 officers (including the-surplus officers already despatched, see paragraph 39), 2 warrant officers, 2 Royal ArmyOrdnance Corps staff Serjeants, 6 Royal Field Artillery and 3 Royal Garrison Artilleryfitters, 2 serjeant clerks and 5 clerks other ranks. I have requested the provision ofthese by telegram No. A. 753 of 11th October, giving the names of the officers I shouldlike to get.The amended draft War Establishments will be found in Appendix A of this,report.XV. Artillery Equipping Section.41. Most of the defects in the supply of British Artillery can be attributed to thefact that no personnel was sent out to form an equipping section. An entirelyinadequate section has been formed by officers and Serjeants withdrawn from Artilleryliaison assisted by casual Russian labour.42. I now find, from further experience, that the establishment asked for in myNo. II. 2/703 of 8th July is inadequate, and accordingly am substituting a WarEstablishment (vide Appendix A), in which I ask for the following additions andalterations One Major in command and 1 Captain, instead of 2 Captains. Both theseofficers have been detailed from the 6 surplus officers sent out, and are quite satisfactory.Two Serjeants instead of 2 warrant officers; 1 battery serjeant-major and 1 battery
quartermaster-serjeant, instead of 2 battery serjeants-major ; 1 Royal Army OrdnanceCorps artificer, additional; 2 fitters, additional; 1 clerk, additional.43. The 28 limber gunners asked for in my No. IT. 2/703 are most urgentlyrequired. They should include 2 bombardiers and 2 lance-bombardiers. For 10 18-pr. limber gunners read 12, and delete 2 anti-aircraft.XVI.-Guns.44, In my No. H. 3/703 of 21st July I stated that in my opinion the ArmedForces could not usefully absorb any more guns for regular batteries than thosepromised.The rapid expansion of the forces has led to an alteration in their system ofartillery training. Their brigades (8 batteries) are now being expanded into twobrigades of 16 batteries, and the additional personnel are trained on the spot. Theincrease in our Artillery Liaison officers renders such training possible. Consequently,more guns are being absorbed and at a more rapid rate than I thought probable.Further, the short life of the guns sent and the inexperience of the personnel has led toa much larger wastage than was anticipated.45. The following shows guns promised and actually received  &apos;	Guns promised.	Guns received.	Deficient.18-pr.        ..      ......	450	331	1194&apos;5-inch howitzers......	120	98	2260-pr...      ..      .....	60	60	6-inch howitzers......	60	61	* *8-inch howitzers	8	8	t *46. At the moment, 31 18-pr. batteries and 27 4,5-inch batteries are waitingguns, and will more than absorb the balance of those promised.47. I consider that, in addition to these, the following should be sent to armadditional batteries which the Russians are now capable of forming, and to allow forwastage : 18-pr. ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...     1504*5-inch howitzer     ...      ...      ...      ...      ...     12048. The higher proportion of 4&apos;5-inch howitzers asked for is due to the fact thatRussian horse artillery brigades are in many cases armed with these guns.49. These additional guns, if sanctioned, will entail the provision of (a.) Guns, carriages and limbers.18-prs. (i.) 120 guns, carriages and limbers complete,(ii.) 20 guns and carriages complete,(hi.) 10 pieces.(iv.) 120 wagons and limbers complete.4&quot;5-inch howitzers (v.) 100 guns, carriages and limbers complete,(vi.)

The Russians are now issuing ll- wagons per gun and not 2 per gun, and thebalance can be made up from stock in hand.Ammunition carriers, camouflage nets, spare spokes and felloes are not required.51. The local G. 1098 for 18-pr. and 4&apos;5-ineh howitzer are attached as Appendix C.They are being translated into Russian and circulated.XVII. Ammunition.52. The method of computing ammunition requirements and its storage and supplyleave much to be desired.53. There is no liaison between the Armed Forces Operations Section and ArtillerySupply, and no liaison between Artillery Supply and the Inspector-General of Artillery.Consequently the requirements of the Artillery Supply are not based on the actual stateof the artillery or the probable course of operations, the situations of the Armed Forcesdumps are not selected in accordance with the real needs of the armies, and the Inspector-General of Artillery is not kept informed of the state of the Armed Forces dumps, noris the Chief of Artillery Supply kept informed of the state of the Army dumps. Theactual management of the dumps is also unsatisfactory. Cover is seldom furnished andreturns are inaccurate. Much assistance has been rendered to the Armed Forces in thismatter by Captain Donovan, Deputy-Assistant Director of Ordnance Services,Ammunition, who has thoroughly gained the confidence of both the Artillery Supplyofficers and the Army Artillery staffs. In fact, the Ordnance Section of the BritishMilitary Mission is the chief and most accurate source of information of the armies inthe matter of ammunition.54. The following artillery ammunition has been issued to the Russians : 18-pr.4&apos;5-inch howitzer60-pr.6-inch howitzer8-inch howitzer1,338,540203,78291,27734,5408,41255. The Chief of Artillery Supply has asked for large quantities of ammunition ofall natures, but, after very careful examination of all factors, I have come to theconclusion that the only class of ammunition which requires replenishment now is thatfor our 4&apos;5-inch howitzers, which are proving of the greatest value to the Russians onaccount of the simplicity of their mechanism and the effect of the projectile.56. I have, therefore, in my telegram, No. Q. 710, of 7th October, asked for100,000 rounds of 4&apos;5-inch ammunition which should.meet the requirements of a wintercampaign.   These shells should all be H.E. ; no gas shells are required.57. If the extra guns asked for in paragraph 47 are approved, it may be necessaryto supply more ammunition, but this necessity is not likely to arise for at least threemonths.58. I have also increased my original request for 40,000 primers (primer, percussioncartridge, No. l) to 80,000, and request that all future consignment should include20 per cent, extra primers. These large increases over the normal have been foundnecessary owing to the very high percentage of missfires. A proportion of the missfiresmay be due to worn firing pins, which should be corrected when we have sufficient -fitters with batteries to thoroughly overhaul the equipment, but the greater number aredue to faulty primers.XVIII. Equipment of and Training in Machine Guns.59. This has from the beginning been one of the most satisfactory features of ourconnection with the Armed Forces in South Russia, probably because training in&apos;theRussian Army was carried out in the corps, and they had no army schools. Therewas, therefore, no systematized method of training and we started with a clean slate.Great credit is due to the small British instructional staff and to the Russian trainingstaff which so readily made use of our instructors.60. As British Vickers and Lewis guns began to -arrive, classes of instruction inthese weapons were added to the existing schools.   At these classes the training ofinstructors went on side by side with the training of personnel for manning the guns.These latter were dispersed to their units in twos and threes, and the benefit of theinstruction was soon lost.61. Meanwhile the Russian Artillery Supply was issuing Vickers and Lewis gunsdirect to units irrespective of whether the unit had anyone trained in the use of these
weapons. In one case, a Terek Cossack mounted division received, when actually inaction, 36 Lewis guns, though they had not a single officer or man who had ever seena Lewis earn before, the reason being&apos; that the Ataman of the Terek Cossacks hadcomplained that the Terek Cossacks were being neglected.62. Besides being issued in this haphazard manner, all weapons were issuedincomplete in themselves and without a, proper complement of spare parts.63. As a result of the conference mentioned in paragraph 19, the following systemhas been adopted : A British machine-gun equipping station has been started at Rostov.Our machine guns and equipment are taken up by British officers fromNovorossisk to Rostov, and there issued personally by British officers torepresentatives of units.The efficiency of this equipping station and the rapidity with which issues aremade surprises Russian officers, who are accustomed to the dilatory and inaccuratemethods of their own artillery supply.64. There is also a Central Training School at Rostov, where the whole personnelof a machine-gun unit can be equipped and trained with the weapons they will use.65. The former Russian schools are now changed to machine-gun reserve battalions,the effect of which is to provide an elastic system which can take in the whole personnelof a machine-gun company and turn it out fully equipped and trained.i&apos;)6. &apos;J he total numbers trained in Vickers and Lewis guns in classes by Britishofficers and non-commissioned officers up to 31st August were : Instructors   ...      ...      ...      ...      ,..      ...      595Fighting personnel ...      ...      ...      ...      ...    5,225Total      ...      ......     *......    5,820To judge the full effect of British instruction, to these figures must be added theunknown numbers, amounting to some thousands, trained by the instructors trainedby us.67. The following numbers of Vickers and Lewis guns have been issued up todate: Vickers guns...      ......    - ...      ...      ...    1270- Lewis guns ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...    2,74368. Every opportunity has been taken of sending British officers to front formationsto watch the work of the instructors trained by us, correct faults that have crept insince instructors and personnel have left the schools, instruct in maintenance in thefield and report the requirements of machine-gun units.69, In carrying out these important duties British instructors have shown greateagerness in getting into action. Their presence has been much appreciated by Russianofficers and men and five have already been mentioned for gallantry.70. The reports they have submitted have been of great value, giving an insightinto both the working of the administrative services and the morale of the troops.The experience gained is also invaluable from the training point of view.71. The expansion of front and of the numbers of the Armed Forces has renderednecessary the opening of schools at Tzaritzin and Kiev, in addition to the existing armyschools at Novocherkask, Rostov and Kharkov, and the &quot; regional &quot; schools at Anapa andPiatigorsk. Steps are being taken to open a school in the Southern Ukraina, probablyat Odessa.XIX. Rifles and Small-Arm Ammunition.72. There is much difficulty in getting the true situation regarding rifles andsmall-arm ammunition.73. Machine guns, rifles and ammunition are often captured in large quantities.The local commanders who make the captures form new units which they arm andsupply with ammunition. They also re-arm old units and distribute ammunitionamong them. They seldom report what they have done and, even when they do, theirreports take a very long time to reach headquarters.74. There is, in short, no system of returns on which to base an accurateappreciation of the situation.
75. Recently captured Bolshevik prisoners have, however, had so little ammunitionthat the Russian staff are afraid that they may not be able to rely in future upon thissource of supply and they are, therefore, faced with these alternatives : (a.) To apply for more ammunition for Russian rifles;(6.) To apply for more British &apos;303 rifles and more British small-arm ammunition ;(c.) To adapt British srnallrarm ammunition for use in Russian rifles, and demandmore British small-arm ammunition for this purpose;(d.) To apply for sheet brass, caps, propellant, lead and nickel, to enable them tomanufacture their own small-arm ammunition.   The machinery exists.In anticipation of a campaign lasting beyond this winter the question must befaced.76. They have actually carried out experiments with our small-arm ammunitionand state that, by pinching the shoulder of the cartridge case, it is possible to use our303 ammunition in their &quot;300 rifles and machine guns.They state that the chambering in the Russian weapon is slightly greater indiameter than the chambering in our &quot;303 weapons. This must lead to split cartridgecases,.interfere with &quot;extraction, and to erosion of the rifle. The proposition does not,therefore, appear to be a sound one. My Deputy-Assistant Director of OrdnanceServices for Ammunition is, however, asked by the Russian authorities concerned towitness more extended trials than the very limited ones carried out hitherto, and itwill shortly be possible to form a definite opinion on the subject.77. The large increase in the numbers of troops under General Denikin&apos;s command,numbers which are growing and will continue to grow, the open nature of the righting,and the increasing number of machine guns and Lewis guns employed, are undoubtedlyentailing a very great expenditure of ammunition. The Russians have now asked meto supply them with 200,000 British rifles and 1,000,000,000 rounds of &quot;303 ammunition.The latter figure is based on the assumption that they will convert most of the small- .arm ammunition to fit their own rifles.78. 1 do not think this is either sound or practical, no matter what the results ofthe experiments may be, and request, therefore, that (a.) 200,000 British &apos;303 rifles may be supplied (already asked for in my No.Q. 710 of 7th October).(b.) 200,000,000 rounds of &apos;303 small-arm ammunition may be supplied if (a) isapproved.(c.) 300,000,000 rounds of ammunition for Russian rifles may be supplied, if possible,in addition to (a) and &quot;(6).(d.) If it is impossible to supply (a), (b) and (c), sufficient sheet brass, nickel leadcaps and propellant be sent here for the manufacture of 500,000,000 roundsof Russian &quot;300 ammunition.79.

XX. Aviation.80. Lieut.-Colonel Maund, D.S.O., arrived at Ekaterinodar on 20th March, 1919,having prepared for the Air Ministry a list of equipment for 100 RE. 8&apos;s, based onexperience gained at Archangel and on the Galician front. He was to be followed byan instructional mission of 12 officers and 70 men. *81. This personnel and material only began to arrive in May, and was onlysufficiently complete to start the projected programme in June,82. However, 6 D.H. 9&apos;s. and 15 Camels, all old machines, were obtained fromMudros and Malta, with very incomplete -equipment, and arrived in April. TheAviation Mission commenced by instructing the Russians in erecting and flying thesemachines, which were further supplemented by second-hand machines from the 62ndWing at Petrovsk. Three (four-aeroplane) units, with these machines, were got to thefront early in June. A fourth unit was equipped by the 62nd Wing, and also went tothe front a little later.83. Much difficulty was experienced in equipping and training these units. Thedifficulties were due to the faulty original instruction of Russian pilots, to their over-confidence and casual character, and to the attitude of the Inspector-General of theRussian Air Force, who had been adversely reported on by General Poole. This officer,who is of an extremely jealous nature, has placed many obstacles in the way of ourinstructors and encouraged his own officers to ignore their advice.84. The projected programme was started after the despatch of the units in themiddle of June, and one &quot;aerial division&quot; of 33 machines left for the front early inAugust. The same difficulties were experienced in training this division. Just priorto leaving, and on the way to the front, four machines crashed and four pilots and fourobservers were burnt to death. All these accidents were due to the neglect of ourinstruction; but they resulted in so serious a loss of confidence in R.E. 8&apos;s that twoout of the three squadrons of the division requested to be relieved of their machines.This brought the matter to a head and. after long negotiations, the following instruc-tions were drawn up : 85. Relations between Russian and British Aviation Services : (1.) The British Aviation Mission assists Armed Forces, South Russia, in thefollowing ways : (a.) By supplying aeroplanes.(b.) By instructing pilots in a training aerodrome.(c.) By a British aviation squadron working on the front.(d.) By periodical visits of technical liaison officers.(2.) British supplies for Russian aviation, upon their arrival, are stored in Britishsheds, which are under the orders of the British Aviation Mission.(3.) When the equipment of a whole division arrives, the Chief of the BritishAviation Mission informs the Inspector of Russian Aviation, who summonsthe division next in turn from the front.(4.) The time of commencement of equipping is fixed by the Inspector of RussianAviation. From that moment the division will be under the orders of theBritish Aviation Mission in matters of equipment and training.&apos;(5.) A training aerodrome will be established for instruction in the parts of Britishaeroplanes and for practice flying.(6.) The Chief of British Aviation will appoint an officer commanding aerodromewho will superintend the training and equipping of Russian divisions. Theofficer commanding aerodrome is under the orders of the Officer CommandingBritish Aviation Mission.(7.) A Russian division in training is under the orders of the Officer CommandingBritish Aviation Mission in matters of practical or theoretical training andequipment. In matters of discipline the division is under the orders of theRussian Disciplinary Officer, Practice Aerodrome. In interior economymatters the division remains under the Russian authorities.(8.) The Disciplinary Officer, Practice Aerodrome, is appointed by the Chief ofStaff, Armed Forces, South Russia, and is under the orders of the ChiefInspector of the Russian Division. All instructions in matters of trainingand equipping are given by the Chief of the British Aviation Missionthrough the Disciplinary Officer, and the latter passes them out. TheChief of the British Aviation Mission reports direct to the Chief of Staff,.Armed Forces, South Russia, on matters of training.
(9.) Certificates of successful training are issued to the Russian pilots after thetraining is over.(10.) When the Chief of the British Aviation Mission reports training and equip-ment complete, the Russian aviation detachments are returned to theRussian aviation authorities.(11.) Each Russian aviation division trained and equipped on the training aerodromeis supplied with-8 mounted aeroplanes ...   &apos;   ...      ...      ... 1 ,   1 n10 motors I squadron.8 mounted aeroplanes ...      ...      ...      ,.,1,      ,10 motors I squodron.8 mounted aeroplanes ...      ...      .......1 ,   0 n 0     i1A     , r yto 3rd bquadron.10 motors        ...      ...      ...      ...      ... j n3 mounted aeroplanes ...      ...      ...      ...] ,  -n- - -   -n,, 1 Ho Division Base.11 motors        ...      ...      ...      ...      ... j6 aeroplanes, unmounted (in cases)   ... ...   to Division Base.Total : 33 aeroplanes, 41 motors.Spare parts for 3 months       ...      ... ...   to the Division.Lubricants for 3 months        ...      ...      ...   to the Division.The residue for the whole group       ... to Russian General Depot.Motor cars Light Fords...      ... ... ... ... ... 1Lorries, Fords       ... ... ... ... ... 3Workshops ...      ... ... ... ... ... 1Heavy lorry with trolley ... ... ... ... 1(12.) Officers commanding squadrons receiving British equipment issue vouchersfor same, and are responsible for sending copies of them to the Inspector of RussianAviation.(13.) If necessity arises British Liaison officers will be detached to the offices ofthe Quartermaster-General, Headquarters, Armed Forces, South Russia,and to the Quartermaster-General offices of all Armies.(14.) British Technical Liaison officers can be detached to Russian Aviationsquadrons fully or partly equipped by British Aviation Mission to makesure that the equipment is properly used. These officers report to theChief of the British Aviation Mission as to the proper or improper use of-the above equipment, and they are entitled to ask for &quot;technical informationfrom the Officer Commanding Russian Awiation Squadrons.British Technical Liaison officers have no right to interfere with theRussian authorities, but they must give their advices when asked for.(15.) The 47th British Aviation Squadron will be under the direct orders ofCommander-m-Chief,&quot; Armed Forces, South Russia, or will be detached toone of the armies.86. In the middle of August the British Aviation School moved from Ekaterinodarto Taganrog, and commenced wcrk on the new lines and under more favourableconditions as tu location, having taken over the Lebedev aeroplane factories,87. Several British officers, notably Lieutenant Head, who, before the move toTaganrog, had done much to remove the bad opinion the Russian pilots held of theR.E. 8&apos;s, have since done excellent work with the 1st Division which had already beenequipped, and with the division now under construction. Whenever Russian officersconsidered any manoeuvre or habit of the machine dangerous, such as spinning, &amp;c,they promptly took up their pupils, showed that these manoeuvres were not&quot; onlypossible, but not dangerous, and taught them to get out of them. Although some ofthese manoeuvres are forbidden on R.E. 8&apos;s, they were absolutely necessary to establishRussian confidence.88. The 2nd Division is now nearly completed, and the instruction has been farmore successful and rapid under the n*w system.89. The whole blame of the misunderstandings that at first arose cannot be putdown to the Russians. Echoes of the difficulties experienced in England and Francewhen R.E. 8&apos;s were first introduced reached the Russians from various sources and were,of course, exaggerated. This machine is not wholly suitable for pilots who, howe\erbrave, were originally taught to fly on a faulty system.
90. Moreover, four out of five of the instructors originally sent out were notsuitable, being prisoners of war who had not flown for some time, none of them hadflown on RE. 8 s and two were seaplane pilots. The fifth had a small experience ofR.E. 8&apos;s but was not anxious to fly them. None of the five were qualified instructors.Since the chief instructor has been replaced by Major Archer, who has been in charge of&quot;a training school, and pilots experienced in R.E. 8&apos;s have arrived, great progress hasbeen made.91. The 1st Division of RE. 8&apos;s is now at the front.92. The first four units equipped with second-hand machines had much difficult)&apos;&apos; atfirst, but are now doing well, especially No. 1 Squadron at Ekaterinoslav and Kiev.XXL-47th Squadron, R.A.F.93. Owing to the inevitable delay in despatching, setting up and instructingRussian pilots in our machines, General Denikin asked for the services of a completeBritish unit.94. The first flight of the 47th Squadron arrived, in April and started to erect itsmachines at once. It was some 2 months before the complete equipment of thesquadron arrived. The first machines, though new, arrived without minor parts orwith parts unfinished. This, coupled with the late arrival of spares, delayed thecompletion of the first flight for 6 weeks. However, from the moment it reached thefront, the 47th Squadron has done yeoman service and has astonished the Russians bythe manner in which it has taken part in the ground warfare. Cavalry divisions andtransport are constantly being scattered and it is known that much material damageand heavy casualties have been caused. Five enemy machines and three balloons havebeen accounted for. Fallen pilots have been recovered from behind the enemy linesand very valuable information has been brought in. There is no doubt that this smallBritish unit has thoroughly justified itself, and has contributed in no small measure tothe success of the Caucasian Army in countering the formidable Bolshevik thrust downthe Volga. The deeds of one British pilot especially, Captain Anderson, will form atradition with the Russian Air Service.The total numbers of machines received and issued up to 30th September, 1919,are shown in the attached table : Numbers of Machines handled by Royal Air Force Mission, South Russia.Aeroplanes received and issued to Russians.Nature of machine.

The first consignment of 12 tanks, with 11 officers and 44 other ranks, arrivedat Novorossisk on 13th April, 1919, and training commenced in Ekaterinodar on 22nd.96. The first division of about 100 Russian officers were only partly trained when,on 14th May, owing to the urgency of the military situation, the tanks were sent tothe Donetz front.
97. The tanks took part in several engagements in May and June and contributedvery largely to the success of the operations, but the reports of the British officers whowere attached to them for observation showed that the tank commanders did not usetheir tanks to the best advantage.98. Major Bruce, D.S.O., M.C., who had assumed command on 22nd May,accordingly withdrew the tanks for further instruction to Taganrog, where a tankadromewas being arranged. However, the strength of the works round Tzaritzin was causingmuch anxiety, and General Denikin decided again to put the tanks into action beforethe Russian personnel was satisfactorily trained.The tanks again distinguished themselves at the capture of Tzaritzin, especiallyone manned by a crew of British volunteers, the commander of which, Captain Walsh,was wounded.99. The tanks were again concentrated at Taganrog for further instruction on28th July.100. Since then, one section of heavies and one of whippets have been in action atPoltava, and, being well backed by Kuban Cossacks, carried out a very successfuloperation. Similar success was not met with by a detachment on the Don front. TheDon Cossacks, failing to support at a critical moment, the tanks were with difficultyextricated.101. These operations only left one tank for instructional purposes, but 16Mark V.&apos;s arrived at Taganrog in the middle of August, and intensive training wasstarted.102. In the middle of August, 1919, Major Sayer, Tank Corps, arrived at MissionHeadquarters.He was sent from the War Office to study the situation on the spot, both asregards working in the field and instruction at the school. He paid visits to the front,went into the whole question thoroughly, and finally took home with him, at the endof September, full operation reports and lists of the stores and materials required tocomplete the Russian technical tank establishment.103. By his tact and close attention to the important work in hand, he gainedboth the respect and the confidence of the Russian Staff and other officers concerned,and I trust that the; recommendations he has taken back with him will meet withsupport and approval.104. As a result of a discussion with him on the matters requiring immediateattention, I telegraphed (my No. IF. 1981, dated 25th September) the followingrecommendations: (a.) The immediate despatch of a capable senior officer to command the BritishTank Detachment in South Russia.(b.) The despatch to General Denikin of as many Mark V., or even Mark V.*,Tanks as can be made available.105. The Russians are endeavouring to manufacture spare parts and, even if theydo not succeed in doing so, they can use tanks to secure decisive results before they areout of action for lack of spares.   Cannibalizing is also open to them in case of need.Mark V.* Tanks, though slow, would be most useful for moral effect, especially inkey localities like Grozni, where their presence would have a most salutary effect uponthe tribesmen and Bolsheviks who are now threatening to attack this place which is ofvital importance to Denikin as the source from which he draws the bulk of his oil-fuel.106. The present is probably a crucial period of the campaign, and all weaponscapable of producing immediate and decisive effect are of supreme value. Tanksinvariably produce success when properly used against the Bolsheviks. A RussianColonel of the Russian General Staff, who was forced to act as Chief of the8th Bolshevik Army and released by General Mamontov during his recent raid, reportsthat Bolshevik troops are completely&quot; demoralized by the appearance of our tanks whichthey will not face.107. The first impression, produced by reports which were too hasty, was that theRussians misused the tanks, and that they would very soon have them all out of action.Subsequently, it was feared that they intended to divide responsibility by putting theguns in charge of one officer, the tanks themselves under the Mechanical TransportDepartment, and maintenance under a third authority. Luckily these fears haveproved to be unfounded. The Russians have placed their Tank Corps under one capablehead, who is responsible for everything connected with the tanks. They are training onwell, and are improving in knowledge of maintenance, which is proved by the fact thatthe original 12 tanks issued to them are in proper order and still fighting fit.
108. Russian engineers have proved their capacity under British supervision andhave successfully repaired a Mark V. machine, which had received five direct hits fromthe guns of an armoured train.109. The number of tanks which have been issued to the Russians up to date is asfollows: 5 Mark V., 19/V./19.5 Medium A., 19/V./19.6 Mark V, 12/VIII./19.4 Mark V., 7/X./19.Forty-four tanks (13 Medium A. and 31 Mark V.) remain on charge of BritishTank CorjDS. Ten are being used in the school and eight are in workshops. They willbe issued to the Russians as soon as they have crews ready.110. The system of training and of the issue of tanks and tank stores is as follows : All pupils after entering the school have to pass through the followingclasses (i.) Tank (Mark V.), maintenance,(ii.) Tank (Mark V.), driving.(iii.) Tank (Medium Mark A.), maintenance and driving,(iv.) Hotchkiss machine gun, &quot;308-inch,(v.) Hotchkiss 6-pr. gun.(vi.) Courses on motor-car management and signalling.Lectures are also delivered on equipment, tactics and compass from time totime, as groups are nearing the completion of their training.The first five classes (i.) to (v.) are carried on under British personnel,&apos; asfollows: (i.), (ii.) and (iii.) One officer and four other ranks : one of the latter ispermanently with (iii.). The remaining three other ranks are inter-changeable between (i.) and (ii.), in accordance with requirements.(iv.) One officer.(v.) One officer.Russian instructors are selected out of the best pupils and retained forvarying periods with all all classes.All tanks are retained by the British until a sufficient number of Russiansare qualified to take over a section of tanks, when the latter are fully equipped, aslaid down by Tank Corps A.F., T.Q. 14.Other stores are issued from the British equipment store to the variousclasses, as required.rXXIII.-Naval.-The Caspian Sea.111. The transfer of the Caspian flotilla to General Denikin was completed on the27th August, 1919, when Commodore Norris struck his broad pendant on the &quot; Kruger,&quot;which then became the ship of Captain Sergeiev, the Senior Russian Naval Officer inthe Caspian.A full report on the formation and operations of the flotilla whilst it was under hiscommand has been furnished by Commodore Norris to the Admiralty, through theRear-Admiral Black Sea, and you have doubtless seen it. It only remains for me tosay that General Denikin and his forces appreciate to the full the splendid work andgallant fighting qualities of Commodore Norris and the officers aud men of the RoyalNavy who served under him, and of the Royal Naval Air Service under Colonel Bowhill,who co-operated with such excellent effect in both land and sea operations aimed at thecapture of Astrakhan and the neutralization of the Bolshevik fleet.112. The fuel question makes it almost imperative for the Bolsheviks to threatenGeneral Denikin&apos;s supply of oil from Grozni and to attempt to reach Baku, in order toget some of the vast accumulation of oil at that place.Their flotilla was held in check and defeated at Fort Alexandrovsk by CommodoreNorris at a time when Tzaritzin was still in their hands and when they were eonse-quently able to make full use of their naval strength.113. The British withdrawal was exploited by the Bolsheviks as a sign that wewere abandoning the cause which we had hitherto been supporting, and it has been thesignal for risings and intrigues which are causing considerable embarrassment to GeneralDenikin.
114, The Russian Navy, never an efficient service, has lost a considerable numberof its officers by assassination, and many of its sailors now constitute the most desperateelement in the Bolshevik forces.115. Service in the Black Sea was always popular with the Russian Naval officers;it contained charming resorts and was looked upon as a Russian lake, to be linked someday with the open seas by the occupation of Constantinople.116. The Caspian Sea was a backwater to which nobody wished to go. AdmiralGerassimov, Chief of General Denikin&apos;s Naval Department, dreams of a new RussianNavy to be formed in the Black Sea, and he did not appreciate the strategicalimportance of the Caspian Flotilla, although it was frequently pointed out to him.117. Early in September, on his way home, Commodore Norris paid a visit toGeneral Denikin and impressed upon him the importance of the flotilla which he hadjust handed over. He gave General Denikin a clear account of the task to be performedin containing the Bolshevik fleet and of the personnel, required to man the flotilla.118. General Denikin gave orders for the necessary action to be taken, butAdmiral Gerassimov, with his eyes on the Black Sea, did not act. I had to report thisto General Denikin, who took very firm action, and the necessary reinforcements werethen sent to the Caspian Sea from the Black Sea.119. Commander Watson, who volunteered to remain with a number of ratings atPetrovsk to assist in instructing the Russians in the use of our guns and material, nowreports very favourably on the handling of the Caspian flotilla by the Russians.Captain Sergeiev is a keen and energetic officer who keeps his ships at sea. Someof the older British 4-inch guns have been replaced on ships by Russian 5-inch guns oflonger range.120.

122. Commander Watson&apos;s party consists of 7 officers and 42 men. Of these1 officer and 1 man are remaining temporarily with the flotilla to give final instruction,1 officer and 15 men are volunteering for further service in South Russia under theMission, Commander Watson and three men will be employed in erecting the 25 kw.Wireless Telegraphy Station at Kharkov, and the remainder, who are non-volunteersare being sent home.XXIV.-Volga Flotilla.123.

It will be developed as soon as Astrakhan falls, unless all the craft now there aredestroyed by the Bolsheviks.124. It will be necessary to assist the Russians in the formation of this riverflotilla, by instructing them in the use of our naval guns, and by providing them withthe necessary technical experts to enable them to keep the guns in action.XXV.-Black Sea.125. The assistance given to General Denikins forces on the Black Sea by theBritish Black Sea Fleet, under Rear-Admiral Culme-Seymour, has, from the time of itsco-operation in the defence of Kertch to the capture of Odessa, been of incalculablevalue&apos; and is fully appreciated by the High Command. The contrast between thewhole -hearted sympathy of our officers and men and the efficient manner in which theunfortunate refugees were evacuated from the Crimea, as against the mercenary andunsympathetic conduct of the French and the chaos of their evacuation, will never beforgotten by upper class Russians as a v/hole.126. In the Russian Navy, however, there is some bitterness towards us, due to aconsciousness? of their inferiority and failure. The appointment to Sevastopol byKolchak of two of his Admirals, imbued with the Black Sea tradition, is allowing thisfeeling to come to the surface. The internment of the battleship &quot; Volya,&quot; which wetook back from the Germans, our refusal to allow Russian submarines to cruise beyonda small radius from Sevastopol, and the sinking of some of their best ships in the Baltic,are being taken as evidence of our wish to hamper the reconstruction of a powerfulnavy.XXVI.-Naval Guns and Stores.127. The Rear-Admiral, Black Sea, has been asked to supply a quantity of navalstores for the Russian ships in the Black and Caspian Seas, and for the Volga flotilla,and I understand that he is supplying all the stores requested.128. The following naval guns and ammunition for them, in addition to the gunsat Petrovsk and on the ships of the Caspian flotilla, have been handed over to GeneralDenikin for his navy and for armoured trains, &amp;c. : Guns.

129. Still more naval guns on all round mountings are, however, urgently requiredfor armoured trains, which play so large a part in this type of warfare, and will play astill larger part as movement is restricted,&quot; by mud and snow, to the railways.General Denikin asks that the following may be provided in addition to those he hasalready received : 12-pr.   ...      ............      ... ... 374-inch  ...      ...      ...      ...     &quot;...      ... ... 754*7-inch..............&apos;..... ... 406-inch   ...      ...    1 ...      ...      ...      ... ... 35With the ammunition demanded in my Q. 470 of 9th September.XXVII. Naval Section op Mission.130. Naval personnel is required for assistance in mounting these guns and forshort instruction in their use. Besides the river craft for the Volga and Dnieper, the6-inch battery at Tzaritzin, which keeps the Bolshevik flotilla in check, the 6-inchbattery at Petrovsk, and the three armoured train centres at Tzaritzin, Kharkov andKiev, require assistance.I accordingly recommend that the following establishment, which is shown inDraft War Establishments, Appendix A, may be sanctioned : Rank or rating.Number.Duty.Captain......CommandersLieut-CommandersLieutenantsE n gineer Lieut. - Co i nmanderEngineer LieutenantsPaymaster LieutenantGunnersPetty officersLeading seamenAble seamenOfficers&apos; stewards, privates, RoyalMarine Light Infantry.Chief engine-room artificersEngine-room artificersChief armourersArmourers -.ShipwrightsYeomen signals   ..Leading signalmenSignalmenPost Office telegraphistsLeading telegraphistsTelegraphistsWriterTotal122513121051214321103As Naval adviser.1 in charge erection wireless telegraph station at Kharkov;1 in charge preparation of Volga flotilla.1 as Naval transport officer, Theodosia; 1 as Naval transportofficer, Novorossisk.1 as assistant Naval adviser ; 1 each preparation Dnieper flotillaand Naval 6-inch batteries at Petrovsk, Tzaritzin and Kiev.As technical assistant to Naval adviser.1 for supervision armoured trains ; 1 each for preparation Volgaand Dnieper flotillas.As secretary and cypher officer for Naval section of mission.As Naval equipment officers at Theodosia and Novorossisk.1 for each Naval equipment office; 1 for Volga flotilla; 1 forDnieper flotilla; t each for 6-inch batteries and armouredtrain groups1 (L.T.O.) for Kharkov wireless telegraph station; 2 for eachNaval equipment office.1 for Volga flotilla; 2 as chauffeurs-; 1 for Dnieper flotilla;1 each for 6-inch batteries and 1 for each Naval equipmentoffice.As officers&apos; batmen.For armoured train groups.4 for armoured train groups; 1 each for Dnieper and Volgaflotillas.For armoured trains.1 each for 6-inch batteries and 3 for trains.2 for Volga flotilla; 2 for Dnieper flotilla: 4 for armouredtrains.1 each for Naval signal station at Theodosia, Novorossisk.1 each for Naval signal station at Theodosia, Novorossisk.2 each for Naval signal station at Theodosia, Novorossisk&quot;;1 for headquarters.1 each for Naval wireless telegraph stations, Taganrog, Tlieo-dosia, Novorossisk; 1 for erecting wireless telegraph stationKharkov.2 for wireless telegraph station, Taganrog; 1 for wireless tele-graph station at Petrovsk, temporarily.1 for each Naval wireless telegraph stations, Theodosia andNovorossisk.For headquarters.

Expansion of Front and consequent Decentralization.132. At the time of writing my last report, the Terek and Daghestan Army was-in process of formation, and merely had two columns engaged in the Astrakhan direction.Eisings in Daghestan and Chechnya, fomented by Turkish and German agents anddirectly aided by the Azerbaijan and Georgian Governments, have increased the areaand scope of this army.Its commander, General Erdeli, has been given command of the troops in.Transcaspia, and charged with negotiations with Azerbaijan in his capacity as Governor-General of Terek and Daghestan.133. The Caucasian and Don Armies have been bearing the brunt of the offensivelaunched by the troops released from the Siberian front, and, fighting with varyingsuccess, have slightly contracted their front.134. The Volunteer Army, which had then just taken Kharkov, and was pushingout weak detachments to the Dnieper, has since advanced to within 25 miles of Orel inthe north and spread to the Dniester in the west and has taken Kiev.The area of the operation of this army was thus increased to 250,000 square miles,and to the military and economic problems which its commander had to face was addedthe delicate matter of satisfying the genuine desires of the population of the Ukrainafor local self-government, while standing out against the more or less artificial movementfor independence, and the negotiations with Rumanians, Poles and Galicians imposed aheavy burden on him.135. The troops in the Ukraina have now been taken away from the VolunteerArmy and two army districts have been formed; one, with headquaaters at present atKherson under General Shilling, is called the Novorossisk (or Novorossi) Army District,.as the original troops forming it came from Novorossisk. The other, the Kiev ArmyDistrict, has been placed under General Dragomirov, General Denikufs most trustedlieutenant, to whom have been entrusted the dealings with Galicians and Poles.
Q 1XXIX. Liaison Group System.136. In nay report for 8th July three liaison groups were provided for : (1.) The Terek and Daghestan and Caucasian Armies.(2.) The Don and Volunteer Armies,(3.) The Azov Dnieper Group, which was then in process of formation.At that time the headquarters of the Don Army was at Novocherkask, and of theVolunteer Army at Rostov, about 1 hour 15 minutes apart by train ; but the success ofGeneral Denikin&apos;s operations resulted in the headquarters being advanced to Milerovoand Kharkov respectively, and it became impossible for one small staff to supervisethese two groups. I had, moreover, discovered in my visits to the front that the DonArmy supply services were particularly bad. ] accordingly telegrajmed (No. A. 339 of16th August), asking for another group for the Don Army.   This was sanctioned.137. Since then the Terek and Daghestan Army has become involved in suppressingrisings among the hill tribes (paragraph 235), and the interacting military and politicalproblems in Daghestan and Chechnya demand the continual&apos;presence of a Staff officerof experience. Lieut.-Colonel Rowlandson, General Staff Officer, 1st Grade, 1st Group,who-was on Intelligence duty under General Dunsterville, and, while serving under theGeneral Officer Commanding, Baku, had much experience of the mountain tribes, is themost suitable officer for those parts; but his presence there renders it impossible forhim to supervise the part of the staff of his group which is with the Caucasian Army.This involves the formation of a small new group. I also propose that this group shouldmaintain liaison with Trans Caucasia, and consider that the following establishment,which I have asked for by telegraph, is the minimum for the purpose : North Caucasus and TransCaucasia Liaison Group.1 General Staff Officer, 1st Grade.1 General Staff Officer, 3rd Grade.1 Staff Captain.2 Intelligence Officers.138. The Azov-Dnieper Group, wmich became the 4th Group when the Don Groupwas sanctioned, was projected before the unexpectedly rapid advance in the Ukraina.139. The area of this group is now very large, comprising nearly all the Ukraina,and contains the following ports where bases or transfer stations are being established :Mariupol, Berdiansk, Theodosia, Sevastopol and Odessa. It also contains two ArmyDistricts, with headquarters at Kherson and Kiev (vide paragraph 135), the adminis-trative services of which will need much assistance in their expansion.Relations with the Rumanians, Galicians and Poles, and operations againstPetliura and the many bands of brigands which infest the country, render it imperativethat His Majesty&apos;s Government should be kept well informed and able to refute themischievously inaccurate reports sent in by American and French officers with Petliura,The necessity for strengthening this group has been recognized in the War OfficeMemorandum enclosed with D.O.M.I.R. of 1st September.In view of the area, the length of communications, the number of ports and theimportance of the questions involved, I consider the following establishment, which Ihave asked for by telegraph, the minimum required to deal with this area : G. Q.1 General Staff Officer, 1st Grade. 1 Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster -1 General Staff Officer, 3rd Grade. General.3 Intelligence Officers. 1 Staff Captain.5 Q Liaison Officers.140. I consider that Lieut.-Colonel Goodden, O.B.E., of the Rumanian MilitaryMission, who, as i understand, is available, would be a very suitable officer for GeneralStaff Officer, 1st Grade, and request that he may be sent out as soon as possible.141. The revised War Establishments for liaison groups is attached as Appendix A,Sheets 1-5.XXX. Morale of Armed Forces.142. The morale of the old officer regiments which formed the nucleus of the firstVolunteer Army was splendid, but now, though these regiments are still very finefighting material, they have lost so heavily and are so - diluted with more recent
-volunteers that they are by no means equal to the regiments which cleared the NorthCaucasus and held the Donetz Basin against ten times their own number. The GuardsComposite Regiments, infantry and cavalry, and two composite cavalry regiments, havea full complement of officers of the original regiments from which they take their titlesand numbers, and are first-class fighting units.These revivals of the old army constitute 10 per cent, of the bayonet and sabrestrength of the Armed Forces, and as they are all included in the Volunteer Army,afford a very considerable leaven.143. The new units of the Volunteer Army are found chiefly from volunteers anddeserters from the Bolshevik forces, containing a large proportion of peasants mobilizedfrom the re-occupied districts which have experienced Bolshevism.144. All classes are imbued with the desire to finish the civil war as soon aspossible. As a rule they endeavour to out manoeuvre the enemy and take as manyprisoners as possible with the minimum of bloodshed, butwhen necessary they will fightwith the greatest desperation. This is especially the case when they are confronted byChinamen or Communist units, who also fight like fanatics.Instances of this nature have been frequently observed. Recently, at the captureof Kursk, a strong position including the station was surrounded and the whole garrisonof Communists killed to a man. The percentage of casualties in the Volunteer Armywas very high.145. The morale of the Cossacks varies considerably. There are some fine units inthe Don Army and in General Wrangefs Caucasian Army. General ShkinVs Corps,,which consists of Kuban and Terek Cossacks and Circassians, could hardly be improvedupon for dash and determination, and the exploits of General Mamontov&apos;s Corps willprobably take a high place in Russian military history, but the morale of the remainderof the Cossacks of all three &quot; voiskos,&quot; the Don, Kuban and Terek, varies from fair tovery bad. This is due mainly to the jealousies of the local Governments, who resentany attempt to regularize or control their armies. The Cossacks leave the front when-ever the)7 like for the harvest or for any other reason, send back large parties with theirequipment and loot to their stanitzas,&quot; and in action, when they do not like the waythings are going, disappear till it pleases them to return to the front again.XXXI. Attitude of Population of Reoccupied Districts and Mobilization.146. Throughout General Denikins advance his troops have been received every-where with acclamation and the most touching. scenes have taken place, especially intowns which he has freed from the horror of Bolshevik rule. British officers havealways been received with enthusiasm, and I have myself experienced this in Poltava.There can be no doubt in the mind of anyone who has entered a Russian town recentlyfreed or has ridden through the countryside and listened to their tales, that thisterrible madness was only made possible by the alien elements which have seduced anaturally kindly race and led them so far on a road the direction of which they couldnot understand. It may take generations to extinguish the results of the evil, but nopart of Russia that has experienced it in full can ever succumb again to the bestialitiesof Bolshevism.147. Mobilization orders have so far everywhere been well received. Exemptionsare made easy, as so many volunteers come forward that it is impossible for the ArmedForces to absorb all the men who would be willing to answer the call.148. Jt is more than probable that this pitch of enthusiasm for the cause may notbe kept for very long, as disenchantment must inevitably come with failure to improveeconomic conditions.149. The bands of brigands who infest the woods and even attack villages andtowns are likely to disturb the country for several years to come. All criminals haveat various times been released from, gaols, and there are many thousand soldiers also,belonging neither to the Bolsheviks nor&apos; to the Armed Forces, who have for over a yearbeen living by loot.XXXII. Economic Situation, General.150. In the winter and early spring of 1919, the area occupied by General Denikin&apos;sforces was relatively small and the economic position was not what it now is. The fewtraders who came out early in the year on their own initiative, some with cargoes,others to make offers and take home orders, had little difficulty in transacting business.In April and May, the Armed Forces of South Russia, Commerce and IndustryDepartment, sent emissaries to London with cargoes of raw materials to be sold on thet
London and other markets in order to obtain British or French currency or manufacturedgoods of first necessity. One of these, Mr. de Lara, concluded contracts, at rates ofcommission ranging from 6 per cent, to 25 per cent., for the despatch of manufacturedgoods. The contractors were to purchase at normal current prices, which were to beapproved by Mr. de Lara or his duly authorized agents. The goods were to be of thequality, class and kind set forth in schedules attached to the contracts. It transpiresthat the contracts were duly signed but not the schedules, and the Trade and IndustryDepartment has used this omission as a pretext for postponing, which is tantamount tocancelling, the contracts.151. The Economic Mission arrived in South Bussia on the 5th Julv, 1919, whenthe economic position was chaotic, thanks to the incapacity of the Department ofCommerce and Industry and the difficulties caused by the disorganized state of thecountry. It consisted of two officers only, one of whom returned to England after avery short stay in South Russia.The available rolling stock, already insufficient, could not cope with the increasedservice imposed by the steadily growing reconquered areas. The collection andexportation of raw materials to cover imports became more difficult. Trade, hithertoconducted by the Department of Commerce and Industry under Mr. V. A. Lebedev, aformer airman and owner of an aeroplane factory, who had been with the VolunteerArmy since its inception, began to assume proportions beyond the powers of hisimprovised and inexperienced staff, many of whom had their own business interests, orcreated them. Great was the temptation to under-paid or non-paid men to speculateand traffic in export licenses, and many of them succumbed to it.152. While the area was still relatively small and trade at a low ebb. with fewoffers of goods from abroad, the Armed Forces had perforce to act as merchants, throughthe Department of Commerce and Industry, and place orders direct. The troops werestill close to their bases, and the strictly military nature of the position was apparent toall. At that time it was easier for the Armed Forces to barter raw materials for the.limited quantities of goods brought by British, Italian, Greek and Levantine merchants.The latter include British merchants from Constantinople, Jews, Greeks, Armeniansand. Russian-born Jews, some of them nationalized British subjects, who have carried onfor many years a coastwise trade between Black Sea and Levant ports.153. As General Denikin recaptured more extended areas, traders arrived in ever-increasing numbers, all eager to batter. The military aspect of the situation began torecede in the eyes of the civil population at the rear, most of whom, forgetting theirpast fears of the Bolsheviks, desired to resume their wonted ways,of life. The availablerolling stock had to serve a much greater area, not only to supply the forces, but alsoto provide for the needs of the civil population and meet the requirements of trade andindustry.Fresh shipments arrived and involved the collection and transportation to the portsof increasing quantities of raw materials, against imports, which the Department ofCommerce and Industry found difficulty in handling. Private merchants also beganto seek trade. Resentment speedily set in against the department, because the exportlicenses gave them restrictive powers, which they used corruptly in favour of theirfriends or of those who bribed most freely.154. Difficulties beset the British traders who bad brought in cargoes for barter,with the result that vessels were held up at the port of Novorossisk for weeks. It is,however, only fair to add that these British traders were not of the type to establishlasting commercial relations with a country of great commercial.possibilities, and someof them brought discredit upon His Majesty&apos;s uniform, which they wore on thestrength of temporary commissions granted during the war, and used in an unworthyway in order to get the Russian authorities to help them in their speculations. Theirone object seemed to be to make a big immediate profit as soon&apos; as possible and getaway with it.At the end of July, Mr. de Laraj who had concluded contracts in London, seeparagraph 150, returned to South Russia. His transactions did not meet with theapproval of the Department of Commerce and Industry, owing partly to the changedand improved position, partly to Mr. de Lara&apos;s initiative in arranging contracts inexcess of his powers (the reason for which he stated to be the impossibility ofexchanging telegrams and the burning need of the time for goods), and partly to thewidely varying rates of commission arranged with British merchants. The provision ofthe raw materials required to cover all the imports under these contracts is certainlybeyond the powers of the department, but, even so, there is also a lack of good faithon their part. They now propose to transfer these contracts to an Inter-departmentalCommittee for Overseas Trade, for execution as and when possible, through privatefirms.   Practically, there does not appear to be any other solution.
155. For many months past, absolute chaos in commercial matters has prevailedat Novorossisk. A so-called &quot; Trading Committee,&quot; acting locally on behaif of theDepartment of Commerce and Industry, has been guilty of the grossest malpractices.Speculation, profiteering and corruption have been rife. Members of the TradingCommittee and of the Vladikavkaz Railway staff are involved. Merchants bringing incargoes were informed that they stood no chance of trading or of securing exportlicences for return cargoes unless they placed their goods at the disposal of the Trading-Committee, and pressure was applied by holding up wagons between the docks and theCustoms house for weeks at a time, in spite of the urgent need for the goods. TheBritish Economic Mission represented these facts, with the result that Mr. Vtorov, the sonof the late well-known Moscow merchant and multi-millionaire, severed his connectionwith the Committee, which was finally dissolved on 2nd August. The chief malefactor,however, Mr. Gaidukov, continued to act as the local representative of the Departmentof Commerce and Industry.. His acts became so flagrant, however, that he too hasbeen removed. It will, nevertheless, be necessary to watch events at Novorossisk veryclosely. At a conference held in EkaterinOclar on 10th July the Department ofCommerce and Industry was vigorously and courageously attacked by certain Russianmerchants in connection with the disorder and corruption at Novorossisk, but theaspersions were indignantly denied by the Chief of the Department, Mr. Lebedev. Heis accused by many, probably rightly, of participating in the proceeds of the Novorossiskcorruption.15,6. At the conference on 10th July proposals were made to make Novorossisk afree port. These met with some support, but it was finally resolved to introduce a10 per cent, ad valorem duty until the 1st January, 1920, certain goods beingexempted.157. In August various groups of Moscow merchants of good standing, includingthe Vtorov group, Riabushinsky group, and others, began to organize themselves intonew trading companies. They are antagonistic to the Department of Commerce andIndustry, both owing to the business already transacted by the department and becausethey disapprove of its Chief. General Denikin has made great efforts to find a suitableperson to replace him, but, so far, nobody will accept the post. The new groups formedare all willing to give Great Britain the preference, but state openly that, unless tradersare willing to negotiate with them, instead of trying to do business with a GovernmentDepartment which is unable to honour its bond, they will perforce have to trade wherethey can and accept what assistance is offered them whencesoever it comes. As a matterof fact, Italian wares are to be seen in the stores of the Riabushinsky group,&quot; Protosoiuz,&quot; and a firm offer was made by the Polish Economic Mission to the UnionofZemstvoson the 16th September, against payment in Romanov roubles. Germanagents are also busy.XXXIII. Economic Competition.158. The situation calls for the utmost energy and enterprise if Great Britain isnot to lose the great market Russia offers. The wealth of Russia still awaitsdevelopment and use. Her economic situation is; of course, difficult, but good andsound organizations have existed in Bnssia, with sound and patriotic men at their head,and there is reason to suppose that they will exist again. There is at the present timea distinct and unmistakable pro-British tendency, but it will not last unless it isnourished. As soon as the direct need for British help passes, the benefits conferred bythat help may be forgotten. The task of acquiring a predominating position in Ptussian^trade demands all those qualities which have built up British trade in the past :acumen, energy, patience and a broad understanding of Russia&apos;s ways and needs. Theprize is a big one and worthy of untiring efforts. It is to Russia that Britain Gan lookfor markets for her exports, which, amounting to about 180,000,000^. yearly, have been&quot;so badly upset by the war.159. British competition. At present, British firms are competing with each otherby offering goods of similar descriptions but at different rates of profit. Odessa isbadly hit by the Bolshevik occupation and full of Jewish speculators making profit outof others troubles. Kiev is still inaccessible owing to the military situation. The maininlet, therefore, is at Novorossisk, which is likely, for some time to come, to prove theprincipal channel of supply. British traders are coming to Novorossisk, Ekaterinodar,Rostov and Kharkov, offering their wares in competition. It is particularly harmfulwhen, as in&apos; the case of the trade hitherto done with the Department of Commerce andIndustry, the same descriptions of goods are imported at fates of commission varying
- &apos;from a low 6 per cent, to the high 25 per cent, and 30 per cent. I suggest, therefore,that the Department of Overseas Trade should exercise supervision over outwardshipments to Russia.Foreign competition. Americans, Italians, Czecho-Slovaks, Poles and others have,or have had, Economic Missions or representatives in South Russia. The Americanshave toured the country and deposited at various centres propaganda parcels composedof boots, cloth, leather, &amp;c. The boots are of good quality, the cloth moderate, and theleather extremely poor. Italian and Polish efforts are strenuous and, if the members ofthese Missions are to be believed, will be sustained. The German agents are Italians,Jews, Russo-Germans, Swedes, Swiss, Danes and Poles. Two men, Ludendorf andLanzen, are operating via Kiev and Poland. Their efforts should be watched, andparticular attention should be directed to the germanophiie Russians and Baltic ProvinceGermans with old-standing connections who carried on a flourishing trade with Germanybefore the war.   They are sure to make persistent efforts to reconquer the market.XXXIV. Obstacles to Trade.161. Transport. Movements of goods on a big scale will be impossible unless newlocomotives are brought into the country. Railway workshops require organization andmaterials to enable them to deal with essential repairs to existing rolling stock. Theserequirements have been reported already. Enquiries are on foot to ascertain whichindustrial- concerns in Russia are able to assist in effecting light repairs. Some of the.collieries in the Donetz Basin, and a few other works, can undoubtedly render assistance,,but British locomotive works might well turn their attention to Russia.Separatist tendencies.-The economic effect of the separatist spirit in the Daghestan,.Terek, Kuban and Don regions is observable and varies in degree in each of these areas.In all cases it is a serious drawback to commerce, and the leaders seem to be unawareof the baneful effect on the general economy of the country, and of the hindrancesplaced in the way of its economic restoration. The Kuban refuses to grant exportlicences unless the imported goods are consumed in the Kuban itself. Its exportlicences, when granted, are, however, valid only to the Kuban frontier, and theDepartment of Commerce and Industry will not grant the further licences required toship the return cargo at the port of Novorossisk, on the ground that they have not hadthe benefit of the imported goods. The point of view is narrow on both sides, and amodicum of honesty and real patriotism would enable.the difficulties to be surmounted.Officials who formerly held humble positions in civil life now find themselves in posts forwhich they are totally unfitted by character and training, and they are filled withambition to fill important &quot; State&quot; posts, Avhich would .give them even greateropportunities to shape things to their own personal ends. -Until the whole countrybecomes liberated, the danger of turmoil, trouble and obstruction in the rear makes theComrnander-in-Chief&apos;s position a very delicate one and prevents him from adopting thestrong; action he would like to take. The Don Government is far more reasonable thanthat of the Kuban, because the Ataman is a patriotic Russian; but he is not able toeliminate all difficulties. The Terek Krug has been giving trouble by attemptingto impose exorbitant taxes on the oil companies working the oil lands belonging to theTerek Cossacks; see paragraph 164.162. There is also the very serious difficulty caused by the exchange. The continualdepreciation of the rouble is making it almost impossible for Russians with fixed incomesto purchase British imported goods. In the state of the world&apos;s food supply, Russianagriculture must, however, play an important part, and the natural wealth of thecountry offers.a guarantee which should suffice for those who can give credit and havethe patience to wait.XXXV.-Oilfields.163. A great amount of British capital is invested in the oilfields.164. Grozny Oil Companies. Royalties and surface taxes amounting to over28,000,000 roubles in excess of the taxes paid for the last period of working (first halfyear 1917), calculated on the basis of a similar output, have been demanded from oneEnglish company. A notice calling on the oil companies to pay within three days thenew arbitrary rates of taxation on all the companies, failure to comply involving, underthe Mining Laws in force, the liability of forfeiture of all plant and ejection from theproperty. A telegram was despatched by the Economic Section to the Ataman of theTerek Krug, pointing out that he would be held responsible for any loss or damagesustained by the British companies.    This action brought a respite, during which a
conference was arranged between the representatives of the companies, the EconomicSection, and the Terek Cossacks. The latter did not appear, but sent a delegate toGeneral Denikin, who did not receive him. It was left to the British Economic Missionto act, and a resolution was sent to the Ataman, inviting a friendly discussion with aview to finding a reasonable solution. A fresh conference took place at Rostov on25th September, and was attended by three delegates from the Terek Krug. Thedelegates were informed that the Allied Powers did not recognize their existence apartfrom an United Russia, and that their unreasonable attitude was preventing the properdevelopment of their own oil lands, which had been so great a source of revenue tothem in the past. The Economic Mission suggested that, if the Terek Krug were inneed of immediate funds, a non-committal payment might be levied on account, pendingthe final adjustment of the rates by arbitration and subsequent ratification by theMinister of War, at the moment represented by General Denikin : or that a temporaryrate for one year should be fixed, as in the case of the Maikop properties on the Kuban.The delegates left to report to the Ataman, and the question will probably remain inabeyance until it can be dealt with by the Russian Government. A fire broke out atGrozni on 6th September. Twenty reservoirs were burnt out, with the loss of3,000,000 poods of crude oil and mazout, and of about 2,200,000 poods of benzine andkerosene,&apos; Four locomotives and some other rolling stock were destroyed.165. Ural Caspian Oilfields. The Ural Cossacks have not been troublesome.The companies on the spot working on British capital have been given letters ofprotection by the British Economic Mission.166. Maikop. The Kuban Cossacks have not unduly interfered with the Maikopcompanies, which have, nevertheless, to contend with the difficulties of a general naturecommon to all.XXXVI. - Agriculture.167. Harvest. This year&apos;s harvest is excellent. The amount of wheat which willbe available for export after the crops have been safely garnered is estimated at 333,000 tons by the Food Department.1,000,000 tons by the Trade and Industry Department.1,500,000 tons by semi-official sources.The Food Department is always careful and understates its stocks. The correct figureis probably between 900,000 and 1,000,000 tons.168. Agricultural implements. The foregoing considerations emphasize thenecessity for an adequate supply of up-to-date agricultural machinery. Not only is itessential to renew the stock of implements depleted during the past 5 years, but thesupply of agricultural implements will largely contribute towards inducing the farmingpopulation to part with their huge stocks of grain, so long withheld and so urgentlyneeded not only abroad, but in many parts of Russia. Agricultural implements shouldform a fair share of Britain s exports to Russia, and spare parts should always beavailable in dep6ts at suitable points in Russia. This was the secret of the successenjoyed by the American International Harvester Company. Attempts are being madeat present to get agricultural machinery from Italy in exchange for coal, for whichpurpose Mr. Riabushinsky, of &quot; Protosoiuz,&quot; is now desirous of proceeding to Italy, afterconferring with the Italian Economic Mission. The Italians are offering 18/. per ton foranthracite, payable in manufactured goods.XXXVII-Live Stock.169. There is a great shortage of live stock of all sorts.Horses. A shortage of serviceable horses was already felt in 1917, while thesubsequent Bolshevik ravages and the needs of the troops have further diminished thesupply.   The quality of the animals now used is also very inferior.Cattle. There is a great shortage of cows everywhere. In Odessa meat isunobtainable.   At Kiev it is very scarce; beef costs 180. roubles a pound.Sheep. Sheep rearing, an industry of some importance in the Kuban and Donbefore the war, has suffered enormously from the Bolshevik occupation. Many ownershave been deprived of their whole stock.Good strains of horses and cattle are required for breeding purposes. Assistancefrom outside in this direction would contribute immensely to the betterment of farmingumd agriculture.
XXXVIIL-Coal.170. There is any amount of coal and anthracite in some districts, while othersexperience a shortage owing to transport difficulties. Colliery owners, in the DonetzBasin, offer to supply and haul coal to the ports with their own locomotives in exchangefor clothing and machinery.171. The Department of Commerce and Industry appointed a commission underthe Extraordinary Council of the Volunteer Army to fix the cost of coal. The workwas carried out hastily by engineers of the student type, who completed their work inone day, with absolute disregard for the cost of production at the different pits; and,despite the warning of experienced men holding responsible positions, presented atotally erroneous unit of cost to the Council, with the result that coal has been sold at avery low rate.   Pressure was brought to bear and fresh data are being compiled.172. The collieries are in great need of clothing for the miners (see paragraph 19,Section A, of my H. 2/703 of 8th July).XXXIX.-Belief.173. Many towns suffer from a shortage of food owing to transport difficulties anddifficulties in obtaining it from the peasants, but, though supplies of tea and colonialgoods are short, there is enough.food for the whole population if properly distributed.In some towns and &quot; stanitzas &quot; there is an absolute plethora of foodstuffs, whilst inothers, such as Kiev, the population is badly underfed.XL. Work of Economic Section.174. The British Economic Mission to South Eussia now consists, see paragraph 151,of one officer carrying the rank of temporary Major. In addition to the study ofeconomic conditions on the spot, he is charged with the duty of giving every assistanceto British traders here, but he is without a staff and receives no reports regarding homemarkets, no trade journals and no current newspapers. He is continually being askedby Russians for information which he is, therefore, unable to give.Neither has he the time to study the many industrial schemes for distant placeswhich are put before him.175. The urgent requirements are (a.) The immediate despatch of a strong Economic Mission to South Russia, asrecommended in my H. 2/703, paragraph 43, dated 8th July.(b.) A co-ordination of the mandates from the Foreign Office and the SupremeEconomic Council.In no other way, so far as I am able to judge, can the necessary work be organizedand carried out in the manner demanded by the great importance of the subject.*XLI. Requirements.176, Commission agents are not required. The future demands the presence, now,of a number of sound business men with financial and technical training who-can arrangebusiness without having to refer every question home and who are prepared to spendtime in Russia. An increase in the number of men falling over each other in theirhaste to snatch middlemeifs profits on a commission basis will do more harm than,good.177. British men who have been in charge of industrial enterprises in Russia shouldbe encouraged to get back to them as soon as their districts are freed from Bolshevism.178. Contracting firms with capital at their disposal which are prepared to financeto some degree some good schemes should have competent representatives in Russia, towatch for suitable projects. Every description of work, such as port and dock construc-tion and extension, dredging, sewerage, paving, lighting, tramways and other municipalworks of public interest, besides timber and mining developments, require constant andearnest attention.179. A higher plane of business is required than mere baiter, with its attendant?difficulties and dissatisfaction.   Barter can practically take care of itself.180. The great prize of the Russian market, a prize which General Denikin andthe best elements in Russia would like to see won by us, will go to those who are firstable to give the Russian people the necessities of life at a, price which they can afford,and this fact is perfectly -well understood by our rivals and. enemies.
181. Delivery of these essential goods at possible prices and the provision of themeans of carrying them to the necessary distributing centres by furnishing a sufficientnumber of locomotives would win this great economic prize.Adequate guarantees for future payment exist in the wealth of the country whichcannot vanish.XLII. Railw a ys.182. Temporary Lieut.-Colonel Hull, RE., arrived in South Russia as RailwayAdviser to the British Military Mission on 13th February, 1919.He was subsequently joined in April by one Locomotive Officer from England and,on 20th May, by four other officers. Three of these were to advise on traffic and oneon locomotive questions.Between the 20th May and the present date, 19 more officers and 18 other rankshave joined, making a total of 25 officers and 18 other ranks.183. The energies of the Railway Advisory Staff have hitherto been devotedprincipally to the study of the railway systems generally and to purely railwaytechnical questions, such as the state of workshops, repair facilities, condition ofworkmen, state of permanent way, condition of rolling stock, &amp;c.184. The failure of the Russian administrative services (vide paragraph 6) hasmade it imperative to devote more attention to the military railway traffic in order toensure the more efficient and speedy delivery of war.material to the fighting troops,and I am, therefore, making a change in the British railway staff (see paragraph 214).The main feature of this reorganization is the division of the railway staff into twodistinct sections, namely : (a.) A section to report on the purely technical side of the railways.(b.) A section to deal exclusively with military railway traffic, so as to ensure aspeedier and better system of delivery of war material to the troops.185. At the end of February, 1919, 3,750 miles of railway were in the hands ofthe Armed Forces of South Russia.   The mileage is now 8,830.This enormous mileage, the shortage of rolling stock, and the weariness producedby the war and the revolution imposed upon the inefficient railway staff at the disposalof General Denikin, a task to which it was not equal..186. At first a system was allowed to exist which was, in itself, opposed to thepossibility of efficient working. There was no central control, each railway worked onits own; and each of the local governments, such as those of the Kuban and the Don,had control over the railways in its own territory. It was not until July that the onlypossible system of central and uniform control was adopted by General Denikin, whoappointed a Military Director of Communications (General Tikhmenev), who worksthrough the Ministry of Ways and Communications, which supplies the necessary civilcontrol in all that relates to the technical side of the railways.187. This reorganization has resulted in a considerable&apos; improvement, but thefailure of the Russians to appreciate the principle of good administration is resulting inconsiderable friction between the regular railway officials and the station commandants,who are almost invariably military officers with no knowledge of railway working, inspite of which they have authority over the technical railway men.188. The mileage of the various railway lines at present controlled and workedby the Armed Forces of South Russia, and the state of the rolling stock on these lines,,are shown below.

The restoration of the railway bridge over the Don River near Chir opens upa very much needed alternative route to Tzaritzin. During the evacuation fromTzaritzin of inhabitants and impedimenta at the end of August, when the Bolsheviks&apos;thrust at the town looked dangerous, great congestion was caused on the single linefrom Tzaritzin to Likhaya, because at that time the Don had failed, in spite of repeatedrequests Iry General Vrangel, to repair the Chir bridge.192. Traffic. Traffic on all lines south of Rostov is restricted by the greatshortage of locomotive power and of some classes of rolling stock, notably oil-tankwagons. Only occasional trains are now run between Grozni and Petrovsk, and everytrain has to be escorted hy an armoured train because of the attitude of the hill tribes.1&apos;93. The direct route from Rostov to Voronej has been opened as a result of thecapture from the Bolsheviks of the important junction of Liski.194. Little information has so far been obtained regarding the railways north ofKharkov.   The traffic in this area is confined almost entirely to military trains.195. Locomotive potver. The locomotive situation is serious, but will be relieved tosome extent when the railway stores arrive. Principal shortages are white metal andcotton waste for axle-boxes. At present, white metal with 45 per cent, tin is being-used instead of the normal percentage of 75 per cent.196. With the capture of Voronej the main workshops of the South-EasternRailway have been recovered, but no report as to condition of these shops has as yetbeen received.197. In August, 1919, the following locomotives and wagons arrived from Americafor the Ekaterininski Railway : 10 broad-gauge locomotives.21 narrow-gauge locomotives.300 broad-gauge wagons.The broad-gauge locomotives have been erected at Novorissisk under our supervisionand are being despatched to the Ekaterininski Railway. The wagons are being erectedat Ekaterinoslav.The importance of the 1,000 locomotives cabled for in my No. Q. 233 of 26th Julycannot be exaggerated.198. As a result of the discussion on 25th July between my Railway Adviser andthe Military Director of Communications, it was agreed that (I.) No new rolling stock should be built in Russia, but that all energies should beconcentrated on repair work.(2.) Existing railway workshops should be used for medium repairs to locomotives.(3.) Locomotive building works should be put under one control and used forcapital repair of locomotives.(4.) It was necessary to place an order for 1,000 new locomotives, to be of threetypes, one passenger and two &quot;freight, the engine weights to be from 70 to90 tons.199. Piecework has been adopted in many of the workshops and shown goodresults.   It is, however, not welcomed hy the worker where supervision has been slack.200. Coal fuel. The fuel shortage is rather acute; many workshops have only (half their plant working.   The deficienc)&apos;- is due to the deterioration of miners, toshortage of pumps at the mines, to lack of repair material for mine machinery and totransport difficulties.   The large collieries are struggling to restore their workingefficiency, and the small ones are handicapped because they are off the main lines.
201. Oil fuel-Oil to the extent of 3,000,000 poods (50,000 tons) is beingtransported monthly from Grozni for the use of railways.202. There is a great shortage of oil-tank wagons and delay in emptying them.203. Special attention is now being paid to the repair of oil-tank wagons.Four hundred oil-tank wagons were lent to the South Caucasian railways and havenot been returned.   This has handicapped the transport of oil from the Grozni oilfields.204. Several million poods of oil have recently been destroyed by fire at Groznistation (see paragraph 164).205. Permanent ivay. The permanent way is generally in fairly good condition,particularly in areas recently occupied by the Armed Forces, South Russia.206. The bridges which were destroyed by the Bolsheviks have been temporarilyrepaired with crib piers, but in many cases it is doubtful if these temporary structureswill last until the spring, when the rivers will be in flood, and it will, therefore, benecessary to replace them by steel structures.207. Railway materials. The first shipment of railway stores originally destinedfor the South Caucasian railways has arrived on the s.s. &quot; Amasis.&quot;The handling of these stores will be done by locomotive officers, pending thearrival of the stall sanctioned for the purpose.The distribution has been settled after consultation with my Railway Adviser bythe Ministry of Ways and Communications, and the stores will be allotted in proportionto the rolling stock requiring repair on each railway.The private works at Kharkov and Lugansk are also receiving an allotment,because they are employed on capital repairs to locomotives.208. Railway commodities. The 20,000 suits of prisoner of war clothing havebeen distributed amongst the railways and the first shipment of stores supplied byMessrs. William Higgs and Company is due this-week. The distribution is beingarranged by the Railway Adviser according to the number of employees on each railway.209. Social conditions. Abnormal conditions still prevail amongst the workmen,who leave their work for several clays in the week to travel to the country to buy flour,which they carry back and sell in the towns at a profit of 400 to 500 per cent. Theirpay is a mere pittance in comparison with the cost of living. They have, therefore, toresort to these practices.210. The trains are loaded with a human freight of speculators, each of whomcarries a bag or two of flour, &amp;c, and, until some system of collection and distributionof food is adopted, this travelling&quot; cannot be stopped.211. The excellent harvest this year has improved conditions, and some of theco-operative societies of the collieries and large works are now able to sell flour to theiremployees at greatly reduced prices,The indiscriminate travelling of these speculators crowds the stations, which are beingused as caravanserais, with deplorable results so far as sanitary conditions are concerned.212. Special arrangements are being made by the railway authorities to combattyphus this winter.213. Feodosia Port. Feodosia is a small port and has no extensive railwayaccommodation. It has yard capacity at the port station for 360 wagons, but another300 wagons can be handled at the old station about 1 mile distant; 40 to 60wagons could be despatched daily.The port is served by a single line of the Southern Railway for a distance of220 miles to Alexandrovsk, whence double tracks run to Kharkov and Ekaterinoslav.214. StaJ)&apos;.-&apos;\ he necessity for taking active measures to ensure the delivery to thetroops of British war material has made it imperative to re-organize the system uponwhich the railway staff&apos;was formerly run. This can best be done by dividing it intotwo distinct sections ; one purely advisory, to deal with the broad needs of the Russianrailways generally, to advise the Russian railway authorities and to assist in the railwayworkshops ; the other, to pay close attention to the movement of special trains madeup at and despatched from the bases with British military stores consigned to thefio-htino- armies.   The division of duties is shown below : Railway Adviser.Advisory Section. Operating Section.Assistant Railway Adviser. Assistant Director of Railway Transport.Locomotive.  Traffic.     Stores. . Military Traffic.    Docks and Labour.    Railway TransportOfficers.
215. The establishment 1 propose is shown in detail in Appendix A 4; it allowsfor a total of 47 officers and 92 other &quot;ranks.XLIII. -Exchange.216. When this Mission arrived in South Eussia in December, 1918, the NavalCommander-in-Chief and High Commissioner fixed the exchange for Sevastopol atI pound = 26 roubles. According to the purchasing power of the rouble it should havebeen at least 80 roubles to the pound.217. The Special Council endeavoured to maintain 26 roubles to the pound as theofficial rate of exchange and were with-difficulty persuaded to give 42, the last rate atwhich sterling had been sold in Moscow before the arrest of the British community.218. The country has since been flooded with German imitations of the Romanovroubles, Bolshevik reproductions of Kerenski roubles, Ukrainian &quot; karbovantzi,&quot; Soviet,Terek Republic and other minor issues, and the Armed Forces are, perforce, maintainingthemselves entirely by the printing press without guarantee. The purchasing powerof the rouble has consequently rapidly dropped to between 1 and 2 per cent, of itspre-war value and exchange is almost unobtainable.219. It has been impossible to keep pace with the descent of tlje rouble in fixingthe Mission rate from time to time. In the beginning of October the Mission rate wasraised from 200, at which it stood for three months in spite of the market rate, to400 roubles to the pound. The market rate in Rostov straightway dropped to 640.Even 700 has been offered. I am reliably informed, however, that large transactionscannot be carried out at these rates, that they are only obtainable for small sums, andthat for,amounts of 500/. and upwards the highest exchange obtainable is 450-480roubles to the pound.220. The question is one of great delicacy and difficulty and requires the attentionof financial experts. Some action is clearly necessary if General Denikin is to behelped, but I am quite unable to suggest what this action should be.XLlY.--Warning to General Denikin.221. As will have been seen from the preceding sections dealing with the economicsituation, finance and railways, the situation appeared so serious that I considered itadvisable to warn General Denikin, ancl place at his disposal the information gainedby the Economic and Railway Sections of the Mission. I, accordingly, addressed thefollowing letter to him : (IP. 1294.) 14th August, 1919.222. &quot; Your Excellency-(1.) The British Government has sent a telegram to the following effect to theEconomic Adviser of the Mission, who has already returned to England to report: &apos;His Majestys Government attach great importance to the promotion ofeconomic well-being in the regions occupied by the Armed Forces of SouthRussia, and, as you are aware, have already taken certain measures.Failures in the past have largely been due to lack of organizing ability, andwe consider that the organization for the financing of trade and distribution. and collection of goods is extremely important.You should investigate as to what help can be given in such organization,reporting (a.) What direct action should be undertaken  by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment;(b.) What measures should be taken by Russian authorities.It has been reported that theft is common, and you should make recommendationsas to^ what steps should be taken to safeguard goods.As economic reconstruction is one of most pressing military needs, the provisionof adequate guards, even at the expense of combatant forces, seemsjustifiable,&apos;(2.) It is my duty to inform you that the experience of this Mission, from thebeginning, has been that the Commerce and Industry, Railway and Finance Depart-ments have not been conducted in a manner commensurate with their importance to(7701) F 2
the future of Russia; while private traders, who have recently come to Russia, arediscouraged by the apathy and incompetence of the officials with whom they have todeal, and with the corruption that exists at Novorossisk and on the railways.(3.) The railway situation is, in my opinion, as far as I am able to judge frompersonal observations, serious. The officials, aud particularly the engine drivers, canonly be described as &apos;neutrals&apos;; and this state of mind is probably largely due to theentirely inadequate pay which they receive, which makes it physically impossible forthe drivers and stokers to look after their engines as they should, and leads, in the caseof officials, to corruption.The whole success of Your Excellency&apos;s administration and war-like operationsdepends upon the railways.(4.) 1 attach a report by Lieut.-Colonel Hull, Railway Adviser to the BritishMilitar)?- Mission, which deals very clearly with the question of the transportation offood by railways.(5.) Your Excellency will observe the danger (a.) Attending the present system of distribution of food to towns by means of&apos; myesochniki,&apos; which encourages speculation at the expense both of therailways and of the town dwellers, and results in the waste of rolling stock,because the wagons carry only 10 per cent, of supplies and 90 per cent, ofunnecessary human freight;(b.) Of epidemics;(c.) Of ever-increasing demoralization of the railways and population owing tolack of system and control. There is temptation to railway employees totrade instead of doing their duty.(6.) The immediate steps which are necessary, in my opinion, are : -(a.) The immediate restoration of order on the railways by the issue of tickets,and the inauguration of a regular system of goods traffic ;(6.) The issue of rations to all railway employees whenever they cannot buysufficient food, and the raising of their pay, when food cannot be bought, tosuch an extent as will enable them to maintain their physical vigour.If funds at Your Excellency&apos;s disposal are inadequate, lam prepared to recommendto His Majestv&apos;s Government the opening of a credit for this purpose.(7.) In view of the belief of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the economic restorationof the recently re-occupied districts will play a determining part in the defeat of theBolsheviks and in producing that comparatively stable condition which is essential forthe formation of a new Government, I most earnestly request you to give the matterof commerce and industry and railways your serious attention, so that I may be able toreport to His Majesty&apos;s Government that you are taking steps to organize thesedepartments and to assure them that the assistance His Majesty&apos;s Government desiresto give you will be well applied towards the real economic restoration of Russia, andwill not be wasted owing to the corruption and lack of organization of thosedepartments.(8.) I am glad to be able to inform you that railway materials to the value of500,000/. are being despatched by His Majesty&apos;s Government.&apos;&apos;223. General Denikin thereupon called a conference of all the leading businessmen and agricultural experts. A five hours&apos; discussion led to no immediate definiteresults, but did much good in clearing the air and giving the more capable businessmen the possibility of seeing the matter as a whole.The unofficial meetings which have arisen from this conference promise to be ofsome use in keeping the question to the fore and preventing the business communityfrom lapsing into a lethargic aquiescence in the inevitability of chaos, in which statethey would be most liable to fall easy victims to German exploitation.XLY. The Cossack Conference.224. The Cossack Conference mentioned in paragraph 43 of my No. IP. 890 of20th July drags on. With so many little men enjoying the dignity of being ministers,and enjoying still more the loaves and fishes of office, the task of persuading them torender their benefits to a Government which does not yet exist is a hard one. Theirdislike of centralization is healthy, and the fear of its re-establishment would be well-founded if the generals who bulk largest in the public eye were to frame the new con-
stitution. This is not at all likely to be the case, as General Denikin and his Councilare pledged to call what will be in effect a Constituent Assembly, though, as the nameof the wretched body that was elected under Bolshevik machine guns and driven outbefore the members from distant provinces reached Petrograd stinks in their nostrils,they have named the body they propose to call a National Assembly. In this Assemblythe soldiers who have made it possible will naturally be swamped by the politicians whohave delayed its birth.The farther the Armed Forces advance into the real Russia the less importantbecome the bickerings of these local assemblies, which, annoying as they have been,serve the useful purposes of schools for the future political workers.The southern politicians must, then, for some time play a large role in the recon-stitution of Russia, for the majority of the &quot;intelligentzia&quot; of the north and centrehave been murdered.XL VI. - Az erbaijan.225. General Denikin has always been badly served in Trans-Caucasia. The reportsof his representatives of their dealings with British generals and of events of which wehave knowledge have almost invariably been inaccurate, and from this we can judge ofthe trustworthiness of the reports of their dealings with the shifty politicians of (heTrans-Caucasian Republics.226. I much regret that this Mission has from the beginning been given so littleinformation about Azerbaijan that it. has been of little assistance to General Denikinin this matter, and a dangerous situation, on which His Majesty&apos;s Government is ill-informed, has arisen.227. So ill-informed were General Denikins Naval and Military officers inPetrovsk that, as I fortunately learnt from Lieut.-Colonel Rowlandson, who visitedPetrovsk, and from Commander Watson, in charge of the Naval party there, theofficers of the Caspian flotilla and the Terek Cossack General at Petrovsk were actuallycontemplating an attack on Baku. General Denikin, on my representation, at oncedismissed the Terek General and issued very stringent orders to the Caspian flotilla.228. Rustambekov, the representative of Azerbaijan, who was received withsympathy by General Denikin last June and returned to Azerbaijan with assurancesthat no offensive was contemplated, has come back. He has not yet been able tointerview General Denikin, who is at Odessa, but he informs me that the AzerbaijanGovernment is anxious to come to an agreement about Daghestan (paragraph 237),which is the present frictional point.XL VII. Georgia..229. Much was hoped for from the appointment of General Baratov as GeneralDenikin&apos;s representative in Trans-Caucasia. Whatever General Saratov&apos;s capacity maybe as a commander in the field, he is a broad-minded man, with the faculty of impressingthe Trans-Caucasian politicians with his sincerity.&apos; His experiences in Mesopotamiaand India and the short time he spent in Ekaterinodar have convinced him of thedisinterestedness of our motives and confirmed the belief that it is only by Britishinfluence that Trans-Caucasia can be settled. The Bolshevik agents in Georgia speedilyrecognized that his influence was dangerous to their schemes and attempted toassassinate him.230. The two frictional points between Georgia and General Denikin Daghestanand Batum are dealt with in paragraphs 232-237 and 238-241.231. Liaison has not yet been established with the new British Civil Commissioner.XL VIII. -Daghestan.232. It is unfortunate that Daghestan, which contains the most explosive elementsof that very excitable tract, the Caucasus, should, have been the victim of the worstindecisions in Allied policy.First, we attempted from Baku to organize the country to show a front against theBolshevik Army of the North Caucasus, against which General Denikin was alsooperating, but our local command was not informed of this Missions representationsthat General Denikin should be allowed to co-operate, nor were General Denikinsofficers with experience of the country allowed to go to Baku to place that experienceat our disposal. Daghestan was then placed in General Denikin&apos;s sphere ; then he waswarned off it; then an arbitrary line was drawn through it; then, again, it was placed inhis sphere.
233. During these 8 months, Daghestan has become the Alsatia of agents workingagainst the peaceable settlement of Caucasian problems.Ethnographically and physically, and by historical association, it. is admirablysuited to their designs. The last stronghold of the Muhammadan tribes of the Caucasus,it was never completely conquered and never properly administered by the Russians.In its inaccessible valleys it contains more tribes and dialects than any similar tract.Hospitality, intrigue, loot and religion are the chief hobbies of its inhabitants. Placedas it is between Azerbaijan, Georgia and the Terek and on the dividing, line betweenEurope and Asia, where it commands the historical corridor between the two continents,to it naturally gravitated the Bolshevik agents with designs to introduce their poisoninto the East, the Young Turks with their Pan-Turanian irredentism, the Pan-Islamicfanatics, the agents of the Azerbaijan and Georgian Republics, out respectively forabsorption and the foundation of a buffer State. Lastly, German agents find here allthe elements of discord which they need for their destructive policy.234. Against this, in General Denikins favour, was the strong tribal feeling andthe consciousness of the saner elders that his policy of tribal self-government was the onehope for the conservation of tribal and religious customs.235. Tribal self-government was shaping fairly well under General Erdeli&apos;ssupervision till the recent Bolshevik outbreak, which is being encouraged by agents &apos;ofall classes. As in other parts of Russia, the doctrine preached at first is not Bolshevism.It is a frank appeal to the predatory instincts of the tribesmen, but the organization isBolshevik. The greatest danger of this movement is that here Trotzki&apos;s scheme ofstirring up the East against Christianity and the Pan-Turanian scheme of anew TurkishEmpire meet. Essentially incompatible, these two forces are in temporary alliance,and working with them are the petty local schemes of Azerbaijan and Georgia.The evidence of Georgian agents and of Georgian officers and munitions being sentto assist the Bolshevik rising are irrefutable.Azerbaijans complicity is less marked and has more basis.2B6. Again I must warn His Majesty&apos;s Government that not only are GeneralDenikins military prospects endangered by this Turko-Bolshevik threat at thecommunications between the Black Sea and the Caspian and at the Grozni oilfields, butthat in Daghestan exists the link between the two forces which are working for anupheaval in Asia.237. It is significant that Azerbaijan should have sent a representative empoweredto invite British intervention. It may be possible to meet their wishes and By aMission to Daghestan to encourage the saner tribal elements to oppose the intrigueswhich are making a political cockpit of this country, but I cannot make any definitesuggestions till I have been authorized, to consult General Denikin on his return (videtelegram No. I.P. 2178 of 7th October.XLIX.-Batum.238. The question of Batum, if not handled with firmness, is likely to lead tomuch trouble. The Russian view is that it is unthinkable that it should be returned toTurkey, that Georgia has no historical or ethnographical claim to it, and that it isessentially Russian, and large amounts of Russian capital and much labour have gone toits development. As long as we were in occupation of Trans-Caucasia, having definitelypromised to secure General Denikins rear, they were content to leave the question tothe future, but when rumours of the substitution of Italian for British occupationreached here, General Denikin began to consider the question. Unfortunately he sentto Batum a very unsuitable officer, who grossly exceeded his instructions, and muchmisunderstanding and ill-feeling arose.239. This Mission was, as has always been the case with Trans-Caucasian affairs, tooill-informed to dispel these misunderstandings, till I sent Lieut.-Colonel Rowlandson toBatum and Tiflis with General Baratov.240. With the evacuation of the rest of Trans-Caucasia completed, and the prospectof Batum being evacuated at short notice, General Denikin is faced with the problemof keeping in hand a sufficient force to occupy the province as we evacuate, with seatransport all ready, which is practically an impossibility, or, as ah alternative, to makesuch local arrangements as are possible, risking the chance of a quarrel with the localBritish Command.In any case, our evacuation of Batum would lead to open war with Georgia.241. It is very important that, meanwhile,&apos;further misunderstandings between usand General Denikin should be avoided.   This can only be done by a frank exposition
of our policy and a definition of the activities which we will permit to his representatives.I urge that His Majesty&apos;s Government should consider this question and give GeneralDenikin every chance of stating his views and examining our proposals before they areissued as instructions.L. The Ukraina.242. This question was dealt with in Section XIV. of my No. I.P. 890 of 21st July.Since then the dramatic collapse of Bolshevik resistance in the Ukraina has broughtthe question of Petliura&apos;s position to the fore.243. General Denikin informed me on 19th August that events in the Ukrainawere taking such a favourable turn that he felt himself strong enough to take Kiev andOdessa and asked me to warn His Majesty&apos;s-Government that this would bring himinto relations with Petliura. He asked that we should bring pressure to bear on theRumanian and Polish Governments to cease to support the latter.244. General Denikin&apos;s plan of campaign was to seize Bakhmach Junction on theKiev Moscow Railway and so cut Kiev off from the Bolshevik centres. He realized thatthis might result in Petliura profiting by the success of his operations and enteringKiev before him.The troops that entered Kiev a few hours before the advance guard of the VolunteerArmy were Galicians, however, who were under Petliura for operation purposes alone.They speedily withdrew and are causing no trouble (paragraph 260).245. With Petliura Denikin can have no dealings. At first an acknowledgedBolshevik, he was responsible for the assassination of several hundred Russian officers.His subsequent opposition to the Bolsheviks, of which he has endeavoured to make somuch capital, has been a farce. He claims to have had 50,000 troops under his orders,but he made no head against the same Bolshevik force which General Denikin sweptaway with 7,000.246. His &apos;vgovernment &quot; is a self-appointed body of adventurers. His officers aredeserting freely to General Denikin, and the greater part of his troops have no interestin the independence of the Ukraina. Many, indeed, are old soldiers from distantgovernments left in Ukraina on the break up of the front. They were ready to joinany anti-Bolshevik force and are deserting freely to the Volunteer Army.From the beginning Petliura enjoyed a fictitious importance from the attentionpaid him. by the French when they were seeking a new combination in the Ukraina.Latterly the position assigned to-him as a factor in the Russian question was still lesscompatible with facts.247. With large sums of money provided from German sources he sent a delegationto Paris and established diplomatic missions in all the states of Eastern Europe andcame to agreements&apos; with Rumania and the Galicians. An able impresario, he persuadedAmerican officers that his government was that of a genuine republic, and was actuallyadvised by them to take Odessa before General Denikin and so open up relations with,the United States.248. Such fantastic statements as Petliura&apos;s report that, as the Volunteer Armywere advancing they were closing churches and burning all books in the Little Russiandialect, were telegraphed to the American Delegation in Paris as facts. The fact thatPetliura was killing off Jews whenever he got a chance was, however, not mentioned.249. Petliura has probably ceased to be a serious factor in the situation, but the -bands of independent Atamans who infest the Ukraina are certain to cause much trouble.An ignorant population, to whom murder and loot have become every day occurrences,cannot be put in order in a short time. The danger of these bands is in proportion tothe organizing ability of their Atamans, and will probably decrease as movement becomesmore difficult with the autumn rains.250. General Denikin&apos;s policy in the Ukraina is consistent with his attitude to thewhole Russian question liberal autonomy within a United Russia and land andlabour measures. He has issued a special proclamation safeguarding the teaching ofLittle Russian. The question of financing the various types of schools is now underdiscussion by the Ukrainians who have assembled in Rostov.251. The great fault of General Denikins commanders in the Ukraina is over-confidence in accepting optimistic reports and bad intelligence work generally. Forinstance, the cause and extent of the Galician movement was entirely unknown tothem till they encountered General Kravs in Kiev.252. General Denikin is thus ill-informed as to events in a large tract of countrywhich is totally without police and badly provided with communications.
LI. Rumanian Support of Petliura.253. When Petliura first appeared on the scene he was regarded by the Rumanians-as a very thinly disguised Bolshevik, and, even when the French began to dally withhim, was not seriously regarded by them. When the Bolsheviks&apos; successes in Odessaforced Petliura to withdraw through Bessarabia, his troops were partially disarmed bythe Rumanians out of deference to the susceptibilities of the Poles. Polish hostility toPetliura was due entirely to his alliance with the Galicians (vide paragraph 260)254. It was only when M. Bratianu began to realize that the movement for aD nited Russia was meeting with great success and that Rumania might be confrontedwith a strong Russia intent on taking back Bessarabia (vide paragraph 256) that heconceived the policy of backing Petliura, who was willing to recognize Rumania&apos;sannexation of that province.255. Unfortunately for the future relations of Russia and Rumania, Petliura&apos;scareer was at its zenith at a time when Rumania had lost her head and was defyingthe Peace Conference. M. Bratianu was very frank about his policy. Briefly, it wasto encourage the formation of an independent Ukraina to act as a buffer betweenBessarabia and the new Russia.The light-hearted manner in which Rumania entered into this policy is&quot; almostinconceivable. Their information as to Petliura&apos;&apos;s conversion from Bolshevism, theinfluence he exercised outside the small corner ot the Ukraina which he occupied, thegeneral trend of opinion in the Ukraina, and the strength of General Denikin&apos;s armies,consisted of scanty and distorted rumours. It only needed, however, the representationof the true facts of the case by the British Military Mission in Rumania for M. Bratianuto realize the folly of the course he had been pursuing. He now described this courseas an expedient forced on him by ignorance, and not a policy, and professed hisreadiness to stop helping Petliura.LIT Bessarabia.256. It is unnecessary now to go into the historical and ethnographical rights ofRumania and Russia to Bessarabia. Needless to say, both the history and statisticspresented by either side differ considerably.257. General Denikin has wisely striven to prevent the question of the futureownership of this province from cropping up till an All-Russia Government is formed,,but he has incurred some hostility among his officers for doing so.258. Various Bessarabian societies are working very hard to stir up animosityagainst Rumania. They have ample to go on in the very foolish manner in which theRumanian Army of Occupation and civil administration have striven to crush Russiannational feeling in Bessarabia and stimulate the Rumanian sympathies of the Moldavianinhabitants. It is probable that, had a plebiscite been taken early in 1918 when theRumanian troops came as saviours from Bolshevism, and no ray of light had appearedin Russia, there would have been a large majority in favour of union with Rumania.Should a plebiscite be taken now, after more than a years experience of Rumanianoccupation, the vote would probably go the other way.259. M. Bratianu has offered unofficially to refer the matter to the Peace Conference,and General Denikin has issued orders to his officers on the Dniester to refrain from anyparticipation in agitation, as the matter is to be settled diplomatically. It is, therefore,more than probable that if the negotiations are handled wisely the Peace Conferencemay avert the war that would inevitably ensue if the decision as to the possession ofthis province were left to Rumania and Russia alone.LI 11. Tee Galicians.-260. The entry of the Volunteer Army into Kiev was preceded by some hours bythat of a body of Galician troops officered by Austrians and commanded by GeneralKravs, an Austrian general. After&apos; some heated discussion, in which each side pulleddown the flag of the other side and a few shots were fired, the Galicians withdrew toFastov. Their general then informed the Russian commander that he was only underPetliura for operation purposes and, though they were of the same origin as theUkrainians, had no interest in Petliura&apos;s desire for separation.261. He shortly afterwards amplified this, and stated that the Galicians wanted tocome into a United Russia as an autonomous unit.262. The Galicians being the inhabitants .of a district which has been allotted toPoland by the Peaoe Conference, General Denikin has to be very cautious in dealing
with them and has no intention of either accepting their aid, which is negligible, or ofentering into any discussion about the status of the kindred nationalities includedwithin the new frontiers of Poland and Rumania.LTV.-Poland.263. Every endeavour is being made by General Denikin to prevent Polishquestions from being raised, and, as the scene of operations is shifting north-west fromKiev, he hopes to avoid any incidents.264. Information regarding the activities of Poland in the Russian districtsadjoining her frontier is only just coming in, and public opinion has not begun tocrystallize on the subject.265. A Polish Mission, under an ex-Russian Divisional Commander, has arrived inTaganrog. The Chief of the Mission is a mere figure-head, the real director of policybeing a young Austrian Pole, who served in the German Army and completed thePrussian Staff courses.266. The tendency of General Denikins Staff is to underestimate the importanceof the Polish question and to regard the pretensions of the Poles with amusedcontempt.   Their intelligence from the Polish theatre is very meagre.267. There is also a Polish Economic Mission in Rostov, which is almost openly aGerman commercial venture. They have large connections in Kiev and are industriouslypicking up the threads of German and Austrian trade and forming a union for theexploitation of Western Russia. The best commercial opinion considers that for thetime, at any rate, Lodz will be the centre of this enterprise, and that one section ofGerman trade will start its penetration of Russia under Polish guise.LV. German Political and Commercial Effort.268. The Polish cover is only one of the many that Germany is using forre-establishing her economic position in Russia. Italian, Swedish, Danish and Swissagents, who are virtually German commercial travellers, are very busy, while the pettyLevantine traders are willing to undertake German business on the very favourableterms offered.269. The low rate of the mark is an enormous pull in German favour, but, in spiteof this, the terms her agents accept for initial business, to act as ground bait, can onlyshow considerable loss.270. German agents continue to spend vast sums costing them in most cases onlythe value of the paper and printing of the imitation Romanov notes, which theypopularized at the time of the occupation of South Russia, The chief recipients of thismoney are the Jewish newspapers and journalists, the many Ukrainian organizations,and the adventurers of the hill tribes.Their agents pursue many lines of policy, but all are directed to the same end, theencouragement of the deparatist tendencies of all regions and the destruction of Britishinfluence.271. Besides the subjects of Allied and neutral countries who act as their agents,there are many Germans living more or less in concealment in Rostov. These mengained their footing on the Don when Germany was protecting the flank of the DonArmy from the Bolsheviks. Among their number was an officer who had beencommandant of the town during the German occupation. He was living openly inRostov and frequently visited the Contre-Espionage Section of the Volunteer Armywhich sent inaccurate reports about him to the Armed Forces of South Russia Contre-Espionage Section. The notorious Von Kochenhausen, who had been German PoliticalAgent to General Krasnov, was also reported by the French Mission to be in Rostov.272. As Rostov is in the Don territory and the local Volunteer Army Contre-Espionage Section was protecting the Germans, it became necessary to act through theDon Government. At my instance all known Germans were arrested at the endof July. The Don. officer charged with the duty also arrested M. Landelius, theSwedish Red Cross Commissioner and Consul, a notorious German agent.273. The Commission formed by General Denikin to inquire into the matter hasnot yet submitted a report, but such organization as existed was broken up and theGermans were compelled to rely on other nationalities for their agents.LVI. The Jewish Question. &apos;274. The Jewish question is one of the most difficult which General Denikin hasto face.   On one side he is being accused in England of permitting massacres of Jews,
and, even in papers which should be better informed, the myth of the &quot; White Terror&quot;finds place. On the other hand his firmness in preventing massacres has led to theaccusation being levelled at him here that he lias been bought by the Jews, whileGeneral Mai Maevski,-commanding the Volunteer Army, is sneeringly alluded to as&quot; the little father of the Yids.&quot;275. It is an undoubted fact that nearly all the Bolshevik leaders are Jews, e.g. Trotzki (Braunstein).Stekiov (Nakhamkes).Martov (Zederbaum).Zinoviev (Apfelbaum).Larin (Lure).Yuritzki (Radomyselskii).Ganetzki (Furstenberg).Mieshkovski (Goldberg).Riazanov (Goldenbach).Chemomorskii (Chernomordnik).Piatnitzkii (Zevin).Zviezdich (Vonstein).Lapinskii (Levinzov).Axelrod (Ovtoclox).Glazunov (Schultz).Krylenko (Bram)Kamenev (Rosenfeld).Sukhanov (Himmel).Sagerski (Krakhman).Bogdanov (Silberstein).Gorev (Goldman).Kamenev (Kantz).Gurevich (Dan).Parvus (Goldfant).Martynov (Zimber),Solntzev (Bleichmann).Abramovich (Rein).Maklakovskii (Rosemblum).Bobrov (Natanson).Garin (Harfeldt).Joffe.It is also true that the papers which are hostile to General Denikin are financedby Jews and managed by Jewish journalists.276 The belief throughout Russia is universal that it was almost exclusivelyJewish brains and money which turned the amiable anarchy of the original revolutioninto this terrible war of annihilation which is so alien to the easy-going Russiancharacter.277. At first, the Jewish question was not to the fore. There are practically noJews in the Kuban and they had never been allowed on the Don, except in Rostov.Rostov Jews at first played a very smallpart in the life of the town, but when thedefections of the Don Cossacks resulted in a serious threat to Rostov, an undergroundBolshevik printing press was discovered with proclamations ready printed givinginstructions to whom to apply for all matters when the town fell into the hands of theBolsheviks. All the commissars named were Jews. Resentment against the Jews wasfor some time very high, but General Bogayevski, the Ataman of the Don, gave aguarantee that there would be no pogroms, and popular excitement was allayed.278. As the Volunteer Army advanced through the Donetz Basin and beyond toKharkov, reports were received everywhere that the demoralized Bolshevik troops andthe country people were killing Jews. This invariably stopped as the Volunteer Armyoccupied the country.In spite of it being the Volunteer Army that saved the Jews, the latter frequentlyspread the report that they were being massacred by them. I, myself, was a witnessof an attempt by the Jews of Poltava to spread an alarm that a pogrom was takingplace when nothing of the sort was happening and, on arrival in Kharkov by the firsttrain to reach that place, I found the town full of reports that terrible pogroms weretaking place at Poltava.279. It is very different with the Atamans who are hostile to Denikin, theevidence of whose activity in killing Jews is taken from their own reports. Petliura&apos;sfollowers boast of 15,000 victims in 120 places in the Ukraina. Sokolovski claims0,000 victims in 62 places, Zilienii, 500 in nine places; Struk, 1,000 in four places&apos;Sokoloff, 2,000 in 38 places; Grigorieff, 6,000 in 40 places; Yashchenko and Goluba,1,000 in 16 places, while Makhno&apos;s victims are unnumbered.280. In all the recaptured towns,, especially in Kharkov, Poltava, Ekaterinoslav,Odessa and. Kieff, the &quot; Extraordinary Commissions&quot; have perpetrated horrors withoutparallel in history. In all these orgies of murder and torture the moving spirits havebeen Jews and Jewesses. In not a single instance have I been able to hear thatsummary justice was executed on, these monsters. In Odessa they were placed in ahouse near the scene of their bestialities, and Avhen the populace demonstrated outsidethe house in which they were confined, were moved under escort to a safer place.281. So strong is the feeling against Jews among people whose relations and friendshave been tortured and murdered that the example of the anti-Denikin forces is certain
to be imitated by his exasperated followers when away from the discipline of his strongerofficers. It is not the least of the services to humanity of that fine, strong characterthat he has hitherto prevented the natural and inevitable revenge of classes which havesuffered so long and so deeply, and it is cause for deep regret to British officers whohave witnessed the forbearance of General Denikins followers that in England credenceis given to his calumniators.LVII. Bolshevik Morale.282. The morale of the Bolshevik forces is steadily deteriorating. While the fewCommunist units still fight like fanatics, and the Chinese and Letts, who know theywill get no mercy if taken, fight well, the great bulk show much reluctance toadvance and surrender whenever pressed. In the present offensive, which has lastedjust over 5 months, General Denikin has taken more than 250,000 prisoners, 700 guns,1,700 machine guns and 35 armoured trains. Besides prisoners the Bolsheviks havelost probably an equal number in deserters, and the territory occupied by them is full ofarmed bands of desperadoes.283. In order to fill their ranks the Bolsheviks resort to the most brutal methodsof impressment; but, when once the conscripts are assembled, treat and feed them welltill they are sent with little or no training to front formations.284. In the cavalry raids of the last 2 months over 80,000 young conscripts havebeen released by the Armed Forces cavalry and sent to their homes with instructions totell their people that the Bolshevik power is waning and the war nearly over.285. General Mamantov, on his raid, also enlisted a division of 13,000 volunteersfrom the Bolshevik troops who surrendered, almost without firing a shot. Britishofficers who have seen this division say that they are magnificent physically, but a wildlot, officered by ex-officers who had been compelled to serve in the Bolshevik ranks.286. Very many other officers have come over, and all tell the same story ofattempts by the commissars to introduce a brutal discipline, which always fails, becausethe only elements, bar the Chinese, on whom they rely the Communists themselvesrefuse to accept any discipline.287. At the Bolshevik headquarters amiable theorists continue to issue pamphletsand newspaper articles on discipline and training,,some of which could hardly be bettered,but their efforts meet with no success.288. Nominally each unit, down to companies, has a &quot;polcom&quot; or politicalcommissar., who, besides being a spy on the unit, is supposed to lecture twice a week onpolitics and to run political and news club. In reality, few small units at the fronthave their &quot; polcoms.&quot; When they exist, they are invariably town workmen, who haveno influence over the peasant conscripts. Practically all the &quot;polcoms&quot; from divisionsup are Jews.289. The prisoners and deserters officers and men who have been examined byBritish officers have, if they have served any length of time in the Bolshevik forces,reached an extraordinarily low level of degradation. Many of these officers areprisoners who got away from Germany after the Armistice and fell into Bolshevikhands. Five years of ill-treatment and deprivation of all decencies of life has reducedthem, in many cases, almost to the level of animals.LVIII. Economic Situation in Sovdepia.290. In Sovdepia, as the territory occupied by the Soviet (from Soviet Deputatov)is called, economic conditions are in a terrible state. So bad are they that they maywell exercise a determining influence on operations this winter.291. Lenins policy of destroying all the machinery of civilization, though it hasnot been carried out in its entirety, has gone far. Money has ceased to have anymeaning; and the commercial and industrial institutions, which might have developeda system of barter, have been destroyed or so dislocated as to prevent their being-turned to this use.292. The labour and factory decrees, designed to introduce a communist regime,iiave, as their own papers admit, resulted in only 3 per cent, of their factories remainingopen, and these 3 per cent, produce less than 20 per cent, of their former output.Russia never had large stocks of manufactured goods, and now all necessities of life arelacking to an incredible degree. i293. It is, however, in the distribution of food and fuel that the gravest dangerthreatens. The best corn land and all the coal and oil are now in General Denikin&apos;spossession, or cut off from the Sovdepia by his forces.
294. The harvest in Russia has been so good this year that even the comparativelysmall area of corn land left to the Bolsheviks would probably suffice to feed thepopulation of the Northern and North Central governments which do not grow enoughfor themselves, but collection and distribution need organizations which it has beenLenin\s policy to destroy. It needs organized force to make the peasant part with hisgrain for paper which will purchase nothing, organized force to get the grain to thetowns, and organization to distribute the grain to the starving poor. These unfortunatetownspeople are mocked by receiving for a half clay&apos;s unskilled work more than ahundred times what they received for a full day&apos;s work before the revolution, and withtheir large wages are able to buy nothing.295. Small wonder that the &quot;Bagmen&quot; (paragraphs 210 and 222, Section V.)of South Russia, who have to leave the towns by train to buy flour are, in Sovdepia.&apos;replaced by desperate bands of men, often armed with machine guns, who carry outregular foraging expeditions often as far as -300 miles from their towns.296. Desperate as the food position is, it is probably the lack of fuel that willterminate the Soviets power in Central Russia. Already all trains except troop andfood trains have been stopped.. There are no reserves of coal or oil in Sovdepia, andmost of their engines have been converted for wood. This does not entail muchdifficulty in the areas where there are forests, but much of their railway system lies inwoodless country and the organization for cutting and haulage is so deficient that eventhe reduced running which they now manage cannot be continued much longer.LIX. Pressure op Bolshevik Troops from Siberian Front.297. The following troops from the Siberian front have already been - identified :21st, 20th, 25th and 27th Divisions.298. In addition to these there are other unidentified units on the Volga front anda Lettish division of 9 regiments has arrived from an unknown direction; the 4thand 10th Armies have also received drafts. In all there are about 80,000 troopsconcentrated on a front of 45 miles from the Volga to the-Don for the offensive onTsaritzin, but there are indications that, great as is the importance of the Volga-waterway to the Bolsheviks, they can no longer strip the Siberian front in its favour.-LX. Release of Troops from other Fronts.299. The only troops from the Baltic front so far identified are the 10th Division.NIo troops from the Polish front have so far been identified, but it is known that ordershave been issued for the strengthening of the Volga front and what is now coming to beknown as the Moscow front. This has been confirmed by deserters, but none are ableto state what units are under orders.300. The Russian Staff hazard the guess that not more than 40,000 will be availablefor these fronts. It is, however, extremely unlikely that 75 per cent, of the troopsmoved will arrive, as desertions on the way have always been frequent; in some caseswhole units sent having disappeared.301. Again, the lack of fuel is so serious and the disorganization of the railways soadvanced that such movements of troops must be attended with great delay. It iscalculated that to move a division from the Archangel front to the Volga front wouldtake nearer 6 weeks than a month.LXI. Bolshevik Objective in Asia.302. All indications point to the conclusion that Trotzki, at least, realizes that theRolshevik bolt is shot in Europe, and that, if their work of destruction is to be carried-on, it is to the virgin fields of Asia that they must turn.From the very beginning of the Bolshevik regime special attention was paid toBritish achievements in the East. No efforts were spared to stir up the people againstBritish Imperialism, but the information and the line of attack was at first German.The assembly of agents of the Central Powers at Brest-Litovsk gave Trotzki the chance, of getting into touch with the Committee of Union and Progress. Little came of theirieonnection for some time, and the British occupation of Trans-Caucasia put a st6p tothe alliance.303. Trotzki, however, had always a hankering after Eastern adventures, and soonfound in Kerjhentzev, who had lived many years in England and had a wide knowledgeof all anti-British movements in Asia, a capable lieutenant.
The British withdrawal from Trans-Caucasia, and the revival of Turkish nationalismhave given them another chance which they have not been slack in seizing, One lineof the movement is centering in Daghestan (vide paragraph 233 et seq.), while theother has resulted in the exchange of missions with Afghanistan, and in theAfghan Avar.304. This unhallowed alliance of two incompatible forces is aimed exclusively atthe British position in the East. As Trotzki has said, the road to London lies throughKabul and Delhi. The alliance was neutralized by our occupation of Trans-Caucasia,but this safeguard is gone and General Denikin is now fighting battles on our behalf-on the Yolga and on the road to Moscow.305. Though the defeat of Bolshevism in European Russia will rob the EasternBolshevik adventure of the prestige of success, it will not scotch it altogether, and wemust be prepared, if circumstances prevent our acting in a manner worthy of ourachievements in the East, for such upheavals in India as may seriously hinder theorderly development of Indian affairs.306. Again, I must ask that His Majesty&apos;s Government be warned thatunco-ordinated representation and piecemeal treatment of this vital matter can onlyresult in loss of opportunity and confusion, while much could yet be done, even withoutthe backing of physical force, by a clear and decisive policy which should result fromco-ordination of effort.LX1L The Outlook.307. The Armed Forces of South Russia will win, because (a.) They are fighting for a cause which is just, and for objects which are soundand possible of attainment.(b.) They have the best of the surviving officers of the old Imperial Army totrain and lead the troops.1 (c.) They are greatly assisted by the war material furnished by Great Britain,and are daily receiving signs of recognition from other Powers. AFrench Mission under a full general is on its way, Polish and ItalianMissions are already at General Denikins Headquarters ; Roumanianliaison officers, accompanied by a British officer, will shortly arrive, andthere is a continuously growing tendency in all quarters to recognizeGeneral Denikin as a worthy representative of the future Russia..308. The Bolsheviks will lose, because (a.) Their theories contain within themselves the germs of their own destruc-tion.(b.) Their armies are held together by lies and brutality,(c.) Their leaders are mostly aliens, who will be found out sooner or later bytheir dupes.(d.) They are destructive, and not constructive.309. The date at which the final decision will be reached is difficult to determine.Some of the factors bearing on the question are (a.) The morale of the opposing forces and of the people.(b.) The relative strength of the opposing forces.(c.) The economic situation on both sides.(d.) The climate.(e.) Distances.(/) Outside influences.310. As regards paragraph 309 (a), Bolshevik morale is dealt with inSection LVII.; the morale of the Armed Forces of South Russia in Section XXX.;and the attitude of the population of the re-occupied districts in Section XXXI.311. As regards morale generally, it must be kept in mind that this is not aregular war or even an ordinary civil war between two well-defined parties fighting fora definite end. In this struggle the moral is to the physical more nearly 10than 3 to 1.312. On one side there is an amorphous mass of apathetic and ignorant peasantry, &apos;whose one coherent idea is to possess the land, a comparatively small class of almostequally ignorant workmen with ill-digested ideas of the Marxian type and a smallquota of fanatics whose theories range from Marxism to pure nihilism.   Swaying theseill-assorted elements is an inner ring, nearly all of whom are aliens.

Of General Denikin&apos;s forces, about 50,000 sabres and rifles are detached todeal with Petliura and with the other bands of brigands infesting the Ukraina ; Avith-the hill tribes; and with Georgia and Azerbaijan, in the event of active hostility fromthese &quot; republics.&quot;318. Difficulties connected with the clothing and equipment of recruits are the onlyconsideration which limit the number of men whom General Denikin could mobilize.319. As regards paragraph 309 (c), the economic situation in &quot; Sovdepia &quot; is dealtwith in Section LVIII. of this report. The economic situation in the country reconquered,by General Denikin is dealt with in Sections XL, XII. and XIII. of my H. 2/703 of 8th July, 1919..Section Q of my H. 3/703 of 21st July, 1919.Sections XXXII.-XLIV. and LV. of this report.The economic situation, considered in conjunction with the climate, is dealt Avith inparagraph 320.320. As regards paragraph 309 (d), in South Russia the winter is -severe. Itcommences with rain accompanied- by cold winds in October. There are hard frosts inNoA^ember and heavy falls of snow in December, after Avhich the temperature variesbetween 15 and 45 degrees of frost, according to locality and weather, until March,when the thaAV sets in. The period of rain and mud, during which all rivers are floodedand roads become practically impassable, lasts for about 3 weeks. The countrythen freezes and road traffic becomes easy for about a month until snow falls, whensledges have to replace wheels. The average snowfall is about 3 feet, but broadand deep drifts often block roads and railways and frequent stormy winds fill railwaycuttings and sunken roads with driven snow. Rivers freeze after the main fall of snowand can then be crossed by heavy traffic.313. The strength of this inner ring consists in the skill with which they appeal to-the genuine desires of all these classes, incompatible though they are, and persuadethem that the triumph of Bolshevism Avill give them what they want. This skill,combined with a genius for propaganda and a comparatively high order of militaryorganization, supported by incredible brutality, gave them originally a very large andfairly efficient fighting force.314. The theory of Bolshevism, being a negation of government, and LeninV .object being to destroy all organizations of civilized life, it follows that his rule containsthe seeds of its owm destruction. Lenin boasted that he was not afraid to use hungeras a weapon, but it is a two-edged Aveapon, and is now turning on him. He hasendeavoured to destroy the organizations of civilized life, and has so nearly succeededthat he has made it impossible to maintain an army in the field for an indefinite period.315. On the other side, we have first the survivors of the officers of the ImperialArmy with all its virtues and faults gallantry and optimism of a high order marredby administrative incompetence, the incapacity for continued effort, and that casualnessand lack of foresight Avhich goes with the Slav form of fatalism. In the VolunteerArmy the officers still are in high proportion compared with the mobilized peasantryand volunteers. The latter, lacking the discipline and training of the Imperial Army,are yet good material. The Cossacks of the Kuban, Don and Terek (vid&apos;e paragraph 145)are a varying force ranging from very good to very bad.On the whole, in morale, training and organization, the Armed Forces of SouthRussia are far superior to the Red Armies.316. As regards paragraph 309 (b), the relative strengths of the opposing armiesin South Russia are estimated by General Denikins General Staff to be as follows : 
Between the meridians of Saratov and Voronejh winter begins about the middle of&quot;October.   It starts with heavy rains accompanied by very cold north-easterly winds.Frost begins about the beginning of November and snow falls towards the end ofNovember.   The rivers freeze over towards the middle of December.   There are veryheavy falls of snow in February.Between the meridians of Voronejh and Tchernigov rain commences to fall aboutthe second week of October and is accompanied by cold winds and fog. Frost sets in aweek later and heavy falls of snow occur during November and December. The riversfreeze about Christmas or during the first week in January.Between the Dnieper and the Dniester the climate is less severe. Cold weathercommences in November and frost about the first week of December, followed by snow.The rivers freeze over about the middle of January.The rainy season will render movements difficult except by rail, and willconsequently reduce the mobility of armies and make- impossible such movements asthose undertaken by Mamontov. When the ground is frozen hard mobility will berestored, but the necessity for housing the troops will result in fighting for localitiesaffording billeting accommodation.The period of frozen rivers, lakes and bogs will remove obstacles which nowcontrol operations to a considerable extent, and will make it more difficult for smallforces to hold extended fronts.321. Though the winter in Russia is severe the people are acclimatized to it andcan stand it well provided they are properly fed and kept warm. Fuel, sufficient food,warm clothing and good boots are, therefore, vital necessities, and without them thearmy especially would suffer intensely, incur big losses from frostbite and lung disease,and lose morale.322. As regards fuel, Denikin will be in a very strong position if he can protectGrozni and deny Baku to the Bolsheviks until the Volga freezes in December. If&apos; Grozni is lost he will have to convert one-third of his locomotives now using oil. Thiswould take time and dislocate traffic, which is already insufficient. Sufficient coal isavailable in the Donetz Basin, but it cannot be transported to anything like therequired extent under existing railway conditions.Very little coal or oil is available in Soviet Russia, where wood fuel is in universaluse. Stocks of cut wood are reported to be low, and from .the rainy season onwards thecollection of supplies of fuel will be difficult. This will result in decreased efficiency ofrailway communications and distress in towns, see Section LVIII.323. As regards food, the country occupied by Denikin contains sufficient food forboth troops and civilians for the winter. The difficulties of distribution are, however,great, and sufficient railway traffic can alone ensure the necessary distribution to avertdistress. So far the Bolshevik armies have been well fed, but there is a great shortageof food in Soviet Russia. As it has always been the policy of the Soviet leaders to feedtheir troops well, civilians will suffer. The probable result will be risings and riotsbehind the Bolshevik lines.   Conditions approaching famine already exist in many towns.324. As regards clothing, about one-third of Denikins forces are properly clothed,and stocks arriving should materially improve the situation. Some of the recently-- captured Bolshevik prisoners have been miserably clad and Mamontov dispersed a vaststore of clothing in Tambov.To sum up, the winter should adversely affect the Bolsheviks far more thanDenikins armies. All evidence points to inevitable intense suffering in Soviet Russia.Of course, the further Denikin advances, the greater will his difficulties become, andthe smaller the advantage which he now holds over the Bolsheviks.Russians, generally, if well fed and well clothed, can continue to fight throughoutthe winter and their power of manoeuvre is then less diminished than might beexpected, except during the rainy season.325. The main requirements of General Denikins forces, the provision of whichwould undoubtedly give them the decisive superiority made possible by the factorswhich will be introduced by the coming winter, are, therefore : (a.) Warm clothing of all kinds, and blankets, greatcoats, waterproof sheetsand boots.(b.) Locomotives.326. As regards paragraph 309 (e), the distance from Orel to Moscow is 220 miles.If there were no resistance, trains could reach Moscow within 24 hours, provided theRolsheviks did not destroy the railways and remove all rolling stock.   In the face of
resistance, judging from the progress hitherto made, Moscow might be reached within2ij months, but 3 weeks must be added to this time on account of the weather, seeparagraph 320. But the numerous uncertain factors, to which reference is made in thisreport, and other unknown factors, make the date at which General Denikins troopswill enter the holy city one of the greatest uncertainty.327. In short, if the Bolsheviks crack, Moscow may be reached very soon. If theydo not crack, the shortest time necessary is about 3 months, but the advance willnecessarily be influenced also by the situation on the flanks and in the Caucasus.328. As regards paragraph 309 (/), outside influences will have a great bearing onthe time taken to defeat the Bolsheviks. A firm declaration by the Allies or by the Leagueof Nations that they are against Bolshevism and are determined to stamp it out, wouldhave an immediate effect.329. The engineered Bolshevik attacks on General Denikin and Admiral Kolchak,the incredible propaganda in favour of Bolshevism which is allowed to flourish in thecountries of the Allies, and the hesitating attitude of the Great Powers towards aconflagration in one part of the world, which threatens to spread and carry misery andsuffering into other regions, disheartens those who are fighting against an evil and aterror which they justly consider to be an obvious and dangerous threat to Christiancivilization as a whole.330. But even when the forces of law and order have beaten the Bolsheviks, therewill be a period during which bands of all kinds created by the general lawlessnesswhich has prevailed will have to be crushed.There will also be very difficult and delicate questions to be settled in connectionwith the ambitions and interests of the various parts of the country. The speedyrestoration of Russia to normal conditions will depend, therefore, upon the statesman-ship and patriotism of the leaders, and upon the restoration of conditions which willmake life possible for the people.LXIII. Duties and Organization of the Mission.331. I attach, as Appendix B, &quot; Rules and Notes for Guidance,&quot; which describethe organization of my headquarters and embody the allotment of duties to the variousofficers.332. I shall be unable to work the organization to its full extent until I receivethe officers and other ranks I have asked for.The position at present is given in the table in Appendix D, from which it will boseen that I am deficient of 138 officers and 806 other ranks.333. I request that 500 copies of this pamphlet may be printed as soon as possibleand sent out for the guidance of all officers. I have been unable to get it printed here.A sample of the form in which it might be printed is attached.I have the honour to be,Sir,H. C. HOLMAN, Major-General,Commanding British Military Mission, South Russia.
