THIS IOCUMSFT 13 THE PROPERTY OE HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&quot;S GOVOTMEET).I&apos; yji jet..P..-896.NATIONAL   HEALTH   IMSUBATO.4M.o iih..........      m...........aw i i mi. III.BH. i    -I    inrriM   nn   mi-       iif tn i&apos;iiiTMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Minister of Health in his recent memorandum tothe Cabinet (CP. 858) puts forward revised proposals inregard to National Health Insurance, and asks for permissionto Introduce immediate legislation to give effect to them.I have already drawn the attention of the Cabinet to theinter-connection between Health Insurance, Old Age Pensions^ee       ana Unemployment Insurance.x  I understand that the MinisterC oP* Sixof Labour is at the present time preparing a revised schemeof Unemployment Insurance on the basis of an UnemploymentBenefit of 15/- in the case of men and IB/Od. in the case ofwomen.   Dr. Addison in the scheme now put forward proposesalsothat Sickness Benefits/should be increased to 15/- inthe case of men and to l2/6d. in the case of women.   The twoschemes may therefore now be &amp;onsidered to be on similar lines.The figures fixed for either will govern both.The new Health Insurance scheme involves the Exchequerin an additional cost of  8,775,000-    I have suggested asan alternative that the workman19 contribution should likethe employed6. &quot;be inoreased by Ed. instead of Id, a coursewhich would enable the increased&apos;beriefite to be providedwithout additional cost to the Exchequer.    I recognise thatthis course presents great difficulties, but on the other hand,the difficulties of obtaining Increased contributions frominsured persons are not greater than the -difficulties involvedin imposing fresh burdens on the taxpayer at the present timethough they fall on different Ministers.In any case I regard the proposals in regard to MedicalBenefit, as preposterous.    Before the. War a doctor received onthe average 7/3 per patient.     This rate has been increasedduring
during the War by temporary measures (e,g. the grant of WarBonus) to 8/93.     In a previous memorandum to the Cabinet(CP,160) Dr. Addison1 contemplated raising the rate to lo/&quot;6d.-He no?/ proposes that the rate should be increased to no lessthan 12/-.. ?/hich would involve the Sxcbequer in an addition-al liability of  1,050,000 over ana above the cost of hisearlier proposals.   The latter rate would represent an in-crease of 66 per cent over the pre-war rate, and, in view of thefact that the War Bonus paid to doctors has hitherto beencalculated on Civil Service lines, I think that a comp&amp;Msonwith Civil Service conditions is of interest.   The presentrate of V/ar Bonus for Civil Servants represents an increaseof only 40$ on a salary of  600, 36$ on a salary of  1,000and 33.3$ on a. salary of  1,500.   In connection with theseproposals Sir J. Irishman, the Chairman of the NationalHealth Insurance Commission in Scotland, who does not mincehis words, calls the demand made by the doctors TTa barefacedSwindle&quot; representing as it doe? an income of  2400 a yearto a doctor with 4000 Panel patients, which in his opinionis not too great a number for a doctor to have under hiscare. .    The 10/6d rate is in my opinion the maximum whichshould be granted if any part of the increased charge is tofall on public funds.If eia Age Pensions are increased at all, the additionaloost to the Exchequer cannot be less than  10,000,000Unemployment Insurance on the scalecontemplated will cost about   2,250,000Dr. Addison&apos;8 scheme costs E,775,000Total 15,025,000Additional taxation would be needed for the whole ofthis sum, say 3j-d in the   income tax.
TREASURY. S.W*Deoeffiber 14th^ 1919,^I inrite the Cabinet to decide in farour of equalisingthe additional contribution of employer and employed to theincreased Health Insurance benefits.Alternatively I invite them to reduce the doctors9 rateto 10/6d which will save  1,050,000.(Initialled)      A.C.
