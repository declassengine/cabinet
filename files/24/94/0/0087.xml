The deoision to postpone action in regard toNationalisation of the coal mines was tflfcwn in order to givetime for the propaganda oampai&amp;n to achieve something likesolidairity throughout the reiiks of Labour, end perhaps thethought that the cost of living would bo cumulatively in theirfavour may have contributed tc the decision.The boasted concord of the Triple Aliianoe is built uponsand.   The friotion that is always to be icund between theprominent Labour men broke out when Mr. Robert Smillie publiolytaunted Mr. Thomas at the Nationalisation meeting on December9th as one of the leaders who had been &quot;soft-soaped&quot; by thePrime Minister,The shortage of trucks and the general lack of transportis gravely affecting all branches of industry, and is restrictingoutput. &apos;The London Branch of the Electrical Trades Unioncontemplates a series of lightning strikes against individualfirms.   This time it is not so much a question of wages asof/
2 -of foroing the foremen and oharge hands to join the Union Jfor it is realised that as long as these men have a Union&quot;of their own, the Government will be able to run theeleotriool undertakings without a stoppage during a strike,The extraordinary interest taken by the workingolasses in the BeoketV-Carpentier fight proves onoe morethat of all antidotes to revolutionary teaohlng, sport la tof the most effeotive.
Mlim-hizmm op thf, mifes .Interest this week has naturally oentred in the TradeUnion Congress; the proceedings as regards Nationalizationwere as foreshadowed in my last report, &apos;   From the leaders&apos;statements it would appear that they have no hope ofobtaining Nationalization without a strike or an election.The Congress will probably meet ag^in in February andmeanwhile the minors&apos; propaganda is to be intensified.    Itis interesting to note that the expense of the propagandais to be borne by the Miners Federation of Great Britain,the Labour Party and the Parliamentary Committee of theTrade Union Congress,THE ftklLWfflCT.There are still rumours of an early strike amongst.the railwaymen and an illustration of. these has just been&apos;received from a.French source, La Commission AdministrativePermanente du Farti-Socialists Internationale Ouvriere atV;.&apos;:-Paris is stated to have received from the headquarters ofthe railway workers at Liverpool an assurance that arailway strike would be deolared throughout England beforeChristmas and that it will extend over the holidays.Mr. Cramp is emphasising the claim for thenationalization of all forma of transport.    On December5th he said at  anbury that motor transport had a greatfuture, but there was a strong movement on foot to getthe State motor lorry service/augmenting the railwaygoods service, out.of the State&apos;s hands.in order thatprivate enterprise might come in-.-.   The people of theocimtry- mus t- be - warned against&apos;- -this.    Unless this movewas frustrated::he had visions&apos; of - railway shareholdersbeing; anxious to nationalise railways and sell out to theState in order to reinvest in the motor lorry service, and&quot;so get Some&quot;of their own back.PiiOFI TEEttlHG/
PROFITEERING.To the customary complaints regarding the high oos^living and especially of milk has been added this week agood deal of grumbling about the prospective decrease inthe butter ration.    Little oan be added to the stressrepeatedly laid in these reports on the grave nature ofunrest caused by profiteering, but the attention devotedto the matter by the Trade Union Congress on December 9t!significant.    Far-reaching proposals were made in reganto the ohief artioles of food and olothing and there coube no doubt that the determination of the delegates wasreflex of the feeling not only amongst Labour but amongslthe general public.It should be remembered also, that in the event ofgeneral eleotion to decide the question of nationalizatiiby far the most- potent Labour advocate, supposing that tlpresent prices are maintained, would be the cost of livijTHIS H0U3IN3 QUESTION.Although there is little new to report in regard tothis question discontent is still praotically universal,The statement of my correspondent in the Liverpool distimay be taken as typioal.    He writes :-&quot;All over this area there is widespreaddissatisfaction at the delay in the building ofthe new houses whioh have been promised and this hflresulted in Manohester in a revolt against theprivate oontraotors.    The City Council have decideto employ the neoessary labour for the ereotion ofI50 houses by way of experiment.    The reason forthis, it is said, is that  1,128 is the averagebeing asked for six roomed houses, whioh before thewar oould be ereoted for  200.The general opinion of the workers in this 01is that if there is a shortage of skilled labourin the building trade, as the builders oontend the)is, then the whole of the available labour ought t(be employed on the building of houses.I go into this matter at length because thefeeling on this question is real and bitter.    Thepeople say they have had plenty of promises for 12months, but there are no houses.in
In ft public house in Bradshawgate, Bolton, onDeoember  3r(* last, some oolliers were discussing thehousing question;   one said he knew for a faot thatIf any more pioture palaoes In Eolton were to be builtthere would be trouble and the brioks would be pulledaway as quickly as they were put together.To show how serious the shortage of houses is, Imight mention that the Birkenhead Corporation havereoeived over 2,000 applications for a few new houseswhioh are expected to be ready for occupation early inthe New Year.&quot;SHORTAGE OF RAILWAY THICKSxieports have been received from several districts thatthe shortage of truoks is having the gravest possible effect.Prom Cardiff, for instrnce, a correspondent sends thefollowing:&quot;I find here the solution of the whole problem&quot;of production.    The wagon repair shops are here and&quot;they are months behind in work - I went over one big&quot;shop and found no one even on the premises, I even&quot;went right round the grounds, found truoks partly&quot;repaired and not a soul working.    Truoks were in the&quot;sidings that had not been touched for 12 months.&quot;This is oonfiroed by another oorrespondert in Cardiff, whowrites, &quot;Owing to the extra strain on trucks during the war,there are a number of cripples in the repairing shops. .   Inspite of every effort made to get wagons out and intoservice again, there are strings of truoks in Cardiff dooksthat have been there for eighteen months ....   If it werepossible to ,get a move on with the repair of truoks it wouldmean thousands? of pounds to the nation, for men, mines,rail and ships.    I urgently reoommend this.   Why not try-the railway shops for repairs?  Everything should besubordinated to the trucks.11The shortage of truoks is stated to be aggravating theunemployment problem in towns suoh as Newoastle,At Hull 60,000 tonB of oil oake, urgently needed byfarmers, are. stated to be held up owing to laok oftransport,Complaints/
Complaints of manufacturers, traders , and farmers whjcannot move material ore innumerable.It is possible that the return to this country of thlrailway trucks which are not in use in France might        ^1alleviate cone of the congestion.Further enquiries into, the matter are being made.1  MjffiTHIS Ui^lff I.0YMENT DONATION.On the whole, unrest among the unemployed seems to beincreasing.    In the Newcastle area, where shortage oftruoks is aggravating unemployment, there have been a numbfof meetings and George Hardy, the Industrial Workers of thlWorld representative from America, has helped to fan theflame of discontent.    He stated that apart from thereduction of working hours, the, only remedy for unemploymewas the seizure by the ocimuhity of all plants and tools.At Woolwich, the state of the ;labour market is report!to be causing serious alarm and; it is stated that even ifdischarged men oould find work elsewhere, the lack of houelwould render a transfer impossible.The Beeston (Lee^s) branch of the National uhion offtailwaymen has sent to,.tfre Trade&apos;Union Congress a resolutioladvocating a general strike if the unemployment and dolequestions are not satisfactorily settled. ,:Liverpool is reported to be adversely affected by theoessation of the dole and there is a fairly general demandthat the Prinoe of Waies Fund should be used to*alleviate....   oases of genuine distress.    $ie Moulders&apos; strike isestimated to have thrown 20,000 engineers out.of enployment.... in,this area.    Efforts of the Munioipal authorities toassist the unemployed..have: so far met with little suooess,.......My correspondent.reports that the decision of theGovernment not to send any more ships to the Mersey for   -refitting has oaused great dissatisfaction amongst shiprepairers, especially as the ship-owners themselves are ina/
&quot;i *) ^ ha position to take on more work easily. e)*j /One of the offioials of the Mersey Ship BepairingFederation and the Federation of-Engineering andShipbuilding Trades stated that-if the Government adhere totheir decision, it will mean that soores of skilledmechanics will be thrown out, of -employment.During the past week there has, been a lot of talk andmuch resentment shown, by the large numbers of unemployedwho frequent the Liverpool Docks each morning in search ofwork, towards the Dookers.Union; for demanding an entranoefee for new members of  5,0.4., and also at their deoision torefuse to woik with non-Union men after the 8th December,Hie unemployed naturally&apos;donsider this polioy isdireoted at them and they deeply, resent it.    Large numbersare ex-service men and few,of them oald afford to pay any-thing like the entranoe fee demanded, and therefore there islittle hope of their finding ^employment at the Docks,My correspondent reports that the unemployed in the WestBiding have been less turbulent during the week, owinglargely to their sympathetic reception by the oivioauthorities.    He adds, &quot;All species of rascals and agitatorsare of course&apos; tacking themselves on to the genuine bodies ofunfortunates in the &quot;wrious districts, but, if the moulders&quot;strike was ended, there ^w6uld probably be little unemploymentin this area within a month or so.    By far the mostvociferous are the &quot;work-shy&apos;s&quot; who have&quot;, in small*numbers,been drawing the dole, but if there is no sign of theGovernment surrendering to the outcry, and if the disastrousmoulders1 strike ends, these will resume without further adotheir ordinary avocation of backing losers, etc.&quot;CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES AND THE TRADE U1TI0N3.TMs movement appears to be making headway in variousparts of London; the Edmonton Co-operative Sooiety, which&apos;covers Edmonton, Tottenham, Finohley, Hornsey, Shoreditch andHampstead, has recommended the formation of a looal JointEmergenoy/

She various &quot;Hands offBussla&quot; committees are beooming aotive; that in Coventryfor instance has decided on a 24 hours strike; in Londona &quot;permanent&quot; committee of 21 has been eleoted.On December 8th a meeting held at Hoi born Hall wasattended by about 1000 people.   Colonel felone andMr. Goode spoke in their usual pro-Bolshevik strain, andKobert Williams went so far as to say that he hoped thatsoon the Soviet President of England would pay a returnvisit to Moscow after the riusslan president had been toLondon.  He looked forward to the time when men likehimself and other labour leaders sat as representativesof the Workers1 and Soldiers&apos; Counoils in Great Britain.He did not, however, omit his customary remark that therank and file of British Labour is, oh the whole,apathetic.   When interrupted by the remark that theLondon/
London dookera were unanimously agreed on direct actionin regard to *to8si&amp;, but that the leaders were afraid totake the initiative. Williams hedged by saying thatdisjointed action would only lead to confusion - it wasup to the men to rejy on their leaders and the time wasnot far distant when the lead would be given.W&amp; INDEPENDENT LABOURPAaTY AND THE SCOTTISH UBOtfo PAiiTYThe Preliminary Agenda for the Independent labour PartySoottish Divisional Conference to be held in Paisley onJanuary 3rd, 1920, is an interesting document, if only forthe widely divergent views which it discloses aa prevailingwithin that party.   !foe iienfrew Branch put it plainly in aresolution:&quot;We are of opinion that&apos;owing to the diveraity&quot;of thought in tiie ranks of our own party regarding&quot;political and industrial aotlon, the main interests&quot;of the Independent Labour Party would be beat&quot;served by having a series of Conferences in each&quot;Federation diatriot to discuss and formulate a&quot;definite polloy, and so be able to get a closer&quot;unity of action throughout Sootland.&quot;The Independent Labour Party in Sootland does notseem sure of its allies of the Labour Party.   Seven branchesaupport the following resolution:&quot;That this Conference considers the time&quot;opportune for the Independent labour Party to aever&quot;its oonneotlon with the Labour Party, ae the&quot;compromising attitude of the Labour Party is net&quot;in the best interest of Socialism.&quot;On the other hand, five branches aupport a contrarypolicy:&quot;UJiat thia Conference re-affirma its belief&quot;in the polioy of the labour Alliance, holding that&quot;it la essential to the future progress of the&quot;Sooialist idea that the I.L.P. ahould keep in intimate&quot;touoh with the workers organised industrially in their&quot;Trade unions, and the political expression of their&quot;industrial organisation, the, Labour Party.   It is of&quot;primary importance to recognise that, faulty and&quot;comparatively inefficient as the Labour organisation&quot;has proved in the past, it is the only mass proletarian&quot;organisation in thia country whioh holds within it the&quot;potential power to overthrow the Capital State.&quot;On/

The paperreports that &quot;another sum of  lOy0OO, which was promisedfron another quarter some weeks ago, has also oome tohand.   This is a free gift to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;&apos;andthe donor in all probability is Philips Price (vide myreport of 4th December.)Matters were fairly qjiiet last week except in Munster,where the unrest in Clare and Cork is very unsatisfactory.!ttie state of tension, however, is at present very threatening.The Sinn Feiners in London are now oonc*rting measures forcorrupting the Army and the Polioe in Ireland.

But she Imagines&quot;that there would be suoh a prospeot were Sinn Fein out&quot;of aotion.   If she loses Ireland it is the end of her&quot;as a world power.

In some countiespermits are being generally applied for, even by Sinn Feinersunlikely to get them, while in other counties there isgfeater reluofianoe to obey.   Employees belonging to the MotorDrivers and Meohanios Union have generally refused to oomplyand are not driving.A further large meeting outside the City Hall, Belfast,was held on Monday, 1st instant, to protest against thestoppage of the unemployment donation,   A deputation fromthis gathering succeeded in interviewing the Corporation,which was sitting at the time, but the latter body is reportedto have refused to do anything.B.
