HIS DOCUMENT IS TH3 PROPERTY OP HIS ERITAilHIC MAJ33TY&apos;S GOVSMSIJT).P.-878,CABI.11E ToGOTOTOIT OP XHHIAJiD BILL.Memorandum by tho Postmastor&quot;General,I.   The scheme of the Home Rule Bill is vory much moresimple from tho Post Office point of view than the Actof 1914 or any previous proposals.   It provides, ineffect, that the Post Office shall remain under preciselythe same control as at present unless and until IrishUnion takes place, when it will be transferred bodily tothe Irish Government with tho exceptions of cable andwireless.2.   It should be noted that, although submarine cablesand wireless telegraph are retained under the control ofthe Imperial Government, there appears to be no provisionfor securing similar control over the land linesoonneoting tho cable heads, e.g* of the Atlantic cables,with the cross channel cables giving communication to theUnited Kingdom.   And similarly as regards the land linesconnecting the wireless stations or Yfar Signal stationswith the United Kingdom or with each other.   In 1912the Admiralty urged strongly that the Imperial PostOffice should retain the maximum possible control overthe provision and maintenance of land linos connectingthe cable and wireless stations in Ireland,   It appearsdesirable that some measure of control over land linessituated in Ireland, but required mainly for throughcommunication with Great Britain or for purposes ofImperial defence, should be preserved.3,&apos;  In the Home Kule Act, Sootion 47(c) provides for thereservation of power by Order in Council to transfer intime of V7ar or National Emergency the. powers or duties ofthe Irish Post Office to the British Post Office or tothe Naval or Military Authorities of the United Kingdom.It is suggested that some similar powers should bereserved in tho present Bill.     In the event of &quot;Tar it isclearly necessary that communications in Ireland shouldbe subject to Imperial control.(Signed). ALB3RT H.-ILLIHGWORTH.eral 2ost Office.December 10th. 1919*
