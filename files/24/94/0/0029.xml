tTH?S 10CTONT IS, THIS. PROPERTY OF HIS,-,&quot;BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVOTMT.)SB ORJ T,*  C P. 228,XMjggj GUARANTY OF BELGIUM. ,Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of St at c for. Foreign Affairs..\7hen I trought before tho./litest on November l6th thequestion of our joining France in giving a guarantee of theindependence and integrity of Belgium, it was felt to &quot;be un-dosirable to take any such step until our obligations as re**gards the defence of French territory in, conjunction withAmerioa had &quot;been finally determined.   X therefore informed SirBlyre Crowe that the Belgian question must be postponed.I think j however, that we may dow safely take aotion fortwo reasons: (l) that by meeting the Belgian Government - inrespeot of this guarantee we incur no fresh responsibility,and (2) that the Dutch and Belgian Governments have now comato terms over the new Treaty between them, of which the renewalof the former guarantee by Great Britain and France is anessential condition.C.P.I17. As I explained in my Memorandum of November lOtft   theBelgians have asked the British and French Governments to con-tinue the guarantee, created by the Treaty of l$39, tvom thetime of the signature of the new Treaty which will abrogate the1039 Treaty until such time, as the League of Nations shall haveprovided fresh guarantees; and M. Hyroans has. now definitelystated that he will not agree tn the signature of the new Treatyuntil he knows,that 3Uch an interim guarantee Will he given.From the point of view of Belgium his attitude isentirely justifiable, owing to the doubt as to the futureexistence or intentions of the League of Nations. On the otherhand from our point of view nothing is to &quot;bo gained &quot;by refusal ,sinoe if no jh^w Treaty is signed to abrogate the 1&amp;39 Treaty,the latter remains in force, and the French and ourselvoswill still bo/
been neldj and is supported &quot;by aikppini^xrf-tOio-Tiaw officers-Jiarfisr ba^-a&amp;XWW    If-therefore we agree to tlic abrogationof the 1839 Treaty and at the samo timo continue,.our guarantoe,we incur no fresh responsibility,   legally it may perhaps boSaid that a *new* .responsibility ts &quot;created in so far as ourguarantoo under tho 1839 Treaty was condition; 1.. on.the perpetualneutrality of Belgiumj and this will now disappear with theabrogation of the 1839 Treaty.   Accordingly -our guarantee willnot carry with. it -any &quot;c^rrespoind i n^-obliga4;iP.Tr, on the part ofBelgium,At tho same time 1 do not think that this legal point shouldbe unduly pressed, since it is clear that the guarantee must becontinued in some form, and. indeed under the 1839 Treaty is un-limited in time, whereas if we agree to the Belgian request now,our obligation will only continue until the league of Nationsshall have provided new guarantees, when we shall have no- furtherdirect responsibility other than what may be imposed on us as amember of the toague of Nations.   If on tho other hand we nowrefuse, wo shall, I fear,, give lasting offence to the Belgians..It is also, I TG^nitit, impossible for us to delay our daci^ion^until we know the fato of the Treaty of Versailles and of thoTripartite Treaty in America,   The latter may be a matter ofmdnths4 and meanwhile the Dutohr-Belgian negotiations which hareencountered great difficulty would infallibly break down,   Ishould not like to be held responsible for their failure.Sir B*. Crowe, who strongly advocates the decision which Irecommend, originally proposed that the new guarantee should take4**H fa
the form of a separate Treaty to &quot;be signed at the sametime as the Treaty abrogating the 1G59 Treaty. He nowproposes that the stipulation should be embodied in anarticle in the Treaty itself. The formula vhich he suggestsfor -this purpese in his telegram No. 1617 - of which accpy is annexed - would I think meet the wishes of theBelgian Government,I recommend therefore that we agree to the continuanceof the guarantee, subject to a time limit of a short- termof years.(Intd. )   C. of K-.Ftreign Office S,W,1.&quot;De? c ember 1st. 1919 e
Your, telegram 1398. .  -M. Orts second Belgian Delegate who has returned te Parishas f? sent me) a message to say his Government can come to nsdecision as to proposed treaty until they know attitude of- HisMajestyTs Government on question of continuing in some form orother guarantee of Belgian inviolability.It is desirable to avoid, if possible giving Belgians crDutch any excuse to say failure to arrive at agreement as torevision of 1939 Treaties is due to His Majesty&apos;s Government :and if we undertook to continue with France for a strictlylimited period guarantee cf 1839, it might now be as well,- inorder to mark fact that old guarantee was only being prolongedand that no new obligation was being undertaken, to emboiystipulation in an article in Treaty itself and not to make ofit a separate, Treaty- as suggested in my telegram 1495.Article might run as follows:-&quot;Until a decision has been come to .by League of Nationsin accordance with terms of Article I but not in anyevent for a longer period than five years from ratificationof present Treaty, Great Britain.and Prance agree tomaintain guarantee given to. Belgium by Treaties of.April19, 1839, in so far as that guarantee concernsindependence of Belgium and integrity of inviolabilityOf her territory&quot;.Mr.. Tufton has 3een both.
