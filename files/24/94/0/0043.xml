[This Dooum&amp;ic is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]/. //(/ &apos;:&apos;v     v /CONFIDENTIAL. Political Intelligence Department,Foreign Office.Denmark/008.(11456.)MEMORANDUMonTHE SLESVIG PLEBISCITE.V7 THE International Commission appointed to conduct the plebiscite in the twozones of Slesvig has carried out its preparatory work, and it is of interest to review thecircumstances under which the task has been accomplished. Working without precedents, and under the handicap of a delay in the formal ratification of the Treaty; it has had tocope with difficulties that under happier circumstances might never have arisen.The personnel of the Commission is incomplete owing to the attitude of the UnitedStates, which precluded the co-operation of the delegate of that country; butfortunately, the inclusion of an administrator of experience, in the person of M. de Sydow(Swedish delegate), has lightened a task of no little delicacy. The aim of the Commis-sion has been to interfere as little as possible with the normal rythm of life in the zonesduring their administration; and the series of regulations and administrative directions,chiefly the adaptations of M. de Sydow from drafts supplied by the former Chairman ofthe Committee of the North Slesvig Electors&apos; Union, are simple and clear, and promiseto work smoothly.Personnel.A word may be said about the Commissioners. Sir Charles Marling, the BritishMinister at Copenhagen, was appointed British Commissioner, and became Chairman.M. Claudel, the French Minister at Copenhagen, was appointed French Commissioner;the Swedish Government appointed M. de Sydow, the former Governor of the provinceof Gothenburg; - and the Norwegian Government M. Heftye, the Director of theTelegraph Administration. General Sladen was designated by the United States ofAmerica, but was not able to join the Commission for reasons already given.The discussions of the Commission were conducted in French, with occasionallapses into English or Danish, but the minutes were kept in English, while the regula-tions for the plebiscite have been drawn up in German and Danish. It was foundnecessary to have some immediate contact with the German authorities, andM. Boehme, Landrath of Tondern, was appointed by the German Legation in Copen-hagen, to act in this capacity.Propaganda.Both the Danes and Germans at once set about preparing the ground for adecision in their favour, hut it is obvious that the Germans entered on such a contestin a more favourable position ; and there is evidence of direct governmental action ontheir side. In passing, it may be noticed that in areas where a plebiscite is to betaken, the possessor, however bad his title may be, stands in a privileged position inthis respect. Representatives of his Government may visit the district; and whena small nation such as Denmark is involved, even permissible agitation on the part ofits sympathisers may be inhibited by fear.In the Flensborg district a newspaper was started, in Danish, by the Germans tofurther their cause, and during October numerous notices were posted up in Flensborg,which not always bowed to the jurisdiction of truth and accuracy. One of these borein large letters the word &quot; Tax-Plundering,&quot; and after giving instances of the oneroustaxation of Denmark, ended with the words : &quot; Choose ! If you vote for Denmarkyou will also have to bleed in the same way.&quot; Another poster stated that &quot; it isforbidden to speak German in Denmark;&quot; and recounted a story of a Germari whohad spoken to a German girl in a hotel and had been forbidden. Pamphlets weregfl   published giving quotations from the Danish press showing the feeble state of Danish
