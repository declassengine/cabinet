[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]CONFIDENTIAL.(11480.)I f-&apos; y    Political Intelligence Department.fc CP. ^^ Lfc/ALL&quot;^&quot;.ir-:r-:7-:Foreign Office.Scandinavia /o02.THE MOVEMENT TOWARDS DISARMAMENT IN SCANDINAVIA,FINLAND, AND HOLLAND.THERE can be no doubt tbat a strong tide has set in favour of reduction ofarmaments in Scandinavia* and Holland. The movement is clearly discernible evenwhere no action has been taken to modify the existing military system ; and it isstriking that the first attempts to make policy agree with national feeling have beenmade in the country where, on many grounds, a reduction of armaments was least to beexpected, i.e., Sweden. It is also of interest that the movement seems to have nodirect connection with a labour or &quot;left&quot; agitation, and is not wholly to be explainedby an objection to the expense entailed in supporting great armaments. Partly, itseems to be due to a natural recoil from the horror of war, and a conviction as to itsfolly; partly, too, to the feeling that. the League of Nations will render burdensomearmaments unnecessary. But the eagerness with which the latter idea has beenwelcomed suggests that the movement is not directly attributable to the foundation ofthe League.Sweden. In Sweden the movement has been most marked. On the 5th Junethree Bills were introduced by the Government providing for reductions in the period ofmilitary training. The most important aimed at reducing the period for the 1919 classof infantry from eight months to four months. This Bill was rejected by the FirstChamber, and amendments were added to the other two. But on the 27th Septembera Billf precisely similar to that which was rejected outright, was passed by bothChambers. About this time the number of vacancies in the Swedish Professional(Voluntarer) Army amounted to 6,428, out of a total establishment of 12,932 men. In thenavy the number of vacancies was 1,712. There are few enlistments, and the difficultyof maintaining the cadres of officers and non-commissioned officers has become serious.For it is to the Voluntarer that the nation looks for the supply of non-commissionedofficers; and the same troops maintain garrison service. In a peace establishment of2,654 officers (in 1917) there were recently 314 vacancies, and the militarist &quot; Stockholm&apos;sTidning&quot; refers to this, with a touch of exaggeration, as an &quot;automatic disarmament.&quot;The successive reductions in the period of military training, the great shrinkage in theprofessional army, and the widespread desire to diminish armaments led the Governmentto appoint, on the 12th November, a Commission to revise the country&apos;s scheme ofdefence. The Commission consists of four members each of the Liberal, SocialDemocratic, and Conservative Parties, with one representative each of. the LeftSocialists and the Peasant Party; and its appointment suggests that the Governmentare driven to recognise the inevitable and to attempt to regularise a disarmament whichthey cannot prevent.It is all the more remarkable that such a moment should take place in Sweden, inview of the fact that the Swedish General Staff have published their opinion that thenation&apos;s duties, so far as regards the armed forces of the kingdom, will be increased bythe League of Nations. Hitherto, it is contended, the military forces had but to defendtheir own territory, whereas adherence to the League would enlarge their rdle.M. Eden, the Premier, commenting upon the revision of the military system, stated   that&quot; the great question of the burdens of defence the chief point in the revision of thedefence scheme has now become- international in connection with the League ofNations.&quot; &apos; The tendency of. this statement conflicts directly with that of the GeneralStaff, and it is clearly more popular.Denmark and Norway. In Denmark and Norway the same movement is evident,though no such significant action has taken place. In the former country a commissionhas been discussing the Copenhagen defences for some months. The Lutkens disclosures* Information that has been received shows that Finland is to be included among the countries wherethis movement has made way.   a drastic reduction in the Finnish army is foreshadowedt Period reduced from 250 days to 120 days.j Speech at Gothenburg, the 9th November, 1919.   (Quoted from &quot; Tidens Tegn.&quot;)
were a by-product of these discussions, and when the matter was raised once again,the other day, M. Christensen, after replying to certain criticisms of his conduct, endedwith the statement that &quot; Article 8 in the League of Nations does not only speak of amaximum military expenditure, but it demands the retrenchment of armaments. Hereat home we all desire that, and we can begin by abolishing Copenhagen&apos;s land defences,even though, according to law, they need not be abolished until 1922.&quot; A few days-later the War Minister, also speaking in the Folketing, said &quot; We must not only doaway with the fortifications of Copenhagen, but also with conscription, without replacing&apos; conscription by an army of mercenaries, if we want to live up to the spirit and principlesof the League of Nations.....Let us lead the way and set a good example toothers.&quot;In Norway the movement is also evident, and there has been more agitation fromthe Extreme Left with regard to disarmament.Netherlands. - The Dutch army has been demobilised, and the numerical strengthof the army is practically that of 1914. The surplus of trained men will graduallydisappear, and plans are mooted by the Minister of War which will secure as efficient adefence with a smaller expenditure.^ This statement shows a profound realisation of themood that holds many nations. This is compounded, on the one side, of a latent fearof too great a disarmament, and, on the other, of an intense irritation with the burdensinvolved by the maintenance of armaments. The subject has been widely discussed inthe Chamber and in the press, and the &quot; Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant &quot; sums up theposition in an article pointing out that, in spite of the &quot; strong desire &quot; widely expressedfor a change in the military system, caution is necessary, in view of Hollands- geographical position. A &quot;considerable weakening&quot; of her forces might be regardedby foreign countries as a danger to their own safety. For these reasons, it is impossibleto reduce the forces &quot; considerably &quot; at present. But the Government consider thatwithout delay they should take the necessary measures to reduce the personal and financialburden. In view of the attitude of &quot; isolation&quot; which characterises the present Dutchforeign policy, it is significant that the Government are attempting to follow the courseupon which the Scandinavian nations have embarked the cutting down of armaments,so far as safety will.permit.December 3, 1919.* Prime Ministers statement in Chamber, the 21st November, 1919. The suggestion is to shorteninfantry training from eight and a half to six months, and cavalry training from twenty-four to eighteenmonths. Eepetitional training will also be shortened. Regimental cadres will be reduced as a result ofthese changes.
