op. ziy)k..      Adocument is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.THE CABINET.GERMAN PROGRAMME OF EXPLOITATION IN SIBERIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate a note by Professor Sir Bernard Pares on &quot; Der Aufmarsch im Osten:Russisches Asien als Ziel der friedens-ekonomischen Politik Deutschlands.&quot; (WernerDaya, Munich, 1917.) (&quot;The Advance in the East: Russian Asia as the Objective ofGermany&apos;s Peace Economic Policy.&quot;)WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.1st December, 1919.This work is in the main a thorough-going and well-written description of the    0149resources of Siberia, with maps.   The following extracts are taken from the first and    8516last chapters two well-written and well-reasoned essays, in which the writer gives hisgeneral conclusions.After the Armistice, when the west was definitely closed to German ambitions,such a programme became more necessary than ever to Germany, and references in thepress show that it is exciting increased interest tnere, in particular in connection withthe organization known as Schwere Industrien. That work is still being prosecutedwith this object I became aware on the evidence of the principal officials of SiberianCo-operation when in Siberia. It is through the co-operation movement, whichembraces 10,000,000 out of the 21,000,000 of population in Siberia, that such aprogramme can best hope to succeed.The cover of the book bears a map of Europe and Asia with arrows issuing fromBerlin, passing through Moscow, and diverging eastwards to Pekin and south-eastwardsto Turkestan.Extracts.&quot; In the first place, thanks to the inaccessible character of autocratic Russia,Germany was in the past cut off as by an impassable sea from the east of Europe,and sti llmore from the Asiatic continent which adjoins it.&quot;&quot;Germany is before all things a land power, and as a land power she mustbefore all things adopt an intensive continental policy.&quot;&quot; The world war seems in the end to be nothing else but a measuring ofstrength between the two most progressive States of Europe, England andGermany.&quot;&quot; Some strange and literally magic misunderstanding of our political positioninduced us in the past to direct all German efforts of expansion to or through theWest.   The Atlantic Ocean was literally on our brain.&quot;&quot;We must not split up our forces over the whole world. . In order to winback our political and economic position, what we have to do is only to work tocounteract this pressure (of England) and only to keep before our eyes the oneclear object Great Britain&apos;s position in the world and our own and to go forwardon that.&quot;&quot; Germany has to win on the eastern routes such a position as Great Britainhas on the western.&quot;&quot; Germany can conduct on two fronts a limited war, but she cannot conducton two fronts an unlimited economic peace campaign.&quot;The writer then proceeds to speak of trade relations between Germany and Russiain the past, and proceeds :-^&quot; But Germany and Russia require more. In the present political andeconomic position trade treaties are not enough. The time has come to broadenthem into an economic treaty.&quot;
&quot;Without Foreign help of a very wide and penetrating character, Russiacannot proceed to the reconstruction of her devastated state of economichusbandry.&apos;&apos;&quot;From Great Britain and from the United States she might have receivedthis help if the ship of that friendship had not been wrecked by the revolution.&quot;&quot; In general terms let us. suppose as follows : Let us somehow get to practicalresults by means of some kind of figure estimate of the respective militarypositions of Germany and Russia, and this estimate will become a kind of passivedebt capital of the Russian, State, which it will later pay and liquidate by meansof our enjoyment of economic rights over Russian Asia.&quot;&quot; Let there be made in Germany a consortium of the chief banks, commercial,industrial and steamship corporations with representatives of the Government,perhaps under the lead of the Imperial Bank, and let this consortium be a kind oforgan of administration of the Bussian Treaty debt, and to it should be entrustedthe organization and exploitation of the acquired rights and the systematicexploitation of the various lands.&quot;&quot;&apos; Inexperienced and industrious Siberia will become a second North America.&quot;&quot;The potential future of Siberia is always a thousand times more real andmore realizable than anything in the present of European Russia.&quot;&quot;Whether in the distant future we may expect from our political andeconomic activity in Russian Asia, nearer treaty relations in Russia is not a matteron which we need to think. It is not for RussiVs sake that Germany must enteron the road which leads her through Asia, but for the realization of the greatobject of her own continental policy. The war has given us the proof that on thisthe Germany overseas policy, which found its previous expression in colonialpossessions, hangs in the main as long as Germany is not in a position to approachthe English possessions by land ; as long as the English possessions, separated fromus as by an impassable precipice, cannot be attacked by us, so long can Englandon her side count on the possibility of victory, because she can cut Germany offfrom overseas trade with the world, and from the import of raw materials and theexport of her products.&quot;&quot; If we broaden out the circuit of our economic activity so as to bring-all A sia into close relations with us, we shall then make it possible in a future warto plunge down on India aiid hurl the British rule from the continent into the sea,as also we shall be sure of making ourselves independent of the sea and of theimport of raw materials; and with this all prospect of victory henceforward forGreat Britain falls to the ground.&quot;&quot; And let it once more be pointed out that this continental advance bringsGermany and Japan so much closer together that they, in alliance with Russia,would embrace the old world as with an iron grip which no power can breakthrough and from whose hard surface all attempts at attack will fall harmless.&quot;&quot; Germany, Japan with Russia that is the most natural political constel-lation which can be formed out of the inter-relation of the interests of- the world.Germany and Japan with Russia, that is exactly the alliance of the TwentiethCentury.&quot;&quot; Thus, for Germany the road eastwards means the unassailable freedom ofthe road westward. Our economic political establishment on the Eurasiancontinent means the securing of our position overseas the intelligent execution ofour continental policy means the building up again of our colonial policy.&quot;Apart from the reasonableness of this book, certainly much more sensible thanBernhardi, and apart from the obvious emphasis which this idea must receive from theTreaty of Versailles, I found on my arrival in Siberia that this idea was everywhere inthe atmosphere. In Vladivostock, General Ivanov-Rinov, one of the chief internaladversaries of Admiral Koltchak and the leader of the Japanese party, said to me thathe looked to Germany and Japan as the future allies of Russia, adding no doubt byway of courtesy &quot; and England.&quot; He also told me thait he had already made hisarrangements with the Japanese. This frankness was in no way due to any failing onmy part to make my own views quite clear to him.
In Harbin, General Gondati, the one experienced statesman whom I met in Siberia(formerly acting general of the Pri-Amur Province) told me that this view was every-where to be found there.In Omsk, Admiral Koltchak, whom I knew previously, began by saying that thisview was all round him, that if it triumphed he would no longer remain in power butthat he feared that its strength was growing. In his last talk with me he expressedthe fear that Russia and Germany should both find themselves among the discontentednations and, therefore, gravitate together.The Omsk Cadets, who are entirely pro-English, thought it necessary to debatethe idea at their yearly conference in order to express their disapproval of it, and theirleader, an old personal friend and a confirmed Anglophile, asked specially for a privatetalk with me in order to say how grave he thought this danger was becoming.In the front zone where I stayed for two months I found only one motivedominating all political tendencies, &quot;namely, the question, to whom should Russia turnfor any help to re-establish the state of normal life overthrown by the Bolsheviks, andthis feeling was common to all classes.Not only Admiral Koltchak but all the members of his Cabinet except GeneralLebedev (the culprit of all the military reverses of last July) were absolutely opposedto the pro-German view. I was myself convinced that all danger both of reaction andof a pro-German Russia came from the reactionary section of officers and officials andit was, therefore, in the highest degree to our interest, in order to avert both theseclangers, to take a strong hand in supporting the existing government against it. I hadmany proofs that this line, where taken by the English, was enough to secure us thatdirection of Russian affairs necessary for the carrying through of the Avishes of theAllies.
