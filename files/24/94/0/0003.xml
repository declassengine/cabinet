This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.THE CABINET.DISPOSAL OF CAPTURED BRITISH WAR MATERIALIN GERMANY.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate, for the consideration of my colleagues, a memorandum by the General.Staff. -WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.25th November, 1919.1. Under Article 169 of the Treaty of Peace with Germany (see Appendix I.),  ^i.within two months of the coming into force of the Treaty, Germany is required to      ^deliver to the principal Allied and Associated Powers, arms and war material of originother than German.2. The question arises as to the disposal of this material after its surrender by theGermans.3. The material will consist principally of guns, machine guns and rifles taken fromthe Allies on the field of battle. From the British point of view and for the followingreasons, the most desirable course to adopt would be to demand the surrender of thismaterial only for the purpose of destruction : (a.) A long time must elapse before transport can be provided to convey thematerial to England. Large quantities of war material remain to be dealtwith in the British occupied area of Germany, and in France and Belgium.(&amp;.&apos;) We do not require more guns of any type captured from us.(c.) It is unlikely that any of the material will be found to be in a serviceablecondition.(d.) It will add to the prestige of the Allied Powers not to insist on the surrender-ing of material captured on the field of battle, but merely to demand itsdestruction.(e.) The expense involved in transporting the material to England would beconsiderable.4. It would appear, therefore, that the material of non-German origin should bedestroyed in Germany, and that attempts should be made to sell to the Germans theraw material, of which they are much in need.5. General Nollet, the French President of the Military Inter-Allied Commissionof Control, and Major-General Hon. Sir F. R. Bingham, senior British Representative onthe Commission, and President of the Sub-Commission for Arms and Material, are bothin agreement that the above procedure is the best and most desirable.6. As the Allies generally are concerned in this matter, the final decison should begiven by the Supreme War Council in Paris. The British Military Representative onthe Council wishes to be informed of the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government on thesubject before submitting it for decision by the Allies (see Appendix II.).(B19/543)  90  11/10  H&amp;S  773 lwo
APPENDIX II.The Minister,You will remember a conversation I had with you before leaving for Germany onthe question of the material of non-German origin which is to be surrendered to the Alliesunder Article 169 of the Treaty of Peace. I am of the opinion-and General Nollet,President of the Military Commission, agrees with me that we should only demandthe surrender of this material for the purpose of destruction, instead of taking it backin the occupied territory.   The following are my reasons :-(1.) The material, which will consist principally of guns, machine guns and rifles,was taken from us on the field of battle, and I cannot imagine that, as amatter of prestige, any nation would care to have its material returned toit unless recaptured on the field of battle.(2.) It will be a great inconvenience to find transport in Germany to remove it.(3,) It will seriously inconvenience the representative of the Ministry of Munitionsof the Army of the Ehine, who has already very large quantities of materialto deal with.(4.) It will add to the prestige of the Allied nations not to insist on this renderingof material, showing them we are not here to humiliate, but to carry outdisarmament.(5.) It is most unlikely that any of the material is at present in a serviceablecondition.We should, of course, insist on the whole of it being destroyed and will attempt tosell the raw material, of which the Germans are very much in need, to their authorities.To do this, if you and the Army Council agree to the above principle, I shall ask youto be so kind as to send me a representative for the purpose of carrying out thefinancial transaction when I require him. General Nollet, President of the Military(Commission, is equally referring the matter to his own Government, stronglyadvocating the above procedure, and I hope that you will agree with me that it is theproper one.I am sending a copy of this letter to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff forhis approval, as it is one of the Clauses of the Treaty of Peace, and he was the BritishMilitary Representative on the Peace Council.It would be even more magnanimous to let them have the raw material as theamount will be trivial and will take a let of collecting, but this is, of course, for you todecide.(Signed)   F. R, BINGHAM, Major-General,President of the Sub-Commissionfor Armaments and MaterialExtract from the Treaty of Peace between the Allied and AssociatedPowers and Germany.Article 169.Within two months of the coming into force of the present Treaty, German arms,munitions and war material, including anti-aircraft material, existing in Germany inexcess of the quantities allowed, must be surrendered to the Governments of thePrincipal and Allied Associated Powers to be destroyed or rendered useless. This willalso apply to any special plant intended for the manufacture of military material, exceptsuch as may be recognized as necessary for equipping the authorized strength of theGerman Army.The surrender in question will be effected at such points in German territory as maybe selected by the said GovernmentsWithin the same period, arms, munitions and war material, including anti-aircraftmaterial, of origin other than German, in whatever state they may be, will be deliveredto the said Governments, who will decide as to their disposal.Anns and munitions which on account of the successive reductions in the strengthof the German Army become in excess of the amounts authorized by Tables II. and III.annexed to this Section must be handed over in the manner laid down above withinsuch periods as may be decided by the Conferences referred to in Article 163.
