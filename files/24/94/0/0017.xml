3/^o     ,   \^TlTiN 03? 10fl-BEEAK3E3 &amp; SEALING STEAMERS TO EiJSBU,&apos;--2aLi:S^       Memorandum for the Cabinet by the .First lordof the Admiralty.With reference to the memorandum by the Ministryof Shipping [C.P-..183&apos;) on the subject of the return ofcertain ice-breakers and sealing steamers to the Northernprovisional Government of Russia, there is, from the navalpoint of view, no objection to the immediate surrender ofall the ice-breakers, with the exception of the&quot;Sviatogor&quot; and &quot;Alexander&quot;; indeed&quot;, it is considereddesirable to give them up as soon as possible.    They areof no commercial value, so far as can be seen, to anyonebut the Russians,it is, however, imperative   that the &quot;Sviatogor&quot;and &quot;Alexander&quot; should be retained until the Britishnaval forces are clear of the Baltic.     A ship may geticed in, or it may be necessary to send a ship to someport where the ice must be broken.       The present ordersare for the &quot;Sviatogor&quot; to remain in commission, and the&quot;Alexander&quot; to reduce to care and maintenance party,ready for sea at seven days1 notice.As an alternative to the return of the remainingfive to the North Russian Government, I should like topoint out that the town of Riga has been insistent in herdemands for an ice-breaker - and these have been backedby Colonel Tallents and the British Mission there.If one of the ice-breakers could, withoutraising embarrassing questions of ownershipt be turnedover to the l&amp;tvian government for use at Riga, it would,,1 think, tend to popularise the British Government, andmight subsequently be useful as a trade lever.    It;would, however, be impossible for the British Navy toprovide a crew for the ship.The Admiralty is not concerned in the disposalof the four sealing steamers.(Intlld.)       W.H.L.87. 11. 19.)
