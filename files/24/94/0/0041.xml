CHURCHILL.1st December, 1919.1. When attempting to unravel the tangle of affairs in Russia and the Baltic .States, it is most difficult to formulate- any plan of action which, on the one hand- iswithin the wishes, or even within the powers, of the Allies to carry out, and, on theother hand, is likely to offer even reasonable prospects of-success.2. The situation itself is so complicated and is changing so constantly by the actionof ephemeral leaders or agents, who enjoy only a momentary power, but who neverthelessare listened to and leave their mark for good or ill behind them, that it is almostimpossible to depict in any coherent and conclusive manner the true state of affairs.3. There are, however, a few salient facts which every investigation leads up to,and which must eventually bear the most important part in the solution of the problem.Of these facts, the one that stands out most prominently is the influence of Germany.She is determined, and has always been determined since the day of the RussianRevolution, to become the master of that country, including the Baltic States. It ishere that she anticipates the military, economic and financial resurrection of her over-populated Fatherland. She has left, and will leave, no stone unturned to gain theseends. She has been beaten on her Western front, but she has never been beaten onher Eastern front. The half-formed and unstable governments of Russia, Poland, theUkraine, the Baltic States and Finland, have felt the military power of Germany, buthave only seen the limited moral power of the Allied Missions, which have never beenbacked by sufficient military force to produce decisive, results. Germany is fermenting,in every possible way, the unrest and disturbances which are existing in thesecountries. She wishes them to remain for the present in a state of confusion, so thatlater, when peace is signed, and she becomes free of the shackles of the Armistice andof the dictation of the Allies, she may herself commence the domination she is workingfor.4. The second important factor is the extremely limited military, economic andfinancial power of every one of the States on the eastern borders of Germany. Thereis not one of them which is able to dominate another; there is not one of them whichis sufficiently powerful to attract to itself definitely and firmly any other, so as toincrease its own power, whilst there is not one of them that has not territorial or otherdesigns upon its neighbour. Finland wants part of Russia, Esthonia - wants part ofLatvia, the Poles want part of. Lithuania, and no doubt if Lettland and Lithuania werenot in the grip of German agents and their auxiliaries and are consequently inarticulate,they would also have equally grasping aims. Russia, from my personnel contact withRussians on the north-west front, appears to be in even a worse state. She is dividedinto two parties; one, the mass of whom are desirous of an extremely democratic butnevertheless orderly government, but who are led by a small body of communists of theworst type; the other a small part of whom are half-hearted democrats, and themajority, including the leaders, extreme reactionaries, who wish to return to theautocratic government of former times with all its abuses, and have every intention ofestablishing such a government if they succeed in overcoming, their opponents.Information I have received from Russians and others leads me to believe that theabove applies, to a considerable extent, to other parts of the Russian theatre of war,01498513
but I am unable to state thus from personal observation. Germany has her agents inevery one of these countries, and in every one of the contending parties in each, and isdoing her utmost by means of these agents to postpone the formation of any powerfuland orderly government on her eastern frontiers. She knows perfectly well that if-shecan only keep these States separated by nursing their conflicting interests, she willhave an easy task later on.to work out her own designs in spite of the Allies or of theLeague of Nations.5. The third important factor in the situation is the disinclination and possiblythe incapacity of the Allies to exercise sufficient power in these countries to createorder out of chaos. The various British Missions that have been sent to all theseStates, except to Soviet Russia, have produced a good effect. It is a significant fact,however, that this effect has been by far the greatest where military action has beenin progress, and where the British military and political missions, backed by the Britishfleet, have had a very considerable voice in the actual operations of the troops, who arefighting. The action of these missions, however, is not sufficiently powerful to producedefinite results. They can only help to sway events Or postpone disaster, and they areweakened by the sinister hand of the German working in every one of these countries,including those of the Allies.6. The only method of commencing the work of stabilizing the Baltic States andRussia is to crush the activities of the Germans, show these States that the Allies havethe power as well as the will to enforce their desires, and then everything will be easy.7. Germany cannot he crushed in her activities by military or political missions ;she is simply laughing at them. She can, however, be crushed with comparative easeand without large expenditure by an Allied occupation of the Baltic States. Thisoccupation must involve the departure of every German born individual, whethersoldier or civilian, from the Baltic States and Finland. The Finns, Esthonians, Letts,Lithuanians, Poles and, if necessary, the Czecho-Slovaks, must be made to understandthe weight of the Allied hand and that it is heavier than the mailed fist of Germany.They must be told not to interfere with each other, not to try and grasp each othersterritory, and that their future will be decided upon according to the way in whichthey behave towards the Allies, and the assistance they give in helping the Allies tocreate free and contented peoples in Eastern Europe. They must not be bargainedwith and no promises must be made. The Allies are themselves going to take thematter in hand; they are going, to treat each one of them fairly and they must becontent for the moment to hold themselves in subordination.8. Two divisions or their equivalent, landed in Libau and Memel with the intentionfirst of drawing a cordon between East Prussia and Lithuania, will probably go fartowards settling the matter without a shot being fired, but the actual military forcemust be there. It is not sufficient, however, to land at Libau and Memel only. TheFinns and the Esthonians must be directed to facilitate the landing of Allied troops intheir own harbours, even if such landings are only intended as a mask. The wholemust be under the direction, of one British commander, and the Governments of Finlandand the Baltic States must be given to understand that though there is no intention ofthe British commander exercising authority over their governments or their troops, hehas absolute control of all military operations, and will at once command any troopswhich may become engaged against an opponent in these regions. He will also begiven the use of such roads, railways, bases, &amp;c, as he may require for his operations.R. HAKING, Lieut-General,Commanding British Missions to Baltic States.H.M.S. &quot;Galatea,&quot;1,7th November, 1919.
-with special cards, and are to retrain scrupulously from political agitation or conduct-likely to trouble public tranquillity. Technical,counsellors have been appointed for theadministration of the voting area from local residents, lawyers, editors, and localadministrators.The Time Table.According to the Treaty the evacuation was to take place in 10 days, the vote inthe first zone in the next 21 days, and the vote in the second zone in the next 35 days,making 66 days in all. After a conversation with the G-erman delegate the Commissionadopted the following programme for the change of administration : The Germanofficials are to remain in the district for the first five of the 10 days allowed bythe Treaty, and the Commission will send its personnel and special officials duringthese 5 days to Flensborg, and preparations will be made to take over on the sixthday. Evacuation of the military and naval authorities, it is hoped, will be arrangedin the same period by the Supreme Council. The Commissioners will arrive after thetroops; and the military barracks, Hotel Mensburger Hof, and Jernbal Hotel havebeen selected for the accommodation of the personnel of the new administration. TheCommission hope to shorten by a fortnight the 5 weeks allowed by the Treaty fortaking the vote in the second zone. About a week will be necessary to prepare thereport and send it to Paris. On the reckoning of the Treaty the Commission shouldhave finished its work in 73 days, but on the time-table drawn up by the Commissionthe work should be complete in 59 days.It is expected that there will be 140,000 voters in both zones, and it is interestingto note that of this number some 30,000 will probably come from Denmark andGermany. Some careful scrutiny of claims will be necessary ; but the Commission has-already secured the advice of competent experts, and it seems probable that the workwill be carried out efficiently and without friction.November 26,1919.o
parties were allowed, but numbers of Danes visited the ships.   Sir Charles Marlingstates that no evidence of intimidation was brought to the notice of the captain, andM. Claudefs assertion that the Channel buoys had been moved at one place is sufn-ciently explained by Commander Brisson&apos;s admission that his maps were faulty and.v    out of date.   On each side elaborate arrangements have been made to convey theW   voters to their native land, and there seems every intention that the lame, the halt, andthe blind shall not suffer any disability in recording their vote.   The &quot; Committee forthe Indivisibility of Slesvig-Holstein &quot; has arranged special trains for the conveyance ofvoters from Germany, and although the ordinary trains are unheated, these are to beheated, and the voters are to travel&apos;second class.   Hr. Hansen N0rrem0ller announced,from the Danish side, that voters would be conveyed free, would receive free board andlodging, and&apos; that special arrangements should be made for old and weakly people, evento the extent of providing a guide if necessary.   The railways, he said, can take 8,000to 9,000 a day, and boats would be provided for the accommodation of people from theislands.Official Preparation.In the midst of this disturbed atmosphere the Commission went its way quietly.A number of regulations and instructions have been drawn up to meet the necessarychanges of administration. The proclamation, on the assumption of administrativepowers by the Commission, is a short and clearly-worded document, stating that theCommission takes over the administration &quot; in virtue of Article 109 of the Treaty,signed on the 28th June, 1919, and ratified . . . .&quot; Legal administration is to proceedas formerly. Changes necessary to ensure proper administration, and to ensure theplebiscite &quot; under free and honourable conditions &quot; are to he published in the officialjournals and in the press, and posted up in public places. This proclamation is to besigned by the Commissioners. There are instructions drawn up for the postmaster ofthe Slesvig plebiscite at Flensborg, and stamps are to be supplied in proportion tothe average weekly consumption, a sufficient quantity of each denomination beingstruck in order to meet the demand of philatelists, &amp;c. A similar instruction constitutesa director of railways for the &quot; Slesvig Plebiscite,&quot; and in each case these chief officialsare to act as the intermediaries between the Administration and the correspondingofficials outside the plebiscite area. Stamps and orders are to bear the heading &quot; SlesvigPlebiscite &quot; ; all money payments are to be countersigned by the Commission and other-wise not to be accepted for payment at any office or bank. A circular has been drawnup for the information of the general administrative authorities, and a resolution as tothe formation of a committee to control the food supply. This committee, with anexecutive of two sitting in Flensborg, is to deal with the supply of coal, food, andbuilding materials to the plebiscite area and the delivery of cattle and produce toGermany. An arrangement is to be made that, in return for a supply of coal andbuilding material,^ the Commission will allow the weekly export of 390 head of cattleand 36,000 lb. of butter. For a smaller quantity of coal, cattle and butter are tobe exported pro ratd. Questions of rationing which cannot be decided by the localorganisation are to come before them for solution, and they are to deal with full power,their expenses being defrayed by the International Commission.The gendarmerie is to be disbanded and a new force created, and this,.with thepolice, will be under the director appointed by the Commission. There are other enact-ments dealing with the evacuation of officials and Workers&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Councils, asprovided by the Treaty; for the retention of the mark as the ordinary monetaryunit; for the payment of officials chosen by the Commission, and for the retention ofarms by the customs guards. Officers, soldiers, and sailors coming from the outside areato vote must not wear uniform while in the area, and no one is to enter or leave thedistrict where voting is to take place, after the .Commission have taken over control,without a vised passport.The Commission decided that the correspondents allowed in the voting areaduring the plebiscite should be limited to fiftyt each for Germany and Denmark, and amaximum of twelve for any other country.   Such correspondents are to be provided* The amount to be settled later.f This mimber fifty seems to have been selected with reference to Germany.   It would have been fairerto have taken a number suggested by the smaller country, as it is obvious that Germany can easily select  ,50 efficient journalists, whereas it will not be possible for Denmark to choose so great a number.   Asjournalists are generally efficient propagandists, this is a matter of some importance ; and in other plebiscitesit might be well to consider this point.
finances. In these propaganda activities it is impossible to trace any governmentalinspiration, but the larger part of the agitation in Slesvig was directly carried out bythe Government. Dr. Koster, the German Minister, toured the provinces withrepresentatives of the &quot; Daily Chronicle,&quot; &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; and &quot; Manchester Guardian,&quot;and pointed out to them the German character of certain towns such as Tondern. InNovember Hr. Bauer, the Chancellor, and Hr. Heine, Minister of the Interior, visitedFlensborg together ; and the latter made a statement that the Government had granteda large sum of money &quot;to heal the wounds which the war had caused in that region.&quot;He further stated that the Prussian Government would &quot; assist all officials who hadsuffered pecuniary loss owing to the situation,&quot; and that Slesvig-Holstein (in commonwith all other provinces) &quot; would be granted a far-reaching autonomy.&quot;Hr. Bauer on this occasion gave an interview to &quot; Politiken,&quot; in which he statedthat there was no opposition among the bulk of Germans to the return of NorthSlesvig, but that Germans found it unfair that the whole of Tondern should be placedin the first zone, which is to vote en bloc. He therefore put forth the suggestion thatthe Danish and German Governments should come to an agreement between themselves,in which case he felt sure that Paris would agree to their wishes.The Gerruans had, of course, made preparations to see that everyone entitled tovote should be notified. There were notices posted up even in Wiirtemburg, andvoters were registered in various parts of the country. In Hamburg there were 12,000 ;and it is estimated that in Kiel there were 300. Even as early as the 12th July, thelists of soldiers entitled to vote had already been drawn up. These activities werequite unobjectionable, but the same cannot be said of other actions taken by theGerman Government. It seems certain that a considerable quantity of fertiliser wasremoved to Germany; and, at the instance of Hr. Hansen Norremoller, Hr. Boehmewas asked to see that this was stopped. There are a number of alleged cases ofsequestration of State properties. Thus a number of farmer tenants were granted theownership of the land they occupied, the aim being apparently to ensure that suchcentres should remain as the foci of German influence. The school of navigation atAabenraa and the gymnasia at Haderslev and Sonderburg were ceded by the PrussianGovernment to German syndicates for the same reason, and the naval establishments at -Sonderburg on the island of Als were sold at the beginning of June 1919 for7,000,000 M. to a German syndicate. These points were brought to the notice of theSupreme Council by the Danish Legation in Paris.There are other allegations of unfair dealing, but it is not always possible to sayhow trustworthy they are. The despatch of a battalion of German troops, in thelast week of October, to Flensborg was very strongly resented by the Danes, and itdoes not seem to have been necessary from the evidence of labour disturbances at ourdisposal. A deputation from Sonderburg to Copenhagen in July stated that the townwas terrorised by German sailors from Kiel, and that the German military and civilauthorities had refused to intervene. There are allegations of &quot; persecution &quot; of theMiddle Slesvigers who agitated for incorporation, and of the arrest of persons whoworked for the inclusion of the third zone. - Probably none of these allegations need betaken too seriously. But it is reported that the southern frontier of the second zonewas occupied by the military authorities in order to prevent the removal of cattle andcorn to North Slesvig and Denmark. An allegation which deserves a little more con-sicleration is that the Germans had attempted to replace anti-Germans in Slesvig bypro-Germans. The Supreme Council is stated to have drawn the attention of theGerman Government to this report; but it is difficult to see how it could have beentrue in the light of Baron Lersner&apos;s statement that natives of Slesvig could not beexpelled therefrom except when they were expelled from the country altogether.Among the Danes of Slesvig it was soon found necessary to close the ranks of partycleavage in order to present a united front againt the German propaganda, A Danishloan of 120,000,000 kroner was started on the 19th August to cover the expensesconnected with the return of Slesvig; and steps were taken to inform all voters of theoffice where they could register in Copenhagen. A party of Flensborg merchants,manufacturers, and manual workers visited Copenhagen, and left on the 31st October,,after seeing everything of interest. But little was or could be done from Denmark tointerest Slesvig voters in the Danish point of view. The Government was inundatedby complaints of terrorisation and victimisation; and, at the request of Hr. HansenN0rrem0ller, M. Claudel sent the &quot; Marseillaise &quot; to visit the ports in North Slesvig, inorder to reassure the inhabitants, although this was directly contrary to the wishes ofthe German Government. The &quot; Marsailleise&quot; visited Sonderburg, Aabenraa, andFlensborg, meeting everywhere with a rapturous reception from the Danes.   No landing
