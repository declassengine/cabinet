Ihe oampaignfor nationalisation continues, but Mr. Arnold Lupton, who wassentenced to imprisonment for pro-German activities during thewar, has come forward as a leoturer against nationalisation.    Itis too early yet to note the effect of the reduced price ofdomestic coal.ftie discontent at the high oost of living oannot beexaggerated.    Ihis and the housing difficulty are responsible formost of the unrest.   There appears to be a general feeling thatworking men would prefer a reduction in prioes to increasedwages.    Ihe foolish paragraphs in newspapers, reporting cases ofinflated profits and foolish extravaganoe, are doing untold harm.The spread of classes for teaching revolution deservesattention.    Some effort ought certainly to be made to counteractthem.    ftie olass at Bury includes members of the lower middleblase.Ihe movement for oo-ordinating the Co-operative Societiesand the Trades Unions for strike purposes continues.)

- 2 -The Labour Members of Borough Councils appear, on thewhole, to be moderate and sensible men.   They are anxious tohave salaries at the expense of the ratepayers. 9Every effort ia being made by extremists to fan classhatred, and it is a sinister phenomenon that the editorials-in two of the reports of important Unions reoite ola3Sgrievances to the exclusion of the affairs of the Unions.This may turn out to be a passing phenomenon, but/it isdisquieting. &apos; \iib no time in social history has the need for soundeconomic popular teaching been more evident.
TOIOltfolSATIOH OP TO,COAL MINES -The propaganda oampaign oontinues.   It is too earlyyet to say what effeot the re duo ti on in the price ofdomestio ooal will have upon the movement.    The war makesstrange bed-follows; Mr, Arnold Lupton, who sufferedimprisonment for his pre-Germah activities during the war,has now come forward as a leoturer against nationalisation;it is soaroely necessary to. add that he has interests inooal mines.Itiy correspondent in South Wales reports that thetradesmen and lower middle class are being oonverted tonationalisation.    In Staffordshire, Dr . Marion Phillipsis canvassing women voters in favour of nationalisation.GENERAL. STAFF FOii LABOUK.   -The sub-Committee which has been considering thisquestion has reported to the parliamentary Committee ofthe Trade Union Congress and has passed a resolution whiohwill be submitted to the special Trade Union Congress onDecember 9th and 10th.    The- resolution reoommends thatthe standing Order of;Congress be revised in order:1,   To substitute for the Parliamentary Committeea Trades Union Congress General Counoil, tobe eleoted annually by Congress,2.   To prepare a soheme. determining the compositionand methods of eleotion of the General Counoil.3,   To make arrangements for the development ofadministrative departments in the offioes of theGeneral Ccunoil, in the direction of securing tho- necessary offioials, exaff and equipment tosecure an effioient trade union oentre.There was an interesting disoussion at Chandos Hallon November 21st. .  Mr. Fred Bramley admitted the laok ofoo-ordination among the Trt-des Unions and proposed a sohemewith a central administration, a publioity staff, and alegal department housed in well equipped offices?, &quot;similarto/
to the Prudential Insuranoe buildings, Holbora&quot;,    Mr.G.H.D, Cole took the view that a oentral organisationwould lose touoh with the rank and file, who mightbreak away.    He favoured the idea of the One Big Union andwas against the Executive being invested with too muohpower, as it would inoline towards autooraoy.    He didnot explain how the One Big Union idea would get overthis difficulty. EVOLUTIONARY P 0?A3ANDA..The spread of olasses for teaohing revolutioncontinues.    Quite recently courses have been arranged inTottenham and Coventry and others are being formed inWest Cumberland.    The Bury branoh of the Plebs League hasorganised an Industrial History Class, of whioh J.T, WaltonNewbold is tutor; 82 students have been enrolled.    2heyare drawn from various olasses - draughtsmen, patternmakersironfounders, sheet metal workers , spinners, beamers,twisters and drawers, bleaohers and dyers, generalwarehousemen, shuttlemakers, bridelayers, doggers,tailors, paper workers, law clerks, a journalist, membersof the Amalgamated Sooiety. of Engineers, steam enginemakers, oo-operative employees, National union offtailwaymen, National Uhion of Clerks and National Unionof Teachers.    It is not suggested that these .olasses area serious menace to the-stability of sooiety at present,but they are certainly siSffioient reason for the ,.undertaking of. sound economic education.A fresh attempt is to be made to seoure the L.C.C.schools cn Sundays for the propagation of socialism.   Itwill/
will be moved at the next meeting of the EducationalCommittee that the present policy of refusing the use ofthe sohools for the teaching of political dootrinesshould be re-considered.In this connection, there is an illuminatingartiale in the current issue of the &quot;iJooialist&quot; entitled&quot;Educational Activities in South Wales&apos;&apos;&quot;The Sooial Soienoe Classes are now in full&quot;swing.   At Aberdare, *ibertillery and some parts&quot;of the .-hondda, the olasses are run by the miners&apos;wdistriots.   Throughout the whole ooalfield the&quot;ory is for more teachers, and some, if not all, of&quot;the districts are eagerly awaiting for the return&quot;of the present students in residence at the 0.1,0.&quot;Why not get the different districts to take over&quot;all olasses as their own, and make the running of&quot;olasses an integral part of their trade union work?&quot;That these olasses are to have a considerable&quot;effeot on the policy and object of our industrial&quot;organisations no one but an idiot or a politician&quot;con doubt.   Indeed, it will help us to measure the&quot;weakness of the working olass movement if we ask&quot;ourselves - What would have happened during the&quot;recent miners&apos; crisis and the railwaymen&apos;8 strike&quot;if these olasses had commenced their teaching&quot;about 25 years ago?  Would it have remained as a&quot;revolutionary situation merely, and an object&quot;lesson in industrial solidarity only, or would it&quot;have meant something very much nearer, to the&quot;heartfs desire?&quot;Classes should not be held for the sake of&quot;holding them, but for the permeation of our unions&quot;with revolutionary conceptions.&quot;If we hurry on our olass work, and carry our&quot;revolutionary teaching into our industrial&quot;organisations these; people will have to realise, if&quot;they are at all capable of realising sooial&quot;development, that in a short period of time .&quot;reactionary movements will be criminal and&quot;the revolutionary one will be the normal.Speaking .of the olasses reminds me that the&quot;eight students granted a two-years&apos; scholarship&quot;at the C.L.C. by the South Wales Miners&apos; 13.C, it&quot;has now been deoided to give these eight boys  52&quot;per year for book money.   The same applies to the&quot;students of those distriots who have sent their&quot;own students to the C.L.C.UIt has been suggested that the best means of ,oombating revolutionary teaching would be through theworkmen&apos;s/
. . workmen&apos;0 clubs.    The majority of workers do not attendbranch meetings or classes, but spend muoh of theirleisure in these olubs.    The work,would have to be doneby speakers , but in view of the comparative ineffectivenessof posters and leaflets the suggestion deservesconsideration.    Organisations, such as the NationalDemooratio Party, would be best fitted for this work, forworking men only would have acoess to these olubs and afair ohanoe of suooess.CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES AND THE THADE TOONS.The Co-operative Sooieties in Lanarkshire arereported to be laying in extra stooks of food.    Animportant conference was held reoently at Glasgow to- disoussthe help that might be given by the Co-operativeWholesale Sooiety to the banking of Trade Union funds.-It is reported that agencies of the Co-operativeWholesale Sooiety Bank have been given to 500 localCo-operative Sooieties.    Ohe number of Trade Unionaooounts has increased this year from 842 to 1,103, andtheir total deposit approaches two millions.    It is not- -at all certain that the great body of oo-operators wouldapprove of the extremist activities of their Committeeif ikey knew of them.    For example, the Co-operativeEducational Committee in Birmingham is issuing thefollowing pamphlets for local distribution:-&quot;Direot Aotion - Trade Unionists andCo-operators oombine to meet theCapitalist Menaoe.&quot;&quot;Co-operators and labour Unrest.&quot;&quot;Co-operators and tie construction.&quot;In/
- 5 - 39In the Newcastle area there seems to be a generalagreement that the oo-op era tors shap.1 give support to -theLabour Movement in kind, bat where thtf arrangement isimpossible, the Co-operative Bank is willing to givecredit to the extent of  2 per member of each Union forsupplies obtained from the looal Co-operative Stores.The Educational Committee of the Koyal ArsenalSoolety and the Woolwich Trades and labour Council areorganising a campaign for the week beginning December 8th,with the object of oementing the Labour and Co-operativeMovements *On the other hand, a oo-eperative offioial atManchester told one of my correspondents that there was notruth in the statement that they would assist the minersin a strike.    He said that they could net supply theminers with ooal because their stocks were so low that theyoould scarcely supply their registered customers.    Ifoeywere handicapped by lack of transport far more than othertrades who were hostile to them.In Bolton, where the private traders have lostcustomers among the moulders who are oh strike, the looaltraders have made overtures to the strikers to take foodfrom them on credit oh the same terms as those offered bythe Co-operative Society, but their overtures wererejected.My correspondent reports that the small tradesmenwould give the Government whole-hearted support in any fsteps it might take to counteract the manoeuvres of theTrades Unions and the   Co-operative Sooieties.    This sameoo*-operative/[
oo-operative offioial further stated that he had notioedan attitude of antagonism on the part of the Government,who had seoratly set wheels in motion to impede the progreof 1he movement,;      Practioally all my. correspondents report that the, feeling against profiteering has become far worse duringthe last four weeks, and,that the workers regard thelowering of prices as more important than an inorease inwages.    The importance of a reduotion in the oost ofliving oanno,t be exaggerated;   it would really be asolution of most of the unrest that exists.    Animprovement in the. means of. transport; might automaticallyresult in a. reduotion of prioes; but -however  it may be,;   effeoted, no. time should be lost, , OSie Press accounts, of speculations, suoh as.the contemplated purchase ofI^noashirs ootton firms, of huge profits,and of abnormalextravaganoe are doing great mischief,,.THE LIQUOR CQNTiiQL.    &apos;mere is a strong feeling in certain districts that- there should now be a modification of the closing; hours, whioh pr ess very hardly upon the coal miners whooome off shift in the&quot;s^terhooh an&quot;dyoan obtain no- beer.ma HOUSING QUESTION.!Kie attitude of builders to the proposed Governmentsubsidy is an interesting study.    There seems to be ageneral opinion among them that private enterprise willbe/
M     V    Mibe hampered in competition with the Munioipal Authorities,who will let houses on an uneconomic basis.    2hebuilders in Wales say that the present high price   ofmaterial is due to the aotion of the Government incornering it until the Army huts and spare buildingmaterial oan be sold at high prices.    W correspondentat Stoke-on-Trent sends the following reportBuilders in this area do not appear to approveof the Government housing scheme.    Uiey oomplainthat theirs was the only business kept down by theGovernment during the war.    Ihey were not allowedto raise rents;   in the Potteries the present rentsdo not pay for repairs and house property has notinoreased in value.      Ihey are not anxious toresume building while ihe prioes of material are sohigh, but are content to do other people&apos;s repairs.The Government subsidy of  150 per house is anenoouragement, but they are wondering what workingman is going to pay the rent on a  750 house (that &quot;is what they consider a decent workman&apos;s house willcost) on an estimate of Jfi on the builder&apos;a outlay,ftiese men oonslder that if house rents had gone uppro ratio with the prioes of food, etc., theposition to-day would have been just the opposite.Builders would have been anxious to build and theunemployment question would have been well on theway to solution.What will happen vhen the time oomeB for repealingthe rients Limitation Aot has not yet begun to ooncern theworking class.    It must, of oourse, inevitably resultin a demand for higher wages,
to mkWAmyzm of the jgiim rousTiEESThe fellct on the amalgamation, to whioh I refer,jin a previous report, has resulted so far in a largemajority for the soheme.    The figures given by Tom Manat Coventry on November 23rd areBallot papers issued..... 397-939&quot; &quot;    returned... 2^5,700For the scheme............202,000Against the fc-oheme.......   23,700He added that 56^ of the members voted, and of these89&amp;% were in favour of the scheme.    An analysis of the&apos;published figures shows that in the o&amp;se of theToolmakers, Engineers and Machinists and ElectricalTrades Unionists the total number of papers returned w. less than 50% of those issued; the votes of thesesocieties were therefore ineffective.   The BoilermakersBlaoksmiths and Shipwrights, who also voted in favour camalgamation, show Bimilar apathy; only 165 over therequisite 50$ voted.   The membership now stands at21,647 and the funds total  68,390. 14. 3.Tom Mann*s oomments were illuminating; he was allfor militancy with adequate preparation.   At presentthey oould not feed their wives and ohildren during abig dispute, but there was one agenoy that liiey ooulduse and that was the Co-operative Movement; they mustall become oo-operators.   He did not say what wouldhappen if the Government oommandeered the co-operativereserves of food for the benefit of the community.THE CLASS WAR IN TRADE UNION iff!P0.a?SThe November report of the United Society ofBoilermakers is a sign of the times.   One editorialnote/
note of the georetary is an instigation to Class War, andthe whole editorial is purely political and has nothing todo with the affairs, of the Union.   Ihe following is aquotation j-&quot;jhe Government have set up committees and they&quot;are fining the little retail profiteers, who charge&quot;3d. for an ounoe of pepper which should only be&quot;2&amp;d.   Vi/hat are they doing with big profiteers?&quot;what will they do with financiers who have made&quot;some temporary loans to the nation at a high rate, &quot;of interest? :, -,Vt      u^to-&quot;During the railway strike these lenders demanded&quot;an additional one per oent interest and netted an&quot;additional 15 millions.  We will do nothing with&quot;these men,   Ihey do not oome under the Aot.   (They&quot;are too big.   They are gentlemen.   They live on&quot;unearned inoome..-&quot;If a poor housewife was found trying to get&quot;more than her ration pf sugar so that she might&quot;eoonomise by making her own jam she was fined.&quot;The Government hoarded stores of food in various&quot;centres to enable them to reduoe the wages of the&quot;railway men.  At tfewoastle alone some thousand of&quot;carcases were kept until they were unfit for food&quot;and they were destroyed along with vast stores of; &quot;tinned food.&quot; -..&apos;The i&amp;tarterly rieport of the Associated Blaoksmiths andIronworkers devotes no less than ten pages to the same kindof propaganda.VIOLENT SPEECHESAddressing the British Socialist Party at Sheffield onNovember 16th, Mr. Owen Ford of Warsop said:-&quot;I am prepared to wade khee-deep through human&quot;blood to achieve 1&amp;e extermination of the Capitalist&quot;olass.   Organise on industrial lines, have a 24 hour&quot;strike every week, keep on jabbing the Government with&quot;industrial pin pricks until they become 8iok and&quot;retire, or acknowledge the iuissian Bolshevik Government.&quot;Out greatest hope of emancipation lies in the East;-&quot;the wise men oome from the East, the wild men oome&quot;from the West,   dhe Parliamentary system of Government&quot;is played out, it has not the power to-day whioh it&quot;had when the Barons and Capitalist olass used it for&quot;their own interests.   It is now only a smoke soreen&quot;used by the Capitalist olass and Lloyd George is their&quot;seoretary; he treats it with oontempt and only visits&quot;it in response to publio olamour.&quot;At/m   0^   mm
At the Coats meeting at Glasgow on November 20th(Councillor David Kirkwood said:- fj&quot;I would murder the individuals who stand&quot;between,the necOHuaries of life and the children&quot;of my olafts.   I want you to be prepared if necessary&quot;to go to prison or anywhere else.   If I had my way,&quot;you oan take it from mo, 1 would not stop at murder,&quot;becauee the. Coats and the ruling olass in general&quot;of tills country deliberately and&apos; callously murder&quot;the ohildren of my ola&amp;a,   They don&apos;t oare how many&quot;of our ohildren are sacrificed on the altar of&quot;capitalism, so long as they get their dividends.&quot;At a British Socialist Party meeting at Sheffield onNovember 23rd, Albert tfl&amp;rd said:-&quot;I do not think the Triple Alliance can defeat&quot;the Government, not while the Government rotain&quot;control of the Army and Navy and the. political&quot;machinery.   I consider the &quot;psyoholcgiual mnmont&quot;had arrived when the sooial revolution oould have&quot;been realised,- at &quot;the time&apos;when the Army was in&quot;a state of revolt.   Whether we can, or not, rely&quot;upon the Army coming over can only: be known when&quot;tested, but the army is now composed of lads from, &quot;Xo to 20, and they easily respondto others.   We&quot;must get hold of the politioal machinery and then we&quot;can handle the armed forces of&quot;the country; on the&quot;industrial field mass action and quick aotion oan&quot;only be effective; I do not favour the guerilla&quot;kind of war.   I have ohanged my opinion and do not n&quot;think it necessary that everybody will have to be&quot;converted before the revolution can be brought&quot;about.   It is possible that a few men in every oity&quot;and town will be able to take over the looal&quot;political machinery.   I advise you to form your&quot;Committee and organisations with that end in view,&quot;as they are doing in other parts of the oountry.&quot;PROPAGANDA IN HIS MAJESTY&apos; 3 FORCESI am informed that several young artificers,meohanics and shipwrights, who have recently joined theNavy, are In the pay of the Independent Labour Partyand have joined with a view to spreading unrest in theServioe.THE FEELING .AU0ITG EX-SE^VICajiM.&apos; .There is somo grumbling about the reduction of the &apos;Unemployment Donation, and there Is considerable frictionwith/
with the Trades Unions, especially with the ivmalgamatedSooiety of Engineers whom the Birmingham ex-soldiers oallthe &quot;Autoorats of Trade Unionism.&quot;THE SOCIALIST LABOUR PAitfiTYThis Party appears to hove made some headway in -jaEdinburgh which is usually less revolutionary than Glasgow.On November 10th about 1,200 people attended a meeting tooommemorate the -Russian Bolshevik evolution, and passedresolutions usual at such meetings.LABOUxi COOlTCII&amp;OagThe labour men recently returned at the MunioipalElections have not yet begun to make themselves oonspiouous.Their present pre-oooupation seems to be to make their offloea paid one.   Many of them appear to be quite sensible andmoderate,flbe Liverpool Labour Farty has issued an urgent appealfor funds for the depleted Party Eleotion acoount.   InBootle, Birkenhead and Liverpool attempts have been madeunsuccessfully to get dismissed polioemen appointed to theWatoh Committees,The Polioe Unioi.

It has had a favourable reply from the LabourMayor of Shoreditoh, but amongst the dismissed policementhere is a bitter feeling of resentment against the Trades.Unions and a oonviotion that they are &quot;down and out&quot;.AH INCIDENT iVT-GLASGOW - u-r-         -At a meeting of the ^eoonstruotion Sooiety on November24th, one of the speakers referred to Karl Marx as a GermanJew/
Jew, whereupon a heokler interjeoted, &quot;What about ourKing?&quot;   Sailors, soldiers and oivilians promptly threwthemselves upon the interjeqtor and hustled him out ofthe crowd, with threats as to what might happen to him ifhe attempted that kind of interruption again.JjHa &quot;DAILY ,piUpwThe oampaign for obtaining funds for the &quot;DailyHerald&quot; appears to be meeting with some suocess,   AProvisional Committee for obtaining support from the TradeBUnions oonsists ofhr, Henderson,Mr, Prank Kodgesir, W. C. JtobinsonHr, Thomas, M.F.I\-r. Ben TurnerMr. ^tobert Williamskr. Ernest Bevin (Hon. Secretary).a. gooo many branohes have reoommended to tlieirExecutive a grant of funds, and the Hammersmith carpentershave suggested a levy of 1/- a head.   In toe West addingof Yorkshire the movement appears to be gaining some head-way.   On the other hand, in Coventry the sale is desoribedas very poor, md in Birmingham and the Black Country notgood.   In South Wales, on the other hand, the circulationIs reported to have doubled sinoe the railway strike.IRELAND .. i    . .Ihere have been no indications of any ohange in thestate of publio opinion during the past week, but from thepoint of view of those engaged in endeavouring to maintainlaw and order the period was an unsatisfactory one over alarge part of the Provinces and raids for arms and otheroutrages were very numerous, especially in Munster.Sinn/
y iSinn Fein is making no apparent progress and itspublio activities are still mainly oonfined toprepax-ations for the 1-ooal Government Elections inJanuary end trying to promote the Irish National Loan.AS regards the elections, Sinn Fein is uneasy as to theattitude of Labour, whioh is becoming more and moreindependent, and a circular recently issued by theprovincial Sinn Fein organizer for kunster, a copy ofwhich has been seized by the polioe, shows whatelaborate plans are being made.   In County Fermanaghthe itoman Catholic Clergy are influencing theirparishioners to vote Sinn Fein t and a number of theyounger Clergy in the North may be expected to aotsimilarly.   It is evident from this week&apos;s &quot;Old Ireland&quot;that Sinn Fein fears lest its system of oo-operativestores may estrange the shop-keeping olass and it isparticularly anxious to keep the large body of itssupporters, who also belong to the Irish Transport andGeneral Workers Union from antagonising the farmers.The labour position shows no material change.   Theironfounders strike in Belfast, Wexford, Lurgan andsmaller places is still unsettled and is seriouslyourtailing work and causing unemployment in the Belfast &apos;Shipyards.   In connection with this the stoppage of theout of work donation to civilians has aroused someuneasiness end on the 2ist instant an open air meeting,attended, hovover, by less than a thousand persons, andaddressed by Uccal Sooialist and Independent Labour Partyleaders, was held outside the City Hall, Belfast, to demandthat the donation be continued.   The language of thespeakers does not appear to have been extreme.B.&apos; H. T.
