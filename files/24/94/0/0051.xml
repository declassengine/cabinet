General.Nil.Part II. Departmental.The Industrial Courts Act.Wages questions and trade disputes during the period since the armistice haveemphasised three main points. In the first place, the object of the Wages (Temporary)Regulation Acts of 1918 and 1919 has only been fulfilled imperfectly. The interval hasbeen occupied in many trades, as was intended, with the formulation of arrangements(0 1933)  255 12/19  h * 8 3 q
for establishing wages on a permanent basis. But this work still remains to be donein many industries, including a number of the most important. A general opinion wasconsequently expressed that Lhe main provisions of the Wages (Temporary) RegulationActs should be continued, and that wages should be stabilised for a sufficient further periodto allow of agreement on a future wage basis. In the second place, experience hasemphasised the opinions expressed by the &quot; Whitley&quot; Committee as to the need forsupplementing existent machinery for conciliation by the establishment of a permanentarbitration tribunal. Thirdly, the experience of the great strikes of the year, andespecially the railway strike, has made abundantly clear the fact that public opinionmust be regarded as one of the most important factors, and that, to arrive at an equitablesettlement, it is desirable that, so far as possible, the public shall be possessed of adequateinformation on the facts of the dispute. To this need also the Whitley Committee drewattention.   The Industrial Courts Act represents an attempt to meet these three needs.In the first place, the main principles of the Wages (Temporary) Regulation Actsare extended, and will remain in operation until the 30th September, 1920, but, at thesame time, important modifications are introduced. Provision is made for the paymentby employers of not less than prescribed rates of wages to particular classes of workpeoplein particular districts, or, alternatively, rates which have been substituted for theseprescribed rates by an Award of the Interim Court of Arbitration, an agreement orsettlement approved by the Minister, or an Order issued by the Minister extending thescope of an award. These rates still have statutory sanction, and the Local MunitionsTribunals still have judicial power to enforce them. But under the Industrial CourtsAct it is no longer possible to create new substituted rates with statutory effect, exceptunder certain circumstances, in the case of women. Neither employers nor employeescan force to arbitration such claim in future, and any decision of the IndustrialCourt laying down a new rate must depend for sanction on moral obligation. Equallyit is- no longer possible for the Ministry of Labour to create a substituted rate by theapproval of agreements, or to extend Awards or agreements by Order. Thus thedetermination of new rates become once more a matter of free negotiation and arbitrationbetween employers and employed. The only awards of the Industrial Court to whichstatutory obligation attaches, are decisions as to whether in any given case there is aprescribed rate, and, if so, what is the prescribed rate or the substituted rate alreadyexistent.The Industrial Court, therefore, after the temporary need for the stabilisation ofwages has ceased, Avill exist exclusively as a permanent supplement to the existentmachinery for conciliation and arbitration. Reference to it may be made in regard to anymatter relating to or arising out of a dispute. But an arbitration reference may be madeonly by agreement of both parties, and only when other means of settlement which mayexist in the industry concerned have been brought into operation without success. TheAct, therefore, does not in any way interfere with the conciliation functions, for example,which have in many cases been assumed by the Joint Industrial Councils. Other formsof arbitration tribunals continue, and if both parties to a dispute desire it, can still beutilised. But the general policy of the Ministry of Labour will be to refer cases notsettled by the existing conciliation machinery to the Industrial Court for determina-tion. The constitution of the Court is sufficiently elastic to allow of rapid settle-ment. Cases may be heard in important centres other than London, and individualmembers of the Court may be instructed, in suitable cases, to undertake a local hearing.The value of the Court must depend upon the extent to which unionists and employersare willing to substitute arbitration for the strike and the lock-out. But habit, and theknowledge that permanent machinery exists should have considerable influence inbringing about the desired change.It remains to deal with the powers conferred on the Minister of Labour to inquireinto disputes which may not be referred by joint consent for settlement. In such casesthe Minister is empowered to establish a Court of Inquiry, and need not require the consentof the parties. It is not necessary to wait until a dispute actually exists; a Court ofInquiry may be set up where a dispute is only apprehended. The business of such a Courtis one of simple inquiry; it can issue a report, but not give an award. Its function isto report to the Ministry of Labour, and through it to both Houses of Parliament, andfor this purpose it has the right to demand the production of evidence. In this way animpartial statement may be obtained for the guidance both of the Government andthe public in their attitude to any trade dispute.
Part III.-Press Comments.(1) The Labour and Socialist Press.Housing.The new departures in the housing policy of the Government are discussed in all papers,,and the proposal to subsidise private building meets with almost universal condemnation.The &quot; Democrat&quot; is the only paper which is favourable to the scheme, and this journalapparently thinks that greater progress might be made by lowering the standard of thehouses to be built in the present emergency. &quot; The cry is for houses for any reasonablehouse so long as it can be made into a home.&quot; This preference for quantity rather thanquality is not shared by the other papers. The objection of &quot; Justice &quot; and the &quot; Worker &quot;to the bonus scheme is that it will encourage the building of jerry-built houses. The&quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; the &quot; Leeds Weekly Citizen &quot; and the &quot; New Statesman &quot; thinkthat the new proposals will make still more difficult the progress of municipal housingschemes. The &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; and the &quot; New Age &quot; both regard the lack of progressin housing as a typical example of the failure of Capitalism to provide for the social needsof the community, since its system of distribution is based on the provision of the goodsand services required by those best able to pay for them, i.e., of luxuries for the rich.(See below.) Allegations of profiteering laid against the providers of housing materialare common. It is noteworthy that very little reference is made to the supply of labourand output questions, and no constructive suggestions on these topics are made.Coal Industry.The reduction in the price of coal supplied for domestic consumption arouses asmuch attention as the proposal to subsidise private building, and has as bad a receptionin these papers. The only article, however, worthy of note is one contributed to the&quot; Democrat &quot; by Mr. E. Gittins, who argues that it would have been a much wiser policyto use the anticipated profit on coal for a reduction in all coal prices. He thinks that areduction on industrial coal of 2s. per ton would have been far more beneficial ultimatelyto the consumer than the policy adopted. There is no criticism of importance this weekbearing upon the larger issues of the coal industry problem. With reference, however,to the suggestion prevalent last week that the railwaymen were accepting a scheme ofjoint control much less advanced than the miners&apos; proposals, it may be noted that the&quot; New Age &quot; preserves its unique position by insisting that the railwaymen are pursuingan identical course with the miners.Out-of-Work Donation.The discussion arising out of the stopping of the out-of-work donation is continuedthis week by the more extreme writers in the more extreme papers. Mr. T. Quelch in&quot; The Call &quot; bases upon it an exposure of the ethics of capitalism. His opinion is thatthe out-of-work donation was only granted in order to prevent the working classes becomingrevolutionary, and that the stoppage of the donation is a result of this fear being no longerentertained in ruling circles. Therefore, he suggests that steps should be taken to increasethis dread of revolution a national conference of the organised working-class movementshould be called to consider &quot; what immediate action should be taken to compel the autho-rities to provide useful work or else proper maintenance for the unemployed.&quot; Mr. WilliamStewart, in &quot;Forward,&quot; discusses the history of the donation in.a similar spirit. Heregards the withdrawal of the donation as a sign of a return to normal capitalism. Hethinks that the existence once more of a margin of unemployed men will render futile allplans for the reconstruction of industry along the lines of Industrial Councils, Wages Boards,&amp;c, but he points out to the worker that he has a remedy for the situation, namely,&quot; ca&apos; canny.&quot; The &quot; Socialist&quot; discusses the situation from the standpoint of revolu-tionary communism, and approves of the withdrawal of the donation. The existence ofthe donation made it all the&apos; harder for this paper to propagate communist ideals.Industrial Courts Act.The &quot; British Citizen &quot; devotes much attention this week to the terms of this Act,and a full page is devoted to explaining its provisions. A certain amount of criticism ismade. The &quot; British Citizen,&quot; somewhat late in the day, takes up the view of the LabourParty that Part III of the Act should have been passed as a separate measure, and thatParts I and II of the Act should have been based upon more careful deliberation. lu theopinion of this paper the great defect of the Act is that it does not contain any provisionmaking it illegal to declare a strike without a ballot being taken of the trade unionists,concerned.  Mr. D. Irving, M.P., welcomes the measure in &quot;Justice.&quot;(C 1&quot;32) 3 Q 2
Prices and Profiteering.This subject is the one at the present time of greatest interest to the Labour andSocialist Press. The objection of these papers to the housing subsidy is really that it willbenefit the &quot; profiteer &quot; at the expense of the State. Doubts as to whether the Governmentreally would limit the profits of coal owners has been an added grievance in the matter of (coal prices. The continuance of high prices provides these papers with additional argu-ments for the maintenance of the out-of-work donation for civilians and against thereduction in the amount of the donation for ex-soldiers. The so-called Anti-DumpingBill is criticised by Mr. J. C. Wedgwood, M.P., in &quot; Forward,&quot; on similar grounds. Hecomplains that no limitation of profits is suggested for the companies concerned with keyindustries. This week Mr. J. Terretfs complaints against the administration of theProfiteering Act appear in both &quot; Justice &quot; and the &quot; British Citizen.&quot; The latter papercomplains that the people of the country are being exploited in order to cover the blundersof the Ministry of Food, and suggests that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministryof Food is not suitable for the position of Chairman of the Central Profiteering Committee.In &quot; The Call,&quot; Mr. J. Maclean discusses the recent rises in prices as indicated by the &quot; LabourGazette &quot; figures. He approves of the suggestion that a fight for lower prices is a betterpolicy for trade unionism to adopt than a fight for higher wages. This is interesting inview of the attitude recently adopted by the miners of Great Britain and the railwaymenof America upon this point. The &quot; New Age &quot; considers speeches by the Food Controllerand the Minister of Transport, and complains that the money or currency factor in pricesis ignored, though it is as important as the supply or the export of goods. This paperpoints out that high prices do not matter to people whose purchasing power expandswith a rise in prices, and upon this bases a conclusion that the only wise policy is to securean equitable distribution of purchasing power among the people who need the goods.It is here, thinks the &quot; New Age,&quot; that Capitalism breaks down, for under Capitalism thenon-possessing classes can only receive money by doing work. &quot; Work is the supply ofcommodities in response to an effective demand,&quot; and in consequence of the presentunequal distribution of purchasing power the demand for luxuries by the rich is moreeffective than the demand for necessities by the poor. The &quot; New Age &quot; illustrates thisresult by quoting the refusal of the Ministry of Food to prohibit the manufacture ofchocolates and sweets until the supply of sugar for domestic use is normal, because of theunemployment that would result from the cessation of the manufacture of these articles.The &quot; New Age &quot; is also of the opinion that the difficulties arising out of the distributionof purchasing power are at the bottom of much of the trouble that is being met with bythe Ministry of Health in its housing schemes. The clarity of this diagnosis on the partof the &quot; New Age &quot; loses, however, some of its value owing to the refusal of this paperto confide to its readers any specific remedial prescription.(2) Ex-Service Metis Periodicals..  Nil.Part IV. General Topics.The General Situation.The Labour world is waiting for the special Trades Union Congress which is to be heldon the 9th and 10th December. Praetcally all the large issues of the moment will comebefore that Congress for discussion, and in the meantime, therefore, the attitude of Labouris one of expectation. It is probable, boo, that whatever the result of the deliberationsof the Congress the present period of conference and negotiation will continue until thefurther Congress which it is intended to call in February. At the moment the only issueon which untoward developments in the near future may be feared is the question ofthe standardisation of railwaymen&apos;s wages, and this matter will not come before theT.U.C. Mr. Thomas and Mr. Cramp have in the last few days expressed their doubt of asuccessful solution of the problem, and if the railwaymen decide not to accept the Govern-ment terms, they will be bound, under the agreement reached at the meeting of the TripleAlliance last week, to refer the matter to the Alliance. In that case the Alliance mighteither decide on a policy of direct action, or (which is much more probable) might referthe matter to the special T.U.C. to be held in February.
TJie Forthcoming Trades Union Congress.Although the development of the problems which will be considered at the specialCongress in London on the 9th and 10th inst. is of recent date, it may be useful in orderto provide a historical setting for the proceedings at the Congress, which will be dealt within the Report next week, to recall the main features of the negotiations that have takenplace in connection with these problems. The purpose of this Congress was originallydefined by the Trades Union Congress in Glasgow in its resolution on Nationalisation.It was there resolved to instruct the Parliamentary Committee, in conjunction with theMiners&apos; Federation, to interview the Prime Minister in the name of the entire labourmovement, to insist upon the Government^ adopting the Majority Report of the SankeyCommission ; and it was further resolved that in the event of the Government still refusingto accept this position a special Congress should be convened for the purpose of decidingthe form of action to be taken to compel the Government to accept the Majority Reportof the Commission. A resolution was also carried instructing the Parliamentary Committeeto demand of the Government the repeal of the Military Service Acts and the immediatewithdrawal of the British troops from Russia, and failing this, the immediate calling of aspecial Congress to decide what action should be taken. In accordance with the formerof these resolutions the Parliamentary Committee of the T.U.C. and the executive of theM.F.G.B. met the Prime Minister on the 9th October, and received his announcementthat the Government could not see their way to advise Parliament to nationalise theindustry. The situation created by the attitude of the Government was quietly consideredby the two bodies, and on the .12th November they again met and made arrangementsfor the holding of the special Congress on the 9th and 10th December.The other two subjects which the Glasgow Congress resolved should be referred to aspecial Congress, in case of unsatisfactory Government assurances, have receded into thebackground. Conscription is no longer a &quot; live issue,&quot; and the withdrawal of Britishtroops from Russia has taken most of the force out of the Labour protest against inter-vention. Efforts to maintain the campaign continue, but, as has been pointed out in thisReport, the propaganda has grown largely academic, and now consists simply of thedemand for a cessation of supplies and financial assistance to Denikin and Koltchak, andfor the establishment of diplomatic relations with the de facto Soviet Government ofRussia.   Both these questions will, however, be dealt with at the Congress.In the meantime, it may be noted, three other subjects have come into prominence,and in each case it was decided to refer them also to the special Congress. The first ofthese was the question of the cost of living, which the delegate Conference of the M.F.G.B.on the 23rd October discussed and resolved to refer to the Congress in order that anopportunity might be provided for the Labour movement &quot; to decide upon a policywhich has for its object the reduction of the cost of living.&quot; Another question which hasbeen referred to the Congress is the problem of the reorganisation of the central authorityin the trade union movement and the establishment of a so-called&apos;&quot; General Staff forLabour.&quot; This movement is, of course, not new, and it was expected that the GlasgowCongress would have discussed the whole problem. It was pointed out in this Reportfor the week ending the 10th September that the view was held that &quot; the T.U.C. shouldbe free, through a really strong executive, to devote itself to an effort in the industrialsphere to link up the sectional efforts and programmes of labour into a common policyand scheme of action.&quot;* The whole question was shelved at the Glasgow Congress owingto its pre-occupation with &quot; direct action,&quot; but a new impulse was given to the movementby events connected with the railway strike, which showed (a) the weakness of theParliamentary Committee as at present constituted, and (b) the need for and the possibilitiesof a strong central executive possessing de jure the powers which the hastily improvisedMediation Committee exercised de facto. The very recent progress of the movement forthe constitution of this central authority has been noted week by week in this Reportand need not be recapitulated. The last question which has been referred to the Congressis the problem of unemployment. This issue has been brought into the programme as aconsequence of the decision of Parliament to discontinue the out-of-work donation&apos; tocivilians.The Agenda of the Congress contains the following resolutions which the ParliamentaryCommittee will present for adoption, by the Congress :-(1) That this Congress . . . decides to defer its decision until an adjournedCongress, which shall beheldafter the reassembling of Parliament next February;and that at such adjourned Congress the Trade Union movement will be calledupon to give effect to clause (o)f of the Nationalisation resolution of the Glasgow* Page 216.t 1 his clause is stated above.
Congress, 1919, unless the Government have, in the interim, decided to irstro-duce legislation accepting the principle of the nationalisation of the coal mines -as set forth in the Report of the Coal Industry Commission.(2) That this Congress protests against the Government^ continued indifference tothe abnormal profiteering engaged in by the large commercial and monopolyinterests controlling the essentials of life.......As a means ofregulating prices, we demand that the Government should take immediate stepsto secure effective control of raw materials required for the manufacture ofvital commodities, including the materials required for house building, theproduction of food, clothing, and other essentials of life. We also reaffirm thedecision of previous Congresses that the complete national ownership andcontrol of land, mines, minerals, railways, and other means of transport is theonly effective method of securing for the community adequate protectionagainst the operations of monopoly and profiteering interests.&apos; The questions of unemployment and the Military Service Acts and Russia will bethe subject of an interview with the Prime Minister on the 8th December ; and as a resultof this interview the Parliamentary Committee will make recommendations to the Congress.A resolution dealing with the reorganisation of the Central authority in the Labour move-in ent will also be proposed.   This is as follows : That . . . the Parliamentary Committee be instructed to revise the StandingOrders of Congress in such manner as is necessary to secure the following changes in thefunctions and duties of the executive body elected by Congress : (1) To substitute for the Parliamentary Committee a Trades Union Congress GeneralCouncil to be elected annually by Congress.(2) To prepare a scheme determining the composition and methods of election of theGeneral Council.(3) To make arrangements for the development of administrative departments in theoffices of the General Council, in the direction of securing the necessary officials,staff, and equipment to secure an efficient Trade Union centre.Further, the Parliamentary Committee be instructed to consult with the LabourParty and the Co-operative Movement with a view to devising a scheme for the settingup of departments under joint control responsible for effective national and internationalservice in the following and any other necessary directions : (a) Research : To secure general and statistical information on all questions affectingthe worker as producer and consumer by the co-ordination and development ofexisting agencies.(6) Legal advice on all questions affecting the collective welfare of the members ofworking-class organisations,(c) Publicity, including preparation of suitable literature dealing with questionsaffecting the economic, social, and political welfare of the people :  withmachinery for inaugurating special publicity campaigns to meet emergenciesof an industrial or political character.Nationalisation of the Mines.A meeting of the committee representing four national organisations, viz., the TradesUnion Congress, the Labour Party, the Miners&apos; Federation, and the Co-operative Move-ment, which are to conduct the platform campaign for the nationalisation of the coal-mining industry, met at the House of Commons on the 27th ult., and arrangements weremade for the campaign. In view of the widely-proclaimed solidarity of the whole TradeUnion and Co-operative Movement on the question of the nationalisation of the mines,it is interesting to note that an opposition campaign is being conducted by miners in SouthWales. On the 30th November, it is reported, at a meeting of miners at the SenghenyddClub Lecture Hall, the following resolution was unanimously carried : &quot; That this meeting,representing 500 members of the S.W.M.F., protests against the suggested nationalisationof the mines, and considers the proposal to be bad for the State and bad for every man whois engaged in the coal industry.&quot; It is reported that the leaders of this campaign intendto hold a series of meetings in the ensuing weeks in South Wales, and that they areadvocating, asa&quot; constructive suggestion.&quot; a plan which would provide that the minersshould first receive a basic wage after which the owner should receive an adequate return,on his capital, and that any profits remaining after these sums had been paid should bedivided in proportions to be agreed upon between the two.   There is no likelihood at all
that this campaign will have any marked success. The miners as a whole are determinedto carry through their programme of nationalisation, and small counter-campaigns, mainlypolitical, will not deflect them from their purpose. The miners&apos; leaders as yet give no i ndica*tion of the methods which they intend to adopt to secure their ends, but Mr. &quot;Hodgescontinues to declare that if no political avenue opens up, the workers will have to &quot; expresstheir ideals &quot; in a more drastic manner. It is clear, however, from the terms of the resolu-tion on nationalisation to be proposed at the special Congress on the 9th inst. that nothingdrastic &quot; is contemplated before February..The Railway Negotiations.No further progress has been made in the negotiations between the Government andthe railwaymen&apos;s unions on the standardisation of wages and the control of the railways.Mr. J. H. Thomas and Mr. C. T. Cramp spoke during the week end at March and Newportrespectively, and both expressed dissatisfaction with the position of the wage question.Mr. J. H. Thomas pointed out that the railwaymen were -expecting a settlement on thequestion of standardisation before the end of the year, and the progress made was notsuch as satisfied him that it was likely to be accomplished. The wages proposal nowbefore them would not be acceptable to the railwaymen. He hoped, however, as a resultof negotiations next week, that a more hopeful - proposal would be put before them. Mr.Cramp was less hopeful of a satisfactory solution and declared that the 40.5. minimum wouldhave to disappear from the amended wage proposals before any settlement could take place,and on the present basis there could be no hope of this. With regard to the problem Ofcontrol, it may be noted that the West Brompton No. 1 Branch of the N.U.R. has con-sidered the scheme for joint control as outlined by Mr. Thomas at Bristol, and has decidedto instruct its A.G.M. delegate to oppose the proposal on the ground that it is no betterthan that offered to the miners. This decision although made simply by a local branch,is significant as the emergence within the N.TJ.R. of a standpoint similar to that adoptedby the miners&apos; leaders, as was pointed out last week, in their attitude towards the railwayscheme of control without nationalisation.Income-Tax.A delegate conference of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation considered on the 1stinst. the result of the ballot on the question of striking as a protest against the paymentof income-tax on wages not exceeding  250 per annum. The final figures of the ballotshowed that 73,307 had voted for a strike and 72,837 against, giving a majority of 470 infavour of a strike. After a long discussion the Conference decided that the majority wastoo narrow to justify a strike, and it was resolved to defer action pending a Conferenceof the M.F.G.B., at which a proposal will be made that the M.F.G.B. should authorisea national ballot on the question. The result of the ballot bears striking evidence to thestrength of the unofficial movement in South Wales, as the majority voted in directopposition both to the instructions of their own Council and to the policy of the M.F.G.B.as declared at its conference on the 22nd October. An unofficial movement of a differentkind, but also in South Wales, is noted in the paragraph on the Nationalisation of theMines.The Triple Alliance.The Triple Alliance, at its meeting on the 27th inst., discussed certain aspects of therailway strike, and the executives of the constituent unions exchanged reports on theprogress of their respective programmes. According to the official report, issued byMr. Hodges, Mr. Smillie, who presided, said that the Triple Alliance, like every otherpowerful organisation, would only be effective in the degree in which it utilised its ownexperience in perfecting its methods. He pointed out that the common interests of miners,railwaymen and transport workers welded them together into a labour phalanx-whichwould be strong enough to resist the attacks of the most powerful Capitalist combinationsand secure for its members their joint demands. Mr. J. H. Thomas, in his resume ofthe proceedings which led up to the railway strike, explained, apparently somewhatapologetically, that the railwaymen sought a settlement up to the last moment, and whenthe breakdown came it was too late to utilise the machinery of the. Alliance in any effectivemanner. The following resolution was passed : &quot; That this joint meeting of the threeexecutives congratulates the railwaymen on their fight for standardisation, and wishesthem and the miners and the transport workers continued success in the fruition of theirrespective programmes. In the event of failure of either (sic) of the three bodies to securetheir respective demands, the Sub-Committee be instructed to summon a full meeting of
the three executives to consider the whole question.&quot; A resolution was also carriedexpressing the strongest disapproval of the treatment of trade unionists in the UnitedStates.The interesting feature of this meeting was its character, which was retrospectiverather than prospective. In the past, the Triple Alliance has always met as a preliminaryto action or threatened action, and the policy of &quot; direct action &quot; has become peculiarlyassociated with it. But on this occasion, its eye was not upon the future, or at least wasnot primarily upon the future in any immediate way. It was concerned with the past,and its whole purpose, however it may have been disguised, was the settlement of differencesexisting between the three bodies, which, had this meeting not been held, would havetended to become acute. As it is, harmony has apparently been restored; and theresolution quoted above attempts to secure that none of the constituent unions will takeextreme measures to obtain the satisfaction of their demands without consulting theAlliance as a whole.Unemployment and the Out-of-Work Donation.The abolition of the out-of-work donation to civilians continues to produce a series,of deputations and a spate of protests. The Brighton Town Council on the 28th Novemberreceived a deputation of demobilised men, who made a protest against unemployment inthe town. It was suggested that the tramway profits should be used to repair the tramwaytrack, and thus provide work for some of the unemployed in the town. The GlasgowrCorporation has decided to urge the Government to find work in the city or alternativelyto continue the unemployment dole till those who are idle find work. A deputation fromthe Trades and Labour Council, which interviewed the Glasgow Corporation on the subject,urged that the Government should reduce working hours in the shipyards, and thus absorbidle workers.&apos; The Executive Committee of the Durham Miners&apos; Association has passeda resolution calling upon organised labour to take the necessary steps either to securepayment of donation or the provision of work. The Newcastle Labour Party has organiseda demonstration of unemployed workers in the district. The Party has issued a letterto all unions affiliated to the T.U.C. asking that they shall call a special congress to decidein what circumstances action, shall be taken, if necessary by a general strike. Eesolutionsare reported from Bristol and from Cardiff asking that the donation shall be increasedby 100 per cent. Resolutions of protest are reported from Portsmouth (No. 6) Branchof the A.S.E., Kendal Trades Council, Clerkenwell and Basingstoke Branches of theN.U.R., Handsworth (Birmingham) I.L.P., Edinburgh Laundry Workers, Gatesheadunemployed, West Bromwich Brass Workers, Building Workers&apos; Industrial Union, Wool-wich, Sheffield Corporation, Coventry unemployed, and. Redcar Branch of the A.S.E.Mr. William Brace, in an article in the &quot; Western Mail,&quot; advocates the &quot;right to workor maintenance.&quot; This, he says, appeals to him as a sound doctrine for civilisation to baseits natural economy upon.National Insurance (Unemployment) Acts, 1911-18.A Bill to increase the rate of unemployment benefit payable under these Acts wasintroduced by the Minister in the House of Commons on the 25th November. The increaseis made possible by the accumulation of funds owing to the virtual cessation of paymentsunder these Acts since the out-of-work donation was introduced, and by the margin whichexperience has shown to have been involved in the actuarial basis of the original scheme.The Police Unions and Labour Borough Councils. ---The Police Union has not been long in attempting to take advantage of the successesachieved by Labour in the recent municipal elections. The Union is sending deputationsto all London Borough Councils, and so far it is reported that the Mayors of Shoreditch,Poplar, Stoke Newington and St. Pancras, supported by their Councils, have decided tojoin a movement for a depu^^oh of London Mayors to the Prime Minister to urge thereinstatement of the men dismissed during the recent strike. It is reported that someLondon boroughs are seriously considering the advisability of not authorising the police-rate until the men are reinstated. There is evidence that the Labour Borough Councilsare finding great difficulty in deciding on a general policy in accordance with the inflatedelection promises of their members.Building Trade Conference. (A conference is being arranged to take place at the Central Hall, Westminster, onthe 16th December, to discuss the best means of securing an adequate supply of labour
to cany out the Government housing programme. The meeting will be addressed by thePrime Minister, Dr. Addison, &amp;c. Representatives are being invited from the BuildingTrades J.I.C. and other parties concerned.Trade Union Topics,Engineers and the 4A-hour Week. Some trouble has arisen over the formation of aJoint Committee of the Engineering and Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation and thetrade unions to investigate the relation of production and hours of work, and its effecton a 44-hour week. The men wish that an independent chairman should preside overthe proceedings of the Committee, and the employers have objected to this. It is reportedthat some of the more extreme members would frankly prefer to face the issue if needbe to the extent of a strike. A meeting of the Union Executives has been called to discussthe situation.Colliery Officials&apos; Association of Great Britain. At a meeting of delegates representing10,000 colliery officials in England, Scotland and Wales, held in London on the 24th ult.,it was unanimously resolved to form an association under this title. Mr. John Ritson(Northumberland) was appointed President, and Mr. Thomas Halstead (Bolton) GeneralSecretary.International Labour Conference, Washington.The International Labour Conference at Washington has adopted by overwhelmingmajorities 6 draft Conventions and 6 recommendations. The 6 draft Conventionswill now be submitted to the legislatures of the 40 States which are members of theConference for ratification as treaties, or for incorporation into Law. They establishthe 8-hour day and the 48-hour week principle, with 14 as the minimum age of the employ-ment of children in industry, and they prohibit the employment at night of women andyoung persons under 18, and protect maternity by permitting women to leave their worksix weeks before childbirth, and forbidding their employment for six weeks afterwards.Benefits and guarantees against discharge are assured. They also provide for the sub-mission in each State every three months of data on unemployment. The recom-mendations concern the protection of women and children from lead poisoning, safeguardsagainst anthrax, the creation of a Government Health Service by each State, the adhesionof all States to the Berne Convention against the use of white phosphorus for matchmanufacture, the reciprocal protection of foreign workers, the establishment by eachState of a system of unemployment insurance, the creation of a special section and aspecial Commission on Migration, and the reservation of the construction of all publicworks for periods of unemployment. At a previous session the report of the Committeeon Unemployment was discussed clause by clause, and the various conventions andrecommendations were adopted. The only amendment to the Committee&apos;?, recom-mendations was one equalising European and non-European representatives on theCommission on Migration. Attempts were made to defer the discussion of the wholeunemployment report, and of the Convention for reciprocal rights of foreign workers,and amendments were proposed to request the League of Nations to consider a betterdistribution of the world&apos;s raw materials and equalisation of ocean freight rates. Theseamendments, however, were all defeated.A lengthy discussion took place on the recommendations of the Committee onSpecial Countries with reference to the modifications to be allowed in the 8-hourday principle for certain countries undeveloped industrially, especially Japan. TheConference recommended that the 48-hour week should be introduced in Japanfor workers under 15 and for underground miners, a 60-hour week for silk workers and a57-hour week for other industries, with overtime and a 24-hour rest period according toWestern standards. The Japanese Labour Delegate protested against these modificationsand he was supported hy the Labour delegates of Belgium, Holland, France and Italy,mainly on the ground that the fear of Japanese competition was often used to preventlabour improvements in Europe. Mr. Barnes, however, maintained that the modificationswere absolutely essential and pointed out that Japan had made great concessions in grantinga reduction of working time in factories of from 17 to 22 hours a week in the case of theCotton Industry, a reform which would necessitate the importation of U- millions spindleswhich would take three years to instal. It was not possible for Japan to do right awaywhat it had taken Europe over 100 years to do.The Governing Body of the International Labour Office has been elected. It willhold office for three years. The twelve countries selected to have government representa-tives are Belgium, France, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Spain,Argentine, Canada, Poland and Denmark; the last named pending the appointment of(C 1932) 3 E

The employers&apos; representa-tives are : Sir Allan Smith (Great Britain), Guerin (France), Pirelli (Italy), Carlier(Belgium), Hodage (Czecho-Slovakia), and Schindler (Switzerland), pending the appoint-ment of an American. Protests against this arrangement have been made by China andIndia, and by Mr. Crawford and Mr. Geinmill of South Africa, and the Latin-Americancountries have unanimously signed a protest requesting the Conference to amend theinjustice of allotting to the group of 20 Latin-American countries only one representativeout of the total of 24 composing the Governing Body of the International Labour Office.The International Labour Office will be charged with collecting and distributing informa-tion, with preparing the agendas for the annual meeting of the Conference and with editingand publishing a periodical dealing with problems of industry and employment ofinternational interest.

The Nation 1 Steam Car Garageat Nunhead is closing down and 560 workpeople are affected.Employment of ex-Service Men. Local Employment Committees are suggesting thatthe rule of the National Scheme that 5 per cent, of the whole staff should be disabled menshould not be rigidly enforced in the case of those firms whose normal staff consists almostwholly of women and who employ as large a percentage of disabled men as the nature oithe work permits.(C 1932) 3 R 2
Out-of-Work Donation. Dover and Ramsgate Employment Committees protestagainst the cessation of civilian out-of-work donation pending the extension of unemploy-ment insurance. The former Committee submits that the impossibility of obtaininghousing accommodation prevents the transfer of unemployed workpeople to suitableemployment in other areas. The latter urges most strongly that further dischargesshould not be made from Richborough and that the suggestions made at the recentdeputation for the provision of employment should be put into immediate effect.South Midlands and Eastern.Unemployment. The live register for the week ending the 14th November shows anincrease of 576 men and a decrease of 39 women. The extension of work at the King&apos;sLynn Docks and the placing of workpeople with the English Oilfields, Ltd., accounts fora decrease, of 175 at King&apos;s Lynn. The strike of Ironfounders is seriously affectingresettlement at Leicester, Norwich, Reading and Colchester. Increases are reported owingto this cause. In addition, a considerable number of workpeople have been placed onshort time at Bedford. &apos; The closing of the Munitions Inspection Bond at Newbury andthe discharge of workpeople from the Milton depot is a part cause of the increase on theunemployment register at Reading. Numerous discharges have also taken place fromthe Royal Army Ordnance Depot, Colchester.Employment of ex-Service Men. During the period under review, 100 applicationsunder the National Scheme have been accepted by Local Employment Committees and94 applications are under consideration.Out-of-Work Donation.

An increase of 904 men and a decrease of 504- women is shown bythe live, register for the week ending the 14th November. The increase on the men&apos;sregister is wholly due to the ironfounders&apos; strike. The decrease on the women&apos;s registeris attributed to the exhaustion of out-of-work donation.Effects of Ironfounders&apos;&apos; Strike. There have been rapid developments of local feelingamong the ironfounders in the Black Country against the members of the Gas, Municipaland General Workers&apos; Union who have remained at work in the hollow-ware and lightcastings trade. The ironfounders allege that work which they have previously donehas been sent to certain shops where members of the latter union are employed, andbands of strikers have marched to the shops in the Darlaston, West Bromwich and Walsalldistricts for the purpose of bringing out the men employed in these establishments.Their efforts have only further embittered the relations between the unions concerned.The distress amongst the ironfounders themselves and other workers affected by thedispute is acute in many areas. House-to-house collections are being made in Coventryand in parts of Birmingham.Employment of ex-Service Men. 67 undertakings have been approved in Birminghamand 51 are under consideration. It is reported that, owing to the varying proportion inthe number of men and women engaged in local industries, many firms are finding difficultyin completing undertakings under the National Scheme. The continuance of the iron-founders&apos; strike is severely hampering the progress of the scheme.Training. The Greater Birmingham Employment Committee urge the completionof arrangements for the establishment of a local Technical Advisory Committee for thecoachbuilding and wheelwright trades.  This Committee also press for the formulation
of a special training scheme to meet the needs of youths who joined the Forces immediatelyafter their school careers or after a short experience of unskilled industrial work.Training centres for engineering and printing are to be established as Walsall.Out-of-Work Donation.

A special meeting of the National Union of Clerks washeld in Sheffield on the 26th ult., for the purpose of extending the organisation to clerksemployed by estate agents, architects and surveyors. It is reported that the membershipof the Sheffield branch is now 1,500, and that in addition there are 300 members of asecond branch which caters for staff clerks, warehouse managers, &amp;c.Organisation of Barnsley Foremen.

The live register for the week ending the 14th November showsan increase of 342 men and a decrease of 466 women. Discharges from Governmentworks are the cause of heavy increases on the registers at Alexandria, Greenock,Dunfermline and Inverness. Unemployment is steadily increasing at Wick. The positionat Alloa shows signs of improvement on the settlement of the bricklayers&apos; strike, andengineering and shipbuilding firms anticipate an early delivery of material which willpromote a resumption of work. The re-opening of the fishing season has increasedemployment at Aberdeen.Shortage of Material-Uhe shortage of steel plates is still holding up work at theship-repairing and building yards at Leith and causing the suspension of riveters, platers,boilermakers, &amp;c, at Greenock. The shortage of castings is responsible for the paying offof men at engineering works at Johnstone-. The calico printing and dyeing industryat Dumbarton is still affected by lack of raw material.Nero Industrial Developments. The opening of a carpet factory at Newton Stewartand the locating of premises for similar factories at Annan and Dumfries, coupled withthe satisfactory progress of local housing schemes and impending arrangements for securingbricklayers from other areas are a welcome sign of industrial resettlement.Out-of-Work Donation. The stoppage of out-of-work donation for civilians is beingseverely criticised by all Employment Committees, and in some cases resignation is
threatened. Resolutions from the leading towns are already in circulation, and it isfelt that there will be serious dislocation in the activities of these committees.Wales.Unemployment. The live register for the week ending 14th November shows adecrease of 29 men and 223 women. The situation at the Llanelly tinplate works haseased considerably and with a continued rainfall, the trade should soon return to itsnormal state.Shortage of Transport.

The expansion of export figures shows that the work of recapturingthe tinplate markets lost to Wales during the war proceeds apace. The scarcity of labour,however, puts a brake upon the full development of the industry, a large number of tinplateworkers being still retained with the Colours.Training. Cardiff Local Technical Advisory Committee for the Electricity Lightand Power Trades have arranged workshop training for 50 per cent, of the disabled ex-Servicemen who have completed institutional training in electrical engineering and hope to placethe remainder in a short time.Part VI.

The menhave declined, however, to consider these proposals and the dispute continues.Metal, Engineering and Shipbuilding.Ironfownders. It was decided during the week that a further attempt should be madeto bring about a settlement of the strike. In a communication to the Friendly Society ofIronfounders the Engineering and National Employers&apos; Federation stated that &quot;Havingregard to the fact that the Industrial Courts Act is now in operation, wherein provision is madethat the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act, 1918. shall continue in operation until the30th September, 1920, and that the Court of Arbitration have now issued their award, it mightbe desirable that we should resume the discussion where it was left off on the 11th October.&quot;It was accordingly arranged that a joint conference of the Federation and the Executives ofthe Ironfounders&apos;, Coremakers&apos; and Metal Dressers&apos; Unions should be held on the 3rd inst. inLondon. Further communications between the two parties revealed, however, differencesas to what the conditions of the Conference should be and the negotiations broke down.In the meantime the postponed notices of the Scottish ircnmoulders expire on the 3rd hist.An interesting resolution has been passed by members of the Oldham branches of the Moulders&apos;Coremakers&apos;and Metal Dressers&apos; Societies to the effect that &quot; after the strike is over no overtimeshall be worked by members of any of the Societies now on strike for as many weeks as thestrike has lasted.&quot;Tinplate Workers : South Wales. All the picklers employed in the South Wales TinplateTrade came out on strike on the 1st inst. in protest against the alleged delay of the JointIndustrial.Council in dealing with their wages claims. Notices were originally handed in bythe barcutters, but these were withdrawn and only the picklers have come out. The strikeis unofficial and the men&apos;s leaders have declared that the notices are irregular, as the rule isthat one month&apos;s notice shall be given, and that only on the first Monday in the month. Notmore than four or five picklers are employed at each works, but as theirs is an essential processthe firms will have to close down, and it is estimated that about 12,000 workmen will be affected.(For other unofficial movements in South Wales, see Part IV.)Engineers: Cape Copper Works.

These included a 44-hour week,increases in pay and an improvement in general working conditions. The Directors havingrefused to grant this programme in full, or to submit the matter to arbitration by the Ministryof Labour, the result was a strike involving practically the whole of the employees.(b) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.Building and Allied Trades.Building Trade Operatives: Liverpool. Demands have been put forward on behalf of theLiverpool joiners, plumbers, bricksetters and slaters for an increase in the rate of pay from2s. to 2s. 6d. per hour, and a 44-hour week.

The negotiations on the National Programme for theseworkers are proceeding and the Sub-Committee of the Nationat Transport Workers&apos; Federationhas met a Sub-Committee of the employers, who have recently formed a National Council ofEmployers of Dock and Waterside Labour. Details cf the application were discussed at thismeeting, and a report of the proceedings is being circulated to the respective unions. A NationalConference of all the unions concerned will be called before a final settlement is arranged.Railwaymen (Northumberland). There is some trouble on the London and North WesternRailway at Northumberland owing to the fact that a man who worked during the strike hasbeen appointed inspector.
