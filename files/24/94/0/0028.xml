Military Secret. &apos; 1183 /7(V. ( jyb/)&apos;Om Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of Stale for India,&apos; t &apos; &apos; 20th November 1919.(Received 28th.)15698. Please refer to para. No. 3 of my telegram, Army Department, No. .11424,dated 21st August. Africli question and Khyber. Afridi jirga have now assembledand are pressing for an early announcement of our intentions. Chief Commissionerof the North-West Frontier Provinces reports that their attitude is restrained andrespectful, and genuine desire for settlement was evinced. Elders., however, aredoubtful of their power to control younger men, and, in order to regain control, areanxious to be able to announce lenient terms and reopen Government employment.They also expressed concern about the military occupation of the Khyber, but did notpress the question because they realise that we have not settled finally yet (? withomitted) Afghanistan. Present reasonable attitude of Afridis, of which it is desirableto take early advantage, together with the uncertainty of the present position in CentralAsia, makes it urgently necessary to complete such precautionary measures as we can.2. Our views, in which Grant concurs, are as follows: (a) In view of ourexperience in the recent Afghan war and possibility of complications arising out ofthe position in Central Asia, it is essential that we should hold the Khyber securely,which can only be done satisfactorily by military occupation by regular troops ; (6) I tofacilitate military occupation a railway is desirable, and to enable us to advancepromptly in case of war into Afghanistan it is, in the opinion of the Commander-in-Chief, essential ; (c) Afridis will not like either permanent military occupation orconstruction of railway, and we believe the best course will be to continue theoccupation and ultimately to construct railway without asking their consent.3. As to the military occupation we have instructed Grant to inform the Afridisthat it will continue, and we can hold out no promises to them of its termination. Asto the railway, if they force the question, as they may do, seeing that railway surveyis patently in progress, Grant will tell them no decision has been yet reached. Wewill address (? you omitted) further on the subject of the railway, but until we havecleared up the situation in Waziristan we do not propose to come to a final decision.4. Grant hopes to be able to make immediately settlement with Afridis for pastoffences on fairly lenient terms, which will include a promise of employment to Afridisin Frontier Corps, and perhaps in tribal Levy Corps in their own country, for whichscheme is under consideration. We must, however, face the possibility that continuedpresence of our troops, together with the uncertainty regarding our railway policy,may excite opposition which may take the form of extensive raids into neighbouringdistricts and perhaps desultory attack on our troops. All possible political steps will,however, be taken to win over leading men and reconcile tribes to action which wepropose and to obviate breach. Our military forces are, we consider, adequate fordealing with any situation that may arise.
