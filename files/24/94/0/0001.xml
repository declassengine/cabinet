t^&apos;. 7(MIS DOGUit&quot;:1ijT IS TH3 PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAI1HIO 1.^ J^STY&apos; S gOTOICTHT)..SB CR 2 H?.O.P.S01.0:ICABINS ToIRISH    FINANCENote on the Report of the Finance: SubrOpirgnittoe -&quot;by. the Chancellor of theH]xchequoT.TSee 0,P.190).I cannot pretend to have &quot;been able to give the timenecessary for a proper study of all the diffioult questionsraised, but in deference to Committeefs T/ish to have someindication of my views by this afternoon I submit the follow-ing observations :-&apos;I.PROPORTION OF IRISH CONTRIBUTION TO IMM SERVICES.The Committee give no indioatiori ofho^ they arriveat the suggested proportion of.l/40th.I dissent from the basis adopted in both memorandagiven as Appendices to the Report.    All Irishmen contend thatEngland, has foisted upon them a system of administration andrates of pay possibly suitable to a well-to-do country likeEngland but unnecessary and insupportably burdensome to apoor country like Ireland.   It is therefore impossible totake our present expenditure as representing what is necessaryand the margin between that and existing revenue as the amountavailable for Imperial Services,    Further, much which in Irelandis charged to the Central Government is paid in England outof rates.   No allowance la made for this in the calculation.On.the other hand it seeins to me absurd to suggest thatland and houses ought not to contribute say to defense.   Incase of war one does not appeal to a man to defend his stocksand shares or foreign investments, but to defend his hearth andhome.But mon will dispute for ever about taxable capacity andI know of no solution.   I do not quarrel therefore with theproportion of l/40th if a defence can be found for it which ismaintainable and not dangerous in other possible contingencies.II.I^TOTJI/   CHARGES.I assume that all^ Imperial Charges: not specificallymentioned are covered by tho &quot;&amp;o,T following Defence in paragraph2.I strongly support the Sub-Committeers view that- Irelandshould contribute to future defence as well as to existing deH.III.LOCAL     CHARGES.It would seem to me that in the event $f Local Parliaments .being established all purely local services must be transferredto them and the common Exchequer must net be asked to retain themost burdensome of them. For this reason the Housing Act should-,be repealed and tho Education Bill withdrawn if Home Rule isaccorded.
I should not, however, object in principle it a limitedfree grant or present to the Irish Parliaments to&apos;be used bythem for Housing if such was thought desirable on broad.groundsof policy,   But I suspect that it would not be popular in England*IV.LAND PURCHASE,I see strong reasons for treating the Land PurchaseAnnuities as part of the transferred Irish revenues, but nonefor treating tliem aa an addition to the generous provisionalready made. *Vo.CUSTOMS AND EXCISE,I agree with the Committee as to the retention of Customsand Excise though it must be noted that the Excise revenue willsuffer seriously if there is any laxity..-or ill-will on the partof.,the Irish Governments and of the police after it has beentransferred.INCOME TAX/Thei^e are grave objections to handingover Income Tax,including Super-tax,  (especially-.when our. own tax is and mustremain so high) to a country which is at our very doers.Owing to the fact that the rent of an Irish farm representsbut a small part of its annual value- the rest being tenantright - the Irish farmer escapes far more lightly than his Englishor Scottish competitor-.   This, however, does net for other reason.:;cause,the removal of English farmers, or English capital to Irelandbut my recollection is that it was clearly proved before theformer Cabinet Committees that under such a scheme of financg asis here proposed Ireland could easily afford to abolish allIncome and Super-tax in Ireland and would, be foolish not atleast to reduce it to something like l/5rd or l/4th of Britishrates,  . In this case there might be. a great efflux of capita   tothe detriment of British revenue and British industry.Have the Sub-Committee c-nsidered this point?It must be further observed that it would be impossible togive. Income Tax. to Scottish and English Parliaments and we shouldtherefore be establishing a system in Ireland which would placean additional obstacle in the path of general devolution.I suggest as a possible solution, requiring careful ex-amination before adoption, that the first shilling of Income Taxand the first shilling of Super-tax might be allocated to LocalParliaments - the whole tax being levied, collected and accountedfor by the Imperial authority-   I think that a practical schemecould be devised on this basis, coupled with the surrender ofthe Land Purchase Annuities,   Even in.this case the difficultyof distinguishing Irish Income would be very great.   I supposethat it could be done, but I am not sure.   At any rate it ^ouldbe
be important to have some indication of the conclusions of theRoyal Commission in regard to doable Income Tax beforedefinitely deciding. - I suggest that the Sub-Committee shouldconsult the Chairman, Lord Colft^itVile&apos;RE-ASSESSMENT OF IRISH CAPACITY TO CONTRIBUTETO IMPERIAL CHARGES.I see no reason  or an annual reassessment and it wouldbe most disturbing.   The assessment should be made not moreoften than once in five years and I should have thoughtpreferable once in ten*By whom   is this reassessment to be made? Before anyonecan &quot;re-assess&quot; he must know on what principle he is to proceed.The Sub-Committee provide no&apos;guidance on this point., It willnot be known why or how l/40th was fixed and the whole schememay be upset by going to one extreme or another of the possiblehypotheses.   Surely it is necessary to give some guidance asto the course to be adopted in the future or some explanationof the basis of the assessment now proposed. ...(Intd.)   A.C.1 reasury?
