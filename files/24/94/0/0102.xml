The proposal in G.T. 8353 to make the Food Ministry a permanency for aperiod of five years after the termination of the war is advocated by the FoodController on three grounds (a.) Continuity of policy.(b.) Continuity of staff.(c.) Anticipation that the control of food will be necessary in some degree for alonger period than six months after the termination of the war.2. It is apparently overlooked that the definite prolongation of the Food Ministryfor a period of five years will tend to perpetuate control even when the necessity for itdiminishes. It must not be forgotten that the public has a natural desire that theseministries or departments, such as the Food Ministry, which came into existence purelyto meet war emergencies, should not form part of the permanent organization ofGovernment. This desire is based partly upon the demand for retrenchment in publicexpenditure, and partly upon the unpopularity of control.3. In these circumstances, the definite prolongation for five years of the Ministrywould appear to be neither popular nor necessary.Assuming that some of the activities of the Ministry must be continued for acertain period longer, all requirements, and the three difficulties mentioned inparagraph 1, could apparently be met by the amalgamation of the Food Ministry withanother department existing before the war.The activities of the Ministry are in many points in contact with the Board ofTrade, and it is suggested that, as an alternative to the prolonging of the Ministry forfive years, a better course would be to arrange for it to be absorbed in the Board ofTrade, or, in other words, tor the Board of Trade to take over such activities of theFood Ministry as require to be continued.4. If this arrangement were adopted, the prospects of the staff at presentemployed by the Food Ministry would be sufficiently improved, and continuity ofpolicy, which it is hoped does not mean a claim for permanency, could be assured.5. The special interests of the War Department in regard to the general questionof food control would not appear to differ in any way from those of the general public.The interest of all is that there may be a general fall in prices.If the Ministry of Food were to become a permanency, a question might arise asto what should be the basis of charge for supplies sold by the Ministry to the WarDepartment. The only sound principle would appear to be that the Ministry of Foodshould not charge the War Department more than the price charged to the wholesaletrade supplying the public. If the War Department were charged more than thewholesale price, then Army Votes would be subsidizing the Ministry of Food (or theBoard of Trade if the Food Ministry were absorbed by the Board of Trade). If, onthe other hand, the Army were charged less, then it would mean that the generalpublic would be making a subvention to the War Department indirectly, instead ofthrough Army estimates, since the whole cost of the Ministry is obtained from theproceeds of their sale of food.6. This, however, is a question which it is premature to discuss, as it is hoped thatthe activities of the Ministry of Food will not need to be prolonged for any veryconsiderable period.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.13th December, 1919.1(B19/580)  90   12/19  H&amp;S  7S00wo
