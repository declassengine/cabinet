This Dopitment is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty^ Government.3----//      /PAJ^FBKAC&quot; fSLlGRiii from the Secretary of State forthe Colonies to the Governor General of the Commonweal&quot;of Australia,(Sent 10.10 p.m. 19th November, 1919)19th November.Your cypher telegrams received November 15th.Following message for ^our Prime Minister.   Begins -&quot;Mandates.    please refer to Prime kinister&apos;s messageto you October 15th in which he pointed out thatCouncil of League to which Mandates have to be sub-mitted cannot be constituted till formal ratification.This depends on deposit, which has not been foundpossible yet (see concluding words of Treaty).   It isnot our fault that owing to unfortunate action ofAmericans Senate constitution of Council of League ofNation, has been so long delayed and appears nowaltogether in jeopardy.    I am sincerely sorry for theembarrassment which the delay causes you, but I canassure you that to us too it is intolerably embarrassinin many ways, and that speaking for myself I have leftno stone unturned to put an end to it.    It seems tome just possible that in view of long vista ofuncertainty caused by American situation the fourother Principal Allied and Associated Fo-ers may beinduced to go ahead by themselves and issue Mandateswithout waiting for constitution of League leaving itto America to adhere if and when it suits her.   Thiswould not be altogether satisfactory but would bebetter than present position.    Any way as a lastresort I am trying it.   Will let you know at once ifeffort meets with any&apos; success.&quot;MILN2ri.
