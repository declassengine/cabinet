DgoOrient [3 ihn Property of J$His Dritannic Maje&apos;8ty&apos;3 Government* ... \J3 MINISTRY  OF   FOOD.Report for Month ending 15th November 1919.^Sdme of the difficulties incidental to the transitional period before decontrol canbe achieved have been apparent during the past month.In the case of meat, considerable cargoes of, frozen meat have been arriving fromAustralia and New Zealand, in addition to the large quantities of beef imported fromSouth America by the Board of Trade. Australasian shipments of mutton are swollenby the meat previously purchased but remaining in storage owing to the difficulties ofshipment. A serious situation arose owing to the lack of cold storage accom-modation, and the discharge of some vessels was delayed. Concurrently with thisretailers were raising objection to being required to take Australasian mutton at themaximum price, because of the loss incurred owing to the manner in which it had beencut. To meet the position it was necessary to reduce the retail price of importedmutton by 2d. per lb. on the 10th November, despite the dislocation which this means inthe financial basis of the meat scheme, and this reduction will ultimately be extendedto all imported meat. A further question which has become urgent is as to thedate of the decontrol of meat. Such a measure had been contemplated in the springor early summer, but in view of the circumstances indicated above and of thesupplies of home meat which are coming forward it would be desirable for manyreasons to effect decontrol at an earlier date. The difficulty in the way is the existenceof the guarantee to the British farmers, which is held to imply a reasonableexpectation of a market for their meat at the agreed prices. A conference washeld on Tuesday, the 18th November, with the Central Agricultural Advisory Councilto ascertain whether the farming interests would be willing to forego the guarantee,but the proposal to this effect was received with marked disfavour and consequentlyno decision has been arrived at with regard to an early date of decontrol.From an administrative point of view it would be of advantage to decontrol meat,milk, home butter and cheese, on the 31st March, but in view of the necessity toencourage home production this action cannot be taken without the assent of thefarmers.The general decision to free the export as well as the import trade fromrestrictions will cause a difficulty in respect of potatoes. The potato crop, though. good in quality, is somewhat short and the import of Irish potatoes is essential if thenormal supply is to be maintained throughout the coming year. The presentarrangement is that Irish growers can only export to foreign countries one ton ofpotatoes for every two tons shipped to Great Britain. There is already an increaseddemand on the continent for potatoes and it is clear that if all restrictions arewithdrawn and this arrangement can no longer be enforced, there may be a shortageof potatoes in this country with correspondingly higher prices. At present theprices here are higher than they should be owing to difficulties of transport, and thesedifficulties are aggravated by the demand in certain districts for high quality potatoesirrespective of price. For example, dealers are buying for Lancashire potatoes whichwould ordinarily serve the London market, notwithstanding that the transport of thesepotatoes may occupy trucks for six days. It will be necessary to obviate this by thedelimitation of zonal areas, such as formed part of last year&apos;s scheme of control.With regard to other commodities certain points of importance may be noted.The milk supply, owing in part to a more than normal autumn flush, and in part tothe higher prices, has been in excess of the demand in certain parts of the country..This has aggravated the general feeling of discontent and the Food Controllerreceived an important deputation from Food Control Committees asking for areduction of the maximum price. The basis on which the price was fixed was statedin detail, and it was explained that the price was a maximum price and not a fixedprice ; so far as the retail price was concerned it was pointed out again that the fullretail price is charged in a comparatively small number of Committee districts.A Committee was formed from among the delegates to examine the basis on whichthe prices was determined.One consequence of the surplus in milk has been an increase in home cheese,which will, it, is hoped, go some distance to offset the falling off in the supplies fromCanada, which are some 25,000 tons below the normal. On the other hand there is agood prospect of supplies from New Zealand, which, together with the home output,A will enable the Ministry to distribute from all sources during the period November1919 to May 1920, more ample supplies than were available in the same period lastA (33)9361 Pkl6 140 11/19 E&amp;S    - I
year. The butter ration, which was raised to 1\ oz. as from the 10th instant, will, itis feared, have to be reduced again to 1 oz. at a comparatively early date, owing toa failure in the supplies from some of the principal sources, namely, Australasia,Denmark, Holland, and the Argentine, and the objection of the Treasury to an increasein the purchases from Canada, one of the few remaining export countries,In respect of bacon, the Ministry&apos;s buying mission in the United States has madevery satisfactory arrangements with the packers, and prices in the American marketstand at a relatively low level. It should be possible to reduce prices both of bacon andlard in the New Year provided that the exchange does not fall further, A settlementhas been achieved with the owners of c.i.f. goods requisitioned, but as yet no agreementhas been arrived at in respect of consigned goods and it is possible that the packers&apos;claims will be submitted to arbitration.While the supply of fish has been good the prices have been maintained at toohigh a level and in viewT of this the Food Controller has found it necessary to re-imposemaximum prices for those fish which have been decontrolled under general licence.The Ministry has co-operated with the Board of Agriculture in the herring curingscheme promoted by the latter body but the whole question of fish suppliesand prices has to be examined. Railway difficulties appear to have an adverse effecton this commodity and it seems desirable that the pre-war system of conveying fishby wrater, wherever possible, from port to market should again be brought into *operation,With regard to the result of prosecutions it may be pointed out that during arecent week out of a total of 441 cases in Ireland, 434 were successful. The averagefine was 11.11s. Od.During October net imports of the principal foodstuffs into the United Kingdomwere generally satisfactory and fully maintained the stocks position in the country.Supplies of cereals and meat were large, and in the case of meat, stocks reached avery high figure, which is likely to rise still further. In view of the strain thus putupon the cold storage accommodation of the country, the smaller arrivals of baconand lard last month were not unwelcome, especially as they still left substantialquantities on hand in this country. Imports of butter and cheese showed someimprovement which did not, however, prevent a slight fall of stocks. Larger arrivalscombined with reduction of consumption have arrested the decrease of sugar stocks,which are now only about 60 per cent, of our stocks a year ago. The visible stocksposition as regard tea, coffee and cocoa remains good in spite of net exports of coffeeand cocoa ; but invisible stocks of tea in trade are understood to be still belownormal.During the five weeks ended 1st November, the consumption of butchers&apos; meat inGreat Britain showed a considerable rise, and the demand for rationed meats for thefirst time with the present ration quantity approached the quantity guaranteed by theMinistry. Four-fifths of the supplies were home grown, and this proportion would,have been higher but for interruptions arising from the outbreak of foot-and-mouthdisease, strikes of slaughtermen, and transport difficulties. During the same periodthe weekly quantity of flour passing into consumption also rose, being 105,200 tons asagainst 102,500 tons for September, figures which correspond closely to those of ayear ago.The statistics collected by the Ministry of Labour as on November 1st, show thatthe upward trend of retail food prices continued, the percentage increase on July 1914rising from 121 &quot;5 on October 1st to 131 &quot;4 on November 1st. The principal advanceswere in meat, both home and imported, which rose by 10 to 20 per cent, or on anaverage about 2d. per lb., and in milk where the rise of a penny in the maximumprice per quart appeared as an average increase of f d., bringing the price to lO^d.per quart. There was a further increase of l\d. per lb. in the price of tea, and theseasonal increase in eggs continued. The only decrease was the seasonal fall inpotatoes, which, however, leaves the price over 33 per cent, above that of a year ago.Regarding wholesale prices in October, home-grown cereals showed little altera-tion. Canadian bacon averaged 192s. per cwt. as compared with 193s, in September;the only other alteration in the provision group is tea, this continues to rise, Indian tearose from Is. b\d. to Is. l\d. per lb., and Ceylon from Is. 4d. to Is. $\d. per lb. Of theoilseeds, linseed rose from 740s. to 850s. per ton, cottonseed fluctuated somewhat,falling from 440s. to 410s. per ton, but finished up at 435s. per ton, and palm kernelsrose from 765s. to 780s. per ton. Oilseed cake movements were only slight, linseedfell from 500s. to 480s. per ton, cottonseed fell from 395s. to 390s. per ton andpalm kernels rose from 340s. to 355s. per ton, falling at the end of the month to 335s.per ton.   There was no movement in millers&apos; offals or in oatmeal.
