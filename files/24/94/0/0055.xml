.....2   This Document isJffiLEEBSSOL\/HaUTGTHE MEAT SITUATION.MEMORANDUM BY THE POOD CONTROLLER.CABINET 1 ^(1)    My officials are now assisting the Board of Agriculture inpreparing a scheme of decontrol, with compensation to British farmers,in lieu of the maximum prices which they have, with justice, regardedas guarantees. I should like to express my views on this matter beforethe scheme is considered by the Cabinet.(2)     I have hitherto assumed the Board of Trade figures to becorrect, although some doubt has arisen as to how far the arrivals ofAustralasian meat will be concentrated in this country as compared withthe whole of Europe. It is quite clear that there Is-a present glutfor which great difficulty will be found In affording relief. As con-trol in, general has, always proceeded on the assumption of actual orprospective shortage of supplies, I foresee a political demand forfreedom which it will be difficult for the Government to resist.(3)   On the other hand, I am not clear that de-control will mater-lally ease the situation so: far as the accumulations of Importedmutton and lamb are, concerned. It may well be that the removal ofregistration, which Is the only restriction of any moment, will stim-ulate consumption; but I see no prospect of consumption being stimu-Isted to the extent necessary for the riddance of surplus supplies;nor am I clear that it would be a good thing if consumption were stim-ulated to that extents For while there is an actual and prospectiveglut of meat, all my information goes to show that there may be someshortage In or about July, and a decided shortage after Christmas,1920. If It is considered, as it may well be, that this is looking toofar ahead, I can only say that the breaking up of our considerableorganisation, which has hitherto worked with success,,will beirrevocable and that it will be impossible to restore effective con*trol at short notice.(4)   Moreover, de-control involves difficulties&apos; of its own.   Themain obstacle is the guarantee to farmers^ and I agree with thePresident of the Board of Agriculture In thinking that they would notconsent to the withdrawal of this guarantee without money compensation,and that it would be plainly unfair to resist this demand.&apos;Conversely,the provision of a definite compensation fund for farmers is bound toexcite political obloquy, especially if It is necessary to obtainPar1lamentary sanction. It is true that in my opinion the loss to theExchequer will be less than that involved by the continuance of con-trol with the present differentiation; but while there are;financialadvantages in de-control, the political difficulties will have to bemet.(5)   Again, the -immediate benefit to the consumer will be doubtful^The price of the best home-killed meat will rise, but the price ofimported meat will not be lowered unless the Treasury are prepared tofaee an actual loss in respect of Australasian meat. The advantagesto the customer involved&apos;in the abolition of registration of consumerswill not be appreciated by the poorer classes.(6)   While I feel that de-control of meat may be regarded as apolitical necessity I. have felt bound to insist upon the fact that ithas disadvantages of its own, and to attempt to point out some ofthese disadvantages.GEO. H, ROBERTS.Ministry of Pood,December 4th 1919.
