Both the Admiralty and Mr,Churchillhave now consented to publication.     I submit, therefore, thatCabinet authority should now be given to the publication of thisvolume     If authorisation is given for the publication of thefirst volume of the Naval History I presume that the HistoricalSection will be justified in pushing on the other parts of theOfficial History as rapidly as possible, but of course eachvolume will be sent to the Department which it principally affects,as well as to Members of the Cabinet, before publication.(sgd)   M*P.A.Hcnl:ey.Copy of letter No,M.04380, dated November 25th, 1919 * fromthe Admiralty to&apos; the Secretary to the Cabinet.Sir,With reference to the discussions which have recentlytaken place as to the form in which the first volume ofSir Julian Corbetfs Naval History of the V*ar should appear,I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty tostate that a conclusion has been reached as regards the textof the
