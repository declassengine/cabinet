To the LORDS COMMISSIONERS OF HIS MAJESTY&apos;S TREASURY.My Lords, j1. This Committee was appointed by Your Lordships on the 31st October, .1919, toconsider the steps that should be taken by Local Authorities to facilitate the raising of capitalto defray the cost of housing schemes, and in particular to make suggestions for a model long-term security for this purpose.2. It has been represented to us that this question has now become a matter of extremeurgency. We have the honour, therefore, to submit an Interim Report embodying recom-mendations affecting the needs of the Local Authorities in Great Britain, reserving theconsideration of any modifications which may he necessary in the case of Ireland until alater date.3. It may he convenient if we recapitulate the circumstances which led to the formationof the Committee.4. Under the Housing, Town Planning, &amp;c, Act of 1919, the State undertook to providea considerable contribution towards housing in the form of subsidies; but, Laving regard tothe extent and difficult nature of its own loan operations, it looked to the energy and publicspirit of Local Authorities themselves to provide the initial capital necessary for the erectionof houses in the areas concerned, except in the case of the smaller Local Authorities who hadbeen accustomed to obtain loans from the Public Works Loans Board. For the purposes ofdelimitation it was decided that Local Authorities with a rateable value of over  200,000should not be financed from the Local Loans Fund.5. Many Local Authorities, unaccustomed to conduct loan operations upon a large scale,were proposing to obtain money for housing by means of short-dated loans; from bankers andothers from whom they had previously been able to obtain such, advances as they required.Your Lordships considered that this course was calculated to undo much of the good whichmight be anticipated from the process of funding the floating debt of the State, and, ifindulged in on a large scale, was in itself: certain to defeat its own. object, viz., the conversionof such loans in a few years&apos; time into long-term securities at more favourable rates of interestthan could now be obtained. The very fact that a large volume of short-dated indebtednesswas awaiting an opportunity for consolidation would in itself keep the terms for long-datedsecurities high. ,6. The figures placed before us by the Departments concerned as representing the costof carrying out their project to provide 535,000 houses within the next three years are neces-sarily only a rough estimate. The following table shows the approximate amount requiredin Great Britain, based on an estimated cost of  800 a house in England and  850 in Scotland.	England.		Scotland.&apos;	Period.

From September 1920 to September 1921... ,,    .    &apos;,,      1921 ,,        ,,     1922...	100,000 200,000 200,000    &apos;	  110,000,000 160,000,000 130,000,000	5,000 10,000 20,000	  4,250,000 8,500,000 17,000,000Total   ...     .........	500,000	 400,000,000	35,000	 29,750,000In each of the first two years provision is made for houses commenced but not completedin the period. Thei capital is divisible, roughly, as&apos; to half for Local Authorities over  200,000rateable value and half to Local Authorities under1 that figure. As the latter have the privilegeof obtaining loans from, the Local Loans Fund, it is primarily with the Local Authorities over 200,000 rateable value that we are concerned.7. We have examined as many witnesses as possible in the short time available, includingofficers of the Ministry of Health and of representative Local Authorities. It does not appear,except in a very few cases, that schemes have reached the point at which they are actuallyheld up for want of funds. Some Local Authorities have not yet completed their schemes,and in the majority of cases they are proposing to carry them out by stages, placing contractsat first for only a proportion of the total number of houses requiredi. On this basis they can,in many cases, see their way to provide sufficient money for the earliest stages of the schemes.8. We gather from the evidence of the representatives of the Ministry of Health thatthey feel confident that their scheme can be carried out in full in the times shown in the abovetable, but we have, on the other hand, found that some of our witnesses express doubts as tothe possibility of providing so large a number of houses in the period.(26324) Wt, 28646-1 8,100 11/19  H.

9. As regards finance, a number of Authorities have, as yet, not found it necessary toattempt to raise money in considerable sums, inasmuch as their housing schemes ore notsufficiently advanced. Moreover, there appears to be a natural tendency to await furtherdevelopments, more especially with the object of seeing if the State will undertake furtherobligations in the provision of money. In some cases advertisements have been inserted inlocal papers, and approaches have been made to banks, insurance companies and other financialinstitutions, without any appreciable results, but it was admitted that, generally speaking,only rates of interest below the present yield of Government Securities have been offered. Weshould add that witnesses, especially from less important areas, have urged the extreme diffi-culty of finding locally sums approaching the amounts which will ultimately be required fortheir housing schemes.10. We have considered the various methods by which Local Authorities have in the pastbeen able to provide for utility schemes and find that these fall into four groups: I (a) By the issue of stock in the market.(b) By mortgage loans from private individuals and companies for short periods.(c) By advances and short-term loans from bankers and others.(d) By State advances under various Acts through the Local Loans Fund.11. The method of raising money by mortgage loans is largely adopted in the industrialcentres of the North of England and in Scotland. These mortgage loans are usually forperiods of three, five or seven years, secured in general on the whole of the rates and revenuesof the borrowing authority. From the evidence before us it appears that very large sumshave been raised in this manner, almost invariably at rates lower than those yielded bycontemporary Government securities, and it has been common experience that about 70 percent, of such mortgage loans have in the past been renewed on maturity and could ordinarilybe regarded as almost permanent loans.12. As regards endeavours to increase to a material extent the sums obtainable in thisway by raising their rates of interest, practically all the representatives of Local Authoritieswhom we have seen expressed the desire, if it were possible, so to provide finance for housingpurposes as not to force them to raise the rate of interest on the renewal of their maturingmortgage loans to the level that would be necessary to attract the large sums required tofinance their housing schemes. They expressed the view that the resources of most of thelocalities were not yet exhausted.They pointed out that lenders attach much importance to the fact that such loans do notdepreciate from their face value and that they are secured on the credit of their own localities;there was agreement also that local investors often prefer a local municipal investment to aState guaranteed security. The witnesses agreed, however, that in view of the large necessitiesof the situation, some increase in the rate of interest could not generally be avoided.13. Complaints were frequent that those mortgage loans did not rank as a trustee invest-nient, although the stock (frequently much depreciated) issued by the same Authority carriedthis privilege, and evidence generally agreed that if this disability were removed substantiallylarger sums could be obtained.WE RECOMMEND, therefore, that these mortgage loans should be constituted a TrusteeSecurity in all cases in which the issuing Authority lias, under existing Acts, power to issueStock ranking as a Trustee Security.14. We are of opinion that many of the largest Local Authorities who are accustomedto satisfy their requirements by the issue of stock and by the- mortgage loans referred to hithe preceding paragraphs will continue for the time being to be able to finance their housingschemes in the same manner. Drawing as they do, not only from the investing nublic oftheir own locality, but from the general floating balances awaiting investment in the moneymarket, their credit is such as to command large subscriptions, if, having regard to preseitconditions, an adequate rate of interest is offered.WE RECOMMEND, therefore, that, apart from the issue of &quot;Local Bonds,&quot; which weare recommending later, the largest Authorities should continue their present system ofborrowing to provide the money required for housing.15. We have considered the possibility of Local Authorities borrowing abroad, and weunderstand that some Authorities have already been approached by representatives of Americanfinancial institutions. We think that this method of borrowing presents far-reaching advan-tages, and, provided money oan be obtained on reasonable terms, should be encouraged.WE RECOMMEND, therefore, that power should be taken to continue the PublicAuthorities and Bodies (Loans) Act, 1916, which enables Local Authorities to borrow abroad.16. The possibilities of co-operation between the smaller authorities in a &quot;Zone,&quot; withthe object of borrowing on the security of their joint rates, do not appear to have beenconsidered by any of the witnesses before us.WE RECOMMEND that, if practicable, Local Authorities should be empowered, subjectto&apos;the sanction of the Departments concerned, to combine for the purpose of issuing Bondson the lines hereafter laid down, on the security of their joint rates and revenues.
We also suggest that it should be considered whether County Councils could beempowered to raise money by the issue of &quot; Local Bonds &quot; or otherwise, and lend to LocalAuthorities for the smaller areas in the County for housing purposes.17. We cannot regard the present practice of obtaining large advances from bankersas suitable for the purposes under consideration, nor do we think that any large amount couldbe secured in this way..18. It has been suggested in the evidence we have heard that the State should shoulderthe whole burden of raising the capital required for housing schemes, in addition to itspresent liability in respect of subsidies. The chief argument, as stated in paragraph 12;is that Local Authorities fear the effect upon their existing loans of having to offer a rateof interest sufficiently high to attract the large sums now required. It is admitted, on theother hand, that the Government is now paying a higher rate for its money than the LocalAuthorities have up to the present found it necessary to offer.19. Having regard to the exceptional demands upon the State resulting from the recentwar, and the heavy funding operations with which it is faced, we are of opinion that theamount now required could not be raised by the State upon terms substantially easier thanthose upon which Local Authorities may be expected to borrow, and that the effect upon thecredit of the country would be very serious if the State were to enter the market for thepurpose of financing the whole of the housing scheme.20. We consider, therefore, that, as the State has already undertaken such heavy com-mitments in respect of the housing needs of the country, the onus of finding the necessarycapital should, as far as possible, remain on the Local Authorities. As we have alreadypointed out, we cannot see any insuperable difficulties in the way of the larger Authoritiesraising sufficient money for the earlier instalments of their schemes, and we think that withstrenuous efforts the smaller Authorities should also be able to find enough for that purposeby the adoption of the &quot;Local Bonds&quot; recommended in the following paragraph. We arefurther of opinion that, whenever conditions admit, Authorities under , 200,000 rateable valueshould endeavour to finance themselves without recourse to the Local Loans Fund.21. On the question of a model security for housing purposes, while we should prefer torecommend the issue of a long-term security, we are of opinion, after the evidence we haveheard, that money can best be attracted at present by the offer of short-term securities.WE RECOMMEND, therefore, that Local Authorities he empowered to issue &apos; 5i percent. &quot;Local Bonds &quot;for 5, 10 and 20 years on the lines laid down in the Appendix to &apos;&apos;thisReport. The issue of these Bonds should he restricted to Authorities who hare obtained- thesanction of the comipet-e-nt Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government.22. It has been brought to our notice that the raising of small sums from lenders ofmoderate means would be greatly facilitated if it were possible to pay interest without deductionof Income Tax and leave any liability to tax for direct assessment, There is little doubt thatthe payment in full of War Loan dividends through the Post Office has added considerablyto the popularity of this form of investment of small sums, and we are of opinion that if theconcession is extended to the interest on the proposed &quot; Local Bonds &quot; a large number of smallsums will be attracted which would otherwise be invested elsewhere.WE RECOMMEND, therefore, that, in the case of small holders of Bonds, interest should,he paid without deduction of Income Tax at the source; and although, in view of the enquiriesnow being held by a Royal Commission, we hesitate to name\ a limit, toe are strongly of opinidnthat the concession should apply to any holder of. Bonds up to an aggregate of , 500.23. We are further of opinion that the popularity of the Bonds, both with LocalAuthorities and the investing public, would be increased if the Bonds themselves were free ofStamp Duty and Authorities were empowered to compound with the Inland Revenue Authoritiesfor payment of Stamp Duty on transfer, so that the Bonds may be transferred free of expense.The composition fees would represent a negligible addition to the cost of the housing scheme.24. We also consider that, in view of the conditions which we suggest should be attachedto the issue of the Bonds, they might clearly be constituted a Trustee security.25. There appears to- be a considerable body of opinion among Local Authorities that ifthe proposed Bonds were readily accepted as cash at their face value, with accrued interest, inpayment of the purchase price of houses sold by Local Authorities, their popularity withworking-class people would be still further increased, and we recommend that power shouldbe taken to enable this to be done with the least possible formality.26. Our recommendations, so far as they concern the model security, are made with theview of meeting the immediate necessities of the scheme, and they should be subject to revisionat a later date.27. We desire to emphasise our view that every effort should be made to obtain moneyby subscriptions from the particular classes which will most benefit by the whole housingscheme, and we recommend that an active campaign should be instituted throughout thecountry with the object of securing the widest possible support of investors of all classes. Themerits of the Bonds as an investment of savings, and the great advantages of the improvedhousing accommodation in their own locality, should be impressed on the residents of each
housing district, as well as the necessity of their subscribing to the Bonds, if the requisitehouses are to be erected. The restriction upon output which is caused by the lack of accommoda-tion for employees in commercial undertakings which are desirous of employing larger staffsshould be explained, and such, firms should be urged to interest themselves in the local housingschemes. Every effort should be made to induce each district to provide- the money necessaryto carry out its own schemes; in tins way a healthy rivalry might be awakened. If the suggestedissue of &quot;Local Bonds&quot; for housing is to appeal to the investing public and secure adequatefunds, it is, in the opinion of the Committee, essential that the Departments concerned shouldbe in a position to satisfy the public that every possible effort is being made to preventprofiteering in any form in connection with the provision of the houses.28.
