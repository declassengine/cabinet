FUTURE OF NATIONAL KITCHENS &amp; OF I/.ILK CONTROL.I-&apos;EfciORAHDUH BY THE MINISTER OF HEALTH, M.H.10.This ^rrunent is the Property of-:hy.&apos;.Mti:;    G j comment.I desire to set out briefly fcr the consideration cftho Cabinet My views with regard to the proposed transfer tothe Ministry cf Health of the Food Controller:s responsibilityfor National Kitchens referred to at the end of his memorandumCP,146 of the 16th November, 19190I am well aware of the value which National Kitchenshave been shown to possess under war conditions, but I dcubtwhether it is desirable to settle the permanent policy to beadopted with regard to them until a further trial has been givento the scheme under Peace conditions;   I arn of opinion, therefore,that so long as the Ministry cf Food continuos to exist, tho        ;\responsibility for the administration of National Kitchens,(Yihothor at present carried on by local authorities or maintaineddirectly by tho Central Department), ought to remain with thatMinistry, which possesses tho requisite knowlodgo and experienceIn regard to them acquired during the war period and I gatherthat this is also the view of the Food Controller *     I think thattho question of the transfer of tho powers of the Food Controllerin this matter to any other Minister should be deferred until theprobable life of the Ministry of Food is more definitely known.With regard to milk, the control of this commodityIs at the present time in the hands cf the Ministry cfHealth in so far as hygienic quality and purity are concerned.The control of supplies and distribution is exercised by theFood Controller, and should, in my opinion, continue to beso exercised, so long as the present situation is unchanged.The/
The lines of the future policy with regard to thecontrol of milk were settled by the i*/ar Cabinet at ameeting on 20th June, 1919 (Minute 582) and a Committeeis at present considering the measures necessary to giveeffect to this policy,     It was contemplated that thedegree of control to be exercised in the interests ofpublic health should he, considerably extended, and thatthe new functions (subject, to concurrence of the Boardof Agriculture in the necessary Regulations) should beexercised by my Department.C.
