This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.3 ^vtpJytt-;&amp;\C,9, - A^jJ / THE CABINET.M. TCHAYKOVSKY AND RUSSIAN POLICY.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate a note which represents the views of M. Tchaykovsky on RussianPolicy.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.1st December, 1919.It is quite true, as Mr. Lloyd George says, Bolshevism cannot be vanquished andPeace restored by armed force alone.In order to accomplish this, two things must first be attained, viz. : (1.) An effective and well-equipped Russian army must be*restored, capable ofdealing a succession of decisive blows to the Bolshevist (mixed withGerman) forces.. (2.) A united and strong democratic power must be recreated, enjoying theconfidence of the population and capable of guaranteeing them a realalthough may be limited freedom.To attain the first (an effective and fully equipped army) we must have, under thecircumstances, the friendly co-operation of the Allied (as against German) Powers inthree ways, a, b and c : (a.) Material help, simultaneous and concentrated by supplying us with warmaterials, clothing, food and finances.These we have received in driblets, in more.or less insufficient amounts,enabling us, so far to struggle against Bolshevism, but not to vanquish it.(6.) Moved help, by recognizing, immediately the Democratic Anti-BolshevistGovernment of Admiral Koltchak, as the legal National Government forthe whole of Russia.Without this recognition neither the army nor the State organizationcan be duly disciplined and consolidated, lacking a central moral authority(the convocation of a Constituent Assembly being impossible while the- country is in a state of civil war),(c.) Political support by not interfering and confusing our efforts to preserveintact our territories and to secure the vital interests of our Russianpopulation in toto and not in separate provinces.In both these respects the Allied Powers have not only failed to assist us, buthave taken grievious steps to dismember and divide the United Russia. Underpretext of the liberation of small nationalities from their former dependence to theRussian Empire, a most dangerous Separatist movement has been set going among thesmall nations, in the hottest moment of civil war with the anarchist Soviet power(which is backed by Germany). In consequence of this the nationalistic forces wereset at cross purposes with these forces fighting the international Bolshevist danger.The pernicious results are only too evident as in the Baltic provinces; theNorth-West Army of Yudenitch is disabled and the Baltic small nations, being ontheir own, are forced to open negotiations with Bolshevist leaders in order to,escapethe double danger of the German forces on the one hand, and the Bolshevist forces onthe other.   Similar complications are in Ukrainia and the Caucasus.In this way the ill-timed separatism and the now-condemnation of separatism bythe Allies has caused weakening and failure of the forces, both of the Mother Country(B19/552)   90   12/19&quot; B&amp;s  774 7wo
and of the prematurely born offspring, followed by the colossal waste of the materialhelp rendered by the Allied Powers in the campaign against Bolshevist Petrograd.And still two things (Recognition and Political help) are being refused us up tothe present moment for various reasons, i.e. First. For lack of certainty as to which side up the coin avouM fall (Bolshevistor Koltchak).Second. Doubt of the amount of true democratic spirit in our military commanders.Third. The temporary reverses in the military operations of our armies.Fourth. Mr. Lloyd George quotes (18th November in House of Commons) LordBeaconsfield: &quot; I regard a great, gigantic, colossal growing Russia, rolling onwards like aglacier towards Persia and the borders of Afghanistan and India, as the greatestmenace the British Empire could be confronted with.&quot;Whatever the reasons, the fact remains, glaringly remains, our hands are still tiedby Non-Recognition.Poland, Finland, Czecho-Slovachia are all recognized-we are not recognized. Thisfact alone prevents us from using our own fighting, as well as financial, constructive andorganizing, forces to their full extent. (Germany holds millions of our money under thepretext that there is no recognized Russian Government to whom to deliver it; Rumaniaholds large stocks of our arms for the same reason.)2. In order to attain the second thing (a strong democractic power, indispensablefor vanquishing the Bolshevists and establishing peace in Russia) the Civil Governmentof the parts liberated from the Bolshevist horrors should be formed of public workersenjoying the confidence of the population; and, moreover, that the predominatingmilitary authorities (Commanclers-in-Chiefs and their subordinate staffs) should notinterfere with the management of civil affairs by introducing therein the methods andusages of battlefields and barracks.Unfortunately both these drawbacks are in evidence in Siberia as well as in SouthRussia, and the results are most deplorable.To sum up, four things are needed from the Allies to assist Peace in Russia.(i.) Admiral Koltchak&apos;s Government to be recognized by the Allies at the earliestopportunity (so many opportunities having been lost in the past) as the solelegal Government for the whole of Russia.(ii.) Material and financial help to continue.(hi.) Discountenancing the Separatist movements among the small nations and,indeed, efforts at a temporary rapprochement with the Mother Countryto be attempted instead of the ill attempts at peace negotiations with theBolshevists or with the Germans.(iv.) An influential Allied or British statesman to be commissioned to AdmiralKoltcbak and General Denikin to suggest and to support the suggestion ofadequate reforms.19th November, 1919.
