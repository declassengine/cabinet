This Documen-t. is wtHis DrItann! .b2!22SLemorandum by theTresidjnt of the iward of Trade.i   iwmmns in gmlny.2,3.I am anxious to have the opinion of the  Cabinet onthe question of what the attitude of the Government shouldbe to the purchase- by British subjects of controlling sharesin businesses in Germany..Tho user of some of our oaports to secure not presentimports, but future imports spread over a number of yearsis involved.- The sterling credits paid for the shares wouldbe drawn against to pay for German imports, and would haveto be made good by means of eisports.   The quid pro quo wouldtake the form of imports representing our participation inany profits from the investments.   So far as this furnishingof credit is involved,   I should argue that it is worthwhilo bearing a heavy strain for a time if as a resultlasting and substantial gains can be secured.. Moreover, ithas to be romembored, that, so far as the sterling creditsare useu to obtain commodities which the Reparation Commissiowould otherwise have to allow Germany to purchase asnecessaries, the amounts immediately duo from Germany oilaccount of the indemnity would be pro tanto increased.&apos;The following advantages would attach to the purchaseby British subjects of controlling shares in businesses inGermany:-(i)   The recovery of Germany would be hastened by suchinvestments and we should thereforo benefit, both directlythrough tho dividends received, and indirectly through thegreater ability on the part of Germany to pay tho indemnity.
This &quot;being so, it couldbojmintain^J^jigainsi&apos; the   -popular aversion to resuming intercourse with Germany,that it was a method of increasing Germany&apos;s capacityto meet her obligations to tho Allies.(i&apos;i) This country wmild also secure Gvontu&amp;l benefitthrough the improved prospects opened up by the tradorecovery of so important, a market for British goods,(iii) If we do not step in there is a risk that Americamay acquire a dominating position in those industriesin which it would.be preferablo to secure Britishcontrol,   German undertakings under British Control&apos;are loss likely to come into damaging conflict withbusinesses horetlian German undertakings under Germanor American Control,(iv) It may be argued that there are also advantagesconnected with trade with Russia.   It may be expectedthat in the not distant future the economic penetrationof Bissia from the side of Germany will assume consider-able dimensions, and-Groat Britain would share inthis penetration in so far as British Capitalists werein control.Against these advantages must be set the followingdisadvantages;- -(i) Public sentiment in this Country would&apos; ho opposed,at any rate at first, to investment of British Capitalin German undertakings^(ii) The effect might be merely to porpotuato andstrengthen German goodwill in Bissia rather thai, tosubstitute British goodwill.   It is arguable also thatwe should have more scope in Rissia if the recovery of ;Germany were not facilitated by British assistance,
(iii) Shore is some danger of developing in Germany withBritish capital industries which we should prefer to seedeveloped in this oountrv-,If anything&apos; is to be dene on the lines indies ted itshould be done at once.    The present happens to be anextremely favourable moment,    America is inquiring but netyet actively moving, and it is reported that German firmsin their eagerness to get British support are prepared tooffer highly attractive terms.The question to settle is what the attitude of theBritish Government should be,(a) Should it raise objections to projects ofthis, kind,(b) Or should it adopt/non-commital attitude, sayingno more than that it has no objections to raise?(c) Or should it go the length of declaring that ifcapitalists are satisfied with regard to generalsecurity (as to which the Government can of coursegive no guarantees), the projects in question wouldbe in the National interests?
