CONFIDENTIALC. P. 264..      .,,/A, CABINET.GERMAN EXPANSION IN THE.EAST.(Extracts from General Ludendcrff* s War Memories)*Note by trie Secretary.It is thought that the following extracts from GeneralLudendorffls War Memories may be of &quot;Interest to the Cabinetas throwing light on German ambitions in the Baltic States :-p.p.178 &quot;At the close of the great operations-.... conditionsjand 179. In the territory we had occupied in the course ofevents had to be re-organised1.-.... we went to Kovnb at theend of Cotober^&quot;.... my mind was flooded with overwhelminghistorical memories.     I determined.to resume in theoccupied territory that work of civilisation at which theGermans had laboured in those lands for many centuries.The population, made up as it is of such a mixture ofraces, has never produced a culture of its own and, leftto itself, would succumb to Polish domination.     I wasproud to think that over a hundred years ago, after aperiod of great weakness and tribulation In Germany, wehad thrown off the foreign yoke.     Now that same Germany,first beaten by Napoleon because she was decadent andsubsequently united by the efforts of a few great men,stood victorious in this wwrld-war .... a happy futureof assured prosperity seemed to be opening out for theFatherland.&quot;p,206. &quot;The German love of order and knowledge of hygienecarried the day.     A peasant earned more than hehad done under the Russians.     In the towns businesswas revived .... we felt that we were working forGermany1s future, even In a strange land.     We especiallyhoped to open a field for German colonists In QoMrl&amp;nd.&quot;p.443. &quot;The Austro-Polish resolution&apos;entailed grave dangersfor Prussia and Germany .... and was a direct threatto our Eastern Provinces .... our communications withEast Prussia, Lithuania and Courland would be threatened.. The annexation of these.two districts wa3 at thattime by no means a fantastic dream.&quot;(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)*
J!;After the war I wanted to bring up a contented&apos;generation, capable of self defence.   In the BalticLittoral I wanted to create a large settlement area forsoldiers and fcr a large number of Germans who wereexpected :to re-emigrate from Russia,.   The vast un-Inhabited and un-tilled areas In those parts providedroom for German &quot;settlements without crowding cut theInhabitants,,.&quot;&quot;The Piaid Marshal and I considered /that theterritory administered by the -Commander-in-Chief in theEast should ultimately be divided into, a Duchy ofCourland and   a Grand Duchy of Lithuania ..., both shouldbe in closest relationship to Germany and united inthe personal sovereignty of His Majesty .... in this weknew Germany would gain a military defence against furthersurprise attacks by Russia and also land fcr the &apos;settle-ment of our troops after the War&quot;.&quot;On the 30th April a general agreement was,reachedto the effect that in the whole of the territory underthe Commander-in-Chief in the Sast. our action was W bebased cn the following principles: everything Germanwas. to receive favourable treatment9 but even themerest appearance, of forcible German!sation, of whichI had never approved, was to be avoided.   The word&quot;Germanise&quot; has always been&apos;abhorrent to me.   TheLithuanians were to be won over by ail possible meansand the white Ruthenes in the Northern di strict to bebrought more in touch with them.    In consideration ofthe Poles, the latter object was not to be pursued inthe S^uth .... The general conditions made it more-andmore imperative clearly t.o define our intentions in theEastern territories.   The catch words &quot;Peace without- Annexation&quot; and &quot;self-determination of small Nations&quot;,which had &quot;Been invented by hostile propaganda, were&quot;&quot;likely to lead to a solution&apos;of the Lithuanian problem,which wrvalfl be detrimental to German interest .... v. enthe 21st July, GoHcQ. approached the Foreign Office wntha proposal to pursue a policy of local nationalisationin Courlahd and Lithuania.&quot;Courland an ^Lithuania would improve our feedsupply in case we should in a future war have to relyence more on-our own resources .... the inhabitants ofCourland and Lithuania were to bring Germany additionalman-power .... the German settlements which we hopedwould take place on a ^reat scale .... would in thefuture provide further increase,&quot;&apos;&apos;vThe intended conference of questions, relating to. the territory under the Commander-in-Chief In the Easttook place on the 4th .:vvV as before, our&apos;policy ....aimed at -joining Courland ad Lithuania to Germany bymeans of a personal union, under the House of Hohenzollern.... .In Courland most of the work:was already dbne;nothing remained, but formalities .... Then it was IntendedIn both countries to prepare the main outlines of theinternal constitution, as well a3 for the military,economic and political union flL th Germany.
t. t a  o ...  ,l   o t(l554 and.  &quot;Eastern questions wore again discussed at length535.        In order .to determine&apos;tho peace conditions to bepro sen tod to Russia *.,, vtho Imperial Chancellor agreedwith tho idea of establishing tho personal union ofCourland and Lithuania with Prussia or Germany providedthe fodoral princes agreed,,   . His Majesty approved thisopinion and insisted on the necessity of allowing thenations of other races which might be included todevelop according - to their&apos;own character.     As regardsour policy towards tho people of Courland and Lithuania,this- involved safeguarding the results&apos;we had securedhitherto, unless wo wished to see fresh dangers ariseon- our Eastern frontier in the futureP    Regarding&apos; Esthonia and.Livonia, Hia Majesty aeoided to proposewithout demanding, their evacuation by the Russiansso as to allow the &apos;5sthonians and Letts to exercisethelr right of - self-de termination^ *561 o . . - - &quot;In condert&quot;with our -/allies and in agreement withG.H.Q. the Government. demanded,-,for our military securityend also in ^compliance. with -the right of self-determination; that Russia should recognise the indopend-enoe of Finland &apos;and Ukraine, end give up Courland,Lithuania, Poland, Batum and Eer-Se    The future positionof  atbonia and Livonia was not yet settled; for thepresent they wore to be occupied by us&quot;*56S.       &quot;The conditions -of tho Peace of Brest, ^Lithuaniaand Courland .are not of vital importance to Russ^ar.,c . aI therefore &quot;supported in all sincerity the formation ofa Baltic Littoral&quot;.661,       &quot;I steadily furthered ny pot scheme of settlingthe isolated Germans /scattered throughout Russia, sideby side with our soldiers, in the lias torn districts......Ssthonia and&apos; Livonia were with Courland united into onemilitary Governmental district, the Baltic Littoral.Lithuania had-retained its former frontiers.   I proposedto extend to Livonia and ISstlionia a policy which hadhit her W been employed in Courland.
