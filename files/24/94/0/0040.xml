SAVINKOV AND RUSSIAN POLICY.MEMORANDUM BY&quot; THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate for the information of my colleagues a paper on Russian Policy,which I understand represents M. SavinkoVs views. &apos; ...WINSTON S. CHURCHILL. -27th November, 1919.M. Savinkov&apos;s Opinion on the Situation in Russia and on the Necessity for aNew Direction in Eussian Policy.   .1. The situation on the various Russian fronts at the end of the first fortnight inNovember is undoubtedly most serious.In the east Admiral Koltchak is retiring, Omsk is about to fall into the hands ofthe Bolsheviks, and the Siberian Army may be considered as non-effective for many-months; perhaps Koltchak&apos;s Government will itself fall to-morrow. In any case theAdmirafs authority is no longer effective, for the authority which he did possess wasbased on his power a power which to-day is broken, and seems to be on the point ofdisappearing.On the north-western front General Judenitch&apos;s adventure is terminating, asmight have been foreseen, in a defeat. The Esthonians and Lithuanians are going toresume their negotiations with the Bolsheviks, and as far as Finland is concerned,according to the opinion of General Mannerbeim himself, the Finns are not at alldesirous of taking any military action which they at the present time have toundertake practically alone.In the south Denikin is beginning to retire. In the regions re-conquered by himinsurrections are breaking out and the Bolsheviks are reinforcing their army which isopposed to him by troops withdrawn from the north-west and from Siberia. TheVolunteer Army cannot hope to reach Moscow this year.Thus the plan of campaign for this year has failed.2. What are the reasons for this failure ?The reasons must be sought, first of all, in the false conceptions of the politicalsituation conceptions which have moulded the military policy.In order to regenerate Russia, Admiral Koltchak, General Denikin and M. Sazonovconsidered that they had only to use the services of the Great Russians and the:Cossacks. It is with these elements alone that they have carried on the struggle.They have wittingly refused to co-operate with the other peoples of the former Empire Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbeidjan, White Russia, the Baltic Provinces, Finland andPoland in all some 97 million inhabitants who could have furnished most valuableassistance. V   \These leaders are indifferent to, and uninfluenced by, the new ideas of freedom&apos;which have changed the face of Europe, and have been deceived as to the aspirationsof these non-Russian peoples.   Admiral Koltchak himself has been too far off to realize,,the exact political situation.   General Denikin and Sazonov have persisted in the lineof policy dictated by outworn formulas.   Their secret desire has been to reconstitutea Great Eussia; that is to say, a centralized Constitutional Monarchy.   They havepushed away all the claims, even those which are most legitimate.   They have found &apos;their suspicions met with hostility wherever they have endeavoured to secureassistance. , /To-day the Baltic Provinces are unfriendly, Georgia and the Ukraine hostile, andFinland suspicious. The Poles, whose independence has been grudgingly recognized,remain silent and unresponsive.This is the situation. ....
To believe that in these conditions the straggle against Bolshevism can be crownedby victory is an illusion.3. What, then, is to be done ?The whole line of policy must be radically changed.The present position of isolation and suspicion must be changed for one ofconciliation, understanding and co-operation&apos;with all the peoples of the former EussianEmpire, for whom it is as important as for the Great Eussians and the Cossacks todestroy Bolshevism.In order to attain this end, it is essential To define the conception of the Russia of tomorrow a huge federated Republic onthe American system, in which the various component States will enjoy the largestautonomy and all local liberties.Esthonia, Latvia and the Ukraine must be brought to adhere to this programme *as, without these provinces, Russia cannot exist.The independence of Poland and Finland t must be fully recognized without anyreserves and without waiting for the decisions of the Peace Conference, which may bedeferred for a very long time.The territorial claims of Poland and Finland should be examined in the mostsympathetic spirit.It is in taking the above-mentioned considerations as constituting a political basisthat a common plan of military co-operation can be elaborated a military action inwhich all the non-Russian peoples of the border States would co-operate.4. This general programme must be rapidly established and carried out.The Allies are suffering from the disastrous effects of Bolshevik propaganda. Ifthe vacillating policy which is at present being adopted is persisted in, it is to be fearedthat negotiations will be opened up with the Bolsheviks and some compromisearrived at.JAn immediate action must therefore be taken in order that decisive militaryco-operation may become effective next spring.How can the political problem stated above&apos; be solved ?By convincing Admiral Koltchak 1This cannot be thought of-the Admiral is too far off, he cannot realize the exactsituation and he refers practically everything to Denikin, who at present represents thereal directing power.Pressure must therefore be brought to bear on Denikin.But Denikin, faithful to his ideas and supported by a reactionary Government anda reactionary staff, will be extremely difficult to convince.How can sufficient pressure be brought to bear on him to make him change his lineof policy ?The Americans, who are unwilling to take an active interest in Russian affairs,and the French, whose situation is very difficult in South Russia, cannot do this.Only the English have sufficient power, for the Volunteer Army would cease toexist if British aid were withdrawn from it.The British Government should, therefore, without ioss of time, send to Denikin apersonage of weight with the mission to ask the General to change his line of conduct,and if necessary, to impose upon him a new line of conduct.Denikin would &quot;naturally be obliged to make radical changes in the composition ofhis Government, and he would be obliged to replace M. Sazonov by someone moreactive, more abreast of modern ideas, and capable of inspiring confidence both by hispolicy and his political past in the non-Russian peoples, whose close collaboration it isdesired.The principle of M. Savinkov&apos;s contention appears to be incontrovertible.It is obvious that the essential condition for success in the struggle against theEolsheviks consists in the union of the efforts of all anti-Bolshevik Russia, thenon-Eussian countries formerly part of the Russian Empire, and the immediateneighbours of Russia.* The Mensheviks (Kerensky&apos;s party) want a centralized Republic, the idea of which f lightens the BalticStates. These States would, however, according to M. Savinkov, accept a federative Republic on the basisof complete local autonomy.f A recent telegram from Admiral Koltchak refused to recognize the independence of Finland until theRussian Constituent Assembly has voted on the subject.\ An emissary of LeniD has just arrived in Paris with peace proposals which he is submitting to theUnified Socialists. According to these conditions the Bolsheviks consent to the summoning of a ConstituentAssembly (Savinkov). &apos;
It is also plain that such a co-operation can only be obtained if the guarantees forthe future demanded by these countries are accorded or solemnly guaranteed.It is therefore necessary to admit the necessity for a radical change in the politicalorientation and in the methods of military action so that the necessary accords may beconcluded for the creation and consolidation of an anti-Bolshevik Union, the organizationof the forces of such Union, and a decision as to their employment in a general and&quot;decisive action.Tn the present circumstances there is no doubt that a carefully chosen Britishrepresentative would be more likely to succeed than anyone else in inducing Denikin toaccept this new programme.It would seem, however, that the authority of this agent would be greatlyreinforced if he were the representative, not only of England, but of the principalAllied and Associated Powers. In other words, the person sent to General Denikinshould have powers delegated to him by the Supreme Council.It would seem that the moment has come for the Supreme Council to seek to solvethe Russian problem in a resolute fashion, and to state frankly in what conditions theAllied and Associated Powers intend to continue their moral, material and financialassistance to anti-Bolshevik Russia. .Bolshevism is a world-wide danger.Permanent peace is impossible until Bolshevism disappears and until a stableGovernment is restored in Russia a democratic Government such as is claimed by theGreat Russians, guaranteeing to the non-Great Russian populations their autonomyand local liberty, conceding to Poland and Finland full and entire sovereignindependence, and effectively dissipating any suspicions which might legitimately beraised by the reconstitution of a centralized and aggressive Russian State.Such a programme of liberal policy is one which is in every way in accord withthe principles of the Treaty of Peace.The Supreme Council should give definition and approbation to such a policy.If such approbation is given the task of political reconciliation between GreatRussia and the non-Great Russian countries, Finland and Poland, can be undertakenand the necessary co-operation found for the realization of a concerted attack againstBolshevism which, if successful, will break the power of Bolsheviks and Bolshevikagitators throughout the world.18th November, 1919.
