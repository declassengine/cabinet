MIS D0CK1u\flI IS TH&quot;! PROPERTY OP HIS MlTAHTIC &apos;&quot;ACPSSTYS, SOVT^OTT.FOURTH REPORT,(Previous Reports * CP. %t Q.P. 137 and CP. 190)The Committee are, now in a position to make theirfinal recommendations in regard to Bill X.I.They have decided to recommend a modification of thearrangements which it is proposed to bring into operationbetween the date of the coming into force of the Act and the. -TJnion of Ireland.    They were impressed &quot;by the objection thatnot enough powers had been conferred at the outset upon thetwo Parliaments, and they, therefore, recommend a large increasein the powers conferred upon them at the outset.   They were alsoimpressed by the objection that it would upset and dislocateIrish life and administration if Government Pepartnents couldbe bandied about &quot;between various authorities one by one and atdifferent times, and irrespective of taxing powers for a numberof years.    They thought it necessary that the scheme shouldhave more definiteness and finality about it if it was to beworkable in the early stages.     They, therefore, decided torecommend that there should be only two stages between the cominginto operation of the Act and Irish Union instead of three asthey originally contemplated.     The modified scheme&apos;which theynow propose is as follows :-(a)     That, on the appointed day there,should be transferredto the Parliaments of Korth Ireland and South Ireland al3, thepowers provided for in the Draft Bill X, and in additionthe following powers which, in the Braftwere reserved to theTOY SECBST.CABIE3T.C.

The Ministryof Health are being consulted on the subject.(b) That the revenue of these two Parliaments should boderived from(l) Local Taxation for 1919 *-  2,790,000,(2) A transferred sum equal to the difference betweenthe product of..local, taxation and the cost oflocal services at the date of the passage of thoAct,   for 19.I9 -  8,437,000.(3) A sum equal to the annuities payable under the LandPurchase Act.    2,990,000 rising to  5,500,000.(c) That, during this&apos; phase no attempt should be made toassess Ireland&apos;s contribution to Imperial Services, the UnitedKingdom Exchequer retaining all the balances from the taxes itkeeps in its own hands,&apos; namely customs, excise, and&apos;income tax,after paying over the transferred sum to the Irish Parliaments.It is further proposed that if the yield of the taxes retained inImperial hands increasesr there should be a triennial examinationof the object on which this additional revenue is spent, and ifit is spent on Great&apos; British as opposed to Imperial purposes,there should bo a proportionate increase of the transferred sum..(d) That,, at any time the two Parliaments may transfer tothe control of the Council of Ireland any or all of these servicesInasmuch as the appointed day will probably be not earlier than   -fifteen months from the passage of the Act, this will give the
two Parliaments arrola tine to consider the disadvantages oftho complete separation of all Irish services and to makearrangements with the Council of Ireland &quot;before a divisioncomes into automatic operation,(e) That, the following powers should he retained in thehands of the Imperial Government hut should he transferableen bloc to the control of an Irish Parliament as soon as such a&quot;body is constituted, to take the place of the Council of Ireland.(l)   Post Office, both internal and external but notincluding wireleas and cables.

Debt, &quot;Var Pensions, andTefence should he &quot;based upon her capacity to pay, ascertainedthen and revised thereafter every five years, customs andexcise heing retained as security for this contribution.II.The Sub-Committee also make th* following recommendations onpoints which have not yet been settled(a) Representation in Imperial Parliament.They recommend that representation in the ImperialParliament should be in proportion to population which shouldgive Ireland about 63 or 64 members.(b) In and Out Clause.They recommend the retention of the Clause as drafted.
