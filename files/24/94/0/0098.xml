[This Document ta the Pgopgrfty of His- Rritattnic Majastys Government]Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1919. 3 Si 5SECEET. , .      .......C.P.-294. &apos;CABINET,Report on the Thirty-first Meeting of the Supreme Economic Council held atRome on the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd November, 1919.THE British Government was represented at the meetings by The Food Controller,The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,together with officials from the Treasury, the Board of Trade, the Foreign Office, theMinistry of Food, and the Ministry of Shipping.The French and Italian Governments were similarly represented by three or moreMinisters and officials, but owing to the General Election the Belgian Governmentwas represented only by officials.The more important resolutions passed by the Council are set out in the attachedAppendix.In addition, views were exchanged either in the Council or in separate confer-ences on a considerable number of other questions.The attention of the Cabinet is specially drawn to the following points :-1. In regard to the question of the future of the Supreme Economic Council andof its relation to the League of Nations, which was discussed at the Cabinet on the18th November, the following resolution was passed : &quot;The Supreme Economic Council, after discussion of its future and itsrelation to the League of Nations, considers any definite decision to be prema-ture, and gives instructions to its Permanent Committee in London to keep inclose touch with, the League of Nations for the purpose of studying from everyrelevant standpoint the relations between the Council and the League, and remitsall decisions to a future meeting, fixed provisionally for the beginning of Januaryin Paris.&quot;The French, Italian, and Belgian representatives strongly expressed the viewthat, whatever might be the final attitude of America, consultation and co-operationin regard to economic matters between the responsible Ministers of the Allied Powerswas of great value and should be continued. They were of opinion, however, that anew situation would be created either by the coming into existence of the League ofNations or by the readjustment of world relations which would follow any definitedecision by America to remain outside the League. They were, however, anxious thatthe existing Allied machinery should not be scrapped until the future was more clear.The British Delegates expressed the views agreed by the Cabinet on the 18thNovember, and in accordance therewith approved the resolution set out above.A statement was made to the Council on behalf of the Secretariat of the Leagueof Nations, from which it appeared that, apart from any new duties which may ariseout of decisions at the first meeting of the Assembly of the League, periodical meetingsof Ministers primarily concerned will apparently be necessary to carry out theeconomic functions which already fall to be performed by the League. ,&apos;2. The Council passed a resolution drawing attention to the extreme danger, botheconomically and politically, of the tragic situation from the point of view of foodand employment of Austria, Armenia, and certain other parts of Europe, and urgedthat since the provision of the necessary finance for relief and reconstruction appeared[1749] B
to be beyond the powers of the Governments represented, efforts should at once bemade to consider the possibility of international action.The proposal as to the provision of an international credit is in accordance withthe views which the Chancellor of the Exchequer desired us to express. We werestrongly impressed by the seriousness of, the ^situation, particularly in Austria, andby the apparent inability of any existing body to deal with it. The reportedunwillingness of the Americans to give further assistance causes grave additionaldifficulty. It is clearly unreasonable that the United Kingdom should be loaded withthe burden, but we are disposed to think the time has now arrived when, in the generalinterests of humanity and in order to preserve the peace of Europe, we should takethe initiative by endeavouring to secure the co-operation and material assistance ofthe neutrals as well as of the Americans in dealing with the credit, currency, andexchange difficulties of Europe.. 3-. It was agreed to continue Inter-Allied co-operation in the purchase of food-stuffs until August, subject to the right of notice in respect of particular commodities.This does not involve any liability for the provision of finance or tonnage on the partof the British Government. The prevention of competition in the purchase of foodis of material value to Great Britain, which is, of course, the most dependent of theAllied countries on purchases from overseas.4. Information was asked by the French and Italian Ministers concerning theprice and quantity of British coal available for export to the Continent during this, winter. In reply a full explanation was given of the British situation and the diffi-culties of the British Government in respect of coal, which appeared to remove someof the misapprehensions under which the Allies laboured. The Allied Ministersdesired that as much publicity as possible should be given to these explanations inorder to remove the suspicion and disaffection among their manufacturers and othersdue to a mistaken impression as to the attitude and action of the British Government,which, they stated, was having a bad political effect.5. We desire to recommend that with a view to securing proper and timelyexamination, from the British point of view, of the questions dealt with in para-graphs 1 and 2 above the Cabinet Committee of the Ministers primarily concerned,proposed in paper C.P.-40 submitted by the Secretary of the Cabinet on the 18thNovember, 1919, should be at once set up.(Signed)        G.

APPENDIX.SUMMARY OP PROCEEDINGS.I. General.(a.) The Execution of the Treaty. &apos;  -&quot;The Supreme Economic Council thinks it its duty to draw the attention ofthe Supreme Council&apos;to the ever-increasing danger to the economic situation of allthe Allied countries arising out of the delay in the exchange or ratifications of theTreaty of Peace.&quot;(b.) Relations of the Supreme Economic Council with the League of Nations andthe Reparation Commission. *&quot; The Supreme Economic Council after discussion of its future and itsrelations with the League of Nations considers any definite decision to be premature,and gives instructions to its Permanent Committee in London to keep in close touchwith the League of Nations for the purpose of studying from every relevant stand-point the relations between the Council and the League, and remits all decisions toa future meeting, fixed provisionally for the beginning of January in Paris.&quot;II. Exchange situation in Europe.(a.) &quot;In view of the extreme urgency of solving the exchange problem, andpending a more complete solution through international co-operation, it is necessaryfor the moment to treat the question as one between the Allied countries. EachDelegation shall draw up a report for its own Government on the financial situationas it has been presented in the present discussion, and shall before December 20thsubmit to the Permanent Committee of the Council practical proposals for asatisfactory solution of the problem, or at least for a substantial improvement in0the situation.&quot;(b.) Supplies to Austria.The following resolution was, on the proposal of the Prench Delegation, adoptedfor transmission to the.Supreme Council: &quot;The Supreme Economic Council has noted the decision of the SupremeCouncil of the Allies of the 15th November, entrusting to the OrganisationCommittee of the Reparation Commission the task of studying the problem ofthe supply of food and raw materials to Austria.&quot; The Supreme Economic Council, which formerly was able by means ofa credit granted by Great Britain, Prance and Italy, with the assistance of theUnited States, to relieve to some extent the Austrian situation, possesses atthe moment neither the powers nor the resources necessary to afford anyeffective assistance. It can therefore only most earnestly direct the attention ofthe Supreme Council to the extreme necessity of obtaining some solutioncalculated to remedy a tragic situation, the prolongation of which is fraughtwith danger to the security of all the civilised nations of the world.&quot;The Supreme Economic Council has noted the declarations of theBritish, French and Italian Treasuries, setting out the impossibility ofincreasing the financial commitments of the nations which have been exhaustedby the war.&quot; In any case, the Council considers that the necessary resources should be, furnished not only by the Governments represented on the Supreme EconomicCouncil, but by the Governments of all other nations.  It suggests that stepsshould at once be taken to consider the possibility of international action onthese lines.&quot;&apos;(c.) Situation in Armenia.It was agreed to transmit the following resolution to the Supreme Council: &quot; The Supreme Economic Council, having made careful note of therepresentations of Earl Curzon in regard to the present unhappy conditions[1749J B 2
prevailing among the Armenians, desires to place on record its sympathy withthe Armenians, and to express its regret that it has no resources from whichthe relief of Armenian necessities could be effected. The Supreme EconomicCouncil is of the opinion that the relief of Armenian distress is, as in the caseof Austria, a matter of concern not alone of the Powers represented on theSupreme Economic Council, but of all the civilised peoples of the world.&quot;III. Transport and Communications.(a.) Delivery to the Allies of Eleven.German Tank Steamers. -The Council noted a decision of the Supreme Council that of the eleven Germantank steamers under orders to proceed to the Firth of Forth, the nine steamersclaimed by the American interests should be retained in the Firth of Forth withoutbeing used pending a new decision by the Supreme Council.In view of the existing coal situation in Europe it was agreed to submit thefollowing resolution to the Supreme Council: &quot; The Supreme Economic Council having noted the decision of the SupremeCouncil (H.D 94/1), and particularly paragraph 5 (in which the United Statesrepresentative had agreed to call the attention of his Government to the urgentpetrol requirements of France and Italy), expresses the conviction that, in viewof the situation of coal and of general production in the whole world it isnecessary that German tank steamers should not remain unused, and asksthat immediate measures may be taken to use these steamers for the transportof oils, which would contribute to some extent in relieving the needs of thecountries which lack coal.&quot;(b.) Traffic on the Danube.It was agreed that every effort should be made during the winter months toprepare for a substantial improvement in the movement on the River Danube inthe spring.(c.) Traffic Conditions in Central Europe.The Council approved the formation of a provisional organisation forfacilitating the exchange of waggons across the frontiers of Central Europe, anddirected the Communications Section to take necessary action.(dj) Improvement of Postal, Telegraphic and Telephonic communications, throughoutEurope.The Couiicil resolved that it was essential for the more rapid re-establishmentof economic intercourse that postal, telegraphic and telephonic communicationsshould be improved up to at least their pre-war efficiency with the least possibledelay, and ihx fOr this purpose a formal conference of the technical officersconcerned from each country in Europe should be at once convened. It charged theCommunications Section with the duty of convening such a Conference.IV-Food.(a.) Consultative Food Committee.The Council approved the report of the Committee&apos;s work, especially the estab-liishment and working of the Sub-Committees forWheat and flour. Meat.

Expert of Grain from South Russia.The Council, taking into consideration the fact that in order that as a conditionof acquiring all or some of the grain surplus in the parts of Russia occupied by
General Denikin it would be necessary to give General Denikin a general mandatethat if and when he obtained possession of Petrograd and Moscow the fact that hehad allowed export of grain from South Russia should not be allowed to prejudicehis efforts to feed the population of these towns, agreed to submit the followingresolution to the Supreme Council: &quot; The Supreme Economic Council, being anxious as soon as possible toplace at the common disposal the surplus food supplies of South Russia withdue regard to the local requirements of that district, expresses to the SupremeCouncil the necessity of taking into consideration the question of food reliefof the populations of Petrograd and Moscow, whenever these towns may beaccessible.&quot;(d.) The establishment of an International Scientific Food Commission.The Council agreed that the question of the creation of such a Commissionshould be referred to the Council of the League of Nations with a recommendationthat in some form or another the physiological enquiries undertaken during the warby the Inter-Allied Scientific Food Comission should, in the interests of Europe asa whole, be continued on an international basis.V. Raw Materials.(a.) Supply of Raw Materials to Europe.On the subject of the export prices of British coal, the British Delegationhaving pointed out (a.) That there was no question of &quot;discrimination&quot; in British export pricepolicy, save in so far as it had been in favour of France and Italy; and(b.) That the British Government was not contemplating any change of policy.It was arranged that the statements of the British Delegation should be handedto the French Government for publication.(b.) Coal Supplies to Italy.After a discussion in which the Italian Delegation acknowledged the helpalready given to their country by Great Britain in respect of coal supplies, it wasagreed that a conference should be held as soon as possible between the technicalexperts of Great Britain, France, and Italy to discuss the proposed changes in thelicensing system.(c.) Future functions of the Raw Materials Committee.The Council agreed to the reconstruction of the existing Raw Materials Com-mittee as a Committee on Raw Materials and Statistical Information, charged withthe duty of collecting and publishing statistical and other information concerningnot only the supply of raw materials, but also the various controls and importanteconomic facts, and directed that the new Committee should work in co-operationwith Economic Section of the Secretariat of the League of Nations. .Inter Alia.German Exports to Turkey.After discussion of the question whether the Council should recommend to theSupreme Council that Article 23 of the Armistice with Turkey (prohibiting Turkeyfrom commercial relations with the Central Powers) should now be overridden, itwas agreed: &quot; That (in view of the fact that both the Financial and Economic Commis-sion were already dealing with Clause 23) the Council should take no jointaction in the matter, it being understood that the French Delegation wouldcommunicate with their High Commissioner in Constantinople about this andother similar questions arising out of the Turkish Armistice Conditions.&quot;At the invitation of the French Delegation it was provisionally decided thatthe Council should meet in Paris about the 10th January, 1920.
