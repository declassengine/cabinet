iii. C. LONGWURST.ft y *This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.SECRET.THE CABINET.GOVEENMENT MOTOR OARS,MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.The proposals contained in W.C. M  (9) (see G.T. 8381) as regards the WarDepartment would mean in effect the practical suppression of the mechanical transportsection of the military forces in the United Kingdom, so far as motor cars areconcerned, and the meeting of military requirements from a civilian pool under theMinistry of Transport.2. The proposed arrangement as regards the War Department would neither beeconomical to the State nor administratively sound. It would further tend to handicapseriously the efficiency of the military forces both at home and abroad.3. The three arguments which are put forward in favour of the arrangement haveno application to the military forces.(i.) Separate reserves either of cars or spares are not kept for each Command orfor the War Office requirements in London. The reserves of cars andspares which are kept are fixed for the military forces as a whole, both inthe United Kingdom and abroad, including the War Office requirements.It will be seen, therefore, that the requirements of the whole of thefighting services both abroad and in the United Kingdom form a single*   pool for this purpose,(ii.) Standardization both of cars and spares is carried out on a wide general basis,covering the requirements of the forces as a whole and keeping in viewthe types which experience has shown are adapted for war service.Thus, pressure in one Command can be met by cars from anotherCommand, and pressure at the War Office or in Commands met similarlyby transfer.The cars being standardized, whenever the transfer is made, the localsupply of spare parts can be used to deal with breakdowns.This applies also in a lesser degree to supply of cars and spares toforeign Commands, replacements being made from the common pool,(iii.) The regulations applying to use of all military transport, including motor cars,are uniform at the War Office, in Commands and abroad. Adequatecomparison between different Commands and the War Office can and areconstantly made and the arrangements for inspection are universal and no, exceptions are made.The branch administering mechanical transport at the War Office cantreat this question as a whole,(iv.) Finally, it is difficult to compare the requirements of the War Office andprobably any other Service Department with those of a civilian department.The character and the incidence of the emergencies are different, and theincidence of emergency renders it doubtful if any comparison of value ispossible. It is submitted that the only sound method is to make the ArmyCouncil responsible that in the conditions with which they have to deal&apos; every economy is observed.4. But it is from the point of view of personnel that the proposed arrangementwould be particularly disastrous.    At present the whole of the mechanical transport(B19/520)  90 12/19  H&amp;S 7690wo
personnel of the Army forms a general pool from which requirements at home and abroadare met. Thus lack of personnel for the War Office requirements can be met by per-sonnel from Command and vice versa. Requirements for abroad, including India, canbe met by transfer of personnel from home; men employed on lorries can be transferredto cars and vice versa. Under the proposed scheme, this elasticity would disappear.Cars for military requirements in the United Kingdom would be driven by civilians aridcars for military requirements abroad&apos; by military personnel. Thus all militarymechanical transport personnel would be confined to service abroad, at any rate so faras cars are concerned. This arrangement would inflict a serious hardship on the men,particularly on married soldiers.5. Again, the personnel for the military requirements, both at the War Office andin Commands, being military, is immediately available for war service, and can be usedto bridge over the first phase of war until it is replenished by special recruitment. Itsorganization is complete and no preliminary training is necessary. Under the proposedscheme, this personnel would disappear or be replaced by civilians, and in case ofemergency there would be no mechanical transport men available for motor cars to gowith the first set of troops.6. The gist of the whole problem may be summed up in the fact that the WarOffice pool and the military mechanical transport, including cars in the United Kingdom,is just as much an integral portion of the military forces as was the horse transportwhich it has largely replaced. It would be as reasonable to take the tugs pinnaces andsmall naval craft at home ports away from the Navy and place these under theMinistry of Transport merely because the Ministry of Transport employ such craftin connection with dock work as to merge the military cars under civilian control inthe manner proposed.Similarly the War Office is not analogous to a civilian department. It is anintegral portion of the Army and the duties which fall upon officers at ths War Office,and, therefore, upon the cars which they use, are of the same character as those whichfall upon other military personnel in the United Kingdom.7. The military cars are used for conveying officers on military duty sometimes inordinary routine such as visits of inspection but frequently on emergency duty as whenowing to difficulties, the presence of an officer from the War Office or Commands isrequired at the earliest possible moment.The Staff of the War Office and Commands is constantly being reduced to theminimum as conditions alter but this has only been possible by making use of such timesaving facilities of the present day as motor transport affords. It would be falseeconomy so to restrict the use of cars that more officers must be employed to cope withessential work.This is particularly the case with the Army whose motor cars are necessary to meetemergencies which are of the essence of normal military duty.8. In the case of the War Office, cars are frequently required at short notice inconnection with embarkation and disembarkation of troops in the neighbourhood ofLondon, surprise visits to depots and installations, visits to barracks, &amp;c, and visits toCommands and Educational Institutions, &amp;c.In the case of Commands, they are required for inspections, supervision of training,visits to depots, and the innumerable emergency calls which are of the essence of normalmilitary routine.If a requisition on a civilian department were necessary in each case, it is notconsidered that these requirements could be adequately met.9. One illustration of this point may be noticed. Except in Ireland, which is on awar footing, there are three allotted cars in Commands, one to the General OfficerCommanding, one to the Major-General or Brigadier-General, General Staff, and one tothe Major-General or Brigadier-General in charge of Administration and similarlycertain instructional establishments have a car allotted to the Commandant, in additionto a small pool.This does not mean that allotted cars are not used by other officers in Commands.Nor does the arrangement increase the total number of cars required for the Command.If the cars were merged in the Command pool, the number of cars required would bethe same. Nor does the arrangement involve any increased cost to the State. Thecars are administered as part of the cars of the Command and from the point ofview of expense the position is exactly the same as if they were merged in theCommand pool.The reason of the allotment is that from experience it has been found that aGeneral Officer of a Command would be bound as a matter of sound organization to

Once the cardinal fact of the character of the duties is recognized, it becomesclear that, aparc from the considerations noted above, the substitution of civilian formilitary personnel would be neither economical nor administratively desirable.(a.) If driven by civilians, innumerable difficulties would arise where the cars haveto pass sentries or go into camps or store dep6ts where civilians areexcluded.(b.) With military drivers, where the cars have to remain in use late at night, orbe kept over the night, it is possible to make adequate arrangements inparks or camps where there are other soldiers. From a disciplinary andpractical point of view, it would be impossible to make the samearrangements for civilians.(c.) It is in the main impossible to confine the hours during which the cars areemployed to those usual in civilian employ. Where the drivers are soldiersand the occupants are soldiers, no difficulty arises and the duty isunderstood and not objected to by the driver. If the drivers were civilians,difficulties would immediately arise, and at the same time, the samearrangements could not be made for the driver and then the hardship uponhim would be rendered considerably greater.(d.) Where the cars have to remain away from the home garage for the night,arrangements can be made by placing them in normal local dep6ts or campswithout increased expense to the State. For disciplinary reasons it wouldbe impossible to place the cars driven by civilians in these depots wheresoldiers were working, and thus the proposed arrangement would materiallyincrease the cost to the State.(e.) If the drivers were civilians, in the case of emergency duty and long hours,overtime would have to be paid. Where the drivers are soldiers as atpresent and the occupants are soldiers, the driver neither receives norexpects overtime, and regards such work as part of his ordinary duty.11. It is essential in dealing with this question to remember that the War Officepool, and the Command pool of cars form only a comparatively small element in thelarger mechanical transport organization of the Army.In commands for instance, the drivers of cars are housed in the mechanicaltransport camps and barracks, and repairs to cars are carried out in the Commandworkshops.This applies equally to the War Office pool cars which are dealt with in theLondon Command.Were the drivers of these cars civilians, this arrangement would be impossible.Separate accommodation would have to be found at considerable expense, and insteadof the formation of large units for car purposes, the result would be to create a smallcivilian unit within the military area.The retention of the War Office pool as part of the Mechanical Transport Forces,and of the mechanical transport in Commands, is therefore an economical arrangementin the interest of the State, and is, on financial grounds, preferable to the arrangementsproposed.12. In the circumstances it is regarded as essential that the existing basis oforganization in regard to motor cars for the War Office pool, and for Commands, shouldbe rel ained, and that the fighting services, including the War Office requirements,should be excluded from the merging arrangement under the Ministry of Transport.13. The conditions enumerated above are identical in the case of the Air Force,and it is essential that the present basis of organization should be retained in the caseof the Air Force for the same reasons, and that the Air Force should be similarlyexcluded from the merging scheme under the Ministry of Transport.WINSTON S. CHUECHILL.
