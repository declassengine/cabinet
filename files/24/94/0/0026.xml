[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]CONFIDENTIAL. C, &quot; *.....&apos;       WDraft Instructions for Mr. Mackinder.Sir,Foreign Office, November 1910.1 HAVE to inform you that His Majesty&apos;s Government desire you to proceed tcSouth Russia in the capacity of British political representative at the headquarters ofGeneral Denikin, and have accordingly appointed you British High Commissioner forthat purpose.You are already familiar with the Russian situation on general lines, but theparticular nature of your mission clearly requires that I should draw your specialattention to those elements in a notoriously complex, and temporarily insoluble,problem, with which it will be your immediate concern to deal.In the first place you will be proceeding to an area where at the present momentthe prospects of the armies in conflict with the Soviet power are not the mostfavourable. The element of surprise, however, is always present in Russian militaryoperations, conducted as they are over such vast distances and in territories offluctuating political allegiance, and there is therefore no reason to conclude that thewheel of fortune has finally turned in favour of the Bolshevist armies and against theiropponents; or that the military situation, such as we are witnessing, to-day, will not besubject at any moment to a complete and unexpected transformation.Nevertheless, for the immediate purpose of your mission, it is only possible toassess the conditions in South Russia as they are being actually reported, and you willhave, in all probability, to deal on arrival with a receding force.The failure of General Denikin to pursue his offensive to a victorious finish, andthe simultaneous set-back in the fortunes of the North-West Russian and the Siberianarmies, will have inevitably produced a feeling of depression among the Russian leaderswith whom you will be called on to confer, if not a certain resentment against theAllied Powers for having failed to support them to a greater extent than they havedone. It is doubtless with this state of feeling that you will immediately have tocontend, and it will be one of your first duties to explain the attitude of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, as regards the extent and the limits of support that it has been possiblefor them to give.The contributions which His Majesty&apos;s Government have made to the Russian forcesin North and South Russia have already been made public, and I need not thereforereiterate the published statement. The present object of these contributions is also wellknown. It was fully set forth in the Allied letter to Admiral Koltchak, a copy of whichis attached.With this end in view, it has been the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government tosupport General Denikin as the only force in South Russia likely to bring about thecreation of a stable Russian Government. General Denikin himself has recognisedthe authority of Admiral Koltchak, and may be described as the commander of theEuropean wing of the latter&apos;s army.The burden which has been thrown on Great Britain and her Allies by a five years&apos;world war has, however, been so vast that, vital though the establishment of constitu-tional government in Russia has seemed to them, their resources are clearly notinexhaustible, and a term has therefore had to be set to the period during which thesupply of war-material to General Denikin can be continued. As you are aware, thefinal contribution to him has now been fixed, and after the 31st March next HisMajesty&apos;s Government will not be in a position to give further material aid.I cannot believe that General Denikin will fail to comprehend the reasons for thisdecision or to realise that Great Britain, despite her great position in the world, isunable to assume commitments of an indefinite kind, but in view of his partialisolation from Western Europe it is possible that he is not fully alive to the reasons forthe decision. It may accordingly be necessary for you to elucidate them more fully, andto assure him that the decision in no way implies u withdrawal of sympathy, and that;he can continue to count not merely on the moral support of His Majesty&apos;s Government,but on such expert advice and guidance as he may care to seek on all political,administrative, and economic questions.[1549] B
It is chiefly to give this moral support and advice that you are proceeding oh yourpresent mission, and it is the political arena which will provide the main scope foraction on your part.General Denikin, deprived of further material assistance from abroad, is likely tobe thrown back on the efforts to secure by political means the assistance, or at least todisarm the hostility, of elements in the former Russian Empire, both Russian andnon-Russian, which at the present moment are confronted with their own problems forthe future, and may easily through mutual misunderstandings defeat both the ends ofthe national Russians and their own. The policy of both Admiral Koltchak and GeneralDenikin, which is directed to the reconstruction of Russia, has, in fact, already broughtthem at different points into sharp collision with the nationalist aspirations of both theex-Russian border States and the Russian groups with whom they have come incontact.The main problems of. this nature are General Denikins relationship with theTranscaucasian Republics, on the one hand, and with the Baltic States on the other.The aspirations of both these groups of States is towards complete independence,while it has hitherto been the avowed policy of Admiral Koltchak and General Denikin- to regard them as an integral part of Russia. The utmost concession which the Russianleaders have been prepared to make is contained in the reply which was sent by theAdmiral to the Allied letter already referred to (copy also attached).As General Denikin&apos;s relationship with the Transcaucasian Republics is of immediatepractical importance to him, owing to their proximity and the assistance they canrender him, or the reverse, in his military operations, I will deal briefly with it first.The dividing lines as at present fixed between. General Denikin s area and that ofthe Transcaucasian Republics of Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, starts on the BlackSea at the mouth of the Bzyb river and along its right bank to where it intersects theKuban-Sukhum frontier, and thence along the southern frontiers of the Kuban andTerek provinces to a place where the Terek frontier intersects the Daghestan frontier, andthen along the southern frontier of Daghestan to the Caspian Sea.It is with the national aspirations of the various peoples living south of this linethat His Majesty&apos;s Government are largely concerned. While in no way desirous ofunduly prejudicing the structure of the future Russian State, they are bound to admitthat the claim of these peoples to a national existence of their own is a strong one,though in what form this claim should eventually be given expression is a matterwhich cannot be adjudicated by His Majesty&apos;s Government alone, but must be left tothe decision of the Peace Conference or the League of Nations sitting in sequel to it.There are, however, certain definite actions of General Denikin in his relationswith the Caucasian States which are open to criticism. The chief of these is theblockade of Georgia, which he is now conducting from the Black Sea, a proceedingwhich is a matter of considerable concern to His Majesty&apos;s Government, inasmuch as itaffects not merely; Georgia, but the British-occupied province of Batoum and Azerbaijan.It is, moreover, apprehended that he may interpret the part which his fleet is playingin the Caspian as entitling him to occupy Baku. He should clearly understand that,in handing over to him the Russian fleet, His Majesty&apos;s Government intended him toemploy it only in his operations against the Soviet forces while respecting in everysense the integrity of the Caucasus. You will have, in fact, to insist on his observanceof the line of demarcation above referred to, and to remind him that continued supportof him within the limit with which you are familiar is dependent upon the faithfulfulfilment of his obligations in this respect.It is so evidently to General Denikins own interest not to alienate thesecommunities that you should endeavour to persuade him to adopt as conciliatory anattitude as possible in his relations with them, if he is to gain their assistance in hisstruggle against Bolshevism.With this end in view you should keep in close touch with Mr. Wardrop, who, asChief British Commissioner at Tiflis, is responsible for the relations of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment with the three Transcaucasian Republics. Mr. Wardrop is representingHis Majesty&apos;s Government in a sphere which comprises Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia,and (temporarily, at least) the province of Batoum, and while he will remain entirelyoutside your jurisdiction, you will,, as occasion requires, detach General Keyes to act asyour intermediary with him, in order to secure a constant exchange of views.I would also mention in this connection that Colonel Haskell, an American officer^has been appointed Allied High Commissioner for Armenia (including both Trans-caucasian and Turkish Armenia) by the Supreme Council in Paris, but it is understoodthat his functions will be mainly connected with relief work, and will not clash withthose of Mr. Wardrop.
The situation with regard to the Baltic States is in practice less complicated as faras General Denikin&apos;s military operations are concerned, owing largely to their geographicalposition, but the political attitude adopted towards them by both Admiral Koltchak and^ General Denikin is none the less uncompromising.The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards these States has been the pro-visional recognition of their Governments as de facto independent bodies of theEsthonian Government in May 1918, of the Latvian in November 1918, and of theLithuanian in September 1919. On the 25th September of this year His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were obliged for reasons given above to decline a request from all threeGovernments for a recognition of the independence de jure of the countries whichthey represented, but they accompanied their refusal with an assurance that, when thequestion of the status of these countries came up for consideration by either thePeace Conference or the League of Nations, they would exert such influence as theycould to secure the satisfaction of the legitimate aspirations of Esthonia, Latvia,and Lithuania, as far as might be consistent with a final and peaceful settlement inNorth-East Europe.You will observe therefore from this sketch that while His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;are unable at this stage to formulate a definite policy as regards the ex-RussianStates, they are anxious to meet as far as possible their desire for a separate nationalexistence to the extent that interests more comprehensive than those of any individualState or community permit.The position of Bessarabia creates a slightly different problem. But here againGeneral Denikins progress has been retarded by the attitude of the RoumanianGovernment, who continue to support the Ukrainian forces so long as he refuses torecognise Roumanias right to Bessarabia. It is hoped, however, that a solutionmay be found before long, seeing that Denikin and the Roumanian Government haveagreed to negotiate the matter.The so-called Ukrainian Government, which with its forces under GeneralPetlura has been driven to the western border of South Russia, claims to be therepresentative of the people of South Russia. The chief strength of its position lies,not so much in Russia, as in a vigorous propaganda campaign in foreign countries.It is generally believed that the so-called Ukrainian Government does not commandmuch popular support, a conclusion which is borne out by the rapid success of theVolunteer Army in the territory which the Ukrainians claimed as strongly Nationalist.General Denikin has therefore always treated the Ukrainian Government as hostile toUnited Russia.I have enumerated the main political problems with which Denikin is confronted,and which, as you will observe, cover a large field. There will no doubt be a variety ofother questions of a kindred nature whicli will arise while you are in South Russia.It will therefore be necessary for you to watch the political developments withgreat care, and to refer to me whenever it appears to you that some new issue hasarisen which must be considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the light of theirgeneral Russian policy, or when General Denikin seeks j7our advice on matters of first-rate importance.But in general your advice should be directed to persuading him to adopt a policyconsonant with the trend of Western democratic opinion, and to insist that peace inEastern Europe, even at the expense of certain deep-rooted theories and cherishedtraditions, will be more valuable to Russia and the world at large than a strugglecontinued for any other purpose than the establishment of order and ConstitutionalGovernment.Finally, I would bring to your notice the question of the alleged pogroms of Jewswhich is at present attracting much public attention in this country. The reportsreceived by this Department have so far been few and vague in character, and it hastherefore been impossible to give an adequate answer to the questions raised either inParliament or by the various Jewish societies in this country. Moreover, the militarymission at Taganrog has already been instructed to exercise a restraining influence onthe councils of the Volunteer Army where any question concerning Jews may arise.You should, however, do all in your power to protect Jews and to prevent excesses, andyou should explain that incidents of this nature create the worst possible impression *inWestern countries. As&apos; there is considerable doubt as to the truth of stories whichreach this country, I should be glad to receive a report on the whole question as soonas you have time to examine the problem.You will not be actually accredited to General Denikin, as the Government ofwhich he is the military chief in South Russia is not recognised by His Majesty&apos;s
Government, but you should maintain close relations with him and with his Government.In this connection I would remind you that, although this Government has received norecognition from His Majesty&apos;s Government, either us a de facto or a de jureGovernment, it has nevertheless, as you are aware, received their generous andconsistent support in the form both of funds and supplies.As High Commissioner you will be the chief political representative of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in South Russia, while Major-General Holman will remain their chiefmilitary representative. You will confine your activities, to the purely political sphere ;General Holman to the purely military. You will both no doubt be ready at all timesto exchange information, but I see no reason why you should ever encroach on oneanother&apos;s jurisdiction.With regard to His Majesty&apos;s consular officers, instructions will be sent to them tocommunicate to you all the information at their disposal on political matters.Reference must be made in conclusion to the economic aspect of the assistancewhich we are still prepared to afford to General Denikin. As you are aware, acommercial mission is now being formed and equipped by the Department of OverseasTrade, which will probably arrive in South Russia simultaneously with your mission.Their object will be to report on the economic condition of the country, to tender toyou advice on commercial matters for communicatibn to General Denikin and to takesuch steps as are possible for the establishment of British trade and industry withinthe area which Denikin controls. It is also intended to send out a railway expert whowill endeavour to assist in the proper administration of the railways and the repair of&quot;the rolling-stock. It may eventually also become desirable to send a financial expert toadvise on a reorganisation of the currency. I am fully alive to the crying necessity ofassisting Denikin to place on a proper footing both these questions of railways andcurrency, since without that it is clearly impossible to proceed with a normal distributionof food or to bring about a regular system of imports and exports between this countryand Russia.I am, however, of opinion that these and kindred missions should operateindependently of vour mission, which, as I have endeavoured to point out, will bemainly occupied with political issues, but they will of course keep in close touch withyou and will profit greatly by your advice and guidance,; and for this purpose they willbe instructed to report to you on all matters of primary importance.
APPENDIX I.Letter from the Allies to Admiral Kolchak (May 1919).THE Allied and Associated Powers feel that the time has come when it isnecessary for them once more to make clear-the policy they propose to pursue in regardto Russia.It has always been a cardinal axiom of the Allied and Associated Powers to avoidinterference in the internal affairs of Russia. Their original intervention was made forthe sole purpose of assisting those elements in Russia which wanted to continue thestruggle against German autocracy and to free their country from German rule, andin order to rescue the Czecho-Slovaks from the danger of annihilation at the hand ofthe Bolshevik forces. Since the signature of the armistice on the 11th November, 1918,they have kept forces in various parts of Russia. Munitions and supplies have beensent to assist thoset associated with them at a very considerable cost. No sooner,however, did the Peace Conference assemble than they endeavoured to bring peace andorder to Russia by inviting representatives of all the warring Governments withinRussia to meet them in the hope that they.might be able to arrange a permanentsolution of Russian problems. This proposal and a later offer to relieve the distressamong the suffering millions of Russia broke down through the refusal of the SovietGovernment to accept the fundamental condition of suspending hostilities whilenegotiations or the work of relief was proceeding. Some of the Allied and AssociatedGovernments are now being pressed to withdraw their troops and to incur no furtherexpense in Russia, on the ground that continued intervention shows no prospect ofproducing an early settlement. They are prepared, however, to continue theirassistance on the lines laid down below, provided they are satisfied that it will reallyhelp the Russian people to liberty, self-government, and peace.The Allied and Associated Governments now wish to declare formally that theobject of their policy is to restore peace within Russia, by enabling the Russian peopleto resume control of their own affairs through the instrumentality of a freely electedConstituent Assembly, and to restore peace along its frontiers by arranging for thesettlement of disputes in regard to the boundaries of the Russian State and itsrelations with its neighbours through the peaceful arbitration of the League ofNations.They are convinced by their experience of the last twelve months that it is notpossible to attain these ends by dealings with, the Soviet Government of Moscow. Theyare therefore disposed to assist the Government of Admiral Kolchak and hisassociates with munitions, supplies, and food, to establish themselves as the Govern-ment of All Russia, provided they receive from them definite guarantees that theirpolicy has the same object in view as that of the Allied and Associated Powers.With this object they would ask Admiral Kolchak and his associates whether theywill agree to the following as the conditions upon which they accept continuedassistance &apos;from the Allied and Associated Powers.In the first place, that, as soon as they reach Moscow, they will summon aConstituent Assembly elected by a free, secret, and democratic franchise as theSupreme Legislature for Russia, to which the Government of Russia must beresponsible, or if at that time order is not sufficiently restored they will summon theConstituent Assembly elected in 1917 to sit until such time as new elections arepossible.Secondly, that throughout the areas which they at present control they willpermit free election in the normal course for all local and legally constitutedassemblies, such as municipalities, zemstvos, &amp;c.Thirdly, that they will countenance no attempt to revive the special privileges ofany class or order in Russia. The Allied and Associated Powers have noted withsatisfaction the solemn declaration made by Admiral Kolchak and his associates thatthey have no intention of restoring the former land system. They feel that theprinciples to be followed in the solution of this and other internal questions must beleft to the free decision of the Russian Constituent Assembly; but they wish to beassured that these whom they are prepared to assist stand for the civil and religiousliberty of all Russian citizens, and will make no attempt to reintroduce the regimewhich the revolution has destroyed.[1549] C
Fourthly, that the independence of Finland and Poland be recognised, and thatin the event of the frontiers and other relations between Russia and these countriesnot being settled by agreement, they will be referred to the arbitration of the Leagueof Nations. .     ,Fifthly, that if a solution of the relations between Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania,and the Caucasian and Transcaspian territories and Russia is not speedily reachedby agreement, the settlement will be made in consultation and co-operation of theLeague of Nations, and that until such settlement is made the Government of Russiaagrees to recognise these territories as autonomous and to confirm the relations whichmay exist between their de facto Governments and the Allied and AssociatedGovernments.   &apos;Sixthly, the right of the Peace Conference to determine the future of theRoumanian part of Bessarabia to be recognised.Seventhly, that as soon as a Government for Russia has been constituted on ademocratic basis, Russia should join the League of Nations and co-operate with theother members in the limitation of armaments and of military organisationthroughout the world.Finally, that they abide by the declaration made by Admiral Kolchak on the27th November, 1918, in regard to Russia&apos;s national debts.The Allied and Associated Powers will be glad to learn as soon as possiblewhether the Government of Admiral Kolchak and his associates are prepared toaccept these conditions, and also whether, in the event of acceptance, they will under-take to form a single Government and army command as soon as the militarysituation makes it possible.APPENDIX II.Admiral Koltchak&apos;s Reply to Allies (June 1919).(Translation.)THE Government of which I am the head was happy to learn that the aims ofthe Allied Powers, with regard to Russia, are in full accord with the objects whichthe Russian Government is pursuing. The first aim of the Russian Government isto restore peace on the land and guarantee to the Russian people the right of freelydetermining its course through the medium of the Constituent Assembly. Deeplyappreciating the interest of the Powers towards the Russian national movement,and realising that it is perfectly just that they should wish to ascertain the politicalconvictions of the Russian Government, I am ready to confirm the declarations whichI have already repeatedly made, and which I have always considered absolutelybinding.1. On the 18th November, 1918, I accepted power, and do not intend to retain itone day longer than will.be required for the good of the country. On the day of thedefinite destruction of the Bolsheviks, my first aim will be to fix the elections for theConstituent Assembly. The Commission for the preparation of elections is nowworking at full speed. This Commission wrill establish the conditions and order of theelections on the basis of universal suffrage. Considering myself responsible to thisConstituent Assembly, I will hand over all my power to the Assembly to enable it todetermine by a free decision the future constitution of the State. To this I havetaken oath before the Supreme Russian Court, the guardian of right of our State.All my efforts are directed towards offering the Russian people the possibility of areal free expression of its will when civil war ends in the collapse of Bolshevism.Any suspension of the struggle would delay that day, as the Government does notconsider it possible to substitute the undeniable right of legal and free elections bythe restitution of the Constituent Assembly of 1917. This body was elected underthe Bolshevik regime of oppression, and a considerable number of its members are nowin the ranks of the Bolsheviks. Only to a legally-elected Constituent Assembly willbelong the right to decide all the fundamental problems of State, external as well asinternal.2. At the same time, I declare that I am ready to discuss now with the Powersall the international problems in which Russia is involved, in the light of the ideas oflimitation of armaments, prevention of wars, of the progress and free existence of thepeoples ideas which find their final expression in the League of Nations.    The
oGovernment, however, consider it their duty to point out that the final sanction for alldecisions which will be taken in the name of Russia belongs to the ConstituentAssembly. Russia is at the present moment, and will be in the future, only ademocratic State in which all questions relating to alterations of territorial frontiersand international relations will have to be ratified by a representative body.3. Considering it natural and just that a united Polish State should be formedas a result of the war, the Government consider themselves entitled to confirm theindependence of Poland which was proclaimed by the Government of Russia in 1917,whose declarations and obligations we have assumed in their entirety. Definitesanction of the delimitation between Russia and Poland must, according to point 2, bepostponed until the meeting of the Constituent Assembly. We are prepared torecognise at present the de facto existing Finnish Government and to guarantee tothis Government full independence in the internal organisation and administration ofFinland, but the final decision of the question of Finland belongs to the ConstituentAssembly.4. We are willing to prepare, without delay, the solution of problems connectedwith the fate of national groups of Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and the Caucasianand Transcaspian nationalities, and we count upon a speedy solution of thesequestions, as the Government are already now guaranteeing the&amp;autonomy and therights of nationalities. The elements and the character of these autonomous Statesmust of course be determined separately in each case. Should any difficulties arisein the solution of these problems the Government will be glad to accept the peaceablecollaboration of the League of Nations.5. The aforesaid principle of ratification of these covenants by the ConstituentAssembly must of course be applied to the question of Bessarabia.6. The Russian Government once more confirms its declarations of the 27thNovember, 1918, by which it assumes responsibility for all national debts.7. With regard to questions of internal order, which may interest the Powersonly inasmuch as they indicate the political tendencies of the Russian Government,I repeat that there can be no return to the regime which existed in Russiabefore February 1917. The temporary solution of the land problem adopted by myGovernment aims at giving satisfaction to the vast majority of the population. Itis prompted by the conviction that only then can Russia flourish and be strong whenthe many millions of the peasantry of Russia are adequately provided with land.Likewise, in taking over the administration of the liberated portions of Russia, theGovernment places no obstacles on the free activities of the zemstvos and municipalinstitutions. We see in their work and in the strengthening of the principle of localself-government a necessary condition for the resurrection of the country, and weshall assist this local self-government by all the means at our disposal.8. Aiming at the restoration of law and order in the country, and at obtainingpersonal security for the population of Russia, which is weary of oppression, theRussian Government considers all classes equal before the law. They will all,without distinction of religion and nationality, enjoy the protection of the State andof the law. The Government of which I am the head is straining&apos;all the forces andresources of the country in order to achieve the above-mentioned aims. We speak inthese momentous days in the name of national Russia as a whole. I am convincedthat when Bolshevism is vanquished we shall be able to find an amicable solution toall questions in which each of the nationalities whose life is bound up with theRussian State are equally interested.
