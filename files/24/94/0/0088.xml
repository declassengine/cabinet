Edwards), - if the Chancellor of the Bxochequerand the Shipping Controller will allow them to act&quot;&apos; - to workout in detail and report as soon ac possible whatadministrative organisation and business arrangements it isnecessary to introduce for the purpose.      This appears tobe the quickest way of arriving&apos;at a scheme that will meetTreasury and commercial requirements and will be capable ofapplication in the Dockyards.      Lord Colwyn has expressedhis willingness to keep in touch with the Admiralty andadvise, as necessary, on the general lines which we shouldfollow.The question dealt with in Paragraphs 17 to 20 ofthe Committee&apos;s Report is being taken up separately.(Intlld.)

REPORTofLORD COLWYJf&apos;S GObfclTTBEonWORK IN II.Ike DOCKYARDS,Terms of referenceTo coneider how far it may be pociible toutilise any facilities which the Admiralty may have available *for the construction of merchant ehipc of any kind, either -(a) by investigating offere of private shipbuildersto lease such facilities and offer employmentto Admiralty employees who would otherwise becut of employment: -orCb) by considering offers from persons or firmsdesirous of placing orders for new merchanttannage, with a view to the construction ofthe same in Admiralty Docks *The Committee wil also investigate any proposalsfor the use of any part of Admiralty dock accommodation avail-ablelfcr use for commercial purposes, namely, as ports of calland departure for, or as terminal ports for the shipment,unloading, and repair of merchant shipping of any kindo1., We found at the outset that the immediatecrisis had been eased by the order given        to bring forwardNaval work previously allotted to future years, and that asa result further discharges had been reduced to a minimum.2* This arrangement, whilst providing employmentduring this winter, is unsatisfactory in so far as it entailsfurther and larger discharges as soon as this work has beencompleted-     It has, however great value in that it coversthe period which must of necessity elapse before any newscheme that is decided on can become effective.3. We were not asked to examine the generaleconomies of the situation, but we feel that this is a nationalemergency during the continuance of i-,hich it is the duty ofthe Admiralty to provide work&apos;in the Dockyard Towns for themen whom they retained and collected into their service duringthe war/
the Var*        It must be borne in mind that the Dockyard Townsdepend almost entirely upon the Havy for their existence, andhave incurred considerable expenditure in public utilities whichcause a recurring charge on income, and that Admiralty policyin the past has tended to discourage any extension of the Portson commercial lines vrtiich might otherwise have taken place * Itfollows, therefpre, that these Towns have no immediate means offilling the gap^oy the decline of Admiralty expenditure *   Further,the general housing situation throughout the country makes itimpossible for large bodies of men to be transferred elsewhere4o Vie have carefully considered the offers put forwardby private shipbuilders to lease portions pf Dockyards from theAdmiralty, and we have come unaiikjiisly to the conclusion that inno Dockyard has any such si/heme a likelihood of commercial success.The lay-out and organisation of the Yards do not lend themselvesto watertight subdivisions.     There is one source of power (of allkinds) in each Yard, and one set of Shops supplies both newconstruction and repairs *   Dual control of these essentials wouldbe an unworkable proposition, and a ccmrrerci^l firm would requirea priority of user which the riayy could not always afford.      Thiswould entail a considerable alteration, and even addition, to theShops, and a general Increase of power services * (For example,it is found that to carry out the proposal to lease part of Chatham&apos;&quot;to a private firm will entail an immediate expenditure of  130,000?/There would also be a fruitful source of discontent between the twobodies of men in the disparity of wages and conditions of employ^,ment.5* We have examined the possibility of the Dockyardsundertaking mercantile shipbuilding under admiralty controlcBefore the war the building of warships was carried out on lines &apos;&apos;totally different from those that will be necessary if theconstruction of merchant ships is to be a commercial success *Rapidity of delivery and economy of construction were notinvariably the guiding factors.     Mew construct ion was occasion-^-ally delayed by the urgency of repairs to commissioned ships ^alterations in design were continually occurring, and there were,&apos;consequent periods in which v.;ork was proceeding at a rate farbelow the possible outputj and, as In all Government Departments.,the machinery of control is far more elaborate and counts formore than in a private undertaking which has a sufficient protectionin its profit and loss account.     moreover, there are Importantdifferences between merchant ship   and warship building.6. Me do not think the solution lies in the building-bythe Admiralty for themselves of Fleet Auxiliaries&apos;with a viewto the disposal of existing ships.7. We are not prepared to recommend that the Dockyardsshould be given mercantile work unless these guiding factorsc.f rapidity and economy are observed.    At the first, the standardof a long-established shipbuilding firm cannot be expected, but.,it is a standard that should undoubtedly be attempted.6. v.&apos;e consider, therefore, that if merchant shipbuilding&apos;    is/
3 4 5is to be undertaken, certain changes is organisation and inprocedure are essential.   These changes must be   such as willprovide for supervision by men experienced in commercialmerchant shipbuilding, for simplication of procedure, and. inparticular for trusting a very large measure of discretionand responsibility to the local management, in which commercialshipbuiIcing experience must have free play, and with which Labeurshould be associated.9. On the Materiel side, the admiralty should immediatelyreview their existing facilities with the object of bringing themas far as possible into line with the equipment of modernmercantile %$r.k Yards.10,        They will not expect to exercise any right ofpriority in obtaining materials for mercantile shipbuilding.11.        As far as Labour is concerned, we are confident thatthe men will realise that mercantile work would be undertakenprimarily with a view of their employment, and they wouldtherefore co-operate to the fullest/in making the endeavoura success. extent12.        We consider that where vessels are being built toprivate order ant., financed under the terms usual in shipbuildingcontracts there should be no difficulty in giving the responsi-ble shipyard management much the same latitude as would be givenin a private firm.   This will apparently involve some departurefrom the method by which expenditure on warship building andrepairs is controlled, but we do not anticipate any seriousdifficultye The Yards, we believe, have an effective system ofexpense or cost accounting, and all that we need say on thishead is that care should be taken to secure accurate accounts ofbuilding costso   The advice of a professional Accountant withmercantile shipbuilding experience might be useful in theinitial stage *13.        We have considered the methods of building under whichthe Admiralty might obtain orders fcr vessels.     The system of1 time and line1 is not recommended, net do we think that anyfirm would be likely to give orders on such terms to Yards buildingtheir first ships.   But the Admiralty would do well to acceptin the first instance work on the,basis of price of similarvessels in private Yards.14*        If these proposals are accepted, and further, if thematter is taken up whole-heartedly and as the main object ofthe Dockyards, we recommend that the Admiralty should utilisetheir surplus facilities in the construction of mercantile vessels.The concentration on these vessels by the building Yards wouldrelease sufficient repair and reconditioning work to keep thoother Dockyards in employment. .15*        We do not regard this as a permenent solution of thedifficulty ncr recommend that this should be carried onindefinitely*     The future of the Shipbuilding Trade is uncertainand offers no guarantee of a long era of construction.      Butwe consider th t this proposal offers to the Admiralty an expedientfor tiding over -a difficult period of discharge, and the Committeehope and expect that in the present position of Shipping Tradethe Admiralty will be able to build without any loss.In/
3.6,   In regard to tho employment of the dockyards onmanufacture of trade articles, we do not recommend this as ageneral policy.17,   We have lastly considered the- possibilities of thedockyards as the bases of lines of steamers.   The only Dockyardwhich presents reasonable attractions is Devonport which might&quot;be made a terminal port.    At this Yard much handling of ,commercial cargo took place during the w, and we considerthat work of this kind might well &quot;&quot;be continued.18.   The Admiralty should invite offers from Shipownerswho require accommodation at Devonport as a terminal port andevery endeavour should bo made to meet their requirements.19.   Although the arrangements present difficulties, wedo not consider that they are insurmountable.20-   Facilities undoubtedly exist for the efficient andrapid discharging of ships of bulk cargo, and we consider thatevery endeavour should be made to brim? these into immediateuse in view of the grave congestion of&quot;other Ports.21.   We have not taken into consideration such questionsas the type of vessel to be built, the method of providingmachinery, or any of the numerous technical questions whichmust be&apos; dealt with before actual shipbuilding could begin.These are matters for technical men, and we would only saythat we regard it as essential to success that in theirconsideration the Department should make&apos;&apos;-full use of menpossessing commercial shipbuilding experience.22.   In conclusion, we desire to place on record that wehave been greatly helped by the valued advice of the Directorof Dockyards and Repairs, the Director of Navy Contracts,Mr, Kemoall-Oook of the Ministry of Shipping, and the NavalStore Ofiicer, Devonport, who appeared before us..23,   The Director of Dockyards and Repairs, in particular,had a full grasp of the whole situation and rendered^theCommittee very great service, and we are impressed with thegoodwill with which the Admiralty in general have approachedthis innovation.(Signed)Cclwyn.HeNo Bunbury,W-S.
