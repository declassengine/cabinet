[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]CONFIDENTIAL.Political Intelligence Department,(11481.)Foreign Office.France/010.MEMORANDUMon theFRENCH PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.TWO quite different lines of reflection arise in connection with the results of therecent French parliamentary elections. The first, and most obvious, is that a striking,not to say smashing, defeat has been inflicted on the revolutionary or so-called UnifiedSocialists, together with a large reduction in the strength of that which was the mostpowerful group in the last Chamber, viz., the politicians known as Radicals andRadical Socialists, or, as it is more correct to call them, Socialist Radicals, i.e., Radicalswho, while entirely averse to any general upset of the present economic and socialorder of things in France, are broadly popular in their sympathies. The final. resultsof the polls are not yet completely declared. &apos; It seems clear, however, that the numberof Unified Socialist deputies, which was about 102 in the last Chamber, will bereduced, even on the calculation of M. Longuet (himself one of the leaders of the partyin question, who failed to obtain election in Paris) to seventy, while other estimateshave put their number as low as fifty-six. There can be no doubt that this result wasa great blow to the hopes cherished by the party in question. But further, it isimportant to observe that the severity of this defeat, striking enough in itself, isgreatly emphasised by the fact that it has not been secured by any generally effectivedoption of the principle of anti-revolutionary combination involved in the formationof the Bloc or Cartel National Republicain, to which reference was made in the presentwriter&apos;s previous papers on the coming French elections. It was there pointed out thatthe distinctions between the various parliamentary groups, all alike owning the fullestallegiance to the Republican form of government, have reference largely to politicalevents, and particularly those connected with the relation between Church and Stateand the laicizing of public education, which lie well back in the past history of theThird Republic ; that these groups are comparatively little, if at all, divided by issuesof principle in regard to the problems of reconstruction now lying before France ; andthat therefore it appeared to be a rational course for them to combine, as in theformation of the Bloc they purported to do, for the defeat of the so-called UnifiedSocialists, who are avowedly working for the upset of the existing economic and socialorder in France, and who do not pretend to have any aversion to the use of violencefor that end. The Bloc was duly formed, and what might be supposed to be influentialand representative gatherings in Paris adopted an impressive common programme,including as the central feature &quot; Dutte contre le bolchevisme, contre toutes les dictatures-et contre toutes les formes de violence.&quot;It is not to be doubted that the lead thus given in Paris exercised a very powerfulindirect influence throughout the country. But logical people though the Frenchproverbially are, they did not behave logically in. this connection. They wished todefeat the Socialists, and showed this desire decisively enough by voting foranti-Socialist candidates, with the general result already referred to. But thoughthey wished the end, they did not wish, or certainly did not generally take,,the means commended to them by leaders and other experienced politicians inParis the means, that is to say, of putting forward one list of candidates onbehalf of the Bloc National Republicain in each constituency and no more.In order to secure an overpowering demonstration of popular feeling against therevolutionary Socialists it seemed to be of first-rate consequence that the differentsections of Republicans,-in fact, that all Anti-Revolutionary politicians, should put asidetheir differences and concentrate upon a single list of Anti-Revolutionary candidates ineach constituency. In fact, however, it appears to have been quite the exception forthese counsels of self-suppression to prevail. Very generally there were at least two,and often as many as three or four, lists of Republican candidates in one constituency.
In a very considerable number of constituencies, it is true, the title of one of theselists indicated that it was the result of combined action among, and thereforerepresented, different groups of Republicans. Indeed, ironically enough, in not a fewcases there was more than one list with a title having that indication. In the Gers,for example, with live seats to be filled, there was a Liste d&apos;Union republicaine etsocicde, which secured an average of 18,907 votes, and a Lisle d&apos;Union nationalsrepublieaine, which obtained an average of 21,250 votes. In what respect those listsdiffered from one another in positive political significance it is quite impossible foranyone not acquainted with the condition of the Department in question to say, butobviously they divided the Republican strength. That division, however, in this casewas of no consequence, as the Socialist strength was very small, the average of thevotes cast for that list being only 2,457. A more or less similar case was present bythe Department of Meurthe-et-Moselle. Here there was a Liste d&apos;Union republieainewhich obtained an average of 55,891 votes and a Liste de Concentration republieainewhich obtained an average of only 3,972 votes. In that case the average of thevotes cast for the Unified Socialist list mounted to 17,405, but the working of theprovisions of the new electoral law for the benefit of minorities took no account ofthem, and the Anti-Revolutionary cause therefore gained nothing in that constituencyfrom the division of the Republican forces. Very much the same kind of thinghappened in the Department of the Dordogne; there were again two lists, d&apos;Unionrepublieaine and de Concentration republicaine securing an average of some 32,000and 20,000 votes respectively, and there was a Liste liberate apparently representing,notwithstanding its somewhat misleading title, a group of very distinctly Conservativeand even Royalist tendencies. Lists of &quot;this character appeared in a few other con-stituencies, but for the most part the people who might have been expected to vote forsuch lists if they existed must be regarded as having voted, in so far as they did vote,for one or other of the Republican Anti-Revolutionary lists. The Anti-Revolutionarystrength in the Dordogne thus seemed even more divided than in the Meurthe-et-Moselle,but the result was the same, the Unified Socialists only obtaining an average of rathershort of 12,000 votes, and securing no representation at all. In the Loire again, rivallists of Anti-Revolutionaries were run almost as if there were no Revolutionaries at allto be thought of a Radical-Socialist list (which, as has been previously explained, meansRadical with. Socialist sympathies, not vice versa), a Republican-Socialist list (to whicha similar observation applies), and a &quot; Progressist&quot; list which means ConservativeRepublicans. The Republicans and Anti-Revolutionaries could not therefore have beenmore sharply divided among themselves, but although the Unified or RevolutionarySocialists are present in the Department of the Loire in very considerable force, and wereable to muster an average to their list of over 20,000 votes, they only obtained oneseat out of eight certainly no more than under any system of proportional repre-sentation they would have been entitled to. Too much space would be taken up byany further analysis of the provincial results of the elections. It should be observed,however, that in the four constituencies into which Paris is divided, although therewas a similar bewildering variety of lists to divide the Anti-Revolutionary strength, theUnified Socialists succeeded in obtaining only ten seats out of fifty-four. In one section,that of St. Denis et Sceaux, where there was comparatively little division of theRepublican strength, the Bloc Republicain list, with &apos;an average of 150,000 votes,obtained all the fourteen seats, although the Unified Socialist list secured as high anaverage as 112,000.From what has been said, it will be plain that throughout France, as an Anti-Revolutionary demonstration, the result of the elections must be regarded as much moreimpressive than it would have been if in fact the various groups of Republicanshad been generally content to put aside their historical or present differences with aview to the creation of an overpowering Anti-Revolutionary bloc. Politicians of variousshades, and even in several cases of practically the same shade, produced separatelists of candidates, and were supported in the polling booths by the electors whohappened to like them best. The fact that even so only some sixty or seventySocialists were elected throughout the country affords a really striking testimonyto the strength of the forces opposed to any general disorganisation of the existinglife of France by legislation, and still more to any violent upheaval. In fact,,there is a great deal to be said for the view that after her triumphs in 1918France is still, as M. Thiers affirmed that she was after her disasters in 1870, at heartLeft Centre or Conservative Republican. That is all to the good, and affords a strongfoundation for a policy of economic progress and ordered freedom. There seems,moreover, to be good reason to believe that the injunctions widely put forward by the
prelates of the Roman Catholic Church, and especially in Paris, operated to aconsiderable extent to secure the votes of Catholic electors for the lists of candidateswhose success was most likely to be secured as an Anti-Revolutionary demonstration.This illustrates the dying down of the bitternesses connected with old controversies,and affords a cheering promise of co-operation among patriotic Frenchmen for the wisetreatment of the various and most difficult problems involved in the reconstruction ofF ranee.That such co-operation will be, and would in any case have been, most urgentlyneeded after the tremendous disasters and losses through which the country hasfought its way to triumph, is a truth powerfully emphasised by the elections. For itis impossible to regard the results of these elections as in all senses satisfactory.There appears little, if any, doubt that the elections show, notwithstanding the heavyloss in the number of seats held by the Revolutionary Socialists, a seriously largeaccession--as much as from 1,400,000 to 1,700,000-in the total Socialist votes on the16th November, 1919, as compared with those castin .1914 when the last Chamber wasbrought into existence. Moreover, as the total electorate has been reduced by some-thing like 1,000,000 or more through the war deaths, this accession to the Socialistvote means that Socialism has a substantially increased hold on the French people,beyond what is shown by the actual increase in the votes given to the Socialist lists.And although there are a good many cases which might be cited in which the newelectoral law, by its provisions for the representation of minorities, has worked infavour of the Socialists, it seems clear from the broad results already referred to thatthat party will have much fewer deputies in the new Chamber than, on a completelyfair system of representation, they ought to have. Indeed, it is difficult to disguisethe fact that on a thoroughly fair system of representation there ought to have beenan appreciable increase instead of diminution in the number of their deputies elected.Without doubt it will be plausibly and universally urged by the Socialists that the factis so, that they are gravely under-represented, and that there is little, if any, hope oftheir obtaining justice from a Parliament elected under what their defeated leader,M. Longuet, denounces in strident tones as &quot; a monstrous law.&quot; It is speciallyunfortunate that there should be any plausibility in such a contention, and that at thisvery moment there should be an increase in the cost of living, especially in the priceof bread.These considerations emphasise the necessity for a sympathetic and considerateline of policy to be pursued irom the outset by the great Anti-Revolutionary majority inthe&apos; new Parliament. Unfortunately, it is difficult to point to any statesman in Francewho can be regarded with complete confidence as endowed with the gifts necessary tolead that somewhat heterogeneous majority with that combination of firmness andenlightened sympathy which the conditions of France demand. On the whole, at thepresent moment, the names of MM. Millerand and Viviani are those which seem tostand out most prominently among those French politicians who if, as is thought notunlikely, M. Clemenceau should be acclaimed President of the Republic, he mightinvite to form a Cabinet. Both of them have very considerable parliamentary claimsto that position. Both have been, and may possibly still be, enrolled in one or other oftwo small parliamentary groups known as Republican Socialists, and may reasonably beregarded as likely to recognise the importance of a policy inspired by sympathy forthe working-classes of the towns. M. Viviani was Prime Minister at the beginning ofthe war, and, though he was unable to maintain himself in that position, he does notseem to have suffered in parliamentary reputation ; he is probably the most eminent ofliving French orators, and his great speech in support of the ratification of the Treatya few weeks ago produced an immense impression, and was very warmly acclaimed byM. Clemenceau. M. Millerand has occupied with much success, to which Lord Derbypaid a tribute in a recent despatch, the position of High Commissioner of the LiberatedProvinces, and there would certainly be nothing unnatural in his passing from thatposition to the Premiership of the Republic, which has won back, the territory lost toFrance under the Third Empire.December 4, 1919.
