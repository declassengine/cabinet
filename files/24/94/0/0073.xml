Military Secret.1198From Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for hidia,29th November 1919.(Received 8tli December.)16065.   29th November.   Malleson wires as follows, 26th November : &quot; Following additional information regarding the attitude of Afghans in Mervdistricts is given by my Turkman Intelligence Correspondent: &quot; After the somewhat heated discussion reported in my telegram M.D. 02549,dated 16th November, regarding the Bolahevic doctrine on complete ownership, MervAfghans sent a deputation to Tashkend to interview Turkestan Commission on thesubject. This was ostensible object, but they told leading Merv Turkmans con-fidentially that the main purpose of the deputation was to discover real strength ofMahometans in Tashkend area and whether they could be relied on to join Afghansand Turcos (and, I presume, probably Bokhara and Khiva) in active measures againstthe Bolshevics. Messages from leading Turcos asking for &quot; some sign &quot; as to whetherBritish approve of Afghan proceedings in Central Asia continue to reach me, anaffirmative answer would probably have (? most important) effect, as the Turcos stillplace great store on our advice although many Turcos have nominally (? joined)Bolshevics. In the meantime Afghans continue to assure Turcos that considerablereinforcements will be received soon.&quot;
