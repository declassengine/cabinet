document is the property of His Britannic Majestyrs OBVernment).0 . J I U 3 &amp;e Eom hue bill m excise.Hote by the Chancellor of the ffikchegu.grte&apos;wing to the Preach Conferences; I have had no time to study theDraft Bill, but there is one point to which I desire to call immediateattention aShe Excise clause has been, lifted, from an earlier Bill and doesnet seem to me to correspond with the Committee1s intentions,   &apos;2heeffect cvf the clause would, as I understand, be that if the IrishParliament raised Excise, Customs on United Kingdom1s goods enteringIreland would be automatically raised to the same extent but legislat-icn by the Imperial Parliament would be required to raise the Customsduties on foreign or Dominion articles to correspond with this increaseI think that the Committee will agree that this is clearly, wrong,and that it would be hopeless to attempt to defend svuch a provision.Either the Irish Parliament must have complete control of Customs, orit.must be dependent on the Imperial Parliament for any alteration inIrish Customs which it desires,   I believe the latter to have been theintention of the Committee and I submit that it is the right coursefor us to take,, .If we adopt it it WOUld be possible for the Irish Parliament tofavour the consumption of Irish goods&apos;in Ireland by reducing the Exciseeven though there was no corresponding reduction in the Customs duties,but&apos;they would not be able effectively to increase Excise except withthe co-operation of the Imperial Parliament in. respect of Customs*    Ido not anticipate that this co-operation would be unreasonably withheldbut&apos; I submit that the unfettered discretion of the Imperial Parliamentto deal as it pleases with Customs must be- retained.tlntd.)
