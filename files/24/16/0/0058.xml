1. I concur with the Secretary of State for Y/ar in regretting the -d^lay on the part of the various Departments in furnishing ttxeir quotas under the Uar Cabinet&apos;s decision, kuoh of the delay has, of course 3 &quot;been due to the protracted negotiations for the release of men from munition work and to the subsequent strikes. I do not know ifey the War Office have not found it possible tfi prejss the other Departments to a epoedier surrender of men.   I dealt immediately with the one case, that of docks, in which my assistance was sought by the War Office for obtaining their quota.

2. Taking the specific proposals set out in the Adjutant General&apos;s kemorandura of the 31st kay -

(a)     ^Tribunals. -   I must confess that I view with alarm a suggestion for the creation of a fresh army of officials, nor do I favour the appointment of Government officials as Chairmen of Tribunals;   I do not think that the Army would on the ^hole gain.

In respect of the other proposals, some of these originally emanated from my Department and might well,be adopted if any considerable changes are made.      But I frankly confess that, so far as Tribunals are concerned, * I do not think any radical change is going to make much difference or is really needad.     The memorandum which I recently circulated to the War Cabinet on the work of the Tribunals showed that the proportion of men, more particularly fit men, now exempted by Tribunals outside agriculture and the certified occupations is small; and of fit young men almost negligible.   It is tertainly not true of the action of Tribunals either that other national needs are allowed to come before those of the Army, or that Tribunals generally do not realise the


urgent need of the Army for men.   xiy predecessor end I h?ve taken the necessaxy action to guard against such results.     Among the measures vvhich v-ere recently adopted to meet the growing requirements of the Army was the review of Tribunal exemptions, with certain exceptions  held &quot;by men under 31 years of age;   and one striking result was the remarkably small number oi oases which had to be reviewed under this direction.

Q.uotas fr*m the protected industries,., -   I fully agree that immediate measures should be taken to secure that the quotas are supplied.   I can testify that there is strong feeling among Tribunals bocause more is not done to reduce Government exemptions of young men.

(c) Raising the^ajge ltoit for compulsory service. -   I have supported this proposal;    but I ;ti not sure that, for the present, the opportune moment for such a measure hns not passed.   The opposition would be grnvc unless the proposal were accompanied ^y quite definite and drastic measures for taking young men for the Arxay from protected industries and for uoing men over the present military tfge, except voluntarily, only for home defence or the auxiliary services.

(d) Abolishing the period of two months* grace,- -   This would be decidedly advantagsous altho&apos;agh it involves lecislation and probably considerable Parliamentary difficulties. I have already by Regulations reduced to two weeks the time within which an application for the renewal of an exemption ;aay be made *

(e) Special&apos;measures in res&apos;ooqt to young aien. -   At the etfcge at which we have now reached I feel that if further large drafts of men aro to be provided for the Ar^y, in addition to those already agreed to by the War Cabinet, spacial consideration should &gt;&gt;e given to laeasures for withdrawing


exemptions frou: young mer, starting with men of 19 years and going on to other ages sis national requirements demand, on the principle that fit mer of the ages in question are to be kept in civil employment only if they have very exceptional qualifications.   A measure of this kind *-rould appeal to the general public because of its equity;   and   I am not satisfied that, in view of present conditions, it would cause too grave dislocation to be risked.   Before deciding how far such a measure is practicable, and with what reservations, if any, it will be advisable to obtain statements frou the Departments most concerned in retaining fit men of the younger ages in civil life.   If such a measure were adopted, it would be important that as long notice as possible, certainly not less than one or two months, ehould be given before classes of men are taken, so that emploj^ers should be able to take the necessary measures;   and the men ehould be taken gradually go that it could be seen what special measures, if any, were required for the provision of substitutes,

(f)   Compulsory national,service.- It seems to me that, in view of developments during the last months, this measure would be politically impracticable;   nor do I feel that   recent experience goes to confirm its necessity.

3.   My general views on the present evidence, are:-(i) Having regard to the time of the year and to recent occurrences, it does not seem practicable to introduce any new important measures intended to provide men for this year&apos;s operations, (ii) The obvious course is to take such steps as may be necessary for obtaining from the protected industries the number of uen to whose release the TTar Cabinet have already agreed.   In some oases it might be practicable


even to increase the quotas, (iii) My Department should oontinue its action to secure that

Tribunals deal ,v7ith oases striotly. Civ) I have explained in (o) and (e) my views as to taking fit men of the younger ages and extending compulsory service to older men, (v) As to the provision of substitutes, except for agriculture and oextaao skilled occupations, I doubt the neoessity at present of any special measures.   I have always considered that the proper step is to take for the Array the men whom it is thought should be spared. Employers will probably be able as a rule to make their own arrangements-for meeting the loss;   and, in sc far as speoial measures are required, these should generally take tho form of judiciously restricting unessential industries.   For despatch, if for no other reason, it is important to avoid complicated measures.

4.   I venture to suggest that, in considering any further measures as to man power, it is advisable to take account, not only of the present commitments of the County and what changes, if any, may be made, but also what wider use can be made of the very large resources of the Eorpire in native man power and also what modifications in the situation have resulted from the entry into the War of the United States, with their enormous resources in men.
