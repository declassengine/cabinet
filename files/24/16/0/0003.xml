SECRET. G.T.1003

DEVELOPMENT OF THE WE3T3RU PORT3 Off THE UBITED KlffgDQM, &amp;o. (Report by lord Milnar.)

The War Cabinet desired me (War Cabinet 136, Minute 6b. and War Cabinet ISO, Appendix Ge&gt;) to report on the question of the diversion of traffic from the Eastern to the Western ports of the United Kingdom, as far as practicable, and the disembarkation &amp;o. of supplies in the latter ports. &apos;mm

2. In this connection I held a Meeting at which represen-

tatives from the Departments concerned were present,     A large number of difficulties were pointed out and it vrae decided that a trial shipment of 2,000 tons of grain should be made from one of the Western ports to londoru     TM:$ trial, however, has not up to the present been found practicable.

3, As the result of the Meeting I |gni convinced that it was

imperative that an org a? deal; ion should be set up by the Shipping Controller to find out as soon as possible&apos;v/hat each Western port can at present achieve i

(a)     i.   As regards discharging in its various aspects.

ii. As regards storage capacity of the several kinds.

iii. As regards its railway facilities for the further transport of the imports.

(b)   What the ports can be made to do under (a) m ii, and iii*

(o)   The effect the use of the Coast ports and their further

development will have on the distribution question for citie and towns in the vicinity of the East Coast.

(d)   What alterations are necessary to o*\e reomo the difficulties referred to at (c)

(4) To enable this and other minor matters that will arise

in connection therewith to be carried. out, I felt that it was very desirable that a highly capable official should be selected and that he, in associate o;a with a member of the Railway Executive should enquire into ths matter and take such action as may be necessary at the earliest possible moment9

It will be seen from an Extract ^Appendix) from a Report from the Miniatry of Shipping that the Shipping Controller concurs in this view and has take&lt;n the necessary steps with Kg view to utilising to the fullest possible extent the West Coast &apos;porta,     I agree to his suggestion that the Ministry of Shipping should be given a grea hand to develop this policy in co-operation with all- other Dspartmett-ja affooWd, 111 suggest that the War Cabinet should give them authority to proceed with such improve-

menta as m$y be necessary., after consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer as regards funds, required for this purpose 

6.        The War Cabinet also desired me to report on the safety of the porta generally, and I therefore comBunicated with the First Sea Lord on this -subject,, and the following is an extract from the letter I have received from himi-

&quot;If a chart of the British Islands is e&amp;amined* it will be seen that a very large proportion of the ships bringing supplies into this country have to pass between a a point near the Land&apos;s End and the Ilorth of Ireland, because those bound to London and the southern East Coast &gt; ports pass near LandTs End on their way up Channel, and the whole of the shipping bound to ports between Land&apos;s End and Glasgow must enter between those two points,

&quot;It is therefore perfectly obvious that from the point of view of safety, which is the main Admiralty consideration, the development of Western ports is essential, since every yard, that a ship traverses aft&amp;j? passing the Land&apos;s End going up Channel means additional .risk both on the outward and homeward journeys. |p|

&quot;The risk to a ship on her, way to her discharging port sifter passing Land&apos;s End may be considered as proportionate to the distance to be traversed, if we assume that the risk on all routos is the sane.     On this assumption a ship would reach Liverpool at about the same risk as a ship reaching Beachy Heal.    If she were to discharge anywhere between Land&apos;s End and Beaohy Head or Land&apos;s End and Liverpool, we should be so much to the good, but if she goes beyond Beaehy lie d-d- she io incurring added risks as compared with discharging at Liverpool,   It is, however, fairly evident, I think, from statistics that the dangers to be encountered going up Channel are greater than those going to Liverpool, because, in spite of the fact that the patrols in the Channel are infinitely stronger than those en route to Liverpool, the losses are at least as heavy and the coast is one which offers greater opportunities for minelaying&quot;.

This expert view emphasises the ne ed of the development of the Western ports.

7.     With reference to the Report of Lord St.Davids&apos; Committee (G.T..495), I am of opinion that their proposals should generally &quot;be adopted on the principle that the Irish ports should deal, as far as practicable, with the whole of the imports required for consumption &amp;c. in Ireland, and that the Scottish Ports recommended by the Committee should be developed to the fullest extent that may be found to be possible within the next twelve months..

The Shipping Controller has proceeded with

-V.      J. \mj

his plans tor dealing ^ith the pre^blem,   A special Branch of the Ministry of Shipping has &quot;been organised under Mrc&gt;1 a A &lt;, P^Warner, whose services havo been lent by the Mersey Docks &amp; Harbour Board. The Port &amp; Transit Executive Committeo which was set up by the late Government and &quot;vested with executive power to deal with this and kindred matters is now located in the Ministry, and steps have been taken to secure effective co-ordination of i s work   with that of the new Brancho    In this way a large? and it is believed effective organisation, has sprung into being under the direct control of,the Ministry of Shipping; and the Admiralty having from the standpoint of safety expressed a definite view in favour of the fullest possible utilisation of the West Coast Ports, it is suggested that the Wax-Cabinet should now give the Ministry of. Shipping a free hand to develop this policy energetically in cc-opcration with&quot;  the port, railway and other authorities affected*    It has become abundantly clear that if substantial results   are to be achieved, the port problem and the railway problem must be treated as one, the multiplication of separate Committees avoided , end authority concentrated as;   far as possible in one DepartmentQ
