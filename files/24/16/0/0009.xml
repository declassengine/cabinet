Petregrad 8th Junta

On the Northern front Kerenski has boon received with the usual enthusiasm.    An incident occurred in the 12th Army which shows what is tho feeling there.    After calling on the men to advance a soldier got up and said that if they advanced they would bo killed and then land and freedom would bo no use to them So tho Government must   (group omitted) peace as soon as possible

Kerenaki told the regiment to issue an order sending the man home and said all would know he was a coward: tho Colonel asked permission to send several others home who had expressed similar views to his*   A Praporsehik then got up and said there had formerly been enthusiasm and readiness to advance. Sow there was no enthusiasm and it was impossible to advance. What was going on in rear of the Army was to blame for this. Instead of reinforcements arriving, only nominal rolls and banners with inscriptions about freedom arrived at the front and it was impossible for tho officers to convince the men of tho necessity for advancing.

At Dvinsk another soldier got up and said that though ho believed in Kerenski he could not believe in the provisional Government which was composed of Bourgeois.

Kerenski when publicly addressing 3th Amy called on Bragomirov to take immediate steps to stop fraternisation with the Germans and agitation in favour of making a separate peace.

ifrrom many incidents that have occurred during Kerenski *s visit to tho northern front I m afraid that his influence will last no longer than the length of his stay on the front    He has already gone to Moscow and is expected in Petrograd tomorrow. On his return I will endeavour to see him* \ S
