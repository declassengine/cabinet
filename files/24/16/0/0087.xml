WEEKLY REPORT ON RUSSIA. DC.

June 18, 1917.

The Government, the Army and the C.W.S.D.

The real centre of interest in Russia at the present moment lies in the attitude of the army.   The Moderate Socialists, who have joined the Government, have to fight the Extremists on two fronts: both among the workmen in the cities and anong the soldiers in the army.     For the time being they have secured a majority in Petrograd as was shown by the results of the recent municipal elections there, but without the support of the army they cannot hope to deal with their opponents either on the Left or on the Right.   If the Central Government is to continue to exist it must have both a strong and a united army.   This fact is being more clearly recognised by all those Socialists who take a commonsense view of the difficulties ahead and of the dangers of a counterrevolution.

It is becoming more and more evident that Mr Kerenski is carrying the vast majority of the Social Revolutionary party with him in his campaign for a strong well-disciplined army, capable of taking the offensive.   It was a bold step for Mr Kerenski to advocate an energetic offensive, as the very word &quot;offensive&quot; was repugnant to the bulk of the Socialists, whose dream was an early peace and a world-wide revolution.   Mr Kerenski nevertheless took this step, and by the appointment of General Brusilov showed that he meant to carry it through.   By so doing he has helped to clarify the position of the Socialist politicians as a whole, and the result has been satisfactory.   Mr Tseretelli, who occupies the same

position among the Social Democrats as Mr Kerenski does among the Social Revolutionaries, has given his full support to the Government and has been delivering a series of stirring speeches which have called forth bitter opposition from the Extreme Left.   The two leaders of the opposition to the Government are now Messrs Trotski and Lenin.   The former has recently returned from America and is taking up a far more extreme line than was expdcted.   He refuses any suggestion of a compromise with the bourgeoisie and for this reason condemns the Coalition Government.   Mr Kerenski he accuses of Bonapartism.   The best ansrer to such attacks has been given by a writer in the Radical paper Dyen:-   &quot;He who fears Bonapartism in Russia ought to give his attention not to possible candidates as Bonapartes, but to the   conditions which may make the appearance of a dictator inevitable&quot;.   It is men like Trotski and Lenin, concludes the writer, who are creating such conditions.

Differences in the Cadet Party.

In a previous report I alluded to differences in the Cadet party.   Though no open split has yet occurred, it may safely be said that the only thing which holds the party together is the fear of anarchy.   Long before the Revolution there were two wings of the Cadet party, the more Radical being represented by Mr Nekrasov, now Minister of Ways and Communications.   Mr Nekrasov has recently been forced to make his position clear and now stands half-way between Mr Milyukov and the Cadeto.   As a writer in the paper Dyen recently put it:-   &quot;Nekrasov is not in favour of the Revolution extendingj   the ideas of the international solidarity of the working classes are alien to him.   He does not believe in the restoration of the International, and he does not honestly understand the peace campaign carried on by the C.W.S.D.   But he is a real upholder of a bourgeois democratic Russia, and is now

nearer to Tseretelli than to Milyukov.   Milyukov would have to turn the Revolution back in order to return to power;   all that Hekrasov has to do to remain in power is to keep the Revolution where It is&quot;.

Separatist Tendencies.

The attitude of the non-Russian nationalities may have an important effect upon the Central Government in Petrograd. Though the Socialists have proclaimed the principle of the &quot;self-determination of nationalities&quot;, they are not willing that the various nationalities In Russia should take it upon themselves to decide their own future without considering the interests of the Russian people.   For this reason they object to any decisions being arrived at before the Constituent Assembly meets.

It is among the Finns that the separatist movement has been strongest.   The bourgeois parties in Finland have demanded independence, while the Social Democrats demand independence in all matters except foreign policy, but they make a further demand that the Finnish Constitution should be guaranteed by the other European Powers,     Russian Socialists object to the latter clause, which, they say, would be treating Russia in the same way as Turkey was formerly treated.   The main objection, however, is that the attitude of the Finns will be the signal foretell the other nationalities to begin a campaign in fav_pur of separation from Russia.   In view of the movement that has already begun amongst the Poles and Ukrainians in favour of separate armies, it is obvious that the difficulties of the Government will be greatly increased unless all these national questions are postponed till the end of the war.

Among the various non-Russian nationalities the people that would be most likely to support a Btrong centralised Government

are the Jews.   The Jews have no territorial claims and are anxious to support a strong Russia in which they will be citizens with equal rights.   There are about 300,000 Jews in the Russian army and they have no desire to form themselves into a separate army.   It seems likely, therefore, that if the separatist national tendencies develop in Russia the Socialists In Petrograd will find themselves relying more and more on the Jews. An illustration of this may be found in the fact that when the Ukrainian Nationalists in Kiev proposed to set up a separate Constituent Assembly before the Russian Constituent Assembly met, they were strongly opposed both by the Jews and the Kiev Council of Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Delegates.

War Aims.

Although certain elements in the Socialist press and in the C.W.S.D. have hastened to express their dissatisfaction with the Notes of Great Britain and America to Russia, there is reason to hope that moderate counsels will prevail.   Those Socialists who have joined the Government will probably show themselves more and more reasonable as they recognise the practical difficulties in the way of the literal interpretation of the formula &quot;No annexations, no indemnities&quot;.   The Russians are gradually coming to see that firmness on the part of the Allies, who have already shown their willingness to meet the Russian Government as far as possible, is the most likely way to bring all parties to reason on the question of war aims.   The C.W.S.D. does not dare to suggest breaking faith with the Allies, and when faced with a firm but conciliatory attitude on the part of Great Britain, France and America is bound to descend from general phrases to the actual details of the peace settlement.   There has been a tendency in the Socialist press to interpret the phrase &quot;The right of nations to determine their own fate&quot; very vaguely, on

the ground that the changes in the njap of Europe that such a settlement would demand would prolong the war indefinitely. This war weariness is the inevitable outcome of the inactivity of the Russian army, but may largely disappear as the result of the very determined stand which has recently been taken by the Governments of Great Britain, Prance and America.
