d of Trade have examined with care the Report an of the Tonnage Priority Committee relating to July, especially with regard to the items which directly interest the Board.   The Board fully admit the gravity of the tonnage situation, and do not question the necessity for cutting down the imports to be admitted in July by an amount roughly equal to that indicated in the Report. They are bound, however, to call serious attention to the following considerations.

The articles which directly concern the Board of Trade are dealt with as follows in the Report.   The list is:

	Demand	Suggested reduction	Demand reduced to

Petroleum	Tons. 128,000	Tons 28,000	Tons 100,000

Timber	163,000	103,000	60,000

Cotton	34,500	17,000	17,500

Paper and Paper materials	51,350	25,000	26,350

Oats for Horses	120,000	60,000	60,000

Miscellaneous,including Oil Seed Cakes, Starch, Dextrine and Farina.	/7?4,OOP70	23,000	/J31,oqp/0

The suggested reductions are understood to be tentative and provisional and subject to detailed examination.

As regards these items the following observations are made:-

1. With regard to Petroleum, it would seem that so far as regards petroleum products carried in tank steamers,which accounts for about 97,000 tons out of the Board of Trade demand, no real question of priority of tonnage arises.

Petroleum cannot come except in tank steamers, and tank steamers are practically unsuited to carry anything else. Hence, it would seem preferable to exclude both tank steamer tonnage and the demands upon that tonnage from the priority table.   It follows that the proposed reduction of 28,000 tons is really illusory (except so far as regards the small proportion of saving which might be effected on lubricants), sinoe the cutting down of the demand by this amount would free no tonnage for general trade. With the remaining 30,000 tons of petroleum (lubricants) the case is different, since they can be carried in ordinary ships, but any reduction in lubricants beyond 5,000 tons at the outside would be very dangerous.

2. As regards Timber, the proposed reduction of 103,000 tons, even if practicable, would not set free a corresponding amount of tonnage to carry other imports. Excluding the comparatively unimportant item of Hard Woods, whioh are imported in limited quantities to meet urgent munition demands, the great bulk of the timber still imported is licensed subject to tho conditions of a cortificate given by the Ministry of Shipping that the timber does not displace food or munitions.    In the case of Pit Props imported from Prance and Portugal, which accounts for nearly half of the whole timber demand, the timber must be carried in ships that carry coal outward and would otherwise return in ballast.    Practically the only saving of tonnage in cutting down the import of Soft Woods is represented by the time that would be saved in loading.

3. Cotton.   The Board of Trade demand for Cotton (34,500) is much below the corresponding imports of 1916.

The condition of stocks at present is such that any further reduction will bring us perilously near to a cotton famine, leading to panic in the cotton trade. After most careful consideration the Board of Trade are not prepared to reduce their estimate for cotton.

4. Paper and Paper Materials.    After consulting the CShairman of the Paper Commission, the Board of Trade are prepared if it is absolutely necessary to acquiesce

in a reduction of 20,000 tons in paper and paper materials imported in July on condition that if circumstances admit of it the reduction will be made good later in the year, and also provided that the Shipping Controller will follow instructions to be given by the Paper Commission as to the class and source of imports of paper and paper-making materials most urgently needed in view of the paper shortage at home.   In agreeing reluctantly to this reduction, the Board of Trade cannot shut their eyes to the probability that any reduction of pulp from Norway will merely result in ships sailing only partially loaded, so that here again the saving in tonnage may to a great extent prove illusory.

5. Oats for Horses.    The Chairman of the Committee on the Feeding of Horses considers that the proposed reduction of 60,000 tons in July is utterly impossible. Stocks of Oats have been allowed to fall so low, that after making all allowances, at least 480,000 tons must be imported in the four months July to October.   If as an emergency measure imports for July are allowed to fall to 100,000 tons, this could only be on the understanding that the deficiency will be filled up before October. No further reduction than the above seems possible.

6. As

6,    As regards miscellaneous requirements, it is difficult owing to the variety and number of the items to say precisely what reduction is possible, but it seems highly improbable that so great a reduction as 23,000 tons is practicable.    All that can be said is that some reduction may be looked for under this head, and perhaps the aggregate reduction may be provisionally put at 13,000 tons.

It will be seen from the above that (apart from

Ithe cases of Timber and Petroleum, which stand quite by themselves) the reduction suggested by the Chairman of the Tonnage Priority Committee on imports for which the Hoard of Trade are responsible is 125,000 tons out of a total of 280,000 tons,   or not far off half the total.

In view of the fact that the whole of these imports are articles of the most vital necessity for the prosecution of the war and the maintenance of our economic existence, and the Board of Trade demands under each heading had already been drastically cut down, it is quite impossible to accept so heavy a reduction.    The reduction to which the Board of Trade can conditionally agree (though in some cases with reluctance and misgiving) amounts to over 53,000 tons, or nearly 20 per cent of the total - a higher percentage than that borne by the total deficiency to the total weight of imports of all kinds.     This is the ottt-side reduction which it is possible to accept. No doubt the modification will involve a somewhat larger reduction in imports of some kinds of munitions and food, tyut the programme of imports under these heads is so huge that a comparatively slight percentage reduction will * suffice to meet the case.
