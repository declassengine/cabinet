WEEKLY REPORT ON RUMANIA. VIII.

June 13, 1917.

Party Feeling In Parliament and the New Orientation.

After eleven days&apos; recess the Rumaniai Parliament resumed its session on June 2.   The interval had &quot;been devoted partly to the work of the Committees of two Houses appointed to draft the proposed constitutional reforms, partly to the visit of M. Albert Thomas.     According to all accounts thia was extremely successful and M. Thomas had not only a friendly, but an enthusiastic reception.   He has the double advantage of being at once a Frenchman and a Socialist, and accordingly is an ideal person for bringing the Rumanian authorities into friendly relations with the new Socialist movement in Russia.

When Parliament met again on June 2 there was, wires Sir George Barclay, &quot;much bitterness in the debate of the first sitting&quot;.   The new Labour Party (discussed in Weekly Report VII) read a declaration charging the Ministry with corruption and announcing that the Labour Party would oppose the Prime Minister&apos;s proposals not because of the reforms themselves, but because they were introduced by the man who had brought Rumania into the war unprepared and who was responsible for her defeat.

At a previous sitting the new party had already published its programme, which goes much further than that of the Prime Minister and is deoidedly Socialistic in tone.   The question at once arises, however, why the new party, if, as it says itself, it approves the Prime Minister&apos;s reforms so far as they go, should announce its intention of opposing them in Parliament.

of the Government&apos;s proposals as to franchise and agrarian reform would be the overwhelming strengthening Of the democratic vote in the country, and consequently of any party which is the champion, as the new Labour Party declares itself to be, of the Demooracy.   If, then, the Labour Party is embark&amp;ig on a campaign of opposition to Mr Bratianu&apos;e proposals, this can only be described as essentially a party move.   Till we possess full particulars as to the composition of the new party it is impossible to say what their object is in taking up this attitude. Three alternatives, however, present themselves as possible explanations of their conduct*

(1) The most obvious end straightforward explanation, though not, it seems to me, the most probable, is that the new Labour Party Is sincerely anxious to introduce at once reforms on the lines of, though going far beyond, those which Mr Bratianu has proposed.   Possibly tfcpy consider that women&apos;s suffrage ought at ence to be adopted as a part of the programme of universal and equal franchise announced by Bratianu.     Possibly they consider that even the enormous extension of peasant ownership of the land from 53 to 85 per cent, of the whole country which Bratianu has promised is inadequate, and in this view the peasants, whose hopes have been unduly raised to the highest point, might concur. But, further, there is the possibility that they dread the recoveryiby Bratianu of some of the popularity which he has completely lost if he can claim for himself and his party the merit of conferring on the peasant population the ownership of most of the land ahd, from their numbers, a preponderant voice in the future direction of politics.

On this hypothesis the Labour Party is a perfectly honest ox^nisation, and the first plank in its platform is the overthrew


78

3.

of Bratianu and his party as a necessary preliminary to the introduction of a new era*

(2) It is, however, quite a possible hypothesis that the new party has by no means the character that it openly claims for itself*   Apparently it consists mainly of former supporters of Bratianu.   While some of them, like Professor Iorga, may be perfectly honest and independently-minded reformers, it is impossible to avoid the suspicion that after all the formation and activities of the party may be inspired by Mr Bratianu himself or by important obstructionist elements in the Cabinet and the Liberal and Conservative parties.   Bratianu&apos;s attitude in the past gives rise to the suspicion that even now, in spite of his protestations, he does not wish the reforms he has been forced by the course of events to introduce to pass into law.   He knows that it is practically certain that the introduction of an entirely democratic regime would sap the foundations of his party organisation, and that in view of his record and the traditions of his party it would be practically impossible for him to make himself a dominant factor in the future political life of ttumania.   He may, therefore, have adopted the round-about method of instigating the formation of an allegedly independent democratic party to denounce his reforms as inadequate and consequently successfully to obstruct their passing into law.   It is clear s that if the reforms are defeated this can only be with the help of a large number of deputies of Mr Bratianu&apos;s party, for he has overwhelming majorities in both Houses:   80 out of 125 in the Senate, and 138 out of 183 in the Chamber of Deputies, to say nothing of the support at present accorded him by the Conservative &quot;Fusionist&quot; party.   According to Article 128 of the Rumanian Constitution changes in the Constitution can only be introduced if at least two-thirds of the members of both Houses are present


79

4.

and there is a majority of at least two-thirds in favour of the changes.     it is, therefore, by no means inconceivable that the new Labour Party, if, with or without the approval of tho Prime Minister, it succeeds in winning the support of a certain number of the Liberal deputies, may successfully obstruct the proposed reforms.   This suspicion is at present a mere hypothesis, but in view of Mr Bratianu&apos;s past record and the character of party politics in Rumania, it jjrosents itself as perhaps the most likely explanation.

(3) The aim of the new Labour Party in obstructing the proposed reforms may be to rander it impossible to introduce the necessary changes by constitutional methods.       They may be thinking not of Parliamentary reform, but of revolution. If so, it is of course to their interest to discredit Mr Bratianu and his political colleagues still further and work up feeling in the country to the point of view that only by a violent convulsion can the country be saved.   If that is the case, they are probably relying on the discontent of the peasant soldiers as a whole.     It may be that they have in view the possibility of a coup d&apos;etat led by General Averescu or by some other popular soldier.   It may be, though this seems fGr   the moment improbable, that Take lonescu wdll sooner or later get into touch with the movement if this is its character.

Till more is known about the new Labour Party comment must be confined to the exposition of the possible reasons for their present attitude.   The study of the movement, whatever its character, is essential to any proper judgment of the future political development of Rumania.

Pis3ension-within the Ministry.

Sir George Barclay wires the &quot;most confidential news&quot; that


80

5.

Mr Take Ionescu is urging the Prime Minister to rid the Cabinet of two of its most unpopular members, Constantinescu and STintila Bratianu.   The former was up till last December Minister of Agriculture, in vsfoich&quot; connection he played a prominent part in the conclusion of the famous corn deals last year. Since December he has been in charge of the Ministry of the interior. Vintila Bratianu, whom his brother made Minister of War last August, has been the chief person connected with the Banca Nationals Romans, one of the most important financial and political assets of the Liberal party, and he held the post of Reporter-General on the Budget.   Both Ministers are naturally unpopular owing to their connection with the old financial regime and its abuses, and Mr Take Ionescu is obviously doing wisely in advising the Prime Minister to get rid of these two colleagues, as a sign that he is really in earnest in his desire to introduce a new regime free from the corruption of the old.

German Political Intrigues in Wallaohla.

News as to conditions in occupied Wallaohia is very scanty. An interesting despatch, however, appears in the Nleuwe Rotterdamsche Courant (May 20) from its Berlin Correspondent on his return from a short tour in Wallachia.   He is naturally full of praise for the German Administration and the efforts which it has made to develop the productive powers of the province to the full, and describes the way in nihich they have introduced scientific farming and ample agricultural machinery.   He makes the interesting admission that the German authorities are going out of their way to conciliate the powerful .boyars of the occupied districts.   He says that the boyars feel themselves flattered by the confidence that the victorious Marshal (Mackensen) shows them.   &quot;Mackensen&apos;s door stands always open to them.   They on their side willingly show what power their


81

6.

influence in the country has&quot;.    At this point the censor intervenes and outs out several lines.   It is quite .clear, however, that the Germans are not neglecting the opportunity of knitting still closer their relations with the big landed-proprietors, who have in the past been their strongest supporters in Rumania. These latter naturally dread the coming democratisatioa of the country and expropriation of themselves and their class, which are inevitable if tho Entente Powers are victorious.    Both from sentiment and from policy they will support the German invaders and do everything in their power to help them.   The peasants, on the other hand, do far as they take any interest in international politios&gt; have received the invaders with apathy or distrust, and the correspondent gives an amusing account of the difficulty which the authorities have found in forcing the peasants to work hMKler and more continuously in the fields and to give up their practice of taking a holiday whenever it is a favourite Saint&apos;s day.   To stimulate this work and thereby secure more food for the Central Powers is, of course, a prime object with the military authorities.   But they look still further M  m ahead and, as the Correspondent says, &quot;the friendship of this rich land seems to the Germans very important for the future and they govern accordingly with an easy hand&quot;.
