GRAIIT OP AS AMNESTY TO IRISH POLITICAL PRISONERS.

(Circulated by direction of the Prime Minister)

for information.

I.    Memorandum, lay the Irish Seoretary.

The Prime Minister,

I think it necessary to point out the increasing urgency of the question whether amnesty i3 to be granted to any or all of the Prisoners of the Irish Rebellion.

.The agitation which I foresaw has begun in earnest under the guidance of the Sinn Fein leaders, Griffith, Plunkett and others,.with the help of all sorts of agencies which normally would, not be at thoi* service,&apos; - i Their meetings seem to be designed and organised so as to have the maximum of effect in disturbance;   The meeting places are so selected that prohibition must generally be the only alternative to serious tumult. At. such a meeting in Dublin on Sunday evening last a police officer was killed by one of the violent mob whom Plunkett and his associates .had assembled. ojp/  

Under ordinary circumstances I would not invite any interference or help.   I should think: it my duty .merely to see that the threatened disturbances were prevented or suppressed.

But Griffith, Plunkett and the others seem to me to deserve a policy of repression with the natural consequences of strife, local and general excitement, and conflict between .the populace and the servants of the Crown.   Probably they ha e timed their agitation so that when the Convention is ready for its pacificatory work they may distract attention from it or excite hostility against it by the provocative means which they will employ.

The Griffith and Plunkett agitation depends on tte cry for amnesty.   There is natural reluctance to forestall it or counteract it by a step which ought to spring only from the grace of the Crown..   But it seems to me that the gravest political consequences are involved in the deoision to be taken, and what I deprecate more than anything in this state of the facts is that^ on a future day when amnesty has ceased to be of use as a step  &apos; in the policy of the Government, it may prove an inevitable necessity,    7!e should then pay a double penalty, for a postponed decision. &apos; &gt;^Si \ &apos;

8!t |l        if no amnesty is to be granted a decision now to that effect would at any rate guide the Irish Executive in decisions which they must take concerning administrative action from day

to day.    wwlp^&apos;&apos;:;        1111 &apos;     Stf s

I believe no great body of opinion in Ireland wauld resent the release of the prisoners.   The matter is much discussed, and feeling seems to me to be no greater than when the release of the interned prisoners v/as under conaideration.   The chiefs of both the police forces, however, draw as is natural, a distinction between the men who conducted the fighting in whioh


police offioers were shot and the general body of the prisoners. The distinction, is intelligible and agreeable to my own feelings, but I hare grave doubts whether it would be sustained in principle or in practice,

Mr. Devlin, who made a very direct appeal to you for amnesty in his speech yesterday about Willie Redmond, spoke to me on the subject afterwards.     He professes, and I am sure with absolute sincerity,a confident expectation that the sittings of the Convention in Dublin will bo made centres of Sinn Fein&apos; interference unless (a)   there is amnesty, or (b) elaborate police arrangements are made which would give to the Convention an entirely unforeseen character.

11      COPY OF LETTER FROM MR.G.J.WARDLE. M.P. 50 THE PRIME MINISTER..DATED 11th J01E.1917..

Dear Mr. Lloyd George,

It was my intention in the debate- this afternoon to have referred to the matter of the release of the Irish political prisoners, and to add my appeal to that,of Mr. Devlin that the Government might find itself in a position to order their release, I feel sure if this could be done in a bold and magnanimous way it would lead to an assuagement of the present* difficulties and create a better atmosphere for the Convention from which we all hope so much. &apos;   &apos;.

Yours sincerely,

(Sa)       GEO. J. WARBLE.
