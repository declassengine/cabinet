1148.   Refer once your telegram of 31st May, Ho.80017 and connected correspondence.     Please suspend further recruitment for labour battalions and lumbermen as shipping cannot at present bo provided.

From Viceroy, Army Department, dated 10th June,1917.

8560.   Your telegram of the 4th instant, 1148. Recruitment of Labour Corps for France has been suspended but propose despatching all labourers actually recruited for whom shipping has already been arranged.     Please inform us. how long shipping stringency is likely to continue as our organisation for labour recruitment is well developed and to disband it and subsequently&apos; reconstitute it will involve delay. .   Further the situation thus&apos; created would be liable to misinterpretation by labourer class and cool enthusiasm that has been created.
