WEEKLY REPORT ON SPAIN. II, June 18. 1917.

The event of the week is the resignation just announced of the recently formed Ministry of Senor Garcia Prieto (Marquis of Alhuce-mos).     It was not altogether unexpected, as there was an atmosphere of ministerial crisis all last week.     Whether the late Ministry intended to face the Cortes or whether it could have done so successfully will now cease to be points of discussion and must remain unknown.    But there is evidence that Count Romanones and his friends did not intend to spare their successful supplanters, and it is possible that the intention of Per02 Caballero, one of Romanones  olosest allies and the actual author of the much discussed article &quot;Fatal Neutrality&quot;, to raise a debate in the Senate on the oause of the crisis which led to the fall of Romanones, may be one of many circumstances which have prevented Senor Garoia Prieto from clinging vary resolutely to office.     The Radical leader, Senor Lerroux, had previously announced his intention of raising the same issue in the Chamber.

But the immediate and principal cause is undoubtedly to be looked for in the relations of the Government with the Army. These have caused anxiety for some little time.     What has actually taken place is not very clear, at any rate in any detail.     We have heard of the Minister of the Interior announcing that the Captain General of Barcelona reported that absolute quiet prevailed there. But we had not heard of any disturbance having previously occurred there.     We have heard of the formation of secret Committees among the officers of the Infantry in the garrisons for the defence of the interests of the Army.     These Committees appear to have existed for

about a year, but not much had been heard of them till lately. But it appears that the committee at Barcelona recently took certain action whioh lea to the arrest of some of the officers.     The Captain General who carried out the arrests at the order of the Government, nevertheless did not conceal his sympathies with the officers. He was replaoed by General Marina who was very coldly received on his arrival and had to listen to an extraordinary address from the officers demanding the release of those who had been arrested, and the recognition of the Committee, the dissolution of whioh had been  *d ordered by the Government.     The address contained other demands,, requested a reply within 12 hours and included no expressions of loyalty, according to the reports received.     General Marina seems to have capitulated contrary to his orders and given some kind of recognition to the Committee.     This whole incident was naturally at once regarded as a very grave matter, led to a consultation be-tween the Premier and the leaders of the Opposition and has played the chief part in bringing about the resignation of the Ministry.

Very little is known of what the officers actually said or did.     In a country with such a history as Spain, the civil Government is almost certain to be very nervous about military unrest, and, knowing that public opinion will also be nervous, to endeavour so far as possible to hush up all incidents pointing to its existence.     It seems that the officers put forward grievances about the distribution of rewards in connection with the Morocco campaign, alleging with great probability that the rewards mostly fell to relations of prominent generals.     They also complained of the failure of the Government to provide properly for national defence, and of anti-military outbreaks on the part of the revolutionaries.

It is probably in this last direction that the real root of the trouble chiefly lies.     All the evidence goes to show that


Spain is increasingly divided between two more and more b03tile partias and that the position of any Government, standing as it necessarily must between the two, is increasingly diffioult. German intrigue has, no doubt, played upon this situation to irritate the army and has even managed, strangely enough, as was noted last week, to enlist the anarohists in a similar campaign.     A marshalling of the army and the revolutionary anarchists in a joint oampaign against the supposed danger of intervention on the side of the allies is certainly a stroke which doss oredit to the ingenuity of its authors .     But it may easily be pushed too far, and the cohesion of such unnatural allies does not appear to have much promise of durability. Meanwhile it brings about ourious inoidents.     The Ateneo the prinoipal learned society of Spain, lately met at Madrid and passed a resolution protesting against the submarine attack on the Patricio.   This attitudw produced two results.     A mob, probably of German or military organisation, threatened the members and assailed them with such unintentionally humourous ories as &quot;Down with the Intellectuals.&apos;   Down with civilisation.&apos;    Long live Germany.&apos;&quot; The members beat off these assailants without serious results, but a more significant incident followed,     An artillery lieutenant took upon himself to ord r a professor to move on, and on the professor resenting his peremptory tone had him conducted to a military prison. There he remained for some hours.     But what is even more striking than this arbitrary arrest is the fact that the Minister of the Interior next day disclaimed all responsibility and declared the matter to be outside his jurisdiction.     It would be altogether unfair to talk of such an isolated incident as a Spanish Zabern. But it throws an alarming^, ight on the military temper with which Spanish Governments have to deal.

The Ministry, in fact occupying as any Ministry in Spain must, a position of something like neutrality at home as well as abroad, is in a very difficult position.     For the Spanish temperament is like the Russian, extremist, and good judges consider that tho only two parties in Spain which arouse enthusiasm are the Ultra-Clericals or even the Carlists on the one side and the Republicans on the other, and if the Government has to meet the pressure of the Church and the Army it has al30 to meet that of the democratic elements which are largely anti-dynastic.     How largely this is so appears from the further accounts which which have now come in of the great demonstration at Madrid on May 87 which was the Radical and pro-Entente reply to Senor    Maura&apos;s meeting.     An examination of the speeches indicates that all were strongly democratic, many were openly anti-dynastic, some definitely pro-Entente, wfrile only one, that of Senor Lerroux, favoured actual intervention in the war.     The resolutions carried declared that it was in the interest of Spain to direct her international policy towards France and England and &quot;to break off diplomatic relations with Germany.&quot;     This is very satisfactory, so far as it goes, and there is no doubt that the submarine attacks have greatly strengthened the already widely-felt hostility to Germany and opened many previously blind eyes.   , There is also a growing feeling, as expressed by one o   the speakers that, as he said, peace will not be signed in Spain and that those who take no active part in the war will receive no fees at the end of it.     And events in America and Russia have greatly stimulated the pro-Entente sympathies of the Spanish democrats who recognise now moro clearly than ever that the war is a world-struggle between their ideals and a German ideal which is their antithesis and enemy.     This many of the speakers emphasised. But in Spain that ground ia very dangerous ground and, in spite of the text of the resolutions, the tone of the meeting was more anti-dynastic than pro-Entente.

In that faot lies the danger.     It cannot be supposed that such speeches as those of Senor Lerroux and others can fail to produce irritation and perhaps alarm in Court oiroles.     And, as both Maura and Lerroux from their opposite points of view, have gone out of their way to insist on the personal power of the King and the insign-nlfioence of Ministers, it is obvious that the feelings of the Court are not a negligible faotor.     In their way the Spanish friends of the Entente are a weakness as well as a strength.     Their speeches may not do much harm as regards England which is, after all, a Monarchy.     But they stir up afresh the suspicions against Republican France which exist in all Spanish minds, on account of the Tangier question, and more particularly in clerical and Court circles on account of the Republican constitution and anti-clerioal policy of France.    And things are not made easier by the fact that some members of the present French Government, M. Fainleve for instance, have been mixed up in the past with Spanish questions, even domestic questions, in a manner very unfavourably viewed by the Court.

All this hampers movement towards the side x&gt;f the Entente; and the acoession of Senor Dato to the Premiership, whioh is an-nounced as these words are Vising written, is not likely to produce any great, or at any rate immediate ohange in the foreign policy of Spain.     It is true that, as was pointed out last week, he at once came forward, at the time of Maura&apos;s speech, to point out that Maura did not speak for the Conservative party, and to dissociate himself pointedly from what Maura had said in particular about Tangier and Gibraltar.     But it is perhaps notable that Senor Sanchez de Toca, who took an even more pro-Ally line about Maura&apos;s speech, . has oontinued, by choice or otherwise, to stand outside the Ministry, and Senor Dato will probably not go further in a pro-Ally direction than in being more friendly in matters of negotiation

than Sonor Garcia Prietc began at any rate by being.     Even he had changed his attitude a little of late, possibly under the influence of the discovery that several of the Allies, inoluding the newest, have means of putting pressure on Spain if they choose.

The Maurist party are naturally disappointed at the solution of the crisis, as it shows that Maura&apos;s speech, which was a bid for power, has failed of effect.     But this protest is not likely to   produce any result.     Some pro-German papers demanded Maura&apos;s return to office.     But the truth is that Maura&apos;s arroganoe and authoritative temper have made him intolerable to the politicians as well as to the King himself.

Outside the political crisis the most notable thing in recent Spanish politics is the active movement towards a rapprochement with Portugal, fostered in the Press by Senor Lorenze, who has been thought a pro-German but himself declares that he neither is now ever was one.      The remarkable words used by the King about Portugal, the honours bestowed by him upon Dr. Costa, the Portuguese Prime Minister, during his recent visit to Spain, and the concessions made to Portugal in the matter of exports of food, which have caused disturbances, all point to a seriously-pursued policy. But there does not seem any reason to suppose that, even if German intrigue be behind it, it is likely to result in anything affecting British influence in Portugal.
