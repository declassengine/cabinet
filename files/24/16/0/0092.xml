Your 36080. M.0. June 13th.    Withdrawal of all troops with exception of garrisons of posts and &quot;bridgeheads to foot of hill 8 west bank of Struma completed by June 13th, as reported in my telegram No. G.C0 246.

Admission to casualty clearing station and hospitals for malaria PoILC,  and trench fever during last 4 weeks 13,6 per 1,000 or? deducting relapses 5.4 per 1,000, during corresponding period last year admissions were 5.2 per 1,000. #or enterij   cases during last 4 weeks .19 per 1,000. During corresponding period last year .4 per 1,000.

At this time last year the army had only begun to move to the Struma valley and there were no troops on the Vardar side; the situation therefore is more hopeful, but the fever season is only just beginning, but improved arrangements for dealing with oases will help to alleviate the situation.
