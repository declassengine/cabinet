Any further communication on this subject should be addressed to 

The Secretary,

Ministry of Shipping,

St. James&apos;s Park,

London, S.W. 1, and the following number quoted..

Sir,

In continuation of my letter of the 8th

instant I am directed by the Shipping Controller to report for the information of the War Cabinet as follows:-

the month of May are now available and are of special interest as shewing the offoct of the policy of direct control of the movements of shipping coupled with the restriction of non-essential imports.    I am to enclose a memorandum which has been submitted to the Controller by the Port and Transit Executive Committee showing, as a percentage, the comparison between lay 1917 and lay 1916 in shipping tonnage entered at United Kingdom ports and the quantities imported of food, raw materials and manufactured goods.

The policy of prohibition of the import of less essential commodities began to have a marked effect in February last, and a comparison made between the figures for January 1917 and May 1917 shews

The figures of tonnage and cargo entrances for

Increase per cent

Rubber 10

Total other than food* 10

Total including food 4

A similar comparison in weights gives the following figures :~

Tons Tons

Grain and flour 327,642

Other food 47,248

All foods 280,394

Iron Ore 100,885

Cotton &amp;c. 92,298

Paper etc. 9,743

Wood and Timber 152,928

Manures &amp;c* 5,662

Rubber 847

Total other than food 176,768

Total including food 103,626

The result is that there has been a net increase in the imports of all articles of 103,626 tons although the tonnage entrances shew a reduction by 10 per cent, in other words, the prohibition of bulky articles such as timber and cotton has added substantially to the dead weight carrying power of the ships in grain and ore.

A


A statement is also attached showing the imports and shipping entrances for May 1917 compared with the figures for May 1914.   It will he seen from the statement that so far as shipping entrances are concerned 49 ships only are available as compared with 100 in times of peace, and with 70 inj&amp;y 1915 and 65 in 2-fey 1916.

The carrying capacity of the ships per 100 tons of entrances compares as follows :-

Under peace conditions 98 Average in 1915 122 &quot;       &quot; 1916 131

The enclosed statement shows the improvement which has taken place in the discharge of stores week by week in tho Northern French ports.
