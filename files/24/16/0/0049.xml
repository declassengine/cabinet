ii.O.st of the hotels had agreodjnot to provide accommodation f0&gt; &apos;the. delegates, and at one largo hotel I was given a list of -frail-known Pacifist who had had thoi* bookings cancelled t and another twenty who had called on Saturday had been refused rooms.   Later in the evening the police, I understand, informed the hotel prepriotora that they could not refuse to accommodate reaoeptabie persona who applied for rooms, and so they gave way and tobx some of the stranded delegates in. It is rumoured that tile propr 1 etora * took them in*? in another sense, by charging them extra pricoa for their accommodation!

i Robert Smillio, President of the Miners * Federation

of\Great Britain, wad in.the Chair,.and there was an audience* including delegates and visitors  of about 3,oo0* The conference should havo been bold in tho &amp;lbort Hall, but the |*id(|l^i^*bre cancelled the engagement .on Friday, and so the &apos;Golieeum, a picture house,:,;was obtained for the Conference 

ylfl I* v/aa obvious from the. start that the Conference

Was peeked with delegates .whose anti-Jritish sentiments and rotes could-be relied on by the prombtors of the Conference* isVen tho &quot;platform&quot; was more revolutionary, then usual. $T  C.!

the tone and purpose of the&apos;Conference, end Its probable effects upon the futuro prosecution of the war, and the troub3.es and diffioultios it is likely to oause at home and abroad*

In the first place the Conforenco was organised by persona who have been, and still are, very strongly opposed to the Allied cause.   They do not agree with tho Allies that the Central Powers are responsible for this War, and thoy declare that tho aims of the Allies are aggressive and Imperialistic. The war is, we are told, boing prolonged for the purpose of realising those imperialistic aims of tho British Government. Mr. Roden Buxton, speaking at Oldham on May 19th, said that the only obstacle to peace now was&apos;tho British Government. Mr  Snowden suggested to the Conference on Sunday that we were fighting to got 400,000 miles of now territory in Africa. These views aro believed by the followers of the I.l.P. leaders, and there can bo no doubt regarding the bitterness of feeling they display towards this country&apos;s war aims, as thus interpreted for thorn by Messrs. Macdonald, Snowden, Anderson, Roden Buxton, E. D. Morel, and others who provide the rank and file with opinions and &quot;facts&quot; against the war.

The Russian Revolution has, it is believed, provided the Pacifists with an opportunity for ending the war on the lines desired by the Union of Democratic Control and its allied organisations.   It ic not the Revolution in Russia, per se, that is the oause of this I.L.P. and U..D.C. jubilation and congratulation of the revolutionaries.   When the revolution took place and it was reported in our Press that the revolutionaries desired a more vigorous prosecution of the war against the Central Powers, the organisers of the Leeds Conference said the revolution would be valueless if it did not mean the end of the war so far as Russia was ooncerned.   In this connection the article by E. I). Morel in April issue on the U.D.C. is worth recalling; also the articles by Messrs* 2vlacdonald and Snowden in the &quot;Forward&quot; and the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; and Fairchilda article in &quot;The Call&quot;.     Those articles all show that the promoters of tho Leedo Conference are interested in the Russian Revolution because thoy hope to oxploit It for their own ends, and to further their agitation against the Alliod cause. The demands of the Extremists in Russia have given great satisfaction to the Pacifists here, and it is with those oxtromists th&lt; are now associated, and they aro trying to influence them to make demands which, if concedod, will be as favourable to Germany as they are unfavourable and disastrous to the Allies.

The spooches made at Leeds, particularly the one by Macdonald in moving the first resolution congratulating the Russian people on the Revolution, implied that the British Government and the supporters of the war, when they express approval of the Russian Revolution, are not sincere, and are only doing so because, as Macdouald put it, they are &quot;compelled to be glad&quot;.   It was also suggested that the Government cannot oppose tho Socialists and Pacifists doing sincerely what it is doing insincerely and under compulsion.    In   Pacifist circles and among the personal friends of Macdcnald it is said that the


British Government is strongly opposed to the Russian Revolution and is intriguing for its defeat and the return of the Romanoffs^

The Revolution in Russia,has, we are told, given us the chance of doing likewise, as one speaker put it.     11 Now the war is on, now is your chance&quot;, said Liac&amp;onald;    and this was the advice of every speaker,     Donyt wait until the war is Ql-gPy. &quot;begin the revpluti on now.     This advice was wildly&quot; cheered and red handkerchiefs .were waved by the revolutionaries. Mrs. Montefiore, of the B.S.P., appeared to think the revolution she advocated for this country could not be carried out without a struggle and some amount of bloodshed, but she said the loss of. one&apos;s own life in such a cause was nothing - though she congratulated the COs. on refusing; to fight.     I-any C Os. appear   to have only conscientious objections to the taking of German lives, and would gladly take the lives of some of their own countrymen in a revolution.     Mrs,. liontefiore also desired this, revolution to sweep away British Imperialism, for, she   said, &quot;every word spoken against Russian Imperialism applied equally to British Imperialism.&quot;     These remarks were repeated by most of the speakers and were always received with loud applause by delegates and visitors,     A visitor from another planet, unfamiliar with the causes and conditions of this war, had he been at the Leeds conference, would .have come to the conclusion that the .Allied Powers were very aggressive, and that the British Government was the most reactionary, wicked and tyrannical government in the world to-day, .and that the best and kindest people on earth were the people so often referred to by speakers and delegates as &quot;our German comrades*&quot;

Phillip Snowden moved the resolution on the &quot;War Aims&quot;, and in doing-so he explained the Russian meaning of the phrase &quot;without annexation and indemniiies&quot; ,      This Russian demand is,  of course, one that has been insisted upon by all the anti-war socialists -in the Allied countries since the war began, and it has been advocated &quot;by those American social:.sts who ai-e opposed to the Allies.     It is not a new proposal to anyone who is f ami liar with the peculiar point of view of these extreme Marxist socialists *      It means, according to Snowdon, that all territories acquired by military conquest during the war shall be returned - or equivalents - at the end of the war.      It also implies,, we were t old &gt; the restoration,, if desired, of the complete ^ndgpendence of. Ireland,  India and Egy^pt.     It-is rather curious&quot;-to note at these conferences that~Britain is regarded as the culprit, and nothing is said as to what Germany should return.-*     On the question of indemnities Pairchild said that there was equal liability for damage in the invaded territories and all, the &quot;belligerents should contribute, equally to the material restoration of the devastated territories.     Pairchild was also concerned about having a &quot;place in the sun&quot;,  and he wants this &quot;place in the sun&quot; to be secured for Germany inthe peace terms.     There is one thing we may thank Pairchild for:    h c does^ not _at t emy t to dlsffliise,his_^ro-Geriiian.i.sm      The only trouble over this resolution was when Captain Tupper actually proposed that Germany should pay an indemnity to tho torpedoed merchant seamen or their dependents.-    The delegates were shocked and


4-

grieved at euch a proposal, and they created such an uproar that Tupper had to sit down.     If there was to be any indecuiity for the men submarined, the ship-owners must pay it, and not &quot;our German comrades&quot;.     Councillor Shinwell, of Glasgow, was, very furious with Tupper and Would hear nothing of his proposal, I heard two lady Pacifists discussing this incident afterwards and they said it would Toe unreasonable to demand an indemnity from Germany for the ships she hod sunk, as submarining of these ships Was merely an act of Warfare, and, after all, were we not doing Worse things, we were trying to starve the German people by our blockade!

Tom, Mton also supported the revolution, and r&amp;ade p. revolutionary speech encling with the declaration that if the conference passed the resolutions on the ^agenda, and did not trouble too much about the nicetied of definition they would, when once they got their machinery set up, soon &quot;cook their goose for them11 ,

The resolution on Civil Liberties moved by A.G. Antnon was carried after a few speeches had been made by denouncing the Government for depriving everyone of freedom to do as thoy liked in wartime.     Amnion in a rather bitter and violent speaker, and he made us feel that we were living under frightful oppression.     Councillor Scrimgeour (Dundee), the Temper-ance advocate, followed and made one of his very intemperate speeches and suggested that the delegates should prove that they were in earnest in their demands by going to Victoria Square that night to hold an open air meeting in defiance Of the authorities, and he invited the.Pacifist M,Ps. on the platform to lead the way.     Mr. Scrimgeour is a member of the Dundee branch of the N.C.]?. and is a perfect fanatic.

The resolution proposing the setting up of Workmen1s and Soldiers1 Councils was the most important proposal of the conference.     There was some doubt as to whether this proposal would be carried without a good deal of opposition as it was rumoured that a number of delegates were going to oppose it, I heard these difficulties discuosed, before the conference met, by Tom Mann and other delegates.     They agreed that this , resolution was the resolution of the conference, and if it was not carried, or was weakened by any amendment, the conference would be a failure, as the other resolutions were merely the expression of pious opinions.

Anderson moved the resolution in a strong speech* I have often heard Anderson speak* but have never seen him so excited and so revolutionary.     There was no real opposition to the resolution.     The reports in some of the papers of opposition from J,T. Toole, of Manchester, are scarcely correct,     Toole is a revolutionary socialist and is in the N.O. ogitation in Manchoster,     Kis critisism was respecting tahe formation of a new organisation - the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers1 Councils - and suggested that existing organisations should be combined and do the work proposed in the resolution. What Toole feared was that these local Councils would attract the attention of the authorities too much, and as there &quot;are thousands of &apos;Alex Gordons&apos; in the country&quot;, authorities


would aoon learn of everything the Councils were doing- He also advised that the male member a of the Councils should be over military age_, or otherwise they would be liable to removal by the military authorities  Toole was quite in favour of the scheme, but he wanted a more careful consideration of &quot;the difficulties&quot; and he complained that the leaders on the platform had not given the rank and file a clear lead.

Similar criticism was made by IToah Ablett of the South ?ales Miners.     It was Ablett, I believe, who said that it was necessary ttf organise the soldiers in conjunction with the workers, so that when *she revolution began the soldiers could not be used against the revolutionaries, and might even help the workers to overthrow the whole social system.     This was cheered by the. delegates, and this view undoubtedly expresses the intentions of the prouoters of the movement.   The Clyde workers1 delegates wanted the scheme to be linked v/ith the Shop Stewards and the Workers1 Committees, and it was stated by SLaoManus, I believe, that the eight men arrested in connection with the recent strikes would not have been released but for the fact 11 the industrial solidarity of the workers all over the country.

It is worth noting that Cassidy, of Coventry, another of the eight men released, was appointed as a delegate to the Leeds Conference, but owing to the report on the Friday night that the meeting had been cancelled, he did not go.

There can be no doubt on the part of any one who is familiar with the aims and desires of the persons responsible for the Leeds Conference that it is intended to lead, if possibleto a revolution in this country.     With this object in view all sections of malcontents, socialists, syndicalists, strike leaders, pacifists, pro-Germans, conscientious objectors and anarchists, have all combined and have sunk their own differences,&apos; and in forming Workman&apos;s and Soldiers1 Councils all over the country they hope to organise a revolutionary movement in which the soldiers will support the extremists who are now the cause of strikes End other internal difficulties in the country.     In linking up this movement with the army they recognise the truth of Le Eon*s statement in the &quot;Psychology of Revolution&quot; that no revolution can be a success unless the army is at least neutral*     They recognise that the suborning of the army will be both difficult and dangerous, and J*.Cotter, of Liverpool - a colleague of Tom Mann | ||f conversation after the conference said that when they got to work with the soldiers there would be some espionage in the army. Some of the delegates believe, or hava been told, that if the workers in the Allied countries will agree to &quot;down tools&quot; to end the war, the German comrades will also &quot;down tools&quot; in Germany;|| but - the German socialists want to be sure that the workmen in the Allied countries will do it before they can act, I believe the leaders are encouraging this view, and I found, during conversation with people I.met, that this story of a general international strike to end tho war was being widely circulated.

It was also stated by Robert Williams that the- War legislation of the Government was not required to win the war, but was passed for the sole purpose of controlling and enslaving the workers after the., war.        Anderson suggested the same.

It is a fact that/every meeting addressed &quot;by these people the workers are assured that the labour measures passed for war purposes are (1) not passed to help the prosecution of the war, and (2) they will not he repealed at the end ef the war. These statements are &quot;believed hy hundreds of workmen, and t&amp;ey are the cause of a good deal of had feeling and district which exists at the moment.   And unless steps are taken as aarly as possible to counteract the effect      these statements, and to stop the treasonable activities of the rpersons and -societies responsible for the Leeds Conference, and for recent strikes of engineers, there can &quot;be no reasonable doubt of very serious trouble in this country at on early date;  tii.e^e troubles being made evan greater by the international ta.vjbl ^ xhsse same persons and societies are likely to create.     It ie l&amp;oar-a i:Lve that their influence for mischief should not be underestimated by the Government
