Extract from Letter from Sir R. Paget, Copenhagen to Lord Hardinge, dated May 21st, 1917.

I saw a report some days ago that the Americano have got so-called one-man submarines and it has struck me that if these hove sufficient radius or could be brought somewhere near here by a parent ship, they would be the very thing for these shallow waters and could probably slip through the mines.     There are also German patrol &quot;boats and armed trawlers to be attacked in the Cattegat.     But of oourse these are things of which I know very little and I merely offer the suggestion.

Andersen told me yesterday that the very optimiotio tone, which the German Legation here had assumed about a fortnight ago, ia gradually disappearing again.

I do not think this aspect of the question i3 realised by the Press at home.    The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot; have been particularly bad.
