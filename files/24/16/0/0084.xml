RKo^I^IinG OF LABOUR FROM ABROAD.

Copy of letter from the Secretary, Ministry of Lab our to the Secretary, War Cabinet, datecT 18th June 19l7&gt;;

(Circulated with reference to the Memorandum by thei Minister of Labour &lt;on the Recruiting .of Labour ftOm Abroad, dated 8th Jtuae 1917 (G.T01# |U ).

Lear Sir Maurice Hankey,

The Minister is exceedingly anxious that the question of recruiting foreign labour for work in this country dealt with in his Memorandum of the 8th Jv_ne should be gabled as soon as possible, as the confusion and difficulty caused by the present f.ack of system is increasing almost daily.

Further complications have now arisen csv/ijig to the fact that the Explosives Department of the Ministry of Munitions have, through the Foreign Office, been conducting certain negotiations with the French Government regarding the recruiting of labour in Portugal without any reference to this Department. |W

These arrangements apparently contemplated that the British Government should be excluded from recruiting in northern Portugal.   This may have bean quits satisfactory from the point of view of the Ministry of Munitions, but it is quite wrong from our point of &quot;view inasmuch as tna labour we are recruiting, viz: for timber cutting, can only be obtained in adequate numbers in the rfoz:.tl*i flf Portugal, the very area from which it was contemplat94:vtihat British effort should be excluded^

And, inasmuch &amp;s the men whom the Explosives Depart-me^-^J the Ministry were labourers fora     factory the construction of which has now been dropped whereas we need timber fellerfc, the net result of the negotiations would appear to ihev.that, in order to get something they do not now require, they have precluded us from getting something which we do require very badly for saving tonnage.

Yours sincerely,

fSd) E0J. Shackleton^
