Prom:- General Barter. G.Q.G. Russia. 9.6,17. To:-     C.I.G.S, . 8.2 p.m.

This morning the new Commander in Chief received heads of (Groups apparently omitted ) strictly in confidence he informed us of his definite intention to attack on every front in Europe between June 23rd and June 28th (our style) if possible, or at latest between June 28th and July 3rd; offensive will begin on south wost front and -rill follow at intervals of a few days on other fronts including Roumanian front.

He says that he could not guarantee success, as much depended on moral of the troops, which was not yet altogether reliable though considerably improved.

Some of chiefs of missions complained at the interview of not being sufficiently taken into the confidence of the General Staff and that information given them was meagre.

I afterwards had a private interviewV.-ith Brusilov. He Bp most cordial and assured me that at earliest possible moment I should have fullest information on all matters.

I said that I knew that the British representative had hitherto enjoyed full confidence of Commander-in-Chief and that I hoped that he would trust me in same way.

Brusilov expressed hope that with initiation Russian offensive Franco British offensive would not cease.    I said that I felt sure that plans had been made to support by indirect action in Prance any Russian success but that in view of conditions existing in Russia it was possible that the nature and extent of such support would depend on immediate result of Russian offensive itself.

I said further that there could be (no) doubt but that allies would be most ready to help Russia should she by a   success at beginning of offensive show that close and concerted cooperation would help common cause.

I also added that in my opinion knowledge that success on this side would receive sympathetic support on our (Groups apparently omitted) do much before actual offensive began to  stimulate Russian troops.

Although previously obvious that this point .was one on which Brusilov did not care to say much, it is equally evident that he would be most grateful for any actian which would prevent the Germans from transferring troops from west front to Russian.

Mesopotamia.    Brusilov informed me that he had carefully considered situation in the Caucasus.

General Yudenich whose health had broken was in his opinion no longer energetic enough and he was going to sugge-et-for the post another general who was in favour of an early and energetic offensive.

He was aware  f th  difficulties of supply (and) climate but all the same he was gaing to take acti n during summer even if there could not be a forward push on a large scale.

At present he did not desire to give any guarantee but he assures me that he has telegraphed explicit orders that, no inch of ground was to be ceded in the Caucasus.

We discussed question of Pavlof&apos;s forces taking offensive, but for the present he did not see much chance of this. I fear therefore that for the moment proposed advanc-e on .Kerkuk has been abandoned.

I referred to advisability in view of advance of establishment of depot units of supply between Kermanohah and Hamadam, but Brusilov said that lines of communication with Russia did not permit of the accumulation of supplies.

The Persians exacted payment in Persian gold in so far as supplies from Persia were concerned:     this had been minted at Petrograd but the works had been broken down beyond repair,       I asked whether Persians would take Indian or English gold, and he is telegraphing to find out*

He says that in the Caucasus up to date great slackness has been evidenced in the matter of making suitable lines of communication especially railways.

He will have this work pushed forward with greatest energy in future.
