June 7, 1917.

By the terms of Art, 9 of the Treaty of April 26th, 1915, Great Britain, France and Russia recognised that in the event of the total or partial partition of Turkey in Asia, Italy should receive an equitable share in the country bordering the province of Adalia, and that the a one to be attributed to Italy shtfutd be eventually defined taking into account the already existing Interests of Great Britain and France in that region.

In October 1916 documents were Communicated to the Italian* M.F-A. shewing the agreements which had been reached between Great Britain, France and Russia regarding their respective zones and spheres of. interest in Asia Minor, and various discussions ensued between these three Powers and Italy regarding the sphere which should be attributed to the latter according to the terms of Article 9 of the Treaty of April 26th., 1915.

No conclusion having been arrived at, the matter was further debated at the Conference of the Allies held at St. Jean de Mauri-enne on April 19th, . 1917, at which the Prime Ministers of G&apos;r&apos;eat Britain, France and Italy and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs were present.

As the result of this Conference the British and French Prime Ministers undertook to submit to their respective Governments the claims of the Italian Government in Asia Minor, based upon a map which was introduced at the discussion.    (A reproduction of this map, which was drawn roughly and which must be subject to accurate delimitation, is attached hereto;    the Italian sphere is therein coloured green and the Italian sphere of influence is marked &quot;C&quot;).   An exchange of views also to&amp;k. place as to the situation which might result for the Allied Powers at the moment i,f peace with regard to the Ottoman Empire, and a formula was agreed to in this connection.

His Majesty&apos;s G-mvernment, after carefully considering the conclusions of the Conference at St. Jean de Maurienne which:&apos;were duly laid before them by Mr Lloyd-George, agree conditionally- to the zones |f occupation and of interest respectively %o be attri-* buted to Italy as defined at that Conference and as shown in the annexed map.

The agreement of His Majesty&apos;s Government is, however, subject to the following conditions

(1) That the consent of the Russian Government be first obtained.

(2) That Smyrna, if eventually ceded to Italy, shall be a free-port.

(3) That Italy make   efeR-r-!^^BNPeased effort to

co-operate with wk&quot;^H(i f8 ^n arm3 against the common enemy,&apos;;C^&apos;l|^iure of such ef-; fort to be determi^^^^iier consultation-between the General B%%tf&quot;3 of the Allies.


It is further understood: 

(1) That the interests of the other Powers already established in the different zones shall be scrupulously respected, but that the Powers concerned in these interests shall nbt make use of them as a means of political action* and

(2) That if at the time when peace is declared, the total cr partial possession of the territories contemplated in the agreements come to between Great Britain, France, Italy and Russia, as to the disposal cf a part of the Ottoman Empire, cannot be fully accorded to one or more of these Powers, then the interests of the Powers concerned will be again taken into equitable considerations having regard to the efforts made by each of the Powers in the war.
