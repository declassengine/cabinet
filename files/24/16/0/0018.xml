SECRET.

Minute by Secretary of State for India.

I circulate to the Cabinet a telegram from the Viceroy, and the paragraph of my private letter of the 2ud May to which it refers.

The Cabinet will see that the Viceroy&apos;s difficulties are increasing. They will he further increased by the publication oE the Mesopotamia Commission Report; for this will show that Indian Administration is not only non-popular, but that on the military side it has been grossly inefficient.

I know how heavily Members of the Cabinet are worked, but I feel bound to press for a very early discussion and decision.

12th June 1917.

Telegram from Viceroy, dated Uth June 1917.

Private. Your Home Department telegram of 22nd May. Constitutional Reforms. The position here is becoming increasingly difficult owing to my inability to make any authoritative announcement of policy. Bombay, Punjab both pressing us for an authoritative statement as to how to deal with Home Rule. Lord Pentland and Sir M. O&apos;Dwyer have made statements, and other Local Governments most uncertain&apos;what to say. I would urge you to make an announcement on lines of paragraph 10 of your private letter of 2nd May, if His Majesty&apos;s Government do not see their way to sanctioning the announcement suggested in our Home Department telegram of 18th May.

Extract from Private Letter from Mr. Chamberlain to the Viceroy, dated 2nd May 1917.

I am myself tending strongly to the conclusion that if we are to make a declaration as to the goal of our policy, it would be worse than useless to invent any elaborate formula. It seems to me that once we undertake to define our goal we can say nothing but that it is ,the development of free institutions with a view to ultimate self-government. If such a declaration is to be made and I am coming round to your view that a statement of our object is necessary then I think it should be accompanied by a very clear declaration that this is a distant goal, and that anyone who pretends that it is realisable to-day or in the early future is no friend.to Government and no friend to India herself. I think, too, that we should have to assert plainly that the rate of progress and the times and stages by which it is to be reached must be controlled and decided by His Majesty&apos;s Government. Sinha, with whom I have talked freely as you desired me to do, would, I believe, accept this condition. But it is quite plain that neither would he be satisfied himself nor does he think any other section of Indian opinion would be satisfied with less. After all we must take account of the changes produced by this war, of the constant emphasis laid upon the fact that the Allies are fighting for freedom and nationality, of the revolution in Russia, and the way it has been hailed throughout Europe and America, and of the effect of all these things on Indian opinion and on our own attitude to Indian questions. What would have seemed a great advance a little time ago, would now satisfy no one, and we must, I think, be prepared for bold and radical measures.
