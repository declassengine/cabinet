INDIAN BULLETIN No. 8.

EXPLANATORY NOTES.

1. New Formations. No farther progress is reported in .the completing of the 13 Indian battalions raised to take the place of the Indian battalions sent to Mesopotamia. Eight of these are now complete and the remainder within 025 men of completion. Regarding labour battalions the Government of India have telegraphed that they have recruited close on 25,000 men and that they expected to raise 10,000 shortly. They also enquired whether the balance to make up 50,000 would be required. They have been informed that further recruitment of labourers and woodcutters should be suspended as there are no ships available for their transportation to France.

2. Munitions. The Munitions Board is developing schemes for the production of material essential to shell production and other forms of war munitions. Sir Frederick Black has proposed a scheme which, if successfully carried out, would quadruple the output, but only after 18 months. A modified scheme of adaptation and improvement of existing factories would double the present output for about one-fourth the cost and be productive four or five months after receipt of plant. Full weekly output would then be 16,000 complete rounds of shrapnel or high explosives, which could be increased to 20,000 complete rounds within a further two or three months, The Government of India recommend the adoption of the smaller scheme as the more practicable in regard to the early additional assistance from Indian factories. vlg*

4. Internal Condition. The Santals in Bihar and Orissa who rose on account of misrepresentation regarding the recruitment for labour in France interrupted railway communication and cut the telegraph line, but offered no  opposition to the troops called out, and the locality is now quiet.

he has been requested to suspend further enquiries. Rising of Santals occurred in Mayurbhanj State in Bihar and Orissa apparently result of misrepresentation of Government&apos;s intentions in regard to Labour Corps for France. Details not received, but rising seems to have been suppressed without much trouble and locality is now quiet. Political crime quiescent save for serious (corrupt group) dacoity Calcutta, in which jeweller&apos;s shop looted with loss of life. Subscriptions to War Loans continue to come in fairly satisfactorily. Indian Volunteering, Indian Defence Force, remain negligible.
