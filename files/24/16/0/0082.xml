Report to the Cabinet.

A.B. 153/20. 16th June, 1917.

General 1, The Board-have had before them during this

Policy.

week the additional requisitions of the Maval and Military Air Services for aeroplanes and seaplanes, framed with a view to utilising the unalloted output facilities of the country up to the 3ist [December next. As was shown in the report to the Cabinet dated 12th May, the number of engines on order for delivery up to&apos;the 31st December at that time considerably exceeded the number of aeroplanes.   It was explained in that report that it was not neoessary to place orders for aeroplanes so far in advance as orders for engines, and that further orders for aeroplanes would be issued.when new types of machines had been decided upon.

Since the date of the above report a decision has been taken to adopt a new design of Sopwith single-seater fighter to take the 200 h.p. stationary      engine, in preference to the French Spad machine which was the alternative, and large orders for this aeroplane, which is known as the Sopwith &quot;Dolphin&quot;, are in course of

Ibeing placed. It has also been decided to order 1,000 De Havilland 4 machines.   This aeroplane has hitherto been used as a fighter reconnaissance machine, but it also satisfies the requirements laid down for a long distance, bomber, Carrying a restricted load. Accordingly -1-


700 of the above 1,000 will be slightly modified so as to/ Starve as long distanoo bombers and will provide material for an interim bombing programs, pending the production of a specially designed long distance bomber, whioh could not be available till early next year.

2. The Board have had before them the minutes of the recont discussion at the war Cabinet with referenoe to the aerial policy and have discussed the general question of the increase of the faolliti es for manufacturing giroraft, with a view to supplying information to the Cabinet if required,

3, The Board have had under prolonged consideration the problem of the relations whioh should exist between the Advisory Committee for Aeronautics and the Air Board, and the question oonneoted therewith of the treatment of aeronautical inventions.   a letter has now been addressed to the Treasury, after consultation with lord Rayleigh and Sir Hichard Glazebrook, proposing that the Advisory Committee for Aeronautics should become the Advisory Committee to the Air Board.   Under the Board&apos;s proposal the composition of the Committee would, at any rate for the time being, remain as

at present. Any further appointments to it would be made by the President of the Air Board after consultation with Lord Hay1sigh.

The Advisory Committee would consider suoh matters as thoy thought fit or were referred to it by the Air Board, but before undertaking investigations at the National Physical Laboratory, would satisfy themselves as to the general  oncurrenoe of the Air Board in the value of the proposed investigation.

The Inventions Committee would he selected from among the members of the Advisory Committee, and would consider and report upon all aeronautical inventions submitted for consideration.   It is thought that the reference of inventions to a body exercising an independent judgments on their merits will conduce to public confidence to a greater extent that their referenoe to a section of a Government department.

No change is proposed in the relations of the Advisory Committee to the aeronautical section of the National Physical Laboratory for the moment.   It is understood that the status, of the National Physical Laboratory is under consideration by the Government and the question may arise hereafter as to a modification of the existing financial arrangements under which the work of th?e Laboratory is cafried on,

4. The attention of the Board has been drawn,

on more than one occasion, by manufacturers to tho importance of maintaining the interest of workers in airoraft factories in the highly important, but generally monotonous, work on which they are employed. Engaged as they frequently are on the production by a repetition process of some small part of an aeroplane, these men and women find it difficult to realise that they are contributing effectively to one of our most valuable instruments of warfare.   The Board accordingly arranged some time ago, with the assistance of Sir David Henderson and General Trenchard, that Lieutenant Swart, fl.F.C. known as a writer by the name of Boyd Cable, should

~3~


visit various squadrons at tho iVont and gather materials and photographs tor lectures conoerning the exploits performed with various types of aircraft, for dolivery to the work people engaged on the manufacture of those particular types.

Lieutenant Bwart has now delivered his first series of lectures which, judging from the reports reoolved from the factories concerned, have proved a very great success. 5; 3upnly.

Deliveries of engines and aeroplanes have &quot;been as follows :-

Engines,. Aeroplanes. Total for week to 9th June TCT 869

Total for month to date 167 269

Total for May 1917 853 1202

Total for May 19i6 270 304

In addition to the above figures 3 engines and 3 aoroplanes have been delivered from Prench builders.

8 seaplanes were delivered in the week ending 9th June.

Hote.        The totals for month to date do not include June 1st and 2nd.
