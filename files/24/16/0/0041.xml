WEEKLY REPORT OH FRANCE. Ill June 14. 1917.

All information reosived since last week confirms the impression that the debates in the Chamber and the Senate constituted a striking personal victory for M. Ribot and his Cabinet. There does not appear to be any doubt that the courage and decision shewn by the Government have cleared the Parliamentary air, and though experience shows that in that air storms arise very quickly and very unexpectedly, still for the moment the political barometer has certainly gone a point or two nearer to &quot;set fair&quot;.     Public opinion has been steadied by the speeches of the Prime Minister, the unanimity of the Senate, and the significant fact that after disagreeing among themselves as to a resolution of their own, even the disappointed Socialists of the Chamber finally voted in large numberjj, (39 out of 96) in favour of the resolution accepted by the Government.     And this in spit^ of the fact, which we know privately, that in having to refuse them their passports for Stockholm the Government had been largely influenced by their great aversion, M. Briand.

The only rift in the Parliamentary lute is a certain difference between the tone of the Chamber and the Senate.     In the Chamber the Order of the Day as originally prepared received certain additions intended to gratify the Socialists and to secure the unanimous vote which M. Ribot so much desired and so nearly obtained. These added phrases gave M. Rene-udel, the leader of the Majority Socialists, who himself voted with the Government, the chance of covering up the repulse of his party over the Stockholm affair by

saying in his speech and asserting in his paper L&apos;Humanite, that the text of the order of the Day as finally adopted constituted a viotory for their views and that they would all have voted for it if the Government had not put its veto on the Stockholm visit. He takes the phrase &quot;direot expression of the sovereignty of the French people&quot; whioh the Chamber applied to itself, as an intended slight to the Senate and, what seems further fetched, a condemnation of secret diplomacy.     He deelares that when the Order of the Day oalls upon the Government to socure its objects by the military and diplomatic oo-operation of all the Allies&quot;, it accepts by the word &quot;diplomatic&quot; the Russian demand for a revision of war aims and treaties.     This seems a great deal to find in one word. Finally he emphasizes, with more reason, the importance of the words about &quot;the organisation to be prepared at once of the society of nations&quot;.     His argument is that in this way the Socialists have obtained official sanction of the three principles which they had most at heart.

Now it is noticeable that the Senate, which voted a few hours after his article appeared, not only reasserted its own position by speaking of the &quot;Government whioh alone has the right to bind the country under the control of the Chambers&quot;,   but did not include in its Order of the Day any words which could by the subtlest ingenuity be twisted into a condemnation of secret diplomacy, or an acceptance of a revision of war aims.     It said nothing of the Society of nations but was content with recording its faithfulness to the &apos;ideal of independence and liberty for all peoples&apos;. It added to the Chamber&apos;s demand for Alsace-Lorraine, just reparation and durable guarantees of peace, a further demand for the punishment of the crimes which have been committed-     And its last

word was a call on the Government to take all suoh measures as might be necessary for the safety of the nation whether at home or abroad.     It is obvious that there is a difference of tone here.     In itself it is not of importance because there is nothing very new about it.     But there may be significance in the fact that the language of the Senate, especially the last words, which the &quot;Huraanite&quot;describes as a&quot;provocation&quot;, has led to a renewal of the old Socialist attacks of the Senate, and to a renewed demand for the sitting of the two Chambers together as a National Assembly during the war.     This proposal has already some time ago been referred by the Chamber to a special Commission who are to tudy and report on it.     Nothing is likely to come of it.     it is true that it would save the time of Ministers, which is the pretext put forward in its favouri     But most Republicans would regard it as altogether contrary to the spirit as well as the letter of the Constitution of the Republic;   and on the other hand many Socialists would dislike the reinforcement of the more moderate elements of

the Chamber by the presenoe pf the Senators.     The truth is pro&apos;s

bably that the wholi agitation, which has not been entirely confined to the &quot;Humanite&quot;, is very largely an offensive-defensive meant to retrieve the Sooialist prestige whioh has been badly damaged by the ease with which the Government refused the Stockholm passports, and, as they complained, almost ignored that question in the great debates of the Chamber and the Senate. But it may also be in part one of the symptoms of the dissatisfaction with the existing order of things of whioh rumour says so much and of v/hich the facts which happen in daylight give on the whole so little evidence.

One definite occurrence is known.     While the Chamber was debating on June 4th news came of a disturbance in the outskirts


in

-4-

of Paris in whioh one or two persons were killed.     One of them was an Annamite soldier;   and though the whold affair seems to have begun in a mere brawl, this fact led to rumours that the Government was bringing coloured troops to Paris to maintain order.     This, 11. Painleve, the Minister of T?ar, passionately denied and his speeoh had a great sucoess, so that in the end the whole incident is said to have rather helped than injured the Government.     But it once more shews the nervousness of Paris, a nervousness whioh may have been increased by the appointment of a new Prefeot of Polioe, as many people may think the change indicates that the Government expects disturbances. The truth, as reported by oareful observers, seems to be that &apos;&gt;     very little indeed has ooourred to justify the rumours which fly about Paris.     One such observer who had been told of the cavalry charges and the beginnings of fcfca Revolution could not, after a personal investigation find that anything at all serious had occurred.     The recent strikes were almost all of women and are mostly settled.     The only actual incident he oould hear of was of women attacking police who were arresting a deserter.

The real anxiety lies in that direction.     Is the temper of the Army changing?    Two or three months ago it was said to be in high spirits.     Now it is said to be feeling, like the whole country indeed, a little &quot;flat&quot;.     That would be nothing in itself;   all armies go through their ups and downs in the matter of spirits.     But it is alleged that the soldiers shew signs of war-weariness and even of discontent.     Whether this be true or not there is evidenoe in several directions that It is feared and believed.     It is inevitable that it should be more difficult to maintain a steady tone in an Army whioh consists to a very large extent of very young men and of middle-aged men with families and long settled in civil life than with the original Army

lies and long settled in civil life than with the original Army mainly composed of men in the flower of military age.     It may be only this fact that has caused the numerous allusions which have come from very different quarters to the need for maintaining the spirit of the Army.

M. Ribot in his speech to the Senate declared that the objection to suoh Meetings as the Stockholm Meeting was that they might produce in the minds of the people &quot;and what is more important, of the Army, which needs all its energies&quot;, the illusion of peace being near and the moral weakening that follows suoh illusions.     M. Herve, the converted Socialist who is now      &apos;plus roy-aliste que le roi&apos;, complains in &quot;la Victoire&quot; that the Socialist leaders, even those who have supported the war have done everything to inorease the weariness which, he says, undoubtedly and naturally exists among many of the soldiers, after the &quot;vie infernale&quot; which they have lived for three years.     He complains that the politicians instead of patiently insisting on the certainty of victory and the impossibility of peace without it, have led the minds of the men, especially those of them who are Socialists, after various visionary Wills of the Wisp, and encouraged them to excuse their natural human weakness, against which a soldier above all men, has to be on his guard4 by high-sounding international theories which make them wonder whether it is after all so necessary to fight and to conquer.     And though he does not join with the &quot;Humanite&quot;, (and certain Radical politicians behind the scenes) in demanding the presence of Deputies with the Army and generally its democratization, yet he does join with them in declaring that more must be done for the soldiers, and the reason he gives is significant.     His article is entitled &quot;Pour Le Moral Des Poilus&quot;, and the gist of it is that the soldiers must be helped to fight and endure &quot;for the few months more&quot; after which M. Herve is bold


enough to promise them their release, and that the way to help them is to shew them that the oountry and the Government feel for them. To that end M. Herve oalls for a real carrying out of General retain&apos; s new order about leave, for better arrangements for soldiers

the

when on leave, for more care about/men&apos;s food, and above all for

the promise of a franc a day to all soldiers instead of as now

only to soldiers actually in the trenches.

What action, if any, the Government will take in these

matters it is, of course, impossible to say.     But obviously they

can have few mere important problems to deal with than the temper

of the soldier.     Enquiry in well-informed quarters seems to indi-

worse

cate that as usual Paris has fancied things to be muchxnsrE5c/than they really are.     There have been no important signs of discontent among the troops and certainly no disobedience to orders. The discontent, such as it is, is believed to have grown out of the very definlteness and liberality of the official promise of leave, so many days to every man at certain intervals. Such promises , it is said, should not be made in war-time, becauue it is impossible to guarantee that circumstances v/ill not prevent their being kept, and then disappointment and disoontent inevitably follow.     This sort of disappointment, together with the absence of any very striking French victories, is probably the chief source of the symptoms which have led to the discussion.     It will have done no harm if it leads to more careful consideration of the soldiers&apos; wants and feelings.

For the rest it points to a situation which, as M. Ribot said of still greater matters, should be taken seriously but not at all tragically - It is one to watch with interest but, so far as present indications go, without alarm*
