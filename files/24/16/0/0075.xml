PROPOSAL THAT, THE MERCHANT SHIPS IN USE BE REDUCED TO 950.

MINISTRY   OP SHIPPING.

THE  SHIPPING  CRISIS:   JUNE 1917.

Proposal that the Merchant Ships in tlse be reduced to 950.

(1) It is submitted that the tonnage position, in view

of prospective losses and of the slow progress - the

necessarily slow progress - of additional shipbuilding on

both sides of the Atlantic, has become so serious that

nothing but shipping economies of a drastic character can

enable us to hold out.    It is to be feared that it is quite

unlikely that the ships available for the service of the

United Kingdom through additional British shipbuilding, plus

what we can reasonably expect as our share of American

additional shipbuilding, will reach 200,000 tons per month

until about nine months from now and may not reach 300,000

tons per month until well after the lapse of a year. let

in April we lost 496,000 tons; in May 368,000 tons and in

/J /fa &lt;nm

the first jflte3r*a days of June ^B% @g-tons.   In these

circumstances it is represented that large-scale action of

the promptest character can alone save us.

(2) Concentration in the Atlantic has been decided upon as a policy, but as things are there is no reasonable prospect of it being carried out quickly enough and drastically enough to give the security which it can actually afford if put properly into practice.   It is suggested that it can hardly be expected that those who have the actual placing of contracts for the various departments, immersed

as they are in the details of their own particular duties,

can


272

oan fully realise the grave character of the tonnage crisis. Moreover, while supplies of various commodities are actually to he obtained, even at great risk, from the ends of the world, we are naturally tempted to believe that those distant supplies are absolutely necessary, forgetful of the fact that Germany, Land-locked and blockaded in Central Europe, is waging war without a single ship upon the high seas and deprived entirely of the commodities which here are declared to be absolutely indispensable.    The course which has been actually taken is to invite the departments to transfer their buying to the North American markets and to prepare statements showing what they can do in this way without paying excessive prices.

(3)    The proposal made here is that action should take a different form.    We have left, apart from the ships allocated to war services and to our Allies, about 1,700 ocean-going vessels, in addition to the smaller boats which ply in European waters.    It is suggested that the decision should be&apos; made to employ only 950 of these vessels, in the following services:

No. of Trades. Tons of Cargo

Ships. per annum.

650 North Atlantic &amp; W.Africa ] (each carrying 5.000 tons d.w.j &amp; making 6 round voyages p.a.)) 19,500,000

150       Far Waters (3 voyages p.a.) 2,200,000

150       European Waters, apart from fully requisitioned vessels. (8 voyages p.a.) ) 6,000,000

950 Tons 27,700,000

(4)


0     (4)    Thus our imports by British vessels would be reduced to about 28,000,000 tons per annum to which, possibly, neutral vessels might add 3,000,000 tons, making a total of 31,000,000 tons, or over 2,500,000 tons per month.    This would save the situation, for it would leave a reserve of 750 vessels, including those under repair.   Also a greatly reduced number of ships would get almost as much cargo as is now obtained by all our ships.

(5)    The carrying out of this drastic revision of shipping policy would, of course, greatly contract our present sea communications with South Africa, India, Australasia, etc, but it would give security while leaving intact a substantial Imperial and foreign connection.    There yjould be a good mail service to all parts of the world, and we should be able to obtain all really indispensable commodities, such as manganese and rubber, which are not to be obtained in the North American markets.    This reversal of the method of the action at present taken has the advantage of putting it up to the buying departments to do the best they can with the means available. The real danger of the situation is that the buying departments should imagine that greater means exist than actually do exist.    Because we have the ships it is suggested that we must use .thejn, but it is contended here that such use is as unwise as though we sent into the firing line on land every man we possessed without regard to the fact that an army needs reserves.

(6)    There never was before in the history of the world such a situation as now obtains, in which the destiny of all nations depends upon the maintenance of our communications with America and with our Allies.    Those communications must be maintained or our Allies  o out of the war and America never comes into it.   Why, then, should we employ ships upon other routes, save in &apos;a very limited degree?

(7)    The danger of unnecessary lines of comnunication was pointed out by the First Sea Lord in his memorandum of April 27th entitled: f&quot;    .&quot;The Naval Situation with reference to the Submarine Danger&quot;.    He then said:-

&quot;The real fact of the matter is this.   We are carrying on the war at the present time as if we had the absolute command of the sea, whereas we have not such command or anything approaching it.   It is quite true that we are masters of the situation so far as surface ships are concerned, but it must be realised - and t&amp;alised at once - that this will be quite useless if the enemy&apos;s submarines paralyse, as they do now, our lines of communication.

History has shown from time to time the fatal results of basing naval and military strategy on an insecure line of communications.   Disaster is certain to follow and our present policy is heading straight for disaster.    It is iiseTess and dangerous in the highest degree to ignore that fact.&quot;

(8) I had not read these words when I wrote my Memorandum of May 4th urging from a shipping point of view the very considerations which the First Sea herd urged from a naval point of view.    The British and American Navies, it is clear, will have quite enough to do to protect the North Atlantic and Mediterranean routes.    To ask them to do more is to court disaster.

(9) To sum up, the suggestion made is that the War Cabinet should instruct the Ministry of Shipping to confer with the various buying departments to devise the best use that can be made of the limited number of ships referred to in paragraph (3) above, and that forthwith a report should be presented to the I7ar Cabinet showing how this actually affects both our imports and our exports, in order that all necessary stops may be taken to ease the position of Colonial exporters, to assist British exporters, and to arrange any necessary substitutions in the case of military

or


215

i

or other materials.   But promptitude is the essence of the matter, for with each day that passes the irreplaceable ships of the country diminish.    I use the term irreplaceable with intention because there is no possibility within twelve months, or fifteen months, or even longer, of raising shipbuilding to a point at which it can replace such losses as the present system invites and causes.
