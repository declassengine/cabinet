COMMITTEES ON TRADE AFTER THE WAR.-. .PUBLICATION OF REPORTS.

Bopy of letter dated 8th June,1917 from Mr. S.S. Montagu to

Sirj A7 Stanley

(Circulated at. the request of Mr. Montagu with reference to Paper G.T. 1029.)

Dear Stanley,

I am much obliged to you for the Memorandum which you communicated to me on the publication of the ReportB of Committees appointed by the Board of Trade.   It is not irrelevant nov; for me tc say that I very strongly objected to the action of the Bo8rd of Trade in publishing the appointment and the names of these Committees.   The more our enquiries on Reconstruction are kept private,  the better we shall get on, and the^ late Government, after Mr. Runciman had done this, passed a resolution in their Reconstruction Committee to that effect.

Since the formation of this Committee, however, Lord Balfour of Burleigh&apos;s Committee has been charged with advising the Government on Commercial and Industrial Policy, and those Committees have become subordinate enquiries to that Committee. It would in my opinion be disastrous to publish isolated and unco-ordinated recommendations on particular traaes as they come in, for each trade would endeavour to get as good terms as any other trade, and it would hamper very much the work of Lord Balfour of Burleigh&apos;s Committee in co-ordinating and formulating a considered and homogeneous policy for all industries.

It is no doubt true that the trades interested will clamour for the publication of the Reports.   I&apos; would answer that the Reports of these Sub-Committees, as they are now, are being considered by Lord Balfour of Burleigh&apos;s Committee on behalf of the Government, and that until this consideration is finished no useful purpose would be served by their publication.   Moreover, they would give information of great assistance to the enemy,  not only in the conduct of the war, but in preparing the necessary after-war policy.    I would do this, if I might suggest it, by means of a Question and Answer in the House of Commons.

By all means take a ruling of the War Cabinet on the (subject, but I should like to say that I was present at the War Cabinet yesterday, urging the publication of the Report cf the Whitley Committee on the Relations between Capital land Labour, and the Prime Minister, I think with the assent of his colleagues, objected to the publication of the Report Ion the very ground that the publication of such Reports was pndesirable and that if we published one, we should have to ublish others.   I made as good a case as I could for an -cception, but publication was not agreed upon, and I there-Tore think that you would have   .no difficulty in getting the support of the War Cabinet.

I hope to hear from you in a few days about Railways. &apos;r hope also to hear from you how Non-Ferrous Metals went in the Jabinet yesterday.
