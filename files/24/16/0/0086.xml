The Director of the Agricultural Section has had an interview with Gen, Tagart of the V/ar Office this week, to ask for the assistance of the Military Authorities in supplying men from the Army should civilian labour not be forthcoming in sufficient numbers to meet all demands for the Hay and Corn harvests.

Ho further indicated that thcro would be no objection on tho part of the Military Authorities to bringing tho agricultural companies up to their full strength.

The Director of the Agricultural Section is making with the Board of Agriculture suitable arrangements for tho distribution of this military labour if and when it is required. (2)   Scotland.     A similar arrangement has been suggested to tho Military Authorities in reference to the harvests in Scotland,     Should the number of men allocated to Scotland be insufficient, Gen.

(l)   A general appeal to the Country has been made for 10,000 Volunteers to assist in the hay harvest.     The appeal requests all persons willing to devote one ;/eck or upwards to this work to communicate at once with tho Local Agricultural Commissioners or National Service Committees in their own localities, and instructions havo gone out to the National


-5*

Service Committees of which there are now over 900 in existence to prosecute the appeal with all their power, (2)   School Boy Labour,

(a) Term-time work.     The reports received go to show that in many districts schools are materially assisting the farmers locally, but no figures of actual numbers are available.

(b) Holiday work.     Demands for tho service of public school boys during the holidays are already being received through the War Agricultural Executive Committees? Thirty definite demands for camps of boys have been received, absorbing about 3,000 school boys,, who are members of Officers Training Corps and will work under their own officers,.

In tho English Building Trade 54 Local Committees have now been set up and in 33 other cases preliminary meetings with a viet7 to the formation of Local Committees have been held.

mines has norr^be^m-macLe^

(h)     As a result of the^cmfB^eno^jaalx^ at St, ErminJU-^^t week in connection with the Leeds F x^yJ^^&lt;y^^ for labour, the Company, and the Yorkshire Winers1 Association have reached a settlement as regards one of the pits involved,&apos; and the Association have undertaken to do all in their power to obtain the additional miners required for this pit. A further conference is to be held as regards the other pit where difficulty had arisen*

(c) Two conferences were held during the week with representatives of the co-operative branches of the Distributing Trades. 1,200 men have how been obtained for the Army through the operation of the i!Internal Substitution&quot;&apos; scheme in the China and Earthenware Trade, and the Leek Silk Trade has formed a Joint Committee which held its first mooting on June 12th with the object of inaugurating a similar scheme in that trade, though on a much smaller scale.

(d) Local National Service Committees,     Up to June 14th there had been received 790 returns of appointment of Local National Service Committees in England and Wales out of a total of 1,055 which it is expected to set up; and 126 such returns of appointment in Scotland out of a total of 286,

S U..&apos;ST ITT3T1 OHSEC TI ON .     The returns received from Substitution Officers indicate that no large demands have been made upon them as yet, cither for substitution or reinforcement. In parts this is probably due to the fact .that tho work of the Dilution Officers is not yet sufficiently advanced to enable them to create vacancies for which substitutes mi;Jit be found, but there are other substitution cases dealt with by the Tribunals which might have been expected to reach the Substitution Officers if the Employment Exchanges have not been able to clear them.     It is obvious that the work not only of tho Substitution Officers but also of tho Trade and National Service Local Committee cannot even be be, un until demands aro made upon them.


A special call for labour has been made by the Air Board and steps have been taken to find the woodworkers required through the agency of the Woodworking and Furniture Trades Committee,     Arrangements are being made with the approval of the Air Board for the distribution and utilisation of these men.

In addition, 1,122 offers of service for domestic employment have been sent forward to the War Office (A.G.ll).

(b) Women&apos; s Land Arra^.

Definite statistics are not yet forthcoming, as no cumulative return of the numbers of offers of service made by women and dealt with by the Employment Exchanges has been made.

Approximately 4,000 women have been placed or are in training.

At a meeting of the inspectors of the Board of Agriculture

held during the current week it was reported that farmers are

adopting a changed attitude,- more favourable to the employment

of woman labour.     In consequence of this, an effort is being

made to stimulate recruiting of the -&quot;&apos;omen&apos;s Land Army. The

numbers of women offering themselves for service in the Women&apos;s&apos;
