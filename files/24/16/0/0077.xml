PETROGHAD, OQi) G.T. 1077 60U

13th June, 1917

From

Lieutenant-Colonel Blair, Petrograd.

To

D.M.I. N.R. 1165.

In place of Gurko, General Danikin has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of Western front.     Colonel Verkhovski has been appointed to command the Moscow district.

The crisis in Kronstadt seems to have again (?) settled. Provisional Government have confirmed the appointment of the Commission ohoBen by Kronstadt Council of Workmen and Deputies. The President of the Kronstadt Council has notified Provisional Government that two training ships ordered to leave Kronstadt have gone, and that as soon as necessary repairs are completed, the remainder will follow.

By a Petrograd military district order, all ranks are now permitted to wear civilian clothes, when off duty. The l)Ukrainski representatives have called on Provisional Government to issue an order as to the formation of national units at front, and on rear, and another as to autonomy for (1) ukrain.

Trouble has arisen at (2) Luga in an artillery brigade intended to join Russian troops in Franoe.   Apparently however the majority have decided to go.     As an illustration of Russian freedom, I may mention that a Workmen&apos;s Conference here, presided over by a Bolshevik, ejected from the Conference,   all representatives of the &apos;Bourgeois* Press.

NOTE.   (1) Ukrain, the Southern part of Russia inhabited by the

Little Russian. (2) Luge, a railway station halfway between Petrograd

and Pakow.
