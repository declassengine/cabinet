The following copies of letters from the Roumanian Minister in London to the Prime Minis* reference to Paper G.T..1C60*

axnister are re-circulated with

(G.T. 87.) February 27th 1917.

No. 464/17/m.

Sir,

I am desired &quot;by Monsieur Bratiano, Roumanian. Prime- Minister to invite your favourable consideration of the request made by Monsieur Bratiano to Lord Milner and General Wilson in Petrograd, Tor the supply of the Roumanian Army with the heavy artillery demanded for the Roumanian Government &quot;by the French Government..

Monsieur Bratiano also wishes me to poiftt out how important * it is for the Roumanian Government that their requirements-should . &quot;be integrally fulfilled and with, the greatest possible despatch,... as the heavy.artillery is absolutely and urgently necessary for the reorganisation 6t the Roumanian Army and will at the same time greatly contribute to raise the &quot;moral&quot; of the soldiers.

I, therefore should feel extremely obliged if you,would be so good as to consider this request at your earliest convenience and let me be informed of the steps which His Majesty&apos;s Government intend to take in the matter 

Thanking you in anticipation for your support,,

I have the honour to be with the highest consideration,

Sir,

Your most obedient, humble Servant,

The Roumanian Minister

 Ho. 671/17/m. March 9, 1917

Sir,

With reference to my Bote Ho .464/17/Mil. of the 27th. ultimo, I have the honour to inform you that I havo again been rogues bed by the Roumanian Prime Minister to make m earnest appeal to His Majesty&apos;s Government for the supply of the heavy artillery neoe3sary for the re - organic &amp;ti on of the Roumanian Army.

Monsieur Bratieno&apos; wishes me to impress upon His Majesty&apos;s Government the utmost urgency of these requirements end to say that, after the reverses sustained by the Roumanian Army which were partly due to the lack of artillery of heavy calibre, it -would involve a heavy moral responsibility to send again the Roumanian troops into the firing line without a&amp;e opiate armament.

The French Government having declared their inability to provide the Roumanian Army with heavy artillery, have advised tho Roumanian Government to apply to His MajestyTs Government for the fulfilment of their requirements.

I should therefore feel extremely obliged if you would give the above request your earnest consideration and enable me at an. early date to inform my Government that their req^st has met with the favourable consideration of His Majesty&apos;s. Government.

I have tho honour to be

with the highest consideration,

Sir,

Your most obedient, humble Servant,

The Roumanian Minister,
