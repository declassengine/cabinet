THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST CONFERENCE AT STOCKHOLM. (l)   The origins of the Conference.

IThe invitations to the Conference were issued by several Dutch Socialist leaders early in April last.   These Dutchmen had &quot;been co-opted onto the Executive of the International when the latter was transferred from Brussels to the Hague after the outbreak of war, but their action was not endorsed by the Belgian leaders who constituted the original Executive before the War. On May 4th, -in fact, M. Vandervelde formally dissociated himself from the action of his Dutch colleagues, and denied that they had the right to speak in the name of the International.

On the other hand the Belgian Secretary of the International, M. Camille Huysmans, who had carried on the organisation at the Hague, now accompanied the Dutch leaders to Stockholm, as their &quot;technical assistant&quot;.   On May 23rd the Dutch amalgamated themselves with a committee of Scandinavian Socialists as a &quot;Dutch Scandinavian Standing Committee&quot; under Mr Branting&apos;s presidency, and M. Huysmans acted as seoretary for this committee also.

The new Standing Committee drew up the programme for the Conference.   It was arranged that there should be preliminary audiences between the Standing Committee and the separate national delegations.   After the ground had been thus prepared, it was hoped that the national delegations, from neutral countries and from both belligerent camps, would meet face to face in a &quot;Plenary Conference&quot;.

From this moment onwards the proceedings were dominated by the personality of Mr Brantlng. It seems certain that the original invitations were not sent  out on his initiative;   but he

alcne of European So-cial s&quot;t leaders-possessed the prestige and T&amp;pvfte&amp;lmL-fvt-impartiality (in spite of his frank sympathy with the Entente) which the president of such a conference required.     It was natural that all who desired the Conference should look to him to carry it through*

The Standing Committee and the National Delegates.

From the middle of May onwards the Standing Committee gave audiences to a number of delegations representing the Socialist Parties of belligerent countries or groups within them.   Branting made public the progress of events in his paper the Stockholm &quot;Sozial-Demokraten&quot;, and many of the national delegations5 programmes were published here after their audience was over.

By about May 22nd the Bulgarian deleg&amp;tlon\ had been Joined by the Austrians, Hungarians and Finns.   The Germans, both Majority and Minority, were still absent, and there was no sign of Russians, Americans, Italians, Belgians, French or English.

The Standing Committee had been constituted on May 3rd; the Conference itself, in its first stage of preliminary audiences, was formally opened on May 16th.

On May 18th the Standing Committee issued an important manifesto, recapitulating the history of the Conference up to date;   referring to the C.W.S.D.&apos;s proposal for a conference and expressing a desire for co-operation therewith; explaining the procedure of separate audiences as a preliminary to a plenary conference;   and insisting on the non-partisan aims of the Committee itself.

The audiences which now followed can be tabulated most conveniently in chronological order:-

May 21-2 :   Bulgarian Audience:-

Bulgarian (Broad) Programme:   Tae &quot;national&quot; unifIctttloKh j, of the Bulgarian people;   this not to count as annexation; apart from this, restoration of Serbia, Montenegro, Rumania,


313

Belgivuti;   national autoe^ftey and self-determination the right of all peoples;   Alsace-Lorraine should be settled on this basis, and (!) &quot;on the lines of the declarations recently made by German Social Democracy&quot;;   disarmament and international organisation.

May 23-4:     Finnish Audience:-

Finnish programme:   The Finnish question must be recognised as international;   Finland must have complete independence; this the only safeguard against possible renascence of imperialism in Russia.

May 25-6:     Austrian Audience:-

The German Austrian Socialist Party in the Reichstag was represented by Adler (pere), Hartmann, Ellenbogen, Seitz, Huoher (all Majoritarians);   they were accompanied by a Polish delegate, two &quot;Bohemians&quot; (afterwards denounced as lmposters by the Czech Socialist Party), and two Bosnians (who, like the Bohemians, were apparently emissaries of the Government).

Austrian Programme:-

In Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe territorial national States are impossible;   dismemberment of large States here would only promote imperialistic designs of other large States.   Solution not dismemberment, but internal autonomy. Special points:-

(a) and (b):   Immediate peace without indemnities or annexations;   Belgium and Serbia, especially, to be restored; Serbia to obtain access to sea by union with Montenegro.

(c) South-Slavonic territories of Austria-Hungary to remain part of the Monarchy. Bosnia not excepted; Socialists to support efforts towards autencay there.


1(d) Finland and Russian Poland to be independent; alicia and Prussian Poland to receive autonomy without prejudice to integrity of Austria and Germany}   permanent solution of Polish problfcBi by free agreement between Central Powers and independent Russian Poland.

(e) Austria the preserver, not oppressor, of small nationalities;   free access to colonial areas and raw materials is more to the point than &quot;liberation of small nationalities&quot;; protest sgainst the Paris Conference.

(f) Freedom of the seas on the lines laid down at Paris in 1856; disarmament.

May 29 - June 3:   Hungarian Audience:-Hungarian Programme:-

(a) Immediate peace,   without annexations or indemnities; each State to make good damage in its own territory; these principles subject to following exceptions:-

1. Belgian damage to be made good by Germany (or alternatively by all belligerents in proportion to their resources).

2. Serbian damage to be made good by all belligerents proportionately.   Serbia to have access to sea and favourable commercial treaties with Austria-Hungary.

3. Questions of Alsace-Lorraine and Macedonia to be settled by agreement between French and Serman, and Serbian and Bulgarian, Socialists respectively.

4. All sections of Poland to be united in a national state with independence and free trade (alternatively, independence for Russian Poland and autonomy for Austrian and Prussian).


315

6.

5. Solution of nationality problem not dismemberment but democratisation and &quot;autonomy within present state&quot;.

(N.B. - This presumably leaves Dualism intact, and would still partition the Czecho-Slovaks, for example, and the Jugoslavs between the existing states of Hungary and Austria).

6. Restoration of colonies and open door.

(b) International organisation;   disarmament; inter-nationalisation of water-ways;   protest against trade-war.

(c) Social as well as national questions should be discussed at Peace Conference.

(d) Discussion of responsibility for war unprofitable, all Governments being responsible;   but Hungarian Socialists will not refuse such discussion if it is a necessary element in a genuinely international conference.

N.B. - This Hungarian programme is noticeably more radical than Wwa* the Austrian, chiefly, no doubt, because the Hungarian Socialists have no seats In the Hungarian Parliament, and therefore have no political position to lose by frankness.

The programme is reported to have much distressed the Hungarian Government.

June 3: &quot;Bohemian&quot; Audience

Programme:   A vague endorsement of the Austrian programme &quot;unhampered national and economic development for all peoples, especially for the Czechs&quot;.    (N.B.   The so-called Bohemian delegates were denounced on June 4th as Imposters by the Czech Socialist Party).

June 4, 7, XI:   German MaJ oritarlan Audienoest-

The German Majoritarian delegates to the International and

Trades-Union   Conferences at Stockholm travelled from Berlin to

Copenhagen on Hay 29th.     They were: Ebert, Hermann Mftller, David,

Molkenbuhr, Richard Fischer, Legien (president of the Trades-Union

Conference which proved abortive). Bauer,   .laesebach and Scheidemann

had arrived at Copenhagen a few days before.

On June 1st David gave an interview to the   Copenhagen &quot;Sozial-

Demokraten&quot; on Alsace-Lorraine.     He used historical arguments, and

(1)

took an uncompromising line.     On June 2nd the delegates visited the&apos; offioes of the &quot;Soaial Demokraten&quot; and conferred with the Danish Socialists.     On June 3rd they left for Stookholm, accompanied by StawAing..

In the sympathetic atmosphere of Copenhagen they openly revealed their governmental point of view, and this doubtless caused difficulties when they met Branting.     The first audience is stated to have been broken off, and it was not till the audience of June 11th that Scheidemann formulated his programme.     It might have been expected that he would outline a positive settlement on the basis of the Status Quo, for the Status Quo .&apos;as the programme he had put forward against the Fan-Germans in the Reichstag on May 15th.

MI wish to make it dear,&quot; he said, &quot;that v-e are German Social Democrats.     We wish to make sure of our independence and national security, but we will have nothing to do with forcible domination over other peoples.......

&quot;We renounce the possession of that v/hich is not ours; but we do not renounce the necessity of the German people emerging as a free people from this war.......

(1)     The interview        of the same propagandist kind as Dr. Dernburg&apos;s, for example, in the early msnths of the war.


1

317

&quot;We are in deadly earnoet in demanding a peace by understanding....-There was not a wofit of this in the published report of the Majori-tarian audionce at Stockholm.

The Ma.loritarian Programme, wired by Scheidemann to &quot;Vorwarts&quot; on June 11th and subsequently circulated by the German Wireless, is a distinctly disappointing document.     Instead of suggesting lines of settlement, it is concerned exclusively with the origin of the War.     It ascribes the War to Imperialism, and argues, polemically and in detail, that Entente and not Centralist Imperialism bears the guilt.     The Entente Is the aggressor, Germany is on the defensive;   England is really to blame for the misfortunes of Belgium.


318

III      Action by the Standing Committee

While the Audiences with the national delegations were in progress, the Standing Committee began to define a programme of its own.

v*. ulay 26th it is said to have issued a statement that it would work for the restoration of Serbia, Montenegro, Rumania and Belgium;   for the settlement of Alsace-Lorraine on the basis of the right of peoples to dispose of themselves;   for a speedy peace disarmament and arbitration.

On May 30th Troelstra is said to have discussed, in an interview with a representative of the Hungarian newspaper &quot;A.Vilag&quot;, the means of bringing pressure to bear on governments to carry out &quot;the-decisions at which the Stockholm Conference might arrive. (H.B. This^reported interview should not be taken too seriously. Troelstra was evidently talking theoretically, and there is no indication that the Standing Committee or Branting have the least intention of bringing pressure to bear on the Entente.     On the contrary, they have exerted pressure so fr,r exclusively on the German Majoritarians).

On June 2nd the Standing Committee telegraphed to the Petro-grad C.W.S.D., asking them to send a delegation tp Stockholm as a preliminary to the plenary oonferenoe.     They also telegraphed on the same date to President Wilson stating their hope that the rumour that American delegates had been refused passports was unfounded.

On June 4th M. Branting gave an interview to the Stockholm correspondent of the American United Press, in which he made the following paints:-

(s&gt;)   Poland, Belgium, Finland, Alsace-Lorraine are the biggest problems of the War.

(b)   &quot;I know Russian Poland will be free but I do not know


319

id.

about Husfcfcian and .&quot;Russian Poland&quot;.     (&gt;?.B. - A bit at the Geinian and Austrian Majoritarian doctrine of the  Status Quo).

(o)   There must be a plebiscite in Alsaoe-Torraine.

(d) &quot;(The Germans say that Alsaoe is German but forget that Lorraine is always French.&quot;

(e) It is a slander that Trance and England desire the partition of Austria-Hungary.

IV    Invitation from the C.V7.S.D. ~nd Vendervelde - Thomas - Henderson Manifesto.

On June 4th the Petrograd C.K/,3.3). issued an invitation to the Socialist parties and Trades Union Federations of the 7orld, summoning them to an international conference-, as it *!d announced its intention of doing in its manifesto ef Kay 10th.    The chief points in this invitation were these:-

(a) Like the previous manifesto, It completely ignored the Conference actually sitting at iatockholm.

(b) It proposed as the main object of the Conference the termination of the Party Truce in the various belligerent oountries.

(o)   It declared that acceptance of the invitation involved those who accepted it in &quot;carrying out unfailingly the deoieions at which the Conference should arrive.&quot; On June 5th, Mr Branting, in conversation r&apos;ith Sir 3. Howard ofcttioised the Russian invitation severely on all these three grounds, remarking with regard to (b) that &quot;peoples defending their own territories are differently situated from those fighting for conquest.&quot;

On June 5th, too, MM. Vandervelde, Thomas and Henderson published a note of expostulation against the C.V.&apos;;3.I&gt;. invitation,


II

 pointing out that it had tc-Iien them completely &quot;by surprise and mating general criticisms on the saxae lines as i  Branting.

7  Effect of the Invitation to Stockholm in France and England.

On April 26th the Commission Administrative Perraanente of the French Socialist Party rejedted the Dutch leaders&apos; invitation, but called a meeting of their national council, to decide the question, for May 27th*

During the intervening month the point was fiercely debated, not only in Sooialist organs, but in the Press as a whole, and it seemed oertain that the Majoritarian polioy of rejecting the invitation to Stockholm would win.

On May 20th, however, the Sooialist confederation of the Seine, one of the most important sub-groups of the Party, voted in favour of aooeptanoe, and on Fay 28ib, after two days debate, the National Counoil itself voted for sending delegates - not, indeed, to meet enemy delegations in a plenary conference, but to have a separate audisnoe with the Standing Committee*

It is said that the Majoritarians were won over in the Council by two emissaries of their group, MM. Caohin and Moutet, who bad just returned from Petrograd.

Then on June 1st M. Ribot announced in the Chamber the Frenoh Government&apos;s decision to issue no passports for Stockholm, and also to withhold passports for petrograd till the conference at Stockholm was over.    The Chamber went into secret session, lasting till June 5th, but the Governments decision remained unaltered.

The British Government acted in conformity with the Trenoh, and on June 8tb lord Robert Cecil announced, in answer to a question in the House of Commons, that the British Minority fl.L.P.) delegates were being granted passports for Petrograd, but that these passports &quot;were not intended to enable the holders to attend or take part in any international conference at Stockholm, still less to communicate directly or indirectly, with enemy subjects at


4

19 9

t) hi u

Stockholm or elsewhere.&quot;

Next day the British delegates were held up at their port of sailing by the &quot;Seamen&apos;s and Firemen&apos;s Union&quot;, ana had finally to return to London.

The plenary conference has now faded into thia air;   but the series of preliminary audiences with Branting and his standing committee may still be completed when the French and Btitish delegates for Petrograd pass through Stookholm on their way.

The ohief results of what has happened so far seem likely to be these

1. M, Branting&apos;s prestige and international influence will be largely increased,

2. Soheidemands position in Germany will be shaken.     By going to Stookholm he has broken absolutely with the Pan-Germans to right of him and with the Minoritarian Socialists to the left;   and to the Chanoellor he has proved a broken reed, for M. Branting and President Wilson hare practioally denounced him net*-altogether justly, as a government agent.

TX~       Qerman^MaJo^ltarian Programme   -  Final Text

Sine* he above report was written, the Standing Committee

^ji^p*|&gt;lifib5ar^ the German Major!tarlan Delegation,

-which d/v   contain in detail-their proposals for a settlement - and

this just on the line, that were to be expeoted from their attitude

In the Belohstag on May 15th, and from the programme of the Austrian

Majorltarlana, summarised above.

The points made in this German Majoritarian Programme are

these:*

German Sooial Democracy wants peaoe by understanding, without violation of vital national Interests on either side, and there fore accepts C.W.S.D. formula of &quot;Ho Annexations or Indemnities It applies the general principle as follows:-

1. Ho ohange of frontiers except by understanding; oolonies to be returned as a matter of course.

8.   Ho Indemnities, sinoe indemnities involve economic enslavement        meat of one people by another.

2. Restoration of political independence agreed; restoration of ravages caused by war rejected.     (Compare ScheidemannTs earlier formula:   &quot;Eaoh must bear his own burden&quot; )

4.   &quot;National self-determination&apos;&apos; agreed to, in sense of preservation or restoration of politioel independence for states formerly independent;   oases in view:-

a. States which have lost their independence during the War;   Belgium specifically;   as regards Serbia and other Saltan, states, &lt;?oncur-Tdth -view of Austrian delegation (i.e. restoration here too).

b. States which have regained their independence during the War, e.g.   Congress Poland   (&quot;Russian Poland) and | Finland;   these to keep their independence..


o. States which hove neither lost their independence nor regained it through the war, e.g. Ireland and various (enumerated) colonial dependencies of Britain, France Italy, Japan.

German Social Democracy sympathises with these states&apos; claims for independence, but will not prolong the War for this purpose.

5. German Social Democracy stands, as it has always done, for &quot;national autonomy&quot;, if by that is meant &quot;cultural autonomy&quot; for sections of a country speaking a foreign tongue and belonging to a larger confederation of states,&quot;   e.g., in Germany itself, the Social Democratic Party stands for freedom for the mother-tongue in the oase of French, Danish and Polish-speaking subjects of the German Empire - for no less and for no more.

6. Alsace-Iiorraine &quot;could never be regarded as an independent national state or a special nationality&quot;;   it has not ohan changed hands ckurinjy the tfar;   it is historically German, and in 1871 merely &quot;recovered its original position trithin the (German) State&quot;;   it-  transference to Iranoe now would be contrary to the principle of &quot;No Annexations.&quot;. German Social Democracy stands for making Alsaoe-7&lt;orraine a federal state within the German Empire on an equality with the existing federal stp.tes.     This settlement corresponds to the &quot;repeatedly ana recently eipressed will&quot; of the Diet of Alsace Lorraine.

Finally &quot;ITo Annexations&quot; does not preclude friendly rectification of frontiers.

H.B. There is hardly a pretence in this programme of the impartial application of principles to both parties, though any


t) li J

&quot;peace by understanding&quot; must presumably be based on this.

In olause 4c, for example, Ireland is referred to, but the subjeot nationalities of Germany and Austria-Hungary are passed over;   Egypt and India are referred to, but the Arabs and Armenians under Turkey are passed over (in fact, there is no reference to Turkey in the programme).

In clause 6, the historical argument is applied to Alsace-Lorraine, while in clauses 4o and 5 it is not admitted.

The &quot;War-map&quot; is accepted as a ground for the liberation of Russian Poland and I inland, but not, apparently, for the liberation of Armenia.

Russian Poland is to be independent;   German and Austrian Poland must be satisfied with &quot;Cultural autonomy.&quot;

The appeal to the War-map is in itself a glaring inconsistency in a programme which purports to embody the Status ^uo;

and the &apos;?ar-map is invoked in preoisely the three cases - Russian (1)

Poland, Finland and Alsace-Lorraine - where it works most in the German Interest, while South-&apos;.Test Afrioa, for example, &quot;liust be returned as a matter of course.&quot;

But it would probably be erroneous to regard this programme as a basis on which the German Hajoritarian Sooialist imagine that Germany oan bargain with the Entente.    It is more likely that it represents the most liberal platform r/hich the Majoritarians feel themselves able to adopt in their struggle with the Pan-Germans, or, in other words, the utmost limit of concessions for whloh they expect th secure support from German public opinion.     If this view is correct, the document is extremely important as throwing light on the present phase of the internal political conflict in Germany.
