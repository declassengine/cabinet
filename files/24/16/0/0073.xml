Weekly Report on Austria-Hungary. V. (16th June, 1917.)

So far as the Reiohsrat is concerned, the situation in Austria still hangs fire.    The reform of the Standing Orders has not met with the opposition which might have been expected, and the debate appears to have rested on a previous understanding between the various parties.     The motion of a Czech deputy in favour of full reports of all non-German speeches was passed by 203 to 185: but despite the protests of the German Press (the ffeue Freie Presse gives $reat prominence to this &quot;going off the rails&quot;) tho innovation seems to have been accepted oalmly.

A vigorous protest was entered by a Czech Agrarian and a Czech Socialist deputy against the censoring of Parliamentary speeches by representatives of the Ministries of War and Foreign Affairs.     The President of the House agreed with their view and announced that he would not recognise the jurisdiction of these two gentlemen, but added that war conditions made it necessary to prevent harmful statements from appearing in the Press, and that he would therefore take the question into his own hands, while regarding the twq officials as his informal advisors.     Thus the immunity of Parliamentary speeches, whioh till the war was the one absolutely unassailable privilege in Austria, is at the mercy of a President with strongly Chauvinist German tendencies.

How little ground there was for hoping for a radical reversal of policy by the new government is shown by two speeches delivered this week.     (1)   Herr Doberaig, who has succeeded the new

President of the Chamber in his former position as President of the German National League, has formally declared that &quot;the representatives of the German people in Austria are ready to follow the Emperor along the path indicated in the Speech from the Throne&quot;*     This* when read in conjunction with the assurances given by the Emperor to a deputation of German deputies at the Palace of Laxenburg laet April and with the formal announcement by all the German parties at the opening of the Heichsrat of uncompromising opposition to Slav claims, shows clearly that the Germans Interpret &quot;the new policy&quot; in a distinctly German sense*

(&amp;}   The Austrian Premier on June 12th in the Budget Debate -a week later than had been announced - made hie expected statement of policy, but carefully avoided committing himself bo any concrete scheme.     When, however, he described the claims put forward on various eides of the House &quot;as a result of national passion&quot; and said that such wishes &quot;could not be realised if submitted in their existing form&quot;, his rebuke to Czech and Southern Slav Const itutional claims wae patent to all.     He further emphasised the need for &quot;a strongly consolidated State&quot;, and said that &quot;these fully tested-foundatione must not be shaken&quot;.     The exoited protests and interruptions of the Czech deputies show that they interpret his speech as a declaration in favour of centralism and against federalism.

In this connection it is worth quoting a phrase used by Hr. Stanek, the new leader of the Czech Club, on June 5th. He expressed regret that the Premier &quot;had left a door open in the Speech from the Throne in order to commit another breach of the Constitution in the interest of the Germans against the non-Germans&quot; This sufficiently characterises the Slav attitude to the Speech from the Throne.     Now that the original text of it is available, certain features emerge which were not obvious in the telegraphed

version.     The famous phrase which expresses the need for &quot;extending the Constitutional and administrative basis of the whole of public life&quot; 1b followed by a phrase which defines the sphere of reform in the words &quot;within the frame-work of State unity and with the due guarantee of its functions&quot;.    A later passage invites the House to pass over &quot;what divides&quot; and to study the permanent aims of the population as a whole&quot;, on the assumption that the conscientious fulfilment of duties towards the State ^annot be subjected to conditions&quot;  another indirect reference to ^JJte(Constitutional claims of the Slavs*    At the close of the sj&amp;eech special stress is laid upon the need for &quot;cultivating a loyal partnership with the countries of my Holy Hungarian Crown whioh has proved itself anew to be the foundation of the Monarchy&apos;s position as a great power&quot;*    This high compliment to Hungary has been the subject of comment both in the Austrian and in the German Press and could not possibly be reconciled with any intention of modifying the Dual System.

Following upon the Constitutional claims put forward by the various Slav parties in the Reichsrat, Mr. Onciul, a Roumanian deputy from the Bukovina, has found a novel way of demonstrating in favour of Roumanian national unity*    He suggests that the economic conditions of the Roumanian people are such as to make it possible for them to renounce the prevailing political regime and spontaneously elect the Emperor of Austria as their King, thus realising Roumanian unity under the Habsburg Crown.    Mr. Onciul is a Conservative politician of the old school and &quot;belongs to the little group of Roumanians whose lot under Austrian rule has  , always compared extremely favourably with that of their three million kinsmen in Hungary, and who therefore have always upheld the Habsburg dynastic tradition.     But though he can only speak for his little corner of the race, his action is symptomatic. V/e

see before us the same process as in 1848, when every race of the Monarchy in turn gave expression to its national aspirations.

The Neue Freie Presse, whioh last month had attacked the Saturday fteview  with the utmost official violence for its article on a separate peace betwsen the Entente and Austria*Hungary, now publishes a scarcely less violent attack otfj the Manchester guardian for its &quot;childish effrontery&quot; in making a similar  rf?frosal 

The Hungarian Crisis.   As already reported, the Emperor-King received a number of prominent politicians in audience during a period of over a fortnight after Count Tisza&apos;s resignation, and then sent Baron Burian on a mission to Budapest as homo regius t&amp; gather farther information.    As a result, the King has en- rnsjbed Count Maurice Bszterhazy with the task of forming a Cabinet.    The new Premier, who is only thirty-six, belongs to one of the richest and most powerful magnate families in Hungary. In politics he is a follower of Count Andrassy but has never taken a prominent part and must be regarded as quite untried politically. His seleotion suggests an attempt to find a half-way house between Tisza\ and Andrassy, for he   and his friend, Count Stephen Bethlen, were offered portfolios in the Tisza Cabinet only ten days before its fall.

The new Premier is reported to favour granting the vote to all men over 24 who can read and write and to all soldiers over 30.     This may be a premature statement of his policy, but it is quite oertain that he will be prepared to go further in the directio n of reform than the previous Cabinet.    He may, however, be relied upon to give a Magyar flavour to any reform as his views on national problems do not differ materially from those of other leading Magyar politicians.     This is indicated by his first public statement:   &quot;I desire to work on democratic linesj but %?

naturally democracy in Hungary can only be a Hungarian democracy.&quot; This O^n only mean that he ie not prepared to grant equal rights to the non-Magyar half of the population.

The first bare announcements of the composition of the new Cabinet are probably provisional.     Its main feature is the inclusion of Count Apponyi, the leader of the ohief Independence group; the fact that   he, the author of the Magyarising Education Aots of 1907, ie again to be Minister of Education in itself means that Universal Suffrage will be interpreted in a strictly Magyar sense.     What is still obscure is whether Apponyi has abandoned his opposition to the 20 years&apos; commercial agreement with Austria or whether his acceptance of office means that the agreement is to be revised.    Ih^ latter theory seems doubtful in view of the repeated inspired hints in the official press of the last few weeks, that any new Cabinet must accept the arrangements reached after 3 years of painful negotiation.     Count Karolyi himself remains outside the Cabinet, but sends his chief lieutenant, Count Bathyany.     The Budapest demagogue town councillor, Mr. Vazsonyi, is also included.

The new Cabinet is a Minority Cabinet: with the solid phalanx of Tisza&apos;s party watching it, and it is therefore still by no means certain that it will be able to face Parliament. Count Eszterhazy may decide upon a dissolution, but new elections must inevitably be an ever greater farce   than tho notorious elections of 1910, because quite apart from the absence of the electors, the eledtoralnrcform&quot; of 1913 has remained on paper and the machinery for applying it cannot be said to exist.

There have been great demonstrations for universal suffrage in Budapest, and the Mayor of the city himself acted as the bearer of a deputation to the King during his recent visit.     A very remarkable feature of the Hungarian press for weeks past has been

the prominence given to questions of peace and, in particular, to the Stockholm Conference.    The various newspapers have sent their very best Journalists to Stockholm and frequently print whole columns of their impressions and interviews with prominent Socialists, mainly neutral and Russian.     When a sensational journal like Az Est, which lives solely for circulation and popularity* makes Stockholm its main plank for weeks, it is safe to assume that the public interest lies in that direction.

The Hungarian Socialist delegation to Stockholm in a public statement on June 2st, while endorsing the Scheidemann version of Bno annexation or indemnity&quot;, expressed itself in favour of the complete democratisation of Hungary, national autonomy for the various r%ces Inside Austria-Hungary and the reconstruction of Serbia, with access to the sea by means of union with Montenegro, and the abandonment&apos;of Austria&apos;s traditional commercial policy totrarde Serbia.     The official Hungarian press agency has issued a communique&apos; denouncing the attitude of the Hungarian Socialists, and professes to regard it as incomprehensible how any Hungarian could &quot;confirm the slanders spread by our opponents regarding the oppression of our nationalities&quot;, or how any one could favour the material &quot;restoration of such a State&quot; aa Serbia.
