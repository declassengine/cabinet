WEEKLY REPOivT? OB ITALY, tl. June 11, 1917.

The War and International Affaire.

Vl/hile the eo-^peration of British artillery and British monitors in the recent offensive on the Carso has helped to eonvince Italians of the reality of Great Britain&apos;s good-will and appreciation of the importance of the Italian front, a good deal of suspicion and uneasiness has undoubtedly been aroused by the disposition shown in certain Entente quarters to regard compromise with Austria as admissible.

Italy&apos;s aims and feelings in regard to Austria are strongly expressed in the message with which King Vittorie Eraanuele recently introduoed the Prince of Udine and the Italian Mission to the President of the U.S.   &quot;Italy&quot;, he wrote, &quot;descended into the arena inspired by her faith in the rights of oivilisation, by her national obligation to rescue Italians from the oppression of a foreign dominion which had sought all too long and all too implacably to deprive them of every breath of Italian life;   Italy descended into the arena in order to reconquer and re-establish the conditions necessary for her secure and complete existence&quot;.

Similarly Baron Sonnino in his telegram in reply to M. Terest-ohenko writes:   &quot;Italy went to war of her own free will for the sacred cause of oppressed peoples and for the security of her own independence&quot;.

The Italians, who have had long and close experience of Austrian policy, are profoundly sceptioal concerning any possibili-

ty of politioal regeneration or repentance on the part of Austria and regard the disintegration of the Austrian Empire as essential to their own seourity and independence. It is natural that they should view with extreme distrust and alarm any symptoms dieoern-iblejnrithin the Entente of readiness to compromise in this matter.

On June 3rd, the anniversary of the Italian Constitution* General Ferrero, commanding the Italian Corps of Occupation, pro-claimed by order of the Italian Government &quot;the unity and independence of all Albania under the aegis and protection of the Kingdom of Italy&quot;.    All Albanians, whether in their own country or outsido of it, are invited to &quot;stand beneath the banners of Italy and Albania and swear eternal fealty to that which has been proclaimed to-day&quot;.

A semi-official Note, published in Borne on June 5th, defines the proclamation as a &quot;solemn engagement&quot; undertaken by Italy to re-establish the liberty and independence of Albania.     This engagement, the Note goes on to explain, was undertaken in accord with Austria at the Conference of London in 1913, but its execution was made impossible by the grabbing policy of Austria. In the earlier part of the war the achievement of Albanian independence appeared to be impossible not only on account of Austria, but also of &quot;the ambitions of certain megalomaniac neighbours of the Albanian people&quot;.     The war having annulled all Italy&apos;s en * gagements to Austria, Italy is now in a position to resume her traditional pro-Albanian policy.     &quot;The course of events in the Balkan Peninsula&quot;, the Note concludes, &quot;have recalled to our Allies the equity of our views.     These views, being in perfect harmony with the interests of the Albanian nation, constitute the best means of re-establishing a just equilibrium on the further

It may be noted that no frontiers are indicated for the future Albanian State and that the comprehensive form given to the apoeal may arouse apprehensions in States which contain an Albanian element in their population.     But it is as yet too early for any effects of the proclamation to have made themselves perceptible.

Economio Matters.

Of Signor Orlando*8 work in London and Paris fairly full reports are given in the press.     Mention is made of the objection raised in London against the waste of tonnage involved in the direct shipment of coal from the U.S. to Italy and of the compromise arrived at in the matter.

A decree which is being drafted by the Government to deal with the holding back from traffic of merchant vessels on pretence of repairs, but in reality in order to evade the risk from submarines, seems to be meeting with opposition from the shippers.     A meeting of the Genoese Chamber of May 30th, at whioh Signor Canepa was present and opened the discussion, adopted an Order of the Day hostile to the proposed measures.

Internal Affairs. l:ik

Parliament is expected to reassemble after the Whitsuntide recess on June 14th.     There are no signs at present of any likelihood of a stormy session.     Criticism of the Government is chiefly directed against the Palazzo Braschi (Home Office) as responsible for oom-bating the &quot;enemy within the gates&quot; and as the refuge of Giolittians. The celebration of the second anniversary of the war (May 24th) and of Statute Bay (June 2nd) gave occasion for renewed agitation against Government- Joleration of -neutralist and pro-German elements.
