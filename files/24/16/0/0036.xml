Attache Milltaire de Serbie.

AIDE   MEMOIRE

After the aide memoir which the Serbian Military Attache had the honour to hand in on the 29th of May, with a request to be put before General Sir William Robertson, Chief of the General Staff for a. decision which has   been communicated on the 30th of May by General Maodonogh,the Serbian Military Attache has immediately informed his Headquarters regarding the above and has now received from the Serbian War Minister a telegram generally df the following contents:

The intention of General Sarrail to get the crops by weakening one part of Salonika front and by sending troops to Thessalie could be attained in another way which would bring more success and more crops than it is possible to get in Thessalie.

If the Salonika front would not be weakened., but on the contrary reinforced and with a powerful offensive push forward deeper into Serbian and Bulgarian territory there could be found much more crops, because both of these countries according to fixed facts during peaceful times export yearly on average over one million tons wheat and maize, while Greece is compelled to import,

Rumania alone exports as much as Serbia and Bulgaria

together8

Taking into consideration the amounts of crops which Serbia and Bulgaria export yearly, with this crops could be fed for several months a bigger army than the army now on Salonika front which would not be the case with a relatively small amount in &apos;Thessalie,

2.

As a matter of fact to get crops on the spot, to

avoid transport by sea and submarine dangers it is much

more important and useful for the Allies to start the

operations up north in direction of Serbia and Bulgaria,

because by doing so two purposes would be attained:-

A greater quantity of crops, which are necessary for the army would be achieved, and

By a successful offensive a great strategical success, namely, to cut connection between Central Powers and Bulgaria and Turkey, which would accelerate our victory and most probably secure it in this year.

Of course such offensive against north would not be

easy and quick with the present forces at Salonika, but

with necessary reinforcements this purpose could be

obtained.

By reaching such a very important purpose all new efforts would be justified.

The Serbian Military Attache has the honour to submit this presentation of the Serbian War Minister to the Royal English War Ministry. 7
