MEMORANDUM ON THE RECRUITING OP LABOUR FROM ABROAD.

A number of proposals by various Government Departments to recruit labour abroad have recently been brought to my notice. I find that there are certain questions which have to be settled in relation to each such proposal. To obtain the right answer to these questions is of first-class importance, not only to the success of the recruiting proposals but also to British workmen. Among these questions is the attitude of the British workmen in the industry and locality concerned towards a proposal to introduce labour from abroad.   In relation to this point it is necessary to

/ f ascertain whether there is a demonstrable shortage of I British Workmen for employment in the industry in question. It is further necessary to ascertain the I attitude of British labour generally towards a proposal

2~ J to bring in workmen of the particular nationality concerned in the proposal. Strong objection might for instance be felt with regard to the importation of Asiatic or other coloured labour, less objection to the importation of Egyptian or Maltese labour, and no objection at all to the importation of purely European labour.

A further question arises as to the rate of wages and the other conditions of employment which should be ( offered to alien labour. It is sometimes proposed to offer conditions which are substantially more attractive than those obtained by British workmen engaged upon similar work. Again, proposals are sometimes made offering conditions less favourable than those obtained by British workmen similarly employed. In either event, if such proposals are carried out, unnecessary difficulties are caused. British workmen will complain that aliens are treated more considerately than themselves or, in the alternative, that British rates are being undercut by alien labour.

It is desirable also to consider the rates of wages paid for similar work in different parts of the United 1 Kingdom, and to ensure that the contracts entered into by workmen imported from abroad are so drawn up that the men will be bound, and will understand that they are bound, to work for the British rate of wages current in any district in which their services may be required.

It is obvious that any labour recruited abroad should be available if required for any Government work in this country for which it is suitable, and in which there is a dearth of British labour, and not only for the particular locality or works required by a single Department recruiting independently for its own needs.

It seems to me that the Ministry of Labour and the i Ministry of Labour alone is in a position to advise upon  &apos; these matters.

Further general questions arise with regard to the best method of transport to the United Kingdom, and with regard to the distribution of the aliens upon their

o   (33) 3256   Pk 139   50   6/17   E &amp; S


arrival: I may mention that the Employment Department of the Ministry have carried through successfully a number of schemes for recruiting labour outside the United Kingdom, and in particular have arranged for the introduction of labour from Holland, Portugal, and Denmark, as well as from Canada and South Africa. The Employment Department have elaborate machinery in the Employment Exchange system which is available for the receipt and prompt distribution of labour from abroad.

In so far as the importation of aliens for non-munitions work is concerned, the permission of the Minister oi Labour is, in accordance with Article 22b of the Aliens Restriction Order, required before any such labour is recruited. In the administration of this Article the Employment Department are constantly in touch with other Government Departments concerned in the control of aliens.

In view of all these considerations, it appears to me that in order to safeguard not only the interests of British labour, but also to avoid the creation in this country of duplicate machinery, it is highly desirable that the work of obtaining labour from abroad should become the responsibility of a single Department. I am confirmed in this opinion by the danger, which has already occurred, of competition involving duplication of machinery abroad between Government Departments who may propose to recruit labour in the same country. A further argument in favour of the centralisation of this work under a single Department is that, if separate Departments are independently recruiting labour abroad, it may well happen that one Department is finishing with the labour it has recruited, and is repatriating it, whilst the other Department is going to the expense and trouble of recruiting fresh labour in another or the same foreign country, when it could be given the labour released by the first Department if all foreign recruitment were under one control.

I suggest that the Ministry of Labour should now become definitely responsible for dealing with the recruiting and importation of alien labour; and that a minute should be circulated to Government Departments instructing them to consult the Ministry of Labour at an early stage in connection with any proposal to recruit labour abroad, and informing them that the actual work of obtaining such labour must be entrusted to the Ministry of Labour.
