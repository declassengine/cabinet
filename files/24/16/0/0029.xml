COMMITTEES Ofl TRADE AFTER THE WAR - PUBLICATION OP REPORTS. (Note by tho Board of Trade)

(l) The Board of Trade appointed in 1916 a number of

Committees to consider the position of certain important British industries after the War, with especial reference to International competition, and to report what measures, if any, are necessary or desirable in order te safeguard that position.     The Committees were appointed for the following industries:-

Coal,

Iron &amp; Steel,

Engineering,

Shipping &amp; Shipbuilding, Blectrieal Trcdes,

Textile Trades (Cotton, TTool, Linen,

Jute &amp; Silk),

Uon-IPei-rotLs Metals.

(2) . Since the appointment of most of these Committees

Lord Balfour of Burleigh1s Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy has been established by the Reconstruction Committee, and the Bo&amp;rd of Trade Committees have been linked up with this Committee by the appointment of their chairman as      officio, members.

(3) The Committees on the Coal,, Engineering, Electrical and the Textile Trades have completed thoir reports; the Iron &amp; Steel and Shipping &amp; Shipbuilding Committees will present their reports at an early date (in the latter case only as regards Shipbuilding).     All the Committees have taken a large amount of evidence and as a result the fact that their work is practically completed is generally known, and there is a widespread desire both amongst members of the Committees and in the interested trades generally that the reports shall be published as soon as possible.


). The late Reconstruction Committee desired that

the reports of the special Trade Committees should not be published until the Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy, and the Reconstruction Committee itself, had had . an opportunity of considering them, and each Report as presented is at once transmitted to these Committees for the purpose of such consideration.     (The Board of Trade now understand that it is considered vx inexpedient, on grounds of general policy, that there should be any publication at all in the near future*

). While tho Board appreciate fully the reasons which

make publication undesirable at the present stago they feel that it will be very difficult for them as e Department to resist the demands for publication, unless they are furnished with a definite instruction to that effeot from the War Cabinet, and are authorised to state that the decision has been taken by the War Cabinet for reasons of general policy. Otherwise the Board of Trade will be put in a very disagreeable position, and will certainly be charged (as in a recent oase) with suppressing the Reports because they contain criticisms of Departmental policy or administration.

} The Board of Trade would therefore be glad to be

furnished with the directions of the War Cabinet on the subject.

Board of Trade, 12th.Jane, 1917.
