With, the exception of increasing losses from submarine attack, there is no change in the general situation. t

Submarine Attack on Trade.

THE following table gives a true indication of the intensity of the submarine attack during the week ending the 10th June. It compares the tonnage and number of British, Allied, and neutral ships entering or clearing to or from the United Kingdom, with the number and tonnage of ships sunk by submarine or mine whilst on passage to or from the United Kingdom during the same period. All Coastal, Channel, and Dutch trade is eliminated. Commissioned vessels and troopships are excluded. Under the heading &quot; Other &quot;Voyages &quot; are included those ships sunk on other oversea voyages than to or from Ihe United Kingdom.

The losses have been widely spread in the following areas : South and West of -Ireland, 9 ; Mediterranean, 5 ; North Sea, 4 ; Channel, 3 ; North and West of Scotland, 3 ; Bay of Biscay, 3; Spanish Coast, 2. An increase in the number of sinkings became very noticeable on the 11th June, and this appears to be due to an increase in the number of submarines operating in the various areas.

The first North Atlantic convoy, consisting of twelve ships from Hampton Roads to the United Kingdom, arrived safely, the officer in command reporting that everything worked satisfactorily.

The second convoy of sixteen ships sailed on the 4th June, and a third is due to sail on the 12th.

Out of sixteen large ships sunk in the vicinity of the United Kingdom only ten were inward bound. It was pointed out in Weekly Appreciation No. 1 that the proportion of inward-bound ships sunk was generally higher than this, due to the better control which it is possible to exercise over the outward sailings. The change in this respect is probably due to the safe arrival of the first convoy and the holding back of ships for the second and third convoys.

Eighteen encounters have been reported between His Majesty&apos;s ships and submarines during the current week, and in one of these it is known that a submarine was destroyed.

The losses in the Mediterranean &apos;are again high. In addition to five British merchant ships sunk, the cruiser &quot; Grafton,&quot; of the old &quot; Edgar &quot; class, was torpedoed 160 miles east of Malta on the 12th, but she does not appear to be seriously damaged, and has reached Malta under her own steam. She is fitted with anti-submarine bulge compartments.

The Japanese destroyer &quot; Sakaki,&quot; - when returning from escorting ships to Salonica, was torpedoed and very seriously damaged with a loss of life of 55 men. She has been towed to Suda Bay.

The German submarine &quot; U 52&quot; has been towed into Cadiz Harbour. It is reported that she was damaged during an engagement with the British ship &quot; Ben Lomond,&quot; and the British and French Ambassadors have requested the Spanish. Government to intern her. It appears that enemies&apos; submarines are still operating in Spanish territorial waters. The Greek ship &quot; Aristides &quot; is reported to have been sunk on the 26th May, within 2 miles of the shore.

Minelaying activity has increased to the normal during the past week, and appears to be concentrated on the south-east coast of England and western coasts of the British Isles.

In addition to the submarine attack, the two armed-raiders which were known to [be at sea in February and March are still unaccounted for.

  Operations in the Dover Area.

The report of the Vice-Admiral, Dover Patrol, on the bombardment of Ostend docks and workshops by monitors on the 5th June has been received. It was carried out in a similar manner to the bombardment of Zeebrugge, described in Weekly Appreciation 1.

Four light cruisers, one flotilla leader, and eight torpedo-boat destroyers, under the command of Commodore Tyrwhitt, were proceeding to cover the bombardment when they encountered two, and later four more, of the enemy destroyers, which were stated by a prisoner to be on the way to raid Calais. &quot; S. 20 &quot; was stopped by long-range fire, and was afterwards sunk at comparatively close range by H.M.S. &quot;Satyr,&quot; seven survivors being picked up by her. Another destroyer was seriously damaged and a third hit, before they could reach the protection of the shore batteries.

The ships were again protected from the fire of the shore batteries by a smoke screen.

Fire was opened at 3*20 a.m. from the 15-inch guns of &quot; Eribus &quot; and &quot; Terror,&quot; great care being taken that the line of fire was correct, so as to avoid hitting the houses on either side of the target which are chiefly inhabited by Belgians. &quot; Spotting &quot; was carried out from an aeroplane, and the shot were quickly spotted on to the target.

The German batteries near Ostend opened fire and made good shooting, but did not score any hits.

At 3&apos;40 am, a smoke screen which had been started on shore interfered with the spotting, and after 115 rounds had been fired the Vice-Admiral gave the order to cease firing.

A photograph taken on the following day shows that a considerable number of hits were made, the lock gates damaged, and out of eight principal workshops, five were severely damaged, and two of these entirely demolished.

Information has been received from The Hague that both Ostend and Zeebrugge have suffered severely in the recent bombardments. It is stated that 400 pioneers were killed and wounded, three torpedo-boats severely damaged, and one sunk at Zeebrugge on the 29th May.

On the 11th June an auxiliary patrol vessel engaged three enemy seaplanes near Gravelines, and destroyed two by gunfire, capturing the pilots.

Operations in the North Sea.

The report of the Naval Court of Enquiry on the torpedoing of the German steamship &quot; Gamma &quot; in Norwegian territorial waters has been received. It appears that the light cruisers &quot;Cambrian&quot; and &quot;Comus,&quot; and four destroyers which were patrolling off the Norwegian coast about 15 miles to the southward of Jaederens Point on the 2nd June, sighted a steamer flying German colours outside territorial waters. When ordered to heave to, she altered course towards the Norwegian coast and ran herself ashore. After the crew had left, the senior officer of the British Squadron ordered her to be torpedoed.

Weekly Intelligence Report, June 13, 1917.

Russia.

Admiral Kolchak continues to hold the situation well in hand at Sevastopol, and it is rumoured that Rear-Admiral Verderevsky, at present Chief of Staff in the Baltic Fleet, is to succeed Admiral Maximof as Commander-in-Chief of that Fleet. Verderevsky is well spoken of, and his appointment should be beneficial.

Air Intelligence.

1. General Information.

(a.) With reference to the formation of a &quot; Central European Air Traffic System,&quot; recently announced in the press, it is now stated that a Zeppelin airship route will be established between Hamburg and Constantinople (an approximate distance of 1,760 miles) both, for passenger and postal traffic. There will be eleven calling stations on this route.

(b.) It is reliably reported that the raid on Freiburg, carried out on the 14th April, 1917, took place on the day that several &quot;Pursuit Flights&quot; of Upper Alsace were changing their aerodromes. For this reason only seven German machines went up. Of these, one returned safely, two were brought down, and four were forced to land on account of damage.

(e.) The first trip of the Italian Aerial Mail Service between Turin and Rome was carried out on the 21 st May, 1917. The aeroplane left Turin at 11*19 a.m. and arrived at Rome at 3&apos;30 p.m., maintaining an average height of 9,200 feet during the journey. It was slightly damaged on landing.   The approximate distance flown was 325 miles.

2. German Rigid Airships.

Number known to have been destroyed since the war, 19. Number reported to have been destroyed since the war, 31. Approximate number of naval airships in existence, 21. Approximate number of military airships in existence, 20.
