STATE CONTROL OF THE LIQ.UOR TRADE.

HEMORAHDUM BY LORD MILKER

I.

NECESSITY EOR IMMEDIATE CONTROL.

The War Cabinet (Cabinet 157, Minute 15) appointed | Finance Committees to report upn the financial arrangements for ^ar-time contr&apos;ol of the liquor trade and post-war purchase.     The Cabinet also decided not to take control until the reports from these Committees had.been incorporated in a Bill and until this Bill had passed its Second Reading I wish to lay before the Cabinet very strongly the view that more immediate action is needed, as accumulating evidence shows that much cf the Labour dissatisfaction is due to the beer shortage and that something ought to be dene at once.     If stocks were adequate, more malt might be released during the next three months.       The stocks are toa lovt to permit of this being done without a serious risk of shortage next autumn before fresh malt is available . J .The malting of barley cannot begin &apos; again before September and it is inadvisable to use barley for some weeks after malting.     Urgent though the present need may be, it is essential that the existing malt should not be exhausted before the fresh September supply is ready.     A small barrelage might be added-now but it won&apos;t go far.

The only other alternative is t*&gt; 3et up immediate Control. Thi3 would ease the situation as, under Government Control&quot;; the bulk cf beer can be materially increased, by dilution.

Sir George Younger.and Mr. Gretton, whom I have consulted on ths subject, are both strongly of opinion that something ought to be done at once to increase the beer supply, and are prepared to accept a preliminary Control by Defence of the Realm Regulation if the Government will guarantee pre-war profits to the Brewers until the Bill containing the financial schedule is through its Second Reading.     What they would accept is, in fact, the immediate setting up of the machinery for Control, with the object of increasing at once the bulk of barrelage by reducing gravities, etc.     They ask in return that this Control should not be used to close public-houses and breweries, reduce transport,etc. until the Trade have the Parliamentary guarantee for their future of the Second Reading of the Purchase Bill.

I have met ten representatives of the Licensed Victuallers of the three Countries.     The majority were on principle opposed to Purchase, but expressed every intention of being loyal to war requirements. They had been obviously under a misapprehension as to the requirements of the situation and intentions of the Government.

The establishment of a preliminary period of Control would be of considerable value.     The country could be mapped out into districts, District Boards could be set up, lists of houses to be subsequently closed could be prepared.     This preliminary spade work would, in fact, enable the Government to go straight ahead and exercise the drastic Control contemplated as soon as the Bill had been read a second time.

If this preliminary Control is not set up now, it is very doubtful whether the summer beer famine and discontent can be dealt with. I would most strongly urge that this policy be decided on without delay and set in hand.     A clear statement of the whole Government policy with the steps which have led up to it should be mado in Parliament at the same time.     Much of the public criticism is due to the ignorance or misunderstanding of the Governments intention.     There is also a feeling that noisy agitation may deflect the Government from their proposed course.

If the foregoing pzroposal &quot;be adopted, a slight modification of. the last Cabinet decision is neoessary.     In the interest of the Trade, it is inadvisable to rush the finance Committees;   but if they are to do their work thoroughly and properly much valuable time must elapse before their recommendations are ready.     Meanwhile, with the warm weather, public discontent will grow.

This would be accentuated by any further rise in the retail price of beer.     Only by Control can prices be limited or reduced.

I attach a separate Memo, on the machinery for Control. Before the details of this organization are settled, it would be wise for the Cabinet to appoint the Chairman, who is to control, and consult him upon the exadt form of the administrative machinery to be set up.

MACHITOY POR CONTROL.

War-time Control in so far as production and distribution are ncerned can only be Carried out through the agency of the Trade, e administration must, however, have the general confidence and support tho public and of Temperance Reformers.     It is further most import-t that, during the period of Control, the foundations for the perman-t post-war organisation should be laid.:&apos;;: If the War Organisation,both ntral and local, is now established on a sound basis and properly lit up, it will doubtless be adopted after tho war.

There must, in fact, be at the centre a body or bodies including ade representatives, broad-minded, experienced Social workers, as well Civil Servants accustomed to dealing with Local Authorities,Licensing stices, etc., and experienced in the machinery of government.

The Home Office can, and mast, supply some of this personnel, ate ownership v/ill involve wide alteration in existing Licensing Laws d administration.     These future modifications should be before the nds of the controlling body, even during the War period.

The Liquor Control Board have valuable experience which should t be lost. &apos; Although the Trade regard the Board with suspicion and alike, many persons connected with Social work would be antagonised

the outset if the Board were completely knocked out.     The Board is t suited to do the actual controlj but cannot be ignored and should

fitted in.

Success or failure will depend largely upon the Chair an and ;puty Chairman responsible for the Control.     The former should be a iblic man, unconnected with the Trade,  not too intimately associated Lth Temperance Reformers, sufficiently strong to overcome some of the ^ejudices and traditions of the Trade, and with some knowledge of antral and local government and administration.     He should, if poss-

le, also be in general sympathy with the recent development connected Lth the drink problem.     The Deputy Chairman should probably be a Lvil Servant (paid) who would bring to the new organisation authority

i experience similar to those of a permanent secretary in a Government

partment.

whatever is the precise form of the organisation it should,as pgards England        Sales, be under the suzerainty of the Home Office, nd should consist of two bodies, one executive, the other advisory, here must be a small body of practically whole-time men, and a bigger bdy of part-timers.     The former will be the executive and at first

all events will be mainly concerned with reorganising the Trade and producing and distributing beer, etc.     The latter will advise on general plicy.   . The former must oontain members of the Trade;   the latter ill be mainly representative of enlightened public opinion.   It would p well if these two bodies.had a common Chairman,, but this is not psential.     They should certainly employ the same staff and use the feme offices.

The personnel should be

The smaller body

fa)   A public man as Chairman (b)   A paid Civil Servant as Deputy Chairman (jg)   Representatives of the London Burton and Provincial brewers.

(d) One or two representatives of the Retail Trade (Licensed Victuallers &amp; Wine-Merchants)

(e) Business men unconnected with the Trade, who might possibly be Members of Parliament.

2- The_larger body should consist of the present Control Board

(Liquor Trafficj&quot;with a slightly reconstituted personnel, that is to say, it should include :-

(a)    Social Workers,  of whom some should certainly

be women, b| Employers, c) tLab our M.P.s 

The central organisation would work through District Boards, which would be mainly Trade Boards, and would deal with the production and distribution of the beer in their areas (about twelve for England and Wales) .

Finally, at the periphery, there would be Local Committees for smaller areas, whose functions would be to advise on the closing of redundant public-houses, on counter-attractions, building, etc.     They, might include Councillors, Justices and co-opted Social Workers:     thati1 these Local Committees are set up, Local Justices would be largely relied on.

The decision a3 to the best form of central organisation EUst depend on a number of considerations which need to be worked out in detail, e.g. the relations between the powers of the new Liquor Commission and those of the Pood Controller (as applied to Liquor), the position of the existing Liquor Control Board including their ownership of breweries and licensed premises, and certain legal difficulties, which will have to be adjusted, etc.,etc. As stated in my preceding memorandum, the first step is to decide upon a Chairman, who should be consulted as to the details of the organisation of his department.

SCOTLAND AND IRELAND.

Similar organisations with necessary adaptations will be required for each country, but it is most desirable to secure co-ordination between the three bodies.     This should be done by a Joint Committee of Chairmen.
