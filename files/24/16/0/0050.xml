THE PRIME MINISTER,

Memorendurn on ShiphuiIding_Prospects in the U.S.A.

Up to 1916 the greatest year&apos;s output Di! steamships from the United States was 481,000 gross registered tons in the year to 30th June, 1908.     The figures of subsequent years have been:

Year	ending	30th	June	1909	148,000

	ii			1910	. 258,000

				1911	227,000

	it			1912	153,000

	ii			1913	243,000

	ii			1914	224,000

	It	I		1915	155,000

u	ii	1	1	1916	250,000

The 250,000 tons of completed building in the twelve months ending 30th June, 1916, was no gauge of the capabilities at that date or at present, ftsince the later part of 1915 a rapid development of shipbuilding facilities has been in progress.     New shipbuilding corporations have been formed and got to work, whilst practically every one of the then existing yards, has laid down additional slips, extended its shops and increased its labour staff.     The growth started in 1915 has continued unbroken up to now.     As an example, of the rapidity with which&apos;shipbuilding plant can be organised, the Skinner and Eddy Corporation was incorporated in 1916,     The first keejj was laid at Seattle on 23rd of September, the steamer &quot;Luise Melsen&quot; of 8,800 tons cargo was launched the 23rd January, 1917 and sailed with a full cargo on the 17th March. Five-other steamers making a total tonnage of 53,000 tons have since been launched and completed &quot;by the same Corporation,

Another Corporation,the Ames Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company, started work on vacant land in Seattle on the 1st December last, and by the middle of March had their shops built and equipped, three 500 foot building ways completed and the keels of two steamers laid. Equally rapid progress from open site to finished steamer has during the paBt year been secured at Philadelphia and other places on the Atlantic ooast,

On the let May, 1917, the Government estimate showed that 217 steamers over 1,000 tonB aggregating 1,093,000 gross register tons were under contract for completion in 1917, This tonnage was divided into:-

Steel Steamers

Cargo &amp; Passengers Cargo .s

Tankers

No. 4

153 60

Gross reg,

20,000 684,000 381,000

TOTAL


In addition 99 wooden sailors totalling 156,000 tone were &quot;building, of which 72 of 119,000 tons will b6 fitted with auxiliary power.

This great*expansion in capacity has &quot;been brought about by the high prices offexed, mainly by foreigners, and the splendid profits obtainatie Sworn shipbuilding-The entry of the lIc eA  into Ihe war has made national needs, government demands and patriotism additional incentives, with the result that developments are now-being organised cn an unprecedented scale 

gHiil .PR0SP1-CT3 Qg TK&amp; ffi&amp;T SIX MONTHS .

Between the 1st of the month and tho end of 1917 the shipbuilding authorities estimate 600,000 tons of new merchant tonnage will be completed, the output steadily advancing from month to month as the recently organised developments commence putting tonnage on the water,

She German steamers seized in U.S.A.Ports number 95, with a total tonnage of 528,000 tons. All except the &quot;Vaterlancl&quot; have been damaged and some are at places so remote from repair facilities that there is no prospect of their being available for many months.     The tonnage of those which will be in seagoing condition within say the next six months is estimated at 423,000 tons.     To this can be added 67,000 tons flying the Austrian flag, giving by the end of the year a total addition of say 500,000 tons to the merchant fleet.

A third source is the steam tonnage now engaged on coastwise worlt.     The total tonnage enrolled for coastwise work is 3,500,000 of which 1,300,000 are steel steamships.     Only-a small proportion are fit for Atlantic work.     In fadt the majority of coastwise steamers so&apos; capable, tempted by the abnormal freights, have already been diverted to the foreign trade.     Under Government control some might still be diverted, but it would not be safe to calculate on more than 200,000 tons from this source.     The Great Lakes find employment for about 2-J million tons of shipping, including 253C0 steamships of 2,400,000 tons gross registero     Of this total 39 steamers of 1,400,000 gross register could be used for foreign trade if they could pass through the i/ifeliand Canal.     Thirty-five are too long to pass, but it is possible, as has been done in the past, to cut such vessels in two, take them to Montreal or Quebec in sections and put thorn together again there, a process which necessity means much delay, especially if carried cut on a large scale,     liven if this were practicable the removal of such steamers in any numbers from the Lakes would result in a disorganisation of tho iron ore and coal traffic and almost certainly reduce the output of steel.

What appears feasible and important is an arrangement that all now steamers commenced in the shipbuilding yards on the Groat Lakes, shall be of a sise, i.e. 3,000 to 3,500 tons, capable of /


-3-

155

passing through the We Hand Canal,  so that the whole shipbuilding capacity shall produce tonnage usable by the Allies.

Even if the sm?ll tonnage is net found suitable, for cross-Atlantic voyages it will be invaluable and may be essential for coal, iron ore and pitwood between the United Kingdom and the North French and Bay Ports.

yOOPBg    SHIPBUILDING,

A scheme, was launched and received support in Congress and in the press for the construction of 1,000 wooden vessels, with Diesel engines as auxiliary power, and a cargo capacity of 3,000 to 3,500 tons.   Congress voted a lar~e sum for the purpose.   After a considerable amount of discussion, the Shipping Board has reduced the total from 1,000 m 200 vessels; of which 50 to 70 are understood to have been contracted for. It is probable the 200 can be built without interfering in any way with the main shipbuilding pro gramme of steel steamships.

There is&apos;no question these wooden ships will be of great value.   They may be found unsuitable for tranatlantic work and for passing through submarine infected areas.   But in siich case they can be used on the Pacific, and as coal and general cargo carriers between the East Coast of the U.S.A. and the South American ports, thereby releasing a large number of steamers for cross-Atlantic traffic.   By the end of 1917 the first batch of these vessels should be in commission, and must be taken into account in calculating the prospects.

An estimate,- probably somewhat optimistic - of the extra tonnage available for over-sea work from U.S.A. sources by the end of 1917 shows on the above fibres :-

New steamers 800,000 tons. New Sailing vessels with

Auxiliary power. 100,000 tons, j

German &amp; Austrian steamers. 500,000 tons.-afi

Diverted from coastwise traffic. 800,000 tons.

TOTAL. 1,600,000 tons.-

from which must be deducted losses from sea risk and submarine attacks.

NEW   STEATSHIP   DE VEL QPICEFTS.

Amongst the established shipbuilding yards,  the leading concern is the Bethlehem Steel Group, inducing the Bethlehem Steel Co.,  the Tore River Shipbuilding Co., and the Union Iron Co., which in addition to their control of raw material, own shipbuilding plants on the Atlantic, in the Great Lakes and on the Pacific.   Thi3 group has completed arrangements for laying down 15 to 20 additional ways providing an additional output of about 250,000 torn per annum of merchant shipping.

The plans of the New York Shipbuilding Co., another of the older concerns,&quot; will increase it a output by a similar amount.   These are instances of a movement common to every shipbuilder in the country.

Side by side with the extensions of existing undertakings is the entry of now groups of Capitalists into the Shipbuilding industry.     First ox these is the Stool Trust, which controls an annual production of 15,000,QUO tons of stool, 50$. more than the entire British output.   It siso possesses the capital and the organisation capable of carrying through practically any metallurgical work, and has in its employ an army of highly skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workers  from which- great numbers could be diverted and rapidly adapted to one or other of the processes of shipbuilding.    The Trust has prepared the plans and secured tho sites for the construction of standardised steamers.   The actual number of ways to be constructed was, when we loft, still tin certain, but it is known to be very largo.

A condition which assists rapid development is the wide area over which the shipbuilding of the country is spread. The Atlantic coast, the Great Lakes and the Pacific Coast constitute three distinct centres, so wide apart that each draws its labour and to a large extent its supplies of material from a separate area in no way impinging on the territory of the other two. The attached plan shows the location pf the^e centres * the proportion each now holds in the total tonnage under construction being

East Coast ...... . 58$

Gulf Ports............... 3p

Groat Lakes llfo

Pacific Coast............... 30yl i

100$

In the big developments of tho last 18 months each of the districts has secured its fair proportion.

On the East Coast Philadelphia, which launched 49,000 tons of merchant steamers, in the 12 months ending Juno 1916  had 383,000 tons under construction on the 1st January, and will have 6/700,000 tbns before the end of tho year.

In the Great Lakes, tho American Shipbuilding Co., which completed steamers of 37,000 tons to June 1916, will in the next twelve months construct 200,000 tons.     On the pacific, in the year to 3pth June, Seattle launched nothing.    To-day about 20 steamers of 8,000 to 10,000 tons are under construction. Similar instances might be given of the other principal centres; in each of which new ways have been made, new shi&amp;ps built and thousands of additional workmen brought in.

ST2EL__FOR_SBIPLU ILpII|tt.

The production of steel in the U.S.A. is now at a rate exceeding 40,000,000 tons per annum, &amp; figure which compares with 105000,000 in the United kingdom and 16,000,000 tons in Germany.     A shipbuilding output of 3,000,000 tons would absorb considerable less than Sfu of the steel ma da*     There can be no difficulty in respect to raw material, although extension of plant lor the production of ships plates and heavy forgings will be needed, and probably some limitation placed on the use of steel in other directions, such as building construction and automobiles.

A more likely c&amp;uso of delay lias in the building of the propelling machinery *   Naturally shipbuilders are taking spocial care of thiP*    -8 an in.3tt.noo, the General Sleetric Corporation, which employs 60,000 men and women, has organised a special department for the cony&quot;^&quot;antion ox &apos;firbme Marine Engines and tate&amp;; contracts for 100 cote for large cargo steamers*   Some are now in urogross and extensions are proceeding which will raise the output to si^ cets this month, eight fcoig per month by August ana, ten by October.     The other great electric machinery maker, tho T/estinghouso Company, is following a similar course, whilst numerous engine building shops are being erected by the shipbuilding corporations side by side with their j&gt;ro;;ected &apos;01% ft Visions of shipbuilding slips*

But in their call fcr largely increased supplies of machinery, shipbuilders Will come into competition with similar demands nearly if not quite as urgent as their own. America is constructing a fleet of warships and has to prepare for the equipment in guns and transport of a great Army. Her own Railway rolling stock badly needs replenishment, and simultaneously with these home demands, Prance, Russia, and Italy are ail pressing for locomotives and cars.     In spite ^&apos;oi; therefore of the resource and .adaptability of American engineers the demands for machinery during the next fdw months may be greater than can be met&gt; add unless sbeps are taken to secure priority for shipbuilding, delays may arise from this cause*

LA. B v U R.

I have found very varying views both in employers4 and in labour circles.     The expansion since 191? does not appear to have teeen chocked or delayed by scarcity of labour, and the Labour Department of the Government estimate the number of men engaged in shipbuilding at :-

June 1916 .......... 36,000

Jan. 1917 .......... r/2.000

June 1917 IOOjOOO

The U.s.Ac as the producer and manufacturer of more steel than Great Britain- Belgium and Germany combined, has at command a proportionate number of highly skilled metallurgical mechanics* All building throughout the country other than private residences is steel construction a,nd the skill of tens of thousands of men engaged in such work could be adapted to the hull construction work of the shipyards.

5 he automobile, industry in its volume of production and in the numbers of men employed exceeds that of all Europe, A portion of the equipment and personnel can if necessary be diverted to the construction of engines and machinery for ships* The delay, if any, in diversion to shipbuilding of labour in sufficient volume is more likely to arise from disputes as to wages and conditions and the obj&apos;ecbion of the men to change the nature and place of employment.     Whilst we have foii&amp;d very


158

m

littlo opposition in American Labour circles,  there is by no means the enthusiasm for the war, which operated so powerfully in our own country.   As new ships are laid down, and the demand for skilled men gp ws and rjrows, unless careful &gt;: ...\d politic arrangements are made,  shipbuilders will find themselves checked by shortage of labour.   In any estinates m.ade# this factor must be taken into account.

S, A I L 0 3 3   &amp;c .

Avquestion that may become of 3rave importance is the &apos; manning of the new steamers.   There hag been for months a growing difficulty in securing sailors in the United States either for coastwise of foreign service.   Steamers arriving have been losing part of their crews,  the high inland -wages coupled with absence of danger causing the men, particularly Scandinavians,  to desert the sea&quot;.

Another matter deserving some attention is the supply of nautical instruments, which I am informed that America will bo unable to manufacture in anything like sufficient quantities, and for which, owing to our great shipbuilding industry there i3 ample productive capacity here. ||||

THIS   PROSPECTIVE . OUTPUT .

The great developments organised since the entry of the U.S.A. into the war can give no results in 1917.   But with next year a new era will open.   Possibly in January and certainly in the early&apos;months of 1918 the Steel Trust will &quot;be placing vessels in commission.   Simultaneously the other groups of shipbuilders will be obtaining results from their new extensionsOne authority estimated that from January on the tonnage completed would be 400,000 tons a month.    Such a figure appears excessive; but provided priority is given the U.S.A. should, in the first half of 1918 be completing 200,000 tons to 250,000 tons per month of nev* steamships, an output which should steadily grow in the later months,    I understand our Government has asked for, and the U.S.A. has agreed to. furnish 3,000,000 tons next year.   The prospects are, and it is the view of leading American Shipbuilding men that this figure will be exceeded, and if Government pressure and cooperation is maintained, with&apos;priority given to all shipbuilding requirements, there is no reason why the construction should not, within the next IS months be raised to 300*000 tons per month.   To this must be added the fleet of wooden vessels, which should during 1918 place f further 4/500,000 tono carrying power at the disposal of the U*S.\,


GOTilffJSMMg ACTIOS.

Up to tire&apos; date on which the U.S.A. entered the war, all merchant ships un&amp;fcr construction or contracted for, were on account of private buyers.     She Government then immediately gave to the Shipping Board - a body formed some.months previously for the development of American shipping - complete control and made it solely responsible for all shipbuilding work and developments?     ihe head of the Board is Mr.William Denman, a Congressman representing a Califcrnia constituency and with no shipping knowledge.     Prior to his Country ^oinijqg the Allies Mr.Benman is stated to have been strongly anti-British,     iit present there is amongst Araericanc a general suspicion, not only as to his capabilities for the post, but as to his desire and determination to concentrate every effort on the work entrusted to him.     On tho Lakes, at Boston, at lew York and at v/a&amp;hington, business men, iionmasters and Shipbuilders all echoed this distrust of the head of the Shipping Board.

Second to Ifr.Deniaan is Genoral Goothals, the engineer who carried through the construction of the Panama Canal. His career haa proved his ability, and he is held in great esteem amongst engineers... commercial men and Labour leaders as a man of sound judgment who will decido quickly, and determinedly put hie decisions into action.     Every leading man I met expressed regret that General Goethals was not appointed head of the Shipping Board.

There is evidence of frfcbion between Mr.Denman attd General Goethals, which in the week priot to our leaving America found vent in speeches made by both, in which each erpresised publicly his disapproval of the policy cf the other.

The publicly expressed causo of the disagreement was found in the question of building the proposed fleet of 1,000 wooden ships of 5,000 to 3,500 tons each, with auxiliary engines of the Diesel type.     These would necessarily have been built of unseasoned timber - General Goothal&apos;s e^rprossion. was &quot;the birds are now resting in the treas from which the ships will be built&quot; - and mainly with unskilled labour;   and would have drawn off numbers of shipwrights and ship-Garpenters who will be badly wanted in the Steel Shipbuilding yards.

Mr.Denman himself evidently regards the 1,000 vessel scheme as impracticable as he told me he proposed buildiiig 200 of such &apos;-vessels and I understand contracts have been Idt for from 50 to 70.

GovERMifflarr _ Js D-Htlaytng shipbuii^im.

The effect of this absence of co-operation between the Chairman Of the Board and his chief technical adviser appears to be that the steamship-building is not being expedited with the greatest possible Rapidity.   Thi s was confirmed by shipbuilders on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, who assured me that if they could only receive authority from the Shipping Board they oould at once, lay down further keels; but that: although.the Shipping Board was aware of this they could not get definite instructions.

On tho Great Lakes,  owing to the freeing of the st. ; -Laurence, new steamers for use in the early months of 1913 must leave by 1st November next,

Shipbuilders at Cleveland told me that with Government pressure and co-operation ship-construction on the Lakes could without doubt be expedited and increasedv

The primary question at the moment is not what the u * s .-A. can eventually do in the way of shipbuilding,  but the ability to complete the largest number of vessels within the next few months.

The day before leaving Hew York on my return journey I had an interview v/ith Colcnei House;, who is a cloue friend of President Wilson, and one on whom he greatly relies for advice* Colonel House whilst very optimistic as to the eventual ship~ building output,  also felt that natters were not moving with the rapidity possible and he suggested that the Prime Minister should v/rite a personal letter to President - Wilson setting cut the urgency of the Transport problem and the special value to the Allies of every ship that can be completed in the next six to eight months,-an urgency greater owing to the transport needs of the Army the u *s,a, is immediately sending, ana of the 500,000 men to be mobilised in September, and moved to Europe as rapidly as possible thereafter. \Wm

I had at Ottawa an opportunity of discussing this suggestion with Sil . Cecil Spring Rice,  who expressed the view that there could be no, risk in following the course suggested by Colonel House.

Mr. Balfour has already pressed the immediate tonnage point home with all possible force arid the President, Mr. Leraian and the Council of National Defence are fully informed of its importance ?   No one but the President possesses the influence necessary and unless he himself intervenes the existing friction on the Shipping Board, with its resultant holding up of new, construction, may continue.    The adoption of Colonel House&apos;s suggestion might have the effect of stopping the present hesitation and securing the completion of a number of additional steamers by January next,  between which and August 1918 our needs and the needs of our Allies will be most acute.

SUMMARY.

To summarise the impressions I received in America:-I ?   As to Shipbuilding.

(aj   An output during the remainder tif 1917 of 800,000

tons of nev/ steamers, which with new wooden vessels enemy tonnage and tonnage diverted from coastwise work should provide   -this year a total addition of 1,300,000 to 1,600,000 tons of merchant shipping.

(b) An output of new ships in the first half of 1918, at the rate of 200,000 to 250,000 tons permonth, rising to 300,000 permonth in the second six months the total for the year &quot;being further increased by 400,000 to 500,000 tons of wooden vessels.

(c) That with Government&apos;pressure and co-operation this programme can be much hastened.   The number of ships completed in the next six months largely increased and the output at the commencement of 1918 raised to 300,000 tons a month or more.

II.   To secure the best results the matters requiring special

attention appear to be :-

(a) To urge on the President the paramount importance to the Allies of securing every possible ship in the next six to eight months, and to induce him to use his peraonel influence to hasten construction.

(b) To maintain either through our Embassy or otherwise and in conjunction with Prance, Italy and Russia, pressure on the U.S.A. Government which will secure a continued priority for merchant shipbuilding requirements in material and labour.

(o)    That the Departments be asked to report as to prospective supply of sailors for merchant vessels, and if deemed necessary action be taken in conjunction with the U.S.A. to increase such supply.

(d) To ascertain if this country can assist in providing nautical instruments, or other necessary equipment for |!|| new tonnage.
