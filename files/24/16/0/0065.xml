Report for Period from 9th June tq 15jto jTiwe^JL9T7.

Pensions.

The number of pensions granted during the week to officers and men, and to widows, children and dependants (Table I) was 11,509 against 9,956 last week and 7,796 the week before.     The number is the highest since the Ministry took over their functions on the 15th February. Since the beginning of the war 673,671 pensions, including children&apos;s allowanccsJiave been awarded.

Table II shows that last week 05 grants of supplementary pensions and special allowances were made by the Statutory Committee against 86 in the previous week and that the total number to date is 4271. 2. The number of fresh cases of disabled soldiers

dealt with during thB week by the Awards to Soldiers Branch amounted to 4,400, - including 543 which had been rejected under fcrmer regulations - an increase of 1,200 as compared with the previous week.   Of the 4,400 cases, 3238 were disposed of by the grant of pension, permanent or temporary, and 1,149 by the award of a gratuity, while in 13 cases the cldims were rejected.   In the 543 cases rejected under former regulations 92 pensions and 451 gratuities were granted.   3,007 of these cases have now been dealt with, 514 pensions and 2493 gratuities having been awarded.

The number of first grant cases awaiting action has  been found on detailed examination to be considerably less than previously indicated.   The figures from week to week have been arrived at from notes kept   :bjr the clerks concerned of the number of fresh cases coming in and of

claims


198

claims disposed-of , the initial figures dating from a

however

long time back.     A stocktaking this week/shows that there are 4,456 cases awaiting treatment.

There has been a further reduction in the number of renewal cases outstanding at the end of the week and in 800 such cases the awards have been revised under the new Warrant without awaiting the date when they would come up for renowal,

3. The work of awarding and authorising payment

of Y/idows and Dependants pensions In current cases Is completely up to date.

5,150 re-assessments of dependants pensions were made during the week against 2,785 last week and 2,660 the week before.     There remain 55,331 cases to be dealt ?/ith (Appendix I).     In order to ensure this work being completed by the 31st October, the employment of additional temporary staff not exceeding 40 has been authorised.     The 3,150 cases this week include 1,094 dependants pensioned under the old warrant , Tho have benefitted by the i e-&amp;ssessment to the average extent of 3/9d a week, and 8 dependant parents whose cases had been settled by a gratuity under the old  &quot;arrant but have now been placed on pension at an average rate of 7/- a week.   The rest of the 3,150 receive no benefit., their pensions already being equal to pre-war dependence

As a result of the week&apos;s re-examinations as to entitlement under the new Warrant, 8 widows not previously helped have been admitted to full pension and 2 cases of dependants have been finally rejected. 4. The Instructions for the grant of Alternative

Pensions of which a copy is annexed (Appendix II) are now about to be issued to Local &apos;&quot;or Pensions Committees under cover of a circular (Appendix III).   They are issued on the.sole responsibility of the Ministry but in their

preparation


preparation valuable advice has been received from an informal Committee consisting of the following representativesMembers of the Pinanoe, the Pensions and the Disablements Sub-Committees of the Statutory Committee;-

Mr. A. A. Allen, M.P.

 Mr. C. II. Bruce (Adwty) Sir Henry Craik, M.P. Sir Harry Haward, Comptroller L.C.C. Mr. C. J. Matthew, K.C. (L.C.C.)  Mr. A. V. Symonds (L.G.B.). pending the coming into force of these instruction^ supplementary pensions have continued and will continue to be issued under the regulations of the Statutory Committee for such time as may be necessary to prevent a break in payment to entitled persons.     The Statutory Committee&apos;s regulations are being modified concurrently with the issue of the instructions to limit the assistance that can be given by the Committee in the future, as shown In the draft circular annexed as Appendix IV.

5. The sanction of the Treasury to the draft Royal Warrant for Army Officers and Hurses is still awaited.     The draft Orders in Council for Navy officers and Huroccs and Mavy Warrant Officers are before the Admiralty.

Treatment.

6. The Twelfth Meeting of the Committee on Institutional Treatment was held on the 14th Instant,

Thoir Report,annexed as Appendix V,hereto may be summarised as follows:-

(1)     Paraplegia.      Lonsdale House, Cnapham Park, has been opened as a clearing house for London cases. 4 have gone there and G others are shortly to go.

(2)


(2) Tuberculosis.    The provisional tirreatgemerrt

by Which advanoad: cases in London are admitted to the beds placed at the disposal of the London War Pensions Committee by tho Metropolitan Asylums Board are to continue pending further discussion of the matter with the Insurance Commissioners.

Additional accommodation is required at Bradford, Bristol and Derby and the provision of pavilions at these places will be considered.

The Red Cross Society will consider with the Governors of the Cambridge Tuberculosis Colony how the Institutional Committee can best associate itself with the proposed Institution for treating and agriculturally training tuberculous patients at Papworth Hall, 12 miles from Cambridge.

(3) Facial Injuries.   The Institutional Committee recommended that the Ministry should make a contribution to the Hospital for Facial Injuries at Foot&apos;s Cray for tho erection of workshops.

7. It has been found necessary to issue a circular to Local Committees to prevent any interference, through the grant of pecuniary assistance by them, with the scheme by which tho special Medical Board presided over by Sir John Collie deals with neurasthenic cases by the grant of a gratuity or short pension and trusts to the stimulus

of necessary work to overcome the functional disorder. A copy of this Circular (No.45 of June 7th) is annexed as Appendix VI,

8. The Officers Branch of the Statutory Committee report that 35 cases of discharged officers suffering from neurasthenia and 22 of such officers suffering from tuberculosis have come before them and the Local Government Board state that they have received 35 applications

for


201

for sanatorium- treatment for officers which have mostly been trent to Midhurst.     Steps are now under consideration for obtaining a complete record and proper following up of all cases of officers requiring treatment, the draft Royal V&apos;arrant making generous provision for the latter.

Training.

9. Schemes for training submitted from Portsmouth and Leicestershire   vtere considered by the Training Sectiofc of the Statutory Committee and approved subject to conditions and a number of cases for training individual men were dealt with by them.

10. Notes on the Advantages of Training by Major Mitchel&quot; of the London Polytechnic of which a copy is attached as Appendix VII have been circulated by the Statutory Committee.

Organisation.

11. A statement of the proceedings of the Statutory

Committee for the week ended the 13th June is annexed

(Appendix VIII).,     The Committee&apos;s Inspectors report very

favourably on the work of the Blackpool !7ar Pensions

Committee and unfavourably on that of the Committees for

Two

Midlothian and Pembroke./ Inspectors reporting jointly on the work at Cardiff indicate that funds are being expended without sufficient account of them and this information has been corroborated from another source.

12. The Parliamentary Secretary visited Liverpool on the 14th instant for the purpose,inter alia,of explaining the Warrant to a branch of the National Federation of discharged soldiers and sailors there.

Today he is at Bristol in connection with a meeting with regard to the formation of the Joint Advisory Committee on Treatment and Training for the Counties

of


of Gloucestershire, Wilts, Dorset and Somerset with which Counties it is also now proposed to associate Devon and Cornwall*

Notes on these Mootings will bo embodied in noxt week&apos;s Report.

3toff, etc*

13. Tabic III shows an addition of 31 to the staff of the Department during the week.   It now comprises 170 men and 2884 women or 3054 in all.   Tho slight reduction in tho number of men is due to the exclusion of staff properly belonging to tho Commiesloners of Chelsea Hospital. The Statutory Committee employ 106 men and 180 women a*

285 in all,bringing up the grand total to 3339*

It has boon ascertained that in tho month of May (during which tho staff was increased from 2920 to 2984 or by 64) 73 persons resigned, 8 were transferred from the Department and 2 were dismissed.   Domestic ties and health were the reasons most frequently given for voluntary resignations*

14. The total daily percentage of absences during tho week was 1*8 among the male and 4 among tho female staff. At tho Tate Gallery tho latter porcontage was 6*1. Tho prossuro on the staff there involved by tho heavy work of re-assessing dependants pensions has resulted In some additional overtime,, for which the necessity will be obviatod whon the additional women authorised have boon taken on*

18. Lord Plymouth, one of the Trustee B; of the

Tate Gallery and Sir Lionel Earle with one of the principal architects of the Office of forks had a Conference at the Gallery on the 12th instant in regard to tho Intake of fresh air into the building. The provision of lateral openings that had been proposed


203

by Mr. Vonables, tho Superintendent of the Awards

to Widows and Dependants Branch was agreed to and the

work is to ho put in hand at an early date.

Prefatory Notes on Minimum and Alternative Pensions.

Minimum Pensions for Disabled Men*

I The minimum pension in the case of disabled men is Hhe equivalent of what was formerly known as the

  flat-rate &quot; pension, but (a) the scale of pension has been Haised, the maximum for a private being 27s. 6d. instead Hi&apos; 25s., (b) the difference in the rate of pension as between cases of disease &quot;attributable to,&quot; and those

  aggravated by,&quot; war service has been removed, and He) the amount of the pension is determined in accordance  pith a scale of degrees of disablement which is set out in Hhe schedule to the Royal Warrant and Order in Council.

I The last-mentioned point is important. The rates of Hension laid down in the schedule to the warrant for ^ftrtain specific injuries represent, subject to an element JR)f simple compensation for the injury received, the ^fctimated degree of disablement or loss of general Working capacity which a man would be considered normally to sustain by the various injuries specified, and Bill be similarly applied in cases, of injuries not specified Hid- in cases of disease. The minimum pension, there-Hire, differs from the earlier &quot; fiat-rate&quot; pension in this Hnportant respect, that it is determined not with reference Ho the individual man&apos;s &quot;capacity for earning a iiveli-Hood,&quot; but with reference to the extent of physical Hsablement,caused by the injury or disease, and will be Hljusted from time to time after fresh medical examina-Hon by reference solely to the man&apos;s physical condition


and not to his capacity to earn a living. There will bemo inquiry, for the purpose of the minimum pension, into the amount that the man is earning or is capable of earning.

The minimum pension, &quot;which is now determined as a rule before the man&apos;s discharge, -will usually be granted in the first instance, at the amount corresponding |o the &quot; degree of disablement &quot; -which his condition at t| e time justifies, and this award, which will be conditiorml for a period of some months, may be coupled with a requirement that the man shall have special medical treatment. (The provision of treatment in these a|d other cases is dealt with in the Instructions and Notes lii j Article 6 of the Royal Warrant.) If the man is otherwise not in a condition to use such working powers as he has, his minimum pension will be fixed temporarily at ie highest rate of disablement, and the minimum pensipn may be similarly raised if at any time after discharge oae same conditions should be found to have occurred la consequence of the man&apos;s disablement. The minbniln pension will be made permanent as soon as, but mot before, the man&apos;s physical disablement is considered m \ medical opinion to have &quot;reached its final conditiof-;&quot; When so fixed it cannot be reduced, but may uuler I Article 5 (2) of the Royal Warrant be raised (temporally or permanently) if the man is able to show that pie i extent of disablement resulting from the original injfry or disease for which he was invalided has increased. 1

Alternative Pensions for Disabled Men.

The alternative pension for a disabled man is designed, speaking generally, to place the man in the same position 1 financially, within reasonable limits, as he enjoyed before the war, after making allowance for his remaining capacity for earning a living. The pension will not depend on|the existence of circumstances of exceptional hardshipMor will it be liable to be adjusted in amount according t&amp;the needs of the applicant. The alternative pension twill moreover, as a rule, be made permanent (subject tw%he terms of Instruction 20) when the minimum pensiowhas been permanently fixed.


I The alternative pension is a combination of the &quot; flat-late&quot; or minimum pension and a supplement similar Bo that previously awarded by the Statutory Committee, Brat its amount will be determined by two factors only : 

(a) the man&apos;s pre-war earnings, and

(b) his earning capacity.

I The determining factors are therefore simpler than those  equired for a supplementary pension under the Regulations of the Statutory Committee.

I To be eligible for an alternative pension a man must He in receipt of a minimum pension awarded under Article 1 of the Royal Warrant and Order in Council (see  Appendix A.. A man who has been awarded a gratuity  n the form of a temporary allowance will not be eligible.

I The scale of the alternative pensions is laid down in  Article 3 of the Royal Warrant, namely, the amount of Hie man&apos;s pre-war earnings up to 50s., plus one-half of  he excess, if any, over 50s. and up to 100s. a week, after Keducting the amount which the man still remains  apable of earning. The maximum pension, therefore, Bjhich can be awarded is 75s. a week.

Assessment of Pre-war Earnings.

I The procedure of assessment is fully set out in the  instructions. The Royal Warrant puts the responsibility ma the applicant of making: good his case, and it will be  he duty of the Inquiry Officer to verify the applicant&apos;s Statements and if necessary, to make an independent Hesessment.

I The most numerous class of applicant will no doubt be mat of men who before the war were in the service of an Mmployer.   In these cases the employer should be asked

for information as to the pre-war earnings, and, should  rilinarily be willing in the man&apos;s interest to give the  articulars.   It will be the duty of the Inquiry Officer  

In behalf of the Committee to send the form prescribed

|o the employer and to offer his services if desired in Hrriving at the correct figure.

I Schedule I. to the Instructions sets out in detail the l mode of assessment. These are necessarily precise and j will be applicable wherever the case admits, but cases


 The alternative pension is a combination of the &quot;flat-rate &quot; or minimum pension and a supplement similar ta that previously awarded by the Statutory Committee, bnt its amount will be determined by two factors only : 

I (a) the man&apos;s pre-war earnings, and

I (b) his earning capacity.  The determining factors are therefore simpler than those required for a supplementary pension under the Regula-jBnis of the Statutory Committee.

I[To be eligible for an alternative pension a man must I in receipt of a minimum pension awarded under  tide 1 of the Royal Warrant and Order in Council {see ppendix A.. A man who has been awarded a gratuity

Ithe form of a temporary allowance will not be eligible. The scale of the alternative pensions is laid down in jticle 3 of the Royal Warrant, namely, the amount of 9e man&apos;s pre-war earnings up to 50s., plus one-half of Re excess, if any, over 50s. and up to 100s. a week, after deducting the amount which the man still remains capable of earning. The maximum pension, therefore, ijhich can be awarded is 75s. a week.

Assessment of Pre-war Earnings.

 The procedure of assessment is fully set out in the Instructions. The Royal Warrant puts the responsibility op the applicant of making good his case, and it will be the duty of the Inquiry Officer to verify the applicant&apos;s statements and if necessary, to make an independent assessment.

HChe most numerous class of applicant will no doubt be that of men who before the war were in the service of an employer. In these cases the employer should be asked for information as to the pre-war earnings, and, should &lt;9dinarily be willing in the man&apos;s interest to give the particulars. It will be the duty of the Inquiry Officer o|&gt; behalf of the Committee to send the form prescribed toj the employer and to offer his services if desired in wiving at the correct figure.

 Schedule I. to the Instructions sets out in detail the mode of assessment. These are necessarily precise and  well be applicable wherever the case admits, but cases


 will occur where precise ascertainment is impossible,, and in these the Inquiry Officer-and the Local Committee must use their best judgment, based on- the information of the references given by the applicant, on the analogy of the earnings of others in similar occupations, on corroborative evidence as to the man&apos;s--scale of living and other circumstances.

Cases of alleged apprenticeship and. pupilage will similarly be investigated in the first instance by the Inquiry Officer.

Assessment of Earning -Gctp^cityi.

The Instructions 12 to 15 and the rules lard -down in Schedule II. are governed by certain main?&apos; considerations : 

(a) the applicant must show that he is unable to obtain his pre-war wages or earnings, or such lower wage as together with his minimum pension and children&apos;s allowances will make up his pre-war earnings. If incapacity is alleged and the man needs treatment, or if the man claims that he is unable by reason of his disablement to work at his old occupation but the Committee consider that he can be trained for another one, they should proceed. as in Instruction 14. If the case is neither the one nor the other, the Local Committee must make up their minds whether the man&apos;s condition is likely in course of time to improve or whether his working capacity can be permanently fixed at the moment. If the former is the case, and in all but a very few instances this will probably be so, the Committee should frame their estimate of his earning capacity provisionally at a low rate for, say, the-three or six months immediately ahead and at a higher rate for the subsequent period. The Committee may require a medical certificate for this purpose from the Medical Referee, which should be forwarded with the application to the Ministry.

(&amp;) The man&apos;s actual earnings at the time of claim may only be accepted by the Committee as representing his real earning capacity under the conditions laid down in Rules 2 and 10, Schedule II. The essence of these conditions is that the Committee must be satisfied (i) that


&quot;9

the man is really using-such1-earning power as he.has, and (ii) that what he is being paid -is proper remuneration for his work.

(c) It is desired that -the &quot;Local Committee should, as far as possible, be guided by expert advice in determining earning capacity.   This will be provided, partly by a medical certificate (Instruction 13), and partly (wherever possible) by the opinion of persons engaged in the same or a similar occupation to that of the applicant (Instruction 15).   The latter condition will, it is hoped, be secured by consultation with the Advisory Wages Board constituted by the Ministry of Labour.   These Boards consist of an independent chairman and two members representing respectively employers and employed in the   principal   industries of   the locality.    At each meeting  of   the   Board,   one  representative workman and one representative employer will be summoned from a panel list of workpeople and employers to sit with the  permanent chairman, and to form the Board; but the chairman will be. empowered in addition, to invite individual representatives from the panels to sit as members of the Board, and give advice in view of any special knowledge they may have as to the conditions of the particular trade concerned.  The Boards have been constituted with the object of enabling either an employer or a workman or any other party interested to obtain an expert opinion as to the wage which should properly be paid for the work done by a given man in a given industry.    It will be . seen, therefore, that the pinion of an Advisory Wages Board may be of great ssistance to a Committee in dealing with the case of a aan who is actually in employment at the time of his pplication for an alternative pension in view of the equirements of Rule 9, Schedule II.   Their advice will imilarly be of value in regard to the earning capacity of en who have received a course of training and if there s any doubt as to the man&apos;s capacity to earn the current ate of wage.{See Rule 7 of Schedule II.)   An estimate f the earning capacity of a man who is not in employ-ent will necessarily be a matter of greater difficulty, nt it is probable that in some of these cases also an dvisory Wages Board may be able to arrive at a more liable estimate of the earning capacity than could other-


]0

wise be obtained, and it will be open to Local Committees to refer these cases also to them whenever they think suitable.

An Advisory Wages Board will necessarily, in most cases, require to know something of the man&apos;s physical condition in order to arrive at a fair estimate, and it would be advisable that the Local Committee should furnish the Board with a copy of the Medical Referee&apos;s certificate as to the man&apos;s condition.

Advisory Wages Boards have not at present been provided in more than 20 towns, but the Ministry of Labour have it in contemplation, at the instance of the Ministry of Pensions, to extend the system throughout the Kingdom.

Minimum Pensions for Widows.

The provisions governing the award of minimum pensions for Widows are contained in Article 11 of the Royal Warrant. The rates of pension in the case of widows as in the case of men have been raised, the minimum being now 13s. 9&lt;2. for the widow of a private, and the differences between &quot; attributable&quot; and &quot; aggravated &quot; cases has also been removed.

It should be noted that the temporary or conditional pension which may be granted under Articles 15,16, 17, and 19 are not classed as minimum pensions.

Alternative Pensions for Widows.

A widow who is in receipt of a minimum pension can apply for an alternative pension. The widows so entitled are those and those only whose husbands have died in the circumstances set out in Article 11 of the Royal Warrant and Order in Council. (See Appendix A, page 29.) A widow, for example, who is in receipt of a temporary pension under Article 15, or the separated wife who is pensioned under Article 19, or a woman who had lived as his wife with a deceased sailor or soldier and who is receiving a temporary pension under Article 20, will not be entitled to an alternative pension.


11

The sole condition to be satisfied in order to obtain an alternative pension is that the &quot;widow must be able to show that the sum. she derives by way of minimum pension (pins allowance in respect of the man&apos;s.children, if any) are less than one-half of the amount of the alternative pensi6n her husband would have been entitled to had he survived and had he been totally incapable of earning. If she can do so, she will be entitled to one-half of the alternative pension to which her husband would have been entitled in lieu of her minimum pension and allowances.

An example will illustrate this : 

Widow&apos;s minimum pension ......... 13s. 9d.

Allowances in respect of two children ...      ...    9 . 2d.

 1  2 11

Husband&apos;s pre-war earnings ......,   ... 3   0 0

Alternative pension to which he would have been entitled if he had been totally incapable of earning.................. 2 15 0

One half thereof, being the amount of the alternative pension to which the widow is entitled .................. 17 6

The alternative pension to the widow is therefore a matter of assessment on the single basis of the husband&apos;s pre-war earnings, and no reckoning of her pre-war or present income or the number of her children enters into the calculation.

The method of assessment will be in all respects the same as that applicable to the pre-war earnings of the disabled man.

The alternative pension will be awarded once for all and will continue so long as the widow&apos;remains entitled to the minimum pension that is, until she remarries or for any other reason, such as misconduct, forfeits her right to it. No change will be made in the amount of the alternative pension owing to changes in the circumstances of her family e.g., when her children pass the age of 16.


12

O. Fre-War Earnings in case of Apprentices.

10. When it is claimed that a man had been serving as an apprentice &apos;for at least a year before the commencement of the war, and that his pre-war earnings should therefore be reckoned in accordance with the special provision applicable to apprentices in Article 24 (6) of the Royal Warrant and cf the Regulations appended to the Order in Council, the following rules shall be observed.

11. The indenture, contract, or memorandum of apprenticeship, if any, shall be produced by the applicant.

12.

Should any question arise a statement, signed by or on behalf of the representatives of any trade union or trade society in the district, testifying to the custom of apprenticeship, with or without wages, in the district may be produced as evidence of apprenticeship : provided that apprenticeship will not be recognised in any such case unless there is evidence 

(a) that the person was definitely under instruction and not merely employed in minor or casual duties whether with or without wages ; and

(&amp;) that it was intended that the person should serve under the conditions of the alleged apprenticeship for a definite term with a view to obtaining ultimately the standard rate of remuneration in the occupation pursued ; and

(c) that the wages, if any, paid were substantially lower than would have been paid for similar work performed under a contract of employment.

Provided also that the question whether apprenticeship shall be admitted in any case where no written contract existed shall be finally determined by the Minister of Pensions.


23

217

13.

14. The manner in which the standard rate of wages has been determined shall be stated by the Local Committee when the claim is forwarded to the Ministry of Pensions.

D. Pre-War Earnings in case of Student or Pupil.

15. Where it is claimed that a man had been occupied as a student after the age of 16, or had been articled in accordance with the recognised practice of any profession, before the commencement of the war, and that his prewar earnings should therefore be reckoned in accordance with the provisions of Article 24 (6) of the Royal Warrant and Regulations appended to the Order in Council, the following rules shall be observed.

(1) In the case of a student, a certificate signed by the principal or other responsible officer of the school, college or university of which the student was a member, or if more than one institution was attended, a certificate in respect of each,

 J and in the case of an articled pupil, a certificate signed by the person or firm to whom he was articled, shall be produced to the Local Committee.

pupil had been continuously in attendance since the age of 16 till the commencement of the war or the date of enlistment, whichever was later, absence on regular holidays or through illness, or for other exceptional cause, being ignored; and, in the case of an articled pupil, that the articles had been observed.


24

-(3) Where an application is made in the case of a pupil in respect of whom articles had not been entered into, evidence must be produced that the conditions were in all material respects similar to those obtaining in an articled profession : provided that the question whether the claim of studentship or pupilage shall be admitted in any such case shall be determined by the Minister of Pensions.

17. The pre-war earnings shall be the average profits derived by the man from the business, trade or profession for the period prescribed in Rule 18. They shall be  calculated generally in the manner required under the Income Tax Acts for the purpose of the assessment of Income Tax (Schedule D) upon trades and professions,

-and shall represent the sum remaining to the man&apos;s personal and domestic use after all payments and charges in respect of the trade, business or profession have been

 deducted :

provided that in the case of husbandry the pre-war earnings may, if the applicant elects, be deemed to be an amount equal to the amount of the rent or annual value (inclusive of tithe) of the lands occupied prior to August, 1914, the rent or annual value being estimated in the same manner as is required for the purpose of Income Tax (Schedule B).

18. The average profits shall be calculated over a period of three years to the date nearest to the 1st August, 1914, which may be most convenient having regard to the financial year commonly adopted for the purposes of the business concerned :

provided that where the business or profession had been carried on for any shorter period than three years.


218

25

the profits should be computed for such shorter period*, unless good reason to the contrary is shown.

19.  (1) Where an applicant claims that the pre-war-earnings from trade or business (other than husbandry) or from profession, exceeded  160, he shall be required, to produce to the Inquiry Officer in support of his claim&gt; a statement showing, either

(a) the amount of the relative Income Tax assessment for the year 1914-15 (based on the profits of the three preceding years) with particulars of any sums known to-be included in the assessment in respect of interest,, annuities or other similar charges payable to other persons; or (b) if no Income Tax assessment was made for 1914-15, the amount of the profits returned for assessment; or (c) if there was no assessment or Return,, a statement to that effect.

20. Where income tax was paid for the year 1914-15* on the profits of the business, the income as assessed&apos; for the purpose of the tax, on the basis of the profits of the business, shall be taken as the income for the purpose   of assessment of pre-war earnings :

provided that, there shall first be deducted from the

assessment  any sums included therein in respect of

interest;, annuities, royalties or other similar charges payable to other persons.

21.  In the case of husbandry, where the pre-war earnings are to be taken at the amount of the rent or annual value (including tithe) of the lands occupied, the applicant shall produce a copy of the lease or agreement (or a certificate from the landlord or the landlord&apos;s agent showings its terms) together with the rent receipts for the two half years preceding August, 1914.

22.  (1) In cases where no assessment or return for the-purposes of Income Tax for 1914-15 was made, and in the case of husbandry where the applicant does not desire to-take the profit at the amount of the rent or annual value of the lands occupied, the Inquiry Officer should call for the production of accounts. If accounts in proper formi have already been made up for the trader&apos;s own purposes,, such accounts may be accepted, in other cases, the account shall be stated in the Form tob  provided for the purpose..


26

(2) Any accounts or figures produced shall, so far as necessary, be verified by the Inquiry Officer by examination of any books of account, trade books, bank pass book, special merchant books, private ledgers, or any other available evidence relating to the business and the periods in question ; or, if necessary, the Inquiry Officer shall himself make an estimate to the best of his ability   of the income derived from the business, by reference to the before-mentioned books or other evidence ; and all such books or other evidence shall be produced by the applicant when required for any of the above purposes.

23. When the trade, business or profession was carried on by the man in partnership with another person, (whether or not a formal deed of partnership was executed) the profits of the business shall be apportioned as between the man and such partner or other person in accordance with such evidence as may be available as to the practice of the partnership before the war.

SCHEDULE II.

RULES FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF EARNING CAPACITY OF DISABLED MEN.

1. The earning capacity of an applicant shall be considered in all cases, whether or not the man is in fact engaged in any remunerative employment or occupation.

2. Earning capacity shall be determined with reference not only to the earnings (if any) of which the man is in receipt at the time of application, but also to the average earnings which it is judged that he should be able to obtain if his condition is likely to improve.

3. No account shall be taken, by way of reduction of the assessment of the man&apos;s earning capacity, of any incapacity, temporary or other, from which the man may be suffering but which is not due to the disablement in respect of which the man&apos;s minimum pension was assessed.

Provided that if the man satisfies the Local Committee that such other incapacity was due to his military service, they shall report the faots to the Ministry with a view to* reassessment of his minimum pension.


27

4. In estimating earning capacity regard shall be had in all cases to the pre-war earnings (if any) of the man, and the Local Committees shall be satisfied that he is unable, owing to his disablement, to obtain the same rate of remuneration.

5. The basis on which the earning capacity has been assessed shall in all cases be fully stated on the form prescribed for the purpose.

Earning: Capacity of Man in Receipt of, or After, Treatment or Training-.

6. In any case where a disabled man is receiving or is about to receive a course of treatment or training, his earning capacity shall be assessed as follows : 

(a) If he is unable during the whole or any part of the period of such treatment or training, and in consequence thereof, to follow any remunerative occupation, then for so long as this is the case, he shall be assumed not to possess any earning capacity;

(5) If he is able during the whole or any part of a period of treatment or training to follow a remunerative occupation, his earning capacity shall be assessed at the wages or earnings he is in fact able to obtain ; and

(c) In either case such assessment shall be provisional only and the man&apos;s earning capacity shall be again assessed on the termination of the period of treatment or training.

7. Where an applicant has received a period of training under Article 6 of the Royal Warrant or Regulations appended to the Order in Council, his earning capacity, if he adopts the employment for which he has been trained, shall be assessed at the current rate of remuneration in the occupation in which he is -engaged - or at such less rate as may be considered reasonable, having regard to his disablement, after reference in any suitable case to the Advisory Wages Board, unless good reason to the contrary is shown. The current rate of remuneration shall be determined in accordance with Rule 13 of Schedule I.

8. In any case where a man since his disablement has received training in a technical institution or other-


28

&apos;&quot;wise and is found to have neglected any reasonable

 opportunity of obtaining employment in the occupation for which he was trained the amount of his earning capacity shall be assessed at not less than the amount

&apos;(determined in accordance with the preceding paragraph) which he might have been expected to earn had he obtained employment in the occupation for which he had

 been trained, if such assessment is greater than the wages he is actually earning.

Earning Capacity of Man in Employment or Occupation.

9. Where an applicant is engaged in any occupation, and claims that his earnings therefrom should be taken into account in estimating his earning capacity, the particulars furnished by him as to the actual remuneration or profits derived by him as shown on the Form of application shall be verified by the Inquiry Officer.

10. The actual earnings of a disabled man if less than his pre-war earnings shall not be taken as representing the earning capacity of the man unless the Committee -are satisfied 

(a) where the man is in employment, that the wages earned are reasonable remuneration for the work performed, having regard to the nature of the employment, to the remuneration earned for similar work in the district, and to his disablement;

(p) where the man is not in employment but is otherwise engaged in a remunerative occupation, that the profits of such occupation are not less than he might reasonably be expected to earn in that occupation, having regard to his disablement.

{c} and in either case that the employment or grade of work or occupation in which the man is engaged is such as he could most suitably or profitably undertake having regard to his pre-war occupation or training, to his disablement and to the opportunities open to him for any other employment or occupation.

provided that in all such cases regard shall be had to the provisions of Rule 2.
