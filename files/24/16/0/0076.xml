WAR CABINET. Supply of Guns to Russia. Note &quot;by the Secretary of State for War.

The attached copy (Appendix A) of a telegram from General Poole, dated 10th June, 1917, makes it clear that little use has yet been made of the guns and howitzers which we have already sent to Russia.

As regards the amount of ammunition fired at the enemy, General Poole, says &quot;Expenditure on front not definitely known, but very small;   practically nil with heavy artillery.&quot;

He considers that the &quot;general situation here does not warrant any further   shipments of heavy artillery&quot;, and later he adds that &quot;full use is not made of heavier types (than 6&quot;) and local conditions are against them.&quot;

From the figures which I have giv n above it would appear that very little use leais been made of even the lighter types.

Since this question was&apos; last before the.War Cabinet our own difficulties as-, regards the supply of guns and howitzers have increased.

I attach a Table Appendix B which shows the latest forecasts of deliveries reoeived on the 10th of this month from the Ministry of Munitions, and the drop for this month in almost every type of gun from the figures given in their May forecast.

I do not anticipate being able to replace all the losses in Prance during June in 6&quot; howitzers while providing Mesopotamia and Egypt with the extra Batteries which it has been decided to send.

The Table in Appendix C shows the greatest difficulties we have to meet in the replacement of guns in Prance.   It may indeed be said with certainty that any guns or howitzers sent from England to Russia or Roumania will mean the withdrawal of a corresponding number from the fighting line in Prance.

OPERATIONS.

Prom General Poole,

To     O.I.G.S. 10.6.17. M.14.

With reference to. your 35669 to Military Attache, Petrograd.   Vickers type 31 8&quot; howitzers.   12 have been sent to front.   12 are mobilized but wait for transport.   Remaining 7 are held in reserve.

Vickers type 8   12w howitzers.   6 have been sent to front but are not in action.     Remaining two will be kept in reserve.

9.2&quot; howitzers.   One battery now complete and expected to go to front in 10 days.   8&quot; howitzers British service type. Two batteries complete except for loading Trays which have been lost in transit ohiefly due to faulty method of shipment from England. They are expected to go to front in 10 days with locally made loading trays.   Tractors for 8&quot; and 9.2&quot; howitzers have only recently arrived.

&apos; 6&quot; howitzers.   Two batteries with motor transport are at the front*

6 further batteries now completed and under orders for front.     Remaining batteries still incomplete as regards equip** ment.   Parts are probably now discharging at Archangel.

60    At present no batteries at front.   Tomorrow I shall be at Moscow and will wire full particulars of conditions there. At least one battery ready for front,

4.5&quot; howitzers.   There are 252 howitzers in action on front**   Further 72 are now mobilizing with 6 new Russian divisions Remainder held in army and general reserve.   I consider reserves of guns are too large, and I am trying to get more on front. Expenditure on front not definitely known, but very small; practically nilnwith heavy artillery.

The cause of many of the delays is absence of sights and other parts due to faulty shipping in England,   I consider general situation here does not warrant any further shipments of heavy artillery but I now await results of proposed offensive. The whole situation hangs on the result of this, and therefore, I recommend that no definite decision as regards official reduction of our programme should be made as this might handicap the influenc* now working towards a renewal of offensive*

In the event of improvement resulting in the near future, I should at once recommend renewal of shipment of heavy batteries but probably on a scale of 4,6&quot; howitzer batteries per month for 6 months and no other natures, as full use if not made of heavier types and local conditions are against them.

I should also put forward a strong recommendation for trench-mortars.   Two months will roughly be the time from unloading at Archangel to action.
