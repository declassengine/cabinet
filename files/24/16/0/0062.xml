COMMAHD AT SALONIKA.,

The War Cabinet directed me, in Minute 11 of their W.C.160/11,   Meeting of the 11th instant, to consider the question of a suitable successor to General Sarrail, and to suggest the name of some French General who would he acceptable to the British General Staff*

I am afraid that my knowledge of the French Generals is insufficient to enable me to make a recommendation. I have, however, discussed the question of a possible successor to General Sarrall with General Foch, and he informed me that he did not consider that any of the French Generals now in Salonika would be suitable.

With regard to the suggestion that the General in oommand should not necessarily be French, I consider it to be absolutely essential that the Commander-in-Chief should belong to the nation whose local representative exercises supreme diplomatic control, otherwise it is not to be expected that military operations can be effectively conducted*   Therefore so long as the present diplomatic arrangement obtains the Commander-in-Chief should be a French officero

The proposal to form an Inter-Allied Staff is in my opinion quite impracticable0   It will be obvious to the War Cabinet, I think, that for the proper working of the Staff the members composing it should have been trained on a common system, have a common language, and should thoroughly understand each other&apos;s methods of thought and action0   The aim in view - to ensure much closer oo-operation. and more cordial relations than have hitherto existed - is undoubtedly sound, and there is no

reason it should not be obtained in a way other than by forming an Inter-Allied Staff.   What is required is that each of the Allied forces composing the Army in the Balkans, should be represented at the Commander-in-Chief&apos;s Headquarters by an officer of adequate status who is in the confidence both of the General in supreme command and in that of the General commanding his own contingentj and that the Commander-in-Chief should be specially careful to keep the other commanders fully informed of his wishes. General Sarrail has made little or no attempt to do this, whereas it is an elementary principle of command that effective co-operation is impossible unless the superior keeps his subordinates fully acquainted with his intentions. The necessity for this is obviously greater when working with Allied Armies possessing different organizations, and when for a multitude of other reasons misunderstandings and difficulties are apt to arise.   If the system I propose is adopted and is properly carried out, the relations between the various armies would be greatly improved, and unity of effort would be secured as far as this is possible in such a heterogeneous army as the one in question.

I may add that the difficulties which have arisen in the past cannot be attributed solely to the organization of the General Headquarters,     They are also due to the fact that the policy of the different Powers concerned has not been in all respects identical.
