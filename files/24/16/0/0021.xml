MILITARY POLICY IN THE VARIOUS THEATRES

OP WAR.

As tho War Cabinet are now reviewing oar general war policy it may bo useful if I briefly summarise the military policy which*?, in accordance with their instructions, is now being executed by our Commandera-in-Chief in the various theatres of operations* ThiB summary will help them in considering how far our present military policy should be changed, and as they are aware, this policy is in scan  cases a matter of agreement between ourselves and our Allies.

1.   GERMAN EAST AFRICA.   To dispose of the remaining hostile troops and to complete the occupation of the Colony as soon as this oan possibly be done. Instructions to this effect were sent on May 22nd, 1917, to General

Van de Venter on his assuming command.

5  MESOPOTAMIA*   On February 28th, 1917, the War

Cabinet decided that:-

&quot;subject to the security of the force and the &quot;capacity of the communications it was desired &quot;to establish British influence in the Baghdad

&quot;vilayet&quot;

General Maude has boen instructed accordingly*

I think General l-iaude should be able to carry out this policy successfully if sea transport is found to send him by the first week of August the necessary

additional

jz&gt;   From India,

3  EGYPT. On April 25th, 1917, the War Cabinet directed me

&quot;to inform General Sir A. Murray that he was to take &quot;every favourable opportunity of defeating the &quot;Turkish forces opposed to him and to follow up with &quot;all means at his disposal any success gained with the &quot;object of driving the Turks from Palestine as and &quot;when this bee canes practicable&quot;.

General Sir A. Murray was sent instructions to that effect

the same day (April 25th),

On June 5th, 1917, the War Cabinet decided that:

&quot;General Allenby should be appointed as Commander-in-&quot;Chief of the British Forces in Egypt, and that &quot;arrangements should be made for him to take over the &quot;Command as soon as possible.    Tho policy to be &quot;adopted in th,at theatre of war would not be.settled &quot;until General Allenby had assumed control&quot;.

The Prime Minister has on several recent occasions impressed upon me the neoessity for undertaking a decisive offensive in Palestine, and to assist in doing this, if circumstances permit, the War Office is anxious to send out this month the *f oil owing reinf oroements

Subject, however, to General Allenby!s report, 1 am inclined to think that the decisive defeat of such Turkish troops as may oppose us in Palestine will not be possible unless our own for-aee ara considerably increased beyond those now there or in process of despatch from England and Salonika,, and of course sea transport must be made available for the subsequent effective maintenance of the forces.

4*    SALONIKA,   At the Allied Conference held at Rome early

in January this year the British Government agreed to place

the British Commander tinder the orders of General Sarrail,

At the Conference held at Calais on the 26th February* 1917,

it was agreed between the French and British Governments that

the poiioy should be as follows:

;^As the co-operation of the Russo-Roumanian forces &quot;against Bulgaria is not yet possible, the Conference &quot;agrees to confirm the decision of the Rome Conference, &quot;and decides that, for the present, the decisive defeat &quot;of the Bulgarian Army is not a practical objective, &quot;and that the mission of the Allied forces at &quot;Salonica is to keep on their front the enemy forces &quot;now there, and to take advantage of striking the &quot;enemy if opportunity offers&quot;.

Offensive operations have since been attempted and have failed to give any useful results.     Recently troops have been sent into Greece.     I do not know what General Sarrail&apos;s plans are beyond the employment of theso troops.     The French Government have not told us and General Sarrail has not communicated his intentions to the other Allied Commanders. The French and British Naval Authorities stated at the Conference

is on .May 4th, 1917, that unless the Salonika force was evacuated before the end of the year it would starve there, and that unless a beginning were made at once to reduce the force, it wotHLd be too late. $Jy|

5,     WESTERN FRONT.   On the 21st November last the following communication was received by me from the Secretary of the War Cabinet;

&quot;There is no operation of war to which the War &quot;Committee would attach greater importance than the &quot;successful occupation, or at least the deprivation to &quot;the enemy of xxxxx and especially xxxxxxxxx.

(The names  f the places omitted are known to the War Cabinet),

The necessary instructions were forwarded to the Commander-in-Chief in Prance and a plan was drawn up by him and General Joffro for giving effect to the above policy.

At the Conference held at Rome early in January this year the Allied Ministers agreed that the Military Advisors concerned should confer regarding the feasibility of sending assistanco to Italy for the purpose of a combined offensive being made by the three Allies across the Italian Front. A plan for these operations was prepared by General Cadoraa and forwarded to the Prime Minister,   The gist of it was that 300 heavy guns and eight divisions should be sent to Italy so as to arrive on the 15th February.   This plan was received in London during the last week of January.

In the meantime an Anglo-French Conference had been held in London, on the 15th and 16th January, at which the British and French Governments agreed that all the forces on the Western Front should be employed there in carrying out the plan of offensive operations put forward by General Nivollo, who had recently been appointed French Commandor-in-Chiof, and whoso plans both for offensive operations and for holding the Western Front had been accepted by the British Government.   This policy precluded tho possibility of detaching either French or British troops or guns for offensive operations on tho Italian Front.

On February 27th tho War Cabinet decided to place tho British troops under tho orders of the French Commandor-in-Chiof in matters relating to tho conduct of operations.

The operations took place with the result known, and at

a Conference held in Paris on May 4th and 5th, the following

policy was agreed to r-

&quot;The British and French Governments undertake to &quot;continue the offensive on the Western Front in &quot;accordance with the principles agreed to by Generals &quot;Petain, Nlvelle, Robertson and Field-Marshal &quot;Haig x x x x and to devote the whole of their forces &quot;to this purpose.11 fff|jf

So far as the British Army is concerned it is. now continuing

these operations, and in a direction best suited to give effect

both to the policy agreed upon at Paris and to the Cabinet&apos;s

instructions of November 21st last.     This policy, therefore,

holds the field until cancelled or modified.
