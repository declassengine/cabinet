AGt7/008. DJ^ARTMEHT 0I &apos; IFi&apos;OkliATION

INTELLIGENCE BUREAU.

WEEKLY     REPORT     ON GERMANY.

June   4th to June 11th. 1917

There do not appear to have been any events or any changes in the political situation during the last week to which it is necessary to oall attention.

The Secretary of State for the Colonies, Dr.Solf,

has made an important speech at a meeting of the German

Colonial Association at Leipzig.     In this he asserts the

necessity for regaining the German Colonies:   &quot;I/e want our

colonial possessions back, and 7/e want, as far as possible,

that they shall be territories capable of resistance and of

economic progress&quot;.     To this he adds the following, which

is of importance:

&quot;At the same time we want to do away with any future danger of the peace of Europe being threatened by the militarisation of Africa, as planned by our adversaries on a large scale.     I am glad to say that the whole of the German nation endorses this programme.&quot;

He proceeds to a lengthy comment on Lord Robert Cecil&apos;s speech in the House of Commons on ijay 16. and contrasts the language which he used with that used by General Smuts.     He lays stress on the demand by General bmuts that the formation of black armies be prohibited.     &quot;Against whom is this accusation directed?   Against us, who wanted to keep the Congo Treaty and always advocated peace in Africa, or against English, i&apos;renoh and Belgians, who sent thousands of coloured people of all shades to the European battlefields, and the whole I&apos;rench plan of the introduction of general military service among natives?&quot;

The following passage also occurs:

&quot;I have often Bpoken with Governors of African colonies and also with those of the English colonies, concerning the question as to how to treat netives.     I know what they think about the German policy, but I do not went to mention names, as their acknowledgment of German activity mi^ht expose them to suspicion of high treason, as things now stand.    There is one point I may emphasise:   they oil agreed with me.that the first condition for a sane policy towards the natives in Africa is the maintenance of solidarity and 1 combined action of the white races.     This condition has been destroyed by England&apos;s war policy.     I have proofs at my disposal that many English Governors felt -shocked in their jJUmoost hearts, Just as I did, when, by order of London, they had to excite the coloured people against the v/hite, and when they had to look on in impotent indignation whilst the English military ordered German prisoners to be whipped by, Coloured people.    England&apos;s policy towards the native not pnly prostitutes the position of the white races, but does an injustice to the whole of the black races.    And this&quot; crime is all the mors terrible and the more revolting against the conscience, since it is Great Britain, who is proud of ^er race, who bears the guilt.&quot;

The speech is an important one and some answer will

probably be necessary to it.     It will, however, be desirable

to wait .until we have received a full copy of the speech in the

original German, as it is impossible to depend entirely upon

the translations conveyed in telegraphic summaries.     It may be

added that Dr. Solf himself has a high reputation;   as Secretary

of State for the Colonies be did much to remove some of the

worst elements in the treatment of the natives;   he has had-

personal experience in the colonies, and, before the war, his

relations to the English colonial authorities were, I am told,

friendly.
