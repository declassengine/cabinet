COMMITTEE OF REFERENCE,-8-11 Queen Square, W.C. 1

7th June, 1917

Sir,

By direction of the Committee of Reference, I have the honour to forward to you the enclosed copy of a Moiib&apos;r&amp;ndum&apos; on the present arrangements for treating sick and wounded officers in small sectional or auxiliary Officers&apos; Hospitals, and to request that it may be considered.

The Secretary, War Cabinet.

M1M0RAMDUM- on the present arrangement for treating sick and wounded Officers in small-sectional or auxiliary Officers&apos; Hospitals.

1, It is the duty of the Committee of Reference, in deciding whether a member of the Staff of a London Hospital can be spared, to consider the needs cf the civil population and to&quot; prevent the Staff of each Hospital from being depleted to such an extent as to endanger the supply of Medical and Surgical treatment for the civil.community,

2. The constant demand for doctors for the Army has necessitated the revision from time to time by the Committee of Reference of the standard of indisp ens ability of members of Hospital staffs. &quot;-

3. The depletion of the staffs has now reach a point, at Which some reorganisation of hospital arrangements is urgently called for with a view to. economy in man-poweri  

4, The Committee are of opinion that one cause, of .  i,. unnecessary expenditure of man-power is the system which has been adopted, and is still being continued, -of establishing small Officers&apos; Hospitals in London and throughout the country. They are fully aware of the fact that the establishment of these small hospitals is due to the patriotism and self-sacrifice of those who have, eontribut ed  .so liberally by devoting their houses, their fund3 and their personal servioe to- the cause of   their country;    and they feel that&apos; any suggestion for the modification&apos;Of -the present&apos; syst em :may cause&apos; pain and disappointment. At the same time, &apos;owing to- the prolonged and uncertain duration,-; of the War, and the drain, on the Medioal Prof ession., the &apos; question should he treated&apos;from an impersonalstandpoint&quot;&apos;.and every .means; taken to diminish waste of time and labour with a view to obtaining the most efficient   treatment .at the smallest cost of effort.

I am, etc.

Secretary.


5. At the present time there are in the London Command alone at least 58 Sectional or Auxiliary Officers* Hospitals, each containing less than 100 beds.     Only 8 contain more than 40 &quot;beds, 5 contain between 30 and 40, 25 contain between 20

and 30, and 20 contain 20 or less.     Attached to these hospitals as visiting staffs there are, excluding Dentists, approximately 300 members of the medical profession*.

6. _    The number of these Hospitals is so considerable in proportion to that of physicians, surgeons and others upon whom they depend for their visiting staffs, that the same visiting Medical Officer is often attached to several of these institutions,     Ke is thus called upon to visit very small groups of patients - and even isolated individuals - who may be some miles apart.from each other, and this involves waste both of time and energy.     And it should be remembered that the same waste of time and energy are involved in the administration of anaesthetics,

in the work of the laboratories, in the X-Ray and in other Bpecial departments.     An example may be given of a surgeon on the staff of a General Hospital, and of a Children1 s&apos; Hospital, who visits one Officers1 Hospital in Bayswater of 40 beds, two in the S.W.-District of 28 and 30 beds, one in the Western District of 20 beds and one in the NCW. District of 30 beds. &apos;&lt; \-V.

7  -   Further, the small size of these hospitals&apos; places out of the question, in most cases, the provision of a Resident Medical Officer who, in larger hospitals, relieves the Visiting Medical Officers of a great, deal of routine work,

Q.     This multiplication of small hospitals also involves the employment of an excessive number of nurses,&quot;    Whereas in a large specially constructed hospital one.nurse can attend to an average of ;14-patients, in some of the converted private houses the propor tion of nurses is very much higher,; because&apos; the rooms are small and distributed on many floors.     Hence, so far from the nurses being   underworked, it is precisely in these small hospitals that they suffer from long hours and shortage of holidays.     The Committee do not, however, propose to deal with this question^ as they understand that it has already been considered to some extent by a special advisory Committee, appointed. by the Army Council.

9.     The system of small hospitals also leads to wasteful equipment.     There is no real selection of patients.     In order to be prepared for the reception of severe cases each hospital has to be supplied with all the arrangements for any operation, and for special nursing;J| and these may very seldom be required.

1&lt;K     The Committee venture to make the following suggestions in the belief that their adoption will result in an economy of effort combined with a higher standard of efficiency;-

(a) That all serious cases should be treated in large hospitals, v .

(b) That in the event of ii being found impossible to treat all serious cases of sick and wounded officers in the established Military Hospitals, provision should be made for their treatment in other large Hospitals, grouped, as far as is possible, in circum- . scribed areas...   For example,, it is suggested that two large General Hospitals in close proximity, such as

S. Thomas&apos;s and Westminster, might be taken over for one area.   $he civil and military beds in these two Hospitals amount to 1200,  ; ;:&apos; . Wm

(c) That these Hospital groups should be staffed by a sufficient number of doctors who should work together as one unit.


73

(d)   That the^e should be a sufficient number of Resident Medical Officers.&apos;

11*     In putting forward these recommendations the Committee desire to state that they recognise that there are certain larger Officers&apos; Hospitals which have Resident Medical Officers, and which are doing such good work that they should not pe interfered with;    With respect / however, to small OfficersrHoa itala.,. if it-is decided t&apos;o retain them&apos; at all;, it is suggested that they should be utilised only for convalescent patients, transferred from, the larger hospitals,&apos; and they should be grouped- into areas and should be visited by Medical Officers appointed for each area*
