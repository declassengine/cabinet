WEEKLY REPORT ON BULGARIA. IX. June 15, 1917,

Bulgaria&apos;s insistence on Continued Connection with Central Europe.

It has been pointed out in several of my recent Reports, especially Nos. 5 and 7, that Bulgarian politicians and propagandists are paying special attention to the exploitation and Bulgarisation of the North-East corner of Serbia, generally known as the Morava Valley, because theftrepresents to them not only a rich mining district which will prove a great source of wealth to them in the future, but also the essential link with Austria-Hungary and Germany.     Further evidence is now to hand to confirm this view.     The Pester Lloyd of June 1 published an interview of its correspondent, the well-known novelist&apos;Roda Roda&quot;, with Radoslavov in Sofia on May 23, in which the latter, after some enthusiastic references to Austria-Hungary, concluded: &quot;To-day we are Austria-Hungary&apos;s neighbours and we will and must remain so for all time&quot;.      Some days later, in an interview he gave to the Berlin correspondent of the Vienna Fremdenblatt in the course of his journey to Germany, Mr Radoslavov used these words:-&quot;We want that part of Macedonia which is already occupied by our troops.   We further want for all time security, and we want to keep in touch with Austria-Hungary through the Morava Valley. Finally we demand Dobrogea&quot;.

Still more important is the interview given by Dr Sakarov, one of the &quot;Broad&quot; Socialist members of the Delegation in Stockholm, to the Swedish Liberal paper Dagens Nyheter.     I have already referred to this in Report No.7, but was then able only to quote the version of the interview which appeared in the

Dally Telegraph (May 25), and which con&quot;tained Sakarov&apos;s declaration that though Bulgarian Socialists- had the same views about peace without annexations as the German Socialists, they of course demanded Dobrogea and Macedonia as Bulgarian countries. This version has, however, omitted the most interesting and significant part of the interview.   The Utro (May 27) publishes a fuller

ccount.   After giving the passages quoted by the Daily Telegraph, it goes on as follows{-     &quot;Even 15 days before the intervention of Bulgaria in the war the Entente offered us the whole of Macedonia&quot;.   Then comes the crucial passage: &quot;Asked if the Bulgarians want the Timok Valley in order to have a common frontier with the Danube Monarchy, Dr Sakarov replied that from the Socialist point of view this question is by no means a sine qua non condition of peace, but in any case Bulgaria ought to receive at least a corridor between Or ova and Lom-Palanka, which necessitates her being given the district of Negotln1&apos;.

This interesting confirmation of the conjecture put forward in Report No.5, page i, shows that all political parties in Bulgaria, with the exception of the &quot;Narrow&quot; Socialists, are agreed as to the necessity of continuing in close political and economic connection with the Central Powers.   Dr Sakarov did not venture to adduoe any racial grounds why the district of Negotin, the population of which is Serbian and Rumanian, should be joined to Bulgaria.   For the moment Bulgarian propagandists find it advisable to be discreet in their references to the subject when dealing with public opinion in Neutral and Entente countries.   It is interesting to notice that German propagandists also find it advisable not to refer to the question of the Morava Valley, but concentrate on the &quot;Bulgarian character&quot; of Macedonia and Dobrogea.   For instance, in a German wireless message of June 11, while there is much talk of Radoslavov&apos;s demands for liacedonia and Dobrogea as Bulgarian country.

there is no allusion to the Morava Valley (or any part of it such as the district of Negotin), T7hich clearly cannot be described as racially Bulgarian.   Yet the point is of vital Importance.     Bulgarian papers continue to be full of accounts of the propagandist work, educational and administrative, which is being carried on by the Bulgarian authorities in the Morava Valley.   Examples of this have already been quoted passim in previous Reports.

Bulgarian Administration in Dobrogea.

In Report No.8 the interest shown in the Bulgarisation of the occupied province of Dobrogea was described. Further Bulgarian papers to hand contain additional descriptions of the Bulgarian character of the whole province.   As in occupied Serbia the Bulgarian authorities are setting up schools everywhere In Dobrogea, even so far North as Tulcea and Isaccea on the Danube.    In Isaccea, for instance, a new school dedicated to Tsar Asparukh was lately opened, and the utro assures its readers splendid results have already been obtained and that the pupils are already acquiring great proficiency in their &apos;&apos;natural&quot; language, Bulgarian, which is coming to its own in this province, described by the utro as &quot;the furthest Northern boundary of to-day&apos;s united Bulgaria&quot;.
