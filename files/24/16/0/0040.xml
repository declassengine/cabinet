WORKING     CLASSES     IN GERMANY.

The following interesting account has been received from a usually reliable source

Mr. a..., a Dutch technical expert, who since November last has been responsible foi the technical management of the Vereinigte .filectro teohnische Institut, grankfurt-Aschaffen-burg &gt; has returned here on a fortnight&apos;s leave to recover from what he called his &quot;chronical disease of hunger&quot;.     Though a Dutch citizen, Mr. a., was only allowed to leave C-enaany upon an undertaking hy his employers that they would fully guarantee his good behavioue abroad and that his stay in Holland was in the &quot;interest of the otate&quot;.     Permits to leave Germcny are now only being given by the Minister of War and exclusively for purposes connected with the interest of the State.     In the case of Mr. X.. it was maintained that he would open new facilities for the export of German ^oods to Holland and it is interesting to note his instructions.     Exports to neutral countries have to be invoiced in the currency of the importing country and permit to export is only given upon the undertaking that, the payment is to be made to the Valutaoentrale in Berlin, whioh pays the exporter in Marks at the normal exchange; the enormous difference between the normal rate and that of the present-depreciation of the Mark going to the Treasury.

Mr. Z&apos;s factories have, for the greater part, been adapsfied i&lt;a1* ffitaition work besides which medieal instruments for hospitals,,,a%se being produced.     During his six months&apos; stay in G&amp;naa&apos;nV;^ my Informant-has erected many factories in the koufh, in*Saxony and in&quot;&apos;Berlin.     He has an intimate and

extensive experience of the conditions of the working classes and, I think, that as an observer be may be well trusted. Before he left in November he was strong and healthy looking; now he has the aspect of a JJI1I141 &quot;i&quot;p.

His first subject is that of hunger.   The greatest calamity seems to be insufficient quantity of bread which is made out of a mixture of turnips, oats and roughly ground grains. The prioe is 57 pfennig the two pounds, which have to last for 7 days.     The other rations for the week are:   1 pound of potatoes, 200 grammes of meat and 100 grammes of &quot;Teigwaaren&quot;, meaning either grit (?) or macaroni, or similar foodstuffs. Fat and butter are not to be had;   maggarine, in very inferior quality, only by chance.     For all other articles of human food there are only substitutes.    The whole German world is moving under the sign of Ersatz, and the result is the alarmingly in-oreasing mortality of old people and children.     During the last few weeks another symptom of the populations* decreasing stamina has been noticeable - in the factories workmen faint away, exhibiting all signs of perfect exhaustion.     They have to be taken to hospitals and have to be nursed for weeks ere they become fit for work again.     Yet, the wages are not high as compared with those abroad.     For a ten hours&apos; day work, workmen are being paid from 35 to 55 marks per week and for night work, from 45 to 75 marks.     Women earn from 24 to 40 marks per week.     But the money is spent as soon as received; there is no thrift and the working-classes are worse off than In peaoe time.

How does this material condition react upon the spirits?    The German workman is still as meek as he UBed to be before the war.     He still stands at attention when spoken to by what he believes to be his superior.     But he is full of

hatred of the Prussian officialdom (Beamtentum). He speaks bitterly of &quot;Herr Lehmann&quot; (the old nickname for the Kaiser) and he no longer idolises Hindenburg.     Only a few weeks ago, after the strikes in munition factories all over the country, large posters were distributed in tLe factories containing Hingenburg&apos;s letter to the workmen .     They bore, in large letters, the heading: &quot;HOrt, was Hindenburg Euch zuruft&quot; but the placards were torn down as soon as they were fixed up amidst derisioni     Great pressure is being brought upon the workmen to subscribe to the War-Loan;   but they refuse to do so, whilst they make very liberal gifts to the various &quot;U-Boot Sammlungen&quot; - collections for the building of submarines.

The fact is, the German workman has lost his confidence in the Army* but he still believes what he is told about the amazing results of the submarine &quot;warfare&quot;. The workman is told, and he believes it, that England will be starved to capitulation by September and that then Germany will get the peace she wants.     German industry will be more flourishing than ever and the workmen will live in an Eldorado.     This confidence ^ives him backbone and the moral force to bear his present lot.     Yet, there are grave symptoms of demoralising influences being at work. Explosions in munition factories, especially in those situated in Berlin and Saxony, are alarmingly increasing in npmber and they mostly occur in the hours of.meals or between two shifts, when there are only few people near by.     Soldiers on leave do not salute their superiors in the streets and the officers are careful not to give provocation by pretending not to notice that in peace time,would be considered to be a criminal offence.

Is there any chance of a revolution?

Hot now; the German workman will suffer for another few months being convinoed that the autumn Will see a change of the situation. He has been told that the Russians ore out of the fight and that the Americans are far away. Yet, he does not believe in the victory of the Army hut he obstinately clings to his hope of seeing England on her knees before long. This, with the fervour of a fanatic who stakes all his

faith upon one aim.     Again there is btockholm, a name which has magic power just now in Germany.     The German workman is rather proud of what he believes to be a fact, that his own people will make the peace and, consequently, reap the benefits. Germany will be a Social-Democratic State after the war - about this he has no doubt.     He is overfed with illusions and it is in his nature to feast upon them, especially in times whem enjoyments of a more material kind are hopelessly out of his reach.     Yet, the very sustaining power of these illusions makes them dangerous.     It is inconceivable that these people, who will be utterly exhausted, perhaps even decimated, by September should be able quietly to bear the cruel disillusion that is awaiting them.     As soon as they will be aware of the futility of the submarine campaign as well as of the failure of the Stockholm enterprise, there will be only a leader needed to rouse them.     They know that the German Government can no longer rely upon the army at home who are sure to join the cause of the people.     The Russian example has done very much to enlighten the population but the patriotic feeling is still strong enough to give the Government a last ohence of fulfilling their promise in connexion with, the submarine business.     If they cannot redeem their pledge by the autumn, then there will undoubtedly be a revolution.     &quot;I am absolutely sure that Germany will not be able to enter a new winter campaign and I

have reason for believing that the Government loio^/ it too .

But there are other points to sustain this opinion. It is no secret in Germany that the extraordinary drought hr.s greatly imperilled this year&apos;s crop,   in Germany, Austria-Hungary and in the occupied territories, the drought fcas abnormal to an extent that even optimistic experts do not venture to foretell as muoh as a bad middling crop.     It is to be feared that the crop in the South-Lastem countries will not be sufficient for the people there and there seems, r.t present scarcely a reasonable hope of an export to Germany.

Again, the system of&quot;substitutes&quot; is far from being a success.     It has shown its injurious effect upon the population and it is now -proving a failure in connexion with maohinery,     &quot;The use of substitutes for lubricating oil has in our factories and in many others I have inspected, had the disastrous effect of ruining the machines, partly by rusting and partly by clogging, so that they can only be used by suffer ing enormous delay in the best oase.     Most of the machines have become entirely useless for the work they are designed for and the Government are unable to replace them.     Nor can we get the necessary raw material.     &apos;.&lt;e have to take zinc for copper and thus produoe inferior articles which have to be replaced within a short time if they can be efficiently used at all.    How that even the private houses have been deprived of the last shreds of copper, it is difficult to see how we shall be able to manage in future.     iivery ounce of energy has been strained to the utmost limit and one always fears a sudden collapse.     Yet it will probably take some more time till it occurs.     But no serious observer would feel safe in saying that Germany would be able to enter a new winter campaign.     Neither the people nor the resources will stand it.
