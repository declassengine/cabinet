15th June, 1917.

I am informed &quot;by an officer that not long ago 2 Germans attempting to fraternise with Russians were made prisoners on Northern front.   On investigations being made it was ascertained that both were officers of German General Staff dressed as soldiers.   Some officer also told me that a divisional commander in 5th Army was shot by his men for being strict.   I do not possess official confirmations of these statements.   I spoke last night at a mating of a new organisation called the Military league.    Its object is to increase the (three groups omitted} and it has no politics.

The Provisional Government has to-day issued a declaration that they have received information from the front of (?) serious Military crimes committed not only by men but units, such as disobedience to orders with resistance amounting to mutiny, leaving the trenches without leave, refusal to obey orders and take part in fighting, etc.   Provisional Government points out that offenders will be punished by penal servitude and deprivation of all rights and that affected units will be disbanded immediately.   Commanders are ordered to bring offenders immediately to trial.     That such a declaration should have to be made public shows the extent to which discipline has gone.

The Government are also beginning to adopt a more determined attitude.   A show of real firmness on part of the Government would have the very best effect in other directions as well as in the Army.   Kerenski has also issued an order showing how criminal it is for soldiers to trade in provisions

with Germans at a time when the country is in such need.
