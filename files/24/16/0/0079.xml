Russian Armies        5 I in the Field.

10*5-1917? To

The Minister of War.

8ir,

I herewith enclose a copy of an application submitted &quot;by me through the recognised channels.     I have at the same time addressed a copy of my application with a copy of this letter to the British Ambassador.

From the contents of my application you will see that my object is te be allowed to fight in the ranks of the British Army.     Legally, of course, there is no ground to my claim. But there is another side to this question which, in my opinion, deserves as much consideration as if the question were considered from a strictly legal standpoint, and it is to this side of the question that I am anxious should be given full consideration.

My parents are English, and I amthe only Russian subject in our family.     I was naturalised as a Russian subject at the age of 17, for practical reasons, viz. because I wished to enter the Military Academy of Medicine at Petrograd.

Since August 7th 1914 I served as a doctor in the reserve of the Russian Amy, convinced as I was that I was serving the common cause of the Allies and not furthering the interests of national aims.     At the present moment Russia has, in truth, ceased fighting, for the fact that not all the troops have as yet been &quot;evacuated&quot; to the real? is by no means a proof that we are, still carrying on the war. ^ Being all the time in immediate touch with the fighting line, living one life with the soldiers, we have no occasion to doubt that all hope of re-establishing an army capable of fighting, i.e. taking the offensive, is at an end.     Only hopeless optimists and cranks can imagine that the

/raw


raw, utterly uncivilised masses of our troops are capable of oonoeiving the necessity of a victory over the German imperialism, and aro able to sacrifice their own interests for the sake of mankind.    Knowing tho front as wo know it, we are unable to dream of suoh things, unless the stick should again hang over the Russian soldier.    And even then it is a question what his choice would bo2   to fight tho Germans or to fight that stick {should even tho latter be used by tho Social* Democratic Party).

In actuality wo have already stopped tho war with Germany, i.e. wo have become traitors to the great oause of the coalition of the Allies.     But. there are yet many people in Russia who do not desire to be traitors, who wish to fight with the Prussian Yunkerism and Militarism to the finish in order to free humanity from this &apos;Sword of Democl^s1.     It stands to reason that it is impossible to go on fighting in the condition our army is at present.    When every order is being &apos;filtered* by a committee of Semi-literate soldiers who never miss the opportunity of insulting or discrediting their chiefs, when the majority of the soldiers think it a virtue to show their contempt for the &quot;goaler*   (see the IZVBSTIA. of the Council of *f.M, &amp; S.D. of 5W5-I.7)   there can be no talk of an &apos;Army&apos;or of &apos;War* or of any productive work.

I always was an&lt;i always will be an Englishman at heart. And what an Englishman values most is being able to keep his word). This is, in fact, exactly what I ASK YOU.     Make it possible for.;m% to keep my vow, the vow of a Russian doctor:   to try and prevent the hegemony $f German imperialism in Surope.     I have been doings this in the Russian Army for 2i years.     It is impossible to do this now or in th  future.     I am an Wngllataman - and make it possible for m  to Join the Army which is akin to me in spirit and nationality, and to fight in its ranks till complete victory is won over the common foe.
