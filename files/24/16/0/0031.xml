tTeekly Report 6n Poland. (13th Juno, 1917.)

On May 1 the Polish Council of State had demanded from tho Central Powers the appointment of a Regent and the handing over of the government and administration of the Kingdom of Poland to the Poles themselves.     On May 15 the representatives of the Central Powers had promised an answer from the Central Powers within a few days.     The Council of State meantime decided to suspend its activities until such an answer was received. MThe Times&quot; of Juno 11 publishes in an Amsterdam wir3 the text of the answer given by the Central Powers to the Polish Council of Stato on June 9.     It is most non-coroiittal and practioally the only concession contained in it is a clear though theoretical acknowledgment of the Council of State   as a body fit to direct the administration of the country; the Decreo of Nov. 26, 1916, on which its existence is based, conceded to it merely advisory functions in so far as administration i3 concerned.     In tho first paragraph of the answer the Central Powers agree in theory to a Regent who is to be appointed &quot;as soon as the conditions for tho successful activity of a Regent ore created*1;     It thu3 remains with the Central Powers to determine the date at which the appointment is to be made.     As definite negotiations for tho appointment of a Regent are knffjgh to nave Taken place between the C entral Powers, it may be. assumed that this postponment marks another deadlock in their attempts to reach aft understanding on tho Polish Question.     In the second paragraph of the answer the Central Powers declare that they regard the Provisional Council

of State as representing the future Polish State, and that they expoct it to complete &quot;in as short a time as possible the preparatory work for the organisation of the Constitution and the administration of the Kingdom of Poland&quot;.     The Council of State had been threatening to dissolve if no satisfactory answer were given by the Central Powers; paragraph 2 is obviously an attempt to keep them busy and to render it difficult for them to carry out their threat.     In the third and last paragraph the Central Powers request the Council of State &quot;to prepare and submit to the Central Powers special proposals as to how, without prejudice to the position to which the Central Powers were entitled according to international law, the handing over of the individual branches of administration to the Polish authroities can be effected&quot;. In other words the Central Powers declare themselves prepared to start negotiations on the subject, but under a very big reserve -in fact under a theoretical reserve much wider than the Central Powers would ever think of actually claiming - as obviously the rights of belligerents in occupation of enemy country,are very extensive and, if enforced in full, would render any Polish State independence impossible.     What the negotiations v/ith the Central Powers for the handing over of any branch of the administration mean is best shown by those concerning the Departments of Education and Justice to the Council of State.     After having promised

towards the end of March and in tshe beginning of April to hand/ove r to the ^Council of State   the occupying Powers, after having raised various difficulties concerning details, declared through their representatives of April 25 that this could only be done by rescripts from the two Emperors, and that such rescripts cannot be asked for until it is evident that the Council of State is capable of taking over the task, that it has a sufficient staff of trained officers, etc..     In 3hort, in the past any negotiations of this

kind were used by the Central Powers to delay matters.     In view of thoeo past experiences it 1*3 certain that the answer of the Central Powers will be considered most unsatisfactory both by the Council of State and by public opinion i.i Poland.

soma concession, though not a concession of any considerable importance.     This personage is to preside over the Polish administration, not over the administration in Poland; in other words, he will have as much administrative power as the Central Powers will agree to hand over to the Poles, but he will have no control over the German and Austrian Governor-Generals and the occupjin^ authorities, which would have had to be conceded to a Regent and a regular Polish government*
