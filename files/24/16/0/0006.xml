CONTROL OF PETROL &amp; PETROLEUM PRODUCTS.

(Memorandum &quot;by Mir.Long with reference to War Cabinet 142, Minute 10)

Prime Minister.

  -   - ^

In accordance with your instructions.I have investigated the question of the control of Petrol and Petroleum Products.     I find everything in great confusion, and there can he no doubt that tho situation must be full of anxiety for some time.

You desired me to deliver a decision.     I therefore propose the arrangements set forth in the accompanying memorandum, and which have the assent of Sir Albert Stanley, Dr.Addison and Captain Protyman.

(Initialled) W.H.Ii.

PETROL AMD PETROLEUM PRODUCTS.

I have looked into the question of petrol and found it necessary to include other petroleum products in my investigation.     The Prime Minister agreed to my doing so. I have discussed matters with the Heads of the departments and committees concerned and my proposals arg* generally agreed to. I have found great confusion and overlapping and no difeot responsibility.     The difficulty which led to the present crisis has arisen through the existence of two independent committees with contradictory references end spheres of action that overlap, and the lack of any authority to decide between the committees and departments concerned.

My decision is to cancel the references of the Petrol Committee   and the Inter-departmental Committee and make a fresh start with the following organisation to deal with all petroleum products:-

(l) TfO set up four bodies viz.

(a)\ An inter-departmental committee of representatives of all departments now represented on the present committee, with the addition of the Board of Agriculture.     This Committee will bo advisory to all departments concerned with petroleum products. Itwill collect information and co-ordinate departmental action, but will have no executive functions.

. (b)   The Petrol Coscaittee to be re-appointed by the     Board of Trade to regulate the distribution of petrol for civil and industrial needs.

(c)   The Pool Board, a voluntary combination of petroleum companies to economise man-power and material, under an independent Chairman, appointed by the Government.     This Board will be placed under the 3oard of Trade instead of the Ministry of Munitions as at present.


(d)      A Production Department to stimulate home production.     This Department to he attaohed to the Ministry of Munitions.

(II) The Chairmen of the above bodies will constitute a Committee, under the presidency of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, for the discussion and settlement of difficulties.

(III) There will he a Controlling Authority to decide any dispute between departments or committees and to arrange for executive action which in his opinion ought to be taken by departments concerned.     The decision of the Controlling Authority will be final on all matters, except in case of interference with the needs of the fighting departments, when he would refer to the War Cabinet.     This Controlling Authority will bo the Secretary of State for tho Colonics.     He will

have a liaison offioer to keep him in touch with all departments and committees concerned,

I believe that this asheme, under which the distribution of petroleum products for civil and industrial needs at   home will be brought under the Board of Trade, will prevent a recurrence of the recent difficulties and that it will ensure that a comprehensive view will be taken of all petroleum questions and that the work of the various bodies set up will be properly co-ordinated and sny approach to dead-lock prevented.
