SECRET.

G.T. - 1063 WAR CABINET,

POWERS OF THE COMMITTEE OF ACCOlffiOrATION. (Note &quot;by Sir Alfred Mond)

The Warr.Cab4ne

In reference to my memorandum of the 24th May, (Paper No. G.Ti 1019   Appendix)    I wish to point out to the War Cabinet that at the time this memorandum was submitted, the state* ment&apos;-MBde that there were difficult matters of accommodation pending between the Foreign Office, and the Colonial Office for solution was merely cited as an example, and I am glad to say that.since then this matter has been satisfactorily solved. Thin does not, however, detract from the force of the memorandum which I submitted, or the urgency of the question, as numerous proposals of a similar acute character are daily arising, and a great deal of delay is caused by the present method of procedure, which is the only way open.
