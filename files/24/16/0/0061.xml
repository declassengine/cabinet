Report for Week ending Wednesday, June 13, 1917.

PART I. ACTION TAKEN.

Control of Prices and Sdpplies.

Sugar. The Sugar (Domestic Preserving) Order, 1917, dated June 11, 1917, prohibits the use for any other purpose of sugar issued by the Sugar Commission for the purpose of the domestic preserving of fruit. Vendors are required to state clearly on every invoice or package that the sugar sold by them may only be used for&apos; this purpose, and they may only sell it to persons who have made formal application to the Commission, or whom they believe on reasonable groxmds to need sugar for the domestic preserving of fruit. The enforcement of this Order is entrusted to the local authorities, and the wrongful acquisition of any such sugar is made a summary offence.

The quantity of American white sugar purchased in order to meet the requirements of home preserving has been increased to 25,000 tons. Some of this has already arrived, and it is hoped that the bulk will be got over safely. Sugar is now being moved into the hands of retailers to be ready for use next week, when .strawberries will be plentiful. Priority is being given to private growers of fruit who have made written applications on forms officially supplied, and lodged by them with their grocers. l*f;?l

During the week three more stigar cargoes, aggregating some 16,000 tons, have been sunk, bringing up the total losses since the beginning of February to 80,000 tons.

At the instance of the Controller of Shipping, arrangements have, been made by which sugar skips Will receive instructions as to1 their port of discharge before leaving their final port of sailing, instead of being given their orders on their approach to our shores. The change has been advocated by the Shipping Controller for the purpose of avoiding the delay that calling at Queeristown or elsewhere for orders tends to cause.

With reference to the subject of sugar purchases in the East, the Treasury has authorised a further credit of 2,000,000L for purchases iri Java. The question of making purchases in Mauritius remains undetermined.

fi&apos;^r . Cereals. -Mr..Hoover again cabled .from. Washington to the effect that, while Captain Bathurst&apos;s statement had done good, he would be grateful for further official expressions of anxiety as to the resources and ability of the United States in respect of food supplies to the Allies. Tt was, therefore, arranged that statements should be made for insertion in the American Press by the President of the Board of Agriculture, and by the Chairman of the Wheat Executive, indicating that until a decision had been reached in America no comprehensive agricultural programme could be formulated here. .,

The Food Controller has authorised the Board of Agriculture to buy parcels of corn for seed purposes at prices slightly in excess of those fixed by the Maximum Prices Order, and this decision has now been publicly announced.

The Crops (1917) Committee is considering alternative schemes for the disposition and control of the grain and potato crops with incidental reference to the fixing of prices.

The Flour Mills Control Committee have decided that, in order to encourage wholemeal bread, whenever not less than 95 per cent, extraction is made from wheat, the admixture of other cereals should not be compulsory. It is proposed, in order to effect a more uniform colour of flour, that all imported flour should be passed through the hands of millers so that. it can be blended and diluted in the same way as Government Regulation flour.

,. Meat. The Meat (Sales) Order has stopped speculation in live animals and limited the profits of wholesale butchers.. The completion of this policy by fixing

prices is a matter of considerable difficulty.   Where, as in this case, the feeding of the people depends on absolutely -regular supply by farmers, throughout the country, of a certain number of beasts every week, it is evident that a mistake might have a disastrous effect. If farmers generally held their stock off the markets for one week (which they could easily do without much risk or loss) no subsequent action, however prompt or&apos;drastic, would satisfy the public.   It has been necessary, therefore, to interview representatives of all interests, and to examine, as closely as possible, the varying conditions in all parts of the country. A scheme has been prepared which, if adopted, will, it is believed, prove successful.

Fish: Members of the Fish Committee have visited Billingsgate and other fish markets for the purpose of ascertaining what, if any, regulations can be recommended, in order to steady and regulate; the prices of.fjsh.

Enforcement of Orders.

An Order was made by the Food Controller on the 11th June empowering Inspectors of Weights and Measures and their&apos; Assistants to take samples of flour, to require tea to be weighed, and to prosecute&apos;for offences against the Bread Order, the Cake and Pastry Order, the Tea&apos;(Nett Weight) Order, and Article 5 of the Manufacture of rFlour and Bread Order (No. 2), 1917. The advisability of defining the spheres of action of these inspectors, the local.authorities and the police is under examination.

Reports from the Inspectorif or this Ministry indicate that in the principal towns considerable energy has been displayed in securing enforcement of. vthe Food Controller&apos;s Orders, e.g., in Sheffield the Town Clerk has set up an organisation to enforce &apos;the Orders and the entire staff of the Weights and Measures Inspectors, the Cleansing Department and the Shops Acts Inspectors are employed on these duties, while the Lady Health Visitors have been asked to report contraventions. Various Trade Associations have also undertaken to report contraventions in their respective trades and have circulated printed statements explaining the Food Controller&apos;s Orders. In rural districts progress is less satisfactory, mainly owing to inadequate staff, aud it Will probably be found necessary to institute some more effective. measure of local control.

_ r A case of the-waste of bread by its use in feeding poultry, reported to this .Ministry by the National War Savings Committee, has ended in a conviction with a penalty of 501.&quot;and 151. 15s. costs. c.&quot;

The first prosecution under the Oat and Maize Products {Retail Prices) Order, 1917, was heard at Middlesbrough &quot;where a trader was convicted for! selling maize &apos;flakes at 4-|&lt;i. per lb., and fined 21.

Investigations show that the. Public Meals. Qrdec has .been generally obeyed in .&apos;the matter of meat f-nd flour, but that;the consumption of sugar frequently exceeds Jthe permissible&apos; quantity. One prominent London club, which was inspected during the week, professed entire ignorance of the Order, and had not opened the register. The attention of the local authority of theare&amp;in which most of&apos; the clubs are situated has been drawn to the necessity of inspection.

PART II.-SUMMARY OF FOOD POSITION.

Imports of food showed a further decline during the week ended 9th June, the total  quantity ef the principal foods and feeding-stuffs received (Table A) being 201,500 tons, &apos;compared with 231,OlX) tons in the previous week, 306,01 &gt;0 tons in the corresponding week of 1916, and a&apos;w&apos;eeMy* average of 207,000 tons since the beginning of the year. There was a heavy fall in. the imports, of-, sugar (which, amounted to less than 10,000 &quot;tons, compared With nearly 20,000 tons in the previous week, 34,000 tons m the corresponding week of 1916,. and a weekly average, this year, of nearly 22,000 tons), and there were substantial reductions in those of oats (3,500 tons, against 11,700 tons id the previous Week, 41,000 tons in the corresponding week of last year, and ah &apos;average of 6,800, tons this year), and maize (28,0^fph ;iepmpared with 3-1,500 tons last week, and an average of 34,000 tons).   The rni^o^tS of barley,..mutton, lard, cheese, butteri, margarine,&quot; and glucose*&apos;Were also Considerably below the average, .those, of margarine especially being very small (520 tons; &apos;compared with an average -hl&apos;2^80 tons this year};&apos;-1 The aimpdrteTO&amp; wheat and fl(asr, on the other hand, though ythey fell far short of th^:high!point reached in the correspoffdibg^^ttfeek of1916, were


188

gs a

maintained at a level considerably above the average for earlier weeks of this year, and the quantities of bacon and hams received also showed noticeable increases.

The total imports of fifteen of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs since the beginning of the year now amount to 4,767,000 tons, compared with 5,329,000 tons in the corresponding period of 1916, a deficiency of 562,000 tons or i Of per cent.-The. articles mainly responsible for the reduction are sugar (206,000 tons), barley (178,000 tons), wheat (177,000 tons), oats (150,000 tons), and whealen flour (43,000 tons). The total imports of beef, mutton, hams, and margarine are also considerably below*&quot; those for the corresponding period of last year. The imports of maize, however, are greater by 206,000 tons, and there are substantial increases in the imports of lard, butter, and cheese.

Consumption of Meat and Bread. *p rfpj

Meat. The average weekly supplies of dead meat entering the markets at London, Manchester, Liverpool, and Glasgow, (Table B), during May, were in each case less than in any previous month of 19 L 7. As compared with April, the aggregate decrease amounted to 10 per cent. Compared with May, 1916, the supplies at London and Manchester were lower by 10 per cent, and 5 per cent., but at Glasgow and Liverpool they were higher by 3 per cent, and 4 per cent, respectively, the totals for all the markets showing a fall of 7| per cent.

In the week ended 9th June, the supplies in London .were 18 per cent, below those of the corresponding week last year, but showed an increase of nearly 6 per cent, on the average for May.

The supplies of fat cattle received at 51 markets in Great Britain during the week ended 6th June (Table C), were 15 per cent, lower than the average for May,| and 0 per cent, lower than the average for the corresponding weeks in 1914-16. The supplies of fat sheep were also less by 25 per cent, than in the corresponding weeks in the three previous years, and showed a slight reduction on the average for May, 1917. The supplies of fat pigs, on the other hand, were 1 per cent, above thes average for May, but showed a decrease of 4 per cent, on the average for the corresponding weeks in 1914-16.

Bread. In the Report for last week, figures were given showing the quantity of flour used for bread making and confectionery, in the four weeks ended 26th May, as, indicated by returns furnished by 612 bakers.   Returns have since been received from 78 more firms and the figures for the whole 690 firms are shown below : -

Four weeks ended Mav 26th, 1917   - - - 211,687

Four weeks ended April 28th, 191.7 - - 220,418-

Four weeks ended May 27th, 19J6   - - -o 211,125

The revised figures agree with those given last week in indicating a decrease of about 4 per cent, during May, as compared with the preceding month, which also showed a similar decrease compared with March. Compared with May, 1916, however, the figures show a fractional increase, instead of a decrease of nearly 1 per cent, as shown by the 612 returns summarised last week. This difference is mainly due to the receipt of returns from Scotland which show considerable increases of. consumption.

As was pointed out in the last report, these figures must be considered with due. regard to the acute shortage of potatoes, and to the fact that last year May showed a, slight increase in consumption over April.

The following Table shows the course of consumption last year and this, taking March, 1917, (the first month for which substantial returns are available) as 100.

&quot;!.&apos;v The early bracketed figures are based on a* very Small number of returns and are relatively less trustworthy. *

The Table shows that whereas in 1916 consumption increased throughout (no doubt owing to the shortage of potatoes), in 1917, spite of an even greater shortage of potatoes and diminution of other food supplies, an upward tendency to March has been replaced by a downward tendency later.

Had consumption in 1917 continued from March on the same course as in 1916, it would now be nearly 10 per cent, above its actual level.

The foregoing figures, though the best available at the moment, are based on returns covering only a small proportion of the trade.

Arrangements are being made to obtain in future returns covering a much larger proportion of the consumption and dealing also with retail sales of flow.

Stocks.

In Table E particulars are given as to the estimated stocks of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs in the United&apos; I ingck&gt;ta at 1st June 1917, with comparative figures for a month before and a year before.,  -. .

Compared with a month before, the estimated stocks of wheat (including flour expressed as wheat) increased by 65,000 tons, or 6 per cent. Maize and rice also showed increases of 8,000 tons and 2,000 tons respectively. There were reductions, however, in other cereals, the stocks of barley. (excluding those in maltster&apos;s hands) showing a decrease of 7,000 tons, or 4 per cent. ; oats a decrease of 90,000 tons, or 23 per cent. ; beans, 3,000 tons, or 7 per cent., and peas, 3,000 tons, or 16 per cent.

There were also considerable reductions in the stocks of margarine, and of chilled and frozen mutton; but there were increases in butter, cheese, chilled and frozen beef, bacon, hams, and cocoa. The figures for coffee and tea showed little change.

Compared with 1st June 1916, there are reductions in wheat, including flour (256,000 tons, or 18  per cent), rice (12,000 tons, or 13 per cent.), maize (9,000 tons, or 5 per cent.\ margarine (3,200 tons, or 59 per cent.), and tea (4,200 tons, or 9J per cent.). The stocks of barley, however, are greater by 75,000 tons, or 76 per cent., even apart from those in maltsters&apos; hands (which amount to 222,000 tons, and are now available for food, instead of for brewing). There are also increases in butter (nearly.100 per cent.), peas, beans, coffee and cocoa.

For the chief cereals, somewhat later estimates are available, as follows :   Wheat. At 11th June the estimated stocks (including flour expressed as wheat) were 1,149,000 tons compared with 1,128,000 tons on the 1st June, and 1,428,000 tons at the corresponding date of 1916.

Barley. The estimated stocks (including those in maltsters&apos; hands) were 376,000 tons at 11th June, compared with 396,000 tons on the 1st June.

Oats. The stocks at 11th June are estimated at 250,000 tons, compared with 302,000 tons at 1st June.

Maize. The estimated stocks at 11th June were 146,000 tons, compared with 156,000 tons at 1st June,

Wholesale Prices.

The changes recorded in the latest . available wholesale prices of food and feeding-stuffs (Table D), as compared with the previous week, are mostly in a downward direction. The principal reductions are 16s. per cwt. in English mutton (the price of which had shown a continuous rise in the five preceding weeks, amounting in all to 57s. per cwt.), 14s. per cwt. in Danish bacon, Ds. Qd. per cwt, in Canadian bacon, 4s. 6d. per cwt. in Argentine chilled beef, 4s. per cwt..in New Zealand butter, and 2s. (yd. per cwt, in Irish butter. The only considerable increase in price was one of 6s. per cwt. in English beef.

As compared with a. month ago, the most noticeable features are decreases of 17s. Qd. per cwt. (or over lfd. per lb.) in Danish bacon, 14s. per cwt. in New Zealand butter,&apos; 9s. 6d. per cwt. in Canadian bacon, and 5s. per cwt. in Irish butter, and increases of 14s. 6d. per cwt. in English beef^. lis. 6d. per cwt. in English mutton, and 4s, A^d. to 6s. 7^d, per cwt. in sugar. There are also, minor increases in the prices of British barley, Argentine beef, and Irish bacon, and small reductions in Cheddar cheese, Canadian cheese, linseed cakeL cotton-seed cake, and country &quot; straight run &quot; flour.

The increases since the corresponding date in 1916, which affect every article included in the Table, except Argentine, mutton, are greatest in the case of pam&gt; kernel cake (163s. per ton, or 101 per cent.), British oats (22s. bd. per quarter of


5k

312 lbs., or 69 per cent.), l&amp;seed cake (163*. - p &amp; ton, or 63 per cent.), Calcutta linseed (228a. per ton, or 61 per cent.), and maize (28s. 6i. per quarter, or 61 per cent*), There are also increases exceeding 50 per cent, in the prices of British, wheat, rice, and Canadian cheese, of 40 to 41 per cent, in those of Ej^lish Cheddar cheese and London flour, of 34 to 39 per cent, in those of Canadian and Irish bacon, Egyptian cotton-seed, and palm-kernels, and of 25 to 28 per cent, in those of British barley, English mutton, and Irish butter. The sale price of tea at public auction was also considerably higher than at the same date in 1916, the average increase, even after allowing for the allocation of 40 per cent, of the supplies direct to buyers at Is. per lb., being about 4d. per lb., or roughly 30 per cent.

The increases are smallest in the case of Argentine beef (9 per cent.), Danish bacon (10 per centJ/New Zealand butted (14 per cent.), cube sugar (14 per cent.), English beef (.15 per cent.), and Danish butter (19. per Q&amp;nt.). The price..of Argentine muttos, the only article showing a decreases-is lower by 3s. per cwt., or 3 per cent.
