1. Great activity is being displayed at present in Maternity and Infant&apos;Welfare work by Local Authorities and Voluntary Agencies,

This worlc, which has been growing rapidly of recent years, is of particular value at the present tine and it should be developed to the fullest extent;    it has undoubtedly proved to be the means of saving many infants1 lives and of materially improving the health of the rising infant generation.

2. Hitherto the Wo&apos;tfk has been hampered by two things:-

(a) the fact that the Board of Education as well as the Local Government Board have had jurisdiction, which has led to much friction and overlapping;

(b) the fact that the powers of English Local Authorities, which are much narrower than those possessed by Local Authorities in Scotland and Ireland, have been too limited to enable them to provide or assist in providing certain important services*     For example, they are not able to provide or assist in providing

. creches, day nurseries, mi 11c depots for infants, nurses, &amp;c.

3. The difficulty with the Board of Education has been removed by Mr. Pisher agreeing with me that the whole of the work.should be supervised and aided by the Local Government Board.

The other difficulty can be removed by the passage of a very short Act conferring on English Local Authorities precisely the es#ie powers as those possessed by Local Authorities in Scotland and Ireland.

4. The only objection to the Bill that I have met is that of the Chairman of the National Health Insurance Commission who maintains that it trenches on the functions of the Commission.     This of course is not intended and I have given him an assurance that the Local Government Board would act in consultation with his Department in administering the Act.

Local Authorities and Voluntary Agencies have pressed me to pass such a Bill and I am confident that it would meet with approval from all sides,

5. A keen observer has said that the risk to life of an infant in England to-day is greater than that of a British soldier at the I&apos;ront,     I must point cut that the War Cabinet Trill &quot;be accepting a very grave responsibility if they permit ,a condition of things to continue which, in the judgment of those best able to form an opinion, involves the loos of 60,000 children every year whose lives could be saved by such measures as I wish to develop.

6. I therefore as?r. the permission of the War Cabinet

to introduce the accompanying Bill and to carry into effect ray agreement with Mr* Fisher at once*     In my opinion this step is of vital importance now.

Local Government Board. 14th June, 1917.
