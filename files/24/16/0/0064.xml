Chief of the Staff of (group omitted) tells me that drafts sent to the front from here had up till the other day been satisfactory, out half the last drafts from the Finland Regiment deserted en route for front and the Finland Regiment at front has notified that in view of this they do not want any more drafts from their depot battalion {here?}.

The 1st Machine Gun Regiment which is chiefly composed of BOLSHEVIKI have asked permission to send 1^0 deputies to front with greetings to Armies.     This is merely Bolshevik! propaganda, but they insist that as other organizations are allowed to send delegates permission cannot be with-held from them.     On the Northern front during FRATERNIZATION the Germans a short time ago gave &apos;Russians poisoned fCtJMA and on return to Russian line 1,000 men were admitted to hospital suffering from poisoning.     General/. Quartermaster tells me that this has been of the greatest assistance in helping to put an end to F^FUTKRhIZATION.
