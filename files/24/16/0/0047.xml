2* District Agricultural Cotmittees 

During the week a representative of the Board has attended meetings of the District Agricultural Committees for Sutherland, Caithness, Nairn, Elgin and Argyll in connection with the re-organisation work previously reported.   The Board were also represented at a meeting of the West Lothian farmers.   As before, the meetings have in all cases been satisfactory and there have been general expressions of willingness to produce the maximum amount of home-grown food next season.

The /


134

The  oheme of extended organieation is now being carried out by the Executive Committees and, to assist them in their duties, the Board have oirculated a supplementary list of instructions (copy attached).   It is proposed that eaoh Executive Committee with the aid of local representatives, should make a oomplete survey of the district under their oharge during the months of June and July.   In this way farmers will have timely warning of the minimum cultivation required of them.   In connection with this work of local enquiry the Board have drawn up a sohedule (oopy attached) for the use of Committees in making arrangements with farmers regarding cropping schemes for 1918.

3. Labour : Schoolboys.

The Board have issued a oircular to Committees inquiring as to (l) the utilisation of sohoolboy labour during the forthcoming corn harvest, (2) the probable demand for such labour, \Z) the nature of work available, and (4) the rates of remuneration likely to be offered.

4. Destruction of Agricultural Pests*

In oonneotion with the question of the destruction of wild birds, the Board have issued to Committees a leaflet on Birds, Insects and Crops (oopy attached) published by the Royal Sooiety for the Protection of Birds.

8. Orders Issued under the Defence of the Realm Regulation 2 R. Killing of Rabbits.

The Board propose to extend the soopo of their Order of 4th April last regarding the killing of rabbits by authorising the oooupier of any agricultural holding in Scotland to enter any woodland, moorland or heath adjoining such a holding between 1st July end 30th April following for the purpose of killing rabbits by means of trap or snare or net.   The Order so amended will be gazetted on the 15th ourrent,

6. Implements and Machinery. Binder Tw^ne.

In oonneotion with the arrangement between the Ministry of Munitions and manufacturers for the spinning of 18,000 tons of Binder Twine during the next twelve months, the Board have agreed, with the other two Departments of Agrioulture, to guarantee the makers against loss by taking over at cost price the stocks left in their hands after the harvest of 1918.

II.   Distribution of Foodstuffp.

8u,pply of Potatoes to Sootland.

The Army Canteen, Committee continue to consign potatoes to Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh but the supplies are diminishing in quantity.   It is anticipated that the distribution will be oompleted during this month.   The total quantity put on rail by the Army Canteen Committee to date amounts approximately to 4414 tons, distributed as follows:- Aberdeen 600 tons; Dundee 598 tonS; Glasgow 2122 tons; Edinburgh 1094 tons.

II. Othsr Matters relating to Agrioulture.

Ap-pointmsnt pf Technical Advisory Committee.

The Board recognising that their officers had little time for investigating soientifio developments affecting agricultural practice, have, with the consent of the threp Agricultural Colleges in Scotland, appointed a oommittee consisting of members of the staffs of the Colleges to advise them on such questions and to report what action is desirable in each case.

The Committee meet at intervals of two to three weeks and it is anticipated that their advico and assistance will be of oonsiderable benefit to the Board in dealing with questions arising out of the var conditions prevailing.

I am directed by the Board of Agriculture for Scotland to refer te their letter of 9th May and to express their gratification that the proposals therein submitted to you have been so readily accepted and aoted on.    While they consider the organisation outlined in the letter referred to should, eo far as possible, be followed, they leave the working out of details to the judgment of the Executive Committee, being satisfied that no effort will be spared to secure the very utmost cultivation during the next ploughing and seeding season. They enclose a memorandum which they trust may be useful to Committeee In the practical work which they will have to undertake*

BOARD OF  AGRICULTURE FOR SCOTLAND.

MEMORANDUM TO EXECUTIVE AGRICULTURAL COMMITTEES.

INCREASED CULTIVATION IN 1918.

The total increased cultivation desired from Scotland is not less than 350,000 acres in excess of tbe area under similar crops in 1916. The share of your county or district has been communicated to you, but it should be regarded as a minimum, and every effort should be made to exceed it.

In addition to ploughing up permanent pasture, the increased production of grain can and ought to be secured by ploughing an extra breadth of rotation grass land in addition to the ordinary lea break, and by taking a second crop of grain on much of the stubble land, as the acreage of roots must be diminished in 1918 if additional grain cannot otherwise be produced.

Increased acreage of potatoes can be got either by substitution of potatoes for turnips in the rotation, or by breaking up grass land in good time to ensure the proper working of the ground.

Executive Officers.

Each Executive Committee should appoint for such period as may be sanctioned an Executive Officer, and more than one if this is thought desirable and is approved by the Board. The Executive Officer should during June and July, with the assistance of members of the Committee, make a complete survey of his whole district, and note the possibilities of each farm.

Local Organisation.

To secure completeness of survey, it is necessary that each member of the Executive Committee should take special charge of a parish or other convenient area, getting one or more farmers or others resident in and representative of that area to act along with him. These local representatives would be of the greatest assistance to the Executive Officer.

Local Enquiry.

To secure the necessary information, it may, and probably will, be desirable, that a series of questions as to proposed cropping and other particulars should be addressed to each farmer. Where it can be arranged it will be well that the farms should be visited by a member of the Executive Committee and the Executive Officer, and the schedule of particulars if the Committee adopt this method of making enquiry filled up on the&apos; occasion of the visit.

When to Proceed.

The local enquiry should be completed by the end of,July, and farmers who do not satisfy the Committee that they will do their utmost should receive timely warning of the minimum that will be required of them. It will, in most instances, be prudent to obtain from the farmer a written promise to perform the work required.

Procedure where Compulsory Action is needed.

It is hoped that all interested in land, both landlords and tenants, will co-operate with the Committees and agree to the suggestions made, as equality of service, having regard to the circumstances of each case, is expected from all. Where Committees have reason to believe that their recommendations will not be carried out, or where there is

M &amp; G Ltd  Wt 1144/31  6-17  1000 0. 2


delay in commencing operations, they should submit full particulars of the case for the consideration of the Board.

On receipt of a recommendation from a Committee the Board may, if so advised, issue an order under the Defence of the Realm Regulations, by which the Board are empowered

(a) to require an occupier of land to plough certain areas, or to apply manures

as specified;

(b) to take over the areas in question with a view to their cultivation by an agent

acting for the Board;

(c) to authorise an occupier of land to cultivate such land in a manner not con-

sistent with his contract of tenancy ; or

(d) to determine the tenancy of land which is not being adequately cultivated. Before recommending the exercise of compulsory powers involving the Board&apos;s

taking over lands for cultivation, the Committees should have in view a scheme under which their recommendation can be carried out. The most convenient method adopted so far has been to appoint a neighbouring farmer, who has the necessary horses and implements, to carry out the cultivation for the Board. A sum is arranged in consultation between the farmer and the Committee (which the Committee will recommend the Board to approve), to be paid by the farmer for the right of cultivating, and his remuneration will be the profits derived from the sale of his crop in so far as they exceed the sum agreed upon. The interests of the proprietor {or occupier, if the subjects taken over were let) must of course be kept in view, and he will have in any event the right of applying to the Defence of the Realm (Losses) Commission, if he considers he has suffered loss or damage owing to the action of the Committee or the Board. The sum to be paid to the Board by the farmer cultivating should as a general rule be sufficient to cover the rent usually paid for the subjects entered upon, and also the amount of any claims for compensation likely to be established.

It is hoped that cases of compulsion will be few. The Board trust that the great majority of landowners and farmers will loyally accept the Committee&apos;s views, but the necessity for a greater supply of home-grown food is so urgent that private and personal considerations must, in all instances, give place to the public interest.

Crass Parks and other Pasture Land.

Committees may encounter difficulties in connection with the breaking up of grass parks. Every case brought under review will require to be dealt with on its merits, but the best solution will generally be found by inducing owners, who have not the necessary equipment to enable them to undertake the desired cultivation, to arrange for a short lease say for five or six years under which a tenant for an agreed-on rent takes over the land say from Martinmas next and cultivates it on lines approved by the Executive Committee.

Displacement of Stock.

It is scarcely to be expected that such an area of grass land as 350,000 acres can be ploughed without some disorganisation of farms and rearrangement of the methods of maintaining live stock, but it should be kept in mind that an increase in the arable area does hot necessarily imply a decrease in the numbers of stock. In any case, owing to the shortage -of shipping, an appreciable reduction must be made in the flocks and herds of the country in the near future in order to augment the diminished supplies of meat from abroad.

The Executive Committees should therefore regard the maintenance of live stock, with the exception of the dairy herds, as secondary to the production of cereals and potatoes.

Sir,

Session 1917-18: Schedule of Enquiry. I am directed by the Board of Agrioulture for Scotland to send herewith, for submission to your Committee, a number of copies of a schedule (P.P.3) whioh they have prepared for use, where desired, by Committees when making a survey of their districts In oonneotion with the arrangements for schemes of cropping in 1918.     The Board are aware that Committees in certain districts may not consider the sohedule altogether applicable to their local conditions, and that they may prefer to use a special form of enquiry, to which course the Board do not wish to offer any objection.    But it is generally desirable, for reasons both of uniformity and of economy, that the sohedule submitted should be used where possible, and I am accordingly desired to request that you will kindly inform the Board whether your Committee wish to have a supply of copies, and if so how many.    As soon as they have heard from you the Board will for-? ward the number, if any, whioh you will require.

BIRDS,  INSECTS, AND ! - &apos; -   f CROPS.

JT cannot be too widely known at the present time that * any general or indiscriminate destruction of Wild Birds would be fraught with grave danger to the Food of the People.

In every country and every district where Birds have been systematically destroyed, the result has been the same : {i) insect and vermin plagues, (2) serious losses to crops of all kinds, (3) failure of man to deal with the plagues, (4) efforts to bring back the Birds.

The greatest and most dangerous ENEMY of the Farmer and food-producer is the INSECT PEST. It has been stated jby Mr. Walter Collinge, M.Sc, F.E.S., that it is no unusual thing to find injury done by insects to the extent of 25 to 50 PER CENT. OF THE CROP; in other cases it is much beyond that. Thus the food-producer loses tens of thousands of pounds in money; the people lose tens of thousands of bounds of food.

Man himself cannot control Insect Pests. They increase jat a phenomenal rate. They are in many cases so small as 3&gt;.be hardly visible to man&apos;s eyes. They are hidden underground, and in buds, in fruit, in crannies and crevices of jlants, trees, wood, rubbish-heaps, etc. Poison, traps and nsecticides of various sorts have been tried, but all entail peavy. outlay in money, time, and labour which can ill be Lfforded at this crisis.

An example of the RATE OF INCREASE IN INSECTS afforded by the Green-fly (aphis). One fly to-day would mean, should all its descendants survive, 16,000 green-flies n a week&apos;s time. The Gipsy-moth, which in 1859 stripped phe trees of Brussels of their leaves, multiplies so quickly hat a single pair might in eight years, should all their progeny Ive, be responsible for the destruction of all the foliage in the United States.

The NATURAL ENEMY of the Insect is the INSECT-tEATING BIRD.


2

&quot; The millions of the Insect World are upon us,&quot; writes Dr. Hornaday (New York Zoological Society). &quot;The BIRDS FIGHT THEM FOR US.&quot;

&quot; Birds,&quot; says Dr. Gordon Hewitt (formerly of Manchester University, now Dominion Entomologist of Canada), &quot;are the MOST POWERFUL INSECTICIDES we have.&quot; Their rapid wings, keen eyes and ears, and sharp beaks are the weapons specially formed to deal with these plagues. &quot; The great hunter of insects, OUR GREAT AUXILIARY,&quot; saysM. Edmond Perrier (of the Institute of France), &quot;is THE BIRD.&quot;

For want of close examination the harm done by insects is too often attributed to the very Birds that are in pursuit of the insects. As Mr. Archibald, of Leeds University, says, the damage done by birds is readily detected; but it is vastly exaggerated through the mistakes of careless observers, &quot;whilst the great services they render are appreciated only by those who will examine and consider facts carefully.&quot; The Bird is extremely visible; the grub is hidden out of sight, the fly is small and harmless-looking. The Bird is six, eight, ten, or fourteen inches long ; the beetle is perhaps one-tenth of an inch.

A great proportion of the commoner small birds of the countryside live ENTIRELY OR CHIEFLY ON INSECTS. The amount they consume is prodigious, for a Bird will eat one-sixth of its own weight in a day. Beyond this comes the fact that even those species which as adults feed more or less on another diet, FEED THEIR YOUNG ON INSECTS  on grubs, worms, and flies. And at what time of the year is this ? In the spring and early summer, just when the destruction of injurious insects is most essential for the life and health of vegetation.

FOOD OF YOUNG BIRDS.

It is impossible to ignore the quantities of insect-food consumed by nestling birds. Young birds eat their own weight of food in 24 hours. A young robin (to quote a well-known computation) will eat 14 feet of worm in 12 hours, and be ready for more. A moment&apos;s consideration of the numbers of nests and young, and &quot;of the number of times a day, an hour, in which food is brought to the ever-hungry brood, may suggest the MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS OF INJURIOUS INSECTS so destroyed, but no conception can realise the gigantic total.

Professor Newstead states that on a low average a Starling visited its young with food 169 times in the 17 hours of its day (on certain days about 340 times) ; and the food in that time included 269 injurious insects to only four ben-ficial ones; among them were 14 slugs and snails. In 18 minutes 18 caterpillars of injurious moths and four wire-worms were brought. A Great Tit watched by the same observer made 384 visits in the day, and 90 per cent, of the food brought consisted of noxious larva?. &quot; If 20 days are occupied in rearing the young, that gives us a grand total of 7,680 visits to the nest, so that the single pair of birds would be responsible for the DESTRUCTION of between 8,000 and 9,000 INSECTS, chiefly caterpillars.&quot; The Redstart has been seen bringing caterpillars to its nest 23 times an hour, making, if even but one was brought each time, 2,254 in a week. The Flycatcher feeds its young with flies 500 times a day.

Nearly all the small birds of Great Britain are engaged in this work of destruction from March to August; and in a lesser degree all the year through. No one species but destroys some pest. On the other hand, no Bird lives wholly or principally on cultivated grain or fruit. Even the House-Sparrow, one of the few species which may be classified as injurious on account of its partiality for grain, eats many crane-flies (Tipula), small caterpillars, and wireworms, and feeds its nestlings mainly on harmful insects.

BIRDS VERSUS INSECTS.

As an indication of the injury done by Insects, a few representative instances may be cited.

The cost incurred to the country by Wireworm alone cannot be estimated. For three or even five years this grub is at work in the soil eating the roots of plants. It attacks practically all crops with the single exception of mustard, and feeds all the year round, save in the hardest weather. &quot; No substance that can be used on a large scale is known to kill wireworms in the soil&quot; (Theobald).

Click Beetles and their larva? the Wireworm are devoured by, among other species, Starling, Thrush, Blackbird, Skylark, Magpie, Finches, Chats, Robin, and especially by Lapwing, Rook, Jackdaw, Jay, Gull, and Meadow-Pipit. They are included in the food of many birds.

Cockchafer grubs also live and eat for three years below the surface, devouring grass and corn roots, turnips and

mangolds. The beetle itself eats the leaves of forest and fruit trees, and has even been known to feed ravenously on young apples.

The Cockchafer has determined enemies in the Shrike, Nightjar, Buntings, Starling, Kestrel, Tawny Owl; its grub in Jay, Magpie, Blackbird, House-Sparrow, etc.

Leather jackets, the grub of the Crane-fly (Daddy-longlegs), have ruined hundreds of acres of pasture-land (as in T894), so that the shepherds in large grazing districts have not known where to feed their sheep. They have been known to do over  70 worth of damage in a single field of oats in a season, and in other cases have destroyed acres of that crop. Experiments conducted in 1908 in the&apos; destruction of these grubs by poison and insecticides showed that they were remarkably difficult to kill, and, the Report stated (Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society), &quot;it is highly improbable that any substance will be found capable of destroying them in the ground without greatly injuring the grass.&quot;

Crane-flies and Leather jackets are accounted for in vast numbers by Lapwing, Rook, Starling, Thrushes, Corncrake, Wren, House-Sparrow, Yellowhammer, and Curlew. Professor Newstead records that during a plague of Crane-flies the remains of 400, with 1,600 eggs, were found in one of the pellets (representing probably one meal) of a Black-headed Gull. &quot; If this were so, a single Gull would be accountable for the enormous number of 4,000 crane-flies per day, making an aggregate of 28,000 per week.&quot; He estimated that at least 25 per cent, of the grubs were eaten by Rooks.

In 1881 losses in Great Britain through a plague of Turnip-fly were estimated by Miss Ormerod at half-a-million sterling, added to which was a heavy deficiency on late crops through re-sowing, and this again occasioned further loss and expense. It attacks plants of the cabbage tribe as well as turnips and swedes. The Turnip-Moth larva is another pest which destroys numerous food-plants, eating roots and tender young stems, and also seedlings. The Turnip Saw-fly is the adult stage of the well-known black &quot; Nigger &quot; grub. 1

The Turnip-fly has specific enemies in Skylark, Wagtails, various Finches and Warblers (including Blackcap); the Turnip-Moth in the Nightjar, its grub in the Lark; the Turnip Saw-fly in Lapwing, Partridge, Cuckoo, etc.

The Diamond-bached, Moth, a foreign invader, has appeared in such numbers as to occupy the keeper of a lighthouse in sweeping them off the lantern all night so that

the light might be visible at sea; and has ruined whole fields of turnips, swedes, rape, and cabbage. It has been com-batted experimentally (1914) with lime, sulphur, coke-fires, leaf-brushing, etc., but Starlings and Lapwings cleared an infested field in four days, after which the turnips grew vigorously. It is also taken by Gulls, Rooks, Chaffinches, Greenfinches, Linnets, etc.

The Magpie-Moth and Gooseberry Saw-fly are among the insects extremely destructive to gooseberry, currant, and apricot crops. The grubs are taken by the Cuckoo in particular. Flying Moths in general are captured mainly by Nightjar, Swift, Swallows, Starling, and Corncrake. The Corncrake is also one of the surest foes of the Antler-Moth, that devastator of grasslands, which has been known to strip mountain-sides brown and bare.

The Umber-Moth and Winter-Moth, two exceptionally mischievous species, are eaten by Great Tit (recorded by Mr. Collinge as taking about 100 an hour from an infested tree), Willow-Wren (120 found in one bird), and other Warblers, Jay, Jackdaw, and Starling.

There - are in Great Britain 530 species of Weevil, all of them destructive and all minute. They attack peas and beans (where their work is frequently attributed to sparrows), green crops, fruit-trees, hops, flowers in the garden and in greenhouses. The Raspberry Weevil is reported (1914) to have completely _ destroyed the blossom of an apple-orchard, besides eating buds, leaves, ends of twigs, and even bark, of currant bushes. The Apple-blossom Weevil has caused such incredible damage in France that syndicates of defence have been formed in some Departments to destroy it. Anthonomus rubi will ruin half a crop of strawberries in a few days, and 50 blossoms in a day. In one* season a fruitgrower in Kent lost  5   by the ravages of weevils. In 1903 a deputation from the National Fruit Growers&apos; Association asked the attention of the Board of Agriculture to the very serious losses occasioned to the industry by the ravages of blight, weevils, and other insects.

Weevils are more keenly sought for by Birds, says Professor Newstead, than any other group of insects. They have been found, for example, in the stomachs of the Starling (large numbers), Thrush (many), Blackbird, Hedge-Sparrow,  JVheatear, Stonechat, Whinchat, Tits, Whitethroat and other Warblers, Wagtails, Flycatcher, Chaffinch and other Finches, Yellowhammer, Skylark, Jay, Magpie, and Jackdaw. The Blue and Marsh Tits are, in particular, destroyers of Apple-blossom Weevil.

Of Aphis or Plant-Lice we have some 180 species. Nearly all plants, field and garden, suffer from these unpleasant pests, known also as Green-fly, Blight, and Smotherers. In 1882 the damage done in the hop-fields is said to have amounted to  1,750,000, with a cost in extra labour of  200,000 more. Aphides are eaten greedily by the Tit family, most of the Warblers, Goldfinch, Chaffinch, Lark, Wren, Hedge-Sparrow, House-Sparrow, and other Birds. The American Blight, or Woolly Aphis, in immense qtiantities by Blue Tit, and by Great Tit, Chaffinch, and Goldcrest.

Scale Insects are taken chiefly by Tits, Woodpeckers, Treecreeper, and Goldcrest.

Caterpillars and Larvce in general constitute the chief food of young birds, and are constantly eaten by Thrushes, Blackbirds (observed by Dr. W. T. Greene to take 600 in a day), Tits, Warblers, Finches, Wren, Robin, Nuthatch, etc.

Gnats and flying Insects of many kinds are eaten by the Swallow, Martins, Swift, Flycatchers, Wagtails, Warblers, and other birds. The Cattle-Fly, which causes an annual loss of millions sterling to the United Kingdom, is taken in particular by Wagtails and Jackdaw.

Eggs and Chrysalids of insects in great numbers are sought out by Hedge-Sparrow, Wren, Robin, and the Tits.

Snails, Slugs, and Worms are a staple food of Thrushes, Blackbird, Starling, Partridge, Corncrake, Magpie, Jay, Lapwing, Rook, Wheatear, and Robin. Of Slugs in particular the prime destroyers seem to be the Jackdaw, Plovers, Thrushes, Blackbird, and Starling. It has to be remembered, in cases of stomach exarnination, that soft animal food such as this is DIGESTED WITH GREAT RAPIDITY, and leaves few traces, whereas grain and seed remain in evidence for a very much longer time.

Tnis is necessarily a very cursory glance at the work done by Birds in checking Insect plagues.

BIRD PROTECTION IN THE INTEREST OF FARMERS.

The first movement towards INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION for Wild Birds was made by FARMERS AND FORESTERS on the Continent, because of alarming increase


in the ravages of insects. In 1895, consequent on a serious diminution of birds and corresponding increase of insects, the French Government invited all the other Governments of Europe to take part in a Conference on International Protection of Useful Birds. The Conference lasted ten days, and its members, representing nearly every European country, were unanimous as to the URGENT NECESSITY FOR BIRD PROTECTION IN THE INTERESTS OF AGRICULTURE. France, since the bad harvest of 1861, has been trying to undo the effects of indiscriminate destruction of small birds. Shortly before the outbreak of War the Minister of Agriculture gave instructions to all the professors of agriculture to teach the ABSOLUTE NECESSITY FOR PROTECTING BIRDS ; and the Agricultural Society of the Gironde issued a placard, &quot; THOSE WHO DESTROY THE LITTLE BIRDS ARE THE WORST ENEMIES OF AGRICULTURE.&quot;

In Canada and the United States of America gigantic losses from insect depredations have in recent years led to strong measures for the preservation of Birds. It is estimated that the birds of Nebraska eat 170 cartloads of insects a day, said Sir Boverton Redwood, speaking to the British Science Guild in 1914; that those of Massachusetts destroy 2r,ooo bushels daily, and that a single species of Hawk saves the farmers of the Western States T75,ooo dollars a year by destroying grasshoppers and field-mice. &quot; Yet millions of people engage in killing the birds that destroy injurious and disease-spreading insects ; and THE MORAL OF THESE FACTS APPLIES ALSO TO ENGLAND.&quot;

BIRD PROTECTION IN THE INTERESTS OF THE NATION.

Farmers, Market-Gardeners, and others should therefore ON NO ACCOUNT DESTROY SMALL BIRDS, or allow them to be destroyed, unless convinced, by thorough observation and examination, of the harm done to crops by such birds and that this harm is not outweighed by the good. Many a farmer and gardener, beginning as their resolute enemy, has been constrained to become a Bird-Protector by careful observation of their habits, and by finding in the stomachs of those shot instead of the grain and fruit anticipated remains of noxious insects that had been preying on the crops.


f

&quot; The farmer has only lately learned to appreciate the full value of Birds as insect destroyers. More exact knowledge of their food-habits has resulted in a HIGHER ESTIMATE OF THEIR UTILITY on the farm and demonstrated more clearly than ever the NECESSITY OF ACTIVE MEASURES TO INSURE THEIR PROTECTION&quot; (T. S. Palmer, Biological Survey, U.S. Department of Agriculture).

All experience shows that the preservation and protection of INSECT-EATING BIRDS is not only essential in the interests of the Grower, but is of VITAL IMPORTANCE IN THE INTERESTS OF FOOD-PRODUCTION in Great Britain.
