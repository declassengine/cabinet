WAR CABINET*

Petrograd,

15th June.

Prom Lieutenant-Colonel Blair. To B.M.I. 1168.

Brigadier-General Knox reports as follows:-

From H.Q&apos;s. South-West front dated June 5th.

158th Division has been renamed 22nd Siberian Division, 152nd Division has been renamed 6th Gesnadier Division, the 161st is now 5th Transamur and 163rd is the 19th Siberian, new divisions have only one battery eaoh which is a 7th Battery in one of the old artillery brigades.

There are 2298 field guns (330?) 6 (sic) 45 line and 48 line howitzers and 478 heavier howitzers and guns on front. Most of them are in the 11th and 7th Armies.   The 11th has done little to prepare for offensive.   Its Inspector of Artillery is to be changed.     The 7th Army had done more and its spirit is better.    It has concentrated on a striking front of 20 kilometres 288 field guns 72 light howitzers and 224 heavier guns and howitzers.

Shell is sufficient.   There is a considerable reserve of rifles and each battalion will soon have 5 to 6 machine guns.

Each rifle has 255 rounds and each machine gun 9,000 but the reserve only amounts to 66 (million ?) Russian 20,000,000 Japanese and 60,000,000 Austrian.

To-morrow Brusilov leaves to suoceed Alexieff and the officers here regret his departure as he has consistently given way since the revolution to the wildest demands of the men. He has will and oommonsense but it is feared he will continue his political gymnastics at the Stavka.    There is some doubt as to whether he will agree with Danikin, his new Chief of Staff.

He Is succeed (1 group omitted) the south west front by Outer who has only been in commend of 11th Army since March and has done nothing while there.     Biukhonin becomes Chief of Staff.     Erdoli has been suggested by Brusilov as commander of 11th Army.     There can only be one opinion on all these changes on the eve of an offensive.

I asked the new Chief of Staff to-day what measures of success he hoped for if the men attacked.   He acknowledged our superiority in men and guns but did not think that we would reach Lemberg.

When last year offensive commenced active units were up to establishment and there were 200,000 drafts in immediate rear. Aotive units are now 800,000 under establishment and there are only 60,000 half trained and undisciplined drafts in rear. Condition of horses is very bad.     He thought the offensive would cause the enemy to detach from other theatres and would remind him that the Russian Army had still to be reckoned with.
