MEMORANDUM.

In the course of the past few weeks a number of applications for assistance in obtaining supplies of light beer (that is beer containing not more than Z!jl of proof spirit) have been received from controlled employers who have obtained licences for the sale of light beer in their works under the Board&apos;s certificate.

It appears that brewers who manufacture this beer have now communicated with their customers and have informed them that they are unable to supply any more of the light beer at present, on the ground that the Government have required that the light beer should be included in thoir total output with their other beer and they are consequently unable to supply any more of it unless &amp; certificate can be granted for the beer to be brewed in addition to the standard barrelage for the breweries in quostion*

In all these &apos;works, the men employed are required to work under great heat or oonditions of oxc pt;.onal stress and the employers foresee a considerable reduction in their output unless the oupplieo of beer arc mfiiijtriinoc..     Men who formerly brought beer into the YJorke with than tie now no longer able to obtain it and the position is mp.ee more diffiuv.lt. by the failure Of supp.&apos;!.:&gt; cs of vur^ouc u&apos;:;hcr drinks in the making of v/hich it is necessary to use sugar.

i.&apos;ith the advance of the summer and the increasing effect of the Food Cc.rIre?ler1 s restrictions on the output cf beer, there seems to be every probability that the demand for the enpply of light beer  p munition works will inoreese.   The matter has been oarofully conFlc.ered by the Ganteeu. Ccmmj J:i ee for sore time pact and again at thc&gt;.Jr meeting on the 5th irstast, and itdecided to submit tho matter for the oonsiceratioij. of the Board will a recommendation that steps should be t.?ken to obtain authority fcr breweries tc brew 2&gt;* beer for supply to munition workers in excess of tho prescribed barrelage for their brewery.

In addition representations have been received from the Port of Bristol Authority with regard to the supply of light beer in their Canteens at Avonmouth and Portishead Bocks and the necessity for meeting the requirements of transport workers not merely at Bristol but at other Books throughout the oountry was referred to in strong term3 at a meeting of the National Transport Workers1 Federation held at Bristol on the 14th Instant, at which a member of the Board was present.

Attention has &quot;been oalled in the press to the difficulty experienced by fanners in obtaining labour for hay-making if they are not in a position to promise the usual allowance of beer.   It is understood also that the deprivation of their usual beverage is giving rise to dissatisfaction among the miners and iron workers.

On the whole there is a body of evidence tending to show that the working classes resent keenly and are suffering under the Food Controller&apos;s restrictions on the supply of beer at a season when the need for it is most severely felt.

The question in what way it may be possible to increase the supply of beer available for consumption by the workers with the minimum sacrifice of food-stuffs has received the anxious consideration of the Board.   The experience gained by the Board of the sale of light beer (i.e. beer containing not more than 2% of proof spirit) in its own public-houses and in Canteens leads them to believe that light beer, although it does not compete with beers of the ordinary strength when such beers can be readily obtained, can command a good sale when ordinary beer is not available.   It satisfies the craving for the taste of beer and supplies a physiological need to which strenuous manual work necessarily gives rise.

The Board,  therefore recommend that beer containing not more than 2% of proof spirit be excluded from the restrictions on barrela.ge.   Any brewer who elected to brew such beer would thus be able to do so without injury to his trade in ordinary beer, and the demand for beer in excess of the restricted barrelage would be met to some extent by the supply of a lighter beer than that usually drunk in this country, and involving in its manufacture a smaller consumption of food stuffs.
