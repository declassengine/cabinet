(Minute and Memorandum &quot;by f&gt;ir Alfred Mond).

7th June, 1917

I5y dear Prime Minister,

I submitted to you a Memorandum on the 24th May (A?PEHDIS) suggesting that the Committee of Accomodation should he given Cabinet authority to decide all matters of accommodation,     It has &quot;become increasingly important that some decision on this natter should he taken,*     The members of the Committee strongly insist that their present powers are insufficient to enable them to carry put the vorlc promptly and decisively m it should be done  &gt;     I, personally 9 agree very strongly with this view*     It is quite impossible to do the work with that rapidity and decisiveness which the war&apos;demands, if, as at present* I have to he continually in the position of negotiating with other Departments over practically every step that has to he taken, and for every change that is required to he made*     I respectfully submit that it is not a position in which a responsible Minister ought to be placed0        *a former times, the Cabinet dealt wi.th these questions, and, either the Cabinet should deal with thoitj again, or delegate authoritative pov/ers to me or the Committee to act for the Cabinet with a decision that will be treated as final*

Yours sincere?-:/,

APPENDIX,

AO CO M X 0 3) A 1 I Q U.

Memorandum from the First Commissioner of Works*

The question of accommodation, the rival claims of various Departments and the necessity for interfering with established practice etc., is causing increased difficulties.

Soon after I took Office, I submitted a scheme for appointing the Accommodation Committee constituted as follows:-

The First Commissioner of Works (Chairman)

Dr. Macn&amp;mara.

Mr. Forster.

Mr. Kellaway.

with Sir Arthur Darrant as Secretary*

You were pleased to approve of this scheme. The Committee has been meeting weekly and has done extremely valuable work*     It suffers, however, from the defoct of not being possessed of .that power of authority to enable it to compel speedy acquiescence with its decision as it could if it had Cabinet authority.     This defect has necessitated, for instance, the question of dealing with the accommodation for the new Department of Admiral Geddes Tshicfo involves the   accommodation of the Board of Education, etc. being deputed by you to the Postmaster-General for decision. This was dealt with this morning in a satisfactory manner because he,having full authority to decide,the usual departmental objections and delays have, I hope, been overcome. But in reality it is unnecessary to trouble so busy a Minister as the Postmaster-General or any other Minister in these matters.

I would suggest that the Committee of Accommodation should be given Cabinet authority to &apos;decide all these matters and if you think it advisable to strengthen the Committee by adding another Minister I would suggest that the Paymaster-General or the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster be added, or if the Cabinet will give me tho authority to decide these matters I em perfectly prepared to take it. The question is somewhat urgent as there are difficult matters of accommodation pending between such two important Departments as the Foreign Office and Colonial Office for. solution* I .1 do not see that at present there exists any authority e-xcept\tte War Cabinet which is in a position to give a decision on \ these questions of accommodation.   They are naturally of on. j intricate and detailed character, and require a good deal of time and study and I think yq;tf tfill agree v/ith me that the War Cabinet which is engage2?so much more important work1   should not be troubled with these matters.
