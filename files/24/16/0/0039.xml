Memorandum on Possible Austrian Developments. (14th June, 1917.)

Tine following information has been received from a usually reliable source:*

The Austrian Speech from the Throne.     There are three points in Emptfrur Charles&apos; speech from the Throne which seem to indicate the direction of Count Clam-Martinitz  Administration* s future policy.

1. The Emperor&apos;s announcement that he would take the oath Of the Constitution at a later period seems to foreshadow some radical changes of the Constitutional.

2. The statement that the new basis of Austrian Constitutional life shall be &quot;the unity of the Empire&quot; and

13.     The lack of any definite statement as to the conditions of peace.

Allusions in the Vienna Press and private information v  reaching the writer from Austria-Hungary make it clear that the proposed changes of the Austrian Constitution will be inspired by the principle of centralising the Administration. Count Tisza being no longer in a position to object to tho autonomy of Galicia the Vienna Reichsrat will be reconstructod,so as to lose by

theelimination of the Poles some 70 of its Slav members. As regards the other provinoes the writer has reason for believing

that their political reconstruction will be guided by principles Which are remote from being broad-minded ones.     A project is being worked out at present, r/hich is based upon the idea that the powers of the provincial diets (Landta-ge) should be curtailed so as to leave them the legislative power, whilst the executive power (which so far, has been their strength) should be transferred to the central Administration in Vienna.

The Austrian Government are of Opinion that by thus curtailing the privileges of the local Parliaments they will eliminate national strifes which as a rule originated in the Diets.     This, however, is a fallacy.     The loss of the executive power will certainly reduce the possibilities of internal strife within the provinces, but it will merely transfer the whole trouble to the Reichsrat in Vienna which thereby will be deprived of every chance of despatching its Imperial business.     On the other hand it is not quite clear how the Central Administration in Vienna v/ill be enabled to settle national grievances in a just and fair way without being advised by the representative body of the Landtag.       Thoso difficulties and grievances arc mostly oaused by questions of language.     The executive power of the local &amp;mdta% enabled this body in many cases to settle the matter there; if deprived of this privilege the diet will have to refer to Vienna.     What wi!3 be the guiding principle there?    The logical way of reasoning seems to point to one possibility, viz: the choice of a single language as the Constitutional official language of the Empire and the relegation of all the others to the rank of means of private intercourse, and as educational language in strictly circumscribed districts.

Thus the &quot;unity of laapire&quot; seems explained.     Whether the same system v/ill prevail with regard to the reforms promised to Bohemia will largely depend upon the final fsolution of the war.

There seems to he a tendency to grant the Czechs, as a concession, the division into German and Czech districts of Bohemia with fully German administration in the one and an exclusively Czeoh one in the other; but this compromise is as firmly rejected by the Czechs as by the Germans.     The unanimously expressed desire of the Czech people: restitution of the Bohemian Kingdom and its merely personal union with Austria -a politioal formation similar to that of Hungary, will only be realised in case of a defeat of Austria.     The third point is of interest because it proves the subservience of Austrian statesmen to the German point of view that official statements as to annexation or non-annexation should be avoided as much as   possible and, if unavoidable, only be made after previous agreement.     It is for this reason that the Austro-Hungarian Governments have now allowed the press to discuss the conditions Of peace.     The uniformity of the articles which, so far, have been published indicates the official sources which are common to all of them.     According to those more or less vague allusions the Vienna Foreign Office seems to contemplate the peace-conditions - so far as Austria-Hungary is concerned -upon the following lines:

Restitution of the status quo ante bellum   (in a territorial

sense)  

The occupation by Austria-Hungary of the Lovcen mountain.

The freedom of the Danube (meaning the Danube Commission to be disbanded and the Danube to be declared a free river from its source to its estuary).

Serbia to be united with Montenegro.

Oustoms-Union between Austria-Hungary - Rumania - Serbia and Bulgaria.     (This idea is most likely prompted by the consideration of the Middle-Europe scheme.     It will most certainly be s&amp;roagly opposed by the Agrarian interests in Austria as v/eli as in Hungary and, as the Agrarians are most likely to wield power in the near future,there is very little chance of this idea being taken seriously.)
