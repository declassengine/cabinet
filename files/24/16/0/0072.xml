WEEKLY REPORT ON ITALY. Ill June 16, 1917. International Affaire

Both in its external and its internal bearings the recent proclamation at Argyrnoostro of Albanian independence tinder the protection of Italy is an event of considerable interest and importance*

In its international aspeot it is in the first plaoe and on the surfaoe a counterbdd to the Austrian proclamation of Albanian autonomy made in January of this year on the anniversary of the Austrian advance on Buraszo.     In this document Serbia was represented as the enemy from whom  Ibanians had most to fear and self-government was made conditional on the good behaviour of the Albanians under Austrian military government.    The two proclamations taken together bring to an issue the long-standing rivalry between Austria-Hungary and her former &apos;ally* in Albania, where Italy ohampioned the principle of Albanian independence in opposition to Austria&apos;s eoonomlc and strategic encroachment.

Although,when the proclamation was first announced in Italy on June 5th, it was generally assumed that it had been made on the strength of a previous accord with the Allies of Italy; it seems clear that this was not so.    The step taken by Italy seems therefore to have the general oharaoter in regard to ths Entente of an assertion of Italy&apos;s (and her Foreign Ministers) dignity and standing as a member of the Entente and in particular of her special interest and determination to exercise influence in Balkan

questions.

A special pointing is given to this latter aspect by the? dating of the proclamation from Argyrpoastro* a city o  tiifr$h6rn Epirus and this pointing Is further emphasised by the occupation of Jannlna, a city which lies well within the limits assigned to Greek Epirus by the Conference of London and the subsequent protocol of Florence.    !Ehe semi-official note, which accompanied the announcement on June 10th of the occupation, represented the step as a &quot;military necessity&quot;, and as intended to strengthen not only Italy&apos;s position in S. Albania but also that of the Allies in general in Macedonia (by creating na safe base for a line of communication across the Adriatic&quot; shorter and less ex-posed to submarine attack than that is the Aegean) and went on to describe Italy&apos;s action as having &quot;something of the character of the similar operations carried out by the French and British forces on Greek territory, being intended, like these, to free the military action of the Allies from political complications arising from the antagonism between the Government of Ting Con stantine and that of M. Veniaelos.and here it is easy to read between the lines a reforenoe to the occupation of Thessaly and to the triumph of Frenoh ideas represented by the recent new departure in the Greek policy of the Entente.    There is no doubt too a reference to the establishment by the French of a&apos;Republican Government at Coritza in&apos;December of last year (only announced in Hay of this year).    The proclamation thus token in connection with the oooupation of Jannlna must be regarded aeK in its southward orientation, an attempt to re-establish a balance between French and Italian influence in Greece

In reply to fears expressed lest the extension of activity

involved in the Proclamation might endanger Italy&apos;s primarily strategic occupation of Valona, it is subtly argued that, in&apos; dating the proclamation from Argyrocastro, the Italian Government intended to draw a distinction between Valona and Albania. It is also suggested - on the assumption that there was no previous accord with the /Hies - that the new departure might compromise Italy&apos;s claims to portions of the Adrlatlo coast more essential to her than Albania.     Uith regard to the question of accord with the Allies, the Sonninian organ &quot;II Giornale dfItalia,&quot; states that &quot;the action of Italy has been reoognised loyally and without restrictions by all the Entente Governments&quot;;   but no official information has been published on this point.    However, if the Italian Government can be trusted to interpret the ambiguous, word &apos;protection&apos; (employed in the Proclamation) in the sense in which it is obviously intended that it should be accepted by Albanians -of temporary and friendly tutelage with full respect for the principle of national rights - rv.ther than in that of a &quot;colonial&quot; protectorate, there would be seem to be no conflict between Italy action and the principles of Entente policy or the aims of the Entente in the Balkans. !,

The remarkable change of tone in regard to &quot;Venizelism&quot; noticeable during the last few days in the tone of the more imperial istio Italian journals seems to indicate that their editors have received information of completely satisfying assurances given to Italy in regard to the role assigned to her in Asia Hinor and probably also in the Balkans.     The, until yesterday, violently anti-Venizelist &quot;Idea Eaaionale&quot; says (on the 13th) in so many words that &quot;the r&gt;roolamation of Albanian independence, the occupation of Jannina, and the guarantees to Italy with regard to Asia Minor,        especially the future possession of Smyrna, to which P, Teniaelos aspired, permit Italian Nationalists to

regard the actual solution of the Greek question r/ith indifference*11 Whether a compromise has been effected betv/een Italian and 7enissellet ambitions vith regard to iipirus v/e do not yet know. Internal Politics.

It t/as at firet assumed that the proclamation of Albanian

independence represented a dedlsion of the Y/hole Cabinet* A

Cabinet Council v/hich had been called for June 6th ( the day on

r/hich the nev/s of the Proclamation was -published) r/as put off by

Signor Boeelli at the last moment by telegraph.     It became knor/n

that tne postponment r/as due to serious diseu&amp;eions v. ithin the

Kin&apos; i^ry, that Baron Sonnino had not consulted his colleagues of

the extreme Left - SignoriBiesolati and Bojiomi (Reformist Socialists)

and Comendini (Republican) - before ordering the proclamation, and

that these Ministers had, by way of protest, refused to be present

at the meeting of the Cabinet.     The democratic press thereupon

raised a violent protest against the autocratic methods of the

Kinieter for foreign Affaire, criticising severely not the substance

but the aaaaner of the proclamation (&quot;It t?as not the independence

of Albania but the independence of Sonnino. that was in question&quot;)

and laying great stress on the importance of complete accord r/ith

the Allies and avoidance of anything savouring of Imperialism.

ilo trustworthy information is at hand as to the details of

the Ministerial crisis r/hich appears to have been complicated by

a

questions of internal joolicy, but at subsequent meeting^ of the

Cabinet (from v/hich the three Ministers named were absent) and at

consultations betveen Signer BOBelli and individual Uinisters a

solution - satisfactory for the time being at least * eeems to have

been reached.     ITo more radical change is predicted than the

creation of an inn^r l/ar Cabinet, consisting probably of the

president of the Council, the Minister  of War and Marine and * &apos;

*\

Si^nor Bissolati, and changes in the holders of subordinate offices.


There seems to be no question of Signor Boselli being replaced.

As a consequence of the Cabinet crisis the re-opening of Parliament has been postponed from June 14th to June 20th.
