&apos;The Governor of New Zealand to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

(Received Colonial Office 11.55 l|lth June,- 1917.)

The time has arrived in the opinion of the Government of New Zealand when it is necessary to indicate to His Majesty&apos;s Government that the future disposition of German Territory in the Pacific is a question of gravest concern* German Samoa has been occupied and is now held by New Zealand troops. Australian troops occupy other German lands In the pacific My Government feel respectfully that they cannot consent to the restoration to Germany of these lands.     To do so would be to establish a constant menace to peace and &amp;-&quot;&amp;&gt;1e in the Pacific which would demand unnecessary sacrifices irom our people in the futuret   nor can we British people in New Zealand abandon the native population of Samoa for they are intimately associated with our maori brothers by descent and language.

The members of the New Zealand Parliament are elected by universal suffrage:    during the war party politics have been abandoned and this Government&apos;s decision therefore represents he will of a democratic people who earnestly desire peace but on terms which will protect their future freedom. New Zealand is confident that her position will be understood (?) and her wishes respected by the Imperial Government and the Alliesi

The Governor of New Zealand to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

(Received, Colonial Office 2-50 p0m. 13th June, 1917)

With refcrense to my telegram 12th Juno with regard to German Colonies my Ministers are anxious that gist should &quot;be embodied in the speech at the opening of Parliament on tho 28th of June.     They have asked me however to consult you before doing so in case you saw any objection to such a course.     They think at the same time that it would have a good effect in the Dominion as practically all classes are strongly opposed to Socialist and pacifist propaganda which has lately appeared in the Press at home and abroade Should be glad to receive early reply by telegraph.
