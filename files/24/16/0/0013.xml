WEEKLY REPORT&apos;ON RUSSIA. VIII. June 11, 1917.

Position of the Coalition Government.

The Coalition Government is passing through a period $f acute crisis, and the task of the Socialist Ministers is one of extreme difficulty.    At the present moment the disruptive tendencies among the extreme doctrinaire Socialists are very active. Such incidents as the Kronstadt declaration of independence indicate the dangers that threaten the Government from the Extreme Left. The Kronstadt incident has been cleared up by the submission of the local Labour Committee to the Provisional Government on condition that the Government removes its representatives at Kronstadt.   On this condition the Kronstadt Committee has agreed to recognise the full governmental powers of the Provisional Government over the whole of revolutionary Russia.

Separatist tendencies on the part of the Extreme Socialists, however, are not likely to prove any very real danger to the Government.   The Social Democrats as a whole are strongly centralist and will do everything possible to prevent Russia from being divided up into a number of independent revolutionary units. They realise that such independent units would not be strong enough to oppose a counter-revolutionary movement, which sooner or later would be the inevitable outcome of a weak Government in Petrograd. It may be noticed that the Kronstadt movement was not only opposed by the more Moderate Socialists in the Government, but even by the stronger internationalists such as Mr Chkheidze, who refused to join the Government when the Coalition was formed..

Dangers of a Counter-Revolution.

The dangers of a counter-revolution are the daily theme of the Socialist press, and are very far from &quot;being imaginary. The extreme doctrines preached by the Socialists in Petrograd have undoubtedly turned large numbers of people against the whole revolutionary movement, and it is not unlikely that an attempt may be made to overthrow their supremacy.   Any such movement on a large scale would probably come from the South where Socialism is far less developed than in Petrograd and Moscow. The Socialists in Petrograd are already looking anxiously towards the Ukraine, where they scent danger In the future.

Since the Revolution there has been a strong separatist movement in the Ukraine, and the Ukrainian Nationalists have been demanding a separate army.   This demand has met with strong opposition both from the Kiev and the Petrograd Councils of Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Delegates.   They see in it a menace to Socialism, as the formation of a national army would greatly strengthen the chauvinistic elements in the Ukraine and might be used by the Russian counter-revolutionaries in order to organise a movement againoi Petrograd.     The Kievska&amp;a Mysi, a Moderate Socialist paper in Kiev, reminds its readers of what took place in the Caucasus, where the Georgian Federalists, forming themselves into special detachments, became very chauvinistic and co-operated with Tsardom against the Armenians.    In view of the fears end suspicions of the Socialists it is not surprising that the proposal to form separate Ukrainian regiments was defeated by 264 votes to 4 at a meeting of the Kiev C.W.S.D.

A stronger note of warning against the nationalist movement in the Ukraine is struck by the R^bojjhja^raj^^eta of May 17, the

organ of the Minimalists (Social Democrats) in Petrograd:-

&quot;Alarming news comes from the Ukraine.   Judging by the reports of the Commissioners of the Executive Committee of the C.W.S.D.   the national and federalist tendencies there are very strong, tendencies which aim at separation from Russia and the calling of an independent Constituent Assembly for the Ukraine and New Russia.

&quot;We ourselves bring forward the principle of the self-determination of the peoples inhabiting Russia, and we demand very wide self-government and even provincial autonomy.   But the federalist movement in the Ukraine is evidently taking the character of national exclusiveness.   The motto &apos;The Ukraine for the Ukrainians&apos; puts a weapon into the hands of all chauvinists, anti-Semitos and even conscious counter-revolutionaries. Round the motto of &apos;The separation of the Ukraine&apos; are grouped the Radical wing of the Ukrainian Nationalists and also many of Stolypin&apos;s old supporters who hope to use this as a lever for a counter-revolutionary campaign.   The preaching of anti-Semitism in the country is taking acute forms, and at the same time among the peasants and the petit bourgeois a campaign is being oarried on against the C.W.S.D., as being organs which have been forced upon the Ukraine by the Russian Revolution, but with which hitherto the Ukraine has had nothing to do&quot;.

This Petrograd Socialist paper further alludes to the fact that in the Ukraine industry is very little developed and the numbers of the proletariat are small, that public life was suppressed by the old regime, and the peasantry being undeveloped politically can be used for the purpose of stirring up national passions,

It is clear both from this article and from the opposition to the formation of separate Ukrainian regiments that the

International Socialists in Petrograd are greatly disturbed by fears of the Russian Nationalists in the South stirring up national feeling amongst the Ukrainians.   The chief supporters of the Socialists in the South would be found amongst the Jews, and it would not be difficult to set the Ukrainians against the Jews,   There is much more anti-Semitism among the Ukrainians than among the Great Russians who only come into contact with the Jewish Intelligentsia, and it will not help the cause of the Socialists in the South to be associated with the Jews.

The Attitude of the Cossacks 

Another difficulty the Petrograd Socialists have to face is the threatening attitude of the Cossacks.   At the time of the Revolution the Cossacks refused to support the police, but they are not pleased with the turn of events since then.   The Cossacks have no sympathy with the doctrines of Internationalism and are now anxious, it appears, to cast themselves adrift from the Government of Petrograd.   They desire to form themselves into an independent army and to set up a number of small States in the S.E, of Russia,   The danger to the Central Government is obvious and the official organ of the C.W.S.D. has hastened to point out that the Cossack units might be used &quot;for the suppression of internal popular agitation in Russia&quot;, i.e, for an anti-Socialist counter-revolutionary movement.

Whatever may be the strength of these independent movements in the South of Russia, it may be taken for granted that in his recent visit to Kiev, Kishinev and Odessa Mr Kerenski realised the danger to the Central Government at Petrograd. His passionate appeals to the army to unite and return to their discipline may be largely due to the fact that he realises that a strong army is the only support against a counter-revolution.

If these separatist tendencies develop in the South of Russia it may very well he that the Socialists in Petrograd will cease talking about principles and will join Mr Kerenski in his efforts to create a strong army.

Allied Socialists in Russia.

During the last week the main subject of interest in Petrograd has been the Stockholm Conference and the attitude of the Allied Socialists towards it.   Mr Henderson, M  Thomas and M. Vandervelde have now made it clear that before an International Conference can be called the Allied Socialists must firct come together and draw up conditions upon which a plenary congress could meet.   For this purpose they have proposed the- summoning of a Socialist Conference in London during the month of July.

It is not uninteresting to notice the comments of a Socialist paper, the Rabochaya Gazeta, on the recent visit of Messrs Thorne, O&apos;Grady and Sanders and MM. Moutet and Cachin to the Russian front.   The writer criticises the delegates of both countries, but pioks out the two French Socialists as showing more understanding of Russian aims than the British Socialists.   About the latter he says:-

In the speeches of the Englishmen there was clearly heard the note that only the military destruction of Germany can free the world from militarism, that the Germans are the bulwark of absolutism which can only be destroyed by war.   Only one of them, Sanders, slowly but noticeably, separated himself from the Imperialist tendency and began to speak of the International&quot;.

Propaganda at the Front.

To counteract the effect of the pacifist agitation at the front (referred to in my last report) a number of papers for soldiers have been started.   These papers are written in very simple language and are specially adapted for the peasant soldiers.   They explain the differences between the old and new discipline, the meaning of the Soldiers1 Committees etc. They also explain the Land Question and report peasant meetings from different parts of the oountry urging that the land should become the property of the people, but that it should not be seized forcibly.   They report that the peasants generally are urging the soldiers at the front to offer a stubborn resistance so long as the war lasts,
