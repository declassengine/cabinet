AJH BOARD,.

Report to tho Cabinet, A,3.153/19 9th Jvme&gt; lgi?t 15

General 1. The Board have had under consideration tho

xolicy. possibility of providing, for tho campaign of 1918,

a considerable force of long distance bombing

maohinos.

The output of aoro-onginos shoiild, under the arrangements which have been made, attain towards; the end of this year tho relatively High figure of some 8,500 a month.   This includes a certain number of engines expected to be obtained from France and from America, as regards which some measure of uncertainty is inevitable, but as regards the British portion (roughly 1,800) of the above output, there is no reason why it should not be continued indefinitely and oven somevrhat increased*

Compliance with the programme put forward by the Expeditionary Fcroe   which was set forth in the las* weekly report to the Cabinet,Involves at present the necessity for both maintenance and expansion of the Air Forces on the Western Front.   Although Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s programme cannot be considered as absolutely final, there is ground for hoping that when it is attained,as it should be towards the end of this year, the need for expansion will be very substantially reduced, and tha^ tho output in view will provide a margin available for other purposes.

In these circumstances,should no unforeseen developments occur, there is every reason for thinking that it may be possible to provide,in tho early months of nex* year, a substantial force of aircraft for employment on bombing expeditions, against enemy objectives, independent of the air squadrons attached to the British Expeditionary Force*   The question of the possibility of providing the neoessary personnel is engaging the attention of the Director General of Military Aeronautios.

In anticipation that the above projeot will be realised, questions arise as to the organisation, command and composition of this force, the basis from which it should operate, and the objectives against which it should be directed.

The Board are considering the precise design of machine which should be constructed for the purpose, and a specification of the requirements which it will have to satisfy has already been laid down.   In this connection it


may b&amp; of interest to record that one of the German machines employed in tho recent iraid on the Modv/ay srhich fell into the Thrones, has bqon recovered.

2. The Board have had boforo thorn a state-

ment of tho seaplane requirements of tho Royal Naval Air Service for the yoar 1918*   Thoso v/ill involve tho construet.ionw.of ,a considerably in-croasod number of largo flying boats and an output from this country of 20 ^ month is desired* Additional manufacturing facilities for thoso large craft, which nood specially lofty buildings, will have to to established and arrangement8 to this end arc in progress*

3# Tho Committee appointed by tho First

Commissioner of Works to report on tho use mado by the several departments of tho accommodation provided for them, reported extremely favourably on the arrangements adopted in the Air Bo.ird Office* T hoy say that -

&quot;The spirit of energy pervading those vast promisos and tho atmosphere of seriousness and determination permeating the ranks of the huge staff housed v;ithin, stand out vith startling prominence&quot;*

&quot;Certainly tho system adopted for the allocation of office accommodation to the various sections and branches for the execution of work varying so greatly in character and making such hoavy demands upon tho spaco availablo, has contributed to tho success of thoso ossential and vital factors, control and supervision, to a very remarkable degroe and reflects tho highest crodit upon thoso responsible&quot;*

* * *

&quot;Theso thoroughly well-organised and supervised departments, have in fact a gross averago provision per person slightly unfetf that laid down by your In:; vjeturs as f-iir and reasonable for ordinary office purposes&quot;. 1

Supply 4* The deliveries of engines and aeroplanes

have been as follows:-&apos;

l^ftll                                                     Endings Aeroplanes

Total for tho week to the 2nd June ilS 197 * Total for the month of May and

Juno 1st ctflu 2nd                            853 1202

Total for April 1917                         675 804

Total for Anril 1916                          &apos;20  202


16

In addition to tho above figures, 21 aeroplanes and 283 engines have been delivered from the 1st April to the 2nd June by French and Anvrio.&apos;.ai Manufacturers*

9 seaplanes were delivered in the week ending 2nd Juno.

She output of engines during the last week has continued to suffer from the effect of the recent strikes, and has also been affected by the difficulties encountered in connection with the 200 hcp0engines to which allusion has been made in earlier reports, and which are now in course of being ovoroome.
