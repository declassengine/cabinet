From General Barter to C.I.G.S.      ^ ^

^08o. Secret. Brusilov returned yesterday from a short visit to &quot;k^e northern and western fronts and communicated the following in the course of an interview given this morning

&quot;Offensive will certainly take place, beginning on south west front on June 25th, on Western front July 3rd, and on the northern and Roumanian fronts on July 14th, all dates in our style.

He was,he says,on the whole,satisfied with his visits.Discipline and fighting spirit had undoubtedlj*&quot; improved,but there were still a large number of soldiers whose sole desire was to go home and enjoy their new liberty in dividing up the land.

The most dependable fronts are in the following order: Roumanian south western, western and northern&quot;.

Although Brusilov states that he can guarantee nothing, he hopes for the best. Some members of the staff are more pessimistic. My personal view is that it is regrettable that the first offensive is ^ot taking place on the Roumanian front,but unfortunately the requisite artillery and material could not be concentrated there in time, t propose to visit the south west front,leaving here on Saturday ,rgt. I shall remain for the offensive,and shall thereafter proceed ^0 -bfre Roumanian front, so as to be present at the initiation of offensive there.     I expect to return about July 20th. .^ce Trubettski, Chief of the Political section here, has returned L Moscow.     There he has been studying the situation and making

jigements for counter propaganda ? to meet Lenin.   He states that n ^ood could be effected if the necessary funds were available.

A newspaper is being started, which will be distributed chiefly among the soldiers.    He says that the troops at Moscow aro bef^^-disciplined than thpse in Potrograd. What most struck him was the acute (?) weariness of all intelligent classes with the present chaotic condition of political affairs, even amongst those who were originally in favour of the Revolution.

There seemed to be a marked tendency in favour of establishing a constitutional monarchy.

He also referred to the unpleasant impression created amongst oducated men by severe, dyiticisms which havo appeared in some English newspapers, particularly in a recent Issuo of tho &quot;Sunday Times&quot; 

According to him, those articles strengthen the hands f)f the extreme party, and have seriously prejudicial effeot on the efforts of the moderate and patriotic party, of which he is himsolf an influential mombor..

Command of west front has been given to General Denikin, C.G S&lt;, here?     He will be roplaced by General Lukomski, formerly Q.M G. here,

I may add that the Roumanian Chief of Military Mission has expressed the nope that I would not be prevented from entrance to Roumania.      A visit has for long been expected to the King of Roumar.ia as C.in C&gt; on the Roumanian front, My arrival has already boen announced, and I am informed that a visit from the Chief of the Military Mission here would bo greatly appreciated by the King.
