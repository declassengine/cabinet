1.     Amongst the various problems of social reform which will have to be taken in hand on the conclusion of the.war, the first place must be given to the question of housing.

2o     For years before the war it was admitted on all h^nds that more ought to bo done to improve housing conditions^   Hot only was there a deficiency in many places in the nuaf? *^ o\i houses available, but many of the houses in use wera sac a as could not be regarded, on modem standards, as fit for habitation, and although a great deal of improvement of unfit houses wag effected in 1914 and the years immediately preceding, much still remains to be done. The state of things which was bad before the War has become much worse.   The pftortage of houses which was serious in 1914 is new much intensified owing to the gradual cessation of building during the war.   Estimates of the shortage in England and V&apos;ples vary from 150,000 to 500,000.   In any case the figure is a very large one.   1 hear on all sides of over-crowding and its attendant ills, of the effect of bad, housing&apos; on morals, character and health - in pax&apos;ticul&amp;r of its relation to infant mortality, to tuberculosis and to other forms of disease, and of the discontent engendered amon^ the working classes by all these things. All political patties before the war were agreed that further action should be taken, and the necessity will be much more pronounced when the war is over.

3* .   For a considerable period before the war at least 95 per cent, of the houses of the working classes had been erected by private enterprise.   The high price of&quot; materials and labour snd the high rate of interest which


will rule when the war ends, combined with other causes, must have $ deterrent effeot upon private enterprise. Consequently, at a time when the need for housing will

greater than ever, there will he less incentive to private enterprise to meet the demand.

4.     I have received a number of deputations on this latter.   All have pressed upon me the necessity of having a definite programme prepared to meet the housing needs of the nation after the end of the war.   I have also after consultation with tho Reconstruction Committee set up a Conference m representative men to consider the whole question and advise upon the policy to be adopted.

6.     As | result of these deliberations I em firmly convinced that, if houses are to be bull*, in sufficient numbers ^d rapidly after the end of the w ,r, a substantial measure of financial assistance must be given by the State. I do not propose to discuss here the form which it should iake, - whether by grant of a portion of the outlay or by a loan on easy terms or otherwise - but whatever form is chosen it is clear thp.t the burden on the State must run into many :aillions.   If 300,000 houses are to be built in the first 2 or 3 years after the war and the State were to bear one third of the cost, the commitment of the Exchequer would be approximately  30,000,000.   I do not of oouree suggest that State d.s9istance for housing should become part of our permanent policy, but I oaa convinced of its necessity as a temporary expedient.   I do not at this stage wish to commit myself definitely to an opinion that State assistance should be confined to Local Authorities-

6.     The Conference recommend that steps should Immediately be taken to obtain precise evidence of thfit

shortage throughout the country, and with that end they have drawn up a series of questions to he addressed to all Local Authorities.   The questions nre designed to elicit information as to the existing accommodation, the present and future needs and the steps which the Authorities are prepared to take.     In my opinion and in that of tho Conference the practical results likely to ensue from any Questionnaire of this kind will not justify the time end labour involved unless it is accompanied by a definite assurance of substantial assistance on behalf of the Government, for either a limited period after the war (say five years) or until the reservoir of housing has been filled up by the building of (say) 300,000 houses.

7.     I therefore press upon the Cabinet that I may be given authority to promise substantial assistance, but without indicating the form or actual amount.
