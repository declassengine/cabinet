It is estimated that 15,CCC public school boys and civil servants, in addition to the National Service Volunteers and women, v/ill be available for rrork on the land for the Hay and Corn Harvests this year.

-a-

Tho number of skilled men taken by the Military Authorities from the land since 1916 is about 30,000, and it must be borne in mind that there is a very considerable increase in the area of land under cultivation. This malces it imperative that more labour should be available this year than last, apart from the new programme for 1918 which is still under consideration.

In Scotland.     The number of men lent by the Army due to be recalled on 25th July next is 1,250. The number of men in Agricultural Companies is 500 instead of 2,000, their full strength, (b) General.

Nearly all the appointments of Sub-Area Substitution Officers have been made in all Areas of importance.

Col. Courtenay, C.B., the Chief Substitution Officer, and his assistants are on a tour of inspection of the munitions Area Recruiting Offices.

Further reports confirm the impression derived from Reports made by the Substitution Officers that up to the present there has been no demand for substitutes, for the reason that no mon are being released from Munition Forks for Military Service.     Such volunteers as have been placed have been by way of reinforcement and not of substitution.

Col. Courtenay will advise tho Department, after consultation with the Area Substitution Officers, what, further appointments, if any, are necessary to be made in Sub Areas. r/Oir&apos;EN&apos;S sacTion.
