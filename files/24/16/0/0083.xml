Dear Hankey,

I enclose a letter from Lord Balfour of Burleigh forwarding a copy of a resolution of his Committee on the subject of Merchant Shipbuilding.    It is quite possible that the Reconstruction Committee may wish to make.some observations on the resolution, but as we are not meeting till next Wecnesday end Lord Balfour regards the matter as one of extreme urgency, I thought it would be best to forward it &apos; immediately to you without waiting for the views of the Recohstruc-tion Committee, which can follow.

Yours,

Government will take those recommendations into their ipnediate and most serious consideration, with-a viev/ to the adoption of a programme of merchant shipbuilding on.a scale adequate to safeguard our mercantile position both:in the present grave emergency and in regard,to the very difficult shipping sitii&amp;tion which:/will. &amp;riee. after the war. f||]

MEMORIAL ADDKSSSEt) TO THE PRESIDENT, BOARD 0? TBAD1, BY THE DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE OH SHIPPING AID SHIPBUILDING. &quot;

Sir,

In order to carry out the task entrusted to us by your predecessor,, we have necessarily had to give our earnest consideration to the &apos;shipbuilding policy pursued by His Majesty&apos;s Government since the outbreak of hostilities;

2;     As a result we are impelled, as a Committee representing shipowners,.shipbuilders and marine engineers to record the grave anxiety&apos;with which we view-the present and more especially the prospective position of the British mercantile marine.

3. We recognise to the full the formidable nature of the difficulties that have beset.the Government throughout the war, especially in view of our heavy military obligations;   and we, therefore, abstain, so far as .possible, from ;detailed, criticism which could1 Berve no useful purpose. . y.i j&quot;.

4. Nevertheless we are obliged to state our considered opinion that the policy which neglected the.building of merchant ships lathe United Kingdom was fatally mistaken,, and is responsible for our present difficulties and our future peril.

(i) Not only have we failed to utilise the great resources of our yards for repairing the wastage inseparable from naval: war, but we.: have allowed the output of merchant ships to fall far below the standard of normal times..    Thus.the natural growth of the mercantile marine was artificially restricted at the very.time when every nerve ehould have been strained to make good the ravages of a devastating war.

(ii) The neglect of merchant shipbuilding disregarded the axiom of naval war that the upkeep of the merchant fleet in war is as necessary to a country dependent on sea comraunl cat ions. as. the maintenance of the

&apos;   fighting fleet itself..   .Had that principle received due recognition, the conflict between naval and mercantile construction would have been mitigated; and adequate provision would .have been made for merchant shipbuilding,, as part of a larger naval policy necessary for ..the eafety of the country and having the first claim on the national r eeduroee.

(iii) So long aa the past policy is not reversed, the wastage

of our mercantile marine will continue unchecked. But that wastage is cumulative and: progressive;   and thera cannot fail to come a time, in the not distant future, when&apos; the position will be one of extreme, gravity, and we shall lose, perhaps for ever, that maritime ascendancy, which is the essence of our being.   Without a Strong.,-and supreme merchant navy, econOmiiB reeoa  etruetion after the war would be impossible and the promise of imperial consolidation unfulfilled.

5. Even now we doubt whether the essential danger of the situation is fully realised and whether such efforts as are made do not proceed rather from the exigencies of the moment than from an adequate realisation of the imperial issue at stake. For instead of pressing forward the construction of merchant ships at home, efforts are being made to improvise merchant shipbuilding on a large scale in the United States

- a policy which), whatever its effect on the War, must, unless accompanied by a decisive effort in this country, hasten our own ultimate decline.

6. We are convinced that the situation demands the immediate inception of a bold programme of merchant shipbuilding

in this country on a scale of output amounting to not less than 3,000,000 ton3 a year, as the only means of safeguarding our position both now and in the future.    It is the grave duty of this Committee to warn His Majesty&apos;s Government that, unless a decisive effort is made, the shipping ahd shipbuilding industries of the country, with all that depends on them, will be compromised beyond redemption.

7. Whatever the difficulties inherent in the problem, it

is our confident belief that they can be overcome by the organised effort and the unreserved co-operation of all concerned; and we venture to urge, with all the earnestness in our power, that the question should receive the most urgent attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and that the whole situation should be reviewed in the light of these grave considerations.  

8. We should be glad, to be informed at an early date of the steps which it is proposed to take in order to meet the pressing needs of the situation.

We have the honour to be, Sir,

Your obedient Servants,
