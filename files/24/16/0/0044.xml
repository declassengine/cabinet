Your telegram 35669.    There vould be no further use in sending further heavy artillery for the present under existing conditions at the fror.t except for the following reasons.    As there is the chance that a successful offensive may alter the whole situation and an a complete stoppage of despatch of heavy artillery would at the present moment cause a very bad impression pending results of coming Russian offensive I ?.-o\;.ld surest that only heavy artillery not required on British front might be sent to Russia*. I do not consider that there will be any use in sending more heavy artillery to Russia if offensive is unsuccessful.

With reference to your 35669 to Military Attache, Petrograd.-   Vickers type 31 8&quot; Howitzers-.   IS have &quot;been sent to front.-   12 are mobilized but wait for transport. Remainin, 7 are held in reserve.

Vickers type 8 12&quot; howitzers.   6 have been sent to front but are not in action*   Remaining two will be kept in reserve. t j$!

9.2 howitzers.   One battery now complete and expected to go to front in 10 days.   0&quot; howitzers British service type. Two batteries complete except for loading Trays which have been lost in transit chiefly due to faulty method of shipment from England.   They are expected to go to front in 10 day3 with locally made loading trays.   Tractors for 8&quot; and 9.2&quot; howitzers have only recently arrived.

6&quot; howitzers.   Two batteries with motor transport are at the front.

6 further batteries now completed and under ryrders .for front.   Remaining batteries still incomplete as regards equipment.   Parts are probably now discharging at Archangel.

60 pr. At present no batteries at front. Tomorrow I shall be at Moscow and will wire  u*ll particulars of conditions there.   At least one battery ready for front.

4.5&quot; hovdtzers.   There are 252 howitzers in action on front*   Further 72 are now mobilizing with 6 new Russian divisions.   Remainder held in army and general reserve. I consider reserves of guns are too large, and J am trying to get more on front.   Expenditure on front not definitely .known, but very small; practically nil with heavy artillery.

The caus,e of many of the delays is absence of sights and other parts due to faulty shipping in England*   I consider general situation here does not warrant any further shipments of heavy artillery but 1 now await results of proposed offensive.   The whole situation hangs on the result of this, and therefore, I recommend that no definite decision as regards official reduction of our programme should be made as this might handicap the influence now working towards a renewal cf offensive-.

In the event of improvement resulting in the near future, I should at once recommend renewal of shipment of heavy batteries but probably on a scale of 4 6&quot; howitzer batteries per month for 6 months and no other nature?, as full use is not made of heavier types and local conditions are against them*

I should also put forward a strong recommendation fcr trench-mortars.   Two months will roughly be the time from unloading at Archangel to action.
