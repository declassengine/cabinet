I beg to submit the following Report of the Pood Production Department for the week ending 12th June:*

LOCAL ORGANISATION. Work of Agricultural Executive Committees.

The following are instances of action taken during the week with regard to specific pieces of land:-

0ambridgeshire.   The Executive Committee are taking possession of a grass farm of 160 acres near Newmarket, and propose breaking up 120 acres for corn with the consent of the owner, who is unable to do the work himself owing to infirmity.

Hampshire. The Committee are arranging for the cultivation of 400 acres of down land near Martin;    this land belongs to four different farms and is no?/ Used as a sheep-run;   the sheep are to be allocated to a piece of maiden down sufficient for the needs of the flocks of all the four farms, and the tenants are themselv&lt;&quot;r8 to cultivate the rest of their land.

Worcestershire.   The Committee are taking possession of 16g acres of neglected land near Kings Norton upon which there are nine stacks of hay, the produce of the land for nine consecutive years, ending in 1914.     The land will be let to an efficient tenant, Monmouthshire.   The Committee have taken possession of Pen-y-Coed Castle Farm (245 acres in extent) with the consent of the owner, Lord Rhondda, who has agreed to cultivate it on behalf of the Committee and without expense to the State,

Drainage of Land,

Reports have been received from the Department&apos;s Drainage Inspector of inspections of lands in the valleys of the Derwent, Foss, | yle and other rivers in the North and East Ridings, and of various areas in the Isle of Axholme and other parts of Lindsey, including the valley of the River Ancholme.     These reports have been sent to the Agricultural Executive Committees and other authorities concerned.     The Inspector has gone to Carnarvonshire and Merionethshire at the request of the Agricultural Executive Committees of these counties to advise as to action that may bo taken under the Drainse of Lands Orders there, and has arranged to make inspections of further areas in Norfolk, Lancashire and Westmorland on his return from Wales,

Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No. 2).

Reports from 946 Boroughs or Urban Districts show that 174,883 applications for plots have been made, and 157,564 plots, containing a total area of 11,702 acres, have been provided . under the Order.

HORTICULTURAL SECTION.

The horticultural representatives appointed by the Department now number 441.     During the week particulars have been received of 14 new Pood Production Societies which have been formed.     13,000 pamphlets on technical subjects (fruit bottling, etc.) have been distributed during the week.     Orders have been received for 5,500 dozen glass jars for bottling. Fruit and Vegetable Bottling.     The third class for training instructors was opened on 4th June.     14 travelling instructors are now at work in different parts of the country, and demonstrations have been given during the week at Croydon, Wimbledon, Derby and Walsall.     Travelling instructors are being employed to train local instructors for work in their several districts.     By this means each county should^ in a short time, be able to make the necessary provision for meeting its own requirements for instruction in fruit and vegetable preserving.

Potato Spraying.     1,593 Knapsack Spraying Machines have been sold during the past week bringing the total number of sales up to 4,178.     The total number of cases of spraying material sold now . amounts to 22,585.     Demonstrations held at Aldershot have led to a decision to spray considerable areas of potatoes which are being grown by the Army.     In the early potato district of Penzance the spraying machines and chemicals supplied by the Department are already being used.     Demonstrations in spraying have been provided during the week in 14 different counties.

Gardening in Public.Schools.      Returns have been received from 82 public schools with a total attendance of 21,300 boys showing the action taken by them in respect of a circular letter issued by this Department to headmasters a few months ago urging the importance of the cultivation of garden ground at all schools.     Of the 82 schools, a considerable amount of gardening is being carried on at 56.

TECHNICAL DIVISION.

Sources of Potash.   During the past three months the sources of Potash which are available, or might be secured for use, in the United Kingdom have been investigated.   A report has been submitted on the following:-   Blast Furnace Flue Dust; Felspar (English or Scotch); Leucite (Italian); Glauconite (English); Sylvite (Abyssinian); Sea Water; Wool Washing; Kelp; Wood Ashes. Of the English sources two, namely Flue Dust and Wool Washing, are of great importance.   The former has already been taken up by the Ministry of Munitions. It is estimated that the wool washed in this country may contain as much as 20,000 tons of carbonate of potash. Practical processes for its extraction have not hitherto been devised, but success is claimed for a recent invention and these claims are being investigated. Wild White Clover.    In vie?* of the present shortage of Wild White Clover seed a Bulletin has been issued urging the Importance of securing the largest possible crops this year and giving advice as to harvesting and threshing.

Breaking up Grass Land. The suitability of ploughing implements in general use for the breaking up of old turf is being considered by a special Committee.   Applications for advice with respect to the ploughing of permanent pasture have been received from, among others, the Somerset Farmers&apos; Union and the East Suffolk Agricultural Executive Committee.   Detailed advice has been sent. Supply of Hay for the Army, i Suggestions have been made respecting the treatment of second crops of clover and rye grass in 1917.

Supplies of Concentrated Feeding Stuffs. Estimates of the probable supplies available during the coming winter have been examined; from the information available at present it appears probable that

the supply available in the year ending 31st May 1917 will be about five eighths of the amount used in the past year. Plant Diseases. Experts in various districts have consented to act as correspondents, and warn the Department of impending outbreaks of disease. They have already reported attacks of a serious wheat pest in the Worth-western counties, and are securing useful information as to the pests occurring in newly-broken grass land. Advice has been given in a number of cases of out-breaks of disease.

A large number of miscellaneous enquiries have been answered. Notices have been communicated to the London and Provincial Press on:- ensilage and winter fodder; the sale of hares; fruit-bottling facilities; thistles- in corn; prices of sulphate of ammonia; provision of potato spraying machines; cost of rabbits; lifting of immature potatoes; and destruction of pheasants.

LABOUR.

Harvest Labour. Numerous requests for labour assistance at the hay and corn harvests have been received both from individual farmers and Agricultural Executive Committees. Estimates of the labour required received from Agricultural Executive Committees have been transmitted to the National Service Department, the Committees being at the same time informed that they should state the labour requirements of their county to the District Commissioner of the National Service Department in accordance with the terms of the agreement between the President and the Director-General of National Service.

Prisoners of War.   Pour schemes for the employment of batches of prisoners of war on agricultural work have been received during th&lt; week and sent to the War Office. In addition, the War Office have been asked to add 100 men to the batch of prisoners already at work at Evesham,

WOMEN&apos;S BRANCH.

All reports: received this week lay stress on the fact that the demand for women workers is far in excess of the supply, thus Indicating a complete reversal of the position which existed only a fortnight ago.     The Selection Committees are passing only a small proportion of the women volunteering for National Service, and it has become imperative that an increased supply of recruits should be secured.

Returns have been received this week from all counties except Huntingdon and the Holland Division of   Lincoln.     These show that 4,421 National Service recruits hiave been accepted, and 5,208 rejected.     Of the 4,421, full particulars are available of 3,943 as follows:- 1,884 were undergoing training, either on farms or in teaching centres;    1,237 were actually being employed on farm work, and the remainder were waiting either to be placed in employment or at training centres.     Since these figures were oompiled, however, nearly all the women waiting for employment have been placed with farmers.     Information is available now respecting 106 vacancies for women on farms which cannot be filled;   but 214 women are passing out of training centres within a week.

The attitude of farmers towards the employment of women is undergoing a steady change.     One Inspector reports that the official backing for the employment of women, which was given in connection withifcie setting up of Labour Sub-Committees in each county, has been an enormous help.     It is interesting to note the different values which are placed on women&apos;s work in different parts of the country. La North Wales, for example, it is stated that the farmers scoff at the idea of women workers being worth 18/- a week, while in South Wales it is reported that in no case has an employer offered merely the minimum 18/- a week.     The average has been 18/- with a furnished cottage, milk and vegetables, or  1 a week with a cottage, or from 7/- to 10/- a week if hoard, lodging and washing are provided.

36 Group Leaders have now been appointed, 4 additional Leaders having been supplied by the Department this week. There are still vacancies in six counties.     The increase in the number of women offering themselves for part time employment on the land is a valuable and noticeable feature.     Reports indicate that village and town people are giving more assistance to farmers than ever before, and that in many cases daughters of farmers are remaining at home, who otherwise would have found employment in towns.

MACHINERY AMD IMPLEMENTS. Motor Tractors,   No further tractors have arrived vfrom America during the week.     Seven of the Caterpillar Tractors borrowed from the Russian Government are still at work, together with 83 privately owned motor tractors.

Steam Tackle.     A desire has been expressed by several Executive Committees that they should be authorised to exercise more control over the sets of steam tackle in their counties.     As a general rule, however, it would be unwise to requisition steam tackle from the present owners, who in most cases are anxious that it should be as fully employed as possible.     But in certain cases the owners of steam tackle are disposed to employ it mainly on land which could equally well be dealt with by motor tractors, with the result that arrangements cannot be made to plough up the class of grass land which could only be dealt with satisfactorily by steam cultivation*     A memorandum has, accordingly, been sent to Agricultural Executive Committees suggesting that the Machinery Sub-Committees should endeavour to organise the &apos;.7ork of the sets of steam tackle in their counties in co-operation with the proprietors, so that they may be used to the best advantage in the national interest, and the Committees have been authorised to guarantee to the proprietors payment for any work they undertake at the request or under the directions of the Committees,

SUPPLIES i

Sulphate of Mimonia. As a result of the Departments issue of the new scale of prices, the Fertilisers Manufacturers1 Association is urging all its members to purchase and. store sulphate of ammonia at once. The Department is sending a similar notice to over 3,000 local dealers, co-operative societies, and other likely &quot;buyers,. Steps are being taken to draw the attention of everyone concerned to the greatly reduced price arranged for June - September deliveries.

Owing to the favourable weather, the demand for sulphate of ammonia was maintained right up to the end of May. The deliveries for agricultural use in the United Kingdom in May were approximately 18,000 tons, which brings the total deliveries for the twelve months ending the 31st ult., up to 150,000 tons, as compared with 609000 tons which was the amount of the annual&quot; consumption before the war.

Basic Slag. The production and deliveries of basic slag also continue to be large.   During May the production amounted to 39,000 tons as contpared with about 30,000 tons produced in May, 1916.    Measures for increasing the output and for regulating prices are being concerted with the Ministry of Munitions. Superphosphate. The deliveries of superphosphate during May amounted to slightly over 41,000 tons, (statistics of monthly deliveries last year ore not available).   The imports of rock phosphate during the five months of the present year have been very small, and stocks in the hands of manufacturers are now reduced to 71,000 tons as compared with 113,000 tons at the same date last year.   The Cabinet having decided to provide for the import of 50,000 tons per month, the Ministry of Munitions and the Shipping Controller are being urged to make the necessary arrangements to carry this decision into effect forthwith.


131

Compound Manuros,     Deliveries of compound manures in May amounted to 66,000 tons, and the stock in hand is now only 16,000 tons. The total quantity of compoQaid manures delivered during the five months of this year has been 320,200 tons.

Potash.   The Ministry of Munitions are about to issue an Order controlling the output of flue dust from blast furnaces, and arrangements will be made w ith the Ministry as to the terms and conditions on which the flue dust is to be sold for agricultural purposes.

Seed Corn, Arrangements have been completed to purchase seed corn from the 1916 crop to servo as a reserve against local shortages. A travelling Commission has been appointed to buy selected varieties from the 1917 crop.     A representative Advisory Committee has been set up to assist in organising the work of selection, storage and distribution.

Seeds (other than cereals).     A representative Advisory Committee has been appointed to organise provision for the coming season&apos;s requirements.

I am,

Sir,

Your obedient Servant,

Director General,

The Rt.Hon.Rowland E.Prothero, M.P.,

President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.
