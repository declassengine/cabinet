From Viceroy, Armi/ Dcpartme7it, iolh June 19.17. (Received at India Office, 11.45 p.m.)

8680. Your telegram of 25th ultimo to Foreign and Political Department regarding Buchanan together with our No. 7185 of 16th June (sic) were repeated to General Officer Commanding and the following reply received :  

&quot; Both Cox and I are of opinion that it is necessary to have an expert whom we may consult regarding questions of permanent irrigation. Conservancy. Cox considers that Buchanan would do well for this purpose but is not prepared to say that there is no one else who would do as well. I do not consider services of Buchanan should be (secured ?) for the Reasons that (1) 1 understand that he is not an irrigation expert, and (2) the salary he would naturally expe&apos;ct would be excessive for the duties* to be carried out. Both Cox and I agree that G arrow, if qualified, would be suitable. Cox is of opinion that he should be attached to Civil Administration, but 1 consider that having regard to responsibilities of Inland Water Transport this would be unwise so long as war conditions prevail.&quot;

While inclined to think that for reasons given by Cox in his telegram No. 2015 that expert would more usefully be attached to Civil Administration we do not regard this point as of great importance provided that civil authorities are allowed to communicate direct with expert and that expert is always consulted in all schemes affecting water-ways and irrigation projects, and that his views are always brought by Inland Water Directorate to the notice of Army Commander before decision is made. In connection with above please see telegram No. X. 5405, dated Sth June from General Officer Commanding, Force &quot;D.&quot;
