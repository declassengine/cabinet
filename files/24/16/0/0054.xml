 1.   SWEDEN. Sir 2. Howard has informed the Swedish Government

that we would allow temporary supplies of certain commodities , which are urgently required by Sweden, to pass through the Blockade upon receiving an assurance that neither these imports nor their equivalent nor their products will be re-exported to the enemy. Admiral. Lindman, who fully realises the dangerous position In whioh Sweden now stands owing to shortage at home and her dependence upon the Unite &amp; States for certain supplies, seems ready to give this assurance if definite quantities of supplies are promised within a definite period.   He has further promised to consider an arrangement by whioh Russian transit facilities shall be given for goods already in Scandinavia on condition that a proportionate quantity of similar goods is allowed to reach Sweden for home consumption.

L. SEHMARK- We have informed the Danish Government that their

proposals for an Agreement regarding exports of fish from Denmark are inacoeptafele;   and our intention is to withhold supplies of mineral oil from Denmark until some more satisfactory settlement of the fish question is offered.   The Standard Oil and Asiatic Petroleum Companies have been informed that no facilities can at present be given for the examination at Halifax of tank vessels carrying petroleum to Denmark.

It appears that the threatened pressure upon the

Aluminium factories which supply the Allies has not the approval of the Norwegian Prime Minister, Ao promises that there shall he no interference with the export of aluminium pending the conclusion of an amicable arrangement for the supply of Norwegian requirements.

A law has been passed giving the Norwegian Government control over the charters of Norwegian merchant shipping.   She execution of the law is delegated to the Norwegian Ship Owners&apos; Association. This should facilitate the conclusion of a satisfactory Shipping Agreement between ourselves and the Association. Apparently there is a general desire in Norwegian shipping and official circles to oonolude such an Agreement on the basis of our proposals.   Norwegian Delegates will come to London for further discussions at an early date. Shore are still several difficulties outstanding; in particular we are anxious to secure fall power of deciding in what trades the vessels placed at our disposal shall be used.   But there is good reason to believe that these difficulties can be satisfactorily settled.

IS. She effect of the proposals whioh the Spanish -m

Government desire to substitute for the Cortina Agreement, would be to diminish the quantity of Spanish shipping placed at our disposal; to make our supplies of Spanish Iron Ore contingent on the fulfilment of onerous conditions; and to Impose upon us an unconditional obligation of supplying Spain with coal. She intention of H.M.Gov-*s&amp; iernment is, while refusing these proposals, to continue W .-negotiations in a leisurely manner bo long as Spanish

shipments of iron ore to this country remain satisfactory.   It is hoped that the United States will continue to withhold supplies of Araerloan coal from Spain, since this is the easiest method of bringing pressure to hear upon the Spanish Government.

SWITZERLAND.      She German Government are endeavouring to insist that no German material of any kind shall he used in the manufacture of munitions by Swiss factories for the Allies.   Should this policy he carried out the Allies will find themselves obliged to send considerable supplies of coal and ooke to Switzerland for the use of these factories.   At the present moment France is receiving from Switzerland considerable quantities of iron and steel and machine tools, and Great Britain is receiving considerable quantities of manufactured copper, which are all required for military purposes. The Allies in general also depend on Switzerland to some extent for supplies of motors aad electrical machines which are doubtless regarded by Germany as Munitions.

&apos;   ITALY. An Agreement has been drafted at Paris, and

approved in principle by H M. Government, for stopping the trade between Italy and Germany in Thrown Silk. Italy will agree to prohibit the export of all undyed thrown silk and sitw will only permit the export to Switzerland of a fixed ration consigned to the S.S.S. Her Allies in return will buy the whole of the remaining exportable surplus of Italian thrown silk. It is estimated that the quantity to be purchased by

the Allies would amount to 15,000 quintals, and the cost to 135,000,000 franca. Italian banks are prepared to advance 75$ of the purchase money.

SOUTH AMERICA.      Before the end of the our rent year the Argentine Government will have to meet obligations in Sew York amounting to    45,000*000*   They count upon being able to renew these loans;   but we have suggested to the United States Government that the American Banks concerned might be willing to refuse the required accommodation until the Argentine Government consents to oblige the Allies further in such matters as the export of wheat and the requisitioning of enemy ships.

UNITED STATES.   I.M* Government have lai. d before the United States Government a schedule of the concessions which might be demanded from the Scandinavian countries and Holland as a condition of receiving United States products. Briefly the demands are for

(a) Total prohibition of certain exports to Germany, the list of articles varying in the case of each of the countries concerned*

(b) The continuance of present exports to Allied countries.

Sweden would further be required to abolish her present   restrictions on Russian transit and to resume her shipping

services to the United Kingdom.   These demands constitute a maximum programme whioh may well serve as a basis of negotiation with the countries concerned.

The United States Department of Commerce desire to take over the control and distribution of those


British commodities (rubber, wool, jute etc.) which have hitherto been consigned to British Consular Officers.   We are prepared to aooept the proposal, though we trust that the Department of Commerce will not relax the existing precautions against the reexport of these commodities to neutral countries.

She State Department have invited the Ireneh vand British Censorships to take drastic measures for the prevention of undesirable exchange business between American and Heutral European Banks. At present the United States Censorship is insufficiently,5 equipped with information and with legal powers for the purpose.

A proposal comes from Washington that the purchase and supply of Mineral Oil for Allied account and a control of oil tank ships should be centralised at Washington in the hands of an official committee representing all the Allies.   She United States are the main source from which the Allies derive mineral oil and more than half the tonnage engaged in this trade 1b American controlled.   It would therefore Seem reasonable that control should be exercised from Washington rather than from Irondon.   The object of the control will be to secure economy in purchasing and a wise distribution of the available supplies.
