fe^ek, encled jStiu June. 1917.

1(b) S^TLEKKITS.

A large number of disputes have been settled by the

Munitions Department none being of any special importance. One interesting case is mentioned in which 50 toolsetters and labourers employed at a bullet factory threatened t o strike as a protest against the promotion of a conscientious objector to the position of foreman.   The  man was dismissed and the matter thus settled.

Clyde. It is reported that the Clyde V/orkers&apos; Committee has

been broken up, the majority of its members having been absorbed in the newly constituted Engineering and Shop Stewards Committee and the remainder in the organisation known as MThe&apos; Industrial Workers of&apos;Great Britain.&quot;

Egkshire. A secret meeting of the Leeds Shop Stewards was held

on June 1st at which it was decided to call a strike for the 6th June as a protest against the failure of Government to withdraw the Dilution Bill.   No, strike.has, however taken place and the communique issued by the Ministry of Munitions is said to have had a good effect.   There was a good deal of anti-Jewish rioting on 3rd and 4th, due mainly to the number of Jews who have evaded military service,   A great deal of damage was done to property.

The Leeds Conference has been dealt with in section V of this Report.

Ki^ands. Prom Coventry it is reported that the skilled

men on time^rates are still discontented &quot;because learners and women are able to earn higher wages at piece work.     Asense of these and similar grievances were no doubt largely responsible for the adhesion of numbers of otherwise loyal men to the leaders in the rocent stride..

South ffialqa The invitations issued by the Government to Jack

&quot;Hughes, Hoah Prohusn and George Dallinghaai to visit the front in France have given general satisfaction. These men are noted agitators and exercise much influence.

III, PRESS pPffIQNS .

The &quot;Evenings News&quot; of 27th. Kay publishes an interview with Llr. Robert Youngs general secretary of the A..S.E.in which he urges de-centralised control and says &quot;The time is coming., if it has not already come, &quot;when we must have workshop committees, truly represent &quot;ative of the men, which would be able to act. with &quot;regard to all shop grievances, such as rate cutting and &quot;piece work prices.&quot;

On the other hand the &quot;Bulletin&quot; {19 th.iiay) blames the Executives for failure to maintain discipline,, and Mr.Clynes,M.P. is reported in the &quot;Globe&quot; to have said that he looks with concern, amounting at times to alarm, at the tendency of some Unions to set aside their own executive Government and to set up in &quot;Workshops quite new, unofficial and unauthorised forms of representation.

Agenta-

provocatcturs&gt;.    The Nation* the &quot;Statesman&quot;,and the &quot;Eerald&quot; ,.all have outspoken articles on this subject, based on Mr..V..C Anders-on* s speech in the House of Commons &gt; which lis said to have caused general uneasiness.   It is alleged that men of the Gordon type are still being employed and a-categorical assurance is asked for that this is not the case.

IV. GEI^SFAL. REMARKS.

The Leeds Conference, held on. Sunday last, was a distinct success from the point of&quot; view- of its promoters. It was a: large and orderly gathering, and its composition as reported even in the &quot;Times* could not but impress uncritical opinion, as representative -&quot;Some 1150 persons &quot;attended,nominally as delegates-..... of the total 209 came &quot;from Trades Councils and. local Labour Parties,.371 from ttTr-7ido Union- executives and branches,. 29 S from the Independent Labour Party, 88 from the British Socialist Party, :Jtt4 from Women*-3 organisations,, and the. rest from various


-3~

various bodies including the ITational Council for Civil Liberties and the Union of Democratic Control*91 The cost of the Conference is believed to have been  7000, and in many cases all expenses weredrtfr&amp;yed. Presumably they were borne by the pacifist organisations.

An analysis of the figure*, however, proves how small is the legitiLtf.te claim that the conference was in any sense representative      Labour*   Of the 1150 &quot;delegates&quot; 580 are stated by the promoters to have been deputed by &quot;Trades Councils&quot;,local labour parties and Trade Union &quot;executives and-branches&quot;.. :  Hone of the^   Trsde Union Executives were incited to send delegates or were officialls represented.

Mr. Robert Sail lie and kr.Kbbert Williams were present in their pacifist and revolutionary capacity respectively, rather than as representative &amp;  the unions to which they belong, and it aay&apos;be accepted that the same remar&amp;s apply to the very largo majority of the 530 quasi~labour delegates.

The Trades Councils,are, with few exceptions, bodies which carry little weight in the Labour world. Those of Leeds, of Birmingham, and of Newcastle are probably the only three of which the influence is generally admit-ted among the Trade Unionists of the towns which they represent. *   Many of the larger Unions, including notably-the A.S.S. and the Boilermakers, refuse to have dealings with any Trades Council, and the fact that 20G of those attending the Leeds Conference came from Trades Councils cannot be said to implicate Labour in the movement. Thifc was made clear in the meetings both at Birmingham and at Leeds itself, at which the delegates for the Conference were chosen.   In both cases there was keen opposition on the ground that delegates could not be said to represent the men in the shops.

The same argument applies to Trade Union branches-. A&apos;member wouid find it a simple &amp;atter to obtain permission froxs his branch tto attend a conference, specially, if h&lt; i3 recognised as a forceful members of the group. It is indeed remarkable that only 371 delegates of this class attended, and any claim that the conference represented organised British&apos;labour is disproved by this fact,for Trade Unions number over 1300 and branches amount to scores of thousands.

A further point worth rioting is the undemocratic character of the procedure.   All amendments to the resolutions were ruled out of order arid the &quot;Provisional   . j|p Council&quot; elected itself, although strong protests were made by some of the delegates&apos;.   This aspect cf the proceedings is interesting in view of the advocacy of. &quot;free speech&quot; and &quot;rahte and file* methods by the promoters of the Conference.

Though   it is cXfeax ttast the Leeds Conference was in no fcsnse competent to voice the opinions and d^aiids of Labour, but was rather- a .political Cave of AdulLam, to which report was had by the discontented and disgruntled of various parties&apos;, each in itself without far reaching influence, it would ba a mistake in policy to dismiss it from consideration as-negligible*


- Unless the authorit&amp;tivo representatives of Labour -make it quite clear to the world that the views of the Conference are not the views of organised Labour, it will be taken largely at its ov/n valuation in allied, neutral, and encray countries  Moreover, the Conference itselfwas intended to be the. starting point of a widespread agitation to enforce and disseminate the views expressed.     Unless these views, therefore, are ignored by the responsible leaders cf the Labour movement, they are likely to spread to a dangerous extent, though it may be noted that, when analysed, the difference between the bpneeption of peace terms voiced by Mr* Snowden* s not so far apart from those which have been officially put forward as is commonly represented, or as Mr. Snowden probably wished the public to suppose*rC*&apos;-

The manifesto, drafted by Mr. Snowden on behalf of the United Socialist Council and issued before the Leeds Meeting proclaimed that &quot;The Leed3 Convention will devise the plan of campaign. All Labour,. Socialist and democratic bodies must get ready to take their part in it    Now is the time to realise the international call &quot;Workera of all Lands,Unite? The telegram sent by the Conference to

the Russian-Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council was in the following terms: - &quot;The. largest and greatest convention of Labour, Socialist and; Democratic bodies hold in Grant Britain during this generation:iia3 today endorsed Russia&apos;s declaration of foreign policy and war aims, and hap pledge itself to work through its newly constitutjed ATorkmen*s and Soldiers* Council for an immediate democratic peace,1&apos;

It may therefore bo taken as certain th$$ a widespread pacifist agitation deliberately -based on the Russian model will be.initiated with the intention to embarrass authority. &apos;The proposal to institute   Committee of \7ork-meh^s-and Soldiers&apos; Delegates is an earnest of this, though it is unlilcely that such an organisation will ma.^e muoh hoadv;ay against thclargo number of rival representa-tisne   bodies already in existence.

Reference has also been made in the Report of Kay 23rd. to the need for extensive propaganda, with a .view to bringing hosie the objects and ..nature -of the  ar to the industrial centres^ - and to revive-the early enthusiasm which has to some extent subsided,    If it is possible.to publish&apos; detailed, accounts of the work of individual  , British Regiments .it would probably help a good deal in this direction. The other conditions which favour pacifist agitations at the present moment have already been dealt with iri&apos; tho two previous Reports, but attention may be drawn to the unsettling effect of tho economic demands put forward by&apos;the workers in Russia, which assists the work which will be carried out by the ^.legates to tha.\ Leeds Conference on their return homo. There are already signs that the successes both socially.and economically produced by the Revolution are beginnignto cause a revulsion of feeling in this country, and the .- spectacle


spectacle of economic chaos which is lilcely to ensue will furnish a lesson more effective.than any other argument in the eyes of the sober-minded &quot;workers of this country. It may be suggested,&quot; however, that it i3 desirable that the fullest publicity shall be given to the results produced by the attempt   to enforce impossible demands as to toagas and conditions in Russia.
