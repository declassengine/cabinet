WAR. CABINS (l1. Bpdy Armour.

Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for War.

With reference to my note of 14th April, 1917, further reports have now been received from Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig and from Lieiitenant General Maude, with regard to, body armour.

Both reports show that, while these breastplates have been found valuable in small raids, bombing and other minor enterprises, they are too heavy and interfere too much with the free use of rifle and spade to make them practicable for universal use or for big attacks.

Our Army Commanders in Prance prefer the later and lighter design of body armour (weighing 6  lbs.) and Sir Douglas Haig has asked for 200 of these breatplates -  *-Divisions&apos;, and adds that no further supplies of the heavy breastplates (14 lbs) should be sent to France.

Effect will be given to his wishes.

DERBY.

19th June, 1917.
