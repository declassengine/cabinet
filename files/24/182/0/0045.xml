f f.g*(26) 50. )CQHIggTEE ON PAY Off; THE ffIGBTING SERVICES;CADET   FEES.Soheme submitted by the war   Office.Basic fee remains  200 p.a.  ____...  70% of each entry.Reduced fees  150 p.a. )to be determined  LOO p.a. )      30$ of each entry,entirely on  50 p.a. )means.Scale of income qualifying for reduced feeUp t6  500 &quot;    11  750 50  100  150  200&quot; n  1,000 frver  1,000In assessing means abatements will be made for children. The fee payable by a parent whose means slightly exceed one of the means limits will be adjusted so that he Is not worse off than he would have been if his means had equalled the limit In question.Sons of offioers and other ranks will be given a rebate of 4-0$ on what they would have paid on the above means scale,  i.e* the rates will be  30 per annum,   60 per annum,   90 per annum, or  120 per annum.Sons of officers and other ranks admitted at  30,   60 and  90 per annum will count against the ZCfjc who may be given reduced fees, but not those at  120 per annum.King1s cadets will pay nil as at present and their establish-ment will remain at 30,  including those in receipt of Educational Allowance.    They will b9 additional to the    30$.It is clear that a soheme of reduced  fees based on means will not admit also of Prize Cadatships granted solely for need. It is therefore proposed to give 50 Prize Cadetships a year, irrespective of means.   A Prize Cadetship will be of the value of  25 a year.    Thus a cadet who is assessed at  200 will be given credit for  25 and his net payment will be  175.    This follows the new practice of Oxford and Cambridge where under the new statutes  30 p.a.  is/-1-
awarded to scholars without    any conditions, the balance of the scholarship benefit being dependent on proof of need.Charge for uniform, books,  etc,   ( 80 at BoMoAo,   70 at E,M.Co) will not continue to be remitted (as at present) as part of a Prise Gaeletship,     ffor the 30% entered at reduced fees, these charges will be reduced in the same proportion as the fees, i.e. by 25%,  50/uj  or 75$ (the 40$ reduction for officers&apos; sons will not apply to these charges).-It is very important not to make public the moans scale or what each cadet is assessed at,   . The disclose their scale but we should not follow them in this respect.     We shall publish the scale of fees and the percentage to be admitted at reduced fees and tho number of prise cadet ships, &quot;but not the means scale or how we shall award the reduced fees^      If this is done no one  (apart from officials) but the father of a boy will know what fee he is paying.The nest examination is June.     The notice goes out early in March. .   There is no practical reason why, the new fees should not then be introduced. It is, however,  questionable whether notice ought not to be given.      In that case the present scale, conditions, and, in case of priae cadets, number should remain unaltered during the notice.It is suggested that the new scheme should not be introduced until Dec. 1927 examination.
