This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1926.CONFIDENTIAL. F 4793/1/10CP. 380 (26).MEMORANDUMBritish Policy in China.THE following memorandum is a continuation of the memorandum for the Cabinet, CP. 308 (26), which consists of three memoranda, dated the 2nd February, 1926, the 19th July, 1926, and the 30th July, 1926, the whole forming a continuous exposition of British policy towards China, having special relation to the problems raised by the Tariff Conference. At the risk of recapitulating much of what appears in these three memoranda it will facilitate a complete understanding of the present position if the present memorandum begins with a brief summary of the course of the Tariff Conference.II.The Washington Conference in 1921 decided that China should be allowed to levy a surtax of 2^ per cent, ad valorem on foreign imports (5 per cent, on luxuries) &quot; as from such date, for such purposes and subject to such conditions as the present Tariff Conference might determine.&quot; In the course of the discussions in the sub-committee at Washington the Japanese delegate, under instructions from his Government, read a statement which he was not at liberty to discuss : It is hoped that the countries interested will adopt a practical arrangement whereby the proper use in future of the additional customs revenue will be assured. In our opinion, the additional revenue should first be used for the service of the foreign loans . . . . ,&quot; by which, of course, was meant the consolidation of the unsecured debt.British policy with regard to these Washington surtaxes aimed at securing guarantees that something substantial should be accomplished of constructive benefit to China, in particular, for example, the abolition of li-kin. We deprecated turning the Tariff Conference into a debt collecting commission, and we were supported by the American Government in the view that the question of the consolidation of the unsecured debt should be entirely eliminated from the agenda of the conference. At a later stage we were gradually forced into the position of recognising that, in order to secure support for our constructive policy, it might be necessary to make some concession to those Powers who were only anxious about their debts.III.When the Tariff Conference opened Sir R. Macleay assured us that consolidation of the unsecured debt was regarded by every Power represented, including China herself, as one of the main objects which the conference had to accomplish, and that we could not afford to stand out alone, as we should be accused of trying to wreck the conference and thereby reap much odium all round. Accordingly, we reluctantly consented to join in the attempt to elaborate a scheme for the consolidation of the unsecured debt.IV,In the meantime the Chinese demand for full tariff autonomy had become more and more violent and insistent, especially after the Shanghai incident of the 30th May, when a wave of nationalism, violently hostile to Great Britain, swept the country from end to end. At this stage our policy was in very close harmony with that of both America and Japan. We agreed that China&apos;s right to tariff autonomy should be recognised in principle, but that tariff autonomy should only be granted gradually and by stages. We desired to implement the promises made at Washington, and we were willing that the scope of the conference should be enlarged so as to permit, if 3681   [15319] B
possible, of a lasting settlement that would conduce to the establishment of a strong and orderly Government in China. This meant that prior to tariff autonomy, and as one of the stages thereto, we were willing to grant, under suitable conditions, surtaxes higher than those contemplated at Washington (note : hence we get the phrases &quot; Washington surtaxes &quot; and &quot; interim surtaxes &quot;), because it was felt that, if we were to have debt consolidation, some further revenue would be necessary in order to make possible any of those measures of constructive benefit to China which we, in particular, had in mind.V.The Tariff Conference opened on the 26th October last, and within three weeks was stampeded into agreeing to a resolution definitely granting China tariff autonomy on the 1st January, 1929. The same resolution contained an undertaking by China that she should abolish li-kin by that date, but the two were not expressed as being interdependent. This quasi-immediate grant of tariff autonomy raising the prospect of vastly greater customs revenues flowing through foreign hands from the provinces to Peking created an entirely new situation calling for a new orientation of policy. Certain other developments urged us in the same direction. There was a sudden leap in the estimate of the unsecured debt, which was now found to be about treble any figure previously mentioned; debt consolidation as proposed by the foreign delegations was based on rigid and absolute foreign control over the whole of the customs revenue (vastly increased by tariff autonomy as noted above), which raised in acute form the questions of provincial concurrence and danger to the Maritime Customs Administration; and finally it transpired that the Chinese were after all strongly opposed to any scheme of debt consolidation being brought within the scope of the Tariff Conference at all : they were willing to elaborate and put before their creditors a scheme for consolidating the unsecured debt, but they claimed that this was a matter which touched the sovereignty and independence of China, and should be dealt with outside the conference. This attitude of the Chinese coincided exactly with our original view. We now felt very strongly that the dangers involved in debt consolidation by the conference were graver than ever, and, as a result of an interchange of views, Sir R. Macleay gave us an assurance that the debt consolidation scheme would not form part of the treaty which was being negotiated by the conference, but would be dealt with outside the conference. He still considered it essential that it should be dealt with in some such way, and that we should lend our support in order to obtain the support of the other delegations for the scheme for the abolition of li-kin which had been elaborated by our delegation.VI.Up to the end of February the Chinese delegation had refused to discuss the Washington surtaxes because they feared that the Powers might hastily grant these surtaxes and then, having fulfilled the promises made at Washington, close the conference, and so cheat them out of the promised tariff autonomy. The conference, when it was not put into abeyance by civil war, was engaged in discussing the higher interim surtaxes, the purposes and conditions thereof, and the abolition of li-kin, while a debt consolidation committee was discussing that subject at meetings which were deemed to be outside the conference. Suddenly the Chinese, having apparently got over their suspicions, brought forward a resolution authorising the immediate levy of the Washington surtaxes. During March a sub-committee held six long meetings to try and settle the terms of this resolution, but utterly failed to come to any agreement. The rock on which they split was &apos;1 purposes and conditions.&apos;&apos; It was admitted by everybody that &apos;&apos; purposes and conditions &apos;&apos; for the Washington surtaxes (estimated to produce 36 million dollars a year) must necessarily be the same as for the interim surtaxes (estimated to produce 90 million dollars a year). These purposes and conditions had not yet been settled by the conference, and therefore, said the Japanese delegate, you cannot begin levying the Washington surtaxes until they have been settled. The Chinese delegate wanted to begin the levy anyway, and agree on purposes and conditions later. Finally, at the sixth (and last) meeting he proposed that levy of the Washington surtaxes should begin with the understanding that, if purposes and conditions had not yet been agreed upon, one-third of the proceeds should be devoted to li-kin abolition, one-third to debt consolidation, and one-third to administrative expenses.   This was refused.
The reason underlying this refusal was that the foreign delegations intended to insist that the &apos;&apos; conditions &apos;&apos; should include rigid foreign control over the whole revenue, and that the main &apos;&apos; purpose&apos;&apos; should be consolidation of the unsecured debt, which would thus be included in the treaty presented to China for her acceptance. In the eyes of the foreign delegations, &apos;&apos; conditions &apos;&apos; were, in fact, synonymous with &quot;debt consolidation.&quot;VII.Thus, everything centered round the question of &quot; conditions.&quot; Up to the grant of tariff autonomy and up to the moment when it became clear that the Chinese themselves would not consent to a debt consolidation scheme being imposed upon them by the conference, our policy was to concentrate upon a constructive li-kin abolition scheme which we hoped would be accepted (1) by China, and (2) by the Powers in return for our support to a debt consolidation scheme. The other Powers (especially America and Japan) concentrated their attention almost exclusively on debt consolidation so as to get their own debt secured. While they had little faith in the li-kin abolition scheme (and it is to be feared that it is, in fact, a visionary and impracticable scheme), they were prepared to accept it, and so was China. But, and here came the crux of the whole situation, the other Powers were determined that a debt consolidation scheme, with complete foreign control over China customs revenues, should be made a sine qua non before even the Washington surtaxes were granted.VIII.Desirable as conditions or guarantees of a constructive character may be in themselves, and sound though it may have been at the time, and in the atmosphere of the Washington Conference five years ago, to make it an essential object of our policy to secure such conditions, the altered circumstances seemed to make it clear that it would be dangerous to endeavour to insist on them now. Quite clearly we ought not to associate ourselves with any attempt to impose upon China a debt consolidation scheme as a condition precedent to the granting of either the Washington or the interim surtaxes. In the case of China we cannot escape from the difficulty that a &quot; condition &apos;&apos; always presupposes some form of foreign control over the revenue. Therefore, it was also clear that if we took up the stand that wts cannot impose upon China &quot; conditions &quot;for the purpose of debt consolidation, we could not attempt to insist upon conditions for any other purpose. It seemed to us. that the right line to take up was to say that we would agree to any proposal that might be acepted by China and the Powers, but that we would not associate ourselves with any attempt to impose it as a condition.IX.In April the Kuo Min-chun (Nationalist army) was driven out of Peking, the Chinese delegation melted away and the conference went into abeyance. Negotia-tions were continued between the foreign delegations with a view to arriving at agreement among themselves in the absence of a Chinese delegation on the subject of debt consolidation and the terms of a resolution authorising the levy of the Washington surtaxes.X.The British delegation had by now come round to the Foreign Office view as      / regards debt consolidation, though they still clung to &quot; conditions &quot; in regard to the-    / Washington surtaxes on the ground that China was not yet fit for complete liberty in tariff matters.   Accordingly, in the course of the negotiations referred to in   J paragraph 9, Sir P. Macleay stated that his instructions would not permit him to&apos; participate in elaborating a joint statement to be tabled at the conference, which formulated a precise or concrete debt consolidation plan, and thus appearing to-force such a plan upon the Chinese.   In the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government it was for the Chinese to draw up their own scheme for dealing with their debts and submit it to the conference.  He had, of course, no objection to the American or any other delegation suggesting a consolidating scheme to the Chinese, which the latter&apos; [15319] is 2
would be free to accept or reject. This declaration, together with other circum-stances, apparently gave rise to reports that His Majesty&apos;s Government were endeavouring to break up the Tariff Conference. On the 8th May, the United States Charge d&apos;Affaires delivered to the Foreign Office a message from his Government to the effect that the United States delegation had reported that the British delegation appeared reluctant to continue further negotiations at Peking; that the United States delegation considered that such an adjournment would be extremely dangerous; that the Japanese delegation were already authorised to continue negotiations, even without British collaboration, for implementing the Washington Treaty and for concluding a treaty providing for the interim surtaxes; that the French and Netherland Ministers also personally favoured such action; and that the United States delegation accordingly proposed to proceed with the conference so far as political conditions would permit, despite the refusal of other foreign delegations to participate. The United States Government considered that the Powers should exhaust every effort to fulfil the promises made to the Chinese Government at Washington and sincerely hoped His Majesty&apos;s Government would be able to continue their co-operation and to conclude the task begun last October.XI.On the 28th May a memorandum was handed to the United States Embassy (see Annex I), in which it was explained that His Majesty&apos;s Government regarded it as a matter of vital importance that the promises made at Washington in 1921 in regard to the grant of customs surtaxes should be implemented without delay, and that the fulfilment of these promises should not be subordinated to the imposition upon China of a scheme for the consolidation of her unsecured debt and extension of foreign control over her customs revenues.XII.With regard to the Washington surtaxes, the course of events subsequent to the disappearance of the Chinese delegation is fully detailed in the memorandum of the 19th July, last paragraph on p. 3 to the end (CP. 308 (26), Annex I).XIII.The memorandum of the 30th July, 1926 (CP. 308 (26)), in considering our future policy, lays emphasis on the fact that, &quot; Our first step must be to implement the Washington promises, and we are now endeavouring, in anticipation of the reopening of the conference, to find some certain means of granting these surtaxes which the other Powers, following our lead, will find themselves unable to reject.&quot; The plan we had in mind was to accept the assurances already given by the Chinese delegation as to the use that would be made of the proceeds of the surtaxes and to propose that the conference should forthwith authorise their levy without further insisting on conditions, purposes or guarantees. The&apos;effect of this would be that the new revenues would not be subject to the Custodian Bank Agreement of 1912, so that, if Canton or any other semi-independent regional Government laid claim to the proceeds, the Inspector-General could yield to force majeure and hand them over to the local authorities without coming into collision either with the Central Govern-ment or the foreign Powers (see CP. 308 (26), Annex I, bottom of p. 5).XIV.In view of the conditions prevailing in Canton, the policy of Washington surtaxes without conditions was tantamount to an offer to Canton of the proceeds of these surtaxes. One of the arguments in support of the policy was the belief, long cherished by the Foreign Office, that such an offer might prove sufficient inducement to Canton to call off the existing anti-British boycott which had been rigidly maintained at that port since June 1925, and that by allowing the Canton Government a share in the customs revenue we might encourage them to foster the trade which produced those revenues, instead of damaging it by further boycotts in the future. (For negotiations and subsequent developments in regard to the Canton boycott, see Annex II.)
XVII.The reasons which prompted the Foreign Office to acquiesce in the new Canton taxes, in spite of their illegality, were as follows : The Powers had promised China certain tariff   increases  (known  as  the Washington surtaxes) nearly five years ago, but their delegates assembled in the Tariff Conference at Peking had failed to implement these promises, because the Powers were determined that the increases should be granted only upon conditions which guaranteed that the greater part of the proceeds would be applied towards the liquidation of their own debts.   The Foreign Office had all along wished to grant these surtaxes without conditions, but had failed to carry this policy into effect, /partly owing to the greed of the other Powers and partly owing to the opposition 0 of our own delegation, who thought that China was not yet fit for such an access of liberty in tariff matters.   The Foreign Office had also wished to offer the proceeds of the surtaxes to Canton as an inducement to call off the boycott, but had not succeeded in finding any method of making this experiment.    There seems no prospect of the Tariff Conference meeting again, owing (1) to the disunion in China, and (2) to the growing demand for complete tariff autonomy, So that it is very improbable that the surtaxes will ever be granted by any process of negotiation with a central Government.   When, therefore, Canton proceeded to help herself to     i the surtaxes, without negotiation, the Foreign Office did not feel that it would be     j either just or politic to raise any serious objection.   Canton was, in fact, carrying    / into effect the policy long pressed by the Foreign Office, and Sir R. Macleay, who    / had hitherto opposed this policy, was now converted to our view, and agreed that   .t the right course was to acquiesce.    The development at Canton seemed to be a proof that the Foreign Office policy had been fundamentally right from the beginning.XVIII.Having decided to acquiesce in the new taxes our chief anxiety was now to ensure that they should be collected by the Maritime Customs, for it was feared *t ,X v &quot;V-x* organisation were set up to collect what were in effect customs duties it might seriously undermine and endanger the Maritime Customs Administration.On the 18th September, Mr. Eugene Chen, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs at Canton, wrote to His- Majesty&apos;s acting consul-general stating- that the boycott would be ended on or before the 10th October, and that the proper Chinese authorities would levy a special consumption tax of 1\ per cent, on ordinary imports and 5 per cent, on imported luxuries, together with a special production tax of 2% per cent, on exports. It was proposed to calculate the new rate on customs memoranda and to arrange for Customs authorities to clear papers only on production of vouchers verifying payment of such new special taxes. Mr. Chen further explained to His Majesty&apos;s consul-general that these taxes would be levied on goods of all nationalities, with no discrimination against the British. The British authorities were not asked for formal agreement or for assistance with the Customs; they were only asked not to raise objections.XVI.After consultation with Sir R. Macleay, Mr. Brenan was instructed to send a mere formal acknowledgment of the letter of the 18th September notifying imposition of the new taxes, and it was decided to adopt the policy of tacitly acquiescing in the levy of the taxes, and endeavouring to secure (1) that they should be levied by the Customs ; (2) that the position should be regularised-not merely in Canton, but also in other centres which might put forward similar claims by ex post facto negotia-tions. As the Cantonese had themselves expressed a desire for Customs assistance, we decided to adopt a merely passive attitude and wait for the situation to develop. We decided to make no communication to the Powers, but, if approached by them, to reply that we were waiting to see whether the Canton Government were making genuine efforts to bring the boycott to an end; if so, we would probably be disposed to acquiesce in the new taxation (see our telegram to Peking, No. 277).
The chief difficulty in this connection was that the Customs could not collect such a tax unless it had been agreed to, formally or informally, by the Treaty Powers or unless it was a case of force majeure. That is to say, the Customs could collect the tax if the Inspector-General could maintain that, only by obeying the order of the local authorities could he hope to save the Customs Administration from destruction. Such a situation, however, did not arise, and there was nothing for it, therefore, but to await developments.On the 8th October a Diplomatic Body meeting was held to consider the new taxes, and the Ministers of the other Powers were all in favour of making a joint protest. His Majesty&apos;s consul-general at Canton pointed out that a protest not i backed by force would be entirely ineffective, and would merely tie the hands of the \ Powers in regard to securing collection by the Maritime Customs. We felt that it would be a great mistake for the Powers to register a united protest, and Sir R. Macleay was instructed to do his utmost to dissuade his colleagues from this-course. If, however, they persisted, we thought it better not to refuse to take part in a joint diplomatic protest, however ineffective it might be; but we felt that everything was to be gained by delay as time was working on our side. Sir R. Macleay was therefore instructed to ascertain from his colleagues what effect they expected a protest to have, and, in the probable event of its being ignored, whether they were prepared to back it up in any way and, if so, what action they were prepared to take to that end.A further meeting of the Diplomatic Body was held on the 20th October, and Sir R. Macleay reported that his colleagues realised that a protest would be ineffective and that their Governments would not take any action to support it. They seemed impressed with the argument that every effort should be made to prevent the estab-lishment of a rival organisation that might prove a menace to the Maritime Customs Administration, and they received favourably a suggestion that the Powers might accept the new taxes on receiving guarantees that they would be levied in lieu of li-kin. Nevertheless, they considered that a protest should be made in order to safeguard the important principle at stake.The way now seemed clear for united action. It seemed that the Powers were ready to join with us in our endeavours to secure collection by the Customs and subsequent regularisation, while we, for our part, were prepared to join in a suitably worded protest, or, preferably, a statement reserving our treaty rights.A further telegram from Sir R. Macleay, however, dated just a week later (Peking telegram No.  392 of the 27th October), conveyed the disappointing intelligence that the United States Government was definitely opposed to collection / by the Customs, and that the Japanese Government took much the same view.   There I was no prospect of joint action, and Sir R. Macleay considered that we must either I act alone or seek unity of action by conferring with the American and Japanese Governments.   This, however, would involve indefinite delay during which time the rival organisation would get firmly established and it might be too late to save the Customs.  Before definitely recommending isolated action Sir R. Macleay wished to receive further information as to the prospects of our being able at this late hour to induce the Cantonese to entrust the entire collection to the Maritime Customs.The danger now seemed very pressing. The separate organisation for the collection of the new taxes had been successfully set up on the 11th October, and was getting well established and gaining confidence. The Canton Government had also established an inspection corps for the examination of all goods and passengers &quot; for the protection of revenue and prevention of illegal or enemy activity.&quot;XIX.XX.XXI.XXII.
XXIII.Our instructions to Mr. Brenan were that we were anxious to convince the Cantonese that we would sympathetically consider any reasonable proposals in this as in other matters, even if contrary to strict treaty rights, in exchange for fair and considerate treatment of British interests by them, and at the same time to persuade them that if they were unreasonable this would only create friction and so impede the achievement of their own projects. We were prepared to acquiesce in the stationing of inspectors on British wharves (it seemed that the immunity hitherto successfully claimed was the kind of privilege that we must be prepared gradually to relinquish in future), but we would only acquiesce in searches of British ships if this were done in collaboration with or under the direction of the Maritime Customs.XXIV.We further suggested to Sir R. Macleay that it seemed impossible to defer any longer taking such action as might be open to us to avert the growing danger to the Maritime Customs, and we outlined the following policy for his consideration : &apos;He should explain fully to his colleagues that we acquiesced in these taxes on the ground that tariff increases had been promised to China five years ago and not granted, that our main objective, therefore, was to secure collection by the Customs so as to save the Customs Administration, but that it might be possible to make some arrangement for liquidating the unsecured debt out of the existing customs revenues which were subject to the Custodian Bank Agreement of 1912. If his colleagues did not concur in this policy we would still join in the protest they desired to make provided it were so worded as not to prevent us pursuing our own policy single-handed. We would then issue a statement explaining our policy and reserving our treaty rights in the following terms : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government have had under consideration the action of the local authorities at Canton in levying certain taxes styled Production and Consumption Taxes on the foreign trade of the port. Such taxes are not sanctioned by any of the treaties between China and the foreign Powers. They cannot, therefore, legally be levied except with the assent of the Treaty Power or Powers concerned. His Majesty:s Government have, however, taken into consideration the fact that tariff increases were promised to China five years ago and that circumstances have prevented the implementing of these promises. As the abnormal conditions now prevailing in China may operate still further to delay the negotiation of tariff increases, His Majesty&apos;s Government do not propose to resist the levy of these taxes, and, provided that arrangements are made, in so far as British merchants and British goods are concerned, to entrust the levy of the taxes to the Maritime Customs Administration, His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to instruct their nationals to acquiesce in. and do their utmost to facilitate the collection of the taxes. This acquiescence, however, must not be construed as signifying any diminution of the rights conferred or the obligations imposed by the treaties now in force between China and Great Britain. His Majesty&apos;s Government have adopted this conciliatory attitude from a desire to assist China through the difficulties of a period of transition and in the expectation that the Chinese authorities will respond to the friendly feeling thus shown and find some means to regularise the position.&apos;-&apos;XXV.In his reply of the 1st November it appeared that Sir R. Macleay had changed his mind. He now suggested that we should join in a pro forma protest, without making the explanations of our policy or issuing the separate statement quoted in paragraph XXIV, and that we should inform the Canton Government that we would acquiesce on condition that the collection of the taxes would be entrusted to the inspectors were stationed on British wharves, contrary to extra-territorial rights as hitherto interpreted, and proposed to board and search all incoming steamers. It seemed as if a deliberate attempt were being made to usurp the functions and undermine the authority of the Maritime Customs.
Customs Administration. He anticipated that the Cantonese would refuse (in which case presumably our acquiescence would also fall to the ground). He did not suggest what our next step should be, but it appeared that he was not really in favour of acquiescence at all, but would prefer that we should join in an emphatic protest and attempt to unite the Powers in a joint stand in defence of their treaty rights. In this connection, it should be noted that in a previous telegram Sir R. Macleay had informed us that, in view of the tame acquiescence of the Powers in the illegal exactions of the Strike Committee and in irregular taxes, such as the Canton oil tax, it was unlikely that they would proceed beyond paper protests. This anticipation was fully confirmed at a Diplomatic Body meeting of the 20th October, when Sir R. Macleay reported that his colleagues did not think that the proposed protest would be effective in stopping the Cantonese levying the taxes or that their Governments would join in any action to enforce it.XXVI.Cn the 3rd November Sir R. Macleay, misunderstanding his instructions, agreed to participate in a joint protest, but without making any explanation to the Powers as to our policy as set forth in paragraph XXIV above. This has made it impossible to proceed with that policy on the lines originally intended.J. T. PRATT.Foreign Office, November 4, 1926.[f 1998/8/10] Annex I.Memorandum communicated to United States Embassy, May 28, 1926.HIS Majesty&apos;s Government have received through the United States Embassy in London a message from the United States Government enquiring whether His Majesty&apos;s Government endorse the attitude ascribed to the British delegation at Peking of desiring to abandon the negotiations at Peking and break up the Tariff Conference ; and expressing the hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government will continue to co-operate with the other interested Powers in bringing to a conclusion the task which was begun last October.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to assure the United States Government that the report received by them that the British delegation desire to withdraw from the negotiations at Peking appears to be based on a complete misunderstanding. His Majesty&apos;s Government have no intention whatever of breaking up the Tariff Conference. It is true that the question has been considered whether at the present juncture it might not be convenient to arrange a brief suspension of the conference over the summer months. It was realised, however, that in existing circumstances suspension of the conference might prove to be more prolonged than was intended, and in order to prevent the possibility of misunderstanding as to the sincerity of the Powers, His Majesty&apos;s Government considered it to be of the greatest importance that, before even such a brief suspension as above contemplated took place, there must first be a complete liquidation of the promises made at Washington.3. The British delegation in Peking fully shared this view, and appreciated the prime necessity of liquidating the Washington Treaty. A considerable interchange of views has, however, taken place between the Foreign Office and the delegation in regard to the proceedings of the conference on the subject of the unsecured debt; and it is probable that the misunderstanding to which reference is made above has arisen in consequence of the attitude which the delegation has been instructed to take on this matter, and which was formally stated by the chief British delegate at the meeting at the Netherlands Legation on the 6th May.4. The United States Government will no doubt recollect that His Majestys Government were from the first averse to the imposition on the Chinese Government of any scheme of consolidation of the unsecured debt as part of the work of the Tariff Conference, and that they only agreed later and with great reluctance to the discussion of any such scheme at the conference, If the schemes of the foreign delegations for the consolidation of the unsecured debt should postulate too strict a control over China&apos;s customs revenues (shortly to be increased by tariff autonomy) His Majesty&apos;s Government are afraid that a dangerous deadlock may arise, for the discussions on this
[F 4326/1/10] Annex II.The Canton Boycott.A Record of Events (July 15, ld2Q-October 13, 1926).THE following memorandum is a continuation of Mr. Ashton-Gwatkin&apos;s memorandum respecting Canton of the 3rd February, 1926 (Confidential, 121)06), and of Mr. Patrick&apos;s memorandum of the 13th July, 1926, on the Hong Kong-Canton negotiations (July 13, 1926, Section 1).2. Negotiations for the settlement of the anti-British boycott in the Kwangtung Province and of other cognate questions opened on the 15th July between the Canton delegation, consisting of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Labour, and the Hong Kong delegation, of which His Majesty&apos;s acting consul-general at Canton, Mr. J. F. Brenan, was a member. The proceedings opened with an interchange of formal courtesies, and on the following day the Cantonese delegation produced a long written statement giving their views on the origin of the boycott, and asked for a reply from the British side, with a view to publication. This reply was provided, with an expression of hope that the Chinese delegation would abandon such methods of public controversy and settle down to serious negotiations. In private conversation, Mr. Chen, the Cantonese Foreign Minister, urged upon Mr. Brenan that the Hong Kong Government should help the [15319] csubject show that the Chinese, though willing to bind themselves to devote a proportion of their revenues to the unsecured debt, have declined to allow the details of debt consolidation to be dealt with by the Tariff Conference, and will refuse to submit to any extension of foreign control for that or any other purpose over China&apos;s customs revenues.5. His Majesty&apos;s Government, after full consideration and prolonged consultation with their delegation in Peking, have come to the conclusion that, while they are ready to agree to any reasonable scheme for dealing with the unsecured debt put forward by the Chinese and agreed to by the other Powers, it would not be right to associate themselves with any attempt to force upon the Chinese a greater degree of foreign control over the revenues required for that purpose than they are prepared voluntarily to concede. A policy involving increase of foreign control, and capable of being regarded as an encroachment on that sovereignty and independence of China which the Powers agreed at Washington to respect, is so fundamentally opposed to the traditional policy of the United States towards China that His Majesty&apos;s Government are disposed to believe that the State Department will share their anxiety on this subject.6. It is true that His Majesty&apos;s Government originally desired to exact proper guarantees from China in regard to the abolition of li-kin as a condition precedent to the grant of the Washington surtaxes, but they have come to the conclusion that, in the altered circumstances and changed atmosphere of to-day, any attempt to insist upon guarantees against the will of the Chinese Government would only result in postponing indefinitely the liquidation of the Washington promises. They are as anxious as the United States Government fully to implement these promises at the earliest possible moment, and believe that it would be contrary to the intentions of both Governments, both at and subsequent to the Washington Conference, to subordinate the fulfilment of these promises to the imposition upon China of a scheme for the consolidation of her unsecured debt and extension of foreign control over her customs revenues. Any failure to implement the Washington Treaty might create a very dangerous situation, and His Majesty&apos;s Government now therefore hold the view that if any reasonably satisfactory assurances are given by the Chinese Government as to the use which it proposes to make of the new revenues the Powers should accept such assurances, abstain from any attempt to impose control or exact guarantees, and forthwith authorise the levy of the surtaxes. They feel confident that a policy, so closely in accord with the friendship and generosity always displayed by the United States of America towards the people of China, will receive the full and cordial support of the United States Government.Foreign Office, May 28, 1926.
Cantonese Government with money, in order to get rid of the 40,000 persons who were unemployed and living on the Government dole. Mr. Brenan replied that Hong Kong would not pay a cent for this purpose, since it would be regarded as blackmail, but that, in order to enable the Canton Government to show their people that they had got something out of the settlement, Hong Kong would lend money for the development of the province. Mr. Brenan mentioned their willingness to make a properly secured loan for the construction of the Whampoa port, together with a railway loop round Canton City, if the amount were within reasonable limits. Mr. Chen appeared impressed with this idea.3. At a meeting on the 21st July the Cantonese Minister for Foreign Affairs made the following verbal proposal for a settlement: (a.) The Shameen Incident. Guarantees to be afforded against the repetition of such incidents, involving the regulation of Shameen defence measures and use of gunboats.   Compensation to be paid in respect of the victims.(b.) Boycott.- Hong Kong to assist Canton financially as regards the unemploy-ment question that is to say, to pay compensation to the strikers.4. The second demand was definitely refused. As regards the first, the British delegates replied that no change could be made in the defence measures until the safety of foreign residents was adequately guaranteed. As for compensation, they maintained that the Chinese were responsible for the incident, and pointed out that on the British side also there were heavy claims for damage and loss, but that they were willing to leave these questions for subsequent adjustment. They then proposed a development loan as means for an immediate settlement, mentioning the Whampoa port scheme and a project for a loop railway line, provided that this did not cost more than about 10 million dollars. In reply, the Cantonese delegates reiterated that their Government could not terminate the boycott without the expenditure of money, and that the boycott was the direct outcome of the Shameen incident; so that, if the British could not accept responsibility for the shooting, this responsibility should be fixed by international enquiry. The British delegates pointed out the difficulties with regard to such an enquiry, but agreed to refer the proposal to His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Cantonese delegates, for their part, said that they would refer the loan proposal to their Government, and the conference was adjourned on the 25th July.5. Mr. Brenan considered that the Cantonese Government were not willing to settle without a cash payment and had adopted the idea of an enquiry in order to suspend negotiations. Another possible explanation was that they might be playing for delay owing to their recent military success in Hunan, in the hope that they might soon establish themselves on the Yang-tsze and increase their influence throughout China, and so be in a much stronger position for negotiation.6. Nevertheless, His Majesty&apos;s Government gave careful consideration to the proposal for an enquiry. They thought it would be a mistake in tactics entirely to reject it, and that the Cantonese Government should be informed that they would take part in the enquiry on the following conditions : (a.) The boycott to be first removed.(b.) The French Government to participate (the French own a part of the Shameen Concession and have troops stationed there who took part in the firing).(c.) Adequate precautions to be taken for complete impartiality. (d.) The presiding judge to be a national of a Power not represented at Canton. (e.) Full facilities to be given by foreign Governments to enable their nationals to give evidence.(/.) The enquiry to be confined solely to ascertaining all the facts of the Shameen incident, and to be conducted under terms of reference strictly drawn up for this purpose.7. His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking, His Majesty&apos;s acting consul-general at Canton and the Governor of Hong Kong all concurred in this reply, but it was decided to postpone its delivery to the Cantonese Government until the political and military situation in South China became clear. It was thought possible that the Cantonese northern expedition might fail, and that the Cantonese (Government might in such an event be in a more conciliatory frame of mind.8. The Governor of Hong Kong was anxious that the offer of de jure recognition to the Canton Government might be used as a bargaining counter, but
His Majesty&apos;s Government were unable to agree to this suggestion. Both the Governor of Hong Kong and Mr. Brenan were in favour of attaching further con-ditions to the acceptance of the enquiry proposal, and these were still under consideration when, on the 2nd September, Sir C. Clementi suggested that the proposed reply should now be delivered, and that, if no answer were received from the Cantonese Government within a fortnight, they should be given a further week in which to reply, failing which the British offer of a loan and their reply on the question of the enquiry should be withdrawn. It seemed, however, to His Majesty&apos;s Government that the situation had considerably changed since the reply to the Canton Government was agreed upon. His Majesty&apos;s naval forces had been compelled to take action against the strike pickets in Canton harbour, and the Cantonese northern expedition had been unexpectedly successful. Sir C. Clementi was accordingly asked to review the situation afresh.9. The circumstances in which naval action was taken at Canton were as follows. On the 26th August Mr. Brenan reported that since the suspension of the negotiations the boycott had been effectively tightened up throughout the province; that new pickets were being recruited, armed and drilled; and that the Strike Committee were becoming more truculent. This &quot; organised brigandage &quot; culminated on the 28th August in the opening of fire by the pickets upon a British subject and an American, who were on their way from the Customs Wharf to the Hong Kong steamer. Mr. Brenan urged that reprisals should be taken, and on the 31st August he was informed that orders had been sent to the Commander-in-chief to seize and disable picket boats, in order that these acts of piracy by the picket boats should be prevented. The naval forces were, however, not to become involved in street fighting, and the co-operation of the American naval forces was, if possible, to be secured. All the picket boats used for hostile purposes in pursuance of the boycott were to be seized, and not merely those caught interfering with British subjects. These operations were successfully executed without a shot being fired. No picket boats were seized, because they all made off at the first sign of action, but the harbour was cleared of them and shooting ceased. At the same time strike pickets were driven from British-owned wharves and a gunboat was moored alongside. The boycott examination shed was also cleared and guarded in the same way, and cargo boats were not allowed to approach it. Similar action was taken at Swatow, where one picket boat was seized.10. The French, Japanese and United States Governments had been informed of the action which His Majesty&apos;s Government proposed to take, and as a United States citizen had been involved in the incident of the 28th August the United States Government were asked whether they wished to associate themselves with His Majesty&apos;s Government. The State Department, however, intimated that they would be unable to do so.11. In the meantime, the Cantonese northern expedition had made good progress. They took possession of the Province of Hunan and reached the. Yang-tsze, capturing Hankow (where there are foreign concessions) and Hanyang (where there are ironworks and an important arsenal), and advancing north of the Yang-tsze into the Province of Hupeh. It was feared that the establishment of the Cantonese forces on the Yang-tsze would lead to an extension of the Canton boycott to British trade in the Yang-tsze valley, but though there is some evidence that attempts were made to organise a boycott the movement made no appreciable headway, though there was of course considerable dislocation of trade. There was also some indiscriminate firing by the Cantonese forces upon foreign vessels on the river.12. On the 10th September Mr. Brenan addressed two notes to the Cantonese Government. In one of these, sent on the instructions of His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking, he renuested that immediate orders should be sent to the army commanders on the Yang-tsze to put an end to the firing on British ships. In the other, sent at the request of the Governor of Hong Kong, he enquired, in connection with a recent speech by Sun Fo, who is a member of the Canton Government, whether it was the policy of the Canton Government to support the strikers and to develop the anti-British boycott throughout China, On the 12th September he reported that he had come to an arrangement with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, by which the river and the British wharves would be patrolled by Chinese police, and the pickets them-selves prevented from functioning. In return for this, he agreed that British naval activities should temporarily cease, but that if the undertaking were not carried out liberty of action would be resumed. He further recommended that the negotia-[15319] d
tions for the termination of the boycott, suspended since the end of July, should be reopened.13. On the 13th September the Governor of Hong Kong sent a telegram to the Colonial Office, in which he reviewed the situation in the light of the developments recorded above. In this telegram he stated, among other things, that he regarded the Cantonese undertakings as obviously insincere, and he disagreed with Mr. Brenan&apos;s suggestion for the resumption of negotiations. On the contrary, he considered that the critical situation of the Cantonese forces and the hazardous political conditions in Kwangtung afforded His Majesty&apos;s Government a unique opportunity of bringing about the rapid termination of the boycott by independent warlike action, without running more than a minimum of risk of creating an unfavourable effect either upon foreign Powers or on the situation elsewhere in China. He recommended, therefore, that unless satisfactory replies were received within a few days to the consul-generals two notes of the 10th September we should demand within twenty-four hours an undertaking that all British ships on the Yang-tsze and elsewhere would be respected by Cantonese troops, and that all anti-British manifestations on territory controlled by the Cantonese Government should cease forthwith; failing which we should take such action as might seem to us proper. He considered that the mere threat would suffice, but if it did not he submitted that we should then proceed to close the ports of Canton and Swatow by naval action. Sir R. Macleay concurred in Sir C. Clementi&apos;s recommendations, and at the same time suggested that His Majesty&apos;s Government should consider the desirability of affording moral and material support to Marshal Sun Chuan-fang against the Cantonese forces.14. His Majesty&apos;s Government found themselves unable to agree to these recommendations. It was the considered opinion of the Committee of Imperial Defence in March 1926 that the only practicable measure against Canton would be a blockade; that a blockade would necessitate prior international agreement; and that should such a blockade fail offensive action, in China on a large scale was not possible for the British Empire acting alone, and could only be international. Such international co-operation would be impossible to secure. His Majesty&apos;s Government also considered that to support Marshal Sun Chuan-fang would involve a reversal of their long-standing policy not to identify themselves with any of the conflicting factions in China, and might involve far-reaching and dangerous consequences.15. The whole situation was again reviewed on the 20th September by the three service Departments, who stated that thay were satisfied, that the conclusions arrived at by the Committee of Imperial Defence last March continued to govern the situation, both in China generally and at Canton in particular from their respective points of view. This decision was communicated to Sir R. Macleay and Sir C. Clementi on the same day, and they were at the same time informed that the service Departments were considering what, if any, other measures short of a blockade it would be practicable to take in case of necessity.16. In the meantime, Mr. Brenan reported that he had received fairly satis-factory replies to his two notes of the 10th September and His Majesty&apos;s Government decided not to pursue the matter further. *17. On the 18th September there was an important new development. On that date Mr. Brenan received a note from the Cantonese Government stating that arrangements had been made to end the boycott on or before the 10th October (most probably at the end of September), and that the proper Chinese authorities would levy a special consumption tax of 2^ per cent, on ordinary imports and 5 per cent, on imported luxuries, together with a special production tax of 2\ per cent, on exports. The customs authorities would be asked to assist in the collection of these taxes. It was explained verbally to Mr. Brenan that the proceeds of these taxes would be used to liquidate the boycott organisation, and that the taxes would be levied on goods of all nationalities. His Majesty&apos;s Government were not asked to agree, but simply not to raise objection.18. About the same time Mr. Brenan reported that the pickets had been removed from the Shameen bridges and the approaching termination of the boycott announced in the Canton press; that the arrangements previously reached for non-interference by the pickets on the river continued to be observed; and that Hong-Kong steamers were getting Chinese passengers and deck cargoes. He had some confidence, therefore, that the Cantonese undertakings would be carried out, though it was likely that the agitation against dealing with British goods might continue for some time after the actual raising of the boycott.
19. Sir F. Aglen, the Inspector-General of Customs, who happened to be on leave in this country, was consulted in regard to the Canton taxation proposals. He was, of course, greatly perturbed, and anticipated that if the Powers acquiesced in the levy of these taxes there would be incalculable complications throughout China in regard to tariff and customs problems. His inclination was to refuse to allow the Customs Administration to take any part in the collection of the new taxes unless he were first assured that all the interested Powers were agreeable, but in the last resort he would probably yield to force majeure.20. In the view of the Foreign Office, however, the paramount consideration was the possibility of a termination of the boycott; and the substitution of these relatively moderate taxes for the much more extensive illegalities of the Strike Committee seemed a small price to pay for the resumption of trade between Canton and Hong Kong, provided, of course, that the boycott was actually raised and that anti-British agitation ceased. It however appeared that the Cantonese Govern-ment were carefully distinguishing these proposed taxes from the so-called Washington Surtaxes, to which they are identical in scale, and were insisting that they were to be regarded as purely internal taxes, one of the purposes of which would be to finance the abolition of li-kin. The reasons for this attitude on the part of the Cantonese Government were probably the following :  (1.) That the revenue accruing from an internal tax is incontestably their ownto do as they like with. (2.) That in regard to internal taxation no question as to the rights of theCentral Government can arise. (3.) That they do not desire to concern themselves with the WashingtonSurtaxes or, indeed, with Tariff Conference matters at all until they themselves are recognised as the Central Government. (4.) That even in that event they may, as Nationalists, decline to accept tariffincreases from the Powers.21. In these circumstances, it appeared to the Foreign Office that the wisest policy would be to adopt a passive attitude and to wait and see whether the boycott was actually raised before coming to a definite opinion in regard to the levy of the hew taxes. Mr. Brenan was accordingly instructed to reply to the Cantonese note of the 18th September by a formal acknowledgment in which he would welcome the assurance given to terminate the boycott on or before the 10th October, but to make no reference whatever to the taxation proposals. He was at the same time given discretion to intimate verbally that the acquiescence of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the levy of the new taxes would be dependent upon the taxation being levied, on goods of all nationalities and upon the effective calling off of the boycott; that if the Cantonese collected these taxes with the assistance of the Customs the position should be regularised by subsequent negotiations; and that if the Powers acquiesced in the levy of these taxes they would probably be forced to admit similar claims on the part of other local authorities in China, and indeed perhaps to recognise frankly that these taxes were, in effect, the Washington Surtaxes, to which they accurately corresponded in scale.22. On the 1st October Mr. Brenan reported that he had formally acknowledged the note of the 18th September, but that he had not so far given the verbal explana-tions described above. He stated that the pickets were gradually being withdrawn, but that he was a little apprehensive lest anti-British agitation should nevertheless persist and make the full resumption of trade impossible. He had therefore con-fmed himself to informing the Minister for Foreign Affairs that, in his personal opinion, the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the new taxation proposals would be dependent upon the extent to which the Cantonese Government curbed this agitation, and he called upon them to issue a proclamation promising protection to those who dealt in British goods. He proposed to defer committing His Majesty&apos;s Government any further until he saw how the situation developed.23. Meanwhile, Sir R. Macleay reported that his foreign colleagues had shown great anxiety- to learn what attitude His Majesty&apos;s Government were adopting towards the taxation proposals, and enquired what answer he should give them. He wras told to reply that His Majesty&apos;s Government desired first to be assured that the Cantonese Government really intended to bring the boycott to an end, and that if they found that the boycott was raised they would probably be disposed to-acquiesce in the new levies, but that they would require much fuller information than they then possessed in regard to the Cantonese proposals before they could come to a final decision.[15319]
24. A memorandum by Mr. Pratt on the position of the Customs Administration in regard to the new taxation proposals is annexed.*25. The possibility of taking other measures at Canton short of a blockade in the event of the Cantonese Government having failed to carry out their assurances on the 10th October was carefully considered by the Departments concerned at a meeting on the 4th October, and they had in particular under examination the proposal of the Commodore at Hong Kong, which was to contain Chinese cargo junks ip a state of inactivity under threat of seizure, an essential feature of his plan being that Shameen should not be evacuated. This plan was found to be open to the following grave objections : (a.) No guarantee could be given by the naval authorities that the militaryforces which would have to be sent to garrison Shameen could in caseof necessity be safely withdrawn. (b.) The proposal entailed in the last resort a willingness to bomb or bombardCanton, i.e., as the only possible answer to a Cantonese attack on theShameen garrison.(c.) In default of willingness to resort to this measure the plan was in the nature of bluff.(d.) There was no sufficient guarantee that the plan would prove efficacious.26. It was therefore the unanimous opinion of the naval and military experts that, given the non-evacuation of Shameen as an essential premise, no effective action could be taken on the 11th October beyond the preventive measures against pickets which had already been adopted, together with a show of force in Canton harbour. It was decided, therefore, that unless the Governor or Mr. Brenan could suggest any fresh measures it would be necessary to leave Mr. Brenan to continue the efforts he had already made to get the boycott removed on whatever lines he thought best, subject to the instructions he had already received. A telegram to this effect was sent to Sir R. Macleay and to Sir C. Clementi on the 7th October.27. On the 9th October Mr. Brenan reported that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had communicated to all the foreign consuls the text of a mandate introducing the new taxes. According to the terms of this mandate the internal taxes were to be levied on consumption or production of articles of trade between the two provinces of Kwangtung and Kwangsi on the one hand and other provinces of China and foreign countries on the other. The rate was to be half the maritime or native customs tariff on general articles and the full tariff on articles of luxury such as silk, toilet articles, fur and leather articles, decorations, precious stones, &amp;c. Tobacco, imported wines, kerosene and gasoline, being subject to other special taxes, were to be exempt from this new taxation. The taxes were to be collected at or near the customs barrier.   The mandate was to come into effect on the 11th October.28. The note transmitting this mandate emphasised that the new taxes were internal taxes and that the Canton Government had no intention of interfering with the maritime customs, though friction would be avoided if the Customs would co-operate in the collection of the new taxes by the fiscal authorities appointed by the new Government.      . .29. Mr. Brenan did not send any written acknowledgment to this note, but told the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the taxes were a clear violation of existing treaties, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government were waiting to see the extent to which the boycott would be removed before indicating their attitude in the matter.30. On the instructions of the Acting Inspector-General of Customs at Peking, the Commissioner of Customs informed the Cantonese Government that the customs administration would be unable to assist in the collection of the new taxes without the acquiescence of the Powers.31. Mr. Brenan reported at the same time that there had been no recent change in the boycott situation beyond a slight slackening in picket activity. Anti-British agitation still continued; but the Minister for Foreign Affairs had emphatically assured him that the boycott would be publicly declared at an end at noon on the 10th October. Mr. Chen also promised to deal with any cases of intimidation of British employees which might be brought to his notice.32. The question of the new taxation was discussed by the diplomatic body in Peking on the 7th and 8th October. Sir R. Macleay reported that the unanimous view of his colleagues was that the taxes were a clear violation of treaties and that the proposed action of the Cantonese Government raised very grave issues.   It was* Annex lit.
thought that tacit acquiescence might lead to eventual provincial or regional tariff autonomy, and that separate negotiations with the Canton Government with the object of regularising the situation would amount in practice to the recognition of their independence. They considered that a joint protest should be lodged, but Sir R. Macleay made it clear that, in view of his instructions, he could not join in any such protest without further reference to his Government. A draft protest for presentation to the Peking Government was, however, prepared and telegraphed by the foreign representatives to their Governments. In the course of the discussion upon this draft it became clear that the Japanese Government would oppose any attempt to identify the new taxation with the Washington surtaxes, the true, if unavowed, reason for their objection being that such identification would imply a readiness on the part of the Powers to grant the Washington surtaxes uncon-ditionally. This would, of course, render impossible the devotion of the proceeds to debt consolidation, a point to which the Japanese attach the highest importance.33. Some of the foreign representatives decided to protest individually through their consuls at Canton without waiting for an agreement upon a joint protest.34. On the 13th October Mr. Brenan sent two telegrams, in which he reviewed the situation up to that date.   The substance of these telegrams is as follows : (1.) The promised declaration of the termination of the boycott and blockade was issued on the 10th October, not by the Canton Government itself, but by the Strike Committee and the Central Executive Committee of the Kuo Min-tang. The declaration, however, added that an intensive anti-imperialist struggle would be continued on a national scale until the independence of China was completely secured.(2.) Pickets were no longer functioning and the stike examination shed had been dismantled. Chinese were coming back to Shameen in large numbers and British firms were getting back most of their native staffs. No cases of intimidation had been reported.(3.) The strike and blockade were over, but it was still uncertain to what extent the agitation against British trade would prove effective. Chinese merchants were hesitating to resume shipment to Hong Kong, but it was hoped that a start would soon be made.(4.) The Canton Government had opened a tax office near the Customs and were levying the 2\ per cent. duty. They were not yet collecting the 5 per cent, duty, owing to technical difficulties.(5.) No protests against the taxation had yet been made by the foreign consuls. In fact, the consular body, the foreign chambers of commerce and the Commissioner of Customs were all of opinion that the tax, if levied at all, should be collected by the Customs, otherwise the Government would set up an organisation of their own composed of officials who would merely be strike pickets in disguise.(6.) His own opinion was that, if the Powers protested against the taxes without backing their protest up by force, they would merely be encouraging the establishment of a separate customs organisation, and this would jeopardise the existence of the maritime customs organisation.35. It remains to record two demarches made by the Peking Government in regard to the relations between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of Canton. Early in August the Peking Government became alarmed at the possibility that His Majesty&apos;s Government might recognise the Canton Government, and made an official enquiry as to our intentions. They were informed that no question had arisen of recognising the Canton Administration as other than the Provincial Government of Kwangtung. A few days later a note was received from the Chinese Government, expressing the hope that no funds would be provided directly or indirectly to the Canton Administration so as to enable them to prolong the struggle -against the Central Government and thus delay the reunification of China. His Majesty&apos;s Government replied that they had no intention of furnishing Canton with funds for military purposes, but that they must be guided by the circumstances of the situation as to the means which could best be adopted for a settlement of the anti-British boycott in South China.W. STRANG.Foreign Office, October 13, 1926.
&quot;[f 4132/1/10]   : Annex III.The Customs Administration anal the New Taxation Proposals at Canton.THE Canton Government propose to levy consumption taxes and production taxes on all imports into and exports out of Canton. These taxes have been levied all over China for many years past. We have fought them with very little success. A formal protest is sometimes registered, but in many cases, the goods being in the hands of Chinese, the foreign merchant is ignorant of the taxation which they are subjected to. The peculiar feature of the present taxes is that the Cantonese propose to levy them with the assistance of the Maritime Customs, who, if they accede to the request of the Canton Government, will refuse to clear cargo through the customs inward or outward without production of a voucher showing that the taxes have been paid. This will relieve Canton of all cost of collection, will make them much more productive and much less onerous to the merchant, but it will also make them practically a surtax on customs revenues, and, moreover, a surtax which, by some-thing more than a coincidence, is (apart from exports) fixed at the same figure as the Washington surtaxes. Cases have occurred in the past where the customs have refused to grant facilities except on proof of payment of some inland extra treaty tax, but not on a scale comparable to the present proposal.The position of the Customs Administration is one of great difficulty. Sir Francis Aglen may take up the line that these taxes are not authorised by treaty and refuse to collect them. He, however, is the servant of the Chinese Government, and not of the Powers or the Diplomatic Body, and though he must, very rightly, do his best to induce the Chinese to observe their treaty obligations, in the last resort it is not his function to interfere in a treaty dispute between China and the Powers, and he must either obey the orders of the Chinese Government, or resign, or be dismissed. He may refuse to collect the taxes because the order of the Canton Government is not endorsed by the Central Government, whose servant he really is. But the Customs Administration at each port depends very largely on the goodwill of the local administration, and especially at Canton it cannot afford to antagonise the de facto Government within whose jurisdiction it functions.There is at present no indication of any desire to attack the Customs Administration. On the contrary, there is a welcome tendency to respect its authority. But, in view of the recent history of the customs question at Canton, w*e are skating over thin ice. Between 1918 and 1924 the Powers staged five naval demonstrations at Canton because Canton objected to the use being made of China&apos;s customs revenues and demanded her share of her own revenues after the secured foreign obligations had been met. She specifically objected to the domestic loans raised by Peking at ruinous rates for nefarious purposes. Sir Francis Aglen had undertaken the service of these loans out of surplus customs revenues, and the effect of the naval demonstrations by the Powers was to ensure that these surplus revenues should not be seized by Canton, but should continue to be remitted to Sir Francis Aglen&apos;s account at Shanghai, there to be used by him for the service of the domestic loans.It is now recognised that the policy of the naval demonstrations was a mistake. Fortunately, the Cantonese have not again raised the question of surplus revenues. They are content to leave the present revenues and the system of handling them alone, but, in effect,, they want to increase the customs revenues in such a way that the increase will not come under the control of Sir Francis Aglen, but will be paid direct into the coffers of the local Government.It is perhaps Sir Francis Aglen&apos;s greatest pride that he has acquired control over the whole customs revenue. If Canton succeed, future customs revenues will not be under his control, and, in judging his attitude towards the new proposals, the personal equation must be taken into account. There are, however, more solid reasons than Sir Francis Aglen&apos;s personal feelings for scrutinising very carefully the new situation that has been created by Canton&apos;s demarche. If Canton collects these new taxes with the aid of the customs, then 1. Every other regional Government may in a short time do the same.2. We shall hear no more of the &quot;grant&quot; of tariff increases by the Powers. The Chinese will not want to increase the tariff after they have discovered this method of collecting what are, in fact, increased customs duties.3. This will eventually be equivalent to tariff autonomy.
There will be a danger that surtaxes at different rates will be imposed in different centres. That is to say, there may be a different tariff at each port.There seems now no disposition anywhere to attack the present method of handling existing customs revenues the proceeds of the 5 per cent, flat rate but additional revenues will not be under any sort of foreign control.The result of 5 will be that debt consolidation will be rendered impossible, but, on the other hand, it might be possible to arrange to pay off China&apos;s debts out of the existing customs revenues after the present obligations have run off. This would mean securing no more loans on existing revenues. This might not please Sir Francis Aglen, but, on the other hand, he might like the idea of being made the guardian of the whole existing revenue for the purpose of paying off gradually the whole of China&apos;s present debt.On the whole, therefore, if the customs agree to collect these taxes for the Canton Administration, the consequences do not seem to be very alarming. China must some day acquire tariff autonomy and resume control over her customs revenues a control which she only lost in 1911 and this seems as smooth and easy a way of achieving that end as any. Indeed, the fiasco of the Tariff Conference seems to indicate that it is the only feasible way.On the other hand, if the customs refuse their assistance, the consequences of such a non possumus attitude, following so soon after the naval demonstration policy of 1918-24, may be very serious. Any administration set up by the Cantonese to collect the taxes would grievously harry foreign trade. The welcome change that has come over the Nationalists, not only in Canton, but also in other parts of China where they have recently established their domination, might be checked and the whole movement towards more friendly relations might receive a severe setback. The Cantonese would certainly entertain very bitter feelings towards the customs and they might definitely lay plans to seize the administration and eject the foreign  or perhaps only the British element from it as soon as they were ready. A healthy evolutionary movement might, if checked and turned back on itself, end in disaster.His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided to acquiesce in these new taxes and to favour assistance being rendered by the customs solely because that seems to be the only means of terminating the boycott and because the price we are called upon to pay is not too heavy. But if the question be examined from the point of view of high policy, it is probable that, on these grounds also, this decision will be found to be both wise and far-sighted.Colonel Flayley Bell, Commissioner of Customs at Canton, has advised that the Customs agree to collect the new taxes, and Mr. Edwardes, Acting Inspector-General of Customs, concurs in this view. Even if Sir Francis Aglen were convinced of the soundness of this advice, he could not lightly agree to Canton&apos;s proposals. To do so might expose him to the suspicion of using the Customs Administration to help the British out of their boycott difficulties in Canton, and this might expose him to such violent attacks from other Powers, e.g., Japan or America, as to make his position untenable. He must demand that the instructions to collect these taxes reach him through the usual channels, and if the instructions plainly conflict with treaty stipulations, he is entitled to demand that the difficulties with the foreign Powers be adjusted before collection begins. In the last resort, if the Chinese insist, he is only entitled to collect these taxes if compelled thereto by force majeure, and in order to save his administration from grave danger. Sir Francis Aglen has already stated that he will not collect the taxes except under force majeure, and we have nothing to complain of in such an attitude, which seems to be perfectly correct.J. T.
