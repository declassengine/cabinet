this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;&amp; government.43Printed for the Cabinet, 12th November, 1926.SECRET.CP. 381 (26).THE CABINET.APPLICATION BY THE IRISH FREE STATE FOR A LIGHT TANK, MARK II.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETAEY OF STATE FOR WAR.In March last the High Commissioner of the Irish Free State applied to me for a light tank, Mark II, which is an up-to-date design with certain secret constructional details which cannot be seen by ordinary observers or ascertained from photographs. As there was no surplus tank of that description available for disposal, 1 was able to give that as a reason for refusing his request. He was apparently unwilling to accept another type of tank which was available, and asked whether the War Office would agree to the Irish Free State Government placing an order for a Mark II tank with Messrs. Vickers, Ltd., who make them for the War Department. I am of opinion that it would be undesirable to accede to this request, as I am afraid that once the Free State Military Authorities got the tank into their possession, the technical details might become known to foreign officials however much we may urge the importance of secrecy. Tanks are difficult to manufacture and we have a certain start which we are anxious to maintain. Moreover, apart from the fact that one tank is of no military value, it is not clear why the Free State Government want one at all. Their military force is not organised, as are the military forces of other Dominions, in such a way as to co-operate with a British Expeditionary Force, and their staff is in no way in touch with the British staff. We have, therefore, no ready means of finding out from them for what military purpose they want the tank, but we do know that they are in close touch with the U.S.A. military authorities. If the details reach America, they will enable American armament firms to compete more successfully with us in the market for such vehicles, and to supply them to our potential enemies.The Secretary of State for the Dominions, on the other hand, to whom I have referred the matter, sees great difficulty in refusing the High Commissioner^ request.He points out that a refusal of the request would involve drawing a distinction between the Irish Free State and the other Dominion forces, and he doubts whether the risk of leakage in the case of the Free State as compared with the risk in supplying a tank, e.g., to Canada, outbalances the political advantage of a demonstration on the eve of the Defence Conference of our readiness to co-operate.My advisers and I have taken into account these considerations, but remain of opinion that it would be desirable to refuse the High Commissioners request altogether, as I do not think we could impose any conditions either now or at the forthcoming Defence Conference which would ensure the secrecy of the design if it got into the hands of the Free State Military Authorities.L. W.-E,The War Office,12th November 1926.Copt &quot;No.     3 0(B26/17)   100   11/26   W.O.P.   2888
