DOG&apos;0?/mvT :IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS -BRITANNIC majesty&apos;s GOVERNMENT) .fi^E C R T T.COPY NOCABINET.PROPOSES CREATION OR A KINGDOM OF IR3LA1JD. Rote by the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs with reference to the memorandum by the Secretary cf State for Foreign Affairs   (C.P.423(26)   ) on my report  (C.P.416  (26))  of my conversations with Mr. 0&apos;Kiggins,  I left Mr. 0&apos;Higgins under no possible doubt that I regarded his suggestion cf a !iDual Tionarchy&quot;,  involving the creation of a separate Irish Kingship, as directly contrary to the principles agreed upon at the Imperial Conference and as unacceptable. I have since also made this clear to Mr.  Heady,  who dismissed the suggestion as  fantastic,    I wrote to Sir James Craig immediately after Mr. 0&apos;Kiggins&apos;  second talk with me, warning him of the danger cf this point being raised, but his reply made it clear that the discussion could not get that far as he was entirely &quot; opposed ab initio to any form of union with the Pree State.    Ho further action, therefore,  seems required, but the point will need watching if ever such a change of opinion takes place in Northern Ireland as to make it  inclined to consider seriously the possibility of joining the &quot;Free State.(Intldc)  L.S.A,Dominions Office,22nd December,  1026.
