THIS DOOTOOTg IS gHB PR0PJ3HPY 0? HIS BBIEANNIO MAJESTY&apos;S GOVEMMEtTT.Copy Ho.   3*oOA BO a T.392(26)YlOffilMISASIOIT BY SHADE UNIONS - GOYSBLIMMT PLKPGjS. Memorandum hy the Minister of Labour.As the question is likely to be raised in the House of the steps taken by the Government to carry out the pledge given by them during the General Strike,    I oiroulate a memorandum on the position for the information of my colleagues.As the law now stands, I have no power to control tho action of the Unions, nor has an aggrieved member any legal remedy, except possibly to obtain, at considerable&apos; expense, a declaration :.rom the Courts against actual expulsion.What I have been doing is to endeavour to get the penalties removed by the Unions themselves, in the cases brought to my notice.     In some instances the Executives have themselves given instructions which have had the desired effect;.      In others, the Executives have had no authority to do this and it has been nocessary for the aggrieved member to appeal under the rules of the Union, first prying the fine, if that was the penalty.     A number of such appeals have been successful and in no case so far has en appeal been finally unsuccessful.     In a few cases the member refuses to appeal and has thus brought about a deadlock..The Executives in general are reedy to do what they can to get the penalties removed, but in the oase of at least one Union there is the difficulty that some of its members have been,,as it alleges, &quot;victimized&quot; by an employer and this may make it less easy for the Executive to allow an appeal in the cases here in question.
Generally speaking, however, the present disposition of the xakeoutlves is such that I see no reason to suppose that the outstanding cases  (except those in which the member refuses to appeal) will not be put right in time.In devising a- legal remedy which would be really effective we should have to consider two points whioh would affeot the member of a union, expense in asserting his rights and subsequent exposure to possible victimisation.     Shis, however,  is a matter whioh can be considered later in connection with the proposed Trade Union Bill.      In the mean-time, while reserving the possibility of obtaining compulsory powers,    I propose, if my colleagues agree, to oontinue for the present my efforts to settle oases on the lines I have explained.This mems, I ^m afraid, that in the oases in whioh the aggrieved member refuses to take the necessary steps to appeal, nothing more can be done for the present;    but I do not see how this can be helped.     As regards cases not hitherto reported to the 3)epartraent,    I should propose to announce in the House that any case which is notified to me will be taken up with a view to settlement, but that obviously the Government cannot be held responsible for oases not brought to their notioe.(Intd,) A. S, - M.Ministry of Lrbour. 19th November, 1926.
MEMORANDUM.The Government.!.s Pledges ,,1,     During the General Strike notices were published in the press and otherwise giving certain Government guarantees to loyal workers, the first of which appeared in the British Gazette on Thursday, the 6th May, and was as follows&quot;-0 all workers in all trades -When the present general strike is ended His Majesty&apos;s Government will take effectual measures to prevent the victimisation by Trades Unions of any man who remains at work or who may return to work; and no settlement will be agreed to by His Majesty1s Government which does not provide for this for a lasting period and for its enforcement, if necessary, by penalties.     No man who does his duty loyally to the country in the present crisis, will be left&quot; unprotected by the State from subsequent reprisals&quot; .The second notice appeared on Saturday, the 8th May, and was as follows  :-&quot;Tp all workers in al 1 Trades.    Additional Guarantees. Official  :-Every man who does his duty by the country in the present crisis will be protected by the State from reprisals and from loss  of benefits or pension, and legislation for this purpose will be proposed at an early date&quot;.This second notice was revised by a third notice appearing for the first time on Monday, the 10th fey, as follows  :-&quot;To all workers in al 1 Trades ._Additional guarantees.Official  :-Every man who does his duty by the country and remains at work or returns to work during the present, crisis will be protected by the State from loss of Trade Union benefits, superannuation allowances or pension.     His Majesty&apos;s Government will take whatever steps are necessary in Parliament or otherwise for this purpose.      STANLEY BALDWIN&quot; .it will be seen that from the point of view of Governmental action the second pledge, issxied on the 8th May, definitely committed the Government to legislation, but this notice was very quickly followed by the third notice on the 10th May, which clearly implied that the Government would not proceed to legislation unless all other methods of guaranteeing the position of loyal workers proved unavailing.
Summarising the position generally, the Prime Minister in a speech in the House of Commons on the 13th May said:-     &quot;I have given no pledges at all save one, and that is that those who helped the C-overnment should not suffer for having done sotr. And at no time, either in the third notice which appeared over his name, or in his public utterances has the Prime Minister undertaken to legislate in order to fulfil the terms of the various pledges which were given.     It was left to the Minister of Labour to settle, so far as he could, any individual cases that were brought to his notice arising out of these pledges.SIZE OF THE PROBLEM.2,        So far, the number of cases which have been reported to me affect only 99 men, who were said to have been threatened by their Unions or branch of their Unions with penalties of fines, expulsion or refusal of benefits.      Of these 99 cases 42 have been   disposed of, either by reinstatement in the Union following upon expulsion or by remission of the fines.     In one or two of these cases it was found on investigation that the Government s pledges were not involved, and in one case it was found that no action had in fact been taken by the Union against the man.     There are 57 cases outstanding, 28 affecting members of the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers and 14 affecting members of the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers,     Negotiations are still proceeding in the majority of these cases,A schedule is attached showing the Unions concerned and the number of men affected in each Union,The types of cases which have been reported include expulsion from the Union, the imposition of a fine and the withholding of strike benefit * Cases in the last category have arisen mainly where men joined the Special Constabulary whilst on strike.LIKE OF ACTION TAKEN AND RESULTS.3,        The method of settlement hitherto adopted has been that of negotiation by my Department between the men themselves and their Trade Unions,   The advantage of this course is obvious.   The object to be aimed at is to reinstate the aggrieved member In as good a position in his Union as he occupied before the General Strike.     But reinstatement will lose Its value In most cases from the men&apos;s own point of view if it is achieved at the point of the bayonet,     In that event, it may make him e marked man among his fellows and thus inflict on him dis-advantages which no legislation can touch and no govern-ment alleviate.
4. On the whole, the Executives of the Unions havetaken a very reasonable attitude.     Some of them Issued instructions to their branches following the termination of the General Strike to the effect that no penalties should be Imposed on members for action taken during the General Strike.     The Printing Trades Federation, for example, took the line that, as the strike was of doubtful legality, members could be regarded as having exercised a discretion to which they were entitled.   The Executive Council of the National Union of Railwayman decided that no member should suffer loss of benefits for having remained at work during the strike.    The Executives of the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Electrical Trades Union similarly issued instructions to their branches to the effect that action should not be taken against members,5. Difficulties, however, have arisen.     These areprincipally due to the fact that the branches of some Unions ha- 3 a considerable measure of autonomy and in such cases the Executives have no power to override, on their own Initiative, decisions of the branches which are apparently in accordance with the rules.     In view of this the Executives of these Unions have taken the line, in those cases where branches have Imposed penalties on members, that the men should appeal against the decision of the branch In accordance with the rules of the Union,     In particular, the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers, the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers, the National Society of Painters and the Electrical Trades Union have ad-opted this line, and In cases affecting members of these Unions, my Department has advised the men to appeal in-^HX^orblance with the rules. The main difficulty which arises in this connection is due to the fact that members have to pay their fines before they can appeal under the rules.     This method of settlement has so far been justified, as in all cases where my Department has advised the men to appeal and the appeal has gone forward to the Executive Council of the Union, the appeal has been allowed, and there Is every likelihood that the same line would be taken with other cases.      There have, however, been some cases in which, as a matter of principle, a man has refused to pay his fine and/or appeal against the decision of the branch.      In these oases the argument is used that the General Strike was an illegal conspiracy; that the penalties in question were imposed by Unions on members for refusing to commit an illegal act;    that to follow the usual procedure would, in the present case, be tantamount to an admission that the propriety of refusing to join in the general strike is an open question, and that
therefore, the Unions cannot claim that that procedure should be fallowed,.      In this respect, therefore, an impasse hr-s been reached whioh a.ffeots a number of the cases outst ending.consider IDEATIONS AirfraCTIUG THH PRS&amp;Mg POSITION.6.     The legal aspect of the matter is the first, of these. Under the Astbury judgment the General Strike was declared to be illegal.     Some of my advisers, however, are of opinion that this does not necessarily mean that the action of a p particular Union in calling on its members to cea.se work in acoordance with its rules in support of the miners was also illeg&quot;l.      If this contention is true, then there is no v-lid ground for the objection, noted above, to follow the procedure whioh involves payment of the fine before the appeal is heard by the Tr^do Union -Executive.     I am not prepared, however, to accept this view *s final without fur t h e   advice,7.      7ith the exception of one or two cases,  it is probrble that those men, who have objected to following the usual procedure of their Union as regards appeals, have not acted on their own initiative.      They h;;. ve been prompted to do so by others.8.     It is also alleged that there are many men who have been penalised by their Unions, but whoso oases have not been reported to ray Department.      Captain P. Llacdonald, the Member for the Isle of &apos;7ight, for example, has informed me that, owing to the fear of intimidation, it was with great difficulty that he persunded seven men at Cowos to givo him their names with a view to their cases being t^ken up under tho pledge,  and that there *-re many other men in Cowos who have not had the same courage to report their case,      If this is the position in Cowes, there is reason to suppose that a similar situation may exist elsewhere..this is a point of substance, but, whilst I have little doubt that there are oases of victimisation which have not been reported to my Department, I an inclined to think that, having regard to the extensive publicity given to tho pledge, they are not so numerous as alleged.      My Department cannot, of course, assist aggrieved members unless they report their grievanoos, but&apos;, on the other hand, it is of the utmost importance thst there should be no suspicion that the Govern-ment is not doing all it can, so thrt those, who wish to come forward *-nd avail themselves of the pledge, can do so. If, however, it is true that aggrieved members are not reporting their oases to my Department because they fear further victimisation, it seems to mo that they will be still less likely to court the publicity that leg-l action against their Union would involve.ALTi&amp;dulTITiJ ACTION.9.      If, on the other hand, it is felt that it is necessary to go further in order to force the hands of the Unions and give those members, who have refused to appeal or who h*-ve not reported their oases to my Department, a further opportunity of getting their grievances redressed, then
legislation will be necessary.      And it vould not bo enough merely to provide that a man shall not suffer any penalty on account of his action during tho General Strike; in itself this would not give him my enforceable rights to benefit,     As the law stands, ra aggrieved member is prevented by Section 4(3)  (a) of the frrrd;;: Union Act, 1871, fx era sacing his Union for benefits due to him.      It wouldt therefore, be neceserry to repeal - so frr re General Strikes are concerned at any rato - a Section of an Act which hps been in operation for over 50 ye-rs.      If this were done, a member could then cue his union for the benefits he had lost.     But *-member could not sue his Union without incurring some expenditure&apos;;    he would accordingly bo suffering financial lose, for his action during the General Strike.      It- vould, therefore, bo neoee&amp;nry either for the Attorney-Gonernl or the Registrar of friendly Societies to sue on his behalf, or alternatively, the Registrar would hn-e to be given power to make an order, equivalent to a County Court Order, to the effect that, notwithstanding tho Act of 1871 &apos;-nd the rules of the Union, any penalties imposed by the Union were thereby annulled and repayable.10.    Provision, however, would also have to be made for other contingencies.     A man who brings an rction against his Union lays himself open to further victimisation either by the Union or by his fellow members.      the rules of the Amalgamated Union of Building Crrde Workers, for example, provide that any member taking legal action rgainst the Union shall be expelled.     Many Unions have a rule providing for the expulsion or fining of a member for &quot;acting contrary to the interests of the Union&quot;,      It would accordingly be necessary in any legislation to safe-guard members against such rules,&apos;    Ho legislative s* fe-guards could, however, bo devised that would prevent a member from being victimised by his fellow members and the aggrieved member would have no support from his Union ageinst this kind of victimisation, for obviously tho ifeecutives of tho Unions would regard any legislation as an attack upon them and would not continue their present reasonable rttitude.     Accordingly, whereas in those cases settled by conciliation the i&amp;iecutivee would bo less likely to countenance the continued victimisation by his fellow members of a man who had hrd his penalties cancelled by adopting the constitutional procedure, they would not be so likely to discountenance such victimisation if legisla-tion were pasaed.     An element of bitterness would Inevitably be introduced, ---nd this would be bound to have reactions on the general Industrial situation.0QIT0LUSI0K3.11,    Lc sum up, the position is -(l)     hat, of the comprratively few cases brought to the iep^rtruant &apos;s notice, nearly half have- been disposed of by conciliatory methods which it is desirable to continue.      In the event it is anticipated that nearly all the cases will be disposed of;
(2)    That thexe may in the future he some cases in which the SSxccutives refuse to reinstate their members who have been penalised, but it is hoped that such a situation will not arise. If it does, then the position will have to he reviewed;(3)    That in any case there will be a residuum of tiases - at present the number is 3 - where either on principle or for some other reason the man who has been penalised refuses to appeal in accordance with the rules of the Union;(4)    That there rre probably a number of cases which have not been reported to the Department. In respect of these I think an opportunity should be taken of stating in the House that my Department is prepared to take up every case reported with a view to getting it amicably settled.(Intd.)
