Private and personal. Secret.    At meeting of Lord P.alfourfs Committee on Intor-Imperial Relations on 4th November Mackenzie King brought up question of Governors General ceasing to be the channel of communication between the Dominion Governments and ourselves.      His main ar.gur.ent was that present arrangement was not in accordance with modern conception of Governor General as representative of the King, and tended to obscure Governor-General&apos;s real position and create misunderstsending by suggesting that he was still in some sense the Agent of the British Government.     &apos;It was not very clear what procedure as regards future channel of communication was contemplated by Mackenzie King but I imagine it would be that of direct communioation from the Dominion department dealing with external affairs to Dominions Office for all matters not already dealt with as from Prime Minister to Prime Minister.      It was fully recognised that the Governor General should continue to see all communications of importance passing by the new channel and indeed by any other channel e.g. High Commissioners and you would I presume regard it as essential that any such change would have to be accompanied by some definite understanding as to Governor General being kept fully informed on Cabinet business and public affairs&apos;generally as His Majesty the King is here.Mackenzie King further pointed out that apart from question of channel of documentary communication there is really no oral communication today of British Government&apos;s views and no representation of British interests as such the Governor General no longer being the recipient of instructions
on policy and still less free to regard himself as champion of specifically British interests a    His conclusion was that in seme Dominions at exvj rate there might he great practical advantage in the establishment of some office which would be in effect that of High Commissioner for Great Britain.Position and functions of such a British High Ooasmisaioner in a Dominion would of course need very careful thought.    He would naturally have under him trade commissloners and any migration, representatives we may appoint as well as necessary assistance on general policy questions,    Mackenzie ICing* s idea, of his main task is that it would be one which by the very circumstances of his position,  is difficult if not impossible for Governor Genera,! viz:  to interpret to the Dominion Government and, where necessary,  to press upon them views of Governmenthere, and generally to represent to Dominion public sta.ndpo.int of Great Britain.Questions raised were reserved by British representatives on Committee for discussion by Cabinet-    This will take place next Wednesday and I should like to know before then what your views would be on first proposal., which received genera,! support except from yaw Zealand and Newfound-land, and what you think of second which was also received in principle with similar favour though it did not appear that the matter was regarded as one on which&quot; early action was contemplated in all cases0    This telegram is being sent  to all Go v e r no r s G e ne ra, 1, ( To Union only)iThe position in South Africa is of course peculiar owing to the combination of Governor-General with High Commissioner the latter title standing for something very-different from the proposed new office,?AMERY.

HTelegram from the Governor General kjx Canada, to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, Dated 8th November, l&apos;J26;. Received Dominions Office 5 057 p.nu8th November, 1926.Immedi ate private and personals Secret.. 8th November.I agree with Mackenzie King!s proposal as contained in your telegram of 5th November and feel that appointment of High Commissioner would make my position as Governor General more satisfactory and would create definite appointment of officer representing the British Government in Canada, a position which King correctly states is, under the present system, impossible for me to fill.    I should certainly expect to see all important communications passing between the Dominion Government and- the High Commissioner and to be kept fully informed on Cabinet business and public affairs by the Prime Minister and his Cabinet colleagues.    Consider too that it should be clearly understood that I should have full liberty to write private letters to the Secretary of State from time to time.My letter of 5th November to you in regard to Trade Commissioner is interesting having regard to this proposal for it was written before I received your tele gram0You appear to suggest from your telegram that King1s proposal can be taken in two parts.    To my mind it must stand as a whole.    If Governor General is to cease to he the official channel of communication I consider it essential that a High Commissioner should be appointed at the same time as the Governor Generalxs position is altered,
Hope that I may have opportunity of expressing opinion individually before appointment is made. Having regard to the importance of his duties consider that he should be person with experience of Parliament and public affairs0
Secret.     Your secret telegram of 5th November.      I think increased direct communication between British and Australian Prime Ministers highly desirable and I see no objection to subordinate matters passing direct from the Dominions Office to the Prime Minister&apos;s Department provided that I am kept thoroughly informed from home and continue to receive Cabinet papers as hitherto, and that it is unequivocally laid down that the Prime Minister must keep me informed of his messages home,      These changes are justified by the desirability of eliminating the Governor General from the political sphere but I presume that ceremonial messages to and from Australian nation will continue to be received and issued by him.Mackenzie King&apos;s second proposal involving appointment of British High Commissioner In the Dominions seems to me open to grave objections as far as Australia is concerned. The principle may be theoretically sound and if there were good reasons for believing that such appointment would facilitate Intercourse between the British and Dominion Governments and stimulate trade and migration there would be strong argument in favour of trying the experiment. Such results are however doubtful and in any case It would appear to be wiser to attempt their attainment in the firstTelegram from the Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.Dated 8th November.

2place by improving the existing machinery,On the other hand I think it is certain that the appointment of British High Commissioner here would weaken the position of the Governor General by accentuating artificial ceremonial and mechanical aspect of his office abSlition of which is already advocated by extreme Labour on the grounds of expense of maintaining alleged useless anachronism.Though this view is confined to the minority of the opposition now account must be taken of the situation which would be created by the return of Labour to power supported amongst others by disloyal minority ivhich would have representation in the Cabinet.      If this coincided with bad season necessitating drastic economies or even as a matter of general policy desirability would probably be urged of confining representation of Britain to the High Commissioner paid by British taxpayer and saving the substantial expenditure borne by Australia in maintaining the Governor General.      Since much of this goes in entertaining Labour&apos;s political opponents including rich minority who show little zeal for public service strong platform case could be presented. Involving the Crown In political controversy in most unfortunate way.For above reasons  I think that suggested appointment would be a dangerous and expensive mistake.      Ends.
2Private and Personal.   My secret telegram of to-day. The Crown is the real link between Britain and Australia understood and cherished by overwhelming majority hei&apos;e. Its position is now eminently satisfactory,  thanks to personal action of His Majesty ?    Prince of Wales, and my predecessor.    But the position of a subject holding the office of Governor General is necessarily anomalous and vulnerable and the opponents of the present system would welcome substitution of High Commissioner for him. Though they are small minority to-day it would be a mistake to ignore them or play into their hands- Suds,TSLHSRAM from the Governor General of Australia to the Secretary- of State for Dominion Affairs, Dated 8th November,  1926, (Received, Dominions Office 12,20 p.m. 8th November,  1926).
SECRET. My telegram of 8th November. Please note that my acquiescence in the proposed change in. the channel of communication is strictly conditional on my receiving copies of all communications sent to ray Prime Minister from London-direct and not through hir/it,TELEGRAM from the Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia to  the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.Dated 9th November, 1926, (Received Dominions Office 7,45 a,m.  9th November).
Immediate.        Private and Personal,        Secret.Your telegram of 5th November Inter-Imperial relations, My views on the first proposal coincideexactly with those expressed in lord Jellicoers personal and secret despatch of the 22nd March, 1922, as supple-mented by my private letter to you of the 27th April last and I cannot too strongly emphasise my conviction that any departure from the procedure by which the Governor General is the recognised channel of communica-tion will prove detrimental to the prestige of the Crown in the Dominion(s) and will weaken Imperial link.I cannot agree with Mr.Mackenzie King1s conception of the proper functions of the Governor Genera,! nor can I discover in the new proposal any real advantages to Imperial interests which outweigh those conferred by the existing system.    If the pov:.-ers of self-government of the Dominions are for all practical purposes already unfettered, the proposed curtailment of the Governor General1s usefulness in a sphere in.which the value of his influence in the direction of Imperial unity has been amply demonstrated would be in my opinion a retrograde step.      The change contemplated would it is true enable him to see such Important correspondence as those conducting It may at their discretion decide to send to him but in cases for example of communications emanating from Dominion Govern-ments he would not be apprised of them until after aTEIEGRAM from the Governor General of New Zealand to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.Dated 8th November. (Received Colonial Office 4.10 a.m. 8th November,1926).
decision had &quot;been taken and until after they had been despatched.The constitutional functions of office are strictly and I believe wisely limited but the position of a Governor General reduced to a mere social figure-head, presiding over a democratic community where there is no hereditary aristocracy, where no sharply defined class distinction exists and where even amongst so loyal a people as those of New Zealand a Governor General is judged largely by his practical usefulness, would-seem to me a most invidious one. To advertiseto the world that he is to be shorn of what has hitherto been regarded as one of his primary functions would . inevitably lead to a diminution of the respect and regard in which he is now held and the Grown1s prestige would suffer proportionately.T/ith regard to the idea that the position of the Governor General in the Dominion should, resemble that of the King I do not wish to minimise the great honour of representing His Majesty but it is plain that from a social aspect no influence which the    Governor General could exercise however wisely could be more than a faint reflection of the great social power wielded, by the Sovereign with his attributes as head of the Empire and with all the weight of centuries of tradition behind the throne and person.The second proposal vis.  the appointment of High Commissioner(3)  for Great Britain would, of course, place the Dominions in much the same category as foreign countries and presupposes the same relations with frequent conflict of interests between the centre of the Empire and its component parts as now exists
between Great Britain and a foreign nation.     If in addition to a High Commissioner clothed with ambassadorial functions the office of Governor General is to survive it is difficult to imagine a suitable type of man willing to accept the position of a mere cypher at considerable sacrifice of private means Involved. &apos;To sum up:if Mr. Mackenzie King1s proposals are designed to eliminate the usefulness of the office of Governor General and. to lower the prestige of the occupant then in my opinion they could hardly have been more admirably conceived.I am grateful to you for giving me the opportunity of making these observations.      Without embarking upon detailed argument I have stated the position as it appears to me with complete frankness in the belief that you wished, me to do so.If you have no objection I should like my Prime Minister to see this statement of my views.
Telegram from the Governor General of Union of South Africa to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs*Dated 8th November, 1926, Received Dominions Office 6f35 p,m, ,8th Novrn1926.8th November, ?r iv ate and Porsonal, Secret, .Your private and personal telegram of 5th November,, Position of Governors General;      I was not unprepared for the question &quot;brought up by Mackenzie King though I do net think there is any strong feeling on the subject in South Africa,      With development of the status of the Dominions it was to be expected that the functions of Governor General should undergo some changes and there is no doubt his position as the King*s representative and also in some sense agent of the British Government is liable to load to difficulty.      In the course of my term of office here I have sometimes felt that my usefulness would be greater were there not the feeling in&apos; my ministers7 minds that I was not simply and solely the constitutional head of the Dominion but also had responsibilities towards the Imperial Government,      I am not disposed therefore to offer any opposition to the proposal, which of course,  if strongly desired by the Dominion,  could not be rejected.      Moreover I believe that in these circumstances the office of Governor General,  if its powers were handled judiciously, would become more and not less effective.    No mention seems to have been made of the method of appointment  of the Governor General, but I assume that if this proposal is acted upon the appointment will be made by the King on the advice of his Dominion Ministers without the
intervention of the British Government.      I entirely agree with your remarks regarding&apos; the communication of all important correspond once to the Governor General, who would be seriously handicapped if he were not kept fully informed on oil public affairs,      I hope that a definite understanding on this point will be embodied in any arrangement that may be arrived at.The question of the appointment of (a) representa-tive(s) of the British Government in the Dominion presents more difficulties though it is a natural consequence of the first proposal.      It would be specially important that  (&apos;? Group omitted) very careful to differentiate his functions from those of the Governor General so as to avoid confusion in the public mind.      If he is to treat with the Dominion Government on terms of equality ho will have to bo given appropriate status and his position vis-a-vis the Governor General should be defined as exactly as possible, I should have thought that with direct cornmunication between the Union and the British Government as contemplated an additional link in the chain was hardly necessary and there is a danger in multiplying the offices for which there is no real  justification,l/ith regard to the special difficulties in South Africa arising out of the fact that the Governor General is also High Commissioner,  I presume that it is not proposed to deprive the Governor General of his responsibilities towards the High Commission Territories,      I do not consider that such a change would be necessary and I certainly think that it would be unwise.      As you arc avare, the natives attach great importance to their connection with the King, and to remove them from the control of the Xing1a representative
would certainly not &quot;be understood and would most probably be strongly resented.   The ultimate fate.of the Territories is absorption in the Union and I should deprecate any alteration in their form of Government in the meantime. It would of course be quite impossible to have two High Commissioners in South Africa, but this difficulty could be met by an alteration in the title either of the new post or of the old .    V/ould it not be possible for instance to call your representative &quot;Commissioner for Great Britain&quot; if the Agent General is not considered adequate.    Or again might it not be appropriate to mark the &quot;change in the position of the Governors General by giving them the title of Viceroy, which would have the advantage of emphasising their direct relationship to the King.    This however may be thought too grandiloquent for the head of a democratic community and it Is merely thrown out as a suggestion as to the lines on which the problem, which In any case is not of the first importance, could be solved.
VICE REGiiL LGuGE, DU3LIn. 8th H o v err be r, 1926.My dear Amery,As I gather that your secret and private message of the 5th November is not one which I should communicate to Ministers I give you my own personal views upon it.While I do not agree that the present arrangement in any way obscures the Governor General&apos;s position I should see no objection to direct communication from the Dominions Department dealing with external   affairs in all matters not already  dealt with as  from Prime Minister to prime Minister, provided the Governor General  is kept fully informed on Cabinet business and public affairs generally.    There is, however,   this fact to be borne in mind:  because of the existing arrangement three lady secretaries,   who are the same ss  in the time of Lord French and Lord FitzAlan,  are attached  to this Lodge,  and it would be most unfair  to them were a change made that their future position should not be provided for.    One would, certainly have to be dispensed with, and I think it should be made a term of any new arrangement that all three should be placed upon the Civil Service Establishment and regarded as Civil Servants for purposes of pension, as  from the date when they first took on Government Service .As to the second point of the establishment of a British High Commissioner in Ireland,   I would strongly advise His16 Right Honourable L.S. Amery,  M.P.SECRET.
jvla jesty&apos; s Government under the present state of things  2here to exclude Ireland from any such arrangement should it be adopted elsewhere.    The closeness of the twoIslands readers any comparison for this  purpose with the Canadian or Australian Dominions an absurdity.    while undoubtedly these Dominions would gain in status were s British resident to bo  set up there,  el though it is possible the exercise of his powers or the expression of his opinions might very easily lead to   friction,  the Irish Free State has been set up too vecentlj to enable historical prejudices to be dissipated,   especially while an active hostile propaganda is directed against it.I might add, perhaps,   a personal note as to the disparity of the position of the Irish Governor General with that  of other Dominions, and ever with the position of the Irish High Commissioner in London.    I do so,  not for  the purpose of raising a point on my own behalf,  but,  lest it should be said I overlooked the interest of my successors in future days. I refer to the belief that all other Governors General are free from taxation and import duties.    This is not the  case in the Irish Free State where a higher proportion of income tax is exacted on the salary mentioned in the Treaty than was borne by the late Lords Lieutenant.&apos;I remain,My dear Amery,Faithfully yours,(S i g ne d )        T, M* HEALY.
\Telegram from&apos; the Governor of Newfoundland to the Secretary of State:for Dominion Affairs.Dated 8th November, 1926. (Received Dominions Office,  11,5 p.m. 8th November1926)Private and personal.      Secret.      8th November,-v/ith reference to your private and personal telegram of 5th November.     Proposal one.      I concur that should changebe decided on a way should be found to keep governor general fully informed of Cabinet business and public affairs generally.      Number two proposal.      I am (?)somewhat concerned as to whether the appointment of High Commissioner to a Dominion might not in the course of time result in weakening the status of the Governor General to such an extent as to allow of the question being asked whether the maintenance of that Office was necessary,      T7ere appointee from England not made fear that bonds of the Empire would thereby be very rrater.ia.lly weakened.      Should have thought that existing system by which Dominion Governments have views of His Majesty&apos;s Government at once supplied them in deta.il on every important question that arises or that may in any way affect them both through, the Governor Generals and. their High Commissioners would have been all that was required in the meanwhile.      As you are aware public press in the Dominions gives twice daily to its readers in the  larger cities a valuable precis of the important questions of the hour which frequently includes public standpoint.   .. This might be still further developed.      Venture to think that there is no immediate need for innovation of such a far reaching nature as is suggested In this proposal, Mackenzie King is said to have strong United States affinities.
