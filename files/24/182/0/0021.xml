THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJSSTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET. /I ^SECRET &quot;   &quot; Copy No   qOCTpTg96(26).--&apos;T POOR LAW REFORM AEP BLOCK GRANTS.Memorandum by.,the Minister of Health.While expressing no opinion at the moment on the detailed points? advanced In the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ Memorandum on. Poor Law Reform and&quot; block grants, CP.395(26), I sho\ild wish my colleagues to understand clearly the importance of the time factor In thio matter.     If it is decided by the Cabinet that poor lew reform and tho general block grant are both to proceed next year, the two bills required must be ready for introduction at or about Easter next year.     This could be done so far as the Poor Law Reform bill Is concerned.     But for the general block grant, we require -(a) a formula accepted by the Ministers concerned, or prescribed by the Cabinet, In the event of difference of opinion.(b) information as to the financial Implications of such a formula In the way of new Exchequer money, (o) negotiations and if possible substantial agreement with local authorities, (d) drafting and approval of a bill by the Home Affairs Committee. Reference to the Cabinet itself at any one or more of these stages may be necessary.I have grave doubts whether these various operations can, in fact, be carried thro\igh in anything like the time and whether the result of the endeavour to do eo my not in fact be to destroy any chance of securing the measure of Poor Law Reform which I have proposed.     In any event there must be no delay 4n the first and second stages above specified on which the advice of the Baratow Committee will presumably be sought.     I think therefore that if the Cabinet decides to proceed further on the lines suggested by the Chancellor (1) it must be an instruction to the Baratow Committee that a block grant formula is to be found and (2) that it is. to re-port to the Cabinet In a fortnight from the date of the Cabinet-discussion.N,CS3Wt  Wmrftrrihm- -   T&amp;Pfi&apos;.
