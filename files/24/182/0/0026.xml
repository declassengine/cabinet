SOUTH-WEST ARABIA. (C.I.D. Papers Nos. 720-B, 738-B, and 739-B.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a copy of a despatch from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires at Rome, covering a Memorandum on the Imam-Idrisi conflict in Arabia (C.I.D. Paper No. 720-B); a Report by the Chiefs of Staff on the position in South-West Arabia (C.I.D. Paper No. 738-B) ; and a telegram from the Resident at Aden to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the subject of the relations between the Imam, the Idrisi, and Ibn Saud (C.I.D. Paper No. 739-B).SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN briefly reviewed the salient factors of the situation. The Imam was being supplied by the Italians with munitions of war, and was threatening the Farsan Islands ; whereas the Idrisi, who claimed those islands, and to whom we had obligations, had no means of obtaining the where-withal to defend himself. The Admiralty regarded it as most important that the present status of the Farsan Islands should be maintained; and accordingly the Resident at Aden had been authorised to issue certain munitions to a British syndicate interested in the Farsan Islands, which in turn passed them on to the Idrisi. Thus came about a situation in which it might appear that Italy and Great Britain were waging war with each other under the flags of the Imam and the Idrisi. With a view to forestalling an embarrassing and delicate situation, he had [15436] . b
communicated a Memorandum to the Italian Government. Signor Mussolini had responded in the most friendly spirit, and had suggested that an expert should be sent to Rome to discuss the questions at issue with the Governor of Eritrea. It was necessary to decide on the terms of the instructions which should be given to this expert. In the first place he thought that it should be made clear that the Admiralty were specially interested in Kamaran and the Farsan Islands and considered it of the first importance that no foreign Power should be allowed to establish themselves on the Arabian shores of the Red Sea. In the second place the Chiefs of Staff Report showed that the expulsion of the Imam from the Aden Protectorate would involve an expedition which, in the view of the competent authorities, would not yield results commensurate with the expenditure involved.With regard to the negotiations with- Italy, he suggested that the Chiefs of Staff Report (C.I.D. Paper No. 738-B) should be the basis of his instructions to Sir Gilbert Clayton, whom he proposed to employ on this mission. The Report had set the Foreign Office the problem of making bricks without straw, or, perhaps, even mud, but he was sure that Signor Mussolini would be prepared to meet us in a friendly spirit so far as was compatible with the safeguarding of Italian interests.Mr. AMERY said that, from the Colonial Office point of view, the Imam&apos;s encroachments had caused a difficult situation in Aden. The territories he occupied were, of course, by no means essential, either to the existence or the defence of Aden itself; but the trouble lay in the fact that these territories had been part of our Protectorate since 1905, and we were under an obligation to the local tribes. When the Imam had first advanced, those tribes had fled to Aden, where they had received the most unqualified promises of our support. He agreed with the Chiefs of Staff that a military expedition on a large scale was impracticable, and he thought that the only possible solution was to bring the Air Force at Aden up to such a strength as to ensure the prevention of any further encroachments by the Imam. If acts of aggression were committed on our territory by the Imam he saw no reason why our Air Forces should not retaliate on the Imam&apos;s territories. He therefore suggested that the most effective measure would be to strengthen the Air Arm at Aden, and to explain to the Imam, on the one hand, that his presence in our Protectorate precluded the possibility of our establishing friendly relations with him, and, on the other, that, if he committed any further aggression, we should retaliate in whatsoever way appeared desirable to us. Mr. Amery thought it quite possible that the Air weapon would prove even more effective than the Chiefs of Staff anticipated, and, in support of this view, he cited the striking success that had been achieved over the Mad Mullah in Somaliland.He then turned to an aspect of the question which he found it difficult to discuss in the absence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for India. He referred to the hopeless chaos of Administration at Aden. The Resident at Aden was responsible to no less than four separate and distinct authorities, and everyone who had held the post had emphasised how impossible it was to achieve either economy or efficiency under such conditions. He suggested that a pre-requisite of any satisfactory arrangements in Aden was that the negotiations which had been dragging on for over two years between Departments with regard to the Administration of Aden should be brought to a head, and the responsibility definitely allocated to a single Department.SIR HUGH TRENCHARD reviewed the salient points of the Chiefs of Staff Report. Their main recommendation was that the strength of the Air Force at Aden should be increased to one Squadron, with a view to preventing further encroachments, by Air attack on the Imam&apos;s Territory. In that connection the Chiefs of Staff had learned from Sir Gilbert Clayton that, in his opinion, operations against Sana would have considerable effect. Such operations could not, however, be carried out from an aerodrome at Kamaran, owing to the possibility of international complications; but, should they become absolutely necessary, they could be launched from an aircraft carrier.He desired to emphasise the necessity of raising local levies on the lines suggested in the Report of the Chiefs of Staff.There was one point on which he desired to express a personal opinion. The Chiefs of Staff had stated in their Report that, in the event of Air action being taken against the Imam, the possibility of an attack on Aden itself by the Imam and the consequent necessity of increasing the garrison at that place, would have to be borne in mind. He, personally, did not think that there was any necessity to increase the Army garrison at Aden. *
, - SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN asked the Chief of the Air Staff to confirm that it was intended that offensive action across the frontier by our Air Force should be in reply to any further aggression, and not in anticipation of such aggression; and that due warning would be given to the Imam before such action was undertaken.SIR HUGH TRENCHARD confirmed this point; but stated that it was important that the warning to the Imam should be conveyed in general terms, and should include no specific reference to the possibility of the bombing of Sana.Mb. BRIDGEMAN said that the views of the Admiralty had been fully explained by the Chief of the Air Staff as the representative of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee. There was, however, another aspect of the question on which he would like information from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs: How far were we in touch with Ibn Saud ? Ibn Saud was the big man in that part of the world, and we ought to make use of him. He suggested that it should be pointed out to him that his interests and ours were identical in this matter; and that it would be to his advantage to support the Idrisi against the Imam. He had spoken to Lord Lloyd on this subject and he (Lord Lloyd) had agreed that something on these lines should be done.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN said that there were already distinct indications that there was friction between Ibn Saud and the Imam, as shown in the recent telegram from the Resident at Aden (Enclosure to C.I.D. Paper No. 739-B). Mr. Jordan was at the moment engaged in negotiations with Ibn Saud. He would ask his Department to consider the desirability as to whether instructions on the lines advocated by the First Lord should be given to Mr. Jordan. At the same time Sir Austen Chamberlain suggested that, if we told Ibn Saud that we intended to attack the Imam, it might have the very opposite effect to that which we desired, since Ibn Saud would be inclined to take no action himself.Mr. AMERY suggested that we might tell the Idrisi that we could not support him directly, but that it would be advisable for him to get in touch with Ibn Saud; and we might also approach Ibn Saud with the suggestion that he should take the Idrisi under his wing, though at the same time leaving&quot; him a measure of self-government.SIR SAMUEL HOARE said that the immediate and most important question to be decided was the strengthening of the Air Force at Aden. At present there was only one Flight of aeroplanes at Aden; and this was an uneconomic and militarily ineffective arrangement. Therefore, quite apart from the present situation in Aden, the suggestion to locate a Squadron instead of a Flight in that place was militarily and economically sound. If that was agreed upon it remained to decide the date on which this Squadron should be sent to Aden. From the point of view of the Air Ministry it would be convenient if the move were to take place next February, since, in that case, the Squadron which was being withdrawn from Iraq could be sent to Aden. Should, however, the situation demand the presence of a Squadron at Aden at an earlier date, he suggested that the arrange-ments should be left to the Air Ministry. Sir Samuel Hoare observed that the Treasury might be disposed to regard the location of a Squadron of the Royal Air Force at Aden as an attempt to increase the strength of the Home Defence Force beyond the approved strength of 52 Squadrons. He therefore suggested that the Squadron located in Aden should be regarded as a Home Defence Squadron, and the implication thus avoided.To sum up, he suggested that the Committee should agree on the following points: (i.) That the strength of the Air Force at Aden should be increased to one Squadron.(ii.) That this reinforcement should be effected in February 1927. (in.) That, in the event of the situation demanding this reinforcement at an earlier date, the necessary arrangements should be left to the Air Staff.SIR LAMING WORTHINGTON-EVANS said he had no objection to the above proposals, but he thought that the Committee ought not to make their decisions piecemeal.   It was necessary to examine all the conditions which the [15436] B 2
Chiefs of Staff had imposed in their Report, one of which was to the effect that the possibility of an attack on Aden by the Imam, and the consequent necessity of increasing the garrison at that place, should not be overlooked.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN enquired whether the danger of an attack on Aden by an Eastern Potentate with a force of about 2,000 men could really be regarded as serious.SIR HUGH TRENCHARD said that he had not the smallest doubt that, with a squadron of Air Force and the Military garrison which was already in Aden, there was not the slightest danger to Aden itself from such an attack.Mr. AMERY, in endorsing the recommendations that the strength of the Air Force at Aden should be brought up to one squadron, and that local levies should be raised, thought that it might be possible to consider a reduction of the garrison. With all deference to the Chiefs of Staff, he considered it unthinkable that there should be any serious danger to Aden from an attack by the Imam.LORD BALFOUR thought that it would be undignified to adopt the proposed attitude towards Ibn Saud. There were apparently two different problems: first, the question of the islands in the Red Sea, and secondly, the question of the Aden Hinterland. The only connection between the two was that both were threatened by the Imam. He considered that we should definitely and completely break off all relations with the Imam, and that we should tell him that we reserved to ourselves the right to expel him from our Protectorate whenever it suited us to do so; and that, in the meanwhile, we proposed to make his life as uncomfortable as possible by blockade, air action, or any other means we deemed desirable. The Imam would then know he had an overt enemy in the South, and this would make him particularly anxious about any attack from the North.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN said that he would prefer not to make any mention of a blockade. The declaration of a blockade meant the declaration of war. We could not break off relations, since we had no relations, in the strict sense of the term, with the Imam. Moreover, the declaration of a blockade would involve the seizure of Italian munitions of war.LORD BALFOUR, intervening, said that his suggestion for a blockade was only incidental to his general plan.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN, continuing, said that in other respects he agreed with the suggestions of Lord Balfour. He personally would like the Air Force at Aden strengthened as soon as possible, since it was impossible to say how quickly the situation might develop.SIR HUGH TRENCHARD said that the quickest method of reinforcement would be to ask the Admiralty for the service of the Aircraft Carrier &quot; Furious.&quot; It would be much more economical to wait until February, when a Squadron from Iraq would be available.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN asked why this Squadron could not be sent from Iraq now.SIR HUGH TRENCHARD explained that there were certain minor opera-tions in Iraq still in progress. -Mr. AMERY emphasised the importance of giving definite notice of our intentions. Up to the present there had been a sort of friendly agreement-to-differ, which we could not very well supersede by active hostilities.THE PRIME MINISTER then read out a suggested Conclusion, which, with minor adjustments, was accepted by the Committee.Conclusion.The Committee oe Imperial Defence agreed to submit the following recommendation to the Cabinet: &quot; The Committee of Imperial Defence recommend : (a.) That the Cabinet should approve in principle the Report of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (Paper No. 738-B), and take note that, in that event, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs will take the Report as the basis for instructions to the British representative in the forthcoming negotiations with the Italian Government.
(b.) That the strength of the Royal Air Force at Aden should be raised to one, Squadron as soon as this can be conveniently done. This disposition, the Committee note, will not involve an increase in the total strength of the Royal Air Force.(c.) That the Imam should be warned that his occupation of a portion of the Aden Protectorate renders him liable at any time to such measures of retaliation by land, sea or air, at such time and in such manner as we may deem suitable, and that any action on his part against any islands in the Red Sea is calculated to precipitate action on our part. This declaration should not be made until after the increase in the Royal Air Force at Aden has been effected.&quot;*!&quot;&apos; &quot;H&quot; $fc ^ ^
