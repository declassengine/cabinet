EGYPT.(Previous reference: C.I.D. Minutes of 208th Meeting, Minute 12.)The Committee of Imperial Defence took note of the following Conclusions* of the Cabinet on the subject of Egypt: &quot; That we should stand firmly to the present position and not allow any weakening of our authority in Egypt;That we should stand by all those who have stood by us in Egypt;That we should insist on a renewal of the contracts of British officials (many of which expire in .the Spring of 1927) until after the settlement of the four reserved points, and should seek gradually to replace British officials in some key posts which in recent years have been allowed to be given to persons of other than British or Egyptian nationality;That when we make a definite demand on Egypt we should insist on its being carried out;That we should do our utmost to avoid an application by Egypt for admission as a member of the League of Nations, and that this object should be secured, if possible, by action at Cairo.&quot;   (C.I.D. Paper No. 712-B.)SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN remarked that the third conclusion above had been drawn up after the Cabinet had heard a statement by Lord Lloyd. He was of opinion that this conclusion was couched in rather more general terms than the Cabinet had intended. Lord Lloyd on his return to Egypt had set up a Committee on this particular subject whose report had been considered by the* Cabinet 49 (26), Conclusion 1.[15437]SECRET. .-    dohmkiiVG:)
Egyptian Department of the Foreign Office, and oertain comments had been referred back to Lord Lloyd. He suggested that it was unnecessary to insist on the renewal of the contracts of British officials in every case, but only to concentrate on those cases which were of real importance. The conclusion as at present drafted might be interpreted as referring to every British official in Egypt. He suggested that the Secretary should bring this matter up at a convenient meeting of the Cabinet.******
