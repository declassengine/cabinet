IRON AND STEEL,MR DORMAN wrote&quot;The number of Blast Furnaces In operation at the end of September was further reduced to 5, a reduction of 1 on those in blast at the end of August.    The production of pig iron declined from 13,600 tons in August to 12,500 tons in September, as compared with 448,700 tons in September 1925, and 559,100 tons in April of this year.    The production of steel ingots and castings in September amounted to 95,700 tons as compared with 52,100 tons in August, and 640,100 tons in September, 1925, and 661,000 tons In April of this year.&quot;Imports of Iron and Steel during September were exception-ally heavy, reaching the formidable total of 445,704 tons against 315,100 tons in August.    To realise the great increase In deliveries of foreign material into this country I would remind you that the imports for 1925  (a record year) averaged 226,750 tons per month.    The exports for September totalled 160,218 tons,  slightly less than the figures for August.   As a comparison, the average monthly total for 1925 was 310,918 tons.&quot;Due to the Coal Strike still dragging on there is no change to report in the position of the Heavy Steel trade. Most works appear to have a considerable amount of work on their books, and the prospects generally indicate a busy period as soon as supplies of fuel are available.    The Sheet trade is satisfactory, and the Wire trade, although still dull, shows signs of improvement.    Continental Sheet Bars are quoted at not less than  6.0,0 ci.f. United Kingdom (East Coast), which is a big advance on the price ruling 6 months ago.   With the stabilisation of the Belgian franc, and the probable stabilisation-tion of the French exchange in the near future, it is considered that Continental prices are more likely to advance than fall.&quot;Several orders have been received recently by Shipbuilders on the North East Coast, but many more will be required before the Industry can claim to be busy.   However, the outlook seems brighter than it has been for some time past&quot;.MR. BAKER wrote&quot;There is little, if anything, to report with regard to the iron and steel trade.    One hears of works starting up at one place and others closing down at another.    On the whole I think things are pretty much the same as they have been for the past two months.&quot;The ascertainment for the North of England Sliding Scale gives an increased average net for ships plates which carries with it a 5% increase on the sliding scale, bringing wages up to 26tjf on, as from Sunday November 7th, but there will be few men at work now under this scale&apos;1.
STEEL..SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR, reporting on the Sheffield trade, said that the home trade had fallen off very much indeed since the Council&apos;s last meeting.   Export orders were still coming in very satisfactorily and most of the Sheffield manufacturers had a very large volume of export orders on their books.    The difficulty was that there could be no guarantee-that those orders would ever be executed.   Some of them had been on their books for a long time, and customers were getting very restive about their deliveries.    There were many orders for which heavy steel billets were necessary, and it was likely that when Sheffield was in a position to execute the orders, the people would not want the goods at all, and the orders would have to be cancelled.In regard to crucible steel and finished tools a good trade was being done in spite of the Coal Strike.    The great difficulty was that the German coke which they found satisfactory for their purpose had now been put up to 80/- a ton, and the latest news to hand was that the Germans would not book orders for coke at any fixed price.   They booked the orders and would charge whatever price they thought proper at the time of delivery.Chinese trade was now beginning to be affected by the exchange, although there was a fair amount of trade being done.   From Shanghai a cutting from a Chinese newspaper had been sent over, from which, it would be seen that a German firm was openly advertising arms and pistols, for sale to the   brigands and ruffians around Shanghai and the Treaty Ports. The arms embargo was not at all strictly kept by some foreign firms, though we, the British, adhered strictly to it.    (The newspaper paragraph was handed in).    Trade with other parts of the Empire was uniformly good.    There was a satisfactory Australian and New Zealand trade.   The conditions of the Canadian trade were also now quite good, but there again we were handicapped very much owing to lack of heavy steel billets. In South America the trade was good, except in Brazil. &quot;European trade was uniformly bad.   We could do nothing with France.    Our trade with Belgium was difficult, and we could do very little with Italy.    Switzerland was a fair market.    The action taken by the British Government in regard to the Anglo-Spanish Commercial Treaty had given a great deal of satisfaction to manufacturers in this country.    They thought it would have a good effect, and that we should come to a better arrangement with Spain.   They already found that the Customs and other Officials there were much more reasonable than they had been before it was announced that we should come to some new arrangement or terminate the present Treaty.As to the coal position&apos; generally, there was a good deal of outcrop coal still being sold in Sheffield and some of it could be got at fairly reasonable prices, but there was not so much available as there had previously been, for all the better miners who had been working outcrop coal had gone back to the pits.    In spite of the difficulties experienced among manu-facturers in Sheffield, the last thing that anyone wanted was an uneconomic settlement, or a political settlement, of the Coal Strike.   Having suffered as they had, and faced the situation as they had, and having maintained goodwill by losing
STEEL    (CONTP.)heavy sums of money,  they did not want all that thrown away by an uneconomic settlement of the Coal Strike.    Further,  it was,  of course right for the Public Utility    Companies and the Railways to be supplied with coal first, but the moment the Government could release some coal, particularly to the heavy steel trade,  to produce some billets, it would ease the whole situation very much.The situation was getting more difficult every day.   From 1st November fire-clay, bricks, and in fact everything used by steel works,  had been advanced from fifteen to twenty per cent, in price.   At the very moment when Sheffield makers were Informed of these advances,  which were perfectly natural in the circumstances, they got letters from their correspondents abroad requesting that they should reduce their prices by fifteen to twenty per cent, to meet the competition from Cjr.echo-Slovakia in particular,  end from Austria, Germany, and,  to some extent,  France.   Accordingly they had before them a difficult six months during which to strike a balance between these two demands.NON-FERROUS    METALS.SIR CECIL BUDD wrote:-&quot;The unsatisfactory state of affairs in the base metal industries, which I had to report at the last meeting, has continued and, indeed, has become intensified, and will, I fear,  continue at any rate until the coal strike has been brought to an end.&quot;SHIPBUILDING AND MOTOR MANUFACTURE.SIR J, THORNY CROFT referred to Lloyds&apos; recently published figures of shipbuilding,  as giving an Idea how unsatisfactory the position was as regards new construction, but not showing quite how bad it was as a   result of the Coal Strike.   It was reported from all the shipbuilding areas that the construction of vessels in hand was held up for want of material.   In some oases material had been ordered from the Continent but,  owing to the general demand for steel,  supplies were not sufficient to give any real help.   It would be very difficult to arrange for any fresh orders from this country at present, as a number of the steelmakers reported that, owing to their arrears,  they would not be able to take any orders for delivery until six months after they got to work again.   Reports from abroad seemed to indicate that prospective customers were aware of these difficulties and were chary of placing their orders here.   It was evident that, even if the Strike were to terminate at once, supplies could not be obtained In time to avoid a bad time in the shipyards again this winter.In regard to oil burning it would be found that, On the whole, the firms which were turning over to oil were the&quot;smaller users of power.    The big organisations were not doing so, for they had made their contracts for foreign coal.   Quite a number of small users were putting in temporary oil-installations, but very few seemed to think It worth while to adopt permanent installations.
SHIPBUILDING AND MOTOR MANUFACTURE (OONTD.)Y-ith regard to the motor oar industry, manufacturers generally had been very well satisfied with the demand for vehicles as a result of the Show, and in a number of cases the demand had exceeded their expectations;   but those firms which had laid themselves out for a large production were very rraioh concerned about the possibilities of getting their supplies during the next six months.   They had for sometime been endeavouring to tap Continental sources, but found it difficult to get what they required, even apart from the question of cost. Firms which were laid out for smaller production were able to get their supplies but at Increases of from twenty to thirty per cent, in cost.   Some of the foreign importers, particularly General Motors and Citroen,  professed to be very satisfied with the business they had done, and the general impression was that they had undoubtedly secured very considerable business.Mr. Bruce was reported to have said, after visiting the Motor Show, that he found that very few of the makes of cars were suitable for Australian conditions,  and to have suggested that British manufacturers should combine with a view to manufacturing or at any rate assembling, a suitable car in Australia, Sir J. Thornycroft was afraid there was little prospect of such a development, although for some time there had been a proposal to raise a large sum of money   in Australia,  to manufacture cars there.   He believed that a very considerable business was being done In Australia in manufactured parts now, because the people who produced parts In Australia had such an advantage that the makers of cars here  found it very nearly impossible to supply many of the spares required.   Fhile the majority of British oars had small high-speed engines which did. not suit Australian requirements,  there were nevertheless a number of British makes which were just as suitable as the American types, and,  in Sir John&apos;s opinion, the real reason why they had not been able to secure a large amount of business was that the Americans had so effectually dominated the Australian market and secured their position there, that, without an enormous expenditure, British makers could not really compete with them.    The British makers of commercial vehicles, also, were finding severe American competition in Australia, and it was significant that the great proportion of omnibuses running in Sydney were of American construction.Mr. Sanderson recalled that he had Already reported to the Council the fact that the manufacture of25 motor car parts had been started in Australia.     It was also true that the American trade had secured a big hold in the Dominion, and that one heard a good many oomplaints from Australia in regard to the British type of oar.   A particular study of that question was now being made by Australian representatives, and there was no doubt, Mr. Sanderson thought,  that the average Australian was very anxious to buy a British car if he could satisfy himself that it was one that suited him.
SHIPBUILDING AND MOTOR MANUFACTURE (OONTD.).Mr. Hoso remarked that year by yoar ho had onquirod of people who had ooino from all parts of South America why it was that, except just in the limited area of the towns, one never found anything but Ford oars.    The Ford oar having, to some extent, been superseded over here, he had hoped it would be so in South America also.   He had been told, however, that the Ford car was the only one they could find of the cheap variety - and the dear varieties were out of the question -which would stand running over the ground that had to be covered.    Of course they had no roads at all; they just went over the fields, and they found the Ford was the one and only cheap car practicable for this purpose.    If we could produce a oar which would meet these requirements, Mr, Hose believed it would be sold in very large quantities out there.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES.SIR PHILIP NASH considered that there had really been.no change during the last three months in the electrical manufacturing industry.    As the Council were aware, the home market for the last twelve months had been very depressed owing to the uncertainty as to the form which the Governments Electricity Legislation would finally take, and thi3 depression had been accentuated owing to the effects of the coal strike. But the Electricity Bill was now nearing, or was presumably nearing, its final stages in Parliament, and the larger Power Undertakings in the country would be bound to extend their capacity, apart from any special consideration of the effect which the Bill would have upon them, because they had very little time now in which to put themselves in a position to meet the demands of 1928.    The smaller power companies, however, and the smaller municipal undertakings, were undoubtedly holding up all extensions and all additions because they were uncertain what their position would be when the Bill had passed through Parliament.    The result was that, as regards heavy plant,  there was a very marked depression in the home marketj and there had been this for the past twelve months.Fortunately there had been, during that time, a very good export market, and Sir P, Nash had not heard of a single case where a contract had been lost to this country owing to uncertainty of delivery as a result of the coal strike. This country had obtained its full share of those good twelve months1  export business, and the result was that most of the big concerns were to-day running fairly fully, - on, however, an abnormal proportion of export over home business. Normally speaking, an electrical manufacturing company ought to run about 50-50, export and home; to-day,  the proportion was usually something like. 75-25.
ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES  (OONTD.)*As regards material, the British manufacturers were obtaining most of their material of the specialised kind from either America or Germany at the moment, because they could not obtain it in this country, and that had meant a considerable amount of loss of business to the country. The chief difficulty at present was to get heavy forgings, and that had meant imported orders for heavy forgings going to Germany, czecho-Slovakia and elsewhere.It was thought that,  generally speaking, the electrical tradees were employing about the same number of men now that they were six months ago, but they were boing employed on export orders which had been obtained under world competition. It was satisfactory at any rate that we were able to retain that amount of business for this country, although it v/ould not be of a profitable nature from the point of view of price.COTTON.SIR W. GLARE LEES wrote:-&quot;The position in Manchester is unchanged as comparod with this time last month, except for the fact that order books are running out still further.    There is a considerable amount of enquiry coming in from overseas markets, but the hoavy drop in the price of cotton has thoroughly shaken confidence, and until that is restored and the world is satisfied that values are not likely to drop further, heavy buying will not take place.&quot;Records of account sales coming home from abroad on several markets indicate that goods are being sold at prices which would allow replacement values, together with a reasonable profit, so that whilst these sales carry heavy losses on realisation they do not indicate a demoralised state in the market abroad.&quot;The position in regard to the supply of coal is getting more and more difficult.    Prices have become absolutely prohibitive, and are so.high as to destroy the possibility of profit for the time being on any business that is being done.    It is of great importance that as much &apos;home got&apos;  coal as possible should be released for Industrial purposes, otherwise a considerable increase in unemployment must take place&quot;.
WOOL.MR. ANDREWS observed that the price of Wool had fallen about fifteen per cent, in Australia, no doubt owing to the Increase in the clip, the Goal Strike in England, and the appreciation of the French franc.    A year ago the French had been keen buyers of wool because they were pretty well assured that the franc would depreciate.    This year they were afraid of the franc appreciating, and consequently were not so keen about laying in stocks.    As regards wool consumption we had, of course, no real statistics, but it was known fairly accurately what the position was.    In Germany and the United States of Amerioa the consumption was about normal; in France it was excessive, one might say very excessive; in England it was much below normal, probably forty per cent, below.    The cost of coal here was a very grave consideration for those in the textile trade, and the cost of production was very high.    It was quite impossible for this extra oost to be passed on, and consequently the trade generally was being done at a loss.    Export trade was somewhere about normal, but the home trade was very bad.    The home trade situation was due to two things; firstly, to competition from the French, who, on account of the franc, could export so much cheaper than we oould produce; secondly,  to the diminished purchasing power of our own people. The tone of the trade generally was one of very grave depression, and on the whole the outlook was likely to be very bad for the next six months.COLONEL WILLEY wrote&quot;There has been little change in employment during the past month.      The tendency is to machinery curtailment, owing to the excessively high cost of coal. The outstanding feature is continued unemployment in the worsted Weaving Branch; forward business tends continually to shrink.     fhe competition of imported fabrics, particularly from France, is devastating, their low wages and other conversion costs place them in an unassailable position. They not only have the advantage of supplying the United Kingdom market, but are making further continuous in-*roads into British trade in neutral markets.    Worsted spinners&apos; forward contracts are also very small.    Yarn exports are below normal.&quot;The repeated fall in cotton probably increases the sentimental disinclination to place forward business in Wool Textiles.     Deliveries in the Hosiery trade have been stimulated by weather conditions, but this is not sufficient to produce much new forward business in yarns&quot; .
02ARTIFICIAL    SILK.MR. ADDISON reported that the position for the last month had not shown any marked change.      The home market was still in a depressed condition;    it was especially the coal situation that was depressing everyone concerned in the trade in Lancashire.   This feeling of depression had also been largely aggravated by the big slump in American cotton. Further, a great number of the manufacturers were running very little of their machinery, and in many cases the works were closed entirely.    The only bright spot in the English trade was possibly the hosiery branch, and in Scotland the lace curtain manufacture, for the firms concerned in that trade were beginning to take an interest in artificial silk and their demand was showing a steady increase.    Conditions on the Continent were found to be very dull all through, with the exception of those in Germany where there was a big demand and prices were well maintained.    A slight demand was coming from South America, but it was rather difficult to negotiate business.    To the ordinary producer India was still a closed market, owing to the excessive Italian dumping, and the same remark would apply to China.      In Japan there had been a considerable slump, and practically no business was going through.    Of all the overseas markets it would be true to say that Australia was the brightest spot, and there was a good steady demand coming from that country.CHEMICALS.MR.PERRY wrote on 10th November:-&quot;The remarks I made in October appear to be coming true, inasmuch as the policy of carrying on by the aid of foreign coal is proving too costly, and the alternative of closing Works is now coming into force, a case in point being the J-Iond Nickel Works which closed down, and discharged about 1100 workmen, on October 26th.    There are, of course, many other smaller cases which I could   quote.    The general Impression in Chemical Industry appears to me to be that it is preferable to close down rather than attempt to make both ends meet by increasing the price of the finished article to the consumer&quot;.POTTERY.MR. HOLLINS said that the position in the Pottery industry had shown a wonderful recovery during the last three or four months and their latest unemployment figures were almost down to the level obtaining before the coal stoppage. The exports appeared from the Board of &quot;Trade returns to be down, which was largely due to the coal stoppage and the fact that the industry was behind hand in its deliveries. Prices had had to be considerably increased;    and, whilst
POTTERY    (contd.*)the potteries were busy at present, and usually were so in November and up to the middle of December, these high prices must naturally create a falling off in the demand, if they were continued.     But the manufacture of pottery had greatly increased in oost, because of the large amount of coal that was used in the firing processes.   When it was considered that from ten to fifteen tons of coal were used for every ton of product, it would be seen that a tremendous amount of fuel was required for our pottery&quot;.Two successful experiments in oil fuel were proceeding, and these were working out economically soundly, having regard to present fuel prices, but they would not be economically sound with normal prioes.    But it was hoped that a new burner could be introduced which would considerably reduce the consumption, and might bring costs down to a competitive figure with the normal price of coal.FOOD    INDUSTRIES.SIR S. MACHIN reported that in the food industries the position was undoubtedly rather better than when the Council last met.   As regards the home trade this was, as the Council was aware, a very busy season with all food industries; but generally speaking, there was now a bigger demand than there had been for some years past.   Probably this was due to the  fact that buyers who had been holding off were now unable to wait any longer to fill up their stocks.   There was, no doubt, a general revival of trade in these industries which was encouraging.   Certain districts, however, were suffering from the deepest depression, especially the North-cast coast of England and parts of South iVales.   Orders were not only not coming in from there, but forward orders given a month or two ago were being cancelled because there was found to be no demand.   The food industries sere suffering like others in London from a shortage of coal; they were carrying on under great difficulty and at great expense, but there was a feeling that when once this coal trouble was out of the way there would be a rapid and substantial revival.One very important article of food, sugar, was still in an anomalous position.   It appeared, under existing conditions, to be only a question of time before the sugar refining industry, as such, must disappear from this country.   Not only had it to compete with sugar coming from abroad made under cheaper conditions, but there was now the British-produced sugar which was being helped by the Government, although the refiners,  as such, were not being helped.
FOOD INDUSTRIES  (OONTD.).As regards foreign trade there was a fair demand,  except on the Continent.    France and Belgium had ceased to exist as a market for this country.    It was not that there was no demand for British goods.    An English company, which started a factory in France a year ago, had now increased its output by over four-fold; that showed that a demand for English goods still existed, and if the Tariff barrier could bo overcome,  could be met and increased.The propaganda in favour of British foodstuffs,  etc, was having, Sir S. Machin thought,  a certain effect,  though perhaps not a very marked one.    It had been found that some of our biggest distributors were giving more prominence to Empire foodstuffs, including fruit.    They were prepared to continue,  but the overseas suppliers would have to study more closely what was wanted in this market; and they should, by some means, be brought more into contact with the big distributors and really get at what our trade required.    The distributors would not take tho trouble to push things which were not marketable and which the trade was not accustomed to.    It was a question of right study and attention to detail.SCOTTISH CO-OPERATIVE WHOLESALE SOCIETY, LTD. MR. GALL ACKER wrote&quot;Business is still very quiet with the Scottish Co-operative Yftiolesale Society,  though we registered a slight increase of  5,069,1,10d. for tho week ending 23rd October,  as compared with the corresponding week last year.    This increase,  the first since the half-year began in July last, is due to increased sales in the Grocery and Boot Departments.    We are still showing decreases in the Drapery and Furnishing Departments.&quot;Our debts due to us from our Shareholding Societies show an enormous increase, being  993,064 as against  550,852 at the same period last yoar.    This is due to the scarcity of money among the retail Societies, arising from the stoppage in the mining industry. As time goes on this tendency to increased indebtedness to the Wholesale Society is becoming very marked indeed.&quot;Our productive departments are very quiet, particularly our tweed, blanket, and clothing factories;  and our Cabinet Factory is also running short time.    We have little prospect of any increase in these departments while the dispute continues.&quot;We have been compelled to instal,  in several of our factories,  oil-burning apparatus because of the uncertainty of coal supplies and the heavy increased costs,  due to the high price of coal.    This week&apos;s coal supplies have been much better, but the price is almost prohibitive.    For 17 weeks our total decrease in sales averages about 8fo.&quot;
GENERAL    TRADE-MR. VYLE said that the general feeling,  as far as could he seen from the reports received from the Chambers of Commerce, was that the position since the Council meeting a month ago had somewhat deteriorated.    There was,  however,  a certain amount of optimism about, but it was doubtful whether this was well founded. Mr. Vyle wished to support what Sir Arthur Balfour had said, -that the manufacturing industries of this country had paid such a colossal price for the purpose of getting an economic settlement of the coal dispute, that they hoped nothing would be allowed to prevent such a settlement.Taking the reports from a few of the towns,  it was noticed that Aberdeen stated that the fish trade was much affected by lack of coal,  and one-third of their local floet was idle; the situation in their shipbuilding (they built small ships) showed signs of improvement, but the coal strike was creating a great difficulty in regard to material.   The same thing was occurring on the engineering side,  the question of material was a great difficulty; they could not get delivery. Greenock reported the same thing, and also that those firms which had ordered foreign steel could not get satisfactory delivery. As to the sugar refineries,  the action which the President of the Board of Trade took in looking into their coal difficulties was much appreciated.    It was a question both of shortage and price.    It appeared that now all the Clyde refiners had ceased turning out refined sugar, owing to the scarcity and prohibitive cost of coal.    In Hull the coal strike was making it very difficult to express any optimistic note as to future trade. Supplios of imported cereals were ample, but in the manufacturing trades there was no improvement, and the export trade was poor.Leicester reported that there was an improvement in their boot industry - chiefly in an increased demand for Russian-style boots, - and that the hosiery trade was being stimulated by the cold weather.    Liverpool said that there was a marked change in the conditions operating in the timber trade; freights on spruce deals from Canada had advanced from 65/- to 95/- a standard; there was still a demand for all varieties of timber except pit wood, but the price was likely to be very high indeed. Birmingham&apos;s report was to the effect that the chief trouble was with the heavy engineering trades there;  they could not get their supplies.    The motor trades had some hope of good business as a result of the recent Show,  and the jewellory trades were having their usual seasonal demands for Christmas.   Wolverhampton reported much to the same effect.The only thoroughly bright spot appeared to be Southampton, where they recorded that they had had a most successful month in October.    There was every indication that the American fruit season would be a record one; and the seasonal fruit trade carried on between this port and Spain was also very heavy.    The tomato traffic with the Channel Islands had been almost a record, averaging between 30,000 and 40,000 packages daily.    They also reported a developing traffic with the Dutch East Indies which had necessitated the provision of newer and larger vessels.
GENERAL TRADE AND FINANCE.SIR MAX MUSPRATT wrote:-&quot;The continuance of the coal stoppage into the season of the year when under normal conditions trade receives its main impetus for the new year means, that when it comes, the recovery from the stoppage will be both very much slower and more limited in its scope than it would have been reasonable to anticipate with an earlier termination of the dispute.   In addition, our adverse trade balance and the financial position generally give grounds for serious apprehension, so that it is almost impossible to avoid the conclusion that we are moving towards a situation which may involve certain of our basic industries is little short of disaster.&quot;SIR FELIX SCHUSTER observed that the trading reports from the various branches of the National Provincial Bank gave the same indication as the authoritative statements made by the members of the Council.There seemed to be an underlying current of optimism In various quarters; and although business was very slack and we were having bad times just now, there was the hope, which one trusted was justified, that when the coal strike came to an end there would be business in sight.   Orders were reported from various quarters to be in hand for future business.   How far they would materialize remained, of course, to be seen.As regards the monetary position, the situation was very much the same as at last month.   There was,, Sir F.Schuster thought, an almost undue feeling of optimism on the Stock Exchange, and certain factors did not seem to be sufficiently recognised.   Personally, he could not see that there was likely to be any ease In the Money Market for some time to come.   The demand for investments and new issues seemed to be increasing. The success of the Belgian Loan which was recently issued had been absolutely phenominal and indicated a desire on the part of the big Trust Companies, Insurance Companies and others, to invest money abroad.   He was disposed to anticipate that in some of our most important industrial establishments there would be some capital reconstruction and demand for new capital, which certainly - as was indicated by the reports of the Banks and the Increase in the ratio of advances to their deposits - the Banks would not be In a very good condition to meet, and the public would have to be asked to find the money   for the new capital required in our home industries. Then, the effect of the Budget and the possibility, the probability one might almost say - of increased taxation was not yet sufficiently recognised.   The Money Market would show that more clearly in the early months of the New Year than it did at
GENERAL TRADE AND FINANCE  (CONTD.)the present moment.   Further, the way In which the Increased Imports and decreased exports were being met had not yet made itself sufficiently felt. It was rather concealed. There were certain indications that American money, which had been withdrawn from this market, was coming back rather freely at the present timec   The deposits of Amerioan Banks in this market were increasing, and these also of other foreign Banks.   The effect on the Stock Exchange which Increased imports would no doubt otherwise have produced was thus concealed, but they would make themselves felt in time, and it could only be repeated that for some while to come one could not see any great ease In the Money Market. The present rates were not very high, but Industry must make up its mind that It could not look forward to an easy market for some time.MR CURRIE said that the rates of money were being well maintained.   He agreed with Sir Felix Schuster in seeing no ease In the immediate future or even for a long time ahead. The rate of withdrawals compared with deposits had certainly gone up and he thought that the Banks would find It difficult to provide the money required when industry got going again.   Probably the public did not quite realise the position, and he was afraid they might have rather a rude awakening when it developed.   He could not say that the outlook was at all hopeful.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.MR HTJRCOMB observed that the gross traffic receipts of the railways were naturally suffering very much from the continuance of the coal dispute and the consequent shutting down of the heavier Industrieso The published traffic receipts for the four weeks ending 24th October showed a decline of  2,400,000, as compared with the corresponding four weeks in last year.   Of that decline about half a million sterling was in passenger traffic, and the balance of  1,900,000 in goods traffic    As regards the actual fall in the tonnage of the goods traffic, the latest detailed figures available were those for August, and they showed a decline, as compared with August last year,, of thirteen per cent in general merchandisej of seventy-two per cent in coal and of thirty-four per cent in other minerals, For the whole year to the end of August the decline in tonnage, as compared with the corresponding period in 1925, was about ten per cent, for general merchandise; about -twenty per cent, for other minerals, and thirty-eight per cent, for coal.
S8EMPLOYMENT.MR. PHILLIPS said that at the beginning of October there was a considerable increase in the unemployment total, amounting to about 45,000,  largely due to Increased short-time working in the cotton trade.   During the three remaining weeks, however   there had been reductions, and at the end of October the total&apos;was just over 1,500,000,  the lowest figure since the beginning of the coal dispute,  - although,  of course,  it was still serious enough particularly as this figure did not include any of the coalminers who were actually in the dispute.CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES.MR. BRAND wrote on 29th October: -&quot;I have been in the United States for the last two months, and only returned two days ago,  and am therefore unable to express any opinion on European conditions.   Perhaps, however,  the following very general impressions of the American situation may be of interest.&quot;It is not easy to form s judgment of the industrial and financial developments there in the next six months.   After hearing the views of a great number of bankers and others, my opinion is that there is not likely to be any serious or prolonged slump or depression there.   Speculation in real estate is considered to have been very much over-done In a great many parts of the country, and - In the big cities - building as well. Furthermore,  purchasing by instalments is also considered to have been developed so far that it might form a serious danger in a period of depression.   In addition,  the very big diminution in the purchasing power of the cotton districts,  owing to the slump in cotton,  together with the not very good farming position in certain other sections may produce some curtailment of business.   But in general the industrial situation appears to be sound.   The credit machinery of the country is not over-strained, and the big industrial companies are enormously powerful in their holdings of cash and liquid securities.    Loans against Stock Exchange securities and banks&apos; investments in securities are comparatively high, but while there may well be a stop to the continued appreciation of securities,  it is not likely that there will be any very severe collapse,&quot;The impression New York makes upon one is,  of course,  that it is now by far the greatest capital market in the world.     Its internal Investment market has grown immensely, and even In foreign issues it far outstrips London at present.    Money is cheaper in New York than London, and therefore a lot of business which might otherwise come to London is naturally attracted there. American investors at the moment aotually favour foreign issues as against home issues owing to the higher rate on capital that they give.    It is recognised, however, that America cannot go on lending enormously to foreign countries without becoming a much greater importing country than she is at present.
CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES (OONTD.)&quot;When I was in Washington Mr. Hoover showed me some striking figures of the great increase in real wages in America in the last ten years or so as compared with the stationary position in this respect in England.     He attributed this improvement in the main to what he regarded as the extraordinary Increase in efficiency in producing wealth, which was due largely to much greater co-operation in searching for all possible economies among the producers in the various industries and trades.&quot;I heard on many sides that the relations between capital and labour were better than they had been for many years..   If I may say so, the great difference as it strikes me in this ree-fftct between England and America is that there, however different tmy. be their views, both capital and labour accept the present system of society and co-operate In working it, with . really remarkable results.   I was struck further by the fact that the great industries in America, such as the chemical, electrical and steel industries, are now, just as in the case of Germany, formed into a few great units, which oan readily negotiate Amer&apos;lcan--&amp;er*jan international agreements.   On the other hand, when It comes to Great Britain, they find no similar concerns with which, they- t?an negotiate.   I notice Sir Alfred Mond laid stress on this as one of the reasons for the proposed chemical merger in this country. I regard it myself as a very important reason,&quot;AUSTRALIAN ,TRADE,MR, SANDERSON stated that there had been some further- good, rains in the drought areas;   but it was just the time of year when temperatures up in that part of the country were rather highj ard, unless they got further good falls of rain, the rains which has already taken place would not be of real service.   There had also been good rains over some of the sugar areas in Queensland, and the wheat prospects In the Maranoa had improved, but still they were not very good.    Further south the position was, generally, very good indeed both from the pastoral and agricultural points of v**ew.   The wool clip which was now being sold, should be very good, although during the last month values had fallen.     The lambing percentage was very satisfactory, so far as present information went,Vheat prospects, of course, at this time of year were always the subject of optimism or pessimism, according as one looked at them, but it seemed that, even if advene weather conditions occurred, the wheat crop must be quite as good as,  and probably better than, any recent crop there had been in Australia.   One heard In some quarters very sanguine estimates made of the yield, and,., of course, if weather conditions proved good they might have a bumper harvest.
INDIAN TRADE.MR. LINDSAY reported that the present position, on the whole, waa satisfactory.    He had observed at the last meeting of the Council that the Cotton crop did not seem to be working out very well, but later indications were rather more favourable.    The Council were aware that the Tariff Board which, had been directed to enquire into the cotton industry in India was proceeding with its enquiries, and would probably report towards the end of the year. One aspect of that, enquiry which had to be taken into consideration was the extent of Japanese purchases of cotton from India.      Japan was, of course, selling an increasing quantity of cotton piece goods to India, but these were far exceeded in value by Japanese purchases of raw cotton from India.      India counted on an output of about 6 million bales a year.    The Indian cotton mills took about 1 million bales of short staple, and 1 million bales of long staple.     There remained a balance of 3 million bales of short staple, and 1 million bales of long staple.    There was no difficulty in finding a market for their long staple cotton, but they had great difficulty in finding a market for the 3 million bales of short staple which averaged between, say, 5/8&quot; and I&quot;.    Japan was the great market for Indian cotton of this grade, and of course japan&apos;s purchasing power depended on her sales of cotton piece goods in the Indian market.    The balance of trade as between Japan and India was very much in the latter&apos;s favour, that is to say the value of the raw cotton which Japan bought from India was far greater than that of the cotton piece goods which she sold to India.    This was bound to be a consideration which would weigh with the Indian Tariff Board in considering the request of the Bombay mills for protection against Japan.As regards tea, the Food Council&apos;s report on wholesale prices of tea had recently been published, and the action of the Indian Tea Association in restricting, or rather controlling output had been somewhat adversely commented on. Now the tea position had entirely changed since the end of the war.    In the earlier years after the war, 1919/1920, large quantities of common tea had been put on the market, and it was found that they could not be sold.    The taste for the finer classes of tea had enormously extended, and the Food Council themselves evidently recognised that the most popular tea at present was of a quality which fetched about 2/4d to 2/8d. a pound retail, a high grade of tea. One oould not, however, have it both ways;    one could not both maintain the output of tea and increase its quality. The higher grades of tea could only be increased at the expense of quantity.    It meant plucking finer, plucking the crop in a less mature stage, and therefore producing a less weight of tea.    To recognise, as was done on the one hand,  that finer tea was demanded in this market, but at the same time to require a greater output in weight, was simply to be inconsistent.The tea position generally was very largely affected by the reduction of output from China.    If we compared the output nowadays with that before the war, it would be found-IS-
CONFIDENTIAL.71INDIAN    TRADE    (OONTD.)that Ceylon was producing slightly more, that Java and Japan were both producing more, and that India was producing considerably more, but that these increases were very largely set off by the reduction in output from China, and that if it was not for the reduction of the demand from Russia, the general demand for tea would be much keener than it was at present.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.MR. HOSE said that in the Argentine they had had a rather severe frost, and this would lessen the wheat crop, especially;    but as that crop would probably compare favourably with the very bad crop last year, we might have on balanoe something better than we had then.There had been a great increase in the production of petroleum In certain districts.    The oil wells belonged principally to the railways and to the Government, and the railways had naturally converted considerably to oil fuel; and it was rather anticipated that they were not likely to go back to coal very extensively if the strike here prevented them very much longer from getting cargoes.    The same remark applied to Chilian Railways, for contracts could be made for oil at prioes which were much less than the corresponding cost of coal, having regard to the work which each kind of fuel would do;    and there might well be a lessened demand for coal all over South America in future, if the strike cont continued.Chile had just lately had a rather serious political disturbance, which had been patched up, but only temporarily, and there might therefore possibly be some further trouble. It was rather curious that at the time when this was in progress the Chilean Government were able to raise thirteen million pounds in loan in America.    It was true there were bids for it from England.    The Banco Central de Chile was answering its purpose well, and the exchange remained practically stationary which was a great help to trade. A new Customs tariff was being considered, to protect their local industries which were increasing.    In the nitrate situation there was no change, and it was creating consider-able uneasiness.In Brazil trade was disorganised and the commercial position, especially in San Paolo, was most unsatisfactory. The President had hinted that they would not convert or stabilise the pesa at 8d, probably it would be at 6d.. and in the meantime the uncertainty was having the usual effects. As to Peru there was little to be said.   The exchanges were a trifle worse, and they were now paying thirty-six per cent, premium for sovereigns.    It was a truism to say that one could get permanent recovery by strict economies, but what was the good of talking of strict economies in connection with Peru?TRADE IN CHINA.MR.*; LANDALE stated that business generally was...stlll very restricted in China, owing to the prevailing unsettled state of the count--&quot;     The fall in the price of cotton and
TRADE IN CHINA (CONTD.)Silver had. interfered very much with import orders for Lancashire goods and machinery, and there was also very little doing in exports from China.    As regards business in the South of China, it was very uncertain whether the boycott of British goods had really been put an end to or not, and Chinese merchants were very nervous about handling British goods or shipments by British steamers.    British steamers were trying to arrange to recommence business with Swatow and Canton, but so far with little success.   British ships generally on the coast of China were still losing money.In the absence of a responsible Government, the whole Railway system in China was continuing to be dominated by the Military.    When the railways were not being used for troop movements the recovery of the traffic was remarkable, in spite of the bad condition of rolling stock and equipment. Of the British-financed Railways, the following Loan Services were in default, both as regards repayment of principal and of interest:-   Tientsin Pukow Railway Loan of 1908, and Supplementary Loan Account;    Canton Kowloon Railway Loan of 1907;    and Hukuang Railways Loan of 1911, Hankow-Canton Section.

Statement made at the meeting of the Advisory Committee to the Department of Overseas Trade held on Wednesday,  the 20th _October,  1926, regarding the export trade position.__MR&apos;.  vYLE  (Hardware and Metals) wrote: -&quot;The prolongation of the coal dispute is making business generally more and more difficult.      Supplies of foreign coal to industry do not seem to be so easily available as they were, though the Increased production of English coal may soon corn-pens ate for this .&quot;Forward contracts are difficult to make at competitive prices when the cost of coal In the future is so uncertain. Forward contracts for the supply of coal are not being made for tho seme reason,  and It is a paramount necessity as speedily as possible to destroy the present sense of insecurity and uncertainty that exists .&quot;A few firms here and there are fully employed and. are apparently prosperous.     Of the others who have not been closed down through want of coal,  a large number are on short time and others are finding It exceedingly difficult to obtain the necessary component parts to complete their productions. It often happens that orders of considerable value are unable to be sent a\*/ay because of the lack of some small component worth only a few shillings, but which is unobtainable at the present time.      The prices of these under-produced eomponents are very unstable,  and. fluctuate from day to day.&quot;In some quarters there is a more hopeful atmosphere with export business,  substantial orders having been, confirmed quite unexpectedly.&quot;MR. J. GRAY. BUCHANAN (Iron and Steel, Metals,  Indian Merchant Trade) also wrote :-&quot;Business in iron and steel is abnormal at present,  and makers&apos;  stocks in this country have now dwindled, away to almost nothing.     Fancy prices are now being asked, for what little remains,  and most of the makers have been fortunate in getting rid of their off-grade pig-iron and also their stocks of old steel plates,  so that the position Is now clear for a fresh start.      So far as we can learn,  and from cur own experience, all works have fair-sized order-books which will keep them busy for several months after business is resumed,  and in many cases buyers abroad are holding up their orders,  as during the past few weeks there has been considerable reluctance on the part of manufacturers here to quote prices for delivery after the strike,  as it is difficult for them to tell what their costs may be.&quot;As regards iron and. steel for export,  India seems to be nearing the end of a long period of depression,  and there are signs of fresh business coming along.      The Straits Settlements is a promising market In view of the greatly enhanced price of tin and the very profitable figure fixed for rubber.&quot;Our/
&quot;Our news from. Russia is very favourable indeed with regard to her influence as a consumer of raw products,  and this will undoubtedly benefit our customers abroad who produce this raw material which Russia requires&quot;&apos;1 .MR.  HICHENS  (Shipbuilding,   Iron and Steel) .Mr. HiChens stated that as regards the steel industry the outlook was gloomy and uncertain.    The finances of the industry were in a poor condition before the strike commenced and many works had been closed since May.    He referred to the arrangement which had recently been concluded between the steel industries of Germany, France, Belgium and Luxemburg to control the output of steel.    The question of whether this country should enter the cartel was a very difficult one, which would require the most careful consideration.. He thought the immediate effect of the establishment of the cartel might be helpful to British industry by putting up prices on the Continent.      He referred to the formation in Germany of a large steel trust controlling 40 per cent of the steel producing capacity of the country,  and stated that the policy of the German industrialists was to eliminate all inefficient works. In reply to the Chairman, he expressed the opinion that the United States manufacturers were not in a position to manufac-ture so cheaply as our own steel works .   He said that unforttmate ly when American steel making firms desired to obtain a parti-cular piece of business they seemed to quote prices quite irrespective of the  cost.      In this country the capacity for steel production which had grown from approximately 7,000,000 tons to 12,000,000 tons at the present time was too great, for present and. immediate future demands.    The ideal condition was, of course,  to have a productive capacity slightly less than the actual demand.      He thought that something should be done in this country with a view to the elimination of obsolete and inefficient works,As regards shipbuilding,  a great many of the orders could only be executed at the present time by the use of foreign steel.MR. ROWLAND  (Agricultural Machinery).Mr. Rowland stated that the strike had had very little effect so far on the agricultural engineering industry, but a lack of confidence had been noticeable lately in a diminution of orders and the situation was serious .    He had noticed in several markets that British manufacturers were competing against each other;    his association had recently been considering the Indian market in the same manner as they had tackled the Argentine market, where, he was pleased to say,  the prospects were favourable and the balance of the credit granted by the Export Credits Guarantee Department would, he expected, be taken up within a very short time.    As regards India, he proposed to approach his competitors with a view to establishing a joint sales organisation.    There would he no amalgamation financially, but it was hoped to introduce co-operation in marketing in place of cut-throat competition.MR./
MR. FYBUS (Electrical Engineering) .Mr. Pybus, speaking generally for the electrical industry, stated that little alteration had occurred since his last report.    Prices were, however,  now keener abroad and the delay in settling the Electricity Bill was holding up home orders. The South African and Indian Railways had placed quite good electrical business in the country.    The coal stoppage had not materially affected output.As regards Russia, he referred to the Technical Commission recently sent to this country for the purpose of interesting British firms in the turbine requirements of the Soviet.    It appeared that four1 of the principal manufacturers engaged in the production of heavy plant had been approached,  but the conditions laid down as to credit were such that only one of the firms could see their way to accepting the business.    The terms offered were 15 per cent with order and the balance in 1928,  six months after delivery.SIR GEORGE SUTTON (Cable Industry) .Sir George Sutton,  speaking of the electric cable industry, which was a well organised trade,  said that prices were not so good in Australia as in New Zealand.    It had to be admitted that much of the Australian business was unprofitable, but the orders were taken with a view to the maintenance of work.      The chief competitors in the cable trade were Germany, Belgium and France.    In South America certain competition was encountered from United States manufacturers, but not elsewhere. He pointed out that since the war the output per head of the workmen in the cable trade had been continually on the Increase. Generally speaking, his branch of the electrical industry was In a sound position.MR. HOLROYD (Cotton Spinning).Mr. Holroyd was not very encouraging in regard to his section of the cotton trade.    Some months ago the view was held that if the price of cotton fell to l/- important business would result, but actually the price was as low as 7d.,  and trade was very bad.    Probably the cause of this was that people were waiting for the bottom of the market to be reached.    The fall in the price of silver had also had a bad effect on their Eastern trade.    The strike had not greatly affected the American Section,  since they were only producing to 50/o of capacity and they had been able to get enough coal for this.    Curiously enough, the coarse section of the trade was the most successful, even though India and Japan were best able to compete in the low counts.MR. LEE  (Cotton Yarns ) .Mr. Lee took the view that the fall in the price of cotton had not yet had its full effect,  but that orders would be forth-coming shortly.    He intimated that in. the coarse section they were working 50% and in the fine  section 85 to 90% of capacity, but unfortunately any profits there might have been were being absorbed by the high price that had to be paid for foreign coal.MR ./
MR../MR.  PARKER  (Boots and Shoes).Mr. Parker stated with reference to the boot and shoe-industry that production had not suffered directly through the strike,  though naturally the purchasing power in this country was affected.    The industry was working to 75% of capacity. As regards overseas trade,  the situation was as he reported, at the last meeting,  that the Dominions had in many cases established their own industries and in Australia the market 7,:as practically a closed one,      In New Zealand there was a demand for British goods and In South Africa they were able to hold their own.     An interesting fact was that there was a steady,   and he thought, increasing demand from the United States,  though probably it would not assume very large dimensions.MR. JOHNSTON (Pottery).Kr % Johnston reported that the pottery trade had suffered very greatly from the effects of the  coal stoppage,  since the price of foreign coal was&apos; almost prohibitive .    It must be remembered that coal represented 10% of the cost and the high prices that were being paid meant an   addition of 15/1 on the selling prices.    He also referred to the fact that the anti-dumping laws which existed in certain overseas markets were increasing the difficulties of doing trade .    In the sanitary trade, which at- one time was practically the monopoly of this country,  competition was now being experienced from Germany, Czechoslovakia and Japan.      He mentioned that the Germans had formed a cartel,  and had now approached British producers with a view to coming to an arrangement to avoid cutting prices. The proposal had not,  so far, been received, with favour,  although he thought that it was worthy of consideration from every point of view.    He referred to the fact that in Czechoslovakia a skilled, worker was being paid 4/3d. per day as against 12/-received by the British worker, while unskilled labour was paid at the rate of 18/- per week,  as&apos;,against 48/-.COLONEL COLE  (Motor and Cycle Industry).Colonel Cole stated that the strike had caused great touble in the motor industry.    In Coventry there were now 6/7,000 unemployed as compared, with 3,000 In. 1923 in the period of depression.    Early this year the output showed, an increase on that of last year,  but since the industrial trouble, prospects were uncertain,  due in the main to reduction of purchasing power. This particularly referred to the less cheap cars.    As to over-seas markets,   the business in Australia was complicated by the tariff provisions which favoured, the importation of parts for assembly as against the shipment of complete cars.      In India the heavy stocks of American cars accumulated three or four years ago had in the main been disposed of,  and. he was glad to say that the bicycle trade with that country was in better shape. Generally speaking,  the motor cycle trade was in a fairly good condition, but in relation to all the products in which he was interested uncertainty of delivery of raw materials and auxiliary parts was seriously affecting the position.
COMFIDEHTIAL.MR. DO DWELL (China Merchant Trade).Mr. Dodwell said that he had little Information to give with regard to China beyond what had already- appeared in the press.    The situation changed from hour to hour, but at the present moment it was not possible to discern signs of improve-ment.    In fact, business had dwindled considerably since his last report at the end of May.    The boycott in Canton had been officially removed, but there was no evidence that trade in British goods with British merchants was being resumed,  and probably the lifting of the boycott was merely official.    He also referred to the question of the excess duties levied by the Canton Government as an offset to the removal of the boycott, which was one of extreme difficulty for the International Powers .As regards Shanghai,  trade had been disastrously affected by the operations of Chang Kai Shek in the Yangtsze Valley. It was not possible to hazard an opinion as to whether he would succeed against Sun Chuan Fang.The general trade had been seriously affected by the coal strike andthe heavy drop in the price of cotton and silver,-the Tael in Shanghai having fallen from 5/3d... to 2/4 d .
