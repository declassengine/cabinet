I circulate for consideration by my colleagues the Report of an inter-Departmental Conference on the question whether any further legislative or other Government action is desirable to roduce danger to the public from the failure of reservoirs. The matter has been brought into some prominence and has been tho subject of several Parliamentary Questions in view of the disaster at Dolgarrog, in Carnarvonshire, last year.The opinion is expressed in the Report that the public are entitled to more definite safeguards for ensuring that reservoir owners obtain and act upon good expert advice both as to the construction and as to the maintenance of their works and recommendations are made to this ond for strengthening the law without involving administrative intervention by Government Departments, to whioh there would bo weighty objections.I would suggest that tho Cabinet should authorize the drafting of a Bill on the lines indicated as a basis of negotiation with the engineering profossion and other parties interest stod.W.J.H.2SndDecember,  1926.(This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government). .424(26) .0 A B I N E T.I/OSECURITY UE RESERVOIRS.

REPORT OF AN  INTER-DEPARTMENTAL CONFERENCE ON the safety OF RESERVOIRS.0t and The object of the Conference was to consider whether any, and if soi u 10 .    wjjat, further legislative or other Government action would be desirable to reduce danger to the public from the escape of large quantities of water from reservoirs.    The Departments represented were the Home Office, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Transport and Electricity Commissioners, and Board of Trade.    The Home Office is concerned as dealing with the safety of the public except in so far as some other Department has specific jurisdiction;    the Ministry of Health is the Central Authority ooncerned with water supply;    the Ministry of Transport and the Electricity Commissioners are interested in the storage of water power for generating electricity and for canals;    while the Board of Trade is concerned with water power in its economic aspects, and to a minor extent because it still has a small residue of its former powers (most of which have been transferred to the Home Office and Ministry of Transport) for ordering inquiries into accidents.in of 2,    The Conference was arranged in view of tho events following a seriouserenco.disaster which had occurred in North Wales in November, 1925.    A dam at Lake (or Llyn) Eigiau, in the Carnarvonshire Mountains, burst;    over a million cubic feet of water wore precipitated on to    a smaller reservoir below (Lake Coety), a dam at the lower end of which also gave way, and the mass of water rushed down the valley on to tho village of Dolgarrog, doing very considerable damage.    Sixteen lives were lost, and but for fortunate circumstances the casualties would have been very much greater.    These dams belonged to a private industrial concern (the Aluminium Corporation Ltd.) and had been constructed within the previous twenty years.    The consulting engineers and building contractors appear to have been firms of good standing, but it transpired at the Inquest that some partjr or parties had been seriously in default in connection with the construction of the upper dam.    The disaster was partly due to the foundations of the dam not having been carried sufficiently deep so that the water burst through underneath it;    but the dam was unsatisfactory in other respects also - in particular,  the concrete was of poor quality.    The Coroner&apos;s jury recommended examination of the dam by a Government expert before re-construction and &quot;that Government Inspection should be regularly made of dams as is done with other Public Services&quot;.3.    The Aluminium Corporation and a closely associated Company, the North Wales Power Company, which supplied electricity for public lighting and other purposes,  owned a number of dams in the neighbourhood and after the Inquest the Home Offioe, in consultation with the other Departments, arranged for the Companies to have an investigation made into these by an independent firm of Engineers.    The firm selected (with Government approval) were Messrs. Sir Alexander Gibb &amp; Partners,  and their
Jed extent iresent 1 and   . &quot;nistrative fvention.Report recommends that   various works of greater or less magnitude should be carried out in the interests of public safety at each dam which they have inspected.    The Companies have informed the Home Office that they propose to carry out these recommendations except that? instead of undertaking the extensive measures which would be required at the Eigiau Dam, they propose to store water only up to a lower level and carry out some minor works which nay be necessary for that purpose.   Messrs Gibb have advised the Corporation that this would be safe and have been engaged by them to supervise the new works at the various dams.    The Report has not been published as there ia no evidence of sufficient demand to justify the expense;    but a copy Las been placed in the House of Commons Library, and extracts have appeared in the Press--V.    The main legal safeguard against defective reservoirs is the Common Law liability cf reservoir owners for damages in the event of an escape of water involving injury to the persons or property of others.    In the case of non-statutory undertakings it is not necessary to prove negligence and the owner cannot avoid liability unless he can show that the escape was due to the plaintiff&apos;s default or to the malicious action of a third party or to an &quot;act of God&quot;, against whioh he could not reasonably be expected to provide-.    In the case of statutory undertakings the position is somewhat different - it is usually necessary to prove negligence exoept in some cases where a special clause has been inserted in the Statute which has the effect of preserving the Common Law liability of the owner..   No such clause is, however,  contained in the Public Health Acts,  under which many water undertakings are carried on-5,    Mention may also be made of two statutory provisions of a general character.    The Water Works Clauses Act,  1863,  contains provisions enabling two Justices of the Peace, if satisfied that a reservoir is in a dangerous state, tc order the water to be lowered in the reservoir and/or the execution cf such works as they may think requisite for removing the danger.    It would appearhowever, that these powers have never been exercised.    Then, Section 53 of the Public Health Act, 1875, enables any person affected by a proposal to construct a reservoir which will hold more than one hundred thousand  gallons of water to call for the inter-vention of the Ministry of Health, who may, after enquiry,  disallow or allow, with such modifications as they deem necessary, the intended work. This section might-, no doubt, be invoked in the interests of safetjr, but it will be observed that it only applies in a case of construction. Moreover both the foregoing provisions apply only to reservoirs for water supply.6.    In the administrative sphere tho Ministry of Health investigate fully the design and engineering aspects of proposed public water supply works when they are asked to sanction loans for these under the Public Health or special Acts? and they satisfy themselves that the design,  etc. are satisfactory before giving sanction to the loan;    it has also been their practice since 19R2 to report to Parliament on the plans which are deposited by the promoters of Private Bills authorising such works,  but these plans are ordinarily in broad outline only and do not show the details
It -3. 347of construction.    The Ministry have, however, no specific authority in either of these oases to supervise the actual construction of the works or to secure that they are constructed in strict accordance with the original plans and are adequately maintained;    the responsibility in these matters rests with the undertakers.   Moreover, they do not exercise the above functions in relation to works for private water supply or for water power only.7. The Electricity Commissioners are advised that their powers under the Electricity Supply &quot;Acts do not extend over the reservoirs from which the Generating Stations obtain water.8.    Tho question of strengthening the law in connection with the safety of reservoirs was considered after a serious disaster from the bursting of a reservoir which occurred at Sheffield in 1864, and which appears to have been the last such disaster in this country involving heavy loss of life-At about the same time, certain reservoirs at Bradford and elsewhere gave rise to considerable anxiety and were inspected by an engineer appointed by the Home Seoretary, who endeavoured to persuade the water undertakers to adopt proper precautions.    The Reports and correspondence are published in the Parliamentary Papers.    In 1865, the Government introduced a Bill to strengthen the civil law in some respects in the interest of public safety, but a Select Committee on the Bill reported that much more drastic measures were required (Paper 401), and in the following year another Government Bill was introduced providing for extensive Government supervision of reservoirs; this Bill was dropped towards the end of the Session after a good deal of discussion in Committee^fflds for 9o    The Dolgarrog disaster has again raised the question, and althoughlerinment the action now proposed by the Aluminium Corporation should serve to reassureion.the inhabitants of the valleys below the particular group of dams investigated, the fact that Messrs Gibb have found that some works are necessary in the interests of public safety at every one of those dams is disturbing.   Moreover there is good reason for thinking that some other dams would be found to be defective if a close investigation were made and in view of the extensive damage which may in some localities be caused by the bursting of a dam, any suspicion of danger, whether well founded or not, is liable to give rise to considerable public alarm.   Major Owen, M.P. for Carnarvonshire, contemplates introducing a Private Member&apos;s Bill on this subject.    Another consideration   is that the storage of water in hilly districts for power and other purposes is on the increase.    We think the public are entitled to more definite safeguards for ensuring that reservoir owners obtain and act upon good expert advice both as to the construction and as to the maintenance of their works.Spot 10.    We first considered whether the owners    Common Law liability forRiveslp damages should not be emphasised and applied without limitation tonuisances &amp;o. to all Statutory Undertakings.    The position under the existing law is not satisfactory and the Statutes are not always consistent&apos;. In the oase of some Special Acts which authorize the construction or extension of large reservoirs there is no provision making the owners
liable for damages;    in other oases the owners are made liable, in some instances for any damage which nay be oaused, and in other instances for any damage which may be caused to particular interests.    There is prima facie a strong case for placing all statutory undertakings under the same liability for any damage resulting from the failure of their reservoirs as non-statutory undertakings.11.    It was further considered whether owners should be compelled to insure against their liabilities.    This proposal has certain attractions since it involves no direct Government interference with the construction and maintenance of the reservoirs - the basis of the proposal being the assumption that the Insurance Companies would carry on the business on the same lines as Boiler Insurance Companies have done.    After careful examination,, however, we have come to the conclusion that the proposal is open to considerable objection and would, probablir not attain the object in view.    It seems unlikely that Insurance Companies would institute an adequate system of independent inspection of reservoirs, in view of the relatively small amount of this particular class of business;    nor would it seem possible to encourage carefulness on the part of the owners by granting preferential rates of premium, since there could hardly be a standard rate of premium on which to base them - in the case of reservoirs the risk varies very greatly with the nature and population of the area which might be flooded, and there is no means of gauging it with any accuracy.    On the other hand there is the danger that a number of insurers would undertake the risk at a relatively low rate of premium on a speculative basis, and that the effect of insurance on the owner of the reservoir would simply be to lessen his sense of responsibility.   A further serious objection is that many of the Undertakers concerned are important public authorities who, like the Government itself, are in a position t6 meet their liabilities without incurring the cost of insurance.   It might therefore be argued that to bring in the Insurance Companies in this way would be to impose on Undertakers an additional financial burden which is not needed to achieve the object in view.IS.   We next considered a group of proposals involving G-overnment inter-vention on the technical side.    These were, for example, that the approval of the Ministry of Health should be required for raising the water level above that for which the reservoir or dam was originally designed, or for interfering with the efficiency of the means of discharge of flood waters; that the Ministry should have power after inquiry to order the owner of a reservoir oertified unsafe by a competent engineer to make any necessary alterations or repairs, and to keep the reservoir wholly or partly empty in the meantime;    and that as regards proposals for new reservoirs the promoters should in the oase of all large reservoirs, whether constructed or financed under special statutory authority or not, be required to deposit detailed plans and particulars of the design &amp;o. with the Ministry of Health, whose sanotion to the commencement of the work should be required,  and who might have power to order any modifications of the proposals deemed necessary in the interests of safety.
feposals for pervi si on and gpection by llified Lpeers.13.    Proposals on these lines would involve the transfer to the G-overnment of a considerable amount of responsibility and much of it would be of a technical kind which it has not assumed as regards, for example, the construction or extension of mines;  bridges and various other engineering works which may affect the safety of the public;    and after careful consideration we cannot recommend Government intervention to theextent contemplated by such proposals,re note that in certain cases,e.g. where the question of a loa.n arises, plans &amp;Co of proposed reservoirs have to be deposited with the appropriate Government Departneiat, which then has an opportunity of commenting on the design from the safety and other points of &quot;iew,    It nay be that this practice could usefully be extended but we would net recommend its being put on a statutory basis, for we think it most important that the responsibility for safe design, construction and maintenance should in the ordinary course rest clearly on the undertakers and their technical advisers *    The safety questions here involved will often be of a kind on which there will be wide differences of opinion among acknowledged experts;    and the decision as to whether or not any particular structural or other works are to be carried out must often depend on a balance between the margin of safety to be allowed, and financial and. other considerations,.    If a Government Department assumes any responsibility for such decision: it is bound to work on a wide margin of safety, and may therefore feel constrained to impose requirements which are more hampering to industry than the needs of the case really demands14.    Accepting the principles that responsibility should clearly remain on the owners and their advisers and that compulsory insurance and Government intervention on the lines above indicated are Loth inadvisable, there remain nevertheless,  certain proposals which we think would not be inconsistent with them,  but would materially assist in promoting safe practice and. protecting the rights of the public.   We think they need only be applied,  at any rate at first,, to large reservoirs (say reservoirs designed to hold more tnan a million gallons above the adjoining natural ground level) though there may be some smaller reservoirs failure of whioh might possibly cause serious damage,.    &quot; Large&apos;&quot;  reservoirs might be required to be designed by and constructed under the supervision of a Chartered Civil Engineer qualified to, deal with this class of work who should, on tho completion of the works,  supply plans showing the works as actually constructed,  give a certificate that the work has been efficiently executed in exact accordance with these plans and deposit the plans and Certificate with the reservoir owner.    The reservoir should not be brought into use until such deposit has. been made-    After construction &apos; large&quot; reservoirs (existing or future) should be thoroughly inspected and reported on at intervals by an independent and similarly qualified. Chartered Civil Engineer, who should, state what measures or works,  if any, are, in his opinion, necessary in the interests of safety.    These inspections and reports might be required to be made at least once every ten years, but the Engineer should, where in any case he considers another inspection neoessary after a shorter interval, include a statement to that effect in his report, and the next -inspection should then be required
i 3 5 (J-6-correspondingly sooner.    The period might run from the date on whioh the reservoir was brought into use or from the last report as the case may be. Suitable provision should be made for spreading the work during the initial period after the new requirements&apos; oome into force.    By an &quot;independent&quot;   Engineer we contemplate one of consultant standing who has had no responsibility for the construction or the design of the works to be inspected.(Sorts to be 15.    When such an independent Report or a Certificate on constructiondessible to hlic. is obtained, the reservoir owner night be required to advertise the factin appropriate newspapers-;    and he should also be bound,  on application made at any time, to state whether and when such a Report was made orCertificate was given (and, if so requested, to produce them for inspection) to the Local Authority of any district likely to bo affected and to any person resident or holding property in any such district.He should also furnish certified copies on payment of the cost ofcopying.Ight of 16.    Provision should be made to enable any such Local Authority or[plication .  .UlOourts. party to apply to the Courts if he alleges  (a) that no certificate onconstruction has been given or that no independent report has been made as required by the Statute or (b) that the measures stated in any such report to be necessary in the interests of safety have not been carried out within a reasonable period;    and the Court should be empowered,  after hearing the case,  to make such order (including, possibly, an order as to acquisition of land &amp;c.) as they may deem necessary in the interests of safety including,  if they think proper,  an order that the water be lowered in the reservoir until such report has been obtained and such measures or works as may be recommended therein or ordered by the Court, have been carried out.    The Court might also have power to impose a penalty for failure to obtain a certificate or report when the Act required it.Efhat Court 17.    We have considered briefly whether such application should befc,ess shouldU&apos;en- made to the High Court or -to some lower Court.    We think that as regardsmany of the questions which might be raised Justices in Petty Sessions would not be a suitable body to adjudicate.    They have, as pointed out above,  certain powers in some cases undor the Waterworks Clauses Act, 1863, but these do not appear to have been invoked and we think they might be repealed if the present proposals are adopted.    The choice seems to lie between the High Court and (at any rate for some classes of case) Quarter Sessions;    and perhaps the position would be met by providing that applications under the Statute should be to the High Court,  but that the Lord Chancellor should have power by Rule to confer jurisdiction on a lower Court in any particular class of case and subject to such conditions as he may think fit.    Such Rules need not be made until some experience had been gained of the working of the Statute, if at all.
18.   We think that these proposals should go a long way towards enabling the public to protect their rights, while obviating many of the difficulties of intervention by Government Departments;    and they should not be regarded as unduly burdensome on reservoir owners, who may reasonably be expected in their own interests to obtain good expert advice on the design and construction of their works,  and to have them periodically inspected by firms of consulting engineers.19.    This Report has been brought to the notice of the Scottish Office to consider how far our conclusions are applicable to Scotland.JOHN ANDERSON (Chairman).HOME OFFICE.December, 1926.
