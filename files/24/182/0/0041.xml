Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1926.SECRET.CP. 416 (26).CABINET.PROPOSED CREATION OF A KINGDOM OF IRELAND.Memorandum by the Secretary: of State for Dominion Affairs.I HAVE had two very interesting conversations with Mr. Kevin 0&apos;Higgins in the course of the last few weeks. In the first one, when he was bidding me farewell after the conclusion of the Conference, he told me that he thought the Conference had greatly helped on things towards the further reconciliation between the Free State and Northern Ireland. He had had a long talk with Lord Carson, to whom he had unfolded the proposition that Northern Ireland,-preserving its existing system of Government intact, should in other respects transfer itself from Great Britain to a United Kingdom of Ireland. Lord Carson had not been at. all unsympathetic but had doubted whether it was not a little too early to broach the question. He had, however, definitely encouraged Mr. 0&apos;Higgins to discuss the matter with Sir James Craig. I said that while I thought that Sir James Craig would probably think it premature even to ventilate publicly such a far-reaching change, and that I felt sure that he would be wise in being guided by Sir James&apos;s judgment on that point, I personally sympathised entirely with the general idea. I added that there were certain sentimental obstacles to the Union of Ireland which it was within the power of the Free State to remove, e.g., the Sinn Fein Flag, the abolition of the King&apos;s head on stamps and coinage, the extravagances of the Irish language cult, &amp;c. Mr. 0&apos;Higgins thought they could meet Ulster on most of these points. He was not himself a fanatic about Gaelic; he thought they would readily restore the King&apos;s head once Ireland was a Kingdom again, and though he felt that the Union Jack was still regarded by most cf his people as a party emblem, he saw no difficulty in dropping the Sinn Fein flag and having a new flag with, say, a harp and crown on a blue ground. He also suggested that, as part of the bargain, they would be only too willing to accept as Viceroy Lord Londonderry or anyone else who commended himself to the North.Lunching with me on the 10th December Mr. 0&apos;Higgins returned to the subject and told me that Sir James Craig was expected in Dublin shortly, and that he and his colleagues had been discussing what I gather had previously been a personal idea of his, and wished definitely to sound.Sir James Craig upon it. Mr. Cosgrave had, however, felt that they ought not to sound him, even informally, on a matter which after all involved the transfer of a part of the present United Kingdom, without the Prime Minister&apos;s consent to such a conversation, and I subsequently took him to see the Prime Minister/to whom he expounded his proposal in general terms. Meanwhile in the course of our conversation Mr. 0&apos;Higgins referred to the altered relationship between Great Britain and Ireland which would ensue from his proposal. I asked him in what way he meant the relationship would be altered except in so far as Northern Ireland would be transferred and the title Free State merged in the more dignified and more appropriate title of Kingdom. He then made clear, what I had certainly not understood from his first conversation, that what he has in view is not merely that a United Ireland should be described as the Kingdom of Ireland, but that there should be a separate kingship, in other words a Dual Monarchy such as that which existed between Austria and Hungary before the war. I pointed out to him that this was opening up a much wider question, and meant in fact going back upon the whole principle upon which the constitutional relations of the Empire had been defined at the Conference. Our whole basis there had been the freedom of action of the several Governments held together by the unity of the Crown, in virtue of which all British subjects throughout the Empire[15518]
shared a common nationality and a mutual loyalty. The break up of this common nationality and of the unity of a single Crown as the emblem of this and of much besides, would not only have many serious practical disadvantages, but would affect the whole conception of Imperial unity. What he suggested could not of course be considered apart from its bearing upon other Dominions which would be entitled to claim what had been conceded in the case of Ireland. I gathered from him that he had considered the practical difficulties to this extent, that he had contemplated the creation of the Irish kingship being accompanied by a special permanent treaty of offensive and defensive alliance as well as by provisions for reciprocal citizen rights. He felt that whatever might be the theoretical advantages of admitting the unity of the Crown, sentiment in Ireland would not be quite met as long as they were British, and not Irish subjects, and that they would much more readily come forward to take part actively in a British war if they regarded themselves as bound to do so by treaty than if they were automatically involved in it in virtue of their position as subjects of the same Crown. I suggested that as regards the former point we had already met them in dealing with passports by agreeing to the use of the designation &quot; subject of His Majesty the King of Great Britain, Ireland, &amp;c,&quot; and that it did not very much matter what general colloquial designation was used to describe that status if they could find one that they would prefer to use for themselves instead of &quot; British subjects.&quot; On the treaty point, I suggested that after all the automatic obligation which he objected to was one which they had also assumed by treaty when they agreed to accept the position of a British Dominion, and that it involved no positive obligations to co-operate actively with us in any war. I added, however, that I saw no objection, and indeed much advantage, in the suggestion that the peculiar geographical proximity of Ireland and Great Britain justified a special internal treaty between ourselves for matters of defence, and possibly customs, wdiich would thus subsume and in practice supersede the much more limited underlying obligation of membership of the Empire, and that anything of this sort would of course make.it easier for Northern Ireland to come in. Generally speaking, I expressed sympathy with all the proposals he had in view, even possibly to the extent of a separate coronation in Dublin, as long as the fundamental unity of the Crown and the practical and sentimental consequences flowing from it throughout the Empire were not prejudiced.The whole question is, of course, entirely in the air and may not come up for a practical decision for a long time to come. When it does the Ulster point of view in this matter will naturally have to be considered, and it is not at all likely that Ulster would be prepared to accept anything which impaired in any way the unity of the Empire or the world-wide status of British subjects which its citizens at present enjoy. Meanwhile, it is very interesting to know the direction in which Irish opinion is working, and the extent to which the Free State leaders are prepared to go for the sake of Irish unity and stability. It was clear to me from what Mr. 0&apos;Higgins said that he is afraid of what may happen in Ireland when the present Government finally exhausts its popularity, and I think he hopes&quot; a union of Ireland may make any return to power of the extremist faction impossible. Another interesting feature is the obvious influence which the study of Austro-Hungarian precedents has had upon them. Mr. Arthur Griffiths whole Sinn Fein policy was adopted, and indeed the words &quot; Sinn Fein,&quot; translated from the Magyar policy, between 1848 and 1867, of refusing to have any dealings with the common Austro-Hungarian Parliament, and apparently the culmination of this in a recognised &quot; Dual Monarchy,&quot; is still regarded as an ideal solution by them. They have obviously not yet sufficiently realised the bearing of this upon the wider framework of an Empire based on a different constitutional conception.My colleagues may possibly care to read again in this connexion a memorandum (E (B) 22) on the conception of the Crown as a factor in Imperial unity, which was circulated to all members of the Cabinet before the Imperial Conference.L. S. AMERY.December 13, 1926.
