In the main they relate to persons who had claims lo benefit current and were not at work on the dates given.(2.) The figures above for the four weeks in October are exclusive of persons in the Coal-mining Industry who ceased work on account of the dispute which commenced on the 1st May.(3.) The latest figures available, viz., for the weeks ended the 8th and loth November, 1926, are given in Part (I)) of this Report.The percentage of unemployment (Great Britain) in the insured industries at the undermentioned dates was October 27, 1924    .... .... .... ....   10-8.   :- 26, 1925    .... .... .... ....   11&quot;025,1926    .... .... .... ....   13&quot;4 (men only 15-2)It will be seen from Table (A) above that during the four weeks ended the 25th October the number of persons on the registers decreased to the extent of 11,580. &apos; The decrease was rather less than the successive decreases which have occurred during the last three months. Compared with a year ago, the figure is approximately 300,000 greater, whilst it is 534,000 more than at the 26th April, that is, just before the Coal Dispute began. Unemployment amongst men increased during the month, but was more than counterbalanced by a larger decrease among women. During the first week of the month there was an increase in unemployment, but a sharp decline took place during the second week and was followed by further reductions in each of the last two weeks.

Short time working amongst women decreased to the largest extent, being approximately 63 per cent, of the total reduction in temporary stoppages. &quot;Che figure of wholly unemployed increased by over 19,000 during the month, and the figure for men accounted for over 90 per cent, of the total increase in this category.(C.) Unemployment in Insured Industries.The latest date for which unemployment figures by industries are available is the 25th October, 1926, at which date the percentage unemployed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland was 13&apos;6, as compared with 13&apos;7 at the 20th September, 1926, with 11*4 at the 26th October, 1925, and with 10&apos;9 at the 27th October, 1924. The figures at the 25th October in respect of industries showing appreciable variations in unemployment during the month, together with the increase or decrease as compared with the previous month, with the 26th April, 1926, and with a year ago are given in the table below : Industry.

The number of insured workers working short time was reduced by 48,357, whilst the figures of those wholly unemployed increased by 35,921. The better supplies of fuel which were available helped towards this improvement. From the Table given above it will be seen that improvement was most marked in the Cotton
Industry, which showed a decrease of 25,719, mainly the result of better employ-ment in the industry due to the reduction in the price of the raw material and to better supplies of coal.   Pottery and Earthenware also showed a reduction of 7,093.On the other hand, Shipbuilding and Ship Repairing suffered a further decline, but the outlook in this industry is a little more promising provided an early settlement in the Coal Dispute takes place. A number of contracts for new tonnage have been placed but cannot be started until the position in the coalfields has improved. In Building and Public Works&apos; Contracting, the shortage, and increased cost, of materials affected the position, and work on many schemes was retarded.Other staple industries not mentioned in the above table which showed a variation in unemployment were: Pig Iron Manufacture (decrease 1,173), Iron and Steel Trades (increase 1,373), Manufacture of Tin Plates (increase 1543), Motor and Aircraft Engineering (decrease 1,212), Jute (decrease 1,833) and Glass Bottle Making (decrease 974).(D.) Latest Figures.The latest figures of unemployment published are those for the 8th November, giving the total number on the registers as 1,562,959. This is an increase over the position on the 25th October amounting to 46,788, and an increase over a year ago of 364,833. The preliminary figure for the 15th November is 1,551,500, showing a decrease in one week of 11,459.ARTHUR STEEL-MAITLAND.Ministry of Labour,November IS, 1926.
