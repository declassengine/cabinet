The Memorandum circulated by the Secretary of State for War (CP. 381(26)   )  points out  (1)  that apart from the fact that a single tank is of no military value,  it is not clear why the Free State Government want one at all:   (2) that once the Free State military authorities get the tank into their possession, the technical details may become known to foreign officials; and (3) that if the details reach the United States, they will enable United States armament firms to compete more successfully with us in the market for such vehicles.I annex, for the information of my colleagues, a copy of a letter on this subject which I addressed to the Secretary of State for War on November 8th.As regards  (1) above,  I do not think it need be supposed that the Free State military aut?norities desire to obtain the tank   for any other purpose than that of training a certain number of officers and. men in the handling of the latest design of tank,  so that if and when it becomes financially possible for them to establish a tank unit they may have the necessary personnel available.

regards  (2)  I understand that.the War Office would he willing to supply a tank of this design to any other Dominion;    and I an not convinced that there is a substantially greater risk of leakage in the case of the Irish Free Sta.te than there would be in the case of e .g. Canada,.      I ami satisfied that if we were to impress upon the Irish Free State Government the importance of secrecy in such 3, matter,  secrecy would be observed by the responsible military authorities; the danger would lie in leakage through a subordinate, and this danger is,   I should imagine,   equally great wherever the opportunity for it may occur.      As regards  (3)  it would appear to me that if the War Office propose to permit Messrs., Vickers to go  into the market for tanks of this kind,  we are debarred from giving the only reason  (namely,  the military,  as opposed to the commercial,  necessity for secrecy) which would justify us in refusing the request of the Irish Free State Government,As stated in my letter to the Secretary of State for War,  I am of opinion that it would pay us best in the long run to comply with this request at once, impressing upon the Free State authorities the necessity for secrecy,      If, however,  it is decided to refuse the request,   it will be necessary to accompany the refusal with, some explanation.      The only explanation which,  in my opinion,   it would be possible to give would be that the refusal is based largely on the absence of anything like a definite understanding as to the relations between the Free State forces and ours3
This would,  however,  imply that if,   as a result of the Conference which is shortly to he held in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the Articles of Agreement,  or otherwise satisfactory relations are . established with the Free State forces,  the matter will be open to further consideration and I think that in the event of a refusa.1 this should be made clear to the Irish Free State Government.L.S.A.15 November,  1926. Dominions Office.
8th November,  1926.My dear Worthington Evans,I have thought carefully over the matter of the Mark II Tank which the Irish Free State want for training purposes.    It is unfortunate that the Irish Free State should have discovered, after being told by the War Office that we could not supply a machine,   that they can get one direct from Vickers and it is very awkward,   especially in view of the fact that 0!Higgins and Desmond Fitzgerald were present when you pressed the Dominion Prime Ministers  to attend the rank display.; that there is now no means of further postponement which does not involve drawing a distinction between the Irish Free State Forces and other Dominion Forces.      My own feeling is that it would pay us best to deal with the matter In a broad spirit and to face any risk of leakage that may he involved.      Some risk is inevitable in the case of any Dominion and I should doubt, whether the additional risk in supplying a machine to the Irish Free State as compared with the risk in supplying one,  let us say,   to Canada,  outbalances the politcal advantage of a demonstration on the eve of the Defence Conference of our readiness to co-operate.      It would be open to you,  of course,  to impress upon the Irish Free State authorities the necessity for talcing steps to., secure that all proper precautions are taken to preserve the secrecy of the designs.But if I am to intervene,  I do not think that I could do more than represent privately to Cosgrave that this type of tank is a very secret contrivance and that we would prefer to allow the request to stand over until after the coming Defence Conference when it should be possible to arrive at a general understanding with regard to the exchange of secret military information and inventions.      I should be glad if you will let me know what you think.Yours ever.
