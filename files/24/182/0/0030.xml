a. (26) - a.a  F F E In D I X. THE TITLE OF P/IELI/I&apos;1ENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Home&quot;Affairs^The impending change in the Kingrs Title makes it necessary to consider again the question of making a change in the Title of Parliament.      The existing Title was given by the Union of Ireland Act, 1800, which enacted, that Parliament is to be styled &quot;The Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain arid Ireland&quot;.The question whether any change in the Kingfs Title would be necessitated by the establishment of the Irish Free State was first considered by the Irish Provisional Government Committee of the Cabinet in 1922, At the same time the question of the Title of Parliament  t* and of the continued use of such expressions as &quot;Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; was raised.     In November, 1922, the present Attorney General advised that the Union of the Crowns was not affected, but that it woulf. be advisable to change the Titles of Parliament and tjf the Consolidated Fund, and that if northern Ireland opted out of the Irish Free State, the expression &quot;Great Britain and Northern Ireland&quot; would seem to be suitable.      It was decided not to make an;/ alteration in the Royal Title for the time being,  the view being taken that no alteration could be made -without full consultation with the Dominions and India.     No action was taken as regards Parliament and the Consolidated Fund.
Early in 1923 when the adaptations of existing enactments necessary to give effect to the Government of Ireland Act and the Irish Free State Constitution Act were being considered,  the question of the Title of Parliament and the continued use of other expressions which had become out of date  (including the term &quot;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&quot;) was again raised.      It was decided as a result of the meeting of the Home Affairs Committee of the 5th February, 1923,  to alter the Title of the Consolidated Fund to  &quot;Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom&quot;, and to omit In the preamble of the Army Annual Act the words &quot;of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; wherever they occurred (leaving the words &quot;United Kingdom&quot;), but no change was made in the Title of Parliament, no further progress having been made at that time as regards the Royal Title. On the 27th March,  1923, an Order in Council under Section 6 of the Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act, 1922, was made dealing- with the meaning of the term &quot;United Kingdom&quot; in enactments passed before the establishment of the Free State.      This laid down that in suoh enactment the term should generally be interpreted as excluding the Free State, but no provision was made as regards the meaning of the term in subsequent enactments.How that the Title of the King is to be changed it seems impossible to perpetuate the Title of Parliament, which has now become unreal, and the difficulties which.have arisen with the Government of Northern Ireland in connection with the proposed Royal Title could be completely-met by such a change.      It is suggested that the Title &quot;Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&quot; would be appropriate.      Thii.s use of the term &quot;United Kingdom&quot; would gratify the sentiment of Northern Ireland, and it
would be in harmony with the meaning given to the term in enactments passed before the establishment of the Free State by the Order in Council above referred to, and also with Its continued use in subsequent enactments.      The change of name will have to be effected by Act of Parliament,  for though legally the change might be made by an Order in Council,  the. matter is clearly of too great Importance to be dealt with by any authority other than that of Parliament.It is suggested that the change &quot;of the Title of Parliament should be made in the Act which will authorise the Issue of a Proclamation altering the Title of the Xing. The Act might provide that notwithstanding anything contained, therein,  the Parliament shall be deemed to be for all purposes the same Parliament;    incidentally this will enable the consecutive numbering to be continued.      The opportunity might at the same time be taken to provide that in all future enactments references to the term &quot;United Kingdom&quot; shall,  except when the context indicates the contrary, be Interpreted as meaning Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Attention has been called in Parliament to the appearance of the term &quot;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; on Treasury Notes.      The alteration of the term there and in any other official instructions,  etc., where it say still appear should be considered.W.J.H.pome office.30 th November,  1926,-3-
