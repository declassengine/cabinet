Circulated to the Cabinet ^^^^E^^^^Q^ot the Secretary of State  or Foreign Affairs33 3MEMORANDUM0^/ on the- 2d[hall GA^Ina Indemnity (Amendment) Bill.The total British indemnity imposed upon China after the Boxer rebellion of 1900 was  16,500,000 (principal and inter-est).     Payments were to be spread over forty years.     When China entered the war in 1917, payments of the indemnity were suspended and postponed for a period of five years.     At the end of that period, i.e. in 1922, it was felt that this country could hardly continue to exact an indemnity from an ally of the Great War.     Further, the German and Austrian shares of the In-demnity had lapsed.     The United States had already (in 1908) remitted for educational work a part of its original share;    it was proceeding to do the same with the balance.      Japan was con-contemplating a similar step, so was Soviet Russia.     Accordingly, in December 1922, the Chinese Government were notified that His Majesty1 s Government would app3.y their funds in future to ob-jects of mutual benefit to Great Britain and China.      The bal-ance of the fund, still due, was about  11,000,000 (principal and interest).This decision necessitated an Act of Parliament, since the funds had been applied to national debt redemption by the Fin-ance Act of 1906.      Owing to the political situation here, the passing of this legislation was seriously delayed - a delay which impaired the spontaneity of the British gesture.     The Act passed at last in June 1925.      But in the same month the anti-British agitation broke out . in China, and. it became gradually clear that the provisions of the Act would not now meet the changed situation.The 19*^5 Act provided that t4a** general control and admin-is tration of the funds should be in the hands of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, advised by a statutory committeeof.. 0
of 11 persons.      In the autumn of 1925 the nucleus cf this committee strongly advised that a delegation of three members, including k0rd Willingdon as Chairman, should be sent to China to confer with the three Chinese members and make invesflga-tions on the spot.This delegation cabled from China that in order to meet Chinese opinion on the subject the control and administrationof the funds should be vested in a joint (Chinese and British) Board of Trustees in China, in the same way as had been done in the case of the American funds.      This proposal was accepted in principle by the Secretary of State, who undertook to endeavour-vour to obtain Parliamentary approval to the necessary amend-ment of the Act.     The new Bill, therefore, provides for the appointment of a Board of Trustees by the Government of the Republic of China, after consultation with and in agreement with His Majesty&apos;&quot;a Government.     The numbers of members of the Board is purposely left open, as it may be found desirable to have more than the 11 which are suggested by the delegation. The Bill also indicates in very general terms that the Board, in applying the fund, shall have regard to the general schemes and principles recommended and adopted by the statutory com-mittee.The report of the statutory committee, together with the report of Lord Willingdon&apos;s delegation, are being presented to Parliament as a White Paper.Foreign Office,171h november, 1926.
