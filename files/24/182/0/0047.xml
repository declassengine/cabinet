In the main they relate to persons who had claims to benefit current and were not at work on the dates given.(2.) The figures above for the live weeks in November are exclusive of persons in the Coal-mining&apos; Industry who ceased work on account of the dispute which commenced on the 1st May.(3.) The latest figure available, viz., for the week ended the 13th December, 1926, is given in Part (D) of this Report.The percentage of unemployment (Great Britain) in the insured industries at the undermentioned dates was November 24, 1924   .... .... .... 1Q&quot;723, 1925    .... .... -. 10-722,1926   .... .... .... ...   13&quot;4 (men only 15&apos;3)It will be seen from the table given above that notwithstanding a fairly rapid rise in unemployment towards the beginning of the month, there was a total decrease during the five weeks ended the 29th November of 20,104.   The figure on [15560]
that date (1,496,067) is the lowest that has been reached since the General Strike. The number of persons unemployed is, however, still 50 per cent, greater than on the 26th April of this year and 330,792 more than at the corresponding date last year.(B.)

Unemployment in Insured Industries.The latest date for which unemployment figures by industries are available is the 22nd November, 1926, at which date the percentage unemployed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland was 13&apos;5, as compared with 13&apos;6 at *the .25th October, 1926, with 11*0 at the 23rd November, 1925, and with 10&apos;8 at the 24th November, 1924. The figures at the 22nd November in respect of industries showing appreciable variations in unemployment during the month, together with the increase or decrease as compared with the previous month, with the 26th April, 1926, and with a year ago are given in the table below : Industry.

Prom reports which have been received, it would appear that in most mining areas there has been an active resumption of work, but that operations were somewhat handicapped, particularly in regard to the revival of the export trade in coal, owing
(D.) Latest Figures.The latest figure of unemployment published is that for the 13th December, giving the total number on the Registers as 1,410,378. This is a decrease over the position on the 29th November amounting to 85,689, and an increase over a year ago of 282,932.ARTHUR STEEL-MAITLAND.Ministry of Labour,December 23, 1926.to a shortage of railway waggons. In the Iron and Steel industries it is satis-factory to note that there was again a further improvement during the month. So far very few blast furnaces have been re-kindled, but a considerable number of steel furnaces have been re-started, mostly in the Midlands. In the North-Eastern area and in Lanarkshire the recovery from the disorganisation caused by the strike has been slower, but the outlook towards the end of the month was much more pi-omising. Although not appearing on the above table, the Shipbuilding industry showed a slight decrease in unemployment during the month (1,591), and, from the amount of orders which are reported to have accumulated, considerable activity is likely to take place in most areas as soon as normal supplies of fuel and steel become available. The anticipated recovery in the Cotton industry did not make itself manifest during the month, largely owing, it is said, to instability in the prices of the raw material. Such improvement as did take place was due to the resumption of full-time workiug in certain areas in the American spinning section contrary to the recommendations of the Short Time Organisation Com-mittee. In the Woollen and Worsted and in the Boot and Shoe trades the improvement which took place can largely be attributed to seasonal causes. Increased activity, also pai*tly of a seasonal nature, was maintained in the Motor industry.The principal increases in unemployment during the month were in the Building, General Engineering and in the other industries mentioned in the above table. A geographical analysis shows that these increases were confined largely to the South-Eastern and South-Western Divisions, the numbers on the Registers of these two Divisions showing a total increase of approximately 23,400 during the month. With regard to the increase in unemployment which is shown in the latter Division (15,500), it is necessary to explain that 75 per cent, of this has been caused by a slackening in one particular area, namely, Swindon, where over 10,000 employees at the Great Western Railway Works were put on short-time working. It is reported that about 50 per cent, of these are expected to resume full-time working in the near future. In Building, the normal seasonal slackness has been accentuated this year by a falling-off in constructional work, largely owing to a shortage of steel supplies. It would appear that this cause has also been responsible for the falling-off in employment in General Engineering.
