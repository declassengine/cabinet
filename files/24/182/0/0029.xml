UlIS DQClg IS THE property  OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOWjRNMENT^ tk e o ret, % -- .-- copy no.:wsbCLj1^4il4j.26JU- CABINET,CO-PARTNERSHIP    IN industry memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,Though the Coal Strike Is over,  the circumstances In which it has come to a conclusion will not do much to restore peace to industry in general.     There is no security that in a few months&apos; time we may not be faced by another industrial crisis in some other branch. Even if this is avoided it seems&apos; doubtful whether any improvement.ovem.ent,.. in &quot;confidence between employers and workmen can be expected, and unless that happens there must be a vast waste of energy and consequently a great increase in the cost of production from what it might otherwise be.      This,  and the intolerable loss and inconvenience of the last few months, Is leading to a very considerable recrudescence m the Press of proposals for a better organisation of industry.      I have seen such proposals In the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, the &quot;Westminster Gazette&quot;,  the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and the &quot;Daily News&quot;.      The proposals differ,, but they all include two elements:-    some precautions to prevent future strikes such as more or less compulsory: arbitration, and some method of improved co-operation between employers and employed.     Meanwhile, the Labour Party are naturally utilising industrial difficulties as an argument in favour of socialism.      In these circumstances I suggest very respectfully that the Cabinet ought to have a definite-lr,
policy in the matter.     It may he that after consideration they will decide that nothing can be done, and that we must leave industry to work out its own salvation without any guidance from the Executive0     Personally I believe that that policy will turn out to be impracticable, but if it is our policy the sooner we say so the better. To say nothing is merely to encourage people to try and force our hands in one direction or another.     As my colleagues know, I have long believed that the only salvation for our industry is to be sought in giving to the workmen a conviction that their interests, moral and material,  are bound up with the undertaking or the industry in which they are engaged.      To accomplish that,  it seems to me that the workmen should be given a share in the profits,  some voice In the direction of the industry, and, where practicable,  a participation in its Capital.      That is the system known as Co-partnership which has. In some cases at least, been tried with remarkable success. That is also the remedy to which we pledged ourselves in the pamphlet &quot;Looking ahead&quot;.      I do not think that it would be possible to impose by legislation a system of co-partnership on industries or undertakings where the employers or the employed were unwilling to accept it, but I think progress might be made in three directions:-In the first place the system might be definitely and clearly advocated in Ministerial speeches, particularly in the speeches,of those Ministers who are chiefly concerned with industry.      Their pronouncements would, of course, ga.in immensely in value if the Prime Minister felt able to press the same cause with his unrivalled authority.Secondly, the Board of Trade and/or the Ministry of Labour might perhaps he able to offer administrative assistance to any employers who desired to establish co-partnership system.      It is evident that there is no cast-iron model to which all co-partnership systems should conform-2-
a plan which would work very well with Gas Companies might require extensive modifications if it were to be applied to coal mining, end still more to agriculture.,      Expert examination of this and similar questions could he,  I suggest, very suitably performed by;the highly skilled officials of the    Board, of Trade or Ministry of Labour.Thirdly,  as evidence of our good faith in the matter, there are some small legislative changes which night be proposed with a view to smoothing the path of co-partnership schemes, particularly in relation to the lav; of limited companies.      These are not of any great importance in themselves, but they would serve both as an advertisement of the system, and as an opportunity for pressing its desirability in Parliament.Finally I venture to repeat the suggestion I ma.de on the &quot;7th May, that a small Committee of the Cabinet should be appointed to consider in detail what steps in this or other similar directions could usefully be taken.R.C .November 26th, 1926,
