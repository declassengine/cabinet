This document is the property of His Britannic Majeaty&apos;8 Government.Printed for the Cabinet, December, 1926.SECRET.Copy No.CP. 414 (26).ADEN.    CONTROL AND ADMINISTRATION.JOINT MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARIES OF STATE FOR THECOLONIES, WAR AND INDIA.1. The question of the future control of Aden is one which has been under consideration both before and since the autumn of 1922 (when the Duke of Devonshire circulated a Memorandum (CP. 4347) on the question to the Cabinet) without any decision beinff arrived at.2. Before the war the General Officer Commanding and Political Resident, Aden, was directly under the control of the Government of Bombay in regard to political and civil administration and under the Commander-in-Chief in India on the military side. The political work was comparatively small and concerned only the Protectorate tribes, and the sole military responsibility outside the fortress of Aden was Perim Island, for which the garrison furnished a small detachment.3. Following the recommendations of the Welby Commission of 1900 the Imperial Government has contributed  .72,000 a year towards the cost of the military charges of Aden, plus half the capital outlay (works and armaments) on its defence, and no change in the basic contribution has since been made, although before the war it had ceased to equal half the military expenditure the proportion contemplated by the Welby Commission on which the Agreement of 1900 was based. In addition the Imperial Government has borne one half of the military charges due to the Aden operations and their aftermath.4. During, and subsequent to, the war the Yemen ancl Asir came into the political sphere of the Aden Protectorate ; Kamaran was added to the civil administration and its safety became an additional militar&apos;y responsibility. Shaikh Said, which commands Perim, and was formerly held by the Turks, became during the war part of the Imam&apos;s territories. These changes led to the Colonial Office taking the place ot the Bombay Govemmeut on the political side, and the War Office taking a share in military affairs and to the existing haphazard and wholly indefensible arrangement.5. Under this arrangement the charge of the political, civil and military administration of Aden is held by a Major-General of the Indian Army who is styled General Officer Commanding and Political Resident, Aden. This officer is responsible to no less than four higher authorities, to each of whom he has separately and directly to account as follows :- (a) The Secretary of State for the Colonies for political administration.(b) The Governor of Bombay in Council for civil administration.(c) The Commahder-in-Chief in India for a portion of the military administration.(d) The War Office for defence and the balance of the military administration.In addition, there is an Air Force Flight which is administered by the Air Ministry.The above description of the existing organization will be sufficient, without reference to the difficult political and administrative questions with which the Resident is continually being faced, to show why everyone is agreed that some change in the present arrangement is necessary.(B26/17)   100   12/26   W.O.P.   2911
6. The question of the strategic importance of Aden to India and to the Empire as a whole was considered by the Defence Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence in July, 1923, when the following conclusions were agreed to : (1) That as Aden is an essential fuelling station on the Imperial lines of communi-cations to the Far East, it is of greater general strategic importance to the Empire than to India. It has also a strategic importance with regard to the Suez Canal, Somaliland, and Arabia, and is the site of an important wireless telegraph station.(2) That so far as strategical considerations as set out in (1) above are concerned, it would be advisable for the administrative responsibility for Aden to rest with the Imperial Government.Various discussions subsequently took place on the future control of Aden ; but, for various reasons, particularly financial, it was not found possible to arrive at an agreement.7. The following are the alternative proposals that have been discussed, viz. : (a) Complete transfer to the Imperial Government with a contribution from India.(b) The control and cost of the civil administration of Aden itself to remain with india, and the political and military administration to be transferred to the Imperial Government, India contributing one-third of the military and political expenditure subject to a maximum of  150,000 a year.(c) Complete retransfer to India with a contribution from the Imperial Governmentof, say,  200,000 or  250,000 a year.8. Course (a), i.e., transfer to the Imperial Government, is the one which was recom-mended by the Middle East Committee as long ago as October, 1922, and subsequently in July, 1923, by the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence. The adoption of this alternative has also from time to time been strongly advocated in the Colonial Office as being the one best suited to meet the changed conditions and our increased political responsibilities in South-West Arabia.9. This arrangement would, however, be the most expensive one from an Imperial point of view, since the total cost of the military garrison of Aden is somewhere in the neighbourhood of  500,000 per annum besides about  30,000 for the Air Flight ; and if so complete a transfer of all control were forced on the Indian Government, it would appear from the discussions that have taken place that the Indian Government would be unwilling to settle even on the basis of a contribution of only  150,000 per annum, which would leave  350,000 per annum to be met from Imperial funds. When Lord Reading, the then Viceroy of India, was in London last summer he expressed the view that any suggestion to transfer Aden completely to the Imperial Government would be so unacceptable to Indian opinion that he could not carry it through his Legislature.10. Course (c), complete retransfer to India, has been recommended by the Treasury on the assumption that this would avoid any of the increased expenditure involved in the complete or partial transfer to the Imperial Government. The view of the Government of India, however, is that, even in the event of a retransfer, India is entitled to press, not only for the strict application of the principle of half-and-half-division underlying the Welby Agreement, of 1900, but for a revision in her favour of the proportion of cost to be borne by her, in view of the fact that Imperial interests in Aden have now come far to outweigh Indian interests. There is therefore likely to be little, if any, financial advantage in this proposal over the alternative which we put forward below. On the other hand every argument of general policy and of strategy, in our view, is decisive against the control of a fortress whose chief importance to-day is in connection with Arabian politics on the one hand and general maritime defence on the other being in the hands of a Government preoccupied with purely Indian considerations.11. We now come to the alternative which, after full consideration, commends itself to us as the best solution both from the Imperial and from the financial point, of view. It is that a single chief authority should be appointed in control at Aden by the imperial Government, with the concurrence of the Government of India, in the shape of a Political Resident, or Governor, preferably a civilian. The Governor, who would have with him a military officer to command and administer the troops, should be responsible to the Imperial Government in all political and military matters, and to the Government of India only for the internal municipal administration of the Settlement of Aden, which would continue on the same basis as if the Settlement had remained part of British India. The Governor should have the titular rank of Commander-in-Chief as is customary
elsewhere, it being understood that the possession of this title will not confer on him any right to give executive orders to the troops. The Officer Commanding the Troops should be appointed by the War Office after consultation with the Colonial Office. He should communicate direct with the War Office on questions of intelligence, training and preparation for war, as well as on matters affecting the routine administration of the troops.We recommend that this arrangement should take effect from 1st April, 1927, as regards finance, and as regards administration as soon after that date as practicable.12. This arrangement would secure Imperial control in all essential matters, but leave India the satisfaction of retaining Aden as part of India and still controlling the civil affairs of the settlement, including its resident Indian population. In view of this we consider that India should be prepared to contribute towards the military and political charges a sum of  250,000 a year for 3 years, and after that  150,000 a year, or one-third of the total cost (including the cost of any Air Force units at Aden), whichever is the lesser figure. A separate arrangement in regard to arrears up to 1st April, 1926, is under discussion between the War Office and the India Office. No arrears wdll be payable for the year 1926-27. Service of British troops at Aden will reckon as Indian for the purpose of non-effective charges up to 31st March, 1927. The civil and municipal receipts and expenditure should accrue to and be defrayed by the Indian Government.13. As regards the capital value of transferred military assets, we think that as the garrison is to be transferred as a &quot; going concern,&quot; India should hand over the land, buildings, and fixtures free. It has also been suggested that the Royal Indian Marine steamer &quot; Cornwallis &quot; and military stores and equipment of all kinds taken over by the Imperial Government should likewise be transferred free. The India Office demur to this suggestion.14. As regards the existing Imperial liability, referred to in paragraph 3 above, for one-half of any capital outlay on works and armaments for the defence of Aden, we consider that in future any such capital expenditure should not be separately treated, i.e., it would be included in the expenditure on the garrison each year, of which (after the first three years at  250,000 a year) India would pay one-third subject to a maximum of  150,000.15. The War Office attach as a condition to these increases in Imperial charges that from the date (1st April, 1927) on which they come into force, the payment to India of the subsidy of  130,000 for sea transport out of Army Funds, which, like the present financial arrangement as regards Aden, had its origin in the recommendations of the Welby Commission, should be discontinued.   The India Office demur to this condition.16. We consider that the responsibility for the political and military administration of Aden should be vested primarily in the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and that Imperial expenditure in connection with Aden should be borne on the Middle Eastern Vote. The military expenditure will in the first instance be defrayed by the War Office, subject to reimbursement from the Middle Eastern Vote.17. We believe that the above scheme will meet the essential needs of Imperial policy and strategy without arousing any conflict with Indian sentiment, and at substantially no greater cost than would be involved in a complete transfer to India. We strongly commend it to the Cabinet as the best solution of a state of affairs which is by common -consent anomalous and indefensible.L.S.A.L.W.-E.B.
