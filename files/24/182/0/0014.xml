iffrraj)OCUMSWT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S QOVERWMEMT.CABINET. ^SECRET Copy No.   d OC.P.ftp.389(25). \POOR   LAW   REFORM.Memorandum by, the Minister of Health.1.  sat Deoaaagy the Cabinet sanctioned the Issue of provisional proposals for the Reform of the Poor Law, and theseproposals have now been before the Country for nearly a year,during which they have excited considerable Interest andcomment.     They have, moreover, been the subject of discussion,both by correspondence and by interview, with the Associationsrepresenting the various classes of Authorities and have as aresxflt undergone some modification and elaboration.     I nowdesire to obtain the sanction of the Cabinet to the drafting ofa Bill to be passed into law during the next session ofParliament.2. The effect of the Bill will be to bring about the moat important reorganisation of local government which has been attempted at least since 1902, when the Education Act was passed, and possibly since County Councils were established by the Local Government A.ct of 1888.A reorganisation which involved the disappearance of Boards of Guardians and the carrying out of their work In County and County Borough instead of Union areas was recommended both by the Majority and by&apos; the Minority of the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws which reported in 1909j    and by the Maclean Committee who In 1917 largely succeeded In reconciling thendivergencies of view which had separated the members of the Royal Commission on questions other than the question whether Boards of Guardians should be abolished.     In 1918 and 1919,during the passage of the legislation by which the Ministry ofIIIHealth was established, the Government of the day gave anHexplicit undertaking, which has never been repudiated by their
successors that the reform of the Poor Law should be carriedout as soon as possible.     The principle of a reform involving the transfer of the work of Guardians to other Local Authoritieshas, at least since this time, been endorsed by all political parties and Parliaments, and was specifically approved withouta division on a motion in the House of Commons in May 1925.3. The principal evils which the Poor Law Reform bill will be designed to deal with aro -(1)   The waste and damage to public health resulting from the treatment of sick  persons, especially in institutions, by two seta of Authorities working separately, namely by Guardians, if these persons are destitute, and by the ordinary Local Authorities if they ore not;(2)   The unfair Incidence of rates raised to meet the oost of Poor Law relief, wv-ich are levied over areas settled nearly a century ago and In no way corresponding to the areas of existing Local Authorit ies j(3)   The practice, at present confined to certain areas but showing a marked tendenoy to spread, of electing members of Boards of Guardians who are pledged to grant-outdoor relief In excessive amounts, or to people who ought not to get it, or both;(4)4 The lack of interest in the elections of Guardians shown, in most areas as a result of the large number of separate elections of these bodies;(5)   The absence of correlation between payments ofoutdoor relief and payments of unemployment benefit?(6) The unsatisfactory performance of health duties by backward Authorities in districts included in areas administered by County Councils;(7)   The absence of proper Exchequer control over grants in aid of health services paid on a percentage basis which results necessarily in an excessive amount of scrutiny by my Department of every proposal by Local Authorities to do anything which, if approved, will involve payment of grant;(8)   The continuance of the complicated and obsolete system&apos;of assigned revenue grants.4. It Is accordingly proposed to provide in the Bill,first, for the concentration in the hands of the more important- 2 -
Local Authorities of the work now done by Boards of Guardians and the consequential abolition of the Boards, together with some statutory limitation of out relief;    secondly, for strengthening the hands of County Councils in their endeavours to secure that Local Authorities in County areas discharge their public health duties;    thirdly, for reforming the financial relations between the Exchequer and Local Authorities by substituting, In accordance with the declared policy of the Government, block grants for the existing percentage grants in aid of health services, and by abolishing, in accordance with the recommendations of successive bodies of Inquiry, the system of assigned revenue grants.Outline of, the Proposed Bill .r5. The Bill need contain only a small number of important clauses, and the subject-matter of these clauses under each of the three heads mentioned above can be briefly stated as follows.(1) Transfer of poor Law Work toJLpcal Authorities.6. Except on the points mentioned below In paragraphs 12 and 14, It is not proposed to alter the duties or powers at present entrusted to Boards of Guardians.7. Provision would be made for the abolition of Boards of Guardians and the transfer of their work and property (including institutions) to Local Authorities.The Local Authorities outside London would be(a) in the 83 County Boroughs, having a total population of about 12! millions in 1921, the Town Councils;    and(b) elsewhere, that is in the 61 Administrative Counties with a total population of nearly 21 millions in 1921, the County Councils.
0.   Provision would be made for the submission to the Minister of Health by County and County Borough Councils of schemes or proposals for carrying out the work transferred to them from Guardians.9.    These schemes or proposals of Looal authorities would cover such matters as -la)   Proper use of existing Poor Law institutions and other premises now vested in Guardians;(b) Transfer of existing officers of Guardians to the service of the new Authorities;(c) Administrative arrangements, with special reference to sub-division of County areas for particular purposes;(d) In County areas, performance by Town or District Councils, with their consent, of any work transferred from Guardians to County Councils which is similar to work already being done by the Town or District Councils (e.g% education of ohildran or maternity and child welfare work);(e) Delegation of powers (except rating or borrowing) to existing or new committees of the local Authorities.(f) Appointment of sub-committees of existing or new committees of the looal Authorities and assignment of functions of committees to such sub-oommittees.(g) Addition   of suitable persons, suoh as members of other Local Authorities in County areas, and sitting members of Boards of Guardians, who are not members of the new Authorities, to committees and sub-committees of the Authorities, up to a maximum of half the membership of the committee or sub-committee.10. Provision would be mace to enable the membership of a Local Authority under the Bill to be increased in order to enable them to deal better with work transferred to them from Guardians.11.   Provision would be made for combination between Looal Authorities for any purpose of the Bill.
12.    It woxxlfi bs necessary to modify the existing law of settlement, in conformity with the principle of the. &quot;El LI, by substituting the County Borough or Administrative County for the parish or Union as the area of settlement of persons who become a charge on public funds.13.   provision would be made on lines already accepted by Parliament in comparable cases for dealing equitably with existing offioers of Guardians on their transfer to the service of Looal Authorities&apos;, and for their proper compensation if they are not transferred.14.    In order to remove prevailing abuses of public assistance, it is proposed to alter the existing law by providing that except in cases of sudden and urgent necessity or special need otitdoor relief shall not be given to persons who are receiving, or entitled to, benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Acts;    and that outdoor relief to persons of 18 or over not in receipt of unemployment benefit shall not be more than the amount of that benefit, or, for unmarried persons, more than two-thirds of that amount.Medical or surgical assistance would not be affected by these restrictions.(  ) Relations between County Councilsjand^o thor Authorities&quot;&quot;in Administrating Cocnties.15.    The work on which our public health system is foundedis what is commonly called preventive, that is, provision cfpure and ample water supplies, proper sewerage and methocH ofsewage disposal, efficient scavenging, and so on;    this work is now in the hands, not of County Councils.,  but of SanitaryAuthorities (Town Councils and Councils of Urh--n und rural districts).
16.    It was recognised by Parliament even in 1888 that County Councils should not remain indifferent to the standard of performance of sanitary duties attained by the local Authorities of areas within the Administrative County, and the Local Government Act of that year accordingly gave County Councils power to make representations on this subject to the central authority (now the Minister of Health).    It did not, however, specify the action to be taken in consequence of such a representation, and perhaps for that reason the measure has hitherto remained inoperative,The health work now performed by the Guardians but transferred to County Councils by this Bill,  taken in conjunction with the many new developments of curative work which Parliament has given them to administer since 1888, will greatly increase the Interest of County Councils in seeing that preventive duties are properly performed by Authorities within the County;    for the more efficient that preventive work is, the le3S curative work has to be done by the County Council and paid for by the inhabitants of areas within the County as County ratepayers,17,    It is accordingly proposed to provide in the Bill for the strengthening of the existing law relating to the power of County Councils to make representations or take other action in cases in which Authorities within the County fail to carry out duties imposed upon them by Parliament for the good of the health of their inhabitants.(3)    Revision of Grants to local Authorities.-18.    It Is proposed that the financial part of the Bill should provide for the payment to the appropriate Local Authorities of fixed grants, to be settled by Parliament in the first instance for a period of three years, and there-after for periods of five years, in lieu of -
(a) Existing percentage grants in aid. of health services:   andlb) Existing assigned revenue grants, including the grants under the Agricultural Pates 4c ts.19.    The main objects in view are(a) To enable the Chancellor of the Exchequer to settle for a reasonable period In advance the total grant which (subjectto the establishment of new services)will become payable in aid of the health and other services covered by the new system.(b) To simplify the relations between the Minister of Health and Local authorities by enabling grant to be paid on a broad consid ;ration of the needs of each Authority and their efficiency in doing their work, without the detailed central control involved in the present system of grants varying with expenditure;(c) To redistribute the assistance given at the cost of the taxpayer so as to lighten the burdens of the so-called &quot;necessitous areas.&quot;EG.    The basis of the distribution of the proposed new grants is still under discussion between the Local Authorities concerned and myself.     I have not discussed the total amount of grants which will be made available, but for the purpose of illustrating the formula of distribution which I have suggested, the total has been taken at  12,000,000 the aggregate for 1924/25 of the grants which will be abolished.     I have proposed that the minimum sum which should be made available should be the average of the aggregate of the abolished grants for the throe years preceding the appointed day.But it will, in my opinion, be essential to make a further limited sum available in order to secure tho acceptance by Local Authorities of the changes proposed by the Bill.     Under the scheme of distribution based on population modified by rateable value which I have suggested
(as indeed under any scheme of distribution of a block grant devised to avoid the defects of a percentage grant and, therefore, unrelated to expenditure) those Local Authorities who have been obliged to incur expenditure on their services much above the average, or have adopted an exceptionally liberal scale of expenditure in order to attain a relatively high standard of service, would receive much leas than under the existing $rant system; and I am satisfied that it would be impossible to secure any measure of agreement with Local Authorities if the existing distribution of grants were wholly ignored.21.     I propose, therefore, that for the first period of three years for which the grant will be fixed the grant, pr.yf.l-3s to any Local Authority as calculated under the general formula cf distribution should be made up to the average of r.he abolished grants actually received by the Authority during the three years preceding the appointed day.It is not possible to state precisely the sum whioh would be required for the purpose, but I am advised that the addition to the average of the aggregate of the abolished grants for the three years preceding the appointed day could be kept w:; thin  1,000,000 if the total sum to be distributed under ire general formula were to be somewhat reduced, or within a maximum of  1,500,000 if in the course of discussion with the Local Authorities the reduction proved to be impracticable.I may here point out that if the percentage grant system were continued the normal expansion of the health grants would necessitate a payment of grant during the three years in question considerably in excess of. the average grant for the three p--p.ee d-ing years; so that apart from any fluctuations which might occur in the Agricultural Rates Act grants and the Assigned Revenues, if no charge were made in the present system, the additional  1,000,00c or  1,500,000 suggested is to a large extent an anticipation
only of new money which, would in any case have to he provided.^      Reception of the Proposals.22,     It may &quot;be of assistance to my colleagues that I should attempt to state shortly the measure of support which the proposals have obtained, the nature and extent of the opposition to them, and the principal difficulties which I should expect the Bill to encounter during its passage through Parliament.23.     If agreement can be reached with the Local Authorities on the question of the revision of their financial relations with the Exchequer, I think I can count upon support for the proposal to transfer the work of Guardians to Local Authorities from(a) The County Councils Association;(b) The Association of Municipal Corporationsso far as it represent3 the Town Councils in County Boroughs, who will be Local Authorities under the Bill as it stands; and(c) The Urban District Councils!Association.24.      I must count upon opposition to the proposal to transfer the work of Guardians to Local Authorities from(a) The Association of Poor Law Unions as representing Boards of Guardians;(b) The Rural District Councils&apos;Association,which in this aspect represents the Guardians over again.25.      There may probably also be some attempt on the part of the Association of Kunicipa.1 Corporations and the Urban District Councils Association to amend the proposals so as to make the larger Mon-County 3orouble and Urban Districts the bodies to which the work of the Guardians shall be transferred in their area instead of the County Councils.
26,      I have, further, received a good many represent at iona to the effect that while it may be very desirable to transfer the work of Guardians to Town Councils in the large industrial towns, it is not desirable to transfer the work of Guardians in country districts to County Councils, first, because the Guardians in such districts do their work satisfactorily, and secondly, because County Councils will not be able to do it any better, if as well.27.      In order to meet the dritiaisms of the proposals made on these lines I circulated informally in September to all supporters of the Government in the House of Commons some notes on the effect of the Governments proposals in country  . districts which laid special emphasis upon the methods by which County Councils with wide areas would be expected to draw upon the intimate local knowledge of ex-Guardians and others in dealing with applications for outdoor relief.28,      1 doubt whether these notes have entirely removed the anxieties expressed on the points mentioned above but no critic has yet been able to suggest a satisfactory alternative to the principle that County Councils should be. the Local Authorities outside the large towns, and I anticipate that debate will only strengthen the case for my proposals; undoubtedly there are difficulties in administering outdoor relief in country districts through County Councils, but I am satisfied that they can best be dealt with by administration after the Bill has become law, and not by fundamental changes in the Bill itself.
101 /J29.      There is one other line of criticism which may he made from our own side and that relates to the absence of any provision for the disqualification of paupers from exercising the municipal franchise.     In view of the occurrences in West Ham and the recent Socialist successes in municipal elections it may be  argued that to transfer the administration of out-relief to local authorities without introducing the security of disqualification is very greatly to increase the risk of wholesale corruption in municipal affairB.     There is a good desA to be said for this point of view and personally I am of the opinion that the receipt of relief should disqualify for the municipal though not for the Parliamentary franchise, which is of course exorcised at much rarer intervals.     It has, however, been represented to me by a number of members that this would create a serious grievance while leaving in the hands of the aggrieved a weapon which would assuredly be used to avenge their wrongs, and accordingly I have not inserted any provision for disqualification.     It may be however, that it would be well to ascertain the views of the party further through the &quot;Whips, before taking a final decision upon this important point.30.      Assuming then that the financial provisions of the Bill are substantially settled by consent before its introduction, I anticipate that the main Parliamentary difficvilties will arise on the questions(a) Whether any, and if so \vhich, Coitficilsof Non-County Boroughs and Urban Districts should be Local Authorities for the purposes of the Bill;(b) Whether some other bodies should be entrusted with the administration of cut-relief in the country districts, instead of thec o u. nt y c c un c i 1 a ;(c) Whether the receipt of relief shoulddisqualify for municipal franchise.
I do not consider that these difficulties are at all likely to eJiaSattwea:   the passage of the Bill.Conclusion.31.     My case for introducing the Poor Law Reform Bill at the earliest possible moment in the Session of 1927, and pressing it forward as one of the principal measures of that Session, is that(a) There is now a general expectation throughoutthe country that the proposals will be proceeded with forthwith and any hesitation would be regarded a3 a retreat with consequent loss of prestige;(b) If we do not settle this question, there is every reason to suppose that it will be taken \ip by the first Socialist Government that comes into office on lines that may well prove disastrous;(c) The proposals have obtained a largermeasure of support from Local Authorities than was expected;(d) No practicable alternative scheme hasbeen put forward;(e) Subject to a- satisfactory settlement ofthe financial proposals of the Bill, no opposition is to be anticipated which cannot be met in the course of debate.32.     My oolleagues will note that this memorandum doesnot cover the question of application of the proposalsfor Poor Law reform to London.Negotiations with the London County Council andother Authorities in London concerned for the adoptionof a scheme embodying the principles which will applyto the rest of the country are in active progress; andI anticipate that I shall be able to secure the agreementof the Local Authorities in London on the principles ofsuch a scheme, and a large measure of agreement on itsdet ails.N.C.18th November, 1928.
