Bbitish Policy in China. I. Tariff Conference and Canton Taxes.1. The facts with regard to the questions of the Tariff Conference and the Canton taxes, on which a decision has now to be taken, are set out in two previous memoranda (CP. 308 (26)).**A C -P. ZUrc CW).2. We are now faced with the alternative of continuing to co-operate with the Powers in a common policy at the Tariff Conference, which has been sitting in Peking since October 1925, but which is now in a state of suspension, or of breaking away from them and taking isolated action in China. Co-operation has been our practice ever since the Washington Conference of 1921, and it should be clearly understood that the alternative proposal does not necessarily imply the complete scrapping of the Washington policy of co-operation, but it does mean a break on a particular and very important issue, namely, whether the Washington surtaxes are to be granted unconditionally or not. This is admittedly a very serious -step to take and one that can only be justified on the very strongest, grounds.3. The aim of the Washington treaties was to maintain the principle of the open door, to assist China in her efforts to establish her position as a sovereign independent State and in general to unite the Powers in a common policy of justice and generosity towards China. The Powers have failed to observe these treaties either in the spirit or the letter..  3700 [15412] b3o
4. At Washington China was. promised certain tariff increases. The conference that was to grant them was to meet within three months, but for purely selfish ends France delayed ratification for over four years. By the time the conference met the whole atmosphere in China had radically changed. The Nationalist movement had made great headway and it was no longer possible to keep China in leading strings, even for her own benefit. Nevertheless, the Powers were determined to extend foreign control over the whole of China&apos;s customs revenues, even when vastly increased by tariff autonomy, and they refused to grant the very moderate tariff increases, known as the &quot;Washington surtaxes, except upon conditions which ensured that the proceeds of the surtaxes would be placed under foreign control and applied towards the liquidation of their own debts.5. This has been the traditional attitude of the foreigner towards China, but, inevitable though it may have been up to even quite recently, it seemed to us that in adopting such an attitude now, the representatives of the Powers were blind to the true nature of the forces now at work moulding a new China forces which are conveniently summed up in the word &quot; nationalism.&quot; In this view we were supported by a large body of responsible opinion representing British commercial interests in China, and by expressions of opinion from sources so far apart as the &quot; Economist,&quot; the &quot; North China Daily New^s &quot; and the Vatican. In a remarkable conversation with a member of the British Legation to the Holy See, Mgr. Constantini, Delegate Apostolic in China, expressed a conviction, formed after a long study of political conditions, that a new China was being&quot; born. He indicated that the recent action of the Holy See in consecrating a number, of Chinese Bishops, was due to a recognition of the fact that any body which was indifferent to the national feelings of the Chinese was fated to lose any influence it might possess. He thought that the powers of resistance of the Chinese were extraordinary, that the national genius could be relied on to withstand both Russia on the one hand and Japan on the other, and that if there were frank recognition of the fact that China is no longer a &quot; colonial country &quot; the perils of xenophobia would be immensely reduced.6. We feared from the beginning that if the Tariff Conference failed to grant the Washington surtaxes Canton would seize them. She has now done so. We have therefore to decide whether we can continue to co-operate in the policy which the Powers wish to pursue. Their attitude in regard to foreign control and debt consolidation has been referred to above. It is diametrically opposed to our own views and if we join them in the attempt to impose this policy upon China the full brunt of China&apos;s resentment will fall upon us. With regard to the Canton taxes the policy of the Powers is to protest against this and every other breach of treaty rights, but they have no intention of backing&quot; their protests in any way. Considering that the Chinese can make out so strong a case, and that the treaties are admittedly out of date, it seems to us that such a policy, so far from preventing further violations of treaty will only exasperate the Chinese and perhaps cause a debacle in which it may not be possible to save anything from the wreck.7. We have reluctantly joined in a formal protest against the Canton taxes. Can we afford to continue this policy of joining in protests which the other Powers have no intention of enforcing&apos;? A recent telegram from His Majesty&apos;s Acting Consul-General at Canton enables us to see what such a policy translated into practice would mean.The Nationalist Government of Canton, he tells us, in their efforts to modernise their State are issuing a series of enactments dealing&quot; with such matters as the stamp taxes, quarantine, wireless, &amp;c, which the consuls are asked to enforce on foreigners. They are all reasonable in form and are probably copied from similar legislation in other countries, but they involve breaches of extra-territorial and other treaty rights against which the consuls are obliged to protest and adopt an apparently unreasonable and obstructive action. In connection with the new taxes the Canton Government established a corps of inspectors &quot;for the protection of the revenue and for the prevention of illegal and enemy activity.&quot; In the face of the protests of the consular body and customs administration, the Government have temporarily stopped the functioning of the inspection corps, but British interests predominate so vastly over those of other countries that in the eyes of the Chinese it is to British opposition alone that this check is to be attributed. Attempts are consequently being made to freeze out the British river steamers. Anti-British societies are trying to keep alive the boycott by intimidation of shop-
keepers, cargo coolie guilds, &amp;c. The success of such attempts depends on the degree of toleration shown by the Government and that in turn is affected by our attitude towards the Governments measures.8. Sir R. Macleay has told us and his view is confirmed by all experienced observers that the nationalist movement for the abolition of the treaties is not confined to the Cantonese. It has come to a head more rapidly in Canton than elsewhere, but the problem in Canton is in essentials the same problem as confronts us in the whole of China. Mere barren opposition does not seem to be the right attitude to adopt towards such a movement as this. It. might be checked for a time by force, but this is obviously out of the question. At a recent interview between the China committee of business-men and the Secretary of State the spokesmen for Lou don and Lancashire on that committee did not support the use of force on behalf of British interests. None of the Powers are prepared to use force. Then what does the policy of the Powers amount to ? Merely registering protests pro forma or emphatic and then standing aside and watching the treaty position crumble away without any constructive idea how to save anything from the wreck. There is so little to recommend such a policy that it would seem as if the Powers who favour it had not thought out the problem of China and were deluded by words and formulas.Yet, if we concur, this is the policy that will be adopted in China with the certainty that the Chinese will hold us to blame for all the friction and ill-feeling that will result and will vent all their exasperation on us. It might mean the ruin of British interests in China, and we have therefore been driven to seek for an alternative policy.9. The policy which we think should be adopted towards China may be outlined as follows : -(a.) We should abandon all ideas of forcing control upon China even for her own benefit. We need not relinquish the control we now exercise over her customs revenues, but the proceeds of any tariff increases should be at her own free disposal- to squander even on civil wars if she is foolish enough to do so.(b.) We should press for the immediate unconditional liquidation of the promises made at Washington.(c.) We should abandon the policy of ineffective protests over minor matters, but try to make our protest effective where vital interests are at stake.(cl.) We should no longer insist on the strict letter^ of treaties which are admittedly out of date. Each case of invasion of the privileged position hitherto held by the foreigner in China should be considered on its merits, and we should persuade the Chinese that in each case we are prepared to consider any reasonable proposals they may make, even if contrary to strict treaty rights, in return for fair and considerate treat-ment of foreign interests by them.(e.) Applying these principles to the immediate problem of Canton if the Powers agree to grant the Washington surtaxes immediately and unconditionally we should endeavour to regularise the Canton taxes on the basis of entrusting their collection to the Maritime Customs. If the Powers still refuse to grant the Washington surtaxes, British merchants should give every facility as regards the levy of the Canton taxes, and we should endeavour to arrange for the friendly assistance and co-operation of the Customs Administration in their collection.10. The policy outlined above now has the general support of His Majesty&apos;s Minister in Peking. Sir Ronald Macleay, in his most recent telegram dated the 16th November, says : &quot; I agree that under present conditions policy of unconditional grant of Washington surtaxes to provinces and various regional authorities is the right one, and that in making such a suggestion His Majesty&apos;s Government alone among the Governments of the principal Powers concerned seem to be really facing the facts of the situation, which are of course totally different from those which faced the framers of the Washington Treaties.&quot;11.   The Washington Treaties bind us to full and frank consultation with the other Powers.   If, therefore, after mature deliberation, we have come to the conclusion that the policy hitherto pursued by the Powers in China is wrong, and [15412] r 2
that a new policy should be adopted, it would appeal&quot; to be our plain duty to explain frankly our objections to the old policy and ouro^jasons for recommending the new one. A memorandum for this purpose tras^l^^ajl-boan. prepared ^wid-is-/aune-xedr.12. If this memorandum is handed to the Powers it will quickly become public property. Therefore, whether we state in the memorandum that we propose to break away from the Powers and follow our new policy alone, or whether the memorandum contains no hint of any such intention, the result in practice will be very much the same. The mere fact of the publication of the memorandum will be taken as an indication that we have already broken away from the Powers, and it would, in practice, be impossible for us to continue to pursue a policy in China when, in a document of such importance, wTe had publicly condemned it and proclaimed our faith in a diametrically opposite policy.13. The decision we have to take therefore resolves itself to this : shall we attempt to persuade the Powers to adopt what we consider to be the only wise policy in China, or shall we stifle our convictions and continue to concur in their policy, which we believe to be wrong and morally indefensible ? For, having once stated our own policy, we shall be publicly committed to pursue it, and by the fact of stating it we shall have already broken away from the Powers.14. The objections to breaking away from the Powers should not be minimised, but the only alternative is to pursue reluctantly a policy which we believe to be wrong. The mistrust and suspicion to which this has already given rise has been alluded to above. We offend both the Chinese and the Powers, and it seems hardly possible to continue on so unsatisfactory a course any longer. On the other hand, if we adopt a policy of our own the rift in the solidai-ity of the Powers may only be for a time. There is at least a chance that the Powers may appreciate the force of our arguments and decide to follow our lead. The only two Powers that really count in China are America and Japan. American policy has recently been guided by Wall Street, but if our appeal for justice and generosiy gains the ear of the Middle West the State Department may have no option but to follow. The Japanese have already abandoned all idea of coercing China, and they may be quick to see that the real alternative to coercion is not ineffective protests, but a sympathetic adjustment of treaty privileges to the claims put forward by the Chinese authorities at different times and in different localities.15. On the whole, therefore, we are inclined to think that the chief danger to be feared from a public statement of our new policy is not that it will break up the solidarity of the Powers but that it may encourage the Chinese in a general assault upon all the treaties. This is a very real danger, and great care has been taken to guard against it in the memorandum which is being prepared for communication to the Powers.II. The Canton Boycott.Canton is the headquarters of the Kuo Mhi-tang, the Chinese Nationalist party, which was founded by Sun Yat-sen. The city has a long tradition of restlessness, turbulence and anti-foreign feeling. The Canton Government regards itself as independent of Peking and in fact as the rightful Government of all China, though it has not yet so far claimed formal recognition by the Powers either as an independent Government or as the Government of China. It declines to regard itself as bound by the so-called &quot; unequal treaties &quot; concluded by the Powers with China, and ignores them in many respects, though it has made no direct attack on some of their main provisions.From July 1925 to October 1926 the Cantonese boycotted British trade. No goods of whatever origin coining via Hong Kong Avere allowed to enter the Province of Kwangtung, of which Canton is the capital, and no goods exported from the province were allowed to go via Hong Kong. No British vessel was allowed to discharge cargo and no vessel, of whatever nationality, that had called at Hong Kong was allowed to unload. In addition, the life of British residents was made most unpleasant by the intimidation of their servants and by the difficulties in maintaining their food supply. Such trade as was conducted by foreigners other than British was heavily mulcted for the necessary permits.The boycott arose out of the shooting incidents at Shanghai on the 30th May, 1925, and at Shameen (the Anglo-French concession at Canton) on the 23rd June of the same year, the latter of which was deliberately provoked by Communist
influence.   Chinese fired on the Anglo-French concession; the British and French troops replied, and some fifty Chinese were killed. The three forces behind the boycott were : 1. The Canton Government, who, though they denied responsibility, neverthe-less connived at and encouraged the boycott and took no steps to terminate it. In time they became tired of the boycott, which incommoded the local Chinese merchants only less than Hong Kong, and they began to find the Strike Committee an embarrassment, a kind of imperium in imperio; yet they did not feel themselves strong enough to proceed against the boycott organisation.2. The boycott organisation manned by an army of unemployed from Hong Kong and Canton, and at one time numbering more than 100,000; this organisation maintained its own courts and prisons, and its members made a living out of permits, fines and confiscated goods.3. The Soviet advisers of the Canton Government, who, though they cannot be said to have created the boycott, yet certainly to some extent guided it, and directed the Nationalist anti-foreign movement into anti-British channels. Neither the Cantonese Government nor the Kuomintang, whose organ it is, is Communist, though there is a left wing which is in sympathy with the Communist doctrine. They have turned to the Russians because the Russians alone were prepared to treat them on equal terms and to provide money, advisers and equipment. The Chinese Nationalists are using the Russians for their own ends, and it may be expected that if the Kuomintang establishes itself as the Government of China and enters into relations with the Powers its need of Russian support will decrease and the influence of the Russians will wane. The Soviet Government, however, has some right to claim the Canton boycott as its most outstanding success outside its own borders since it came into existence. The loss to British trade and to the colony of Hong Kong, in particular, has been very great.Several attempts were made to settle the boycott question by negotiation, but they broke down on every occasion, chieflj&apos; owing to the refusal of the Hong Kong Government to pay compensation or to countenance the payment of compensation, i.e., blackmail, to the strikers, which the Cantonese negotiators made the sine qua non for a settlement. In March 1926, the Cantonese authorities, who had hitherto refused to regard themselves for the purposes of negotiation as anything more than intermediaries between the strikers and the Hong Kong Government, proposed direct negotiations, but these came to nothing for the reason given above. Negotiations were reopened at Canton on the 15th July on the proposal of Eugene Chen, the newly appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Canton Administration. Mr. J. F. Brenan, His Majesty&apos;s acting consul-general at Canton, was a member of the British delegation. Negotiations were suspended on the 25th July, the two delegations desiring to refer to their respective Governments the proposals made to each of them by the other. The Cantonese proposal was for an enquiry into the facts of the Shameen incident of the 23rd June, 1925. The British proposal was for a loan for port and railway construction at and around Canton. These proposals, however, came to nothing, and by the beginning of September the situation had been changed by two further, developments.In the first place the increased activities of the strike pickets in Canton harbour and their shooting upon British subjects moved His Majesty&apos;s Government to take forcible action to put a stop to these piratical activities. On the 4th September the picket boats were driven off the harbotir; the pickets were driven off British-owned wharves and a gunboat was moored along the strike examination shed. This rendered the enforcement of the boycott of British shipping much more difficult than it had previously been.About the same time the Cantonese northern expedition obtained unexpected success and advanced into Central China, occupying Hankow, where there are foreign concessions, and Hanyang, where there are iron works and an arsenal. They had thus established themselves in the Yang-tsze Valley, and had almost eliminated Wu Pei-fu as a military force. It was feared that the extension of Cantonese influence to the Yang-tsze would be followed by a boycott of British goods on the familiar Cantonese lines, but although there was some anti-British and anti-foreign agitation, no serious boycott developed.   There was some firing
on foreign vessels on the river, but on the whole the Cantonese forces showed themselves well disciplined and well behaved. The Cantonese forces are now engaged with those of Sun Chuan-fang, who holds the region surrounding Shanghai.The next development was the announcement by the Cantonese Government, in a note to His Majesty&apos;s acting consul-general of the 18th September, that they proposed to terminate the Hong Kong boycott on or before the 10th October. They also stated that the proper Chinese authorities would levy a special consumption tax of 2  per cent, on ordinary imports and 5 per cent, on imported luxuries, together with a special production tax of per cent, on exports. The customs authorities would be asked to assist in the collection of these taxes. It was explained verbally to His Majesty&apos;s acting consul-general that the proceeds of these taxes would be used to liquidate the boycott organisation and that the taxes would be levied on the goods of all nationals. The promised declaration of the termination of the boycott and blockade was issued on the 10th October, not by the Canton Government itself, but by the Strike Committee and the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang.The decision of the Cantonese Government to terminate the boycott w7as probably due-1. To the effect of the action of the British naval forces in Canton harbour onthe 4th September and apprehension of further more drastic action ; 2. To need of money for their northern campaign ;3. To desire to secure their rear by a settlement with His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment.The greatest credit is due to Mr. J. F. Brenan, His Majesty&apos;s acting consul-general at Canton, for the resourceful handling of the situation. He established personal relations with the Cantonese Government and played on their fears at the critical moment, and they in their turn were only too glad to play on the fears of the strikers, who allowed themselves to be bought off at an easy rate.As a result of the calling off of the boycott passenger traffic between Hong Kong and Canton has reached almost normal proportions. Goods traffic was also resumed in small measure and slowdy improved. It has lately, however, suffered a set-back as the result of the recrudescence of the anti-British campaign by the boycott organisation^ and owing to their threats of intimidation; the shipping companies are also having trouble with the labour unions.The position as regards the boycott is, however, on the whole fairly favourable, and it is hoped that the Cantonese authorities will do their utmost to remove existing obstructions to the development of British trade. Mr. Brenan has been authorised to intimate to the Contonese authorities that we are prepared to give sympathetic consideration to any reasonable proposals the Cantonese authorities may make in exchange for fair and considerate treatment of British interests by those authorities, and that we desire that the Cantonese authorities should realise that if they adopt an unreasonable attitude they will only create; friction and impede the achievement of their own projects.III. The Question of the Recognition of the Southern Government.The extension of the control of the Southern Government over a considerable part of China has brought the question of their recognition to the forefront. It has recently been stated in reply to a question in the House that His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise and deal with the Chinese authorities at Canton as a local administration and that any further step would have to be most carefully considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government, having regard to their treaty obligations, the facts of the case, and the desires of the Chinese themselves.By article 1 of the Nine-Power Treaty, signed at &quot;Washington on the 6th February, 1922, the contracting Powers, other than China, agree &quot; to respect the sovereignty, the independence and the territorial and administrative integrity of China.&quot;The question therefore arises whether this undertaking means that we have bound ourselves to uphold the unity of China; whether, for example, if Canton definitely broke away and started a republic of South China, we are debarred by the treaty from recognising the new State.
The following is the answer to these questions given by the second Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office : &quot;Article 1 (1) of the General China Treaty is really in the nature of a self-denying ordinance, and its object was to exclude operations like the Japanese occupation of Shantung. If Canton were to set up as an independent State by agreement with China, there is, in my opinion, nothing in the article in question which would prevent the signatories from recog-recognising the new State; and further, if, without the consent of the Central Government, Canton broke away and succeeded in establishing itself as an independent State in circumstances which, apart from the treaty, would entitle it to recognition by other States, I think the position would be the same. On the other hand, I think the article does debar the signatories from encouraging separatist movements in Chinese provinces, or from anything in the nature of premature i-ecognition of a rebellious Government as an independent State ; otherwise it would be open to any signatory to get round the effect of the article by assisting the rebellious province to establish its independence.&quot; Further, all that the article obliges the signatories to do is to respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial and administrative integrity of China, and if these things do not exist it is not possible to respect them; therefore, if China broke up into a lot of mutually independent fragments, the signatories could not be precluded from recognising the situation thus created.&quot;The principal members of the Cantonese Government have recently proceeded northward to Wuchang to organise the administration of the conquered territories, and the Foreign Office have suggested to Sir R. Macleay that he should send a secretary there * to establish personal contact with them and to discuss with them infoivmally the question of their future relations with His Majesty&apos;s Government. At the same time, His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Hankow (which is across the Yang-tsze from Wuchang) has been informed that as soon as a Kuomintang Government is in a position which entitles it to claim to be the Government of China and to assume full responsibility for the treaty and other obligations of its predecessor, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be prepared to recognise such a Government as the Government of China.His Majesty&apos;s Government would not, however, be justified in withdrawing recognition from Peking in favour of Canton unless they were satisfied that either (1.) Canton had effectively established its authority over the whole of China and had, in fact, become the Government of that country ; or(2.) That it was exercising authority over a portion of territory which had established its independence of the rest of China and was entitled to recognition as an independent State.The facts at present do not justify (1) though they may perhaps justify (2), but Canton has so far not made any claim to be recognised as the Government merely of part of China and it is not for His Majesty&apos;s Government to volunteer any such recognition.It is understood that both the Japanese and the United States Governments are carefully examining the question of the status of the Cantonese Government with a view to deciding what relations they ought to establish with it. The United States Minister at Peking has recently made a tour of the country, visiting Canton, while the Japanese are sending an official of their Ministry for Foreign Affairs on a similar tour, and it is reported that an emissary from the Nationalist Government will shortly proceed to Japan in this connection.IV. The Wanhsien Incident.The Upper Yang-tsze from Ichang to Chungking was opened to steam navigation by the Treaty of Shimonoseki, 1895. It was not, however, until 1909 that the first merchant steamer established itself on this run, and British shipping did not become a serious factor in the situation until 1919.   The advent* Sir R. Macleay has now advised against the adoption of this suggestion.
sof steamers on this section of the river met with much opposition from the vested interests (junk owners). The steamers have also been considerably harassed by the various military commanders who, in the civil war that is chronic in Szechuan, established themselves along the river. The latest phases of military interference are set out in chronological order below: February 1926. Informal agreement made locally whereby Yang Sen was allowed to search British, American and Japanese steamers for arms.May 1926. Search extended to opium.June 17, 1926. His Majesty&apos;s consul at Chungking reported : &quot; The number of instances during the past three months of deliberate firing by Chinese troops on British and other foreign merchant shipping up and down the river and of commandeering of these vessels for unpaid transport of Chinese soldiery has easily eclipsed all previous records.&quot;July 2, 1926. Butterfield and Swire, Shanghai, reported commandeering rife both above and below Chungking.July 1926^. Chungking consular body rescinded informal search arrangement.August 9, 1926. Hankow consul-general reported: &quot; Yang Sen&apos;s forces are firing on all steamers which pass Wanhsien without stopping.&quot;JulylAugust 1926.-Military authorities brought pressure to bear on the &quot; Szechuan &quot;Waterways Steamship Navigation Society,&quot; of which the two leading British shipping companies (Jardine, Matheson and Co. and Butterfield and Swire) are not members, to agree to the carriage of Chinese troops in all merchant-vessels at half-passage rates, and attempted to compel British shipping companies to fall in with this arrangement (F. 4465, paragraph 6).August 11. -British and American consuls protest to General Liu Hsiang that merchant steamers cannot carry Chinese troops (ibid.).August 14. Liu Hsiang replies that as Szechuan is free from hostilities there is no objection to carriage of troops (ibid.).August 20. British and American consuls repeat and emphasise their protest (ibid., g 7).August 21. Steamship &quot; Wantung&quot; commandeered at Foochow to carry 1,000 troops (Yang Sen&apos;s) to Wanhsien.August 23. Steamship &quot;Wanhsien&quot; similarly commandeered at Foochow. August 24. Steamship &quot; Fushan &quot; similarly commandeered at Foochow.August 26. Rear-Admiral, Yang-tsze, authorised armed guards being put on British ships.August 27 (night), General Kuo Ou-tung placed 100 armed soldiers on steamship- &quot; Wanhsien &apos;&apos; at Wanhsien.August 28. General Kuo&apos;s troops remain in occupation of steamship &quot; Wanhsien&quot; with orders to repel by force any attempt at eviction by His Majesty&apos;s ship &quot; Cockchafer.&quot; *August 29 (morning). Commander of His Majesty&apos;s ship &quot;Cockchafer&quot; interviewed General Kuo&apos;s chief of staff. &quot; After a lot of difficulty I managed to talk him over, and he agreed to see his general and advise him to remove these troops, and they were eventually removed at 5 p.m.&quot;August 29, 9&apos;40 a.m. As steamship &quot; Wanliu &quot; was discharging passengers at Yunyang, sixteen armed officers and soldiers, with their arms concealed, boarded the ship. At the same time several sampans (small boats) filled with armed soldiers left the shore for the ship. The captain proceeded at slow speed in order to avoid seizure of the ship by these troops, and at once a heavy fire was opened from both banks, while the armed soldiers on board attempted to rush the bridge and engine-room with the intention of stopping the ship. Meanwhile, a sampan with about eight people on board tried to come alongside when the ship was under way, fouled another sampan alongside, and drifted astern in a sinking condition. The soldiers on board seized and tied up the head compradore (supercargo) and threatened to kill the captain. The Chinese alleged that two junks were sunk, fifty-eight soldiers drowned, and 85,000 dollars lost, but this account appears to be grossly exaggerated.August 29, 1&apos;40 p.m. Steamship &quot;Wanliu&quot; arrived at Wanhsien. Armed party from &quot; Cockchafer &quot; disarms and evicts soldiers from &quot;Wanliu.&quot;   &quot;One of
i. ;   &apos;.&apos;.kthem tried, to shoot before he was disarmed.&quot; (Lieutenant-Commander Acheson.) &quot; Two of them wounded on the head by bayonets.&quot; (General Yang.) A short burst from a Lewis gun fired into the water to silence demonstrations on the shore. (Even the Chinese do not allege that this fire caused any casualties. In some of the reports it is alleged that two men were fatally wounded, but these would appear to be the two who, according to General Yang, received bayonet wounds in the head.)There is now a little confusion as to the sequence of events : Lieutenant-Commander Acheson is very emphatic that General Yang placed 400 troops on steamship &quot;Wanhsien &quot; before this firing took place. He also says that at 4 p.m. &quot; Cockchafer &quot; was covered by 800 troops in &quot; Wanhsien &quot; and &quot; Wantung,&quot; but in another place he says that &quot;Wantung&quot; arrived at 6 p.m.; also, General Kuo&apos;s troops left steamship &quot;Wanhsien&quot; at 5p.m. On the whole, it looks as though General Kuo&apos;s troops left the steamer only to be replaced immediately by General Yang&apos;s.The final position that day was that, apart from &quot; Cockchafer &quot; being covered by about 800 armed troops in the &quot; Wanhsien &quot; and &quot; Wantung,&quot; the banks of the river all round the harbour were lined with about 2,000 troops, including two small field guns.August 80. Rear-Admiral, Yang-tsze, gave orders that steps were to be taken to extricate &quot; Cockchafer,&quot; authorising her to deliver an ultimatum to General Yang, and, if necessary, to open fire on points of military importance.His Majesty&apos;s consul at Chungking sent a strong protest to General Yang.Lieutenant-Commander Acheson endeavoured to arrange personal negotiations with General Yang, who replied that he would treat only with His Majesty&apos;s consul, Chungking (Mr. Eastes).The consul-general at Hankow obtained from/Marshal Wu Pei-fu a cypher message to Yang Sen (which &quot;Bee&quot; passed by W/T) instructing him to release the ships and preserve friendly relations. (It would appear to have been on the delivery of this telegram that Yang&apos;s soldiers arrested &quot; Cockchafer&quot; &apos;s interpreter, threatened to murder him and then released him.)August 31. Mr. Eastes left Chungking for Wanhsien in His Majesty&apos;s ship &quot;Widgeon.&quot; His Majesty&apos;s ship &quot;Widgeon&quot; ran aground and had to return to Chungking.   Mr. Eastes continued his journey to Wanhsien in a merchant ship.His Majesty&apos;s Minister instructed His Majesty&apos;s consul-general at Hankow to see Wu Pei-fu and urge him to instruct Yang Sen to withdraw his troops from the steamers. Promise of enquiry and of payment of compensation, if &quot; Wanliu &quot; was proved to be at fault, to be given.September 1. Mr. Eastes arrived at Wanhsien and found that His Majesty&apos;s ship &quot;Cockchafer&quot; had shifted her moorings. Mr. Eastes had his first interview7 with General Yang and protested against the seizure of the two British steamers. General Yang maintained that he was justified in his action on account of the alleged sinking by British steamers of various junks and sampans. This proposi-tion Mr. Eastes refused to admit. He offered, however, to guarantee that the two steamers should be kept in harbour at Wanhsien so long as he himself remained there, in the endeavour to settle matters with General Yang. To this General Yang refused to agree, unless it were guaranteed that the ships should be retained indefinitely pending a final settlement. Mr. Eastes endeavoured vainly to suggest other solutions, but after four hours the interview had reached a deadlock, so that Mr. Eastes informed General Yang that he must telegraph to His Majesty&apos;s Minister for further instructions. General Yang proposed to return Mr. Eastes&apos;s call on board His Majesty&apos;s ship &quot; Cockchafer,&quot; but the offer was curtly refused.September 2. Mr. Eastes&apos;s second interview with General Yang (paragraph 9 of his report). General Yang&apos;s attitude still quite unyielding, though he promised that the steamer&apos;s officers should have full liberty on board and that supplies and coal should be furnished to &quot; Cockchafer.&quot; This promise does not appear to have been fulfilled. Mr. Eastes warned General Yang that extreme measures might be resorted to; the general&apos;s reply was little short of a defiance.His Majesty&apos;s Minister instructed Mr. Eastes to make every possible effort to come to an amicable settlement with General Yang. Mr. Eastes was authorised to agree to the retention of the steamers, under custody of a British man-of-war, pending the arrival of the &quot; Wanliu,&quot; provided the officers were released and the troops withdrawn, and, as a further guarantee, it was proposed that a reasonable [15412] . 0
sum of money should be deposited pending the enquiry. (This telegram reached Hankow on the morning of the 4tli September, so that it cannot have been until some time that day that Mr. Eastes received it, if it ever reached him. Then; is no evidence that Mr. Eastes carried out these instructions.)September 2 (late at night). A telegram in Chinese from Wti Pei-fu to Yang Sen, directing him to release the merchant ships at once, was received on board His Majesty&apos;s ship &quot; Cockchafer.&quot;September 3 (morning). This message was transmitted to General Yang, who answered that he had telegraphed a reply to Marshal Wu direct.September 3, 6 p.m. His Majesty&apos;s ship &quot; Widgeon &quot; arrived at Wanhsien and tied up alongside &quot; Cockchafer.&quot;September 3, 9*15 p.m., G.M.T. (September 4, 5&quot;15 a.m., Ichang times). Telegram sent to His Majesty&apos;s Minister stating that His Majesty&apos;s Government had authorised the use of force as a last resource.September 4 (probably not later than 9 a.m.). Steamship &quot; Kiawo,&quot; with naval crew but no wireless, left Ichang for Wanhsien.September 4. According to the Wai-chiao Pu, Sir R. Macleay called on them and was assured by Admiral Tsai Tingkan (Minister for Foreign Affairs) that instructions for an amicable settlement would be wired to General Yang, and these instructions were sent the same afternoon.September 5 (morning). Considerable numbers of extra troops were sent on board &quot; Wanhsien&quot; and &quot;Wantung,&quot; showing that news of the &quot; Kiawo&apos;s&quot; plans had reached General Yang and that the element of surprise had been lost. &quot; Kiawo &quot; does not appear to have been informed of this.September 5. Commander-in-chief, China, informed Rear-Admiral, Yang-tszc, that on the arrival of the &quot; Kiawo &quot; at Wanhsien it would be desirable for His Majesty&apos;s consul to repeat once more the oiler of an enquiry and guarantees. We have no evidence that these instructions were carried out; they would appear not to have been received.September 5, 6&apos;20 p.m. &quot; Kiawo &quot; arrived at Wanhsien. &quot;Almost before she reached abreast of the &apos; Wanhsien &apos; firing commenced.&quot; &quot; Very early in the fierce engagement a hot fire was directed against His Majesty&apos;s ship &apos; Cockchafer&apos; from all sides, with rifles and machine guns ; several shots penetrated her armour-plating, while at least three field guns were brought into action against her. Under the circumstances, Lieutenant-Commander Aeheson had no option but to bring into action both his 0-inch guns in the endeavour to silence the hostile field guns and also to search out the more important of the many premises in and aroundWanhsien City occupied by Chinese troops.....His Majesty&apos;s ships &apos; Widgeon &apos;and &apos; Cockchafer &apos; managed to roach before nightfall an anchorage some 5 miles below Wanshien, whence was clearly visible the glow of tho kvrge fires started at several points in the city by the bombardment &quot; (Mr. Eastes&apos;s report). A fuller report of the action is necessary, and will no doubt be forthcoming in due course from the Admiralty.British official report put the Chinese losses at less than 100 civilians killed, 140 injured and 20 houses destroyed. According to Chinese official statements more than 100 police or gendarmes were killed, nearly 1,000 civilians killed and wounded, and over 1,000 houses and buildings were destroyed by gunfire. The British casualties were 3 officers and 4 seamen killed, and 2 officers and 13 seamen wounded; one of the mercantile marine officers lost his life in an attempt [to escape. The remaining 5 officers were rescued, but it was found impossible to remove the detained steamers.September 5, after 8*10 p.m. His Majesty&apos;s Minister telegraphed to Rear-Admiral, Yang-tsze, that he expected His Majesty&apos;s consul to make final effort for amicable settlement, on lines laid down on the 2nd September, before force was actually used.   This telegram was, of course, too late to be acted upon.Subsequently negotiations were initiated at Ichang between Rear-Admiral Cameron and Yang Sen&apos;s representative, and on the 19th September it was reported that the return of the steamers, through a neutral (American) intermediary, had been agreed to.September 25.  Steamship &quot;Wantung&quot; arrived at Ichang and was handed over to her owners.
September 29. British gunboats left Ichang to resume their normal duties with their base at Chungking.The incident has so far had no repercussions except locally. But in Szechuan, and particularly in Chungking (which was for a month without a British consul and also without its usual British naval patrol) there has been considerable anti-British agitation. The situation became so aggravated that on the 17th September all British women and children were evacuated. An anti-British boycott has been started there, and there has also been considerable looting and destruction of British property. There has also been considerable anti-British agitation in Chengtu, which is ten days overland from Chungking and where there is a very large community of British missionaries (principally Canadian) and, in view of geographical conditions and the impossibility of affording direct protection, it has been necessary to consider seriously the question of their withdrawal.&quot;While the Wanhsien episode has stirred up Szechuan feeling to such a pitch as to become a genuine threat to the existence of British interests, in that province, it cannot be said to have achieved anything towards the removal of the causes that led up to it. The commandeering of steamers continued, and has now reached such a point that steamers have practically ceased running.Proposals have been put forward for the investigation of the Wanhsien incident by a joint diplomatic enquiry. His Majesty&apos;s Minister has been authorised to consent to such an investigation or, at his discretion, to propose it. If the enquiry is to be held, it appears highly desirable that the terms of reference should be comprehensive and admit of the consideration of all causes of hostility to and interference with British steamers on the Upper Yang-tsze. His Majesty&apos;s Minister has also been instructed to report as to the desirability of making a small compassionate grant to the civilian sufferers of Wanhsien.A strong section of local opinion urges that the problems of the Upper Yang-tsze can only be settled by means of strong action, which, it is suggested, might take the form of a blockade of Szechuan. Owing to the fact that practically the whole of the external trade of Szechuan is carried by the River Yang-tsze, a blockade could be made effective with, a minimum of force, but, owing to the self-contained nature of the province, the cessation of external trade would not be a fatal, or even a serious, blow, and the blockade would have to be continued for months before it would have any beneficial effect. The effects of the blockade would first make themselves felt in the salt trade, and would therefore react directly on the militarists of Szechuan, who derive the bulk of their revenue from the salt taxes, but the stoppage of the export from Szechuan would mean that the supply for Hupeh was cut off, and the blockade would immediately foment anti-British movements in that province, thus spreading rather than curbing the trouble.Moreover, it would be fatal to initiate a blockade without first withdrawing all British subjects from Szechuan a step which appears distinctly paradoxical as a means of maintaining British interests.V. Denunciation of Treaties by China.The Peking Government has embarked upon a course of &quot; denouncing,&quot; when-ever they fall due, the &quot; unequal &quot; treaties concluded with foreign Powers. Further, when the right of denunciation applies only to certain (e.g., tariff) clauses in the treaty, the Chinese Government nevertheless assume the right to denounce the whole treaty, including the exterritorial clauses.This policy of treaty denunciation began with the notice given to the French Government on the 4th February, 1926, that the time had come for a revision of the conventions of the 25th April, 1886, the 26th June, 1887 (with additional commercial convention of the same date), and the 20th June, 1895 all dealing with trade and customs arrangements on the Indo-China frontier. The French Minister, on receiving this note, questioned whether the provincial authorities and people of the Province of Yunnan, who enjoyed certain special privileges under the treaties, had been consulted, and also doubted whether the present Peking Government was in a position to denounce a treaty with a foreign Power and to conclude a new one. We have no further information as to the attitude of the French Government regarding these conventions, but the Peking Government have recently given orders that, in [15412] nSeptember 28. Steamship &quot; &quot;Wanhsien &quot; arrived at Ichang and was handed
consequence of the discontinuance of the conventions, the full rate of customs duties should be henceforth collected on the frontier. The putting into effect of these orders has, however, been postponed.On the 6th! April, 1926, the Chinese Government proposed to the Belgian Government a radical revision of the treaty of the 2nd November, 1865, on the ground of article 46, whereby, if the Belgian Government desired modifications in any of the clauses of the treaty, they could open negotiations at the end of a ten-year period, after giving six months&apos; notice to the Chinese Government of their intention. The Belgian Government contested the right of the Chinese Government to propose any modifications of the treaty under this article, but they accepted the possibility of finding a modus vivendi which, while recognising the interests of Belgium, would not adversely affect the legitimate rights of China (note of the 21st August, 1926). The Belgian Charge d&apos;Affaires in London enquired privately as to the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and was informed that, according to our legal expert, the question of &quot; denouncing &quot; could not arise out of article 46 or any other article in the treaty, and that it was undesirable for the Belgians to admit that, failing an agreement for revision, the treaty would terminate; even the proposal for a modus vivendi seemed rather dangerous. The point is of importance to us, because under article 27 of the Anglo-Chinese Treaty of Tien-tsin (the 26th June, 1858) either party can demand a revision of the tariff and of the &quot; commercial articles &quot; of the treaty at the end of every period of ten years, and, if this means that, failing agreement as to such revision, the provisions in question will come to an end, the Chinese Government would be, as against us, in a much better position than they are as against Belgium, to get rid of all the provisions which may be regarded as coming under the phrase &quot; the commercial articles of this treaty.&quot;The proposal for a modus vivendi broke down, since the Belgians had suggested that it should continue for periods of six months at a time, such periods being indefinitely renewable, while China demanded that if the negotiations did not result in a settlement at the end of the first six months they should be free to give three months&apos; notice of the termination of the modus vivendi. The Belgian Government then invited the Chinese Government to lay the question in dispute before The Hague Tribunal. This proposal China has also rejected on the ground that the issue is not the technical interpretation of article 46, but the application of the principle of equality of treatment, which cannot be made the subject of judicial enquiry. On the 6th November Dr. Koo, the Chinese Foreign Minister (who is also Premier), announced that the 1865 treaty must be considered to have come to an end. At the same time, he issued a mandate instructing the Government departments and the provincial authorities to draw up regulations for &quot; full protection of the Belgian Legation, consulates, nationals, products and ships, in accordance with international law and custom.&quot; The Belgian Government have now stated that they will them-selves in any case submit the matter to The Hague.The Chino-Japanese Commercial Treaty of the 21st July, 1896, came to the end of one of its ten-year periods on the 20th October. Article 26 of this treaty provides that either of the contracting parties may demand a revision of the tariffs and of the commercial articles at the end of such decennial periods. The Chinese note expressed the wish to enter into negotiations for a radical revision on an equal footing of the whole commercial treaty, and concluded by stating that, if revision were not effected within the six months referred to in article 26, the Chinese Government reserved all their rights in the matter. The Japanese Government replied on the 10th November, expressing their readiness to enter into negotiations for treaty revision, but refusing to accept the Chinese reservation regarding the situation which would arise if the new treaty were not concluded within six months. The actual intentions of the Japanese Government are still obscure, and there is every reason to believe that they find themselves in a quandary.This new campaign of treaty revision piecemeal represents the methods and policies of the Peking Foreign Office and of Dr. Wellington Koo. They are doubtless straining and overstraining the text of the treaties, both in the Belgian and Japanese instances; and they are breaking away from the procedure laid down in the Washington treaties (of which China was a signatory) for gradual treaty revision in consultation with the principal Powers together. But, as the Chinese Charge d&apos;Affaires recently stated at the Foreign Office in a private conversation, the Chinese consider that the fulfilment of the Washington promises has been so long delayed that the treaties are to some extent invalidated, and they are losing patience. There is no doubt that Dr. Koo&apos;s attitude is supported by all Chinese people, and that he hopes to win personal popularity thereby.
VI. Piracy.Owing to the disturbed conditions of China, brigandage and piracy are rife. There have always been pirates in South China, but their activities have recently been especially daring. The usual method is for a gang of pirates to come on board a ship as part of the usual mob of steerage passengers. They have smuggled their arms on board, and at a certain moment, they seize the ship, and force the officers to navigate it to Bias Bay the pirates&apos; headquarters near Hong Kong where the pirates escape with their loot in the ship&apos;s boats, and leave the ship to its own devices. A paper recently submitted to the Cabinet (C.I.D. Paper No. 283-C of the 8th November, 1926) gives details of 17 piracies committed by the Bias Bay gang since 1921, including 7 in 1926 (totals which have now been raised to 19 and 9 respectively).In various ways it has been attempted to make British ships secure against attack by pirates; and in the Committee of Imperial Defence paper mentioned above will be round a statement of Admiralty instructions regarding pursuit of pirates. His Majesty&apos;s ships have for many years been active in chasing pirates on the seas and rivers of South China, and on one occasion at least have co-operated with Chinese troops in an attack against, pirates on land. But the Admiralty instructions specifically forbid the landing of officers and men on Chinese territory to search for or attack pirates, and provide that when pirates are once on shore fire can only be opened on them at the request of Chinese officials through His Britannic Majesty&apos;s consul and in co-operation with Chinese authorities.The increase in the Bias Bay piracies caused the Governor of Hong Kong, in June 1926, to submit to the Colonial Office the following recommendation :  &quot; When next a piracy in Bias Bay is reported, it is proposed that two companies of a British regiment should be immediately despatched with such naval escort as may be available in accordance with a plan which is being prepared by the naval and military authorities. The expedition would proceed at once to the anchorage in Bias Bay, where pirated ships are moored, and would there land and endeavour to waylay the pirates while removing their loot. The troops would also search the pirate villages, and, if necessary, destroy them.&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Minister, Peking, concurred generally in this suggestion, but would have preferred to see the occupation of Bias Bay by a small garrison, rather than the destruction of villages. He recommended that the Canton Government&quot;1^&apos; be warned forthwith that action would be taken after the next piracy unless they them-selves acted meanwhile.The Foreign Office, though concurring generally, have become increasingly anxious especially in view of the Wanhsien affair as to possible repercussions throughout China from punitive action by British troops; and in view of any interest which the League of Nations may take in the matter, they think that His Majesty&apos;s Government should be sure of their position in regard to international law. But they were prepared to instruct the acting consul-general at once to warn the Canton Government on the lines suggested by His Majesty&apos;s Minister. These instructions were referred to the Colonial Office for concurrence, and by them to the Committee of Imperial Defence. They are the subject of OLD. Paper No. 283-C referred to above; but they have not yet been approved.Meanwhile, on the 16th November, a further piracy was committed against the British steamship &quot;Sunning&quot; by the Bias Bay gang, and, according to the first* An recently as last October, the Canton Government informed the acting consul-general of their desire to protect foreign vessels against pirates and outlined a procedure for convoying such steamers by the Cantonese navy (&quot; decrepit launches with very inadequate armaiaent, which are themselves in danger of capture by priatcs&quot;).The British Treaty of Tien-tsin is due for revision (as regards the tariff and com-mercial articles only), at the demand of either party, on the 24th October, 1930 ; the Mackay Treaty of the 5th September, 1902, may be revised as regards the tariff, at the demand of either party, on the 28th July, 1933; the American Commercial Treaty, which corresponds to our Mackay Treaty, may be revised in its entirety, at the demand of either party, on the 7th December, 1934. But if the Japanese Govern-ment give way to the present Chinese demand, there can be little doubt that we and the Americans will be faced by requests for similar radical revision before those dates fall due.
reports, two European women passengers had been carried off. That evening, the-Admiral Commander-in-chief telegraphed : &quot;I have sanctioned parties being landed in Chinese territory if necessary and consider, in view of frequent use of Bias Bay as base for piracies, including French steamer &apos; Hanoi &apos; on the 12th November, that action may be necessary to destroy pirate village in Bias Bay (a) if women not recovered and Hong Kong police officials recommend it as the only course to enforce their being surrendered, or (b) if it can be proved from pirates already caught that pirates belong to one special village.&quot;This action was approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government on the 17th November. But on the same day a further telegram was received from the Commander-in-chief as follows :- &apos;&quot;Prisoners state pirate gang consisted of twenty-two men. Reports received up to present are somewhat conflicting, but it appears probable practically all pirates have been accounted for, and that only person missing is passenger who is half-caste British subject, possibly killed or drowned. Naval units have been recalled to Hong Kong.&quot;The immediate and pressing question of the rescue of the &quot;Sunning&apos;s&quot; passengers has therefore solved itself without necessitating a landing on Chinese territory a proposal which, in view of the excited condition of China, was regarded at the Foreign Office with some alarm.The general question as to how to deal with the Bias Bay pirates, however, remains. It is now before the Committee of Imperial Defence to decide whether the proposed warning should be addressed to the Canton Government, and, if this warning (as is probable) produces no results, what practical plan of action should be laid down. But before that plan is carried out, the Foreign Office wish to be consulted again as to whether the time and the action are opportune.V. WELLESLEY.Foreign Office, November 23, 1926.o
