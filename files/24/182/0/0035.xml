[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1926.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 410 (26).CABINET.INTERDEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON GRANTS.SECOND REPORT.To the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury. May it please your Lordships,1. The Committee was directed by Cabinet 60 (26), Conclusion 7 to work out a scheme for a general block grant to cover all services except roads.2. We conceive it to be our duty, in accordance with this instruction, to devise a formula for a unified block grant for Health, Education and Police services, irrespective of any individual opinions we may hold as to the relative advantages or disadvantages of a general as compared with a service grant system. As pointed out in paragraph 21 of our former Report, the question whether the administrative difficulties of a general grant can be overcome will require further examination; and some of us feel that we ought to record the view that, apart from the respective merits or demerits of the two systems, the unified grant would be politically difficult to carry if it involves a radical interference with the status and functions of the minor local authorities who at present receive direct grants from the Exchequer.3. State assistance is at present given to Health, Education and Police services in two ways :(i) through the Assigned Revenues System, about  6,300,000 of which  1,240,000 represents Local- Taxation Licences collected by the Local Authorities.(II) by direct grants voted annually about  46,000,000but in addition to these grants specifically related to the particular services, localauthorities receive aid from the Exchequer in the form of-(iii) the unallocated balances on the Exchequer Contribution Accounts of county and County Borough Councils-about  2,500,000.(iv) the   Agricultural   Rates   Grants   to   all   spending   authorities about 4,300,000.4. Any new system of grants calculated to distribute a total sum equal to that distributed under the four forms of assistance enumerated above will necessarily involve the consequence that some authorities will gain, and others will lose on the transition. The greater the need for reform in the existing basis, the larger will be the alteration in the distribution. We have assumed that it would be necessary for reasons of policy to guarantee against loss the authorities which would otherwise receive a lower total of grants, and our calculations have consequently assumed an additional Exchequer grant equal generally speaking to the sum total of the deficiencies.5. The incidence of those deficiencies will naturally be on those authorities which are most highly favoured under the present system.   Authorities which spend[15504]        &apos; b
at an exceptionally high rate, whether from choice or necessity, and receive Exchequer grants calculated as a high percentage of that expenditure are likely to lose when the Exchequer grants are not calculated on an expenditure basis; and in a redistribution of Assigned Revenues, which have for nearly 40 years been allocated on the facts applicable to 1888, Authorities the population of which has greatly increased since 1888 are likely to gain at the expense of those where the population has been relatively stationary.6. One of our principal difficulties has been to devise a formula which, while in itself equitable, would not result in fantastically high individual deficiencies. If we have not wholly surmounted this difficulty,&apos; it is owing to the bewildering variations per head of population of the grants &quot;at present paid.7. We recognised the obvious advantage of using a formula, the principles of which have already been communicated to and discussed with representative associa-tions of local authorities. We therefore first examined the possibility of applying to the wider field indicated by the. Cabinet Minute the formula for the Block grant in respect of Health and Poor Law Services which forms part of the financial proposals of the Minister of Health in connection with the scheme for the reform of the Poor Law.8.   These proposals are made up of three parts : In the first place the proceeds of such of the Local Taxation Licence Duties as remain leviable by the Councils of Counties and County Boroughs are to be retained by the Councils ( 1,240,000).In the second place a sum ( 4,300,000) equivalent to the average of the aggregate Agricultural Rates Acts Grants paid in the three years preceding the date on which the scheme takes effect is to be distributed among the rating authorities at a uniform rate per   of assessable value, of agricultural land.The remainder of the grants covered by the Scheme ( 6,500,000) are to be distributed on a formula based on population modified by a factor of assessable value representing partly the ability of the, area to pay and partly the character of the area, any area which loses being allowed to retain its present grants.The principles embodied in this formula are the same as those discussed in our previous Report in regard to a General grant. No Local Government area is regarded as more meritorious than another or deserving of higher Exchequer grants by reason only of the amount of the expenditure it incurs or the quality of the services it renders.9. The Ministry of Health formula is based on the following method. The average Assessable Value per head of population throughout England and Wales having been determined, a calculation is made showing by what percentage the authorities with assessable value below the average are below the average. The population of each such authority&apos;s area is then recalculated by the addition to it of the corresponding percentage of its population. The population of the areas, the assessable value of which is not below the average, is taken at the actual figure. The total existing grants are then divided by the total hypothetical population as so arrived at, and by this means a standard grant per head is determined. This grant is distributed to each authority on the basis of its population (hypothetical, if below, and actual, if not below, the average assessable value per head). As this reallocation of grants brings a certain number of authorities into deficiency as corn-pared with their existing grants, the grants to such authorities are then raised to their existing figure, so that no authority should lose by the transition.10. We are satisfied after detailed examination that the Ministry of Health formula could not be applied to a general grant without modification. It appeared to us doubtful whether population alone was the best measure of the need for Exchequer assistance in the case of a general grant two-thirds of which would be applied towards the cost of education. Further, the formula was designed partly to give special assistance to the more heavily burdened industrial counties and county boroughs, but the weight given in the formula to relative riches and poverty, although appropriate within the limited field of health grants, appeared to be unduly high for the distribution of a general grant, covering Health, Education and Police Services.11. We therefore considered what modifications of the formula could be adopted to provide a suitable method for the distribution of a general grant of nearly  60 millions.
12. We propose to embody in our scheme the proposal of the Ministry of Health that the proceeds of the local taxation licence duties* which are still leviable by local authorities should be retained by them and should not be brought into account in the general grant; but we consider that in the distribution of a general grant it is possible to avoid the earmarking of a part of it in any way as in respect of agri-cultural land, and we propose, therefore, that the whole of the balance of the money available should be distributed as one sum in aid of the three services.II.13. After much consideration of various schemes we have decided to submit two alternative methods of distribution, of which the first is favoured by a majority of the Committee.14. This method has regard to general characteristics only, and takes no account of the actual amount or character of the expenditure in each area or of peculiar local conditions or of the degree of development of any particular service in the area. It provides for the distribution of the grant at a uniform rate per head of hypothetical population built up of actual population weighted by a factor representing ability to pay and of the number of children attending elementary schools. Equal weight is given to population and to the number of school children, but the weighting for low assessable value is one-quarter only of the weighting adopted in the Ministry of Health formula.15.   The formula of distribution is as follows :(a) where the assessable value per head of population of the area falls short of the average assessable value per head of population increase the popula-tion of the area by half the percentage by which the assessable value per head of population of the area falls short of the average; in other cases take the actual population as a basis without modification :(6) increase the average number of children attending elementary schools in each area in the proportion which the population of the country bears to the aggregate average number of children attending elementary schools :(c) ascertain a denominator for each area by adding to the population as determined under (a) the number ascertained under (6); and distribute the total grant available for the country at a uniform rate in proportion to the denominator as so determined.16. Before summarising the effect of this scheme on the various authorities (which is given in more detail in Appendix I), we would again draw attention to the great variations in the grants at present in payment. In some cases the grants now in payment exceed 40s. per head of population, in others they are little more than 2Qs., and these variations do not bear any clear relation to gradations of wealth and poverty. It necessarily follows that the grants payable under any formula which takes account only of population and other general factors, and which bears no relation to actual expenditure, will vary widely from the present grants in many cases. Where the grants resulting from the application of the formula are less than the average grants paid in the three years preceding the year of change, we propose that the Authorities should be guaranteed against any reduction, the grants under the formula being made up to that average. Therefore, although we refer to &quot; losses &quot; in the succeeding paragraphs, there will be no actual reduction, but at the most stabilisation at the average figure of the years before the change. The &quot; gains,&quot; however, will represent real increases, and the total of these increases will thus be the cost of the scheme, which works out at approximately  4 million.17. The summary given below is based on calculations made on the grant figures for 1924-25. If the scheme were actually introduced it would probably be based on the grants for the three years 1927 to 1929, and some changes both in total and distribution must be expected in the meanwhile. The figures probably give a very fair indication of the general effect of the scheme, but too much weight should not be attached to individual figures, which are given for purposes of illustration. Moreover, the introduction of new valuations about 1930 may have a considerable effect on the distribution under the formula.* Duties on licences to deal in game, licences to kill game, licences for dogs, guns, armorial bearings and male servants.
18. The general effect of this scheme is to benefit very materially the industrial parts of the country, particularly those in which the assessable value is low.19. Of the 82 Countv Boroughs, 66 would gain to the extent of approximately  1,850,000, and 16 would lose to the extent of about  360,000. The principal gainers are among the poorest Boroughs which stand in the greatest need of further assistance, e.g., South Shields ( 73,000), Grimsby ( 42,000), Barnsley ( 33,000), Gateshead ( 69,000), West Bromwich ( 35,000), and Walsall ( 43,000). Of the &quot; losses &quot; only 6 exceed  10,000, and they are for the most part confined to large and wealthy cities such as Manchester and Bradford which have been able to afford an exceptionally high standard of service.20. Of the 61 Counties, 29 would gain just over  2 million and 32 would &quot;lose &quot;  1^ million. It is among the counties that the existing grants show the widest and most illogical variations, the highest grants being generally those of counties whose population has remained comparatively stationary since 1888, and which receive the largest grants under the Agricultural Rates Acts. These are generally, therefore, the &quot;losers,&quot; and in some cases the &quot;losses&quot; are proportionately very heavy, e.g., Montgomery ( 31,000), Radnor ( 13,000), Lincoln (Holland) ( 38,000), Merioneth ( 19,000), Rutland ( 8,000), and the East Riding of Yorkshire ( 70,000). Middlesex also &quot;loses &quot; substantially for rather different reasons, but this case can be substantially met by the adjustment referred to in paragraph 23 below. The more industrial counties, on the other hand, gain largely; e.g., Durham ( 256,000), Lancashire ( 318,000), Staffordshire ( 191,000) and the West Riding of Yorkshire ( 213,000). Objection may be taken to the very wide variations between the grants under the formula and the existing grants to County Councils. We recognise that these variations add to the practical difficulties of applying the scheme; but they are due more to the anomalies of the present arrange-ments than to defects of principle in our proposals, and the difficulties that arise are such as must attend any endeavour to introduce equitable uniformity in this field.21. London stands in a class by itself. The grants now in payment ( 9,200,000) represent 40s. 2d. per head of population, about 30 per cent, above the average. If the formula outlined above were applied without modification to London, the appropriate grant would be 29s. Id. a head, a &quot;loss&quot; of 10s. 7d., or  2,400,000, and similar results must follow from all formulas based on a uniform rate of grant. The high level of present grants does not represent, as in the case of certain Counties, an anomaly of the assigned revenue system. It is due to an exceptionally high level of expenditure, particularly on Police, which is in part unavoidable and caused by London&apos;s unique position.22. Special consideration is necessary in the case of London, not only on account of the heavy &quot;loss &quot; which would result from the unmodified application of the formula (due in part to the high level of necessary expenditure, particularly on police, to which we have just alluded), but also because, so far as regards the Metropolitan Police District, the respective local authorities have no control whatever over the expenditure on the police. In the case of all forces the. main conditions of service are governed by Home Office Regulations of general application, and in this way the Home Office possesses a considerable measure of control over the level of police expenditure, but in the case of the Metropolitan Police expenditure (35 per cent, of the whole expenditure on police in England and Wales) the Secretary of State determines, without reference to the local authorities, not only the conditions of service but also the strength of the force and all other questions of expenditure.23. If the principle of the General Grant were pressed to its logical conclusion in the case of the Metropolitan Police, the Local Authorities would be called upon to find that part of the cost which is now borne by the Exchequer, in consideration of receiving a general grant based, so far as the police service is concerned, on a far lower average cost than that which they were called upon to meet. We doubt if such a proposal could be defended; and the existence of the Metropolitan Police Eorce gives a ground for recognising the exceptional position of London by an adjustment in respect of police which would reduce the &quot; loss &quot; resulting from the unmodified application of the formula to a level which we regard as defensible.24. The particulars of a method of adjustment which has been suggested to us are contained in Appendix II, but the method to be adopted will require further consideration.
25. The scheme which we have set forth in the preceding paragraphs is based, as we have explained, exclusively on general characteristics; even the element of school attendance being employed not in order to calculate a special education section of the grant but merely as a corrective of the population figure as modified by the assessable value.26. Although this basis is founded on a conception of the relations between National and Local finance which differs from that commonly accepted, some of us believe that it is the key to far-reaching reforms of local administration, and that only by placing the Government subventions to Local Authorities on a basis entirely independent of the details and results of local administration can local government realise the full measure of its usefulness.27. It is fight to mention, however, that opinion within the Committee is not unanimous in favour of adopting general characteristics as the sole basis of grant, and such a basis would doubtless be subjected to much criticism both in Parliament and by Local Authorities,iti.28. We have been led to suggest an alternative method, which combines the population and assessable value factors with further factors referable to different services, by the consideration that if it is found necessary to negotiate a com-prehensive basis with local authorities for Police, Education and Health, the time may prove too short to enable a Bill to be drafted and introduced early next session.29.   A formula such as we have in mind might for example be : X shillings per unit of population, corrected by some factor of rateable or assessable value per head (in respect of poor law and public health services), plus Y shillings per head of teachers or school places (in respect of education), plus Z shillings per constable (in respect of police).A composite formula of this kind like those already discussed would have the advantage of tending to cancel out the losses and gains which would result from the separate application of each of these factors to the three services with which we are now concerned. On the other hand, it would not be easy to justify the adoption of such a scheme in preference to a scheme of separate service grants in the absence of a common factor.30. Some of us think that a solution of this difficulty may be found (i) by the adoption of population and assessable value as factors common to all three services; and (ii) by the addition of special factors directly referable to each of the services.31. Minute examination and careful discussion will be required before the selection of the appropriate factors and the precise weight which should be attached to them can be finally determined, but the method may be illustrated in the following manner, by reference to the Grants for Education and Police: (a.) The existing Grants,* which are at present   s. d.Elementary Education   ....   31,801,624=16 9 per headHigher ....     6,561,244^ 3 6,,     ,,Police........ ....     8,838,4^ 4 8,,     ,,are divided into two portions (not necessarily in the same proportions for each Grant) which may be denoted by Ei and E3, Hi and H2 and Pi and P2 respectively. Ei and Hi might, for example, be taken as one-half or two-thirds of the respective Education Grants, and Pi might be taken as two-thirds of the total Police Grant, which would represent approxi-mately the Grant which would be payable if the lowest police establish-raent in proportion to population ruled throughout the country.   .   .* The figures exclude Agricultural Kates Act Grant, but include Residue Grant, Higher Education. They exclude grants in respect of Training Colleges. They include grants to Non-Local Education Authority Institutions. .[If) 504] c
(6.) The portions Ex, Hi and Pi are aggregated and the aggregate amount j (Ei + H1 + Pi) of grant is distributed on the basis of hypothetical population, e.g., in the manner described in the earlier paragraphs of this Report. If two-thirds to one-third were the proportion adopted in the case of each Grant, there would thus be a total amount of ^31,467,519 of Grant to be divided in this manner for these two Services Education and Police.(c.) The remaining portions of the several Grants are distributed On the basis of specific factors relating to the several Services, for instance -The remainder of the Elementary Education Grant (E2) in proportion to the number of elementary teachers on the authorised establishments.Tlie remainder of the Higher Education Grant (H2) in propor-tion to the number of pupils in Secondary Schools.The remainder of the Police Grants (P2) in proportion to the number by which the strength of each force, within the authorised establishment, exceeds one-thousandth of the population.32. It is claimed that a scheme on these lines would have the following advantages: : (a.) The Minister of Health&apos;s proposals need not be postponed or altered, -v-   inasmuch as these proposals would be merely a first instalment of the complete scheme into which they would ultimately be inerged. (b.) The Government would be in a position, when introducing their proposals for poor law and public health .reform next session, to announce a comprehensive policy of grant reform. .;(c.):Time would be given for negotiations with the Local Authorities in &quot; regard to the special factors applicable to the various services.&apos; (d.) The final completion of the formula could be postponed until near the date (1930) at which it is to come into operation, thus allowing time for the selection of the factors and the determination of the values to be given to them in the light of the development of the services between how and 1930 and of the actual needs of the situation at the &apos;  latest possible date, (e.) Under the alternative scheme it would be possible, if the Government thought it desirable, to provide a special adjustment for the liquidation of any service commitments, such as those in regard to the salaries of teachers under the Burnham award, which might not be covered by the application of the formula. (/.) If it should ultimately be found desirable for any reason to abandon a general block grant system in favour of separate service grants&apos;, the &apos; ; ..- door would still be open.:-i  ; (f/.) And, finally; the scheme could, if it were thought desirable, be so arranged ; &quot; &apos;           as to give direct financial encouragement to development.   We. deal with this particular question in the succeeding paragraph.     .....33. We recognise that this question of development may be regarded from two points of view. On the one hand, it may be urged that it is one of the main objects of the&quot; block grant system to allow complete freedom of initiative in this respect to localgovernment authorities andexeept as regards guidance and persuasion to release them.from Whitehall control or interference. On the other hand, there are some of us who think that the time has not yet arrived for such a complete transfer of responsibility, that it is wasteful and indefensible to provide money which, instead of being devoted to development, might, if a Local Authority so wished, be used solely for the relief of their rates (it is by no means improbable that this would occur most frequently, not in the highly rated and progressive districts, but in the low rated and improgressive), and that the Government, while properly abandoning tlie meticulous supervision of expenditure which&apos; is involved in the present percentage grant system, should still retain some control, over the direction of policy by means of Exchequer grants. Such control could be maintained in more than one way. It could., be-.-maintained by introducing in the grant formula a factor, the application - of which would encourage development in a particular direction, e.g., a factor related to the
number of Secondary School places in excess of a given standard. It could also be maintained by setting aside a separate sum specifically allocated to development, e.g., a non-recurrent building grant. The choice between these two points of view is a matter on which we do not feel called upon to give an opinion. AVe would merely point out that the alternative scheme which we have suggested does make it possible for the Government to preserve their financial control of development.34. It may be objected that the proposals outlined in this part of our report do not, in view of their tentative character, fully comply with the terms of the Cabinet reference to us, and some of us think (a) that until they take a more definite form and are worked out in terms ofactual grants it is impossible to say how far they would be practicable ;(b) that the greater the weight given to factors peculiar to the respectiveservices, the stronger will be the tendency for the general grant to split into separate service grants ;(c) that the selection of factors intended to encourage specific development incertain directions does not appear to be consistent with the principle of a general block grant, and would lead to continual demands for revision of the basis of grant.(d) that the tactical advantages claimed for this method a question whichis not strictly within the scope of this Committee would probably be offset by the difficulties to which the delay in producing a complete . scheme would give rise. -,. -:&apos;IV.35. We have not attempted in this Report to deal with the administrative difficulties, to which we alluded in our second paragraph, inherent in any General Grant scheme. ; - &apos;36. - In the administration of any such scheme, arrangements would have to be made to secure that adequate-&quot; sanctions &quot; were provided. Payment of grant would be&quot; conditional on the receipt of certificates from the Departments responsible, for the services covered by the grant that the services had been efficiently and satisfactorily carried out, and it would be necessary to take powers to make an abatement from the total grant normally: payable if any &quot;Department found it necessary to qualify its certificate.36.&apos; This is a point to which the Hprue Office attach particular importance in relation to the. Police. In this service, as already mentioned, the Home Office at present exercise a measure of control-over the level of expenditure which is-absolute as respects the Metropolitan Police and predominant in the case of other forces. They consider it essential; that they shoidd maintain their control unimpaired as regards both the enforcement of efficiency requirements and the conditions of service of all forces, and that they should be empowered under any Grant system that may be adopted to impose upon a recalcitrant Police Authority, without-delay, a forfeiture of grant sufficient to ensure compliance with their regulations or other requirements as to efficiency, conditions of service or discipline. :39.. - Another administrative question is that of the Minor Authorities, he., the ; Part til Education Authorities and the Non-County Borough Police Authorities. Our calculations: have necessarily been based on the assumption that County Councils and County Boroughs alone will be the authorities to which the primary distribution will be made. But unless it is proposed that these smaller authorities shall cease to function, a secondary distribution will become necessary within the County area. ;40.   In conclusion we desire to express our appreciation of the services of our secretary, Mr. E. Hale, whose work has been of tire greatest assistance to us.-  (Signed on behalf of the Committee), ;   * &apos;  &apos; G. L.

APPENDIX II.Adjustment of the General Grant payable under Method I on account of the Special Police Arrangements in the Metropolitan Police District.-AT present one-half the cost of the Metropolitan Police Force is met by an Exchequer grant and the other half is levied under precept from the Home Secretary by an equal rate over the District. The relief to the rates afforded by the present grant is shown per head of population in Column 3 below. Column 4 shows the total of the existing grants for other services than police.Under the formula for the genex*al grant the various authorities would receive inclusive grants covering police services at the rates shown in Column 5, and it would be necessary to arrange for payments to be made out of these inclusive sums to the Metropolitan Police Fund in respect of police.Instead of such payments being calculated, say, at rates roughly equivalent to those in Column 3, it is proposed that they should be calculated at the average rate per head of the present grant for extra-Metropolitan police forces, viz., 3/8. These payments would be made up to one half of the total cost of the Metropolitan Police by a special Exchequer grant to the Police Fund, the remaining half being raised as now by rates.This would leave the authorities in question with an inclusive grant for other services than police at the rates shown in Column 6, and the resulting loss or gain on the present grants is shown in Column 7. The last four counties mentioned in the table lie partly within and partly without the Police District and Column 8 averages the total result of the General Grant as adjusted in this way over each county.The adjustment involves additional grants to Greater London over and above those given by the formula of about . 1,830,000, but about  1,630,000 of this goes in reduction of deficiency grants which would otherwise be payable, thus reducing the net cost of the adjustment to about  200,000.Area. 1.	to Total present Grants.
