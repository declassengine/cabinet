In general, I am in agreement with the statements contained in the memorandum by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and, subject to what is said below, with the suggestion made in the covering note to that memorandum.It is clear that the only practioal question,to be considered at the present time is whether agriculture in England and Wales should be insured against unemployment by means of some special arrangement Independent of the general scheme;     in view of the reports there can be no question either of insuring Scottish agriculture or of including agriculture In England and Wales within the general scheme of Unemployment Insurance,     In my view, the result of the reference to Sir Henry Rewrs Committee, particularly having regard to the personnel of the Minority, and the attitude adopted by the Council of Agriculture for England since the publication of the reports make It quite clear that the answer to the question whether there should be Unemployment Insurance for England and Wales must be in the negative at the present time.       The evidence of the extent of unemployment amongst agricultural workers on which the Majority Report Is based, Is not reliable;    It is doubtful how far the workers&apos; representa-tives on the Committee were really representative of agricultural workers j       and it is obvious that a Special Scheme would have no chance whateverTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT) * SECRET.

whatever without a measure &apos; of oo-operation between the two parties which is at present entirely lacking.   I 3hould suggest, subject to what is said below, that the Government should announce that it is Impossible to make further progress in the matter unless and until the industry can compose its own differences of opinion and is prepared to put forward proposals supported by a substantial majority of those concerned.As it is possible and necessary to come to a decision in the. light of the attitude of the parties concerned, I do not think that I need comment in more detail upon the specific proposals of the Majority Report.    I would only say in passing, in this connection, that as far as I can see the risk of demoralisation would be very strong in view of the wages payable in the industry) that the proposed State.contribution would require a good deal of examination;    that similarly the proposal for administration by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries would need very close examination;    and that I am not at all clear that tVB administra-tion of a Special Scheme for the industry in question could be undertaken without a good deal heavier expense than has perhaps been contemplated by the Majority Report.There is one consideration which has a bearing on the proposal made by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,   The Cabinet will be aware that a Committee under Lord Blanesbergh is at present considering the whole subject of Unemployment Insurance with a view to recommending any necessary revision of the scheme. The question of the scope of the general scheme Is obviously a matter which will come under their consideration, and part of the question of general scope is of course the question to what extent
exceptions, either of industries or of classes of individuals, should be permitted.     I understand that hitherto Lord 31anesburgh&apos;s Committee has not very closely considered the question of agricul-ture, as that has been the subject of the deliberations of Sir Henry Rev?&apos; s Committee.     It seems clear, however, that the question of agriculture ought to be taken into consideration by the Committee which deals with the general question of Unemployment Insurance, and it would appear desirable that the conclusions of Sir Henry Rew&apos;s Committee and any developments arising therefrom should be in front of the Slanesburgh Committee before its report is made.     If it can be avoided I should deprecate the Government announcing its decision with regard to a certain portion of the field Of Unemployment Insurance while the Blanesburgh Committee is still considering the general question.     I would therefore suggest that the announcement which I propose above should be made by the Government on the subject of agricultural Unemployment Insurance should not be made until the 31anesburgh Committee have reported (when it may be necessary, although I do not anticipate that it 7/111 be necessary, to reconsider the desirability of the announcement) and that if it becomes necessary in the meantime to make any statement with regard to the Government&apos;s policy about agricultural Unemployment Insurance the statement ohould be to the effect that the Government have received Sir Henry Rew&apos;s report but will not be in a position to announce a decision until the report of Lord 31anesburgh&apos;s Committee has been received.(Sgd.)
