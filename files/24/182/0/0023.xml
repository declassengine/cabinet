POOR PAW PJJPORMAKD BLOCS GRANTSv MEMORAHSUM BY THE PRESIDENT OS&apos; THE BOARD OP&quot;IMMH ..........It will be for the convenience of the Cabinet if I set out my views on the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;-&apos;s Memorandum j. CP. 395 (26).It is important in this matter to keep three questions distinct :-(1) Should Block Grants for education and perhaps other services be put In force concurrently with Block Grants in respect of health and. assigned revenues ? (2) Should legislation for this object be introduced concurrently with the legislation necessary to establish Block Grants In respect of health services and assigned revenues? (3) Should the Block Grants for all these Services beconsolidated In a single Block Grant? My answer to (1) is &quot;Yes, if possible&quot;, but my answer to (2) is emphatically &quot;Ho&quot;, &quot;because it is now too late. The Minister of Health has been proceeding on the only lines on which it is possible to make a change from Percentage to Block Grants, iae., he has been negotiating with local Authorities and when he introduces legislation, each Authority will, I understand, be able to form a fairly close estimate of the amount of the grant which it will get under the new system. In other words, It will not be asked to buy a pig in a poke, and Parliament, in depriving Authorities of the percentage grant will know what it is giving them in exchange. -      The Local Education Authorities are hot in that position andOR B go COPY HOo $
cannot now possibly be in that position by next spring, I have been unable to negotiate with thorn as yet and the necessary negotiations will be long and difficult.      I have already explained to the Cabinet that I am doubtful whether a satisfactory block grant can, at this stage, he devised for teachers1 salaries and the Chancellor seems to me to dismiss too lightly the difficulties to which I have drawn attention and which are recognised In the report of the Treasury Committee.      I do not wish to prejudge these issues at this moment, but to make poor lav; Reform next year dependent upon such difficult negotiations the ground for which has not yet even been explored would, I am afraid, wreck the prospects of that reform, at any rate for the time being.As to question (3), I should personally very much welcome a unified Block Grant system, hut it seems fairly certain that, in view of the strong differences whioh at present exist between the Departments on this subject, we shall not be able to work out such a system satisfactorily before next spring, and we shall in fact probably find it necessary to postpone unification until    &quot;Service&quot;    Block Grants have been separately established during an experimental period.      The Minister of Healthxg proposals already provide for such an experimental period, i.o. , a period of three years during which the distribution of grants according to standards of population and rateable value will be modified by a guarantee to each Authority of a minimum grant based on its average grants for a previous period of three years.       I doubt whether this particular form of experimental transition froi.. a percentage to a Block Grant will he found to be applicable to education services.      For Instance, if applied to education services, it would maintain the grants paid to the London County Council at what I regard as an unreasonably -high level.    &apos; But if wo are to have a period of experimental
transition at all, is it necessary that during this period every &quot;Service&quot; Grant should be assessed on the  same lines? Is there any reason wiry the Block Grant for the first three years for education services should not be frankly an &quot;assessed grant&quot; based upon the estimates of Local Authorities&apos; needs for the next three years, which I now have before me?      Such an &quot;assessed grant&apos;1 would, in. all probability, be substantially loss expensive to the Exchequer than a grant following the lines of the Minister of Health&apos;s proposals.      It Is only,  I believe, after both the Local Authorities and the Government have had experience of the working of Block Grants during this experimental period that we shall be able to arrive at a unified Block Grant system^My own Inclination, therefore, would be to work to the following programme : -(1) Legislation next year for Poor Law Reform andfor the establishment of Block Grants for health services and assigned revenuesi(2) Legislation in 1923 repealing the &quot;fifty per centminimum&quot;  provisions of the Education Act.(3) Block Grants for health and assigned revenuesand,  so far as possible, for education to be brought Into operation for an experimental period of three years beginning, say, from the year 1929-3CU(4) Establishment of a unified Block Grant system.,  iffound practicable, for a period of 5 or 7 years beginning from the year 1932-33. On the immediate question I feel it is essential thatthe Cabinet should authorise the Minister of Health to go forward with his scheme.      So far as political considerationsarc concerned we shall gain all that the Chancellor has
In mind   if . we treat the Minister of Health&apos;s Bill next year as an instalment of a groat financial reform and we should avoid prejudicing it by a premature attempt to deal at the same moment with a question on which political passion is so easily aroused as the Government&apos;s education policy.,(ltd.)     E.r.Board of Education, 23rd November,  1926.
