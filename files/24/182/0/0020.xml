COPY NO o  m*aSECRET- -------- --C oPc395.CABINET -&apos;   POOR. LAW REFORM AND BLOCK GRANTS * Memorandum by the^Chancellor of the BxchequerIn connection with-his scheme of Poor Law Reform theMinister of Health proposes a revision of the grants now paidto Poor Law and other authorities under the Assigned RevenueSystem and those voted annually by Parliament for public healthpurposes and their replacement by block grants fixed for a termjjjaa C.P.    of years on a basis independent of expand.iture o x $9(26).With   the main objects of this reform as set out inparagraph 19 of the Minister&apos;s memorandum I am in entire agreement It has become increasingly obvious in recent years that a radical change In the system of percentage grants is urgently called for. The present system necessarily involves a degree of interference from Whitehall in the details of local government which saps local initiative, weakens the local sense of responsibility and the forces making for economical administration, involves, unnecessary expenditure on admin ist rat ion both national and local and ties the hands of the Chancellor of the Exchequer as regards a large and rapidly growing part of the national expenditure.The policy of replacing this system by one of block grants Independent of expenditure ha3 been accepted by the Government -and announced at various times by the Prime Minister, tho Minister of Health,&apos; the President of the Board of Education and myself in Parliament and the method to be followed in carrying that policy into effect has been under consideration by an Inter-departmental Committee/(THIS DOCUMEKT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAiiNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT ).
under the Chairmanship of Sir George Bars tow.    In an interim report recently before the Cabinet (CP. 282 (26)  ) that Committee indicated in broad outline the problem to be faced and the two main y^ays of dealing with it.    They pointed out that the new system of block grants could be worked out either with four &quot;Service Grants&quot;, one for each of the four main services,  education,  roads, public health and police, or the whole Exchequer aid to local authorities might be com-bined together in a &quot;General Grant&quot; given in respect of these services as a whole.    In either case the departments concerned in the supervision of these services, while dispensing with much of their present detailed control would each retain their general control over the efficient adminis-tration of the service in each local government area relying on the ultimate sanction of a reduction of the grant:    in the former case,  the Service Grant and in the latter,  the General Grant.The question which of these two systems should be adopted depends very largely on such practical considerations as the possibility of devising a satisfactory basis for the calculation of the grant and of surmounting the administrative obstacles arising from the present distribution of authorities. Judging by the difficulties experienced by the Committee in devising an interim scheme of block grants for education, the proposed General Grant would appear to present the most hopeful line of approach and the Cabinet recently decided that the Committee should proceed to formulate a scheme on this basis.It is with reference to this stage in the development of our policjr of block grants that the financial part of the
proposals of the Minister of Health falls to be considered, I see no inherent difficulty in associating the administrative part of the scheme of Poor law Reform either with a &quot;Service&apos;1 block grant, such as he suggests, or a &quot;General&quot; block grant.   What is of vital importance is that the Cabinet should envisage the grant problem as a whole and ensure that the successful completion of this far reaching financial reform is not projudiced by interim decisions related to a comparatively small part of the whole field of Government subventions to local Authorities,,The practical question. now before us therefore is whether the limited financial proposals in the Minister1s memorandum should, subject to any modifications which further departmental examination may suggest, be proceeded with first; being merged subsequently in the major scheme: or whether the major scheme should be carried into effect con-currently with the reform of the Poor law,,I am convinced that the second course is the right one to follow and for these reasons,   Pirst, it is of the utmost importance both politically and financially that all the changes contemplated in the grant system should be made together and that they should synchronise as far as possible with the administrative reform of the poor law system and the introduction of the new valuation lists0    In this way the financial effect on the ratepayer of the various changes in the grant system will be obscured and the net disturbance in local rates will in many cases be less than would be involved by introducing separate grant schemes for each service sue cessivel:/, inasmuch as reductions of grant
on account of one service will often tend to be effect by increases on account of another.    The result will be that less new money will be required from the Exchequer to float the complete scheme than a succession of separate schemes.Secondly, tho major scheme can be presented as a financial and administrative reform of the first magnitude -indeed it will be the greatest step towards the development of responsible local Government since Goschen introduced his scheme of assigned revenues for the newly created County Councils of 1888n    Such schemes develop a momentum that carries them over opposition that would wreck proposals more narrowly drawn,Thirdly,  it is very desirable that the new scheme of grants should be put into operation as regards education before the Burnham scales for teachers come up for revision towards the end of 1930-1.    A guarantee to local authorities against any reduction of their existing grants would be sufficient to prevent any of them from breaking away from the award during the last year or so of its currency on the ground that the grant system was being altered to their detriment.    If, on the other hand, the revision of the education grants were left until the end of the award period the matter would undoubtedly be made a political issue by the teachers and the local authorities might again use the revision Vf &quot;the award as a lever to prevent any changes in the grant system,Fourthly, the present proposals of the Minister of Health devote to the limited field of health grants (in addition to new money estimated at  1-g- million a year) the large free balances on the Assigned Revenues System now going in relief of rates which have no relation whatever to
poor law or health expenditure.    Historically they miglxt^ ^ be claimed to be given In respect of road expenditure, cut they would most properly be used to float a complete scheme of new grants.Fifthly, a.lthough the Minister of Health&apos;s scheme purports to dea.1 only with Health and Poor Law finance, the Exchequer subventions are in fact so inter-related that actually it entails considerable alterations in other grants and services.    Thus(a) a wholly new basis of distribution is proposed for the large grants under the Agricultural Rates Acts  and the Tithe Rent Charge Acts:(b) the money nor? being paid for Higher   education and Police purposes from the Local Taxation Accouxit would    In future have to be voted:(c) the  distribution of the duties of the boards of Guardians involves pla.influencing on the local Education authorities functions as regards children in Poor Lav/ Schools which would involve additions to the Education Vote estimated by the Minister of Health at from half a million to a million a year.    (This is in addition, to the 1-g million new money). In urging my colleagues to agree to the whole grant question being dealt with at one and the same time,   I see no reason to think that this need delay or in any way Impede the reform of poor law administration. The necessary data for the formulation of a complete scheme  of block grants are readily available and I am advised that there should be no difficulty in submitting proposals to the  Cabinet in time to be embodied in legislation next Session.    So far from the&apos;financial
poor law or health expenditure.    Historically they might be claimed to be given In respect of road expenditure, but tney Would most properly be used to float a complete scheme of new grants.Fifthly, although the Minister of Health &apos;s scheme purports to deal only with Health and Poor Law finance, the Exchequer subventions are in fact so inter-related that actually it entails considerable alterations in other grants and services.    Thus(a) a wholly new basis of distribution is proposed for the large grants under the Agricultural Rates Acts and the Tithe Rent Charge Acts:(b) the money now being paid for Higher   education and Police purposes from the Local Taxation Account would    in future have to be voted:(c) the  distribution of the duties of the boards of Guardians involves placing on the local Education authorities functions as regards children in Poor Law Schools which would involve additions to the Education Vote estimated by the Minister of Health at from half a million to a million a year.    (This is in addition to the If million new money). In urging my  colleagues to agree to the whole grant question being dealt with at one and the same time,  I see no reason to think that this need delay or In any way Impede the reform of poor law administration. The necessary data for the formulation of a complete scheme  of block grants are readily available and  I am advised that there  should be no difficulty in submitting proposals to the Cabinet in time to be embodied in legislation next Session.    So far from the financial
scheme hindering the progress of the administrative measure? I believe that to proceed simultaneously with two first class measures of this kind would tend to divide and confuse any opposition to the Government1 s proposals, without adding seriously to the volume of Parliamentary business *\( 0 s * c   9
