IN CHINA.:(No19 by the Secretsry *)I am instructed by the Prime Minister to circulate the attached Statement of Policy; prepared for tho use of Mr Lamps on., the British Minister-designate at Pekin, which was approved by the&apos;) Cabinet Committee on China this evening for submission to the Cabinet *The procedure which it is proposed that Mr Lamps on should adopt on receipt of this Statement will be explained verbally by the Foreign Secretary at the Meeting of the Cabinet.(Signed) M.P.AwHANKBYj Secretary, Cabinet.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,
Draft instructions to I.Ir. Lampscn.2Por some time past Bis luajes ty 1 s Government have watched with growing anxiety the situation in China and they &quot;believe that this anxiety will be shared by the Governments of the interested powers.      five years ago the Powers assembled at Washington and, taking into c onsiderationa the circumstances then existing in China, they agreed among themselves in conjunction with the representatives of the Chinese Government that their future policy should be guided by certain general principles designed to safeg-&apos;ta:.:d the integrity and independence of China, to promote her political and economic development and the rehabilitation of her finances. It was agreedto grant her certain increases on her treaty tariff in order to provide the revenue required for these purposes.      It was further agreed that a Commission should examine the question of extraterritoriality with a view to amending the system now in force by the elimination of abuses and accretions and by the removal of unneces-sary limitation on China&apos;s sovereignty.(2)     Unfortunately the Tariff Conference did not meet for four years and during that period the situation had greatly deteriorated.      During a succession of civil&apos; wars the authority of the Peking Government had diminished almost to vanishing point while in the south a powerful nationalist government at Canton definitely disputed thv&amp;. right of the Government at Peking to speak on behalf of China or enter into binding engagements in hernameo      This process of disintegration, civil war and waning ceugral authority continued with  increased accelerationafter/
after the Tariff Conference had met until eventually the Conference   iiegotiat ions came  o an end because there was no longer a Government with whom to negotiate *(3)      The Commission on extraterritoriality has meanwhile completed its labours and presented its report, but here again we are faced with  a similar difficulty due to the disintegration of China.    The recommendations contained in the Report while suggest-ing certain reforms capable of being carried into immediate effect presuppose for their full execution the existence of a Government possessing authority to Gatea&apos; into engagements on behalf of the whole of China3(4)     During all these civil wars it has been the consistent policy of Els Majestyls Government to abstain from any interference between the warring factions or rival governments.     Despite the disorders which  civil war engenders and the grevious losses in-flicted on the vast commercial interests, both Chinese and foreign, His Majesty7s Government have declined to associate themselves with  any particular faction or to interfere in anyway in the civil commotionso   His Majesty*s Government believe that the Dowers have adopted a similar attitude and that  this is and will continue to be the only right attitude to maintain.(5)      The situation which exists in China today is thus entirely different from that which faced the ^oxters at the time they framed the Washington Treaties.    In the present state of confusion^ though some progress has been made by means of local negotiation and agreements with regional Governments; it has not been possible for the Dowers to proceedwith /
with the programme of Treaty revision which was foreshadowed at Washington or to arrive at a settlement of any of the out-standing questions relating to the position of foreigners in China,     The political disintegration&apos; in China has, however, been accompanied by the growth of a powerful nationalist movement which aimed at gaining for China an equal place among the nations and any failure to meet this movement with sympathy and understanding would not respond to the real intentions of the Powers towards China.6.     His MajestyTs Government after carefully reviewing the position desire to submit their considered opinion as to the coursJ which the Washington Treaty Powers should now adopt.     His Majestyls Government propose that these governments shall issue a statement setting forth the essential facts of the situation;    declaring their readiness to negotiate on treaty revision and. all other outstanding questions as soon as the Chinese themselves have constituted a govem-ment with authority to negotiate;    and stating their intentions pending the establishment of such a government to pursue a constructive policy in harmony with the spirit of the Washington Conference but developed and adapted to meet the altered circumstances of the present time.7.     His Majesty&apos;s Government propose that in this joint declaration the Powers should make it clear that in their constructive policy they desire to go as far as possible towards meeting the legitimate aspirations of the Chinese nation.      They should abandon the idea that the economic and political development of China can only bo secured under foreign tutelage and should declare their readiness to recog-nize her right .to the enjoyment of Tariff autonomy as soon as she herself has settled and. promulgated a new national tariff. They should expressly disclaim any intention of forcing foreign control upon an unwilling China.      They should show that they are prepared to revise their traditional attitude- regarding
the upholding of strict treaty rights.      There will continue to he in the future as there have been in the past breaches of treaties as a result either of lawlessness or of deliberate intent, hut it will be equally difficult to secure the enforcement of treaty stipulations or to effect their much needed revision.      During this possibly very prolonged period of uncertainty the Powers can only, in the view of Eis Iiajestyrs Government, adopt an expectant attitude and endeavour to shape developments so far as possible in conformity with the realities of the situation so that&apos; ultimately, when treaty revision becomes possible, it will be found that part at least of the revision has already been effected on satis-factory lines.      It would therefore he wise to abandon the policy of ineffective protest over minor matters, reserving protest - which should then be made-effective by united action - only for cases where vital interests are at stake.     Every case should be considered on its merits and the declaration should show that the Powers are prepared to consider in a sympathetic spirit any reasonable proposals that the Chinese authorities, wherever situated, may make even if contrary to strict interpretation of treaty rigjhts, in return for fair and considerate treatment of foreign interests by them,     The declaration should show that it is the policy of the Powers to endeavour to maintain harmonious relations with China without waiting for or insisting on the prior establishment of a strong Central government.
(0)    It is the earnest hope of His Majesty1 s   Government that the powers will agree to adopt the principles of the policy outlined above and apply them to tho realities of the ore sent situation.      Certain recommendations in the Reports of the Commission on Extraterritoriality ioforred in paragraph 3 above and certain other reforms not covered by that Commissions Report but falling under tho general heading of Extraterritoriality can be carried into effect even in present conditions without great delay.    There is, however, one step of moro immediate importance which,  in tho opinion of His Majesty1s Government tho Powers should agree to take at once.    His ;.lajestyrs Government believe that an endeavour should be made to undo the evil results which have flowed from the failure of the Tariff Conference to implement the promises as to tariff increases made by tho Powers to Chin nearly five years agoy. ahd they propose therefore that the Powers should agree to tho irnnediato unconditional grant of the Washington surtaxes.(9)    By the China Customs Treaty signed at Washington on the 6th of February,  19S2, the Powers promised to grant China certain tariff increasos (commonly known as the hashing t surtaxes) &quot;for such purposes and subject to &quot;such conditions&quot; as the Special Conference might determine.    That special conference is the Tariff Conference which, after a delay of nearly four years, met in Poking on the 26th October,  1925 and has now to all intonts and purposes definitely failed. The promised surtaxes have not been granted..     The Foreign Delegations were not satisfied with the assurances which the Chinese Delegation offered at the session of the 18th ilarch as t o the purposes to which the Chinese government would themselves devote tho proceeds of the surtaxes.They. .
They wore prepared to grant them only upon conditions which ensured that the proceeds would he placed under foreign control and applied - in groat Dart - to the liquidation of the unsecured debt.(10)    Proc the very outset His ,;ajestyrs Government were opposed to the question of the unsecured debt being dealt with by the Tariff Conference at all ana thoy frankly expressed this view in a confidential memorandum communicated to the Consortium Powers early in 1923. They foresaw that it might defeat the intentions of tho Uashington Conference, which were to assist the economic and political development of China and to relax - not to tighten - foreign control.        They held that,  the object of the concessions proposed at the v/ashington Conference being to benefit China,  the principal purposes to whioh the Customs surtax should be devoted ought to be productive objects such as railway construction, and social, or economic reforms which would be a permanent benefit to China as a whole.      The most promising of these reforms was in their opinion the abolition of likin, which moreover was expressly contemplated in the Treaty itself.(11)    It has boen argued that debt c onsol*dt:ation would also be a permanent benefit to China because it would restore China&quot;s oredit.      This argument would doubt-less be valid if there were a government in effeotive control of the whole country,  but in China to-uay debt consolidation oould only enable the faction which happened to be in power in Poking to resort to fresh ruinous and unproductive borrowing.His
Hie ;viaj e s ty&apos; s Government were therefore opposed to making the consolidation of the unsecured debt one of the purposes to be attained by the Tariff Conference although their own nationals  &quot;ere directly interested in the funding of some of these debts.12.      A further objection to the inclusion of the unse-cured debt among the subjects to be dealt with at the Tariff Conference was brought into relief by the grant in principle of Tariff autonomy..     That raised at once in acute form the question of control over Customs revenues.      His Majesty&apos;s Government viewed with grave misgiving the proposal that foreign control, should be extended over additional revenues which might be enormously increased by tariff autonomy.      In 1921 it was natural that the powers should demand guarantees for the due fulfilment of the benevolent purposes which the Washington Conference aimed at achleving.      But what might have been practicable in 1921 was&apos; no longer possible in 1926. It was obvious that China would not now submit to any ex-tension of foreign control, either for debt consolidation or for the abolition of likin, and it seemed to His Majestyrs Government that for the Powers to unite in an attempt to impose control upon an unwilling China would be entirely opposed to the spirit of tne Washington treaties, and to the policy which His Majesty&apos;s Government had consistently advocates-eated.     At the same time His !:,a jesty f&apos;s Government felt that it was essential that the Washington promises, so long over-due,  should be implemented.      Accordingly on the 28th May last in reply to an enquiry  from the United States government as to the attitude of His /iajesty rs Government towards the Tariff Conference,  they proposed in a memorandum, copy of which is annexed hereto,  that the Powers should abstain from any attempt to exact guarantees or conditions,  but should forthwith authorise the levy of the surtaxes.k   Not yet available.
s I13o    Owing to the collapse of the conference no action on this proposal was possible..      The situa-tion, however,  suddenly developed in the very direc-tion which was anticipated when the proposal was made. The Cantonese did in fact seize the Washington sur-taxes by levying,  in defiance of the Treaties,  cer-tain additional taxes on the foreign trade of the Port. His Majesty&apos;s Government have with much reluctance joined in the protest against the new&quot; taxes for the sake of maintaining solidarity with the Powers,, but they are not satisfied that this is the right policy for the present situation,,      They regret that they did not more insistently press their views at an earlier stage of the Conference, but they think that it isstill *not too late, despite the protest already made, to return to the alternative course proposed in the memorandum of May 28th. His mjestyrs Government therefore strongly urge that the Powers should now authorise the immediate levy of the Washington sur-taxes unconditionally throughout China, They hope that this may provide a basis for regularising the position at Canton.14.      The principal objection that will probably be made to this proposal is that in strict logic it would amount to condoning a breach of treaty.      This argument, however, does not sufficiently take into account the realities of the situation.   -  The basic facts of the present situation are that the treaties are now admittedly in many respects out of date,, and that in any attempt to secure revision the Chinese are
confronted on the one hand with the internal difficulty of their own disunion and on the other with the external difficulty of obtaining the unanimous   con-currence of the Powers.      The latest instance of this is the failure of the attempt to alter the tariff of 1858.      Mere protests against each and every breach of treaty rights must, therefore, necessarily be in-effective.      His Majesty&apos;s Government attach the greatest importance to  the sanctity of treaties but they believe that this  principle may best be maintained by a sympathetic adjustment of treaty rights to the equitable claims of the Chinese.      Protests should be reserved for cases where there is an attempt at whole-sale repudia tion of treaty obligations or an attack upon the legitimate and vital interests of foreigners in China, and in these cases the protests should be made effective by the united action of the Powers.15,      His Majesty&apos;s Government have consistently carried out the obligation of full and frank consulta-tion imposed on all the Powers alike by Article VII of the Nine Powers Pact,   and it has been their constant aim - sometimes even when this involved a sacrifice of their own opinion - to maintain the solidarity of the Powers.      It is in pursuance of this aim that His Majestyrs Government are now communicating to the Powers this statement of the principles by which they believe that policy should be guided&apos; in future.      They feel assured that the Powers will share the anxiety of His Majesty&apos;s Government to act towards China in the spirit which inspired the Washington Treaties, and it is their earnest hope that the Powers will agree that
that spirit cannot better be fulfilled than by adopting the policy which is now presented for their consideration,16.      It seems to His Majesty^ Government that the first step towards the carrying of this new policy into effect should be the immediate uncon-ditional grant of the Washington surtaxes.      Lest it be supposed that the grant of the surtaxes might favour one faction at the expense of the others, and so provid.e a further incentive to civil war, His Ma j e e tyf s Government deem it important to point out that, as no conditions would be attached to the grant, the proceeds of the surtaxes ?Jould not necessarily be remitted by the Commissioners of Cue toms to the Gus-todian banks at Shanghai,      It would in each case be for the competent Chinese authorities to decide all questions as to the disposition and banking of these additional revenues.      His Majestyrs Government would be glad, to learn at the earliest possible moment whether the Powers agree to the unconditional grant of the Washington surtaxes.
