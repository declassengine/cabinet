COMMITTEE OH R AIL&quot; 7AY ^ T RUS T BE SECURITIES . report.1- In pursuance of Cabinet 62(26) Conclusion 1, theCommittee have examined the proposal of tho Railway Association that  in view of the exceptional circumstances of 1926 special legislation should be passed to suspend, in respect of that year, the requirement of Section l(i)fg) of the Trustee Act of 1925 that a dividend on the rate of not less than 3 per oent per annum must be paid on the prdinary stock of the Railway Company in order that the Company7s prior securities may preserve their trustee security status. The case for the Railway Companies is stated in the documents attached to the Minister of Transports Memorandum rotos-f26)l appended to this ReportsAfter careful consideration the Committee are unanimously of opinion that the consequence of any legislative interference with the conditions of railway securities would be far more prejudicial than any results likely to arise from the default of individual Railway Companies..      This view, which has the author at it ive support of the Governor of the Bank of England and other high  financial opinion,  is based on considerations such as the followingo3. -It is of supreme importance that the high standard andrepute of the British Trustee stock list should be maintained unimpaired and that no action should be taken which might-1.
? re as u. ry &apos; Ch amb e rs 13th December, 1925.have the effect in any way of diminishing public confideBce in the stocks on the list,  or of misleading investors as to the character of the security.      The legislation proposed would no doubt temporarily relieve those Companies whose financial position has been most adversely affected by the recent crisis.    It would, however, have far more serious and permanent reactions on the prior securities of other Railway Companies and on Trustee stocks generally-. It is most desirable that the Railway undertakings should be placed as soon as possible on a proper economic basis. This will only be accomplished when the serious financial condition of the Companies Is fully realised by all interested pc rti es.4. The lord Chancellor, who was unable to attend theLleeting of the Committee,  Is understood to concur in the foil owlng re c ommendation.5, The Committee recommend to the Cabinet that theMinister of Transport should be authorised to inform the Railway Association that the Government are not prepared to entertain the proposal that Parliament should be invited to suspend in respect of 19 6 the operation of Section l(i)(g) of the Trustee Act 1925.(Signed on behalf of the Committee) WINSTON S.

S-E G R B T xt.T.S.   f&apos;26)  1.0 A  1 HE I.Copy Eo.COMMITTEE Oil RAILWAY EBUS3TE3 SECURITIES.RAILWAY TRUSTEE STOCKS.Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.ICirculate herewith the follow!ng :-Copy of letter of 8th Pec ember,  1926 from the Railway Companies&apos; Association.Copy of a memorandum by the Association accompanying that letter.Draft Bill submitted by the Association.I have not beon legally advised upon tho exact position in regard to Railway Stocks as Trustee Investments or upon special points which may arise in regard to the stocks of particular Companies under the terms of their Amalgamation Orders or otherwise.Broadly, however,  the position appears to be as follows :-In England, under the Trustee Act 1925,  Section 1 (l) g the prior charge stocks of Railway Companies are eligible as   -trustee investments provided that not less than Zffo has been paid on the ordinary stock for each,of the ten previous years,    For this purpose,  each of the Amalgamated Railway Companies is deemed to have paid 2ffo in each of the ten years immediately before the date of amalgamation.In scotland,  debenture stocks are eligible without qualifica-tion and other prior obarges,  provided the dividend is not oontin-gent on the profits of the year,  if &quot;a dividend&quot; has been paid on the Ordinary Stock for the ten previous years.      If the dividend * is contingent on the years profits, then the rate of dividend on the ordinary stook must have boen not less than
In both countries,  (sea Section 1 (i)  (v) of vh% Trustees Act 1925 for England) securities approved by the court rank as trustee securities and the supreme Court has ruled (Order XKII Rule 17) that funds under the control af or subject te the order of the Court may h*e investeS in tho prior charges of railway companies, which have paid &quot;a dividend&quot; on their ordinary sttsok for tho ten previous&apos;years.It would not therefore appear th&amp;$ Railway Stocks would cease to be Trustee Stocks so long as the Company consemsil paid any dividend on its ordinary stook.      Eor the purpose of the Trustee Act and the rtules preferred Ordinary and deferred ordinary stocks are taken together and the total amount paid in dividend is distributed rateably over the whole stock in order to ascertain the rsio of dividend paid..      Three of the Amalgamated Companies have already distributed interim dividends on their ordinary stock.A deputation from the Railway Companies&apos; Association has represented to roe that at least one of the Amalgamated Companies will be unable to pay 5$ on its ordinary stock.The Association took the view tha*t the Railway Companies would be left in an unsatisfactory position if their stocks no   -longer retained their full status as Trustee Stocks under the Trustee Act and their memorandum is directed to this^peint.    They urged that the effectual means of giving relief to any railvsay companies the full trustee status of whose stocks under the Trustee Act is endangered would he to enact by Statute that it shall be deemed to have paid a dividend of Zfa on its ordinary stock in 192^ even if it declares less than that rate or no dividend at all.    They have submitted a single-clause Bill drafted on these lines and  also the accompanying memorandum which sets out their difficulties both legal and: financial.
Tho questions for consideration would appear to he(l)    How far the Companies Stocks are protected by the Rules of Court.(2)    Whether those joules could be modified and if so on what lines and under what procedure.(3)    Whether to amend the Trustee Act as suggested. From the point of view of transport and the general public interest involved in cheap transport,  it is obvious that loss of trustee status will make boi^rcwing for development dearer and so either restrict development or increase the cost of freight and travel,    Failure of one railway company to maintain the trustee status of its stocks would probably react unfavourably on the ability of all railway companies to borrow cheaply.    On these grounds intervention by tho legislature may perhaps be justified, if no satisfactory alternative presents itself.The great reduction in the Railway Companies liquid assets will make it more difficult for them to finance capital develop-ments temporarily out of their internal resources, as has been largely their practice in the past, and the fact that,  apart from the Coal Strike, they have recently been unable to earn at the level of their Standard Revenue has already militated against their ability to borrow on favourable terms.    In view of the need for electrification, modernisation of Dock equipment and other improvement in or additions to facilities,  it is very desirable that it should be possible to raise new capital without unduly increasing the burden of transport charges-Attention is drawn to the request made in the Associations1s-letter that if the Government agree to special action an announce-ment of thiir intention should be made before Parliament rises.W.A.  -Ministry of Transport,December 9th,  1926.
LONDON&apos; AND NORTH EASTERN RAILWAY, 9 Marylebone Station,London, H.W..1. 8th December, 19&amp;6.Dear Sir,RAILWAY TRUSTEE STOCKS.Referring to the interview whioh the Deputation from the Railway Companies&apos; Association had with the Minister on this subject last Monday, I send you, as promisor!,    a Memorandum on tho points upon which the Minister desired to have information^The Association hope very much that it will be possible to obtain tho view of the Government upon the passing of legislation along the lines of the draft Bill which was left with the Minister on Monday, and that,  if the view be favourable to the passing of such a measure, action might be taken before la rliament rises, by means of question and answer in the House, to inform the House end the public of the attitude of the Government in regard to the proposal.It is appreciated that the time available before Parliament rises is very short, but it is felt that an early pronouncement on the subject would be of inostirable value.Yours faithfully,(Signed)    R.  FRANCIS DUNNEL.The Secretary, Ministry of Transport, 6,  Whitehall Gardens, So v?9-X*
(Memorandum accompanying Sir Frsncis Dunne111s letter to the Ministry &amp;f Transport dated 8th December,  1926).tRAILWAY_____CjOi-iFAWIfiSl__ASSOCIATION.RAILWAY   TRUSTEE    STOCKS. SCSMORAHDTJM.The effect which the Railway strike and the Coal Strike which originated last May has had upon the financial position of Railway Companies is deplorable,   and the gravity of that position can hardly be exaggerated,     At the close of the present year no Railway Company will have earned sufficient net receipts to pay any dividend on its ordinary stocks.      The London and North Eastern Company,  serving as it does large industrial districts in the rlarth East of England and Scotland and being very largely dependent for its revenue on the heavy trade,  such as coal,  steel and iron, has felt more acutely than any other Railway Company the enormous losses which have resulted from the Coal Strike.At the  close of the current year It is  estimated that the net income of the London and North Eastern Company (computed on the same basis as in 1925) will be  5,379,000 less than the net income available for the payment of interest arid dividends at the end of 1925,  at the e&quot;nd of which year the Company were even then compelled to withdraw the sum of  4,000,000 from the Railways Compensation-Account Reserve (Railways Act,  1921)  In order to pay a dividend of 5;v upon its Preferred Ordinary Stock and 1% upon  its Deferred Ordinary Stock,  these dividends in combination being onl^r slightly In excess  of the dividend at the rate of &apos;5% required to be paid under Section 1(1.) (g) of the Trustee Act,  1925,  In order to enable the Company to maintain the
availability of its pri^r stocks as Trustee investiments.      It will, therefore,  be seen that,  in order to maintain its Trustee position under the Section of the Act referred to, a sum of no less than  9,379,000 will be required to be f o\md.In addition to a sum of  346,880 brought forward from1925,  the Company have the following sums in. reserve  ir-Balance of Railways Compensation  .Account Reserve (railways act,   1921) 5,250,000Contingency Fund 1,244,041General Reserve 2,041,881but,  owing to the provisions of the proviso to Section 10(5) of the Amalgamation Scheme governing the London and North Eastern Company,       portion of the Contingency Fund or the General Reserve can be utilised for the payment of dividends.      It fallows,  therefore, that the total amount available will be  5,596,980, which falls short by  3,782,120 of the amount required to pa:/ dividends upon the Preferred and Deferred Stocks in respect of the year 1926 at a rate sufficient to maintain the Trustee position.As regards the Southern Railway Company,  the preservation&quot; of the Trustee position of their prior stocks would involve the withdrawal of practically the whole amount of the reserves of that companies?/ which are available for the payment of dividends. Similarly, the calls which the London Midland and Scottish Railway Company and the Great Western Railway Company would have to make upon their available reserves would be very heavy.The Railway Companies at the present time are experiencing great difficulty in raising capital,  and if they were to deplete their Reserve Funds to the extent indicated above, that difficulty would be accentuated.
It must be remembered that the Railway Companies have made large sacrifices in recent times in the national interest, They have made big reductions in railway rates in the hope that the reduction would assist in the revival of trade, a hope which has not been realised.Again,  in order to maintain even a restricted trainservice,  the Companies have been compelled to buy a largetonnage of foreign coal,  and the additional financial burdenthrown upon them by this cause is very great.      It is estimatedthat,  compared with the prices at which they were buying coalunder contract in the month of April last, the prices whichthey have had to pay for foreign coal will involve the companies in the following losses in respect of coal delivered by the endof the  current year  : -London and North Eastern Company - 2,CCD,000London Midland and Scottish Co. - 5,000,000Great Western Company   ----- - 1,000,000Southern Company         ------ - 530,000The Companies feel assured that the position thusindicated calls for sympathetic action on the part of theGovernment,  in support of their proposal that the Governmentshould secure the passing of a  short Bill which would have theeffect of suspending, in respect of the year 1926,  theprovision of Section 1(1)(g)  of the Trustee Act,  1925, which makes it obligatory that a dividend at the rate of not lessthan 3&apos;&apos;&apos; per annum should he paid on the ordinary stock of a railway Company in order that the debenture or rentcharge,   orguaranteed or preference,  stocks of that Company may beavailable as full Trustee stocks for the investiment of TrustFunds,  and it will be appreciated that failure in any one yearto pay   such a dividend on Ordinary Stocks by a Railway Companyinvolves the disappearance for ten years of the prior, stacksof that Company from the list cf full Trustee Securities.
Another- point which it is well to bring out is that the elimination of the prior stocks of any Railway Company from the Trustee list would undoubtedly result in a considerable selling by irustees of holdings in those stocks.      It is not a fact  that Trustees,  in such circumstances, are under any obligation to sell their holdings, but the view, though erroneous,  largely obtains that Trustees are compelled to do so and in any event there is no doubt that even well-informed Trustees might think it their duty to cnange the investment of Trust Funds.It is thought that action by the Government on the lines indicated in this Memorandum would receive unqualified support in high financial eircles and that there is a general desire that Railway Stocks, as Trustee investments,  should maintain the stability which has existed in the past. &quot;
BE it enacted by the King&apos;s most Excellent Majesty by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons in this present Parliament assembled and by the authority of the same,  as follows1, If by reason of the abnormal circumstances prevailing in the year 1926 any railway company shall fail to declare a dividend on its ordinary stock or shall declare a dividend which falls short of the rate of 3 per centum per annum upon that stock,  such company shall nevertheless for the purposes of the provisions of the. Trustee Act,  1925,  and -.f the Trusts (Scotland) Act,  1921,  relating to the  stocks and securities In which trustees are authorised to vest trust funds, be treated as if it had paid a dividend at a rate of not less than 3 per cent  on its ordinary stock for that year.2.
