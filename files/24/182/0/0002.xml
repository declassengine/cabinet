November 1926.SECRET.Copy No.    DC O.S. 53.Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.POSITION IN SOUTH-WEST ARABIA.(Previous C.O.S. Paper No. 51.)REPORT.BY direction of the Prime Minister we met on the 3rd November, 1926, to consider and report on the position in South-West Arabia. At this meeting we had the advantage of hearing the views of Major-General J. H. K. Stewart, the Resident and General Officer Commanding at Aden, who is at present on leave in this country, and of Sir Gilbert Clayton, who was in charge of the British Mission which visited the Imam of Sana in January 1926, but failed to negotiate an Agreement. In addition, Sir William Tyrrell and Mr. Oliphant attended on behalf of the Foreign Office, Sir John Shuckburgh on behalf of the Colonial Office, and Colonel Smith on behalf of the India Office.2. The present position in South-West Arabia is fully described in the Colonial Office Memorandum which is attached to this Report (Enclosure to Appendix). The specific questions on which our views have been invited are set forth in paragraph 10 of that Memorandum. Before recording our conclusions it appears desirable to indicate the general military considerations (using the term &quot; military &quot; in its broadest sense) by which we have been actuated.3. From the Naval point of view the security of Aden itself is vital. Aden is of great importance to the fuelling arrangements of the main Fleet when on passage to the Far East; it&apos;will be used as a Naval Anchorage and possesses repair facilities capable of dealing with destroyers. In addition, it is an alternative Convoy Assembly Point, a Port of Refuge for merchant shipping, and a Route Giving Unit. It has a powerful Wireless Station and a reserve of 108,000 tons of Naval oil fuel.4. It is of the first importance that foreign Powers should be prevented from establishing Naval bases, in addition to those which already exist, on either shore of the Red Sea. Kamaran Bay is the only anchorage in these waters which is capable of accommodating a large fleet, and which is not already in the possession of a foreign Power. It is intended that it should be used as a fuelling base and Convoy Assembly Point in the event of a war which necessitated arrangements of that nature in these parts. It is, therefore, imperative that no European Power should be permitted to establish itself on Kamaran Island.5. The Farsan Islands flank our communications through the Red Sea. In view of the fact that these communications are already flanked by the Italian ports in Eritrea, the Farsan Islands are of less importance than Kamaran. We cannot, therefore, say more than that it is very desirable from the Naval point of view that the present status of these islands should be maintained. We return to this question in dealing with Air considerations in paragraph 13.Naval Considerations.[15305]B
6. With regard to the possibility of exerting pressure on the Imam by means of Naval action, a blockade of his coast could be established without difficulty. We are, however, doubtful whether the effect of such a blockade upon the Imam would be appreciable, except in so far as his supply of munitions of war would be curtailed.Army Considerations.7. From the point of view of the Army it is necessary to occupy only such portions of the Aden Protectorate as are essential to the security of the Naval Base i.e., as far as tlie;end of the Railway, We consider that all commitments beyond this point are liable to be a source of military embarrassment rather than assistance.8.   The present garrison of Aden consists of One British Battalion. One Indian Battalion. The Aden Troop (Cavalry).9. According to available,information the forces which the Imam could dispose against us amount to 2,500 Regulars, together with Tribal Auxiliaries, whose numbers it is impossible to estimate.10. A detailed plan for the offensive action which would be required to clear the Protectorate of the Imam&apos;s occupation has been worked out by the local authorities. With this plan we are in general agreement. Its principal features may be summarised as follows :-(a.) The only practicable military objective is the occupation of Dhala (about 70 miles North of Aden). Operations beyond that point are impracticable owing to the nature of the country.(b.) The occupation of Dhala would not necessarily secure finality. To do this it would be necessary to remain in occupation.(c.) The force required for the operation is estimated at one Division Jess If Brigades of Field Artillery. It may be urged that the size of this force is out of all proportion of the opposition which it is likely to encounter, but it must be borne in mind, first, that there must be no risk of an initial setback, and secondly, that there would be a, long line of communication to be protected.(d.) Hostile opposition will probably be negligible, but. the difficulties occasioned by lack of water and sickness, especially the latter, are likely to be considerable.(e.) Owing to climatic conditions operations must be confined to the periodNovember to March. (/.) Owing to the, nature of the country only pack-transport could be employed.In this connection it is estimated that 7,900 camels would be required.11. The cost of operations on the above lines has not yet been worked out in detail, but the following rough estimate may be taken as a general guide. The transport of the force to and from India would cost about  1-^ million per trip. Its maintenance would cost about  250,000 per month. Taking into account the inevitable extras, such as Pension charges, &amp;c, it is thought that  6 million to  10 million would be a conservative estimate.12. We are of opinion that the existing garrison at Aden is not competent to prevent further encroachments by the Imam. If it were made more mobile, partial, but not complete, success in this direction might be expected.Air Force Considerations.13. Reference has already been made to the necessity, from the Naval point of view, of preventing any: foreign Powers from establishing themselves either in Kamaran or in a, lesser degree in the Farsan Islands. From the Air Force point of view this is equally important, except that, in this case, the objections to encroach&apos;-incnt apply to both Kamaran and the Farsan Islands with equal force. The establishment by&apos;a foreign Power of an Air base at either of these places would con-stitute a serious threat to our communications, and might lead to increased Air Force wmmifcment  in that part of the world.
3714. We are agreed that the Aden Protectorate could not be cleared by Air action alone.15. We believe that, although the bombing of the Imam&apos;s troops would probably yield insignificant results, the bombing of objectives,&apos;such as Taiz, where there is a Military Headquarters, would be likely to exert considerable influence on the Imam, and in this view we are supported by Sir Gilbert Clayton. In these cir-cumstances, we think that further encroachments might be prevented by the employment of a Squadron of Bombing Machines stationed at Aden. It is, however, necessary to emphasise that this Squadron could achieve its object only if its opera-tions were not confined to our side of the border, and if it had full authority to attack objectives situated within the territory of the Imam. It would therefore be imperative to warn the Imam in advance that any further encroachment would render his person, his followers, and his country liable to air attack.16. An essential corollary to the successful conduct of these operations is the protection of such advanced landing grounds as are necessary. For this duty we think that it might be advisable to raise local levies under the command of British Officers.17. In this connection we would point out that the employment of local levies would tend to strengthen the hands of the Administration in the direction suggested by Sir Gilbert Clayton in the following extract from a Memorandum which he submitted to the Colonial Office : * * * * * *&quot; Whatever the limit placed to the area of the Aden Protectorate, measures must be taken to increase the administrative and financial resources at the disposal of the Aden authorities to an extent which will enable them to exercise such a measure of control and direction over the tribes as will ensure the maintenance of law and order, and secure the defence of the frontier by promoting real cohesion and solidarity among tribes who are at present lawless, isolated and riddled with local dissension and intrigue.&quot;AL- -ii? 4k iV- -A&apos;- Ji.-^f -f? -A- -A&quot; &quot;7\- -Tf18. The cost of the employment at Aden of a Squadron of Bombing Machines has not yet been worked out in detail, and the sum which would be debitable on this account to the operations depends on the decision as to the incidence of cost. The full maintenance charges of a Bombing Squadron are  12,000 per month. To this would have to be added the cost of transport from England to Aden, and the cost of accommodation at Aden.19. We considered the possibility of bombing Sana from an aerodrome established at Kamaran, but we were informed by the representatives of the Foreign Office that this would create international complications, owing to Dutch interests in the Island. These objections would not, however, apply to air action against Sana from an aircraft carrier, provided that the carrier kept outside territorial limits. We were advised on the one hand, that the bombing of his capital would have considerable effect on the Imam himself though it might stiffen the attitude of his followers and on the other, that such action would have no appreciably adverse effect on the Moslem world in general. We therefore consider that the possibilities of this suggestion should be borne in mind.20. We would add that, if air action on the lines indicated in the preceding paragraphs is undertaken, the possibility of an attack on Aden by the Imam, and the consequent necessity of strengthening the garrison at that place must not be overlooked.Conclusions.21. In the light of the foregoing considerations our conclusions with regard to the specific questions referred to us are set forth seriatim: .(1.) Question 1. How far is it practicable or desirable to take offensive action against the Imam with a view to clearing the Aden Protectorate ? And what would be the probable cost in effort, blood and treasure of such action ?We are of opinion that the Aden Protectorate could not be cleared either by air action or by a combined operation, except at a cost which would not be commen-commensurate with the results attained (paragraphs 10, 11 and 14, ante).[15305] B 2   &apos;-&quot;
(2.) Question 2. // offensive action is ruled out, what action, if any, is required to maintain the status quo in the Protectorate ?With regard to political action, it is not within our province to express an opinion. With regard to military action, we consider that further encroachments might be prevented by the employment of a Squadron of Bombing Machines stationed at Aden. We desire to emphasise, however, that this squadron could not be expected to attain this object unless two conditions are observed. In the first place, it is essential that the Air Force should be authorised to operate beyond the frontier against objectives situated in the territory of the Imam. The Imam should, there-fore, be. definitely warned in advance that any encroachments on his part would automatically render his person, his followers and his country liable to air attack. In the second place, it is essential that the protection of such advanced landing-grounds as are necessary should be assured. We consider that this might be done by means of local levies under the command of British Officers (paragraphs 15 to 18, ante).In addition, we consider that the possibilities of air operations against Sana from an aircraft carrier should be further investigated, from the political, as well as from the naval, and air standpoints (paragraph 19 ante).We desire to add that, should offensive action on the lines indicated be decided upon, the possibility of an attack on Aden itself by the Imam, and the consequent necessity of increasing the garrison at that place must be borne in mind (paragraph 20, ante).(3.) Question 3. How far is it necessary in British interests to deny a foothold, even if it only takes the outward form of commercial penetration on the Arabian shores of the Red Sea, to a foreign Power? And what action is it desirable or practicable to take with this object?We consider it of vital importance that no European Power should be permitted to gain a foothold on the Arabian shores of the Red Sea, and more particularly on Kamaran or the Farsan Islands (paragraphs 4, 5 and 13, ante).With regard to the action which might be taken to achieve this object, we are not competent to advise.(4.) Question 4. Arising out of (3), is it desirable to support the Idrisi in his struggle against the Imam?   And, if so, what form should that support take?Although this question scarcely falls within our province, we would suggest that to support the Idrisi in any form would be a distinct breach of our guarantee of neutrality in the Imam-Idrisi conflict, and might involve us in military commit-in ents, which it is most desirable to avoid. We would add that, on general principles, we are averse to the issue of arms and ammunition to semi-civilised and uncivilised peoples under any conditions whatsoever.(5.) Question 5. The general situation?- With regard to this question we desire to record our opinion that, from the military point of view, it is necessary to occupy only such portions of the Aden Protectorate as are essential to the security of the Naval base, and that any additional -commitments are liable to be a source of military embarrassment (paragraph 7, ante).(Signed) BEATTY.GEO.

Extract from a Letter from the Colonial Office to the Secretary^Committee ofImperial Defence.C. 19336/26.Sir, Downing Street, October 22, 1926.I AM directed by Mr. Secretary Amery to transmit to you, to be laid before the Committee of Imperial Defence for their consideration, a copy of a memorandum on the position in South-West Arabia..... . - -Mr. Amery would be glad if the matter could be submitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence for consideration at as early a date as possible.I am, &amp;c.(Signed) J. E. SHUCKBTJRGH.Enclosure.Memorandum by Colonial Office.1. The three main problems which have arisen in South-West Arabia since the war are (1.) The occupation of parts of the Aden Protectorate by the Imam of the Yemen;(2.) The conflict between the Imam and the Idrisi on the eastern shores of the Red Sea; and(3.) The recent attempts of the Italians to extend their influence in this area.2. The Imam of the Yemen, also known as the Imam of Sana&apos;, and generally referred to simply as &quot; the Imam,&quot; is the head of the Zeidi sect of Islam, and, as such, a person of religious as well as temporal importance. The elimination of Turkish influence at the end of the War left him the chief power in South-West Arabia, and he began to encroach, not only upon the coastal plain of the Red Sea, but also upon the Aden Protectorate, which he claims to be part of his hereditary domains. The boundary of the Aden Protectorate was demarcated in 1905 by agreement with the Turkish Government; the Imam, however, declines to recognise this agreement. His Majesty&apos;s Government are bound by treaties, in some cases of many years&apos; standing, to protect the tribes within the Protectorate boundary. Protracted negotiations have failed to secure the recognition by the Imam of the frontier of 1905 and, in the meantime, he has occupied a considerable part of the Protectorate, including most of the inland mountain district north-east of Aden. We, on our part, have supplied the Protectorate tribes with arms and ammunition, and have on occasion co-operated with them from the air. But the general position is that, while the Imam&apos;s penetration may to some extent have been checked, it has not been defeated. . In January 1926 Sir Gilbert Clayton was sent to Sana&apos; to endeavour to negotiate a treaty with the Imam. Negotiations broke down on the question of evacuation by the Imam of the territory which he had occupied. It would appear that the Imam himself is anxious for British friendship, and would be prepared to make reasonable sacrifices to secure it; but he is surrounded by ignorant and bigoted advisers, who will allow no abatement in the dynastic claims which have for them a religious as well as a temporal significance.3. The situation was discussed at a Conference of the Departments concerned on the 5th August, at which both Sir Gilbert Clayton and Major-General Stewart, the present Resident at Aden, were present. The general conclusions reached by the Conference were (1.) That it would be useless to attempt to resume negotiations with-the Imam on the basis of his recognising the Protectorate boundary of 1905.(2.) That his ejection from the Protectorate would require a military campaign on a considerable scale.(3.) That the alternative of a naval blockade would give rise to numerous difficulties, and would be unlikely to prove effective.APPENDIX.
On the other hand, it was held that our Treaty obligations to the Protectorate tribes could not be ignored, and that some steps were required to strengthen the hands of the Resident at Aden against further encroachment by the Imam. For this purpose an increase in the R.A.F. establishment at Aden was recommended.4. The second ruler of importance in South-West Arabia is the Idrisi Saiyid of Asir. The founder of the dynasty was a Sudanese, who had settled on the Arabian Coast in 1829. He acquired much land and a reputation for sanctity, and his descendants gradually obtained the headship over the local tribes until, on the outbreak of war in 1914, the ruling Chief declared his independence of Turkey. He took the Allied side, and in 1915 undertook by treaty to attempt to drive the Turks from the Yemen, but to refrain from provocative action against the Imam. His Majesty 5s Government, on their part, undertook to protect his seaboard, to guarantee his independence and to endeavour to adjudicate between his claims and those of Imam, and to supply him with arms during the War. As a result of this support he succeeded in capturing&apos; the Farsan Islands from the Turks, and an agreement was made in 1917 whereby His Majesty&apos;s Government undertook&apos; to protect these islands and the Idrisi&apos;s seaboard from Foreign Powers, and to supply him with the sinews of war for this purpose. The Idrisi later occupied Loheiya, and, after the War was permitted to occupy Hodeidah on its evacuation by British troops. In 1923 he died. His son proved incompetent and was driven by the Imam first out of Hodeida and then out of the country to the North as far as Midi. He appealed to His Majesty&apos;s Government for assistance, but His Majesty&apos;s Government held that the treaty of 1915 was limited to the duration of the war and that the 1917 Agreement did not bind them to protect him against Arab rulers (as not being &quot;Foreign powers&apos; within the meaning of the Agreement). We accordingly refused to assist him either directly or with munitions. In 1925 he was replaced by his uncle, a stronger man, who has had some success in his resistance to the Imam, and believes that, if he can obtain munitions, he can regain the former Idrisi territories, or at any rate the greater part of them.5. His Majesty&apos;s Government, as stated above, have throughout the struggle between the Imam and the Idrisi maintained an attitude of neutrality. The Italians, however, have seen in this struggle an opportunity of obtaining a foothold in Arabia. They have assisted the Imam by supplying him with Avar material, including aeroplanes, guns, &amp;c. There have been reports that, as a result of this assistance and possibly of Italian instigation, the Imam contemplates an attack on the Farsan Islands. At the end of August the Italians concluded a treaty with the Imam, the provisions of which have been communicated by the Italian Government to His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Imam is referred to in this instrument as &quot; King of the Yemen,&quot; but no definition of the extent of his territory is given. The terms of the treaty deal almost entirely with commercial matters. The Italians will be given every opportunity of trading with the Yemen, will sell to the Imam whatever he may require (evidently war material.is indicated), and will assist him with the necessary personnel. The complete independence of the Yemen is explicitly recognised. It is further rumoured from Aden that the Italians have promised to protect the Imam&apos;s seaboard from attack, and have mounted guns at Salif. The motives of the Italians are not definitely known; they may be merely commercial; on the other hand there may be political or strategic considerations behind them. The occupation of Salif and the Farsan Islands by a foreign Power, would, in view of the Admiralty, constitute a grave menace to Imperial communications. Salif, it may be noted, was not part of the Idrisi&apos;s possessions in 1917 when the agreement was concluded between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Idrisi. No attack has yet been made on the Farsan Islands, where the Idrisi has recently granted an oil concession, subject to certain conditions, to a British Syndicate. It is possible that the Idrisi will obtain munitions from this Syndicate, which will enable him to resist any attack on the Islands. Until a few months ago we were bound by informal agreement with France, Italy and Belgium to prohibit the supply of arms, &amp;c, to Arabian rulers. In practice Italy observed the agreement very ill. We have now told the three other parties that we regard the embargo as withdrawn. The Syndicate mentioned above (and certain other British firms interested in this region) have been so informed, and in two cases permission has been given to obtain ammunition from the Resident at Aden, subject to replacement, for supply to the Idrisi. It seems probable, therefore, that the Idrisi will in fact obtain some of the ammunition that he needs.6. The clash of interests in Southern Arabia, which was developing between Great Britain and Italy, appeared to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to be
rlikely to damage relations between the two countries. He therefore caused to be handed to the Italian Ambassador on the 9th September, 1926, a memorandum setting forth the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the Imam-Idrisi conflict, and explaining the British interest in the Farsan Islands. A copy of this memo-randum,* which forms the first enclosure in Sir Austen Chamberlain&apos;s despatch No. 1257 of the 13th September to His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires at Rome, has been circulated as Enclosure 1 to C.I.D. Paper No. 720-B.7. The Governor of Eritrea, who negotiated the Italian treaty, is now in Rome, and Signor Mussolini informed Sir Austen Chamberlain at Leghorn that he proposed to invite the British Government to send a representative of the Foreign or Colonial Office to meet him in Rome to adjust our respective interests. A formal invitation in this sense has since been received from the Italian Government. Great care must be had for Italian susceptibilities, but Sir Austen Chamberlain is satisfied that Signor Mussolini desires a friendly settlement.8. It should be added that Ibn Saud, King of the Hejaz and Sultan of-Nejd, has offered to assist the Idrisi against the Imam, but the Idrisi has declined these offers as he feared that he might not be able to get rid of Ibn Saud afterwards.Two possibilities which should be taken into account are (a.) The partition of the Idrisi&apos;s territory between Ibn Saud and the Imam. (5.) The absorption of the Idrisi&apos;s territory by Ibn Saud, possibly in either caseAvith the relegation of the Idrisi to the position of Viceroy of Asir, underthe suzerainty of Ibn Saud.9.   An extract from the Aden News Letter for September is attached, f 10.  The views of the Committee of Imperial Defence are invited on the following-points : (1.) How far it is practicable or desirable to take offensive action against the Imam with a view to clearing the Aden Protectorate; and what would be the probable cost in effort, blood and treasure of such action;(2.) If offensive action is ruled out, what action, if any, is required to maintain the status quo in the Protectorate.(3.) How far it is necessary, in British interests, to deny a foothold, even if it only takes the outward form of commercial penetration, on the Arabian shores of the Red Sea to a foreign Power; and what action it is desirable or practicable to take with this object.(4.) Arising out of (3), whether it is desirable to support the Idrisi in his struggle against the Imam, and, if so, what form should that support take.(5.)
