(This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)CABINET.CRIST * _&apos;P. 428(26).--&quot; CLOSING HOURS FOR SHOPS.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.In March last I brought before the Cabinet the question of instituting an enquiry into the working of the present provisions of the law relating to the early closing of shops (see my memorandum of the 31st March, CP. 143 (26) ).      In that memorandum I suggested the appointment of a Select Committee. When the matter was considered at the Cabinet on the 14th April (Cabinet Oonolusions 15(26))  some doubt was expressed whether it was desirable to reopen the question and I was asked to discuss the matter with the Chief   Whip with a view to avoiding a Select Committee if possible.Throughout the whole of the year there has been a more or less continuous public agitation against the existing restrictions, particularly against the provisions which prevent the sale of cigarettes and   tobacco after closing hours not only in shops but also in restaurants and public houses.      There have been a number of Questions in Parliament, and adverse comments on the present restrictions have been common in newspapers and. periodicals of different shades of opinion, including some papers which might be expected to sympathise with the standpoint of the shop assistants.On the 29th November in reply to Questions &quot;by Sir Frank Meyer I said I had no information that there was anything like  ^ a majority feeling in the House in favour of a change, that although I had had a memorial signed by 110 Members that was the only indication I had received of the views of Members, and that if there was a consensus of opinion I would be willing to appoint a Committee to review the wholo question.As a result Sir Frank Meyer has presented mo with aJ
petition signed by 167 Members  (the Conservative members alonewere approached) who say they are in favour &quot;of the abolition of the war time restrictions on the sale of tobacco, sweets,ice cream, fresh fruit, etc.   In places of entertainment,restaurants, railway refreshment rooms, etc.  after shopclosing hours&quot;.I think it is very difficult to postpone an enquiryany longer.      It will be remembered that the Shops Act of1920 which continued the Order made under D.O.H.A. requiringshops to be closed not later than 8 p.m.  or on Saturdays9 p.m.  is a temporary Act which has been renewed each yearby the Expiring Laws Continuance Act.   - This Act cannot becontinued indefinitely by the Expiring Laws procedure, andit has always been understood that there would be at somesuitablo time a general review of the question with a viewto a permanent Act amending and consolidating the provisionsboth of the permanent Shops Act of 1912 and of the temporaryAct of 1920.I fully realise the strong feeling of many shop-keepers and of shop-assistants against any relaxation of the existing restrictions, but I feel that evon from the point of view of those who do sire thoir maintenance an enquiry ought not to be longer delayed,      As a result of the continuous criticism in the press and elsewhere, there is a wide impression amongst the public that the restrictions are merely war time survivals and the case for their maintenance is not understood. If the existing restrictions are to be maintained,    either with or without some modifications, an opportunity ought to be given to the Earljr Closing Association   and other bodies representing the shop-keepers and their assistants to argue their case before a tribunal whose opinion will carry weight with the general public.I propose therefore to set up at an early date a strong Departmental Committee which can be trusted to review the question in an impartial spirit, giving full weight both to the
public convenience and to the interests 01  shop-keepers and shop-assistants.      In view of the previous consideration of the matter by the Cabinet, I think it right to, let my colleagues know beforehand of this proposal.W.J.H.29th December,  1926.
