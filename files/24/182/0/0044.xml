The Indian Church Measure.I desire to inform my colleagues of the action that is being taken to give effect to what I believe to be the general wishes of the Anglican community in India as well as of the Church of England in this country in regard to the Indian Church Measure.Their nature is best explained by a brief reference to early history and to existing Parliamentary legislation which bears upon the subject.2. It is in continuation of the practice of the East India Company, dating back at least to the year of the Charter granted by William III to the East India Company in 169S, that the Secretary of State for India in Council to-day maintains an Anglican &quot; Ecclesiastical Establishment &quot; paid from Indian revenues, of which the sanctioned* There is an establishment of the strength (after recent reduction due to the Olmrch of;Scotland; of which the sanctioned smaller number of British troops in India, and strength is IS, hut this is in no way considerations of eoouomv) is 133.* These concerned in the present note. chaplains minister both to&quot;the civil and militarypopulation within their charges, but roughly 98 are intended primarily for ministration to troops and 40 for civil duties.3. As regards existing legislation, it is found in Bart X (sections 115 to 123) of the Government of India Act, headed &quot; Ecclesiastical Establishment.&quot; Under these sections the Bishops of Calcutta, Madras and Bombay exercise within their respective dioceses such episcopal functions and such ecclesiastical jurisdiction for the superintendence and good government of the ministers of the Church of England therein as His Majesty may by Letters Patent direct (section 1.15(1)); the Bishop of Calcutta is the Metropolitan Bishop in India, &quot; subject nevertheless to the general superintendence and revision of the Archbishop of Canterbury,&quot; and has as Metropolitan such ecclesiastical jurisdiction and functions as Plis Majesty may by Letters Patent direct (section 115 (2)); the Bishops of Madras and Bombay must take an oath of obedience to the Bishop of Calcutta in such manner as His Majesty by Letters Patent may direct (section 115 (3)), and His Majesty may by Letters Patent vary the limits of the dioceses of Calcutta, Madras and Bombay (section 115(4)). Section 117 of the same Act relates to the consecration, following on the issue by His Majesty of Letters Patent, of persons appointed to the bishopric of Calcutta, Madras or Bombay; section 119 relates to payments to representatives of the three Bishops; and section .121 prescribes that His Majesty may also make furlough rides for them.Further, the Letters Patent of the Bishops of Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay contain instructions that they should administer their offices according to the ecclesiastical laws of the Church of England.Besides these three &quot;statutory&quot; Bishops, there are in India 10 other Bishops or Assistant Bishops, whose appointment entails a submission to His Majesty, viz. four (Lncknow, Lahore, Rangoon, and Nagpur) who by arrangement derive part of their emoluments from being paid by Government as Senior Chaplains, and six others unpaid by Government (in Travancore and Cochin, Dornakal, Assam, Chota Nagpur, Tinnevelly, and Bombay an Assistant Bishop). Of the 13 Bishops or Assistant Bishops in India, one, Dr. Azariah (in Dornakal) is an Indian.4. The case for an amendment of the Government of India Act in order to liberate the Church and leave it free to organise itself as an autonomous ecclesiastical province is that, whereas a century ago the Anglican Church in India consisted almost entirely of British people temporarily resident there, such residents now number only 25 per cent, of its members, permanent European residents mostly of 4.

Assembly and Houses of Convocation. The Government of India and I are satisfied that, there now exists&apos;^general desire&quot; to ;sever -this, obsolete but hampering legal connection, and to enable the Church of England in India to constitute; satisfied&quot;elBSs?a voluntary society legally entitled to manage its own affairs (on the basis of &quot;consensual compact&quot;). This is all in the line of the evolution of the Church of England into a world-wide communion of federated Churches, and represents the stage already reached in the self-governing Dominions, United States, Japan, ancl China.5. To give effect to the proposals, (which had as early as T9.12 received the general approval of representatives of the Church in India), it was at first supposed that a &quot;Measure&quot; passed under the Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act, 1919, (i.e. the &quot; Enabling Act&apos;&quot;), would be sufficient, since a Measure for the purposes of that Act may &quot;relate to any matter concerning the Church-of England&quot;; but the Law Officers in January 1924 (Sir D. Hogg and Sir T. Inskip) suggested doubt as to the propriety of this method of repealing provisions of the Government of India Act, and their advice has been accepted. It is proposed now to introduce at the proper time both a Bill in Parliament and a draft Measure in the National Assembly of the Church of England.6. It should be clearly understood that neither Bill nor Measure purports to &quot;establish &quot; the Church in India.The main object of the first is to repeal certain provisions of the Government of India Act, of the second to provide for the dissolution of the legal union between the Church of England and the Church of England in India, and to make provision for the constitution of an Indian Church as a voluntary association free to exercise powers of self-government: but other matters of importance have had to be closely examined by the Council of India in consultation with the Government of India and the authorities of the Anglican Church in India, particularly the Bishop of Calcutta and Metropolitan (Dr. Foss Westcott) and the Bishop of Bombay (Dr. E. J. Palmer), who this year and last came specially to England for the purpose, and have been in communication both with  the Archbishop  of* In dealing with technical points I   Canterbury and with myself.*   The matters toW been advised by Mr. Aubrey Lawrence, which I have last referred relate mainly to the while the nishops have  been assisted by . , .   ,        ;      ,, ,-. -,    , ^lUr Alan Leslie &quot;    special interests of Government, ancl these mustbe shortly described. The difficulty in dealing with them has arisen chiefly from the fact that it is necessary to reconcile the claims of Government with the freedom of a self-governing Church which will not be able to fulfil its obligations towards the military and official community without the financial and other assistance it has always received from Government. The Government of India for their own. part have disclaimed in the clearest possible terms any intention to make the constitution of an Indian Church the occasion for -discontinuing or curtailing their expenditure on the Church of England in India.7. One of the main interests of Government is that British-born servants of the Crown in India, including the British Army, should not be deprived of the Ghurch of England services to which they have been accustomed in other words, that the Chaplains paid for by Government ancl the churches maintained or repaired by Government should continue to be available for the purpose for which they were intended.8. Another is that the Government Chaplains themselves, though they may reasonably be required, as they are at present required, to receive a licence from the Bishop of their diocese-a point as to which the Archbishop of Canterbury was specially consulted should be ensured equitable treatment in regard to such matters as the refusal of a licence, posting to their stations, proceedings before an Ecclesiastical Court, &amp;c.9. A third special interest is that the needs of the British troops in India should be met certainly no less satisfactorily than heretofore.10. A fourth is that in regard to property the beneficiaries of trusts should be protected in their rights.11. The ecclesiastical authorities are no less anxious than Government to secure -these results, and there has been no difference of opinion on any point of importance. But the method by which they are to be secured has been the subject of prolonged
discussion. On the one hand, the Government of India and the ecclesiastical authorities-&quot;recommended that their mutual relations should he largely a matter of &quot;honourable understanding&quot; between the parties, and that this should be based on a &quot; Statement of Intentions &quot; of the Secretary of State in Council as to the conditions in which his support would be given to the Indian Church, the document to stand by itself without reference being made to it in any legal enactment. They considered that this method, while leaving the hands of Government free from statutory obligations, would also be in accordance with the autonomy of the Indian Church.It was urged on the other hand by my Council that something more than an honourable understanding was required to protect the general interests of Government and the particular interests of the British Army, that it was necessary to take a long view and envisage the possibility of the control of the Indian Church passing largely into Indian hands, of the intrusion of political influences, and even of the Church itself ceasing to be in communion with the Church of England, in the judgment of the Bishops an unthinkable event.12. Ultimately agreement has been reached on the basis that power should be taken in the Parliamentary Bill for the Governor-General of India in Council, with the sanction of the Secretary of State in Council, to make rules with the concurrence of the Bishop of Calcutta (who would act in accordance with the &quot; Constitution &quot; to be framed by the Indian Church for its own self-government) to regulate and provide for the various matters in which Government is concerned. The Government of India have agreed to this procedure.A Bill, a Measure and Rules have now been drafted with the concurrence of the Bishops. I do not think it necessary to enter at this stage into their details beyond noting that the Bill provides Inter alia, and in addition to its rule-making clause, for the resumption by Government of control of Maintained Churches in the remote contingency of the Indian Church passing out of communion with the Church of England, a fact to be established by certificate of the Archbishop of Canterbury ; that the draft Measure mainly concerns the self-government of the Indian Church, with its &quot; General Council&quot; and a written &quot; Constitution &quot; ; and that the draft Rules provide not only for arbitration by the Archbishop of Canterbury (or someone appointed by him) in the event of breaches of the Rules, but for termination of the arrangements which the Rules embody at any time after five years&apos; notice.13. From the first I have made it plain that this legislation cannot be introduced into Parliament except with the general agreement, reasonably understood, of all the authorities and persons who are concerned ; it now has the concurrence of my own Council, of the Government of India, of the Army Council (so far as the British soldier is affected), of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and of the Provincial Council and every -Diocesan Council of the Anglican Church in India. Ex kypothesl the legislation cannot go forward unless it is supported by the National Assembby in this country. I am satisfied, therefore, that the action now being taken is justified, and indeed that Government would incur reproach if it blocked the way to a reform as to which the Anglican community in India and this country, Indians and Europeans  appear with seemingly few dissentients to be substantially agreed.Unless I hear from any of my colleagues to the contrary before 20th January next I propose to put the draft Bill before the Home Affairs Committee in time for introduction next year.BIRKENHEAD.India Office, lGth December 1926.
