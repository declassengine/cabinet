THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS ERITA3KIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.)Copy No. v/ &amp;HOUSING - SCOTLAND,STEEL HOUSES SCHEME. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland.1.     In view of the progress being made with the Government scheme for the provision of 2,000 steel houses in Scotland, it is now necessary to consider whether it should be extended.2.     At 30th October, 1926, foundations had been completed for 1,792 of the 2,000 houses;    of these 1,114 had been roofed;    780 had been taken over from the contractors; and 382 were occupied.3.     The scheme was embarked upon at the end of 1925, chiefly in conBequence of the failure of the building industry to provide the required houses.     In 1924 only 4,300 houses were built in Sootland with State assistance.     This number rose in 1925 to 8,200. An output, however, of 12,000 houses is expected in 1926 and, it is hoped that 15,000 or 16,000 houses may be completed in 1927.4,     The estimated annual wastage of Scotland is 10,000 houses with an accumulated shortage of not less than 100,000.5.     The necessity for a further scheme of steel houses is, on purely housing grounds, not so great as when the scheme was agreed to in 1925.     There is also no occasion for tho erection of further houses as a demonstration of tho suitability of the steel house.6.     Tho final cost of the 2,000 houses scheme is not yetIknown, but it is estimated that the loss to be borne by the State will be the equivaleAt of  15.15/- per house per annum for the period of 40 years, being the period of the &quot;life&quot; of the steel house for loan purposes.     At the end of that period the value of the steel houses and sites will belong to the Government.7,     The contribution of the State under the Act of 1924 to the losses of Local Authorities is  9 per house per annum for 40 years.     In addition most Local Authorities contribute  4.10/- per house, making a total State and Local Authority contribution of  13.10/-.8.     The steel house is not yet substantially less in priee than the house of ordinary construction.       The more common type of house being erected by Local Authorities is the 3-apartment flat, and prices (exclusive of land, roads, sewers, professional fees) vary from  350 to  415.     A fair figure in the industrial areas of the oentral belt would probably be from  380 to  400.     ThiB type of house under the present steel houses soheme will cost from  409 to  437 plus a sum for transport of materials varying according to the si te,9,     Messrs. Weir, however, have indicated that they would be prepared to provide this type at  387.10/- (plus transport) if liOOO more houses were ordered and at  375 (plus transport) if 2*000 more ?/ere ordered.     These prices would compare not unfavour-ably with prices of the same house by ordinary methods in areasgCPET. Ip.308 (26),where/
where transport charges would be small,10.   A note is appended shewing the prices in Glasgow of steel houses under the Government scheme and as now offered by Messrs, Weir and also the prices of corresponding houses by ordinary methods obtained this year by the Corporation,11,   There appears to be no readiness on the part of Local Authorities to proceed with steel houses and, accordingly, unless the Government scheme is continued, the probability is that the manufacturers of the steel house &quot;will close dcvn.12,   This would lead to further unemployment.     It has to be kept in mind that one reason for the inauguration of the scheme was to relieve unemployment in the engineering trades and it was made a condition of the scheme that not more than 10% of the labour should be skilled labour.     The total number of persons employed by Messrs. Weir in their factory and on the sites in the manufacture and erection of steel houses was 1,220 on 5th October, and 909 on 12th November.     Reductions are taking place at the rato of 60 per week.13.   While the steel house, so long as it is in the market, may have an influence in keeping down costs of other types of houses, the possibility of trouble with the building trades oannot be overlooked if the steel houses scheme i3 extended, in view of the improved output   of the normal methods,14,   After careful consideration of the position now reached in Scotland I have come to the conclusion that a fresh order by the State for steel houses would not be justified, except on the ground of relief of unemployment,&apos; JOHN G-ILJ50UR&apos; ,ft7th November, 1926,
