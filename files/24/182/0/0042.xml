1033 OP AN.INygKYI3W WITH H^HJUMAKIVIS OP Q?H3 BlflfifiS Pi )3BA0!lOC&quot;MOH2A&amp;U&quot;H6U3&apos;i: 1 p.nu 15&apos;JH. DBGEMBJiilR, 1926.The Miners1 Federation came to see me this afternoon and have now asked if they can meet those members of the Government whom they met on the evening of the 11th November. The position is as follows:-Where asry dispute arises as to ti^gs eligibility for benefit, the ultimate appeal is to the Umpire who is the final authority.      The Ministry of Labour is always careful to maintain this principle, and thus to remove the question from the sphere of administrative action and Parliamentary pressureSubject to the above, generally the position is that a man who is disqualified for benefit^ because he lost his employment by- reason of a stoppage -of work due to a trade dispute remains disqualified so long as that stoppage oontinues.     It is also the case that when a stoppage due to a trade dispute has ceased, in general those men who are ready to return to work are eligible for benefit in the absence of any of the ordinary causes of disallowance. In the present case, however, a number of miners have been disallowed benefit.      They are ready to return to work, but the state of the pits, or, in certain cases, of parts of the pits, is such, owing to oauses which are directly due to the stoppage, that pits or parts of pits are not open for work.After the mining stoppage of 1921, the Umpire held that where non-resumption was owing to disrepair of pits, the stoppage due to the dispute continued and the men were consequently still disqualified from benefit.In the case of the present dispute, the Ohief Insurance Officer, in my opinion quite rightly, oalled the attention of Local Officers in the different districts, to these rulings/in
In those eases, therefore, whore there is still non-resumption owing to disrepair caused by the stoppage, Unemployment Benefit is at present withheld.-The Miners&apos; representatives claimed that in the course of the evening of the 11th November they were given to understand by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for India, and myself, that this cause of dis-qualification should not apply in the present case, and legislation should be introduced, if necessary, to ensure this.I stated,    in reply, that so far as the conservations on the 11th November were concerned, any-undertaking, even supposing there were one (which I did not admit), could no longer be held as binding-     A possible undertaking offered as part of an agreement which was subsequently refused by one side oould not be claimed by that side afterwards as binding.The miners then replied that the assurances referred to by them were definitely given irrespective of pny pgreeuent; further, that this particular case must have been present to the minds of those members of the Government who were there, and especially to myself, and that therefore, it was tantamount to a breach of faith with them not to see that benefit should be given in these cases.I told them that this was quite distinctly not the case.     I further said that if they had this type -of case in their mind, with their experience of the 1921 stoppage, they ought to have definitely and explicitly h&amp;a&amp;sp brought if forward, and that they did not do so;    I added that it was not present  to my mind, but that even so (as-my colleagues will remember) I was conscious that in a technical matter of this kind, speoial reasons not known to me at the time, might exist for disqualification.I therefore in my own   &apos; remarks made an express reservation to cover this possibility.
1 was Sj.ro quite sure that my colleagues had no knowledge of these p&amp;rtioultor instances which might except es^es from the general law which allows workmen after a dispute is over to he eligible for benefit.I advise^the deputation that theyf proper course was to get the cases to whioh they referred brought before the Umpire as soon as possible.      I stated that while of course the decision rested with him there was reason to anticipate that as soon as he was satisfied that any delay in the resumption Of work could no longer be attributed directly or immediately to causes due to the stoppagei he would allow benefit.     On this point I quoted a decision given quite recently where benefit was allowed although only 60 per cent, of the undergDund workers had been re-employed.They expressed themselves very dissatisfied.    They laid stress again on what they called the assurances given by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for India, and asked if they might meet the coal committee of the Government again upon the subject.I then informed them that I would communicate their request to my colleagues with as little delay as possible, but that I oould give them no assurance that my colleagues would,oonsent, or, if they did consent, when they would be able to meet them.I may add for the information of my oolleagues that the disqualification for benefit is probably in most cases only transitory.I am informed in my office that as soon as a reasonable time for repair of a pit has elapsed, it is probable that the umpire would then decide if the case is raised that non-resumption is due to other oauses than the effect of the coal/stoppage
A copy is attaohed of the relevant passages of the verbatim Report of the meeting on 11th and 12th November, op which they base their claim, and whioh have been widely circulated by the Federation in the coalfields.I would suggest that a reasoned answer should he sent to the Miners1 Federation definitely refusing to meet them.stoppage operating in the pit or in part &quot; of the pit concerned.     Thus, while perhans 100,000 men (chiefly in South Wales) were affected ten days ago, this number will bo reduoed very quickly.     It is possible that the position may be quickly relieved for this reason but I cannot be confident of this.
EXTRACT    PROM   DISCUSSION    BETWEEN   CABINET COAL    COMMITTEE    AND    MINERS&apos;    FEDERATION, NOVEMBER    11TH   AND    12 TH,    1926.SIR   ARTHUR   STEEL-MAITLAND:    There are now three points which you raise, not on the paper but outside.     One, that there should be no victimisation and that the matter should be dealt with as in the 1921 Agreement.    (2) that there should be unemployment provision for those for whom no work can be found for the time being. *   MR. CHURCHILL:   After the dispute has been settled.SIR   ARTHUR   STEEL-MAITLAND:    After the dispute has been settled, and our answer is we ask you to take that paper away -MR.&apos; CHURCHILL:    There was a third point,SIR   ARTHUR   STEEL-MAITLAND:    There was a third point as regards recruiting, and the answers are as follows, - as regards unemployment provision for those for whom there is no ^sork to be found, our opinion is that the existing Unemployment Insurance law will give you the assurance you want, that when pits re-open -MR.    HERBERT   SMITH:    But it does not carver us*SIR   ARTHUR   STEEL-MA 1TLAND:    If you rti.ll allow me to finish as regards this point, Mr. Smith.   We believe there should be no trouble from your point of view under the Unemployment Insurance Act. This has nothing to do with the old questions about which you have been to see me, those old questions on which we have differed.   Our opinion is this, that when pits re-open which have been closed because of the stoppage, those who are then unemployed providing nothing else comes up, will be able to get unemployment insurance0 That is all.MR.    CHURCHILL:   Are eligible for benefitsSIR   ARTHUR   STEEL-MAITLAND:    They are eligible for benefit,********** ****** i *******MR.    CHURCHILL:    The unemployment point is quite satisfactory to you really. We are  advased that your men will be eligible when/the
the stoppage is over for unemployment 103111 ent relief.    That is the advice we are given.LC1&quot;0 &apos;JII.XV3THEAD:     And if that is not so, I under stand the intention is to put it right.LE. CHURCHILL:     An Umpire here or there may give a special award which might affect a small number of men, and that is a matter we would give speoial consideration to as far as that point is concornod.    7s aro not giving you anything beyond what is law, but tho law according to what we are advised is in your favour.MR. HERBERT SL1ITH:  &apos;  Bo, Sir, it goes against the minor every time. Hie is the worst case there is under the Act.LORD BIRK3NHEAD:      Are you advised in law that these men are not entitled to unemployment benefit?MR. HERBERT SLilTH:      IThat I am talking about Lord Birkenhead is worse than law to mo.   You may be honest and your intentions good, but I say that an engineer, or a Joiner, or a builder can go and get unemployment pay, but our men cannot undor oxactly similar conditions.LORD 3IKKEKHEAD:      I will give you my opinion in law for what it is worth-    That no Court in this country could rofuso a claim in that way.   You can make a note of it;    if I am wrong then the Govern-ment is committed by my opinion and matters can be put right-SIR ARTHUR STESL-I.1AITLAKD:      I have beon perfectly frank with you over unemployment matters.    I know your troubles.MR. COOK:      It Is all right for Lord Birkonhead to say at law they are entitled to it, but as Sir ilrthur Steel-llaitland knows whon a pit is doolared open, If they havo a reduction, more than the reduction ooncedod nationally, because the men have not accepted that reduction, it is not a trade dispute at all, they aro refused unemployment pay. &apos; ..,i.lR. RICHARDSON:     We shall seo if we do hotter now than we have i done in the past.
