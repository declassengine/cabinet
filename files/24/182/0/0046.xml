THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT316CABINET.TRADE OUTLOOK. Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.I have delayed sending my monthly trade review, as the meeting of my Advisory Council at the beginning of this month waa too near the end of the coal strike for any reliable appreciation to be given.   The members of the Council have, however, been good enough to send me a later appreciation, whioh I now circulate.It is still too early to say how far the placing of orders is due to the necessity for replenishing stocks depleted and filling contracts held up by the Strike, and how far such orders are attributable to new and increasing business.    There is certainly a general feeling of optimism, and the following features may be noted:-Coal prices are swinging down to normal a good deal earlier than had been expected.     This is good for industry, and is incidentally a lesson for the Coalowners.    It is always rash to prophesy about the ooal trade, but my impression is that the early Bummer will see coal prices at a low level.In steel the demand for special steels is good, and the prospects in the ordinary steel industry look better. Here of course there is a great accumulation of orders held up by the strike.   A fair number of orders have been placed for ships, and this will help the steel trade.    The wire position is better.    I think this is probably due to the fact that an arrangement has been made with the Continent.      In tin plate there Is the possibility of aSECRET.CP.421(26).
useful development of the canning industry in this country, and I understand that the Ministry of Agriculture are helping in research work in this connection.The electrical manufacturers look forward to a considerable increase in trade, more especially in the latter part of   next year..-.        A good deal of the heavier work is likely to be taken at out prices.    The industry has certainly made a good bid to increase its share of the export trade.    The cotton industry Is still very depressed, and prospectB are uncertain.    The woollen and worsted industry remains depressed.   French competition is less severe, but German competition is more intense.    The rubber industry, apart from a wail about tyre prices, is good.    It should be noted that the member of my Council who reports that English firms cannot stand the present reduction in the price of tyres is not connected with the Dunlop Company; and the latter Company is responsible for the bulk of the output of tyres.    In chemicals, apart from fertilisers, prospects are better.    There is a better outlook in the food trades.    There are plenty of orders for hardware a,t the present time; and in the boot and shoe industry prospects are reasonably good.(Intld.) P.C.-L.Board of Trade,20th December, 1926.

CONFIDENTIAL. IRON AND STEEL,Mr, DORMAN wrote on 13th December:-&quot;Although there has not been an immediate general resumption of work in the Iron and Steel Trade since the cessation of the coal strike, a number of Blast Furnaces have been put Into commission.   This has enabled a few Steel Plants and Rolling Mills to be re-started, but. until supplies of coal and coke are more assured, all Steelmakers have to adopt a policy of extreme caution.There are indications that a shortage of coke is probable, due amongst other things to the fact that a large number of Coke Ovens were put out of commission during the strike, and the resulting delay in re-starting will hold up the production of coke for some weeks.Operations at fcsteei Plants and Rolling Mills are hindered by the scarcity of iron, and this will be the general case until the various Blast Furnace Plants are in operation, and I think it will be well into the New Year before normal operations can possibly be resumed, when it Is probable that there will be more Blast Furnaces in commission than there were Immediately prior to the strike.There are practically no stocks of iron and steel in this country, and with the Works idle for 7 months orders have been accumulating, and it is apparent that a more prosperous time is in front of the trade than has been experienced for a number of years .There is a shortage of Continental pig iron, the price asked to-day varying from 8l/- to 85/- c.i.f. East Coast Ports .There has been a fall in the price of Continental sheet bars.    The price now asked is  in the  region of  5.14.6 c.i.f.Wire Trade.   This branch of the industry is held up through a shortage of billets owing to the Heavy Steel Works not yet being able to resume their usual operations.   Ag soon as adequate supplies of material can be obtained they will get away There is a steady demand for wire ropes, particularly for replacements in the British Collieries, but the export trade is quieter.   Generally, however, the condition of this industry pan be described as more satisfactory.Shee t Trade .    The position of this trade is quieter,prices for Galvanised Sheets having eased off, and makers are now offering sheets for delivery during the first quarter of 1927. Black Sheets however are firm, particularly for the home market, but the general condition of the trade is not as satisfactory as it was two months ago.It is too early yet to make any very definite statement with regard to Constructional Engineering, as all firms are waiting for supplies of material from rolls, and until the mills resume operations the work in hand will be more or less held up.Shipbuilding.     Orders for a number of ships have been placed, and&quot;&quot;the general feeling in this branch of the industry is more hopeful than has been evinced for some time.&quot;-1-
STEEL.SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR wrote on 13th December:-&quot;There is really an ample supply of both Coke and Coal but owing to the complete denuding of all Pig Iron in the country, the Steel Works are only commencing to operate very slowly and the position of the Rolling Kills and Forges is, if anything, more difficult than it was during the latter period of the strike.Home Trade has begun to revive.    The Export trade continues decidedly good, but a number of orders have been cancelled owing to non-delivery.    In several directions - and unfortunately this applies to certain kinds&apos;of special Steel, - the Germans and the French have captured customers, and in the case of the French at very low prices, and some of this trade is going to be very difficult to recover.    The Canadian, Australian and New Zealand trade continues good.    The South African trade - moderate.    The South American trade has revived somewhat and we are again securing a large number of the contracts for which we tender in competition with Germany.    The Chinese trade In spite of War conditions is satisfactory, but care of course has to be taken to see that money is received with order, or at least a portion of it.    The Japanese trade still hangs fire and is very difficult.    There is nothing new to report about the French and Italian trade.    This cannot be expected to improve very much until the currency is stabilised.    The Belgian trade has been somewhat hit by the stabilisation of the currency and the necessary adjustments of balance sheets and stocks, and has slowed down in consequence.It is extraordinary the amount of trade that Is being done in view of the difficult circumstances with which the Sheffield firms have had to cope.As regards Coal and Coke the prices are still too high. Crucible Steel Melting Coke is being offered at 55/- but provided one is willing to contract for one year for Coal It is possible to place contracts at 2/- or 3/- per ton above the pre-strike price.I have the impression that the Coal Situation will settle down very quickly&quot;.NON-FERROUS METALS. SIR CECIL BUDD wrote on 13th December -&quot;There is at present no perceptible revival following the termination of the coal strike, and the actual volume of business passing remains small.   This, however, is not unusual towards the end of the year,- which is the general period for stock-taking, and I am glad to report that there Is a general expectation, based on, I think, solid grounds, -that there will be a widening of operations in the early part of next year.    There seems a prospect of increased orders for the home markets, and. that the competition from the Continent in export markets may be less severe than it has been&apos;1.
SHIPBUILDING AND MOTOR MANUFACTURE.Sir John Thornycroft wrote on December 13th:-&quot;Orders have been placed for a number more vessels but firms generally are of opinion that the contracts have been entered into at prices which will be unremunerative to the Shipbuilding firms. It will be some months before the yardsobtain supplies of material to enable them to increase the number of men they employ.     A campaign is being made up by shipbuilding employers to try and get their men to waste less time at starting and finishing.      It was definitely promised by the men&apos;s leaders that, when the 47 hour week was granted, the employers should get 47 hours work,  but there is just as much time lost in starting work and at the end of the day a s there was before the change. If it is assumed that five minutes is lost at each time of stopping and starting in a firm employing 3,000 men, it represents-, something like a loss of  14,000 a year.With regard to the Motor Industry, during the last week Balance Sheets have ,been published of two well-known firms showing very heavy losses, and there is a good deal of anxiety on the part of firms who have a large amount of work in hand in regard to their material.    It having been impossible to get their supplies from well-tried sources in this country they have bought abroad and feel that it is a gamble if the various parts and components made from it will prove satisfactory.Great anxiety is felt by employers in the Shipbuilding and Engineering Industry generally as to the Government taking adequate action in dealing with the Trades Unions.     A great deal has been saio by Government speakers and others about the necessity of a better feeling between employers and employed, and profit-sharing, but it is felt that there is very little chance of employers doing any good as long as the extremists are at liberty through the minority movement and their Communists nuclei in the various centres and works, to prevent any real spirit of co-operation.      It is the fashion for many people   to say that this sort of thing Is greatly exaggerated, but employers who have taken the trouble to investigate know that it is at the bottom of their labour difficulties.Practically all firms now are suffering from shortage of cash, partly because they have made no profits and largely owing to the amounts they have had to pay out for E.P.D. and Munitions Levy.      Cash is wanted to improve their plant and to enable credit to be given for sales abroad,  but it is difficult to obtain, and there is little doubt that the difficulty is largely owing to the distrust ?which the public generally have in British industry under the present labour conditions.&quot;ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES. Sir Philip Nash wrote on December 14th:-rtI propose to desl with the subject of the position of the Electrical Industry separately for Home and Export markets.
CONFIDENTIAL. ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES. (CON TD . )HOME MARKET.In normal times electrical manufactuaters are accustomed to a steady market for electrical apparatus from industries located in Great Britain.      This demand has been very much below normal for tne last six months due to the complete closing   down of the coal mining industry, the almost complete closing down of the iron and steel industry, and the effect on other Industries generally due to difficulties in   -obtaining fuel supplies,   and the high price of such supplies.The Electricity Supply Bill which has been so long under consideration by Parliament has also acted as a restric-tion on purchases by power undertakings throughout the year. Recently,  however, due to the prolonged delay in the final stages of the Bill in Parliament,   important electric supply undertakings have been forced to obtain sanction from the Electricity Commissioners to undertake extensions and renewals, but these orders have only recently been placed.   As soon as the new Act is in operation, greater activity in generating plant,  and above all, for transmission and distribution apparatus,  should result, but not immediately, as the new Central Authority will require- to be set up and to function before important works can be sanctioned.    It will probably be in the  second half of 1927 before there will be any marked xncrease in this direction.The coal strike has also had an important effect on the electric lamp industry.    Mot only has there been a cessation in demand for lamps for the coal mining industry, and a very greatly reduced demand from industrial concerns generally, but the unavoidable restrictions during the last six months in the, consumption of current for lighting purposes generally, e.g./ suppression of display lighting,  reduction in shop and street lighting, etc. have all operated in the direction of reduced consumption of lamps.    On the other hand, the coal shortage has stimulated interest in electrical equipment generally; and, granted better financial conditions,  this increased interest in electrical apparatus should result in strengthening the home demand from industry generally.Again, the process of amalgamation and reorganisation, such as has taken place recently in the chemical industry,  and is being considered by other Industries, especially coal mining, Iron and steel, etc.,  should improve the financial conditions of such industries and render possible modernisation,   and improvement of their manufacturing facilities,   In both of which electricity will assuredly play an Important part.Summing up the prospects of the Home market for 1927 I would say that there is a considerable lee-way to be made up by the electric power undertakings, and as soon as the Electricity Act is in operation, nothing should prevent demand froi such undertakings being, considerably increased in the second half of 192-7.        If the demand for heavy plant should become pronounced in Great Britain, very serious
M^CTJRJGAL INDUSTRIE  (GONTD .)competition may be expected from the Swiss, Swedish,   and German manufaeturera a    They will seize the opportunity to try and obtain a volume of work at very low prices.    The British manufacturer cannot retaliate,  due to protective tariffs in these countries.As regards demands from Home industries,  I think that certain urgent requirements will be forthcoming at once, but.,  due to financial conditions any important electrical requirements will have to be deferred until later in the year.The demand and greater use of domestic electrical apparatus is steadily proceeding,  and I see no reason why this should not make good and regular progress.EXPORT MARKET,The coal strike cannot be said to have interfered very seriously with either the amount of business in electrical plant, etc. obtained by this country,  or by delay in shipments, although there has been some delay in delivery.   The value of export shipments made during the first nine months of this year has been practically the sa.ie as for the corresponding period of 1925, but shipments are now being made more freely, and in my opinion the total shipments,  in value,  for 1926, will constitute a record for this country.Below are certain figures of exports of electrical machinery and apparatus from the five principal countries1913of , Total192 3of i otal &apos;1924f -of Total* *, a ,Spain,,.. ifnany, &apos;bj.a&amp;advance .......rtzerland. . 7, 655,700 &apos; 23*415, 887,700 - 48.55,790,000 &apos; 17,72,185,000 6,71,240,000 3.7total..... 32,758,400    100.0 14,346,000 14,204,000 15,500,000 .  3,540,000 1,970,00028,9 &apos; 16,034,000 j 26,928.7 !   14,246,000 j 25 0731.3 !   18,500,000 : 33,47.2 i     4,550,000 i 8.23.9 ;     2,100,000 &apos; 5,849,560,000100.0 I   55,430,000 ; 100.0Jain.....Pany    . ..**,,,..jjjpce......itzerland.1925f of Total 17,351,000 16,021,000 18,000,000 5, 800,000 2,400,000Pi ; ! &apos;ptal... ,. 57,572,000 ;100 e0   i    45, 001, 000 j 100 ,0
ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES  (OONTD.)The high figures of Germany for 1925 and 1926 are very largely in increased sales of wireless apparatus,  oables, batteries, lamps, and meters.     In heavy electrical machinery, in traction material,  and in large industrial motors, Germany has lost ground during the last few years, whereas Great Britain has strengthened, even in 1926, her hold on the overseas markets.Comparison of price per ton of finished electrical machinery exported shows that the British figures have been stationery all through 1924, 1925 and 1926, with a slight tendency to rise in the third quarter of this year.   German prices are- rising steadily towards the British prices.   Swiss prices have been falling, and can only be explained as being the result of a deliberate policy to develop the export side of the Swiss electrical trade even at the risk of loss from uneconomic conditions of oontraat.It will be seen from the figures given that the electrical manufacturers in Great Britain are obtaining a good share of the overseas market in spite of the burdens of high transport charges and taxation of manufacturers.   A rise in cost of fuel or In raw or partly finished materials at the present time would operate most adversely on the position.    The selling prices at which the British manufacturer obtains oontracts against world competition in themselves may be said to be unremunerative, but the volume of work obtained from these markets is vital to the welfare of the industry in this country.   Not only are these contracts vital from the point of view of the volume of work in the shops, but they are equally vital to the industry if it is to keep in the forefront in the world&apos;s market,  since our home market does not create the demand for the most modern development of electrical plant, and the British manufacturer must,  therefore, gain his experience in the overseas market,  otherwise he must drop behind in matters of experience and design compared with the American and German contractors.    The British manufacturer has also in these days to meet,  to a greater extent than formerly,  the demand for extended terms of credit in certain markets abroad if he is to maintain his position.GENERAL.In conclusion,  it appears to me that the prospects of the electrical manufacturing industry for 1927 are good,  and in a year&apos;s time it is possible that the industry will be very fully occupied ?COTTON.SIR W. CLARE LEES wrote on 13th December:-&quot;There has not been any very marked Improvement In orders booked in Manchester, but there has been during the last ten days a considerable increase of sme.ll orders that have found their way on to the Order Books,  and this tendency is  continuing at the present time.
COTTON    (CONTD.).A large number of offers are being received, but prices are too low for acceptance. I think this would tend to show that the world is 1 trying-out&apos; the position with a view to ascertaining &quot;rock bottom&apos; prices, and the orders which are being booked show that a certain amount of confidence Is re-asserting itself, which will doubtless increase as time goes on.The coal position Is rapidly becoming normal.   A good deal of dear imported coal remains to be consumed, which will continue to cause losses to those concerned, probably up to the end of the year&quot;.COLONEL SEDDON BROWN wrote on 13th December:-&quot;The improvement which everybody was hoping would take place at the termination of the Coal Strike has not yet materialised,  so far as the Cotton Trade is concerned.Within a very few days of the Coal Strike coming to an end, fuel was available at reasonable prices and mills were in a position to run, if their order books warranted it.    Unfortunate-ly, however, the increased volume of business, which was expected, has not yet come forward.    There is still a feeling in the market that Cotton, in spite of its very big drop In price, may not yet have reached the bottom, and there appears to be a general lack of confidence amongst buyers.The report of the United States Bureau Department Issued last Wednesday, December 8th, forecasts a crop of American Cotton totalling 18,618,000 bales, of which 14,618,u00 bales were ginned by November 30th.    The prospects of such an enormous supply of Cotton has thoroughly shaken the confidence of buyers as regards price.    It would appear that an increased business is not likely to be done&apos; until buyers feel that Cotton has reached approximately Its lowest figure.    There Is considerably more enquiry in the market, but owing to the above mentioned lack of confidence it is not yet materialising into business or finding its way on to the order books of Manufacturers and Spinners.The Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Association^ decided on December 3rd to relieve its members&quot; from their pledge, whereby they undertook to observe minimum selling prices for American Yarns.    It is regretted that this decision was not reached owing to an improvement of trade, but owing to the fact that many Spinners had ceased to cax^ry out their pledges in this direction.    The Federation further decided that, commencing from Monday last the 6th December, mills spinning American Yarn should work 35 hours per week.The withdrawal of minimum prices has caused prices of American Yarns to slump somewhat further, and although the mills are on short-time, business is generally unprofitable. In the Egyptian Section of the Spinning Industry mills are running full time, but the margin of profit has become reduced, and the immediate outlook is not very good.
COTTON (CONTD).In the Weaving Section of the Industry a large number of looms are still standing empty, but since the termination of the Coal Strike there has been a tendency in some districts to begin filling up some of these looms with work.    Generally speaking the conditions in the Cotton Trade at the moment are bad, and I do not look for much improvement this side of the New Year.    It is hoped, however, that if Cotton Prices become stabilised at anything like to-day&apos;s low figure there should be an Increase in the volume of business early in the New Year&quot;.WOOL.24R. ANDREWS wrote on the 16th December:-&quot;Now that the Strike is over, the Trade is obtaining Coal almost as low in price as in April.    In some cases the Merchants have resumed delivery of contracts which had not expired at the April prices.    This will be of considerable assistance to the Trade, and has brought Conversion Coots down to the April level.    Generally speaking, there is no improve-ment up to the present, nor is any immediate improvement expected; as the Trade is perfectly aware that the Iron, Steel, and Shipbuilding Trades will have to resume employment, and some time will have bo be allowed   for the Employees in these Trades to pay off the debts aocummulated during the period of unemployment, before they are in. a position to resume purchases of any considerable quantity of Wool Textile Fabrics.So far as competition from France is conoerned, it is now more favourable to usOn account of the appreciation of the Franc, the French Manufacturers have been compelled to advance their prices.The German competition, however, is becoming severe, and is likely to play a considerable part during the- next yoar. On the whole,  the settlement of the Coal Strike has lifted a considerable load off the minds of Traders, arid they are inclined to look forward to the future with increased   - -confidence.     The last six months has been a very trying period and heavy losses have been made in Spinning and Weaving. Employers now feel that in the future they will be at any rate, able to obtain cost prioe with a possibility of being able to make a profit as Trade gradually improves&quot;.WOOLLEN &amp; WORSTED.SIR MAX MUSPRATT sent in the following report from the Federation of British Industries, on 15th December:-&quot;The general tone of the raw material market has improved, prices of home grown wool having remained fairly firm.    Holders now   appear to have more confidence with regard to the future.    New business in yarns has &quot;been &quot;patchy&quot;, a great deal of the recent business being of a speculative character.    Spinners seem to be more optimistic with regard
WOOLLEN AND WORSTED (OONTD).to the outlook for next year.   Rather more activity is reportod in the piece goods trade, the demand being not only confined to the Christmas trade.   Moreconfidence has been shown of late and covering orders for the Spring trade appear to bo coming forward in increasing quantitios.    The Canadian market continues to be tho best overseas outlet and buyers are again operating on a fair scale.    More business has emanated from the South American markets, but in the majority of oases, the orders are for small quantities.    Thero is nothing new to report from the Far East.    On the whole, there is much more room for optimism with regard to the piece (roods soction than has been the case for the past six months or so&quot;.ARTIFICIAL SILK.MR. ADDISON wrote on 10th December -&quot;Enquiries shew that there is no material change in the Artificial Silk Market and the position remains unaltered from last month.    There is, however, a faint undercurrent of opinion that the New Year will see a better demand in the Home Trade.    The Overseas Market shews no change&quot;.CHEMICALS.MR. PERRY wrote on 17th December:-&quot;Volume of Trade.Heavy Chemicals.    The demand is improving and prospects generally are good, but the fertiliser section continues to be subjected to severe and increasing continental competition, which has not so far decreased in consequence of the stabilisation&apos; of or the appreciation of ooni-inental our*n&amp;no-y,. This section of the Industry, coupled with tne Sulphuric Acid trade, continues to labour under the serious disadvantage of being compelled to carry far too much idle plant, and it is no exaggeration to say that the prospects disclose little hope of 40% of the plant in these sections being brought into operation during 1927.Fine Chemicals.    The volume of business continues to be good, and new commodities have been added to the list. Prospects are favourable, but some anxiety is felt on the score of legislative disturbances.    In this connection the scope of the new &quot;List H&quot; is a factor giving rise to doubts in the minds of the manufacturers as to whether restriction of markets may not result in swelling the importation of other chemicals.
CHEMICALS.  (CONTD.) Earning Power.The most serious effect of the recent Coal Strike at the present time is the very heavy rise in the cost of overseas freight.      Chemical Industry depends largely on raw materials frcm overseas0     The industry also depends largely on overseas trade for the consumption of its commodities,     In both cases the severe rise in freight is making &quot;business at a profit&quot; extremely difficulty and unless freight rates fall in the next few months, the earning power of the industry and Its consequent ability   to produce large sums in taxation must be seriously Impaired&quot;.POTTERY.Mr, HoLLINS wrote on 15th December&quot;So far as I am informed the Trade is very quiet just now, and there are few inquiries; of course this is fairly usual   -about this time of the year and early In the new year,.     As compared with the same period last year, trade is a little better. The fuel price to msnufacturers has been reduced to within 3/-to 4/- per ton of the pre-coal-stoppage price.      Of course the Sanitary trades and Tile trade are an exception to the above, and are fairly busy, and will continue to be so for some time.&quot;RU3BER.Mr. JOHNSTON wrote on 13th December:-&quot;In surveying the situation of the Rubber Manufacturing Industry It is desirable, for purposes of convenience, to classify the Industry into four principal divisions, viz.,1, Tyres.2, Rubber Footwear.3. Engineering Rubber Goods.4, General Rubber Goods includingClothing,Surgical,Sports, Toys,  etc.TYRES.      So far as the first classification is concerned, viz., Tyres, the demand from the general motoring public for replacement,Tyres will naturally   be stimulated by the more optimistic feeling prevailing, but will otherwise follow the ordinary seasonal trend,  i,e. it is unlikely to be materially effected until the Spring demand steps in. The demand from the Chassis Makers will undoubtedly be   stimulated by   the   greater   volume   of   business    in   cars.
RUBBER  (COI-ITD.).An unfortunate development has, however,  arisen within the last few days in the case of car tyres.    A French Manufacturer, the Michelin Company,  created a serious situation by notifying a reduction on prices  (which are already unduly low),  averaging about 25/5.    The result of this reduction is so&apos; serious that no important British Tyre Manufacturer has,  so far, found it possible to follow.    The French firm referred to are at present manufacturing under depreciated currency conditions,  but are erecting a factory in this country,  in respect of which they have been given free land,  siding facilities,  reduced rates,  and many other advantages which no British Manufacturer enjoys.    It is possible that their action is with the object of creating a larger trade against the time when their factory is in production, but in the meantime,  it has created a serious situation,  as tyres cannot be manufactured under British conditions at these prices (which are far under pre-war),  except at a loss.Rubber Footwear.    As regards Rubber Footwear,  so far as Plimsolls and Canvas Shoes are concerned,  this branch is also buffering from severe competition from France and Germany,  so much so that entirely unprofitable prices are now prevailing. Other sections of the trade, however,  consisting of Rubber Boots, Rubber Overshoes,  etc. are in a very satisfactory condition,  the demand consistently increasing and prices, notwithstanding considerable foreign competition, being still on a remunerative basis.    In this case the competition is from America and Canada and reasonable competitive conditions prevail. There is no doubt that in this branch of the Rubber Trade the cessation of the Coal dispute will cause increased demand, particularly as the buying season is just in full swing.Engineering Rubber Goods.    As regards General Engineering Rubber Goods,  there is no doubt that the cessation of the Strike will bring about a reawakening of demand.    These goods are used In greater or lesser quantities in almost every factory throughout the country,  and a return to full production in these factories will necessitate the purchase of considerable quantities of Rubber Goods of various types.    in addition,  the greater activity in Shipbuilding and Constructional Engineering Industries will also produce considerable call for Engineering Rubber Goods,General Rubber Goods.    As reg ards the hundred and one articles coming under the description of General Rubber Goods, those will all feel the effect of any increased buying power on the part of the general public,  and hence,   the cessation of the Strike is bound to have a good effect on this section of the Rubber Industry.Generally speaking,  the Rubber Industry has managed to continue manufacturing at a high percentage of its total productive capacity during the whole period of the Strike, and the general opinion is entertained that business will certainly show an upward tendency now that this disadvantage has been removed&quot;.
FOOD INDUSTRIES.SIR STANLEY MACHIN wrote on 13th December:-&quot;The result of the Coal Strike has proved disastrous and there seems little chance for substantial improvement until the consequences of living on credit have been overcome.Unfortunately the termination of the strike -came too late to materially effect the important Christmas trade.The larger distributors, who early in the season ordered some 50/a or less of their normal demands, are sold out and it is too late to enable them to fully replenish their supplies and get them distributed in time for the Christmas season.writing as a manufacturer&quot;, we are now having an unusual number of rush orders, but it would be quite impossible to in any way make up for the time that has been lost in consequence of the strike.I am pleased, however, to state that so far as the future is concerned., the feeling of optimism, to which I referred in my last,  is maintained, and although it must take some months before trade can really settle down, greatly Improved conditions are looked for in the near future.I would like again to refer to the spirit that is being exhibited by the workers and I can find, no kind of ill feeling existing in consequence of the recent labour disputes&quot;.SCOTTISH CO-OPERATIVE WHOLESALE SOCIETY,  LIMITED.MR. GALLAGHER wrote on 13th December -&quot;We show decreases for the week ending 4th December in practically every distributive department.    Our productive works are also showing considerable decreases.    It will be some time yet before the resumption of work in the Mining Industry will produce an. appreciable effect upon our sales.   We are hoping that with the advent of 1927 there will be a considerable revival in shipbuilding and steelmaking, and. this will undoubted-ly re-act favourably on,all our activities.    There is a feeling of optimism in Scotland as to the prospects of trade in the forthcoming year.Our debts are down from a few months ago, and this is a very gratifying sign, and a reliable portent.   Altogether we are very hopeful of the near future bringing us back to normality -and perhaps giving us an increase of trade over the corresponding period.We held our Quarterly General Meeting in Edinburgh on Saturday last, 11th December, and the general feeling of the Shareholders&apos; representatives was that the worst was over, and we would rapidly make headway with the coming of the New Year1&quot;,.
GENERAL TRADE.Report forwarded by MR. GILBERT VY.LS on 14%h Dece/december:-Association of British Chambers of Commerce. Report on State of Trades.BIRMINGHAM.Reports in the general Hardware Trade are to the effect that the position is gradually becoming easier owing to the greater supplies of fuel that are available, and the fact that supplies of raw material are coming forward in greater quantities.    It is generally believed that the Immediate prospects are bright.   Many orders which it was not possible to fill during the Coal Stoppage are being pushed forward as rapidly as possible, and an increasing number of new enquiries is reported.During the Coal Stoppage, many difficulties were encountered in tho Building Trades owing to the shortage of materials, but now that building operations throughout the district are being gradually resumed with full staffs of operatives, the demand for buildei-s &apos; hardware of all kinds and general ironmongery is improving.    The conditions in the Export Trade are going satisfactorily so far as markets in the over-seas    Dominions and South America aro concerned.DUNDEE.The Jute trade is fairly well employed but orders are very scarce and so prices are unremunerative.    This also applies to the Flax trade.    There is quite a hopeful outlook in Shipbuilding but the effect of the Coal Strike on Textile and General Engineering has not worn off.    A revival, however, Is looked for in the near future.KIDDERMINSTER.The staple trade is Carpets which in common with most trades has had a most difficult time.    The year opened well and up till April demands were excellent and the prospects for the summer, generally a quiet period, were more than usually good. The General Strike and the long continued Coal Strike wrecked these hopes.   We may congratulate ourselves however that the Carpet trade suffered less than most industries.   But It must be admitted that it would have been in a most parlous state had it not been for the large demands from the British Dominions, especially Australia,  New Zealand,  and South Africa, also South America and Northern Europe.LIVERPOOL.Timber Trade.    The cessation of the Coal Strike has not produced any marked effect in the Liverpool Timber Trade, as the tonnage diverted for the carrying of  coal has not yet returned to the old channels.    It is expected that higher freight rates will operate for the first month or two of 1927. Supplies are normal
CONFIDENTIAL. GENERAL TRADE (OONTD.).with some scarcity of various items.    It is anticipated that the demand for timber will be maintained in the New Year and that ample supplies will be available.Sugar Trade.    It is difficult to give a clear opinion of the effect of the settlement of the Coal Dispute, except that it has enabled certain Sugar Refineries, which had been stopped owing to lack of Coal to start work again.The Sugar Market ha3 advanced in price over  2 a ton lately, but this advance has been caused mainly by the action of the Cuban President in interfering with supply and demand by legisla-tive restrictions of the coming Cuban crop.I^ron and Steel.      There is bound to be some improvement, and this wfTl proFabiy come very soon,    in the steel trade no time has been lost in restarting,  and some of the manufacturers are getting to work with surprising rapidity, mainly on carrying out their old contracts to which they were committed before the strike started.    A good deal hinges on coal and the sooner prices come down to pre-strike level and even lower the better it will be for the trade.LEITH.Coal Exporting.    The conclusion of the coal dispute and resumption of shipping have already produced many enquiries from foreign markets,  altnough prices are still too high to compete with those of German,  French and Belgian Collieries.    Notwith-stahding,-  outside firms in all the ports are taking small lots of British coal.    Foreign markets are expected to be regained. The coal export trade at the Port may,  therefore, be said to be rising - if slowly.LEICESTER.Hosiery Section.    It is probably now too late to expect any improvement for 1926.    Further,  the high price of coal,  electric power,  etc. have made the cost of some of our goods prohibitive, and this of itself has enabled Foreign countries to get still larger orders in this country, which have been promptly delivered. We are afraid it will be a long time before our Industry will assume normal proportions.Shoe Factors.    The position of the Boot and Shoe Trade as far as it affects the Wholesale Distributors,  is at present one of considerable financial anxiety,  largely caused by the inability of Retailers in the large industrial areas to pay their accounts, but we think the prospect of a considerable easement in this respect now that the Coal dispute is settled,-is very bright indeed,  and there is a spirit of confidence in the Trade now which has not obtained for the past few years.NEWCASTLE.Since the coal strike came to an end there Is a feeling of reasonable optimism   and provided we can have peace now for some time to come we should have quite a revival Of our industries.
GENERAL    TRAD?] (CONTP) .It is too early to speak of the Coal Export Trade, but shipbuilding is improving a little;    a number of orders having been placed on the Tyne.    Engineering Is also improving a little.NORTHAMPTON.A much better tone exists throughout the footwear and leather trades since the ending of the coal dispute. Spring orders are coming forward very well, though in some cases they are not as large as in former years. There is a strong feeling of confidence &quot;that, with freedom from labour troublesin the great Industries,  the boot and leather trades here will continue to Improve. Factories are now fairly busy. Export trade moderate.OLDHAM. &apos;  &apos;-The Federation of Master Cotton 3pinnersr Associations decided last week to recommend that the number of working hours in the Cotton Spinning Mills be increased from 24 hours to 35 hours por week.   This increase of working hours is welcomed by the Operatives, but many people connected with the trade are of opinion that the demand for some time will not be equal to the production of the working hours now fixed.SHEFFIELD.The conclusion of the coal dispute has not yet allowed time to re-establish completely the conditions in the local Iron and Steel Industry, but the position is improving, and some of the heavy Steel and Engineering Works are hoping to resume operations and to work through the Christmas holidays... Goal prices are rapidly coming down,  and this will   have a stimulating effect,  although Coke is still very dear owing to the Coke Furnaces not yet been re-started. A number of Crucible Steel Furnaces remained at work throughout the coal strike in spite of the high fuel costs,   and others are now rapidly getting to work.The lighter branches have in some cases experienced a revival on a small scale. The Cutlery and Flate branches are quiet, and the only department showing activity is that concerned with the cheapest articles, for which the demand is high.    The call for better class goods has steadily declined since the beginning of November.SOUTH OF, SCOTLANDSince the stoppage of the coal strike there has been a distinctly better feeling in the air,  and manufacturers, both in the tweed and hosiery trades, are, on the whole, receiving and anticipating more orders than they were doing during the strike.
GENERAL TRADE  (CONTD.)SWANSEA.The Coal position has not yet got into its stride.   Outputs are increasing &quot;but the position is far from normal.     Consumers are only buying from hand to mouth until prioes are reduced.For the past four months the Tinplate trade has been operating anywhere between 40J? to 50?? of capacity, but this next week will show a considerable improvement, so much so that by the end of the year we expect to work to 70%&apos; to 75% of capacity.Our trouble is that many Countries (such as Germany, France and India) who in the past have been very large consumers of Tinplates, are now making their own plates,  not only for their own consumption, but for export as well.   It will have been noticed from the Press that&quot; we have a big scheme in hand regarding Home Canning,  the idea being to institute mass production on a very large scale of various fruits and vegetables, and to erect neighbouring Canneries to can all the surplus.   By this means, we hope to work up a domestic consumption of Tinplates which in time may make us Independent of our Export Trade altogether.SOUTHAMPTON.There is every indication that local trade will go ahead. The period for overhaul of ocean-going steamers has arrived and according to the provisional arrangements made, will prove an exceptionally busy season for the ship-repairing firms at the port. The &quot;Aqultania&quot; is being dealt with;    and among the other liners to receive special attention is the &quot;Berengaria&quot;, and this will necessitate occupation of the Floating Dock for about a month, whilst the &quot;Empress of Franoe&quot; Is being prepared for a cruise to be undertaken early in the New year.As has been pointed out. in previous reports,  in spite of the difficult industrial situation which has obtained during recent months, very substantial increases in the trade of the port generally have been recorded, as compared with the corresponding period of last year.WALSALL,The Leather Goods Trade generally appears to be in a worse condition that it has been for some time,  and trade will not be helped by the increase in the price of certain classes of leather no doubt this is apparently due to the high price Tanners have had to pay for coal.Tanning &amp; Currying,    This trade has suffered through the cancellation of orders owing to the General Strike, and the prospect for 1927 is difficult to forecast.The Malleable Iron Industry. The, coal Strike has not only completely disorganised the Industries dependent on fuel but it has thrown industries like the Motor Car and the Motor Cycle Trade
CGNPIDi.MTI.-iL .GEN3RAL TRAD 5 (CONTD ) .all out of gear, and it is questionable whether it has not spoilt their trade for 1927;   but there are not lacking indications that some trades will be extremely busy, which of course will re-act on this industry,SIR MAX MUSFRATT sent in the following Report from the Federation of British Industries on 15th December,:-&quot;A spirit of optimism prevails in most industrial .; areas and orders and enquiries are coming forward in nearly all lines of business;    though in the heavy fuel-consuming Industries there is a disposition to await a further fall in the price of fuel before putting plant into full operation. It is unfortunately, however, too early to presume that the above encouraging signs mark the end of all our difficulties and herald a boom in trade.    It is more than likely that the present movement is merely the  -result of the placing of orders and contracts which accumulated during the coal stoppage, and that once they have been worked off British Industry will again have to face the problems of reorganisation and re-orlentation which the trend of world trade development since the war appears to have imposed on it.&quot;GENERAL TRAD 5 AND FINANCE.MR. CURRIE wrote on 13th December -&quot;Up to the present date there are no indications that the termination of the Coal Strike has produced any increased demand for monetary accommodation. It Is unlikely that the full effect of the resumption of work will be felt for some weeks. Meanwhile the release of the War Loan Dividend has produced a temporary ease in the London Money Market and the rate for Treasury Bills has been materially reduced.    Increased monetary stringency may be anticipated in the early     months of 1927&quot;.RAIL&quot;AY TRAFFIC. MR. HURCOMB wrote on 10th December:-&quot;I do not think that any further report can be made about the railway position as yet.    The revival of the railway traffics must follow upon increased activity in the Mines,  in the Iron and Steel Industry, and generally,  and the probable rate of increase cannot be projected separately. It is also not possible to review the actual results of working in 1926 until the railway accounts have been closed&apos;at the end of the ye ar.&quot;
UNEMPLOYMENT..MR. PHILLIPS wrote on 16th December -&quot;The unemployment totals since November 22nd as published have been as follows:.-November 22nd 1,514,733&quot; 29th 1,496,067December   6th 1,506,300These figures are exclusive of mine-workers who though registered were ineligible for benefit owing to the trade dispute disqualification.   The members thus excluded were approximately:-November 22nd 54,000December   6th 138,000The numbers of mine-workers included in the first mentioned totals were approximately:-November 22nd . 98,000December   6th 119,000There was thus a gross addition of about 105,000 to the number of mine-workers, of which addition about 21,000 were included in the published figures.   The balance of 84,000 though not so far held to be eligible for benefit, may become eligible before long, or in some cases may be held to have been eligible from a past date:    the principal question that arises is whether their failure to be reinstated is due to the need for repairs owing to the dispute.    It will be seen that if mine-workers are excluded altogether from the figures, the total fell    by about 29,000 between November 22nd, and December 6th.The above -figures as regards mine-workers should be treated as confidential for the present&quot;.NEW ZEALAND TRADE.SIR JAMES PARR wrote on December 14th:-&quot;There is little doubt that the protracted coal strike has affected economic conditions in New Zealand to a far greater extent than is generally realised.    Apart from the unemployment    of the miners, the shortage   .of coal supplies has, in many cases, necessitated short time working or stoppage, with the consequence that the spending power of large sections of the community In Great Britain has suffered considerably.    Unfortunately, the damage done will take a very long time to repair.    A more hopeful feeling has, no doubt, been brought about by the conclusion of the struggle and, with the gradual return of confidence, it seems likely that the coming year will witness the return to more prosperous conditions.
NEW ZEALAND TRADE.   (CONTD.)As regards New Zealand, it seems probable that the current season will be a record one so far as the production of wool,meat and dairy produce is concerned.Wool.     New Zealand crossbred wool values seeft to have reached a sound basis and there has been a widening csll for these grades, due probably to their relative cheapness.     The home trade has given good support during the series of sales just closed in London, and values have been steady In New Zealand.Unfortunately, many other factors are affecting the wool trade - depreciated currencies abroad, difficulties of finance, etc.  - but it is to be hope-d that we have entered upon a period of small fluctuations in price and a gradual return to more settled conditions.Meat.       lamb and mutton values have for some time been on Che downward grade, but the improvement in the industrial situation is bound to affect the demand, and, with the turn of the year, we can look forward confidently to better conditions.Dairy Produce.     Here again the coal strike has been only one of the factors affecting values of dairy produce, but it has been a big one, and,    ith the return to work of such a large number of the population in Great Britain, demand should undoubtedly improve.       Butter prices have been forced down below economic level, but, just recently, a welcome change has taken place; cold stored stocks have been largely reduced and the prices proved attractive to wholesalers here,  In America, and on the Continent. As a result, quotations have firmed,  and, with arrivals on a moderate scale, it is hoped that this better state of affairs will continue in the New Year.There is very little New Zealand cheese available at the present time, but quotations are higher than the lowest point recently touched, and the outlook is not unsatisfactory.Hemp.     A more hopeful feeling has been brought about in this trade, and greater confidence among manufacturers has permitted them to contract rather more freely for forward delivery.      It Is hoped that the looked for return to more prosperous conditions in this country will be reflected in improved conditions in the principal Continental markets.     New Zealand hemp values have recently been steady, and as it Is relatively cheap compared with competing fibres, it is anticipated demand will improve in the coming year. &quot;
SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.MR. HOSE wrote on 13th December:-&quot;The settlement of the British coal dispute and the withdrawal of the restrictions on exports of the mineral will have considerable effects on trade with South America, although it is as yet too soon to gauge the extent to which the changed conditions will operate.    The impetus given by the coal strike to the use of oil as motive power on the locomotives of the Argentine railways may, of course,  result in a permanently higher percentage of liquid fuel being used, but there is every reason for bolieving that the demand from that quarter for British coal - which for its qualities is preferred over any other -will continue in a large scale.    Since the termination of the coal strike,  a partial decline has already occurred in freight rates from the River Plate - which were nearly doubled during the period of the dispute - in anticipation of vessels having no longer to proceed in ballast to South America to load grain.      The lower freight rates will naturally tend to accelerate the movement from the Plate of wheat,  oats,  and linseed (the new crops of which should normally be coming forward in the early months of the New Year)  and will also lessen the cost of shipping Chilean nitrate of soda to Great Britain.    As oil is almost solely used in the Chilean nitrate industry,  the termination of the strike should not directly affect the demand for coal from that quarter.The first official estimates of the Argentine grain crops for the present season give the yield of wheat at 5,860,000 tons as compared with 5,202,000 tons harvested last season,  and of linseed l,8.fK),000 tons,  against 1,908,000 tons, but in some grain circles the Government estimated are believed to be somewhat optimistic.Since the date of my last report to the Council,  a measure has been proposed by the Government of Brazil to stabilise the exchange value of the currency on the basis of 6d. per milrois.    For this purpose,  it is proposed to create a new monetary unit,  the &quot;cruzeiro&quot;,  equivalent to 4 paper milreis, and having one-tenth the gold content of the   sterling.    The Brazilian Government has,  in the past year or so,  adopted a consistent policy of deflation, but, however laudable these efforts, the policy was apparently pursued somewhat too rapidly for the restriction in the bases of credit and the unsettle-ment in local quotations adversely affected commercial interests, causing heavy failures and bringing about an economic crisis in Sao Paulo and other industrial districts. The recent sharp fall in the rate from about 8d. to 5 15/l66\. has naturally perpetuated the unsettlement.    The earnings of British and other-foreign companies operating in Brazil will, of course, be lessened on remittance to this side to the extent of the decline in exchange,- whilst the service of the foreign debt of Brazil will cost that country more.    On the other hand,  the greatest restriction to overseas trade is exercised by sharp and frequent fluctuations in exchange, and permanent stability,  even at a low rate, would doubtless be of the greatest   benefit to the greatest number.
SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE  (CONTD.)?&apos;ith regard to Chile, vre learn telegraphically that the political situation has greatly improved, and the probability of further difficulties of any importance is remote.    In so far as nitrate of soda is concerned, free selling will undoubtedly be resorted to next season, and it is considered extremely unlikely that the Government will contemplate a reduction in the export duty until the result of these free sales has been &amp;een.   Any official action of this kind to assist in substantial-ly lowering the price of nitrate may therefore be regarded as definitely postponed for the time being.    Meanwhile,  the commercial situation there remains very depressed, but as the present crisis was to a large extent anticipated, no adverse developments of importance are to be expected.    An important new proposal has been put forward by the United States for a settlement of the Tacna-Arica dispute.    The suggestion is that the two Provinces be ceded to Bolivia - thus giving to that country her desired access to the Pacific Coast - in considera-tion of agreed sums to be paid in compensation to Chile and Peru.    According to reports so far received, the proposal Is favourably regarded in Chile and Bolivia, but Press advices from Peru point to opposition from that quarter.    Should Peru, however, adopt a. favourable attitude,  a return of confidence in the general affairs of both Chile and Peru is anticipated.Advices have recently been received, suggesting that Mexico may attempt intervention in political affairs in Nicaragua, where a Liberal Government has been set up - supported by local interests on the Atlantic Coast - in opposition to the Conservative Administration under Senor Diaz, which was a few weeks ago officially recognised by the United States.    Such a move would be in accordance with the apparent Mexican policy of opposition to the predominance of United States interests in Latin American affairs, already somewhat weakened by the abortive attempts, to solve the Arica-Tacna dispute11 .TRADE IN CHINA. MR. LANDALE wrote  on 9th December-&quot;Business in China continues to be very much interefered with by the disturbed, state of the country, and the position is a very difficult one to describe.    in the South some improvement in Canton, Hongkong and Swatow has undoubtedly taken place, but the boycott is still in evidence in some directions.    In Hankow the  extremists have failed in their object    of bringing about a general strike and boycott of British business.    In Shanghai business is described in recent telegrams as &quot;dead&quot;, but in spite cf   that there is a certain amount of import and export business being carried out.There is again a good, deal of movement of troops on the railways and the rolling stock of the Peking-Mukden Railway la reported to be monopolised for this purpose.The result of Mr. Lampson&apos;s visit to Hankow is anxiously awaited, as this may throw some light on the future attitude ( of  the so-called Nationalist Government towards foreign trade&apos; .
