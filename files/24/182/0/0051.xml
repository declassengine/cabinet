relations between the various members of the British Commonwealth of Nations as described in this Reportc&quot;XThe Committee further recommended, that &quot;the general question of Merchant Shipping Legislation bad beat be remitted, to a special Sub-Conference4 which could meet most appropriately at the same time as the expert Committee&quot;$  leet,  that to which reference is made above.    It was suggested that this special Sub-Conforenc3 should be invited to advise on the following general lines&apos;To consider and report on the principles which should govern in the general interest,   the practice and legislation relating to merchant shipping in the various parts of the Empire, having regard to the change in constitutional status and general relations which has occurred since existing laws were enacted.. &apos; Both these recommendations were approved by the Conference.Before the proposed Expert Cciuaittee and Sub-Conf er enc e can get to work,  a good deal of preliminary examination of the problems will be necessary,    It is essential from our point of view that we should ourselves have thoroughly explored the whole ground in advance and it is in the highest degree desirable that the Departments concerned here should have collected all the data which the Cabinet will require when the time comes for them to consider the lines which our representatives should follow.,I propose,  therefore,  for the consideration of my colleagues,  that an Inter-departmental Committee should be set up at an early date to make a preliminary survey of the position with a general instruction to draft and submit,for the approvalX Id*Pel9.

Shipping Legislation, contemplated in the Report of the Inter-Impsrial Relations Committee and that the matoria! so prepared will he circulated in due course; and I would similarly ask the Dominions to circulate la advance any material which they may he preparing,,lie S cAeDominions Office,23rd December, 1926.
