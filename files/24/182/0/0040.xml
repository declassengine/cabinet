S. A.Colonial Office, December 8, 1926.BRITISH INTERESTS IN ARABIA.ARABIA before the war fell into two main, political divisions, viz., the districts, mainly in the north and west, which were subject to Turkey, and the remainder of the peninsula which was governed, in so far as it was governed at all, by independent Arab Sheikhs. As regards Ottoman territory (including the province of the Hedjaz Avith its Holy Places, Mecca and Medina, to which large numbers of Muhammadan British subjects made the pilgrimage every year), British relations, such as they were, were conducted through the normal diplomatic channels. In the rest of Arabia our direct political interests were confined to two localities, viz., (1) Aden and its hinterland; (2) the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman.2. Our interests at Aden, as a British possession and an important fuelling station and naval base on the maritime route to India and the Ear East, need no demonstration. That Aden must be held at all costs, is and was a cardinal article of policy. But the question of the hinterland is more controversial. Ought we to content ourselves with holding just so much of the territory as will secure the Aden settlement from attack? Or do our interests require us to extend our influence over the tribal territory further inland ? That, put shortly, is the point at issue. Before the Avar, the latter view on the whole prevailed. We had been in treaty relations with the tribes in the immediate vicinity of Aden for a very long time past. The earliest treaties date back as far as 1839. Others followed, some of them with tribes further afield, and our zone of influence was extended bit by bit. The process may be said to have continued throughout the last half of the 19th Century and for some years afterwards. The result was (1) the creation of what is now known as the &quot; Aden Protectorate,&quot; and (2) the extension of British influence, of a shadowy kind, over the Hadramaut, i.e.,&apos; the whole coastal area running eastwards from Aden to the borders of the Sultanate of Muscat. The northern boundary of the &quot; Aden Protectorate &quot; was fixed by agreement with the Turks (then its neighbours) in 1905. The Protectorate proper is a strip of coastal territory some 130 miles in length, with an average depth of about 50 miles. The depth is considerably greater in the eastern section of the area (behind Aden itself) than at its western extremity.3. The Persian Gulf littoral has always been a mainly Indian interest, and the necessity of maintaining our predominant influence in that region has for many years been an axiom of British Indian policy. The position was made clear to the world by Lord Lansclowne&apos;s declaration of 1903 (reaffirmed by Sir Edward Grey in 1907) that &quot; we should regard the establishment of a naval base or of a fortified port on the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace to British interests, and that we should certainly resist it with all the means at our disposal.&quot; Prior to the outbreak of the war the position had been regulated so far as concerned the more northerly section of the littoral by a series of protectorate treaties between Great Britain and the local Arab chieftains (Bahrein, Koweit, the Trucial Chiefs, &amp;c), and so far as concerned Muscat which lies further south on the Gulf of Oman by a joint declaration dating back to 1862, under which Great Britain, and France undertook to respect the independence of the local Sultan. ;.[15496] k
4. With the remainder of independent Arabia we had no direct concern. Generally speaking, our interests were confined to the coast and did not extend any distance into the interior. Nevertheless, during the ten years that preceded the war, events were occurring in Central Arabia that were to prove of considerable impor-tance to us. The young Sultan of Nejd, Ibn Sa&apos;ud, started on his career of expansion and conquest in about the year 1903. By 1914 he had considerably extended his frontiers, had begun to overshadow his northern rival, Ibn Rashid of Hail, and had even pushed eastwards as far as the shores of the Persian Gulf, where, in default of the means for expelling him, the Turkish Government gave him the status of Governor of the Ottoman district of El Hasa.5. The War gave an entirely new turn to our Arabian policy. The conquest of Iraq and Palestine (including Trans-Jordan) and the subsequent acceptance of man-datory responsibility in regard to those areas, necessarily brought us into much closer contact with Arabian politics as a whole. Moreover, as part of cur general campaign against the Turks, we entered into new agreements and alliances with various Arab potentates, all designed to hasten the defeat of the common enemy. It was at our instigation that the Sherif of Mecca (later King Hussein) rose against the Turks in 1916 and set up an independent Kingdom in the Hejaz. We also concluded war-time agreements both with Ibn Sa&apos;ud and with Saiyid Idrisi of Asir on the Red Sea Coast, north of Aden. Whether these measures were wise or unwise, whether they served their purpose well or ill, it is useless to discuss. They were essentially war measures dictated by the paramount necessity of defeating the Turk. The complications to which they have subsequently led must be regarded as part of the price of victory.6. Since the war the position has undergone some marked changes. King Hussein has lost his Kingdom and is in exile in Cyprus. Ibn Sa&apos;ud&apos;s power has rapidly increased; he has eliminated his old rival, the Emir of Hail, has swallowed up the whole of the Hejaz, is our immediate neighbour - in Trans-Jordan and Iraq, and is beginning to show an interest in the affairs of the Yemen and Asir. He is beyond doubt the dominant personality of Arabia of to-day. The Idrisi, with whom we made our war-time agreements, has disappeared from the scene. His successor, who was a complete failure, has also disappeared. The present Idrisi is a man of more ability, but his position is insecure and his country is in danger of being-swallowed up by his neighbour and rival, the Imam of the Yemen. The latter, who succeeded the Turks as ruler of the country immediately to the north of the Aden Protectorate, is actually in occupation of a considerable strip of the Protectorate itself. He claims that the whole of the Yemen (right down to the coast, apparently) has formed part of his family domains from time immemorial; that he was not a party to the Anglo-Turkish delimitation of 1905 and cannot be expected to abide by it. He is willing, and perhaps anxious, to come to an agreement with us on all other matters, but on the question of the. occupied territory he show-s no sign of yielding. All attempts to negotiate him out of our territory have so far failed. He is*a man of commanding influence, both political and religious, in his own sphere. He may be said to be, after Ibn Sa&apos;ud, the second outstanding figure in Arabia. Both, it is to be remarked, are religious leaders and at the head of sects (Ibn Sa&apos;ud of the Wahabis and the Imam of the Zeidis) who are regarded by other Muhanimadans as heretical.7. As a general proposition we wish to interfere in Arabian affairs as little as possible. Such interference as may be forced upon us should be confined to the narrowest limits imposed by British interests. What are those interests? Apart from the Gulf littoral, and from strategic interests in the Red Sea, which are dealt with later in this memorandum, they are the well being and security of Iraq, Palestine and Trans-Jordan, and the maintenance of our position at Aden. In the three areas first named we have succeeded, after many difficulties and vicissitudes, in setting up stable administrations and inaugurating conditions of security and prosperity. This is undoubtedly true of Iraq and Palestine. It may fairly be claimed that it is also true of Trans-Jordan, where a very great improvement has been effected during the past two years and where there is every reason to hope that the present favourable conditions will continue. These results achieved with so much difficulty and at such a cost it is clearly desirable to preserve. But provided these essentials can be secured, we may well be content to leave the rival Sheikhs and factions of Arabia to their own devices. The main potential source of danger is undoubtedly Ibn Sa&apos;ud. His power and influence are beyond question and there is no reason to suppose, in spite of his great achievements,&apos; that he has yet reached the limits of his ambition. In Iraq,so far as paper safeguards are of avail, the position vis-a-vis of Ibn Sa&apos;ud has
been safeguarded; the frontier has been fixed and adequate arrangements for dealing with frontier incidents, &amp;c, have been concluded. Palestine does hot march with Ibn Sa&apos;ud&apos;s territory and consequently is not immediately affected. In respect of Trans-Jordan arrangements have been made similar to those in Iraq; but one section of the frontier with the Hejaz (now inIbnSa&apos;ud&apos;s occupation) has yet to be delimited. It may here be remarked that one serious difficulty in relation to Ibn Sa&apos;ud arises out of his inveterate hostility to the ITashimite family, of which the late King of the Hejaz (Hussein) was the head and to which the King of Iraq ancl the Emir of Trans-Jordan both belong. On general grounds we wish to live on good terms with Ibn Sa&apos;ud; but so long as he does not interfere with our pilgrims and refrains from encroaching upon areas for which we are responsible, or embarrassing us in the discharge of our mandatory duties, we want nothing more from him. It is true that we are about to negotiate a new treaty with him; but these negotiations have been undertaken at Ibn Sa&apos;ud&apos;s own request and not on our initiative. It is not known what provisions he will wish to include in it, but the draft which we have prepared on our own account deals with little more than generalities. It contains little of real political substance. It does not ask Ibn Sa&apos;ud to make us any concession or to give us any privileges, commercial or political. Ibn Sa&apos;ud is invited to recognise our &quot; special position &quot; in the Mandated territories and to refrain from aggression against States under our protection (including the Gulf States, in which he has recently shown some disposition to interfere); but that merely means that he is asked to preserve the status quo so far as our interests are concerned.8. The one question likely to create difficulty is that of the undelimited section of the Trans-Jcrdan-Hejaz frontier. The issue turns on the possession of two places, Akaba and Maan. At present they form part of Trans-Jcrdan and are administered by the Emir&apos;s Government. They were in dispute between us and King Hussein while still on his throne in the Hejaz. When his fall became imminent, we took steps to bring them under Trans-Jordan administration and warned Ibn Sa&apos;ud that his advance must stop short of them. Whatever may have been Hussein&apos;s rights, it is difficult to see how Ibn Sa&apos;ud, in the face of our warning, can claim to have inherited them. But he is being pressed in the matter from outside and may prove intransigeant: Akaba is of importance to Trans-Jordan as its one port. If it gGes, Abdullah will have no direct access tc the sea. Ibn Sa&apos;ud, on the other hand, has seaports both in the Persian Gulf and in the Red Sea. Maan, which is on the Hejaz&apos;Railway, must go with Akaba.9. There appears tc be a notion in sonie quarters that we have dealt unfairly or ungenerously with Ibn Sa&apos;ud in the past. Nothing could be further from the truth. We paid him a heavy subsidy during the war and for seme years after, in return for which he rendered us no positive service whatever. When, on the-termination of this subsidy, he set himself to attack cur protege, the King cf the Hejaz, we were content tc stand  iside and let matters take their ccurse. It is true that at the Kcweit Conference of 1923 (when an unsuccessful attempt was made, under our auspices, to settle various outstanding questions between Iraq, Hejaz, Trans-Jordan and Ibn Sa&apos;ud) we made at one stage a suggestion fcr an adjustment of territory which would have involved the cession by Ibn Sa&apos;nd of certain areas under his control. But no pressure was brought upon him to accept this suggestion, and he did not, in fact, accept it. The incident certainly affords no material for a grievance, or for any allegation cf unfair treatment.10. With regard to the Aden region, we have nothing to gain by concerning ourselves with the struggle between the Imam and the Idrisi. Our war-time engagements to the Idrisi are regarded as in pail liquidated, and in any case have been declared by us to be invalid as against other Arab chieftains. Whether Asir remains as an independent Principality or is amalgamated with the Yemen or with the Hejaz, matters little to us. It is true that certain British firms are seeking concessions in both areas; but we have given them no active encouragement and have no intention of shaping our policy in these regions to serve the needs of commerce. No doubt any new market for British goods is desirable in itself; but the resources of the Yemen and Asir (though those of the former are believed to be of potential value) are not considered sufficient to warrant political intervention on commercial grounds. We want nothing from the Idrisi. If the Imam were not encroaching on our Protectorate, we should want nothing from him either. It is always possible that one or other of these Chiefs may unite with Ibn Sa&apos;ud against the other, or that Ibn Sa&apos;ud may turn his own energies against either or both We should not be concerned to intervene in any of these contingencies, provided always that our own position at Aden remained secure.[154961- b 2
11. There are, however, two aspects of the question which we cannot ignore. One is the Imam&apos;s continued encroachment on our Protectorate. The other is the great activity recently displayed by the Italians in this region, and the close relations which they have established with the Imam. As to the first point, the maintenance of the 1905 boundary of the Aden Protectorate is not in itself essential to our interests. Our minimum requirement is a sufficient hinterland to safeguard Aden itself. For that purpose a far smaller area than the existing Protectorate would suffice. But the difficulty of our relations with the Protectorate tribes remains. We are bound by treaty to protect them against external aggression. To a large extent we have failed to do so; but the obligation remains, and we could not formally renounce it (except with the consent of those affected) without serious breach of faith.12. The Italian question raises still greater difficulties. So long as the object of the Italians is commercial penetration, we have no grounds for objection. But we know that they have been arming the Imam, and there is reason to fear that they have encouraged him to invade and occupy the Idrisi&apos;s territory, with a view to establishing themselves there under cover of the Imam&apos;s occupation. There are two localities in this part of the Red Sea, viz., (1) the bay lying between Kamaran Island and the mainland and (2) the Farsan Islands, to which the Admiralty attach the very highest importance on strategic grounds. They would view with the gravest misgiving the occupation of either, but more particularly of Kamaran Bay, by any foreign naval Powrer. They would regard it as a serious menace to our naval communications in the event of war. In addition to their value as naval bases, both Kamaran Island and the Farsan Islands contain landing grounds for aeroplanes. The Air Ministry consider that the occupation of these grounds by a foreign Power, or the establishment of air bases there, would constitute a further menace to Imperial interests. The establishment of a strategic air route along the eastern coast of the Red Sea would also be rendered more difficult. The Imam is already in occupation of the mainland opposite Kamaran, though not of the island itself, and there have been many rumours that he is planning a descent upon the Farsan Islands. Apart from any assistance he may receive from the Italians, he is undoubtedly the stronger of the two. His authority is based on the traditions of centuries, whereas, the Idrisi is a new-comer in Arabia. His country is comparatively fertile and populous. It comprises an upland tract very difficult of access from low-lying coastal district of Asir, which, in its turn, can be attacked without great difficulty from the higher ground. On the other hand, for tribal and climatic reasons, the continued occupation of Asir by Imamic forces would not be easy. Nor is the Idrisi altogether without resources. The recent removal of the embargo on the export of arms to Arabia has enabled him to acquire some much needed ammunition. He seems more likely than his rival to obtain assistance from Ibn Sa&apos;ud. It need not be assumed that further losses of territory on his part are inevitable in the near future.13. Looking at the position as a whole, there appears to be no case for framing an :&apos; Arabian policy &quot; on a grand scale. Even were it desirable in itself, the politics of the peninsula, as experience has shown, are altogether too fluid to admit of any-thing of the kind. For the moment Ibn Sa&apos;ud and his Wahabis are in the ascendant, but their ascendancy may not outlive their leader. Ibn Sa&apos;no is not an old man; but he cannot live for ever, and there is no certainty that his successor will be able to maintain the structure which he has erected. In general, our only safe attitude towards Arabian affairs is to meddle with them as little as possible.14. The better course seems to be to concentrate attention on our immediate desiderata.   These may be summarised as follows :  (1.) A frontier settlement with Ibn Sa&apos;ud which will leave Akaba and Maan to Trans-Jordan;(2.) A settlement with the Imam in respect of the Aden Protectorate; and (3.) The exclusion of the Italians from Kamaran Bay and (if possible) the Farsan Islands.15. It will be well to consider how these desiderata can best be obtained. As to (1), the boundary question will be dealt with as part of the negotiations for a new Treaty with Ibn Sa&apos;ud. Our representative has been instructed to insist on the retention of the present frontier of Trans-Jordan.16. As to (2), we have done our utmost, by negotiation, to induce the Imam to withdraw from our protected territory. It has been made quite clear to him that, failing such evacuation, a. treaty with Great Britain, for which he professes to be
most anxious, is impossible. Yet he adheres to his attitude. It was on this point that his negotiations with Sir Gilbert Clayton (who was sent on a special mission to his capital in January last) ultimately broke down; and it seems clear that further negotiation would prove equally futile. The alternative of expelling him by military action is not considered practicable. It would involve, according to our military advisers, a campaign on a scale which would not be warranted by the objects to be gained. The question has recently been under consideration by the Chiefs of Staff Committee and by the Committee of Imperial Defence. They have recommended a middle course. No campaign is to be undertaken, but the Air Force at Aden is to be strengthened, and the Imam is to be warned that so long as he remains in our Protectorate, and still more if he attempts further encroachments, we shall hold ourselves free to operate against him, iii whatever direction we please from the air. This will probably prevent the Imam from encroaching further, and it may tend to bring him to a more reasonable view of our rights in the Protectorate in general. Sir G. Clayton&apos;s view is that the Imanrs intransigence is due less to his own initiative than to fear of his fanatical advisers; the latter are impervious to argument, but might yield more readily to a show of force. It might be desirable, concurrently with the above step, to adopt Sir Gilbert Clayton&apos;s suggestion that the Resident at Aden should be instructed to undertake a careful review of all our Protectorate treaties and of our past relations with the protected tribes, with a view to determining how far our obligations can be reduced or at least readjusted to suit modern conditions.17. There remains No. (3) of the desiderata stated in paragraph 14 above, viz., the question of naval bases-in the Red Sea, One possible solution of the difficulty would be to give the Idrisi active military or naval assistance in repelling attack by the Imam or in attempting to regain territories from which the latter has ousted him. This course has little to commend it. We do not want to be mixed up in these local disputes. If once we intervened there would be a risk of direct conflict with Italy, which it is obviously most undesirable to incur. It would seem preferable, if the point is really essential to our imperial interests, to make it clear to the world at large (including Italy) that we could not tolerate intrusion by any naval Power at the two vital points. This might be done by means of a declaration similar to that made by Lord Lansdowne in regard to the Persian Gulf in 1903 (see paragraph 3 above). The precise form and language of such a declaration would require careful consideration; but it should be within the resources of diplomacy to frame an announcement which (like Lord Lansdowne&apos;s) would command general acceptance without giving unnecessary offence. The point is worth considering in connection with the instructions to the special envoy whom the Foreign Office propose to send to Rome for the purpose of discussing with the Italian Government the question of our respective interests in this part of the Red Sea.Colonial Office, November 26, 1926.
