[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1926.CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.    30CP. 418 (26;CABINET.THE BOXER INDEMNITY.Memorandum circulated by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.AS my colleagues are aware, the report of the Advisory Committee appointed under &quot;The China Indemnity (Application) Act, 1925,&apos; which has recently been published as Cmd. No. 2766, was based largely on the report of a Delegation of six British and Chinese members, headed by Lord Willingdon, who toured China during the first half of this year in order to gain first-hand knowledge of existing conditions and requirements.The recommendations of the Advisory Committee have in turn given rise to &quot; The China Indemnity (Amendment) Bill, 1926, &quot; which the Cabinet recently decided should not be proceeded with at the present time, imyiew of the facLdhat the whole situation in China is under the consideration of-^iw&amp;TUommittee art &amp;-Ut/r^O-*Before any further decision is taken on the subject of the Bill, I think that my colleagues would wish to read the accompanying despatch from the Governor of Hong Kong containing a critical examination of the Delegation^ report. Sir C. Clementi is doubtless influenced in his attitude by the fact that Hong Kong University was neglected by the Delegation, but when all allowances have been made for the indignation which such neglect might be expected to arouse in the Colony, I must confess that I find his criticisms very damaging.In sum, his representations amount to this : The only real alternatives are to abandon the indemnity altogether or to spend it on institutions for the benefit of China which we control, such as Hong Kong University; all else is eyewash. But if eyewash of this sort is really necessary, why cannot the just requirements of Hong Kong University be satisfied once and for all by an initial lump sum grant, leaving the remainder of the Indemnity to be disposed of by the &apos;Chinese Militarists or extremists as they please ?L. S. A.Downing Street, December 15, 1926.(Secret.) - Government House, Hong Kong,Sir, October 18, 1926.WITH reference to your secret despatch of the 30th August, 1926, and to its enclosures, I have the honour to say that the Report of the British China Indemnity Deputation to the Advisory Committee is a great disappointment to me. I had hoped that the effect of Lord Willingdon&apos;s Deputation would be to smooth the -way to better conditions in China; but I cannot resist the conviction that the Report is calculated to exasperate and prolong the present difficulties and will do nothing to maintain the prestige of Great Britain in China.2. At the outset, I am constrained to protest against that paragraph on page 12 of the Report, in which the Deputation seeks to justify its omission to visit Hong Kong. The impression conveyed by this paragraph is, I submit, that of two quarrel-some neighbours, both of whom are in the wrong. The Deputation, therefore, ignores both Hong Kong and Canton, though it adds as an obvious afterthought (page 63) that the University of Hong Kong, which its members declined to visit, and which the majority of them have never seen, is doing excellent work for the education of the Chinese, and is worthy of every consideration at the hands of a Board whose[15545] b
establishment the Deputation advocates. The Chinese members of the Deputation were reluctant to visit Hong Kong without going to Canton also, and their British colleagues respected this attitude, and thereby doubtless contributed towards unanimity in the Deputation. But it does occur to me that Hong Kong is after all a British Colony, and that the attempt on the part of the Canton Soviet to ruin Hong Kong (admittedly as the first step towards the destruction of British trade, influence and prestige in China generally) by methods which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have since described as those &quot; befitting brigands and pirates,-&apos; was scarcely a circumstance which should have been regarded with indifference by persons, whatever their nationality, who had consented to serve on a British Parliamentary Committee. This Committee was appointed by Act of Parliament to advise the Foreign Secretary as to the purposes on which money due to the British Treasury should be spent, these purposes being required by the said Act to be of mutual interest to His Majesty ancl to the Republic of China. The mischief has already been done and cannot now be undone; but 1 still feel bewildered when I reflect that in the long process of humiliation to which this Colony has recently been subjected, a blow so damaging to its interests was struck by a Deputation of His Majesty&apos;s Government, which decided that, unless its members were allowed to go at the same time to Canton, there to negotiate as friends bringing gifts, with men whose avowed object was the ruin of all things British, not even the compliment of a passing visit could be paid by it to Hong Kong. My bewilderment is only increased when I observe that the Deputation had no hesitation in visiting Marshal Wu P&apos;ei-fu and Marshal Sun Ch&apos;uan-fang, with both of whom the Canton Government is actually at war.3. Turning now to the recommendations which the Report makes, I notice that there is one constructive suggestion and one only. This suggestion is that His Majesty&apos;s Government should by statute hand over the China Indemnity Fund to a Board of Trustees to be created by &quot; the Government of China.&quot; As soon as the Board is organized the Statutory Advisory Committee is to be dissolved; in other words, His Majesty&apos;s Government are, as soon as the Board has been established, to renounce all further responsibility for the spending of the fund, though it is suggested that they should be sent a copy of the Board&apos;s Annual Report. Seeing that by the time the first Annual Report is received (if such a report is ever written) His Majesty&apos;s Government will have handed over the fund to the Board unconditionally, the reports might perhaps be filed b)&apos; ITis Majesty&apos;s Government for perusal by themselves and by Parliament; but the only action which His &quot;Majesty&apos;s Government could presumably take, in the event of a report disclosing a condition of scandal, would be to make a diplomatic protest to the Government of China. There is not at the moment any Government of China; but the present Peking habit, which seems likely to persist, is not to regard diplomatic protests very seriously.4. Eleven members are to constitute the Board of Trustees. Six of these members are to be Chinese and five are to be British; ancl all these members aie to be appointed in the first instance, and in the first instance only, by the Chinese Government. Four members are to be appointed for a term of one year, four for two years and three for three years. Lots are to be drawn at the first meeting of the Board to decide each member&apos;s tenure of office. After the first term the tenure of office of all members is to be for three years. After its first meeting the Board is to be self-propagating, every vacancy being filled up by a vote of not less than seven members. All members are to be eligible for re-election, and the Board is to elect its own Chairman, who may be either Chinese or British. The Chairman shall serve for three years and be eligible for re-election. The proportion of six Chinese and five British is to be maintained up to the beginning of 1945; but during that year the Board is to have power to replace any or all the British members by Chinese members. The Board is to appoint from among its members an Executive Committee of five, of whom two shall be British and three Chinese. The Report puts forward this recommendation absolutely; but it must obviously be read jointly with the recommendation as to the ultimate personnel of the Board. Seeing that after 1945 the Board may be wholly Chinese, it follows that this may be the case with the members of the Executive Committee also. The Report also advises that one condition of membership of the Executive Committee should be residence in China, which suggests that it was the Deputation&apos;s intention that membership of the Board should be open to non-residents in China, This concession would seem to be not without an important bearing on the working of the Board. It would I enable a member to be indefinitely absent from China and, therefore, practically
non-operative, so far as sharing in the Board&quot;s functions is concerned, and yet to continue to be a member of the Board. Even if under such circumstances a member were to resign, it Avould presumably be within the competence of the Board to decline to accept his resignation and thus avoid the obligation of electing another member on the plea that the absent member might return to China and resume his office.5. The Board is only required to meet twice a year, but special meetings may be called by the Chairman on his own initiative or on a written report signed by at least four members. The Board is to have power to make its own Rules and Bye-Laws. The Governments of Great Britain and China are each to have the right to send an observer to attend the meetings of the Board. These observers are apparently not to be allowed to take any part in the proceedings; they are not to be members of the Board, but merely spies on its working. Anyone who has any knowledge whatever of the workings of Oriental politics generally, and of Chinese politics in particular, will realise what an exceedingly dangerous &quot;suggestion this is. It is not unlikely that this recommendation will be bitterly resented by the Chinese, especially in the event of the Board being eventually composed entirely of Chinese members.6. The Board is to have the power to apply the Indemnity Fund to such educational and other purposes, and to make such investments for the perpetuation of the Fund, as it may from time to time determine, in accordance with the general scheme and particulars laid down by the Advisory Committee. The Deputation advises that a sum of  350,000 should be made annually available and that it should be distributed between four main heads of expenditure, viz. :  (a.) Agriculture, 30 per cent.(b.) Scientific research and medicine, 40 per cent.(c.) Other educational purposes and administration, 30 per cent. -The Deputation further suggests that the necessary financial arrangements should be made to raise a sum not exceeding  5,200,000 and not less than  3,500,000 during the years 1927-31 for investment in some constructive work in China beneficial to the people. Proceeds from such investments are to be devoted to the purposes of carrying on in perpetuity, after the complete amortisation of the China Indemnity in 1945, the educational and other work which is to be subsidised, supported or encouraged.7. These recommendations suggest that what the Deputation had in view was that the Chinese Government, in being invited to constitute the proposed Board of Trustees, to which body the Chinese Indemnity is to be made over, should at least be requested, if not instructed, by His Majesty&apos;s Government to impose upon such Board the obligation to proceed in the spending of the money in accordance with principles determined by the Advisory Committee, these principles being in effect put forward as conditions on which His Majesty&apos;s Government might agree to hand over to the Chinese Government the Indemnity Fund. But this was apparently not the intention of the Deputation. For referring to the percentages in accordance with which it was suggested that the annual income should be spent, the Deputation states explicitly that these percentages should be regarded by the Board of Trustees as intended for their general guidance only. The Deputation adds that the Board should not be debarred from transferring a portion of the money available for expenditure under one head to one of the other heads. The Board of Trustees would, in effect, not be going beyond the letter of the Deputation^ Report, if it spent the whole of its income on administration. Then, again, the Deputation advises that the work selected for investments should be railway construction, adding that, of the railway projects brought to its notice, the one which should, in its opinion, be preferred, pi&apos;provided that &quot;political and other difficulties are not found to be insuperable-able, is the completion of the Hankow-Canton Railway. The Deputation advises further, that, if for any cause this Railway project has to be abandoned, the money available for investment should be devoted to conservancy work, and it proceeds to name two such schemes as being most deserving of support. Impartial experts are to be selected before any railway or conservancy scheme is definitely adopted. If the impartial experts submit unfavourable reports, or if the Board of Trustees itself considers that political and other conditions in China are such as to make these undertakings unduly speculative, then the delegates advise that the money to the credit of the Indemnity Fund at the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank should at once be invested in approved stock in China or abroad, and that the sum in excess of the amount which is to be spent annually for the other purposes named ( 350,000) be similarly invested and added to the capital sum with the interest annually accruing. [15545] b 2   .
To this recommendation the delegates add the proviso that, if and when conditions in China so far improve as to justify investment in, or expenditure on, one or some of the projects named, the Board may consider itself at liberty to take the appropriate action. One wonders where to look for an impartial railway expert who, in the conditions now obtaining in China, would care to make a pronouncement that the Hankow-Canton Railway, if and when completed, would be able to earn such returns as to justify its being regarded as a safe investment for Trust funds. But at this point I venture to repeat the recommendation, which I placed before you in my secret despatch of the 20th May, that, as regards the projected completion of the Canton-Hankow Railway, an essential preliminary step is the construction of a junction line at Canton to connect the southern section of that railway with the Kowloon-Canton Railway. The construction of this loop-line, at most only 4J miles long, would at once connect 112 miles of railway from Kowloon to Canton with 140 miles of railway from Canton to Shiu-kwan. It would be an immediate benefit both to this Colony and to the British and Chinese Corporation; and it would make further construction of the Canton-Hankow Railway from Shiu-kwan northwards more economical. This loop-line is of vital importance to the future of Hong Kong, and I earnestly recommend that the small sum necessary for its construction should now be set aside from Boxer Indemnity funds, in order that, so soon as political conditions at Canton permit, the work may be taken in hand, and that instant advantage may be taken of any favourable opportunity which may present itself.8. Turning once more to the Report, I find that, apart from its one constructive suggestion, namely, that the Indemnity Fund should be handed over to a Board of Trustees which His Majesty will not appoint and over which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment will have no control whatsoever; the rest of the Report, except in so far as it is an account of the Deputation^ journeyings in China, merely offers advice which may or may not be accepted. In view of the present condition of China, it was impossible that such recommendations as the Deputation decided to put forward should take any other form. Were the Deputation in the Yangtze Valley at the present moment, its members would find great changes in the political situation since they visited it in April last. But I submit, nevertheless, that tne general condition of China is essentially the same now as it was then, and that a more determined endeavour on the part of the British members of the Deputation to get a grasp of the Chinese situation might have enabled that body to make suggestions of more practical utility. As it is, if the proposed Board of Trustees should be accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Advisory Committee will have either to offer no advice whatsoever (to say, in effect; to the Board : &quot; Here are 11^ millions sterling, do what you like with them &quot;) or to endorse the Deputation^ advice which, by the time the pronouncement is made, may be, and indeed probably will be, even more remote from the reality of circumstances in China than it is at present. But it appears from the authorised statement by the Statutory Committee ancl the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, as quoted by the Deputation from the Peking ancl Tientsin &quot; Times &quot; of the 26th May last, that His Majesty&apos;s Government has already agreed to confer on the proposed Board complete power to apply the Indemnity Fund ancl make investments in accordance with the general scheme and principles to be laid down by the Advisory Committee.9. There is, as I have previously stated, no central Government of China. On the 6th October, 1926, the &quot;North China Daily News&quot; published a leading article entitled &quot; The Vacuum in Peking,&quot; from which I quote the following : &quot;Every Chinese, great ancl small, knows that there is no Government in Peking, therefore that there is no cabinet. The Minister of Finance controls no finances except the revenue which is collected under the supervision of foreigners. The Minister of Communications controls no railways, the militarists having helped themselves to rolling-stocks, roadbeds ancl ticket offices. The Minister of the Interior cannot appoint a single civilian official without first obtaining the consent of some militarist. The Minister of Foreign Affairs now finds all his real functions performed by local commissioners of Foreign Affairs, while he is a sort of radio-broadcaster to tell the world that things are not what they seem ancl are untrue, anyhow, no matter what one may say on the subject. The Premier has no authority at all, while there is no President, Parliament or Constitution.&quot;These statements cannot be controverted, and there is not the slightest sign that this state of affairs is merely transitory. On the contrary, everything at the moment seems to point to greater provincial and local independence.   Marshal Sun Chuan
Fang&apos;s representatives, Dr. V. K. Ting (a member of the Indemnity Deputation) and Dr. Hsu Yuan, recently negotiated the Mixed Court settlement in Shanghai with a committee of local Consuls and without the assistance of Peking. The British Consuls at Chungking and Ichang and the Commissioners of Foreign Affairs at these places seem to be settling the Wan-hsien incident without any interference from Peking. Mr. Eugene Ch&apos;en has called off the Canton boycott without advice or assistance from the acting Premier; and the Canton Government is now asserting its right to levy both &quot; consumption &quot; and &quot; production taxes &quot; on its own citizens, defying at the same time foreign nations &apos;&apos; to raise the bugbear of infringing the integrity of the sacrosanct Maritime Customs.&quot; The Canton Government is asking the Chinese Customs service to co-operate in collecting the proposed taxes, in order to avoid confusion and consequent annoyance to trade; but it adds that it can, of course, create its own entirely independent organ of collection if necessary.10. Apart from the consideration that, &quot;if the Canton scheme succeeds, local tariff autonomy will probably follow in every port of China, which might mean, incidentally, that no more Indemnity contributions would be paid, surely facts of this kind make it doubtful whether the Government of Peking will continue to exist much longer even in name; whether, indeed, the next phase m the Chinese turmoil will not be a general disintegration of the Chinese Republic. This is at least a view wdhch is being more and more widely accepted out here, and ft has penetrated also to the London press. A leading article on China which recently appeared in the &quot; Spectator &quot; contains the following : &apos;&apos; So far as we can see, it grows less and less likely that the great agglomera-tion of races and tongues, of civilizations and distant provinces, which we call China, will ever own one Government again. We cannot even find a cement which would bind together the federation of provinces.&quot;And it is at this juncture that the British Parliament is to be asked to hand over 111 millions sterling, due to the British tax paj-er, to a Board of Trustees which is to be appointed by a Government existing only in name, to a Board, moreover, which is apparently to be accountable to no one, not even to the phantom Government to which it would owe its origin. And this handing over of British funds is to take place at once.11. It is, of course, obvious that the Board, or, at any rate, the Chinese members of it, though it may be nominally appointed by the Chinese Government (if there should happen to be at the moment a Cabinet in Peking), will actually be nominated by the particular War Lord wrho happens at the time to dominate the capital. It is equally obvious that the Board, when once nominated, will be allowed to function only just so long as it carries out the washes of the War Lord in question. It is not very difficult to prophesy what the wishes of such a War Lord with regard to the Indemnity money are likely to be. The conditions being what they are, and what they seem likely to continue to be, it is hard to believe that any Englishman of standing would agree to serve on the Board. It would, even in normal times, be difficult to organize the effective working of a Board which will presumably consist of persons scattered all over China, but which wall have to deal with the investment of large sums of money, to say nothing of the question of grants. I do not say that Englishmen would necessarily object to working under a Chinese Chairman, for the Chairman is practically certain to be a Chinese, on a Board in which they were in a minority, provided that they had confidence in the Chairman and were generally assured that the business of the Board would be honestly and efficiently conducted. But the Chairman is not to be specially selected and appointed by an outside authority, but is to be elected by the Board; and the general conditions, under wdiich the Board will be established and would work, are such as to make any confidence in it impossible. It is, in my opinion, utterly unreasonable to expect Englishmen of standing to allow themselves to be placed in the position which those who allow them-selves to be appointed members of the Board will undoubtedly occupy. But I consider the whole proposal to be fantastic.12. Reverting to the objects on which it is suggested that the funds of the Indemnity should be spent, it is clear that not one of the schemes of which the Deputation has approved can, under existing conditions, be materialized. The money might be assigned, but, were there any attempt to spend it, it would undoubtedly find its way into the pockets of the militarists. One of the Deputation^ suggestions is the establishment of a scientific institute on which, in its opinion, no less a sum than 18 million dollars might be spent with advantage. But this recommendation has been made without any consideration of the work which is
being done, not only in the University of Hong Kong, but also in certain Universities in China, for example, those at Nanking ancl Amoy. Then again, such an Institute, if it is to be anything more than a waste of money ancl an encourage-ment for loafing, must have a well-qualified, capable and energetic staff. Such a staff cannot come from China, for men with the required qualifications and experience scarcely exist as yet. It would not easily be recruited from Great Britain, even if, as seems unlikely, its promoters were willing to appoint British subjects. Its staff might be recruited from, America or from Germany, but is this desirable ?13. In my opinion, however, the greatest objection to the establishment of a permanent Board of Trustees is the fact that it will perpetuate the memory of the whole Boxer episode. Whatever the Board may be called in English, the Chinese will always connect it with the Boxer Rebellion. I submit that it is a gesture of doubtful friendliness to perpetuate a fund the source of which is money payable by China to His Majesty&apos;s Government as compensation on account of British subjects brutally murdered, robbed and outraged by Chinese. When I saw Lord Willingdon in May last, I told him what I felt about this; and I said, and he agreed, that any organization that it might be necessary to create in connection with the Indemnity Fund should be of a purely temporary nature. Possibly the objection which I have just put forward was in the mind of the veteran Chinese statesman referred to on page 15 of the Report as having expressed the view that all the money should be spent as soon as it became available. But this statesman is the only person referred to in the Report whose identity has been withheld.14. I have already pleaded the claims of the University of Flong Kong. The Colony has been, and is still, passing through a severe ordeal; but it has shown remarkable powers of resistance and endurance, and it is a great satisfaction to record that the Hong Kong University has so far passed unscathed through a period marked by violent agitation among Chinese students elsewhere. This University can assuredly do much for the youth of China, and the whole attitude of the University&apos;s students during the last eighteen months has been a striking-testimony to their appreciation of this fact. The Vice-Chancellor and one of the Chinese Lecturers have just paid a visit to the Straits Settlements and the Federated Malay States, and, though they made no public appeal they received spontaneous contributions amounting to 40,000 dollars from the Chinese there resident for the University&apos;s proposed Chinese Faculty. The Deputation admits (see page 83 of the Report) that its instructions were to allocate the Indemnity money for education and other purposes, but to keep education chiefly in view. I maintain, without any fear of serious contradiction, that the Hong Kong University is at the moment the only institution in China for the education of the Chinese, on which the Indemnity money could be spent safely, advantageously, and at once.15. I venture, therefore, to suggest to His Majesty&apos;s Government that in the very difficult position which has arisen the best course would be to make over to the Hong Kong University the total capital sum for which it has asked;, namely,  1,404,000. By the end of this year there will be lying in the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, to the credit of the Indemnity Fund, a sum which, according to the table printed on page 7 in the Deputation^ Report, will amount to  1,686,938 7s. lid.   The sum asked for is, therefore, available.16. In this connection I have to invite attention to the extract from the Deputation^ minutes of the 20th May, 1926, quoted on page 63 of the Report. In this minute the Deputation expresses the opinion that expansion of the Hong Kong-University would sooner or later necessitate its transfer to the mainland, and that it would therefore be a mistake to spend large sums of money on buildings on the present site. I cannot understand how the Deputation arrived at this opinion. None of the Chinese members have ever, to my knowledge, seen the University. Dame Adelaide Anderson and Professor Soothill spent about an hour there on their way through Hong Kong to Shanghai. Lord Willingdon visited the University on three occasions. Not one&apos;of these members of the Deputation ever suggested that there was no room for extension on the present site; nor, so far as I am aware, did anyone connected with the University ever make such a suggestion to any one of them. The idea that the University should be moved to the mainland is entirely impracticable. There is, moreover, ample room for expansion on the present site, especially as it is not contemplated that the University should ever contain more than about 500 students. Additional playing fields cannot be made on the present site, but they can be provided at a reasonable distance.   The argument, therefore, that the University
should not provide itself on its present site with the additional buildings which it requires is entirely without justification.17. It may be objected that to give a large sum of money to the Hong Kong University would be unpopular in China. To this view I do not assent. The politicians and those journalists who are in the pay of the militarists would doubtless complain; but thoughtful Chinese of the better classes, who are not in the least anti-British at heart, would welcome the greater facilities which would be made available for giving their sons and daughters a sound education under conditions of security. It is such men who will count in the long run. The two Chinese members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council, Sir Shouson Chow and the Honourable Dr. R. H. Kotewall, sent, on the 30th March last, to Lord Willingdon, a letter, of which I attach a copy.  The letter concludes as follows: &quot; We accordingly apjoeal with confidence to your Lordship and the other members of the Deputation for your support, and ask you not to be misled by fallacious political arguments into the neglect of an educational institution in which the Chinese have confidence, and which, if it could be provided with adequate funds, would be of incalculable value to the Chinese, not only in Hon? Kong; but throughout China.&quot;18. The Chinese are eminently people of practical common sense, and they respect hard-headed, practical wisdom in others. That His Majesty&apos;s Government should devote a portion of the Indemnity Fund to helping the Hong Kong University to establish itself and to be a centre of British influence in China, they would understand. What they would fail to comprehend is that, while refusing to cancel the Indemnity on the ground that such cancellation might have the disastrous effect of intensifying and prolonging civil strife in China by releasing large sums which would probably be used for warfare, the British Government should go to the trouble of elaborating a complicated and costly scheme, the effect of which would, in all probability, be that such money as is not spent on administration will find its way into the pockets of those same militarists whose activities are so loudly deplored.I have, &amp;c.C. CLEMENTI,The Right Hon. Governor, &amp;c.Lieutenant-Colonel L. C. M. S. Amery, M.P.,&amp;C, &amp;C.,&apos; &amp;c.Enclosure.Right Hon. Viscount Willingdon, G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., G.B.E.. c/o British Consulate-General, Shanghai.My Lord, Hong Kong, March 30, 1926.HIS Excellency the Chancellor has already, we understand, sent forward for the consideration of your Lordship and the other members of the Boxer Indemnity Deputation a detailed scheme for the development and expansion of the University of Hong Kong. A pamphlet written by the Vice-Chancellor on the origin and growth of the University is also, we believe, in your Lordship&apos;s hands. We are members of the Court and the Council of the University, as also the two repre-sentatives of the Chinese Community on the Hong Kong Legislative Council. We know the feelings and wishes not only of the Chinese community of the Colony of Hong Kong, but also of the more conservative elements of the Chinese people generally. It is on this basis that we venture to approach your Lordship to express our appreciation of what the University has done, and our confidence that the strong claim of the University to share in any educational benefits to China which His Majesty&apos;s Government may decide to finance out of the Boxer Indemnity will not be overlooked.2. We desire to emphasise at the outset that the founders of this University always insisted that the University was not for the Colony of Hong Kong alone, but for the Chinese people generally. It was on this understanding that the University secured supporters from Chinese throughout China, among the most enthusiastic of whom was the then &quot;Viceroy of Canton, his Excellency Chan Jen Chun.3. Owing to financial and other internal difficulties and the unsettled condition of China which followed on the great European war, the University has experienced some set-backs. But it has educated students from all over China, many of whom arc now- doing well; and it is perhaps not irrelevant to remind your Lordship in
this connection of what his Excellency the Chancellor has already brought to your notice, namely, that on account of scholars sent to the University, the Peking Government and other governments of China are still in the University&apos;s debt to the extent of over one hundred thousand Hong Kong dollars.4. Among the proposals in connection with which his Excellency the Chancellor has approached your Lordship is a scheme for establishing in the University of Hong Kong a Faculty of Chinese studies. His Excellency deprecates the comparative neglect with which Chinese studies have hitherto been treated in the University, and is emphatic in his view that this defect should be made good as soon as possible. With this view we are in complete agreement. The scheme for a Chinese Faculty, which is now being laid before your Lordship, will not only provide facilities for the study of Chinese classics by Chinese students ancl for the corn-par ative study by such students of the English and Chinese languages, but it will also be designed to afford opportunities for Britishers, both civil servants and commercial men, to acquire the Chinese language.5. When the Universitj^ of Hong Kong was started, stress was laid on the undesirability of sending immature Chinese boys far away from their homes and traditions and customs of their country to be educated in Europe and America. The Canton Viceroy, quoted above, was particularly emphatic regarding this danger. We desire to impress upon your Lordship and your colleagues that this danger, far from having ceased, is now more acute than ever.6. Indiscipline is now too common among students throughout China. From all quarters comes the same complaint that students have become a law to themselves, and that they insist on choosing their own teachers, their own studies, the hours that they shall work, and the sort of examinations they shall take. Above all, some students meddle in politics. We need scarcely remind your Lordship that such actions and ideas are subversive to all that the Chinese venerate. Fortunately, cur University has shown itself immune from such troubles, and we feel that it is a proper corrective for these errors of training. Amid all the troubles which have beset Hong Kong in the last nine months the conduct and discipline of the students in the University has been admirable. The atmosphere which prevails in the University is one in which the student, within the strict limits of reasonable rides which he must obey, enjoys almost complete liberty; it is an atmosphere from which graduates can safely and profitably pass into higher studies elsewhere. We are glad to hear that among the proposals which have been laid before your Lordship is a scheme of post-graduate scholarships, tenable by ex-students of the Kong Kong-University in Great. Britain.7. Medical degrees of the Hong Kong University are recognised by the General Medical Council of Great Britain as a qualification for registration. Honours&apos; in the Engineering Faculty are only awarded on the assessment of a Professor of Engineering of the University of London. Indeed, the standards of the Hong Kong University generally are recognised as equivalent to the standards which prevail in British Universities. This is a very great advantage to the Chinese students, and it would, we submit, be deplorable if the present financial difficulties of the Colony should lead to the deterioration of the University&apos;s work.8. The University of Kong Kong has received generous support in the past from the Chinese of the Colony; but so large an undertaking, which was designed to serve not only Hong Kong but also of the whole of China, cannot be entirely maintained by the inhabitants of the Colony by reason of the smallness of their numbers. It is therefore but reasonable and fair that the University should receive some substantial support from China and the Imperial Government. The allocation of a portion of the Boxer Indemnity to the University would fulfil both these conditions, since the money is derived from Chinese sources, and will also represent an Imperial contribution. We accordingly appeal with confidence to your Lordship and the other members of the Deputation for your support, and ask you not to be misled by fallacious political arguments into the neglect of an educational institution in which the Chinese have confidence, and which, if it could be provided with adequate funds, would be of incalculable value to the Chinese, not only in Hong Kong but throughout China.We are, My Lord,Your most obedient servants, (Signed) CHOW SHOU-SON.R. H. KOTEWALL.o
