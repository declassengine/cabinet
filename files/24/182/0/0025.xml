DOCUMENT IS TUB PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) .  C R E T. P. 400(26) ,CABINET.POSSIBLE REDUCTION OF THE BRITISH ARMY OF OCCUPATION IN THB^-INSLAND.Copy of letter from the Treasury to the Foreign Office.(Circulated by direction of the Chancellor of the Exchequer with reference to Cabinet 61(26), Conclusion 3).Treasury Chambers, S.W.1. 30th&quot;September, 1926.Sir,1.      I am directed by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury to refer to the correspondence between your Depart-ment and the 7/ar Office ending with the Foreign Office letter of the 8th instant,   (C,9472/446/18), relative  to the question of a possible reduction of the British Army of Occupation In the Rhineland.2.      My Lords desire to draw attention to the fact that though the figures in the War Office letter doubtless represent the effect of a withdrawal of the British forces on Army Estimates taken in isolation,  they do not show the effect on the Exchequer as a whole and therefore on the tax-P&apos;Siyers of this  country.      If it were possible to assume that all Armies of Occupation were entirely withdrawn,  though Army Estimates would lose the contribution the?^ now receive, the Exchequer as a whole would benefit, because the prior charge of  8 millions for Army Costs would cease and an equivalent sum become available for Reparation payments  of which thisCOPY HO.    v5 O
country receives a bigger proportion than it does of the allocation for Army costs.Similar results would follow pro tanto from an all round reduction pari passu in the three Armies of Occupation below the basis strengths referred to in the Financial Agree-ment of 11th March 1922..3.     On the other hand, as the reduction of the British forces hitherto has been proportionately far greater than that of the French Army, a further reduction now of both Armies pari passu, before the French strength has been brought into line with the existing state of the British forces, would have financial results seriously detrimental to this country. &apos;4.     The costs of the Armies of Occupation deducted as prior charge under the Paris Agreement are . Percentage.Fran ce      5,500 , 000 68.75U.K. 1,250,000 15.625Belgium    1,250,000 15.625 8,000,000 100._whereas if that sum were available for distribution onreparation account, the distribution would be c-France  4,360,000 54^%British)Empire  )       1,840,000 23$ (of which U.K.about 20?* * 1,600,000) .Belgium  360,000 3-1*Other )Powers)         1,440,000 19 8.000,000 100,It will be seen that the present proportions of distribution of Army Costs give His Majesty&apos;s Government substantially less than the proportion they wotild receive if the amounts applied to Army costs were distributed as reparations.     These proportions were fixed by the Finance
Ministers at the Paris Conference in January 1925 on the&apos; basis of the respective effectives of the different armies at that date and in view of the reductions made in the British strength, His Majesty&apos;s Government found it impossible to obtain the proportion (approximately 20.-) to which they regarded themselves as entitled on the basis of the original agreement of March 1922a     From the financial point of view, My Lords consider it important that the proportion obtained in January 1925 should not be further reduced,  as It would undoubtedly be if the effectives of the British Army were further reduced before the French strength has been brought into line with the reduction already made in the British forces:    and Their efforts have been directed to securing a readjustment of the distribution, taking account of the reduction now effected by the French and Belgian Armies, so as to restore the proportions to those fixed in 1922.5o     The financial effect to this country of various alternative propositions may be set out as follows(I) In the event of the total withdrawal of all Armies of Occupation, the whole of the prior charge would be available as reparations and the result to this country would be  : -Gain:20&apos;t of  8 millions1,600,000Loss :allocation for British Army costs B1,250,000Net Gain350,000AddSaving on gross Army Votes (paragraph 7 of War Office letter of the 26th August).350,000 700,000
There  ??ould also be certain gains in this case to the Dominions and to the Allied Powers not concerned in the Occupation,  especially Italy,  and these countries are therefore Interested in securing a withdrawal of the Armies.(2) If, on the other hand,  the British Army were reduced to 5,000,  and the present strengths of theFrench and Belgians remained unaltered,  the financialresult to this country would be :-Loss: Reduction of army allocation of   1-j- millions in theproportion 5,000   : 8,000 470,000(ice. to  780,000)Gain; 20% of  470,000distributed as reparations 94,000Net Loss      ... 376,000Deduct:      savings to grossArmy Votes  (say) . . , 125,000Total net loss  .. _251,000The reduction in the British Army alone would therefore result in a net loss to the British Exchequer of about  250,000,  whereas the complete withdrawal of the Armies would produce a net gain of about  700,000,(3) The financial effect of a reduction of all the Armies to one-third of the standard effectives fixed in 1922  (i.e. French to 32,000.    Belgian to 6,400:    British to 5,000)  cannot be precisely estimated as  it would depend on the extent of the consequential reduction in the allocations to the various Armies, but assuming that the allocations were reduced strictly in proportion to the reductions in effectives,   (which would not necessarily be the case) the benefit to the British Exchequer would be comparable to the benefit shown above for complete withdrawal.
6.      It may be added that a revision of the allocations for Army costs Is now being discussed in Paris and it is anticipated that an agreement may be reached fixing them, as from the 1st April last, at the following amounts:-France  5,000,000Great Britain        1,250,000Belgium     750,000Despite the roductions made in the French strength the French Government have shown the strongest objectio-n to reductin,&apos; their allocation below the figure of  5 millions (in place of the previous  allocation of  5,500,000) and so long as they maintain this attitude, My Lords have felt bound to resist any reduction in the present British allocation of  1,250,000,7o      These negotiations have confirmed Their Lordships in the view maintained by Them during the past few yeax^s that it is important from the financial point of view that the British Army on the Rhine,  which has already been reduced from 15,000 to some 8,00 0, should not be further reduced until the French and Belgian Armies have effected reductions In the standard effectives fixed by the Finance Ministers Agreement of March 1922, proportionate to those already effected by His Majesty&apos;s Government..      It will be observed that this would Imply that no further reductions should be made in the strength of the British Army unless and to the extent that the French Army is reduced below 51,000 (the equivalent proportion to the British actual strength of 8,000), whereas it appears that it is the present intention of the French Government&apos; to maintain an Army of  5,000,A copy of this letter has been sent to the War Office.I am,  Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Sd.)   O.E.  NIE MEYER.-5-.&apos;
