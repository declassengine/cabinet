q pt g (p. Copy No.   170.i/i37/39^Ws DGcumsnt is the Property ofi4.i2.l7,.l5yA&apos;^        &quot;his gHtannfc !V1alestY&apos;s Government)Secretary;&quot;tyQ/   War Cabinet.lf 1,   In the Proceedings of the Meeting of the War Cabineton Wednesday, December 12th 1917, it is stated &quot;that our Intelligence Service in regard to Turkey was very defective and compared unfavourably with our Intelligence arrangements on the Western front.   For instance, when General Allenby had been asked how many men would be required, in his opinion, to capture&apos; Jerusalem and hold it, he had replied that the Turks could bring against him 18 divisions in addition to 2 German divisions that were available.   General Allenby had estimated that 20 British divisions (500,000 men) would be required to take Jerusalem.    What had finally happened was that only 20,000 Turkish rifles had opposed our 100,000 rifles.   In addition, the Turkish transport had completely broken down; there was no coal for the railways, and there was no horses and no mules to enable the Turks to get their . guns away.&quot;As the War Cabinet would no doubt wish to receive an explanation of the above alleged failure on the part of the Intelligence Branch I forward the following observations,2.    It will be remembered that on the 5th October, 1917,the War Cabinet Policy Committee requested the General Staffto consider the force required to ensure the occupation ofthe Jaffa-Jerusalem line, and also requested that GeneralAllenby&apos;s opinion should be obtained upon the same subject-.General Allenby&apos;,s Instructions at the time, as approved bythe War Cabinet, read thus&quot;It is not possible now to assign any geographical ob-jective to you, and therefore It will be your object to defeat the Turks opposed to you and to follow up your success as the situation allows.    It ie important that you. should press the Turks opposed to you to the fullest extent of your resources available as early in September as possible, so as to relieve pressure upon Maude by: forcing the enemy to direct troops to Palestine and to take advantage of the Arab situation&quot;.It
It will be observed that there is a wide--difi^erence between these instructions and the new project the General Staff were directed to examine,.   In the first case General Allenby was left free to fight as and where he chose, provided that he inflicted a local defeat and kept up the necessary pressure, and he could call a halt at any time when he felt that his resources were becoming exhausted.   In the second case he was definitely expected to occupy, and of course hold, the Jaffa-Jerusalem line, which means that he must make certain of overthrowing all opposition encountered and persistently continue his operations until he occupied both Jaffa and Jerusalemo   This obvious difference had a great influence on the General Staff in preparing their proposals, as no doubt It had on General Allenby in estimating his requirements e25/3 59.       3*     The General Staff &apos;s views were submitted to the War/391.   Cabinet on the 9th October before tho arrival of General Allenby&apos;s ,17.views but it is clear from tho latter that both tho General Staff and General Allenby approached the problem from the same stand-point; that Is to say, credit was given to the enemy for acting in the manner best suited to his Interests,    It was assumed that ho would be careful not to allow his exposed flanks to be turned and would stand on the successive lines of defence which he was known to have prepared between Gaza and Jerusalem.   The General Staff estimated that we should have to be prepared to fight three battles before the capture of Jerusalem, and they also calculated that in order to replace divisions which would become exhausted in the fighting a reinforcement of three divisions would be necessary,, making ten in all.. At the same time they stated that &quot;if the enemy stands on the Gaza position and is given a severe blow, he may collapse in the same way as the Turkish forces did at Kut, and General Allenby&apos;s fine body of mounted troops may be able to follow him up and prevent him rallying to the South of Jerusalem. This is, however, altogether too problematical to be relied upon In preparing a plan of campaign&quot;0
4.     Nothing that has occurred has shown the General Staff to have been wrong.     The enemy did, in fact, endeavour to avoid the turning of his left flank and to stand on the successive lines which he had prepared and he was prevented from doing so only by the success which attended General Allenby1s movements round Beersheba.     The success of this movement, however, depended upon the wells of Beersheba being undamaged, and upon their containing sufficient water to enable our troops to continue the pursuit. The wells were found to be undamaged and just sufficient water was made available, but the margin was so slight that some of the men on this flank had to live for 48 hours on a single^water-bottle of water apiece.     No General Staff and no General would have been justified in basing a plan of campaign upon chances of this nature. Had they done so, and had the campaign failed, they would have been jo.s t ly c ondermie d.5.     The question of what forces the Turks could bring Into the field was largely governed by the rate of General Allenby&apos;s ad-vance.     Had the turning movement failed, and we could not possibly have guaranteed its success, a slow advance against a series of defensive positions would have become necessary.     In this case General Allenby might not have reached Jerusalem before the end of January and the Turks would have had ample time to bring up fresh Divisions to replace exhausted troops at the front in the manner indicated by the General Staff.     These Divisions were available to bring up the total to the 20 Divisions mentioned by General Allenby. Genera]. Allenby added, however, that supply arrangements would probably prevent the enemy from maintaining more than 12 of these Divisions on his front at any one time, and up to the present, despite the rapidity of his advance, he has been opposed by 11 Turkish Infantry Divisions and one Cavalry Division, while one other Division, which may be a German or a Turkish Division, Is howalmost
eJ 1 0almost certainly South of Damascus.   He did not give in his telegram any estimate of,the enemy&apos;s total or rifle strength, and therefore in this respect his Intelligence Department can hardly he said to have failed.6.    The General Staff estimated the enemy&apos;s combatant strength south of - Jerusalem in October at -52,000, with two more Divisions within four or five days&apos; call of the fighting front,  a total combatant strength of 67,000.    The two Divisions referred to did actually reach the front, and the total combatant strength of the forces turns out.to have been 58,000 at the battle of Gaza-Beersheba.    The enemy&apos;s combatant strength at the time of the capture of Jerusalem was 39,000, (the difference being due to his losses in the battle and in the pursuit) and his then rifle strength was 21,000.    It is, therefore not the fact that &quot;only 20,000 rifles had opposed our 100,000&quot;, since his rifle strength at Gaza-Beersheba would be about 4b,000.7.     As regards General Allenby&apos;s estimate that he himself would require 20 divisions, it is to be noted that the estimate was based on a possibly slow advance Ydth much fight-ing, and that 6 of the 20 were to be &quot;concentrated on Canal for purposes of replacing worn out Divisions&quot;, and for holding the front for an indefinite period,  including the hot weather. The General Staff estimate of the force required for a deliberate advance on Jerusalem was 10 divisions plus 2 divisions for subsequent reliefs.8.     I may add that both the War Office and General Allenby had endeavoured to make every possible preparation to ensure the success of the operations and to meet, if possible, the wish of the War Cabinet in the capture of Jerusalem and I venture to think that had this not beendone
done General Allenby would not now be In Jerusalem. The most important of these preparations was that of the extension of the railway line to Jaffa.    The labour and material for this had been prepared before the battle of Gaza-Beersheba began, and the line is no?/ being laid,9,     I think that the above explanation will be regarded as satisfactory,(Signed)   W.R. Robertson,C. I. G k S.War Office, 14,12.17.
