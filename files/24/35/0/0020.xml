crbt.T7AR   CABINET. FOOD PRODUCTION BY THE ARMY IN FRANCE.tfORANDUK BY THE 3?KB 3IDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AHDTHE DIRECTOR GENERAL 01 FOOD PRODUCTION,7e circulate the following as a supplement to our Memorandum on Food Production, England and Wales (G.T. 2767):-The general shortage of food supplies, the strain on transport in carrying food from overseas, and the vital importance of fresh vegetables to the health of the Armies in the Flold, -make it highly desirable that means should be taken to increase as far as possible Food Production in the areas occupied by the British Army in France.As the result of a preliminary investigation of the subject by the Food Production Department, it has been ascertained that plenty of land in good heart and free from impediment to cultivation, is available in the sone of the Ai-mies,   In the area occupied by one Army alone, there are perhaps 100,000 ao::es of land, now cleared of its civilian population and practically derelict, but capable of producing good cropsc   Much of this land is situated near existing railway lines and main roads, both of which lead back to convenient distributing centres.   Given average cultivation and normal average yields, it is estimated that ten &quot;farm gardens&quot;, each of 5^000 acres, should suffice to produce enough vegetable food to supply upwards of 1,000,000 men. The total weight of this produce &quot;?ould be&apos; from 400,000 to 500,000 tons, much of which is no^ imported either from this country or from overseas.   The saving of tonnage which would result from growing this food in France would alone justify the small expenditure of money and man-power (principally prisoners or Chinese labour), which would be involved.A detailed scheme, applicable to existing conditions in the zone of the Armies, has already been prepared by the Food Production Department, and^he approval of the general principle involved is sought from the Cabinet.The time available for setting up the necessary organisation is very short, but should suffioe if reasonable facilities are sanctioned by the Commander-in-Chief in France. As a   first step, it is suggested that the Director of Horticulture, Food Production Department, should be instructed to proceed to General Headquarters to discuss the whole question with the Military Authorities on the spot.R. e. PROTKERO. A. lee.December 7th, 1917.
