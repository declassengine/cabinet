Opqy of Memorandum by Li out. G.. Ventimigliadated Italian Aviation ServiooT&quot;&quot;Translation. Ho.4994.ITALIAN EMBASSY, Urgent.   . LONDON.&quot;(228089)November 27th, 1917.Sir,The Chief of the Aviation Department of the Italian tiilitary mission has addressed to Brigadier-Gdnoral Mola, Italian Military Attache&apos; and head of the Mission, the letter and manorsndum of which translations are enclosed to enable the matter to be dealt with more promptly.The two documents describe tho reesons why the Air Board and the iior Office first postponed and then refused delivery of certain important armament materials, duly arranged for with the Italian Administration last July; - and invoke the inter- -vsntion of the Italian Embassy to ask oho British Government for an early settlement of the matter end the grant of various important materials ordered.In addition to tho reasons set forth by the head of the Aviation Department the Italian Military Attache for his part lays most serious emphasis on the urgent need for these supplies, urging me very strongly to drew Your Excellency&apos;s kind attention to the pressing need of obtaining the different applications.For all these reasons I have therefore the honour to have recourse to Your Excellency&apos;s habitual great courtesy to ask you to be good enough to support with the competent Authorities, and especially with the War&quot;Cabinet, on the grounds fully explained in the two accompanying documents, the application
for supplying without delay to the &apos;Its.lien Aviation Department..(1) At least 350 Viewers i&amp;chire Guns in tho month of December next;   and of arranging for monthly deliveries after&apos; that date to the Department of 150 Machine Guns of the same type up to the balance of 1200 VicKers Machine Guns originally ordered.(2) An increase of 4,800,ooo rounds over tho quantity of ammunition formerly assignee during the present war for the service of those Macbino Guns.(3) St least 1,20u,joO &quot;disintegrating lines&quot;.(4) tho early delivery of the 2-jO tons of the &quot;trotyl&quot; already agreed to and a further supply of-another  uu tons of trotyl already applied for:(5) delivery of the two tons of refined white Phosphorus also previously applied for .-In thanking Your Excellency in advance for the action which you may he ,-.&apos;;ood enough, to take to secure the early grant of these materials so necessary for the efficiency of the Italian aviation Service.I have &amp;c.-, (Signed)     IMPERIALI.Sir,He:-    Viekers machine Guns end Ammunition.-I beg to acquaint you as follows on the subject of dealings for Machine Guns and ammunition for the Italian Aviation Sorvico,During last July this Department, had-&apos;, as you are already aware j.. an exchange agreement with the.-. British &quot;Air Board for the :;upoly of 450 FIAT aero-engines, type &quot;A-12&quot;; 200 HiP- (of which 300 a:ere to be - complete engines and 150 in spare parts) j to be allocated by the Italian Government in exchange for 1,200 VICZ3K3 Machine Guns 303 bore, of which the -ir Board agreed to deliver 1,000 within May 1918.The requirement of amuranition and explosives was as follows: -1.500,000 rounds for Lewis Guns already in Italy,12,600,000 rounds for the 1,200 Vickers Guns,- .400,000 Disintegrating Minks,400 tons of Trotyl  tons of Refined &quot;.hite Phosphorus.Those applications now stand as per enclosure iio, 1 attached, from which it- will be possible for you to detract more precise information.
You are, no doubt, well aware of the length/ procedure snd difficult dealings that have been gone through, and this matter was mentioned on the occasion of the recent visit of Captain Theodoli, i-^P,, who was permitted fcy yourself to write direct to Lord Derby on the subject, without, however, obtaining any definite result.The air iioard has even disclaimed responsibility of the agreement signed by Mr, Turner, Director of Aeronautical Contracts, stating that no correspondence had any value unless signed by &quot;the Secretary of the Air Board,The ii&amp;r Office, on its )art, although declaring itself ready to facilitate the allocation of Guns and Ammunition to the Italian Aviation Service, confirmed its incapacity to take into consideration any application which had not previously been supported by the Air Board, stating that tho Air Board, instead of stipulating car requirements as 1,200   Viewers Cans, had only applied for 200, this quantity being only up to the present augmented to 250, which have only now been deliverer&quot; instead of last august.This Department has tried its utmost to raa-xe the Air Board and the war Office realise the Very serious situation, but has never been successful in obtaining a clear definition, it not even ceing possible to arrange a simultaneous conference between tho Air aoard, the Mar Office, and this Department,Respecting Amm unit ion and the necessary accessories, such as Disintegrating- Metal Bands, notwithstanding the arrangements made at the ministry of munitions, the Air Board and the war Office are, and always have been, delaying supplies.In spite of the actual circumstances, and exceptional gravity of the situation at the Italian Front, when General C add ell, DaA*Do- to the Air Board, recently kindly placed at our disposal about fifty - and oossibly more - of those Viekers Machine Guns, which he declared were available, together with complete accessories and a month1s supply of Ammunition,  the Air Board again stated that it was unable to cope with same, and the aar Office stopped even this supply-     Thus we were obliged to lose another occasion which would have been greatly beneficial and propitious.TIP-3 Italian Aviation Department, which, rcotvvithstanding the great difficulties experienced, still endeavours to go ahead and tried its very best to overcome any difficulties day by day., especially as regards the important allocation of materials, was under the impression that it would bo able to avoid making the afore-mentioned, remarks, in the hope that the Air Board End the 17ar Office would have realised the actual situation, and would in consequence have urgently assisted us in this question.In consideration of the above, arc with regard to tho allocation made by France of two hundred machines (Spad. Eanriot and Newport), which must be armed, we shot:id still obtain within Docember 1917 at least another 250 Vickers machine Guns as follows150 for our own machines in Italy,3UO for the machines allocated by Iranee.From January 1918, our requirements are of one hundred and fifty/Vickera Guns per month and the &quot;or Office could allocate this /quantity to us, because I understand that the production of these machine Guns is constantly increasing.
I cannot forego this opportunity to express to you all the thanks that are due to Colonel Phillips, Head of the viation Section of the C.I.R., and to Sir Edmund Wyldbore Smith himself for the roady support which the C.I.R. have recently given to this Department, motvithstanding the numerous obstacles which re have found with the other Departments. 

The Director of the Commission Internationale de Ravitallement has been requested personally by H.E. Baron Mayor des Planches to look into the matter, and he is doing all within his power at present, but I am afraid his efforts will not be very successful.

The matter, therefore, can only be put forward diplomatically, and I would venture to suggest to you, Sir, to approach H.E. the Ambassador Marquis Imperiali, with a view to having the question put forward through the Foreign Office.

I am, &amp;c.,

Re: AlflfiDNltiOlf FOR THE ITALIAN AVIATION SERVICE&quot;.As supplementary information to my letter of even date, reference Ho. 3590,  about diplomatic representation to be made to the War Cabinet,  and for which you have so kindly interested yourself, I beg to add the following details which I think it necessary you should know, in order to be quite conversant with all the facts, especially the recent ones.The ammunition applied for amounts to 1.4.100.000. rounds, divided as per enclosure 1 of my above-mentioned letter,  and what should have been supplied within December 1917 would have been as follows; -1,500,000 rounds for Lewis Gun1?.6,500,000 rounds for 600 Vickers Guns,Total       7,800,000 roundsDp to the preBent only 3,000.000 rounds have been sanctioned,  of which 900,000 are ordinary ammunition of low quality, called Green Cross, instead of the special selected quality required for Aviation purposes.It appears impossible to obtain Armour Piercing Ammuni-tion; however, Colonel Todhunter at the Ministry of Munitions promised to supply us with a certain quantity of A.P. ammuni tion, which could not be issued to British Service owing, to pressure being slightly in excess of that for the British Rifle though quite safe for Machine Guns use.The Disintegrating Metal Bands, which have so ofar not even been parti ally - sanctioned,  are also very urgent,  for without these Links it is quite impossible to efficiently employ the Vickers Machine Guns.   We require 1,200, 000 Links within December,For the Trotyl, this matter is now being dealt with by Major Stomm of the. C..I.R. as the Air Beard have delayed this matter so long, whilst it was not within their province and had instead to be put forward to the Ministry of* Munitions.I am sure that this question will have a favourable result, as the Mini&amp;ry of Munitions have already stated tnat they have no difficulty in this matter.The same may be said for the White Refined.Phosphorus.(Signed)    G. VENTIKIGLIA. Lieut.
