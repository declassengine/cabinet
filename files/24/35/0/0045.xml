/StTHE enclosed is a copy of the telegram despatched, as the result of the Paris Conference on Inter-allied Munitions, by the representatives of the American Mission, with the concurrence of Generals Pershing, Bliss, and Williams, and with the approval of Colonel House, to the United States Government. If it is accepted by that Government as a basis of action, it will constitute a very important advance towards the realisation of our full war power.The scheme was devised by General Furse, Sir Glynn West, Sir James Stevenson, and Mr. Lay ton.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.
[fMs DoQEment is the Progsrty of SiBBntagmg Majesty&apos;s GoYejenmsak]Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1917.SECRET.ALLIED MUNITIONS.THE representatives of Great Britain and France state that their production of artillery (field, medium, and heavy) is now established on so large a scale that they are able to equip completely all American divisions as they arrive in France during the, year 1918 with the best marks of British and French guns and howitzers. The British and French ammunition supply and reserves are sufficient to provide the requirements of the American army thus equipped at least up to June 1918, provided that the existing 6-inch shell plants in the United States and Canada are maintained in full activity, and provided that the manufacture of 6-inch howitzer carriages in the United States is to some extent developed. On the other hand, the French (and to a lesser extent the British) require as. soon as possible large supplies of propellants and high explosive, and the British require the largest possible production of 6-inch shells from now onwards, and of 8-inch and 9&quot;2-inch shells from June onwards. In both of these matters they ask the assistance of the Americans. With a view, therefore, first, to expediting and facilitating the equipment of the American armies in France, and, second, to securing the maximum ultimate development of the ammunition supply with the minimum strain upon available tonnage, the representatives of Great Britain and France propose that the Americans&apos; field, medium, and heavy artillery be supplied during 1918, and as long after as may be found convenient, from British and French gun factories ; and thev ask (a.) That the American effort shall be immediately directed to the production of propellant and high explosives on the largest possible scale ; and(/;.) Great Britain also asks that the 6-inch, 8-inch, and 9*2-inch shell plants already created for the British service in the United States shall he maintained in the highest activity, and that large additional plant for the manufacture of these shells shall at once be laid down.In this way alone can the tonnage difficulties be minimised and potential artillery development both in guns and shells of the combined French, British, and American armies be attained in 1918 and still more in 1919;With regard to very heavy artillery and certain special classes of long-range guns, the representatives of France and Great Britain recommend a separate and original manufacture by the United States. They also recommend that the existing production of 8-inch and 9 2-inch howitzer equipment in the United States shall be continued.Finally, if the above general principles are approved by the Governments of the three countries, the precise measures of manufacture and supply with programmes and time-tables shall be concerted by a technical commission composed of representatives of * the three Great Powers concerned.The situation will be quite different in 1918 from what it has been in 1917. In 1917 the British and French gun and howitzer output has been below the ammunition supply. In 1918 the reverse will be true. &quot;I he situation as to gun and ammunition supply and capacity^now is as follows. The French can and are willing to supply the American army as it arrives hi Europe with its full quota of 75 mm. field guns and with adequate supplies of shells for this size, provided that America furnish raw materials, propellants, and explosive in advance. The British have capacity to manufacture 6-inch howitzers sufficient to supply their own needs and to supply the American army as it arrives in Europe with its full quota, if America can supply 400 carriages for such howitzers. The British have not sufficient 6-inch shell capacity to supply their own requirements, to say nothing of American requirements, unless the supply of such shells which they have been obtaining from America and Canada is continued, at least to the extent available before America entered the war. That is to say, the British have [1214-1]
relied upon getting this shell from America and Canada, and have concentrated upon increasing their supply of this howitzer, and need this shell to carry out their 1918 programme. The British have reserves of propellant and explosives sufficient to complete Americas full quota 6-inch shells if American army should adopt that.howitzer, provided that America can replenish those reserves beginning 1st July, 1918. The French capacity for making 155-mm. howitzers and shells is sufficient to enable France to supply the American army as it arrives in Europe with its full quota for 1918 of both howitzers and shells of this size, provided that the raw materials for both howitzers and shells, and propellants and explosives, are furnished in advance by America. Italian requirements, due to recent losses, must, however, be met either by British or French to a very substantial amount. The British can furnish 8-inch and 9&quot;2-inch howitzers to equip the American army (or 1918 as it arrives. They urge continuation American activity in manufacture of howitzers and shells of these sizes.We are satisfied that only by co-ordination of all available capacity in the three countries can American troops here and troops of British and French be fully equipped for the great effort necessa^ in 1918, and urge that development of independent American programme be subordinated to the making of this effort.Specifically it is recommended that (a.) Sufficient 75-mm. field guns and ammunition be purchased from the French to equip the first divisions sent to France. The home programme for manufacture of this material should be continued. The home output for 19 J 8 will probably all be required for equipping and training of troops at home. The home manufacture of 75 mm. ammunition should be expedited all possible, and troops in France supplied from home as soon as home production is on an assured basis:(b.y That the factories of the United States and Canada heretofore engaged in the manufacture of British 6-inch howitzer ammunition be continued indefinitely, and extended if necessary to meet British requirements. This is of vital importance, as these shells are essential to 1918 campaign from every point of view. Serious consideration should even now he given to the question of our adoption of the British 6-inch howitzer in place of the French 155-mm. howitzer. The answer must depend to a large extent upon the extent to which American programme for manufacture 155 guns and shells has advanced. British and French are agreed that one howitzer is substantially as easy to make as the other. French are confident we shall have no difficulty in manufacture cf shell. British have had difficulty in making French shell, and fear that we will, whereas they point out that we have been making British shell for several years with great success and have men as well as plants that have proved they can turn them out. We cannot urge too strongly the importance of producing the largest possible amount of shells of this size, and recommend that the amount of shell which can certainly be produced be given great weight in determining type to be adopted. Subject to your decision as to type, we recommend that sufficient howitzers of the type selected be purchased from the French or the British to equip the first thirty divisions to arrive in France. We now have bought 260&apos; 155 howitzers from the French and must start with these. Home manufacture of the piece selected and its ammunition should be continued, the 1918 output being used for the equipping and training of troops at home. When the home output of ammunition is on an assured basis, troops in France should be supplied with ammunition from home sources. If the British 6-inch is adopted, provision should also be made for developing the manufacture of British 6-inch howitzer carriages in the United States to the.extent of 400 for the year 1918.(c.) Sufficient 155-rnm. Filloux guns and ammunition for the first thirty divisions to arrive in France should be purchased from the French. Home manufacture of this piece and of the 4&quot;7 gun and of ammunition for both these pieces should be developed energetically. No guns of these calibres are obtainable from British sources.(d.) Concerning heavy howitzers of the 9&quot;5-inch type, the outright adoption of the British 8-inch and 9&quot;2-inch howitzers is considered imperative. These calibres are of great and increasing importance. There is no hope of home production of 9&quot;5-inch howitzers before 19 L9. Sufficient 8-inch and 9&apos;2-inch howitzers can and should be obtained from British sources to equip the first thirty divisions to arrive in France^ The existing capacity for manufacture of British 8-inch and 9&quot;2-inch howitzers in the United States must be continue!, and existing plants for the manufacture of ammunition for these pieces must be maintained and others laid down in order to insure a sufficient supply of ammunition not only for our own
4-223needs but to provide a part of the needs of the British. Present plans for the manufacture of 9&apos;5-inch howitzers should be entirely subordinated to the preceding. -    v(e.) Trench mortars and ammunition of 3-inch Stokes, 6-inch Newton Stokes, and two 40 mm. types are obtainable from British and French sources to meet American demands until these demands can be supplied from home sources. Particular effort should be made to develop home manufacture of 6-inch Newton Stokes ammunition and two 40-mm. trench mortars and ammunition.(/.) With regard to super-heavy artillery, great effort should be made-for home production of railroad mounts for 12-inch mortars, 10-inch, 12-inch, and 14-inch sea-coast guns. It is imperative that sufficient numbers of these calibres be with-drawn from sea-coast forts to supply our armies in France, and if necessary to assist the British and French.The whole question as to how England, France, and- the United States can put forth their maximum effort during the critical year of 1918 has been considered in great detail by the Ministers of Munitions of Great Britain and France and by Perkins representing the United States, and by their technical assistance, and the preceding plan was fully and cordially agreed upon by all parties.It is most urgently recommended that the plan as outlined above be adopted by the United States, and that existing plans be subordinated where necessary for the purpose of carrying out these specific recommendations, and especially that all plans for the development of an independent programme by the United States be subordinated&apos;to the idea of the strongest possible joint effort, and that in every instance where we have established capacity and ability to manufacture no experiments be tried.
