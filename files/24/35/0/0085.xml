Both expressed themselves highly satisfied, and had found the oost of running small compared with the increased earnings.     &quot;They are very simple to run&quot;^ onid one, &quot;we can catch more fiBh than with sails, as we tow steadier.&quot;This experience is borne out at Poole, formerly one of the ports least willing to adopt motors.     Since the Committee&apos;s first installation there, opinion has changed, and applications cone in steaiily.The motor-boats placed by the Committee at Swansea tried trawling at first with indifferent results;   but have now learned by experience that in those waters the boats are best suited for lining; and since they took to lining much more satisfactory results have been reported.Freshwater Pish.Activity this week has been confined to the preparation of the Committee^ general report and recommendations in regard to eel fishing and cultivation.Pish Food Committee.Sprat Fishing^     Three thousand more boxes have been sold during this week, and sent from G-rimsby to the purchasers.The Committee approached the officer commanding the Royal Engineers at Brightlingsea for the loan of his motor lorries in case of a glut to take fish to the station.
