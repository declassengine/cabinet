(This Document is the Property of35Intellitgnnee Bureau,Department of Information,FFW/018.WEEKLY   REPORT   ON   PRANCE,   XVIII.(Dec. 6th, 1917, )The fortnight which has elapsed since the la^-re-por\-has pro-duced nothing to alter the impression then given that M. THjemteno^au had made a very favourable start as Prime Minister.    Not only is the smallness of the Minority which opposed the Vote of Confidence in the Chamber significant, but still more the fact that, in spite of the strictness of Socialist party discipline, 85 out of the 88 socialists and Deputies refused to follow their leaders into the lobby and, with M. Varenne, the former Socialist Minister, at their head abst&amp;ined from the division. . It is also generally recognised that K. Thomas&apos; speech in announcing that the Socialist party would oppose the vote was one of his least successful appearances in the Tribune;   even the &quot;Humanite&quot;, the party organ, hardly at-tempts to disguise the fact that his speech was a failure and Clemenceau&apos;s a success, while the Echo de Paris is able to assert that he sat down amid the indifference of the House and the disap-poinfcment of his party.     It is said that the Deputies were conscious of the strong feeling of the country for Clemenceau, and dared not, even if they wished, resist it.That feeling was mainly due to the expectation that Clemenceau would deal more vigorously and rapidly than anybody else with the treason scandals which fill Prance with anger, shame and suspicion. And in this field he has at once been faced with a very difficu&amp;t chaHonge.     M. Malvy, the late Minister of the Interior, who has been accused by M. Daudet and others of treason, even of giving military information to the enemy, has demanded that the Chamber should impeach him before the Senate and the Chamber by 512-2 has
agreed to do so.     The matter is complicated &quot;by legal difficulties, for the intention expressed by the Government many years ago of passing a law to fix the procedure in such cases has never been fulfilled.     The Senate has not however followed the advice given to it by the Debats which was that it should refuse to act,     On the contrary, it at once nominated a Commission to deal with the matter, end the Commission has very rapidly agreed to submit a method of procedure to the Senate.     This will involve a Bill which will have to go before the Chamber, and the Government will hardly be able to avoid giving Parliament some lead in the matter,     Yet the pitfalls in that course are many; for, on the one hand, II. Clemenceau has to respond to the call of &quot;Thorough&quot; which brought him   into power; and on the other his prolonged campaign against Malvy in the Senate and the Press obviously exposes him to charges of failing in the impartiality which is the duty of the Prime Minister.     let us hopv that his cleverness will not fail. him.     Meanwhile Malvy&apos;s tactics are obvious.     Few people believe him guilty of actual high treason.   He aims at getting a triumphant acquittal on that charge,&apos; and thus discrediting the real charge brought against him by his more responsible accusers like M. Clemenceau, viz. that as Minister of Interior he constantly blocked the efforts of the Army authori-ties to get at the traitors who were undermining the morale of the country, that some of the arrested Journalists actually received subventions from him out of public funds, and that he retained Leymarie, now changed with treason, at the head of the Surete Generale for weeks after he was cognizant of the fact that Leymarie had returned to Duval the suspicious cheque seized utxm him at the Swiss frontier.   Unless these issues can be dealt with by the Senate, it seems only too probable that after the trial the sore will still be left open and the Malvy &quot;affaire&quot; remain a danger and a source of disturbance tc the public mind.     There is also always the
possibility of its being followed by a Caollaux &quot;affaire&quot;.     M. Clemenceau caused a sensation in the Chamber the other.day by announcing the discovery that papers which had long been in the posession of the police had been kept from the knowledge of the magistrates who are examining into the present charges of dealings with the enemy, and added that new discoveries were being made every day.   What these discoveries are is of course not knwwn, but he asked for only a few days delay before making a further announce-ment.     Meanwhile report, busy as usual with Caillaux, says that Clemenceau has told private friends that 3ome of the evidence involves Caillaux in the Bolo and Almereyda affairs;   while evidence from Switzerland, described as very reliable , points to him as at the bottom of all the German intrigues of another groun of the traitors.     One cannot but doubt whether so astute a man can have been rash enough to commit himself to anything which would be real evidence against him; and he continuos to defy anyone to bring any proof of anything improper in his doings in Italy or elsewhere and has taken up the challenge of K. Herve of the Victoire to proseeute him for libel in connection with the charges.Of other matters there is not a great deal to record.   There have been signs of labour disturbances, from which France has on the whole been singularly free throughout the war.     It is highly to the honour of French workmen that their patriotism has kept them from exploiting a situation so much to their advantage:   but it must also be said that public opinion in France is much more ready to approve drastic methods of dealing with strikes than it is in England, and that such strikes as have occurred have in fact &quot;been much more drastically handled by the French Government than has been the case in England.     Clemenceau, as his past shows, is the men of all men for such methods but they may, just far tbdC
reason, be more dangerous when coming from him than ?/hen they came from M. Ribot or M. Painleve. And some of his enemies may not be at all above using this dangerous weapon against him. As this is written news cdme of a very serious strike among munition workers, but no details are  et known.The Labour question is everywhere connected with the food question   and Mi Clemencoau&apos;s task of dealing with Labour will not he made easier by the necessity of restricting the consumption of bread and some other things such as petrol.     Visitors to Prance wonder whether the restrictions will be more strictly enforced than previous restrictions which apnear to have been widely and al-nQst openly defied.   And they wonder why Northern prance should be in want and expect food from the Allies while food abounds in the South.     But at any rate the steps about to be taken are prima facie evidence of the seriousness of the Government&apos;s resolve t( deal with the matter and of its cohfidence in the good will and spirit of endurance of the country.    It is well also to note that K. Bofcet, in explaining his programme to the Press, spoke plainly of the policy which he had rejected as that of continuing to im-port freely an abundance of food which would enable the country to live for a time in a plenty and comfort &quot;of which our Allies have voluntarily deprived themselves, the very Allies we are asking to feed us.&apos;&quot;   These are generous words and of good omen.     The new regulations include bread cards for towns of over 2000 inhabitants, and considerable restrictions on confectionery shops.     The c^rds will be individual, not family cards.     No one, excent peasants using their own flour will be allowed more bread per day thai the soldier at the front receives;   but within this limit the amount allowed varies greatly between 21 and 7 ounces a day according to age, sex, and occupation.     The regulations are expected to come
into force-on. January 1st.     The&apos; MniJ3l^^be enforced in the fullest-Tig-our for the next few months at any rate in order to build up again the reserves of food which had been so sadly depleted.
