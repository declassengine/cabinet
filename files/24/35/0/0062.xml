Ookzwl Jqaes . I(THIS IOC.UMBNT IS THE PRQgBRTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.)253SECRET. G.T.-2962WAR     CABINET.MAN-POWER AND RSCRUITIHG.Memorandum from the First Conuniss loner of Works.In reference to the &apos;7ar Cabinet Minutes Ho. 293 (Bos, 17 &amp; 18), I wish to offer the following considerations respecting, (I), Labour Shortage, (II), Utilisation of German Prisoner Labour, (III), Economy and Substitution, which I think require your earnest attention.I. LABOUR SHORTAGE.In view of the general labour shortage and the necessity of releasing more men from the Army, I would suggest that the question of obtaining labour from neutral countries, such as Holland, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and possibly Spain, should receive careful consideration.   According to newspaper accounts, there is an increasing amount of unemployment in these various countries.   Germany in spite of its very poor food condition, is endeavouring continually, and with a certain amount of success, to obtain labour from some of these countries.In view of the fact that we could offer very much more attractive conditions of life and better wages than are paid in Germany, it ought to be possible to recruit from these various countries labour for land, building and for skilled work, as well as for general labour work.     It would require a special depart-ment of the National Service to be organised T^ith live agents in these various countries in order to carry through successfully such a scheme.   It would also bo necessary to consult labour leaders in this country to explain to them the reasons which necessitate this course of action and to ensure their co-operation.Of the Allied countries, Portugal and Finland seem to possess sources of labour which are fairly accessiblet   I under-stand that the Portuguese troops at the front have proved very efficient from a labour point of view, and Finland on the other hand has provided very good workmen,   In both these countries the economic conditions are such that it would aopsar to be not very difficult to obtain recruits.II. GERMAN PRISONER LABOUR.Another question is the utilisation of labour on a larger scale in this country.   My Department has had occasion to use some of -these men to a considerable extent in various large building jobs with satisfactory results.   The Department, however, hos been refused the use of German Prisoner Labour on various large munition works on the grounds that prisoners of war should not be engaged in this work.
In view of tho entire disregard of the German Government of any such provision and its utilisation of prisoner labour direct in the field, is it not time that this regulation be withdrawn in this country?     I might instance in the account the very urgent and important work of re-establishing the Shell Filling Factory at Moroc&amp;mbe Bay, for which German prisoner labour&apos; has been refused-.III. ECONOMY AND SUBSTITUTION.During my year of office in this Department, I have frequently had brought to my notice the spasmodic and uneconomical way in which available labour is used on Government works.   Every Department seems to start off on schemes of its own, which require both labour and material, some of which may not fructify for a very long times     They are schemes of more or less urgency and are being commenced simultaneously with other large work, with inadequa labour supplies and with the result that instead of any of them getting finished an* being of use, they are carried, on indetermi-nately and continue under construction for s considerable time. I understand that a Committee has been formed under the Presidency of General Smuts in order to deal with Priorities and that this Committee has appointed a number of sub-committees, including a Building Construction Committeec    I would respecfully submit that as most of these sub-committees consist of officials of Govern-ment Departments without any plenary power and whose function is that of an advocate for their own Departments rather than a judge of the questions that cade before them., the results to. be obtained are scarcely likely to be cf a far-reaching character.   It would appear to me that if more use were ma.de of the Ministers, whose departmental duties do not occupy them their entire time, on such committees and who would necessarily be entrusted with greater power and greater authority, more effective decisions would be arrived at with considerably greater speed than, is now achieved.(Signed)     .ALFRED MOND.12th December, 1917c
