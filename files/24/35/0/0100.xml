SECRET.ministey  of  food.Week.ending Wednesday, December 12, 1917.Control of Supplies and Prices.PART I-ACTION  TAKEN.Allied Purchases. Mr. Owen Smith cables to the Inter-Allied Meat and Fats Executive that Mr. Hoover is extending the list of commodities .which can only be purchased in the United States through the Commission, and states that Mr. Hoover is urging that finance should be made available for the elimination of the system of private Allied purchases so as to enable him to control prices in America by means of purchase co-ordination. Mr. Hoover states that he cannot indefinitely prolong per-mission to import articles as yet unscheduled.Mr. Owen Smith cables that a firm of Chicago packers have received from their London agent an inquiry for 5,000 tons of frozen meat monthly from January to August 1918, and describes this as &quot; An acute instance of competition between ourselves and some unknown British buyer.&quot;Mr. Owen Smith has been told to notify all Canadian packers of the Ministry&apos;s intention to withdraw the licences for import of Canadian bacon, hams, and lard on private account, thus giving the Mission control of such Canadian imports, in accord-ance with the scheme of co-ordinating Inter-Allied purchases. The Canadian Goverment have allocated credit for five million dollars for these purchases in Canada.The Meats and Fats Executive have cabled the estimated Allied requirements for the months of February, March, April, May, and June 1918, in accordance with Mr. Hoover&apos;s request, and also buying orders for January, so far as credits for,.these could be obtained from the Treasury.Mr. Hoover cables that his conservation measures have resulted in an unexpected surplus of meat. In view of this and the serious situation in the Argentine, where, owing to labour troubles, the military are guarding the packing r/lants, Vwith con-sequent delay of beef shipments, Mr. Hoover asks for re/frigerated ships^o&apos;be diverted from the Argentine to the United States where tvyenfy million polrids of beef are immediately available for shipment. /, fPrior to the receipt of this cable, contracts for 6,202,500 pounds of frozen beef, and 1,000,000 pounds frozen boneless beef, and 264,000 six-pound tins of corned beef  all for early shipment had been arranged by Mr. Owen Smith&apos;s Mission.Buying orders for 14,690 tons bacon, hams, and 3,880 tons of lard, with a total valuation of 12,479,000 dollars, for delivery between December 24- and January 14, have been submitted by Mr: Owen Smith to the Food Administration at Washington, for approval.Mr. Hoover has cabled to Lord Rhondda that, owing to difficulties of transport, it will be impossible for the United States to dilute wheat flour, and that a saving in wheat to increase the exportable surplus must be obtained by the separate use of American cereals. Mr. Iioover adds that over forty per cent, of the breadstuffs in the United States are now composed of maize.Bacon, Bums, and Lard. Coventry, Birmingham, and Cannock Chase have been given special allotments of bacon in order to ailay the discontent and to avoid the danger of strikes in these areas. A special allotment has also been made to Sunderland for the mine sweepers.The position of Ireland which presented considerable difficulty under the Distribution Scheme has now been settled. It has been arranged that Ireland will come into the Scheme with a slight adjustment of dates.It has been arranged to give the War Office Liaison Officer the earliest possible intimation of diminution in supply, but it is confidently expected that the demands of the Army can be fully met.The question of tonnage for these commodities has become acute.   It was understood that 35,000 tons had been allotted for December, but it appears that about 23,000 tons only will be available.   The matter is being taken up urgently. a\dth the Ministry of Shipping.14.  (33)4531-2   Pkl   90   12/17   E&amp;S a
Butter. The Butter Distribution Scheme is now in operation; 2,500 tons of butter have been sent out in the first distribution which took&apos; place last week ; this amount constitutes one-sixth of the total applications for December. It is hoped to distribute a similar amount on 17th December, and further distributions will take place in January. Two cargoes of butter have arrived recently from Australia, which will enable the second December distribution to be carried out, and will provide part of the supply for January. The maximum retail price of Government butter is at present 2s. 6d. per lb.Cereals. The Bread (Use of Potatoes) Order, No. 2, 1917, dated 8th December 1917, provides that bakers who use potatoes for the manufacture of bread shall give, on receipt of each delivery, a declaration to the effect that potatoes so received shall not be sold, disposed of, or used, except for that purpose, and that all previous eon-sisnments have been, or will be, so used.- The local control of the supply of potatoes to bakers for this purpose will be in the hands of the Fond Control Committee. The Committees will accept orders from the bakers within their district, and will make arrangements for supplies to be available. Leaflets for the guidance of bakers have been issued, and steps will be taken to extend the use of potatoes as widely as possible.Cheese. An Order has been issued controlling the prices of imported Dutch cheese from the 10th December to the 17th January; the conditions as to sales by . wholesale and retail applicable to British cheese being now applied.   The prices and period of control have been fixed in agreement with the Dutch &quot;Landbau Export Bureau.&quot;Coffee. iV Coffee Advisory Committee has been appointed, and the first meeting will take place on the 14th December.Dried Firuits.-Cables have been received from Mr. Burlumi stating that he has purchased 5,000 tons at the price which was agreed upon with M. Venizelos, viz., an average of 49s. per cwt. f.o.b. About 750 tons have been loaded on a ship which has now left Patras, and, in addition, the same ship is bringing 400 tons from Patras and 350 tons from Zante of the last season&apos;s currants which we have taken over from the C.W.S. A cable has been sent to Mr. Burlumi authorising the purchase of a further 5,000 tons to be ready for shipment before January 31st, 1918, and in the meantime instructions have been issued as to the shipment of the balance of the first contract of 5,000 tons before December 31st.Information has been received from the Foreign Office as to the signing of the Spanish Commercial Agreement, whereby we are under an obligation to purchase at least 6,000 tons of raisins. It is understood that arrangements are being made with the Treasury to enable us to make these purchases, and, if we desire to do so, to buy further quantities of raisins and Spanish figs.Messrs. Churchouse &amp; Co. have arranged contracts on our behalf for about 700 tons of Indian sultanas, to be shipped before 25th December.Margarine. In order to meet the present demand for margarine, crushers have been instructed not to sell or deliver crude oils to any other than refiners ; the refiners have also been notified that they must only deliver to margarine makers. Steps are being taken to keep the reiineries fully occupied, and large quantities of goods held by neutrals are being taken for the refineries in this country.As a result of these measures it is hojDed to keep the output of margarine at the maximum.Meat. A licence has been issued exempting from the operation of the Pigs (Maximum Prices) Order breeding sows and small pigs under 30 lbs. in weight sold for store purposes.   These may therefore now be sold without restriction.The Meat (Restriction of Retail Sales) Order was issued by the Food Controller on the 11th December, restricting sales of meat by retail butchers between 17th December 1917 and 13th January 1918, to the amount sold by them in the four weeks ending 27th October 1917.The Food Controller felt it necessary to take this step in order to limit the sales of meat at Christmas, and the October period was taken as the basis of this restriction because returns have already been received from butchers as to their sales during that month.
Oil Seeds. The following are the amounts of oil and oil seeds imported from West Africa during the month of November, 1917 : Palm kernels    -      -      -      -      -      -   18,189 tons.Ground nuts     -      -      -      - -    ] .476 tons.Palm oil   ------      -    7,213 tons.These amounts are all below the requirements of this country. Ships&apos; Stores. The Ships&apos; Stores Order, 1917, dated December 5, 1917, prohibits the supply of food (including live stock) or of drink to any ship without the sanction of the Port Authorities. The Order does not apply to ships flying the white ensign, to coasting vessels, to home-trade ships clearing for the voyage to and from Brest or French ports north and east of Brest, to hospital and troop ships, or to the supply of food by or to any one person on any one day not exceeding 10s. in value.Sugar. No further losses of sugar cargoes have been incurred. The attention of the Sugar Commission has been drawn to a report by a sub-committee of a body described as the Commercial Committee of the House of Commons, to which is annexed as an appendix a memorandum purporting to give an account of the proceedings taken at the beginning of the war, and since, in respect of the sugar supply. The memorandum is a tissue of inaccuracies from beginning to end. The Chairman of the Commission has written to Sir John Eandles, chairman of the body in question, to ask for an explanation of the circumstances under which the memorandum was received, and apparently endorsed by the Committee. Sir John has promised to investigate the matter, and to communicate again later. Meanwhile he states that the Committee has asked the Prime Minister to receive a deputation which shall present the report to him.Tea. The negotiations for the purchase of India and Ceylon tea on Government . account have been satisfactorily concluded. All tea shipped by growers subsequently to the 31st October, 1917, is included in the scheme. It has also been arranged to purchase all tea shipped by private importers since the 31st October and all tea in their possession in India and Ceylon which has been bought and not yet shipped.A meeting has been held with the sub-committee of the Tea Control Committee dealing with distribution. The rates of profit suggested for the wholesaler and retailer were discussed at length and the possibility of distributing tea in more than one grade.A meeting has also been held with representatives of the wharfingers to discuss the possibility of lowering rates on Government tea.Cold Storage and Transport.The War Priorities Committee of the War Cabinet have granted priority for cold storage at the following places :  Grade 1.

The remaining cases brought before the War Priorities Committee, including additional storage at Liverpool, are deferred for further consideration. It is, however, essential that the proposal to provide increased accommodation at Liverpool should be dealt with at the earliest possible moment, and this is being pressed forward.In connection with the statements that have been made from time to time regarding food wastage at the docks of the country, this matter has been taken in
