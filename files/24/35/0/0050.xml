The Air Ministry Headquarters Staff occupies at thepresent moment approximately 290,000 square feet, and a further 40,000 square feet, including the offices of the Metropolitan Water Board, and the Covent Garden Hotel will shortly be placed at their disposal.2*. Lord Rothermere states definitely that the housing-of the Air Ministry in Hotel premises is most wasteful,, and that&apos; the accommodation of the staff in large rooms will enable him to effect a considerable reduction in their numbers, at the same time increasing the unit efficiency.    He is pressing for the British uuseum to be placed at his disposal at the earliest possible moment.3.. It is estimated that 190,000 square feet ofaccommodation suitablejfor office purposes can be obtained at the museum, and there is almost unlimited means- of expansion by the erection of temporary buildings on the vacant ground-in the front and rear;.4. Many of the exhibits on account of their bulk andweight would have, to remain in the Museum and would be .-placed against the walls,  but the clearance of the-&apos;-&apos;.(&apos;.&apos;! .&apos;   -&apos;i&apos; .-v&apos;.. . .y r     &apos; - -        ,. -remaining
remaining exhibits to.places of safety, though involving an enormous amount of labour, is not an insuperable task, and should be accomplished within three or four months.5. A strong public feeling exists that GovernmentBuildings, such as museums, etc., should be fully utilised before any more Hotels or business premises are requisitioned, and as the British ^useum, a small part of which is already in use as offices, would afford the i   requisite amount of space, it is submitted that the authority of the l-far Cabinet should be given for the museum to be utilised for occupation as offices, though every effort would be made to exclude the Reading Room and the Copyright Section, but this would necessitate utilising the official residences.   These latter- are extremely useful, as they afford rooms already partitioned suitable for the higher administrative staff.
