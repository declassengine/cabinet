XXI. $Dec, 13tht 1917)Parliament and Government.The proposal to establish Parliamentary Commissions on the French model is supported not only by the Deputies of the Parliamentary Union1 (alias the S7) and by the official Socialist Group but also by the Interventionists of the Left - Radicals, Republican and Reformist Socialists.     Its champions in the Senate are Signori Tittoni and K. Ferraris.     Those who favour the proposal are said to form a majority of the Chamber wuthout counting the official Socialists.     But, while the Interventionist Left is actuated by a genuine desire (1) for democratic ct-operation in Foreign Policy, (2) for a means of offering advioe and unofficial information to Ministers and of stimulating the Government to a more energetic con-duct of the war, the leading spirits at least in the Parliamentary Union, are credited with the desire to prepare the way for a Giolittian regime by getting rid of the Ministers who stand for the prosecution of the war and solidarity with the Allies and if necessary of the whole Government.    Their original idea seems to have been that the leaders of the Government - Signor$ Orlando and Nitti - would offer but a half-hearted resistance to these manoeuvres, so far as they are aimed against Sonnino and Bissolati.     But the pressure of events has made evident the necessity for solidarity in the Ministry and it   has made known that the Government will oppose the proposal for Commissions.    At the same time Giolitti appears to have hinted to his supporters that the moment for decisive action has not come.     It seems that the Government will offer some compromise - possibly a Secret Session - and that this
will be accepted by the Union which now numbers over 200 adherents. The Government is essentially a Government of compromise, and its leaders seem to be convinced, rightly or wrongly, that pro-German and pacifist feeling is too strong and too widely spread to be dealt with by any drastio measures of repression such as are demanded by the Interventionist forces.    This seems to have been throughout the view of the Minister cf the Interior and that Signor ffitti is in agreement with him is shown by  the statements recently made by him in a Press interview.     &quot;We must avoid&quot;, he said, &quot; all un-neeossary reaction.     Reaction is first and foremost a state of consciousness.     We must avoid it.     We have to convince our ad-versaries, not strangle them&quot;.War Aims.In the matter of War-aims Signer Nitti would seem to be equallyprepared for moderation and compromise.     In the interview referredon the subjectto he is reported to have expressed himself/as follows:-   &quot;We have no territorial aspirations nor dreams of greatness which are out of conformity with the realities of the situation.   Moreover Italy oan never by her attitude constitute an obstacle to peace.   Italy must remain united to her Allies at the cost of any sacrifice what-ever:   it is her vital duty and her necessity&quot;.Pood.Describing the steps taken by the Government to meet the numerous difficulties of Italy&apos;s situation he said in regard to food, thst whether the war came to an end or no, the problem for Italy remained the same.   Without the help of the Allies they mudt die of starvation.     Consumption must positively be reduoed and pro-duo ti on increased instead of being diminished as has actually been the case during the war - in the islands actually to the extent of - 25^    The Government had taken effective measures to this end which
would be shortly   - announced.   It was raising the.price of grain in order to encourage farmers to increase late sowings for 1918.   1?o-tatoes too must be largely cultivated to make up for shortage of cereals.gingnce.He begged the public not to give way to panic.   There had beena certain tendency to withdraw deposits from banks.     This was badpolicy and would, if it continued, oblige the Minister of the Treasuryto increase the circulation of paper money which would in its turnoccasion a rise in prioes.    There was no reason for panic.     Italy&apos;sand,financial position was highly satisfactory,/thanks to the help given by her Allies, her difficulties would soon be diminished.   The Government was taking in i?and the question of Exchange whioh would shortly show a sensible fall in the rate, the result principally of the combined action of the Allies.     The next financial state-ment shortly to be made in the Chamber would restore confidence in the Credit of the Country and there would be an increased demand for Government securities.Enemy Porpaganda. etc.As may be inferred from Signor Nitti&apos;s language, no very serious measures seem to have been taken by the Italian Government to deal with enemy subjects of whom there were recently said to be 500 resident in Rome alone.    They are at present under supervision of the Ministry of the Interior.     The Messagero suggests that the fune-tion would be hotter performed by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The agreement signed on May 81st 1915 - two days before Italyfs declaration of War on Austria- for the reciprocal protection of German and Italian subjects resident in Germany and Italy is still in force.     Its annulment is demanded by the press of the Interven-tionist Left, as a preliminary to the internment of enemy subjects
and the confiscation of enemy, property.     That esp&amp;jQnage, the spreading of disquieting rumours and denigration of Allies,-especially of Great Britain - still flourish is proved by the abun-danfc condemnation of these activities in the Press, stories of talk in railway carriages and the like.    Pro-German sentiments are common among the upper classes and business world and many officials and officers are married to German wives wftose activities it is very difficult to control.Socltalist anti-war propaganda is atill active, if less openly than formerly, and the Secretary of the Party, Lazaari, is said to be asking for subscriptions to a fund in favour o  Tthe victims of persecution at Turin1.&apos;    A telegram to the Times.speaks of a police raid on the offices of the party-organ, Avanti, but results are not reported.   Three ex-Deputies, who had been 4n touch with Oavallini, the ftiend of Bolo and of the ex-Khedive, hare been arrested.    On Dec. 6th a Decree was promulgated by which the War-Zone is extended to the provinces of Bergamo, Como, Milan, Hodena, UoV&amp;ra, Parma, Pavia and Reggie Emilia.The Vatican.Cardinal Gasparri, the Papal Secretary of State, has telegraphed to Cardinal Bourne, Archbishop of Westminster, authorising him to deny statements which recently appeardd in a London journal to the discredit of the Pope and the Catholic clergy of Italy.A further telegram has been despatched by the Pope to the-Oorern-* ments of the Central Empires, conjuring them to lay aside, in con-formity with the principles recorded and accepted in his appeal, any proposals, whould they entertain such, for the lasting annexa-tion of Italian territory.The fact that this communication has been made has not so far been published in the Vatican organs.
According to a Times telegram of Dec. 12th the Vatican press (wwth one exception) is somewhat lukewarm in its reception of the news of the liberation of Jerusalem and betrays some anxiety lest the rights and interests of the Catholic Church Bhould not be adequately respee-tod and recognised.    On the 12th the Vatican itself remained silent. On the 13th the Cardinal Vicar published a manifesto announcing a thanksgiving servioe for Sunday next in the Basilica of Santa Crooe in Cerusalemme and remarking that the &quot;strictly religious&quot; joy and triumph which the Cardinal Vioer feelB in the event is clouded by the fact that the liberators of the Holy Sepulchre are not all united in the Catholic faith.     In an article on the taking ef Jerusalem pub-lished on Dec 6th      the Clerical and Chauvinist Mattino of Naples oriticises the Sionist idea in a spirit of hostility and mistrust. According to the writer the only satisfactory settlement would be to attach the Holy Places to Rome.&apos;as &amp;bdul Hamid attached Mecca to Stambul&apos;, thus creating a powerful centre of religious attraction and providing the Latin world and the Italians, &quot;to whom the personal supremacy of the CathoJ-ic world is inevitably destined&quot;, with a mag-nificent base for cosmopolitan influence and for penetration into the heart of Asia.     &quot;But,&quot; the article concludes, &quot;we shall not do any of those things, because it seems to Italy indispensable to run at the heels of all manner of absurdities, among which the most upsetting is this - the project of making a present of a state to a ppor people which at present holds in its hands the sceptre of all the Russiaa&quot; (referring to Lenin&apos;s supposed Jewish origin) The ffnlted States and Austria.There is great rejoicing in the Italian press over the declaration of war on Austria by the United States, and the hope is expressed that President Wilsonfs views on   dismemberment may after all turn out to be reconcileable with Italian aspirations.
