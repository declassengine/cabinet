l/Railways/313.T7AR CABI3QTtCo-trdination of allied transport requirements.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.I circulate for the information of the War Cabinet the subjoined memorandum by Sir Guy Granet, Director General of Iiovements and Railways.As you know I am in sympathy with the suggestion that some machinery should be set up to oo-crdinate the transportation requirements and facilities of the Allies on the v/estern front, (Franca, Belgium and Italy) and so far as possible to give ;:a co-ordinated opinion as to the feasibility of movements of   a big nature&quot;.I think, however, certain fasts should be faced and certain reservations should be made,1,    Y/hether the new machinery is run by an Englishman or a foreigner any co-ordination muat be - so far as rolling stock and equipment is concerned - at the expense of Great Britain.(a) The French have declared their inability to oarry out their original obligation to provide transportation for the British Army,.     As a ocnsequence we have imported hundreds of locomotives, thousands of wagons, thousands of niles of track, an enormous amount of equipment for ports, roads, repair shops, etc.(b) The French have had to call in aid the resources cf the British Empire in order to supply their own transportation naoda not only for material &quot;but personnel,(c) Italy is incapable of supplying her own transportation needs,(d) The Americans, owing to shipping difficulties will find it hard to supply their own immediate necessities,(e) Any difficulties to be apprehended as regards land transportation are essentially difficulties owing tt lack of facilities, and oan only be overcome by oonstruction of new lines and depots and importation of track, locomotives, wagonb and equipment generally.Under existing conditions Great Britain is the tnly source of supply.
2.     This roust probably be accepted, but unless the co-ordinating authority is under British control, there is the danger that our resources nay be frittered away, and that our capacity for effective effort in every theatre of war nay be reduced.3.     Great Britain is engaged outside the Western Front inthree considerable theatres of war - Syria, Mesopotamia, East Africa - in each of which she is fighting practically alone - and each of which involves the use not only of railway material but of shipping to a very large extent. These theatres I submit should be outside the scope of the new authority.4.     The new co-ordinating authority should deal xmly with the railway material and equipment actually in being cn the Western Front* and should have no control over supply.   That is to say, they should co-ordinate the proper use of the existing material, they should form an opinion as to what more material should be provided and make a recommendation as to what country should supply it, but they should have no executive power to place orders or to divert material in England earmarked for other theatres,5,     The constitutional position of the new authority will require uareful thought and definition in order to avoid duplication and clashing of responsibility.DERBY.3th December, 1917.
