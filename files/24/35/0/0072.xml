13tb December, 1917.1.        Apart from military events and the prospeot of a great German offensive on the Western front, which the German press is anticipating, the negotiations with &quot;the present holders of power in Petrograd&quot; is much the most important event of tho last week.    $0 Judge from the latest reports, the point which is arousing most interest in Germany is the position taken by the military authorities.    As the negotiations in their present form are merely for the agreement as to an armistice, they are natur-ally placed in the bands of the army;   it is, however, anticipated by some, and apprehended by others - especially by the Socialists -that the opportunity will be used in order to prejudice any nego-tiations for peace which might ensue.     In consequence the whole question of the relations between the military and the civil authorities in determining conditions of peaoe is being raised. This is not only a matter of the highest general importance for all nations, but it is, in Germany, one of particular interest, for it recalls the repeated struggles which Bismarck had with the military authorities both in 1866 and 1871.     5?he question of annexation or non-annexation at once becomes no longer aoademio but practical and urgent;   the future policy of Germany with regard to Poland and the Baltic Provinces comes up, and there is a very real fear among the opponents of annexation that the ques-tion may be prejudiced and that the military may take the whole control into their own hands.    Under these oiroumstances the eventual settlement of peaoe on the Eastern frontier might be conducted on the lines of Realpolitik and not on those of what
tbe military people would regard as more sentimentalise;   they would attach no importance to general conceptions such as &quot;non-annexation&quot; or the establishment of a Ic&amp;?:ue of Nations.   Thoir mind is reflected in the hook Jclgarungon aus dem V/eltkriege by General von iTeytag Iioringhoven, the interest of wbiofc is that it argues the situation purely from the military point of view and anticipates that after the war the affairs of Europe will oontinue to bo conduoted on principles such as those which pro-vailed before the war. .       It is pointed out that notwithstanding Hertling1&apos;-many admirable qualities, he has neither the preBtige nor the physical vigour to hold his own against Hindenburg.    In previous reports it has boen suggested that wo must clearly distinguish between the military, in the sonee of the actual fighting chiefs of the army, and the civilians, journalists and politicians, who advocate extreme and violent views,    The distinction is a real one and oxists in other countries as well as Germany.    This is of importance in connection with the view which has been put forward that there is a tendency, even among the workingmen, ti regard with greater rospeot the military authorities than they do the civil government.    Wo are also told that Ludendorff has been negotiating with the Trades Unionists.    Wo have been told by a we&amp;l informed Amerioan $journalist, who has kept in touch with the country since he left Germany last February, that the military fin the strict sense of the word) are not politically-minded, and that Buoh difficulty as occurs has oome rather from the Generals in chargo of tho army corps districts at home;   for it is in their hands that the control of the censorship and of the right 6f association and public meeting has been placed. It is quite possible, therefore, that a growing feeling will become effective in favour of tho genuine military authority, i.e. the General Staff, as against the Foreign Ofiice and the
289politieians, and they may quite possibly he called in as the Deus ex machlnS to settle matters if the politicians fail.    If it was quite certain that it was the real army chiefs and not people like Rovantlow and Tirpitz who had the upper hand, the outcry raised by the Liberal press against military interference would probably not meet with any strong echo in the country.We are told also by tho same authority that Rindenburg is really the leader;   ludondorff is perhaps cleverer, but the weight of will, authority and purpose i% with Hingenburg.3.       It may be suggested that the conclusion of an armis-tioe with Russia on any terms which the military would aooept, is improbable, and that from the purely military point of view not much is to be gained by it, unless it included the return of German prisoners and some supply of corn.    ill Information points to the fact that the Germans are now transferring large numbers of troops, and probably also big guns, from the Eastern to the Western front;   even if an armistioe were concluded, it would still be necessary to keep a comparatively large force to hold the oooupied districts.    As ve may assume that under no oircum-stances will there be any serious fighting by the Russians during the winter, tho size of this force will not be much influenced by the conclusion of an armistioe.    Under tgese circumstances, negotiations have a politioal rather thaa a military impor-tance.    It i;; impossible that any serious Geruwi politicians -let alone the military - can desire that the Bolsheviks should remain in authority at Petrograd;   it is therefore cuite probable that the Ger-a&amp;aswill aim at bringing about a rupture in the hope that this will destroy the influence of the Bolsheviks in Russia itself and that they will make way for another government which will be of a loss uncompromising nature, but will also seriously desire peaoe;   i.e. the Gci -r/&apos;S mcy reckon on the Russian desire for peace as one of. the chief elements of the internal situation and hope that if the Bolsheviks, by the excessive nature of their
290demands, fail in securing &quot;this, their position will be undermined and they will, give way for someone with whom the Ger^-ao cr,n really do business.    Of course the military are hardly the people to conduct negotiations with the discretion-necessary to bring about this result.   A wise course would bo to allow a rupture to arise naturally from the mistakes of the Bolsheviks;   more probably they will force it by their own exaggerated and arrogant terms.However this may be, we shall probably have to reckon with a general drift of all the moro Conservative elements, not only in Russia but also in Poland, towards Germany;   there always comes a period when the fear of social anarohy becomes stronger than national feeling.    This will be the great opportunity for Germany;   it will be her mission, while satisfying the reasonable desires for refoim at home by moderate changes which will leave in Hertling&apos;s words &quot;the essential foundations of the State un-altered&quot;, to use all her influence in order to restore order in Russia and to establish both in Russia itsolf and among the Western Slavs, governments which will be friendly to Germany, and at the same time, will have an administrative capacity to provide for the financial resources of the State and for the personal security and daily bread of the inhabitants.    Unless they spoil the game by adopting a definitively reactionary policy, as for instance by an attempt to restore the Tsardom or establish a military autocracy, it is difficult to see what can be done to interfere with this.If this view is correct, then it would appear that the establishment of a more moderate Government in Russia, whether by the Moderate Socialists or the Cadets, andany general overthrow of the Bolsheviks, would be more in the German than the Allied interests.4.       The Debates on the Prussian Reform Bill have begun. From the telegraphic reports received, it is clear, as might havo been anticipated, that there will be opposition to the utmost from
a certain numbor of the Prussian Conservatives;   as their loader said:   wIf a Bill is brought in which is to the prejudice of Crown and Fatherland, then it is the duty of the most devoted Royalist to oppose the wishes of the King in such a matter&quot;* Friedborg, the Minister in charge of the Bill, answered that the giving of equal suffrage rights was really the desire of the Crown, and that the Crown and Government must use every consti-tutional means in order to redeem the promise given.... 111 do not fear the effects of a refusal upon the Crown but I do fear  for the bourgeois&apos;fi.e. non-socialist) parties&quot;.    In this he was addressing especially the National-Liberals.    He is pointing out that in the future any party that opposed such a measure of reform introduced by the Government with the personal support of tho King, would inevitably moet with a complete disaster if there were an appeal to tho country.    We have then the conception of She Emperor, as King of Prussia, himself initiating a project of moderate and reasonable reform which, while it leaves the essen-tial foundations of the State unchanged, will satisfy the just demands of the great masses of reasonable men.    This conception seems an important and a just one;   it will meet with warm support, and the internal prospects in Germany are much more favourable than they have recently been, supposing of course that thero is no military defeat and the food supply holds out.     Of course there will be a certain number of Conservatives who would be prepared to die in the last ditch;   the practical question is whether the great bulk of the Conservative Party will follow them, or whether they will try to bring about a compromise. The only thing we oan say is that apparently the passage of the Bill will be slow;   the discussions will be prolonged for many monthft, and probably no conclusion will be come to before next Anril.     In the meantime, many things may happen.5.       All seems to show that the hopes of Germany are now being concentrated on a last great effort in the West;   the word
292is going out that a military victory will he achieved.     If this succeeds, well;   if it fails, then a real and probably final crisis will come.     Herr von Waldow, the Prussian State Gorodtsioner of the War  eedinc Dei;*: rtiAft.it,  ave in the tod tag a very unsatis-factory picture of the new harvest;   he said that it might be necessary again to decrease the meat ration, and that it had been impossible to oarry out tho proposal for raising the potato ration in the spring;   the distribution of eggs had completely failed. This must be read in connection with very pessimistic statements whioh come on good authority from Vienna, and we hear on apparent-ly good authority that if there is not a victory by Pebruary, starvation in Saxony is imminent.    We know now that the situation in the early summer of the present year was extremely critical and every indication seems to show that unless large supplies are available from Roumania or Russia, it must be worse next year. All therefore seems to point to the attempt to win a great mili-tary victory immediately.6.       There is no doubt always present in the minds of the Government the fear of a groat social revolution;   this must be increased by the fear that the elements of disorder will spread from Russia;   these things spread quickly between European States -much more-quickly than they spread from the Continent to this country.     Reports continue to justify the opinion that this will not happen during the course of the war unless there is a military defeat or unless the shortage of food amounts to actual starvation. The Minority Socialists do not appear to be hopeful;   an Austrian Socialist, who had talked with their leaders, expressed to us very definitely the opinion that they had not the courage and reso-lution (Mut) to put t$omse&amp;ves at the head of any serious rising. Lsst fijay there was a strike in Berlin of 300,000 workers;   the Socialist Leaders refused to identify themselves with it;   he asked them why;   their answer was:   &quot;hat can we do?   Revolution must come of itself&quot;..    But revolutions do not come of themselves;
9 0 9 &amp;3 0they require determined and reckless leaders;   without leadership they evaporate in local disorders and achieve nothing.    iocal disorders there are.    It has been asserted that the German people has homo its sufferings and privations with great stoicism,   $his may have been the case, but there is now much evidence that the strain is causing a general moral degeneration,    A leading Berlin journal stated the other day that the newspapers can no longer find room in their columns for accounts of tho daily crimes against life and property which are being committed,    The food scarcity has loads illioit traffic almost universal;   offioials are sflfojeot* od to unprecedented temptations in the way of bribes, and there are daily or weekly reports in the papers of great thefts on the railways.    In private households nobody&quot;s larder is safe, and it is noted that people who suffer from the depredations of food-thieves do not like to report their losses because the stolen/ food has usually been acquired in an illicit way.    Thefts of money by burglary, by pilfering and by violence are also in-creasing to an alarming extent.    The companies which insure against burglaries have made their conditions more stringent, and the increase in premiums ranges from 50 to 200 per cent. The innumerable official^ restrictions and by-laws, by multiply-ing legal offencos, have created an atmosphere of lawlessness, and the floating population is influenced by this situation with the result that there is an appalling increase of serious crime.Ifflfrfte is in Berlin, and the little we hear from Saxony indicate similar conditions there.      Saxony is sery thickly peopled   there is a very large proportion of poorly paid workingmen;   disorder and lawlessness are always more common than in Prussia;   the influence of the Government is less and the reactionary elements in the Govern^nt are strong.   There is not the moderating influence which the Roman Catholic Church exer-cises in Westphalia, and it is here that probably fciote and dis-order would first assume a serious aspect.
The motive force of any revolutionary movement would be the belief that the distress arises not only from the war hut is acosatuatod by the profiteering, both of the landed proprietors and of the capitalist classes.    It is essential for the German Government to dispel this belief.    This is one reason why they might even welcome a sharp conflict with the Conservatives.    Even before the war discontent found its strongest support in the agrar-ian policy which was responsible for the high price of provisions; it would be of enormous importance if the country were brought to believe that tho Prussian agrarians were no longer the dominant party in the State as they have been since the fall of Oaprivi; to oneok the reports which, whether true or not, are widely be-lieved, of profiteering by the industrial and commercial classes, they might turn to the military who, on this matter, are supposed to have a clean record.    If this cause of discontent can be met, then the danger of the sooial resolution will be greatly dimin-ished.It would be unwise to attach attention to the report that men such as Erzberger and Scheidemann have been personally making large profits out of the war;   on the other hand, there is a good deal of evidence that the confidence of the people in the integrity and competence of the bureaucracy has disappeared.
