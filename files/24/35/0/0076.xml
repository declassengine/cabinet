 yj ripDocument is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1917.ENTIAL.396mI CIRCULATE to the Cabinet a memorandum which has been drawn up in the Foreign Office together with a minute by Lord Hardinge. A. J. B.MEMORANDUM.IN view of the present possibilities it may perhaps be worth while to note certain changes affecting the question of a separate peace with Austria which have taken place since the memorandum of the lzth February was written. The situation has altered to our disadvantage in&apos; two main respects : 1. The collapse of Russia, bringing with it the necessity of the conclusion of anarmistice by Rumania. 2. The successful offensive against Italy.These two factors would seem to entail a stiffening of the Austrian terms, but there are various counteracting factors which tell in our favour. Before discussing the latter it would perhaps be well to consider certain general aspects of the Russian situation which may affect Allied policy in regard to Austria.Up to the present Russia has been looked upon as the great future barrier to German expansion towards the East and South-East. It seems unlikely that for many years to come Russia will be sufficiently strong or coherent to be capable of stemming the tide of German influence. The smaller Slav States cannot in the near future look to her as the protector against Teatonism. Is it not, therefore, advisable to turn elsewhere to find a bar against German expansion ? It may be that a reconstituted and liberalised Austrian Empire -would provide what the Allies desire.Count Karolyi, in recent conversations in Switzerland, has sketched out a scheme for an Austrian Empire consisting of five Sovereign States Austria proper, Austrian and Russian Poland (excluding German Poland), Hungary, Bohemia, and a Yugo-Slav State (including. Serbia). These States would be federated under the Hapsburg dynasty.If such a solution is really in the minds of Austrian and Hungarian statesmen, a strong and efficient barrier against German predominance in Mittel Europa would be constituted.Nor do the difficulties of such a scheme seem insuperable. The Serbian question may be the hardest to solve; but the idea of a fusion of Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Dalmatia, and Croatia, under the Hapsburgs, has long before the war attracted even the Serbians of Serbia, and this solution of the problem would have probably come to pass if the Archduke Franz Ferdinand had come to the throne. The Serbians of the Dual Monarchy are, on the whole, of a higher class, and on a higher intellectual level than the Serbs of Serbia. It would, therefore, be in the interest of all concerned that the future Yugo-Slav State should not owe its assistance to the latter, but should have complete autonomy under the nominal rule of the Hapsburgs. Apart from this the Serbs would be preserved for ever from the danger of Bulgarian attack.   Economically, too, they would have everything to gain and nothing to lose.It should not be impossible to arrange that the present Serbian dynasty should remain, and be placed somewhat in the same position towards the Emperor of Austria as the Kings of Bavaria and Saxony are towards the German Emperor.The Polish question, especially that of German Poland, presents perhaps a stumbling block. If, however, it were possible to induce Austria to make peace independently of Germany, the question of German Poland might well be reserved till the end of the Avar. If the Allies are sufficiently successful to impose their own terms on Germany, German Poland could well be added to Austrian and Russian Poland, Dantzig being made a free port. Such a solution is not unlikely to appeal to the Austrian Emperor, - r12581 .
whose dynasty have been distinguished in the past by the desire to extend their territory.The Hapsburg sway over their portion of Poland has always been mild and tolerant in striking contrast to that of Russia and Germany. The Austrian Poles have therefore been more or less contented and would presumably not hanker after a transfer of allegiance. During the ten years that Count Goluchowski controlled foreign affairs for the Dual Monarchy, the Poles managed to secure every form of concession, and were in many ways more favourably treated than thuse of other nationalities.The factors which tell in our favour at the present time in any negotiations with Austria are: 1. The food and economic position in the Dual Monarchy, which, from all accounts, is very serious.2. The growing desire of Austria to liberate herself, both as regards the present and the future, from the increasing control of Germany.3. The declaration of war by the United States, which we have been informed might even lead to a revolution in Austria.4. The Italian retreat, which may induce the Italians to be content with much less than they are strictly entitled to by the treaty made at the time of Italy&apos;s entry into the war. The Trentino with Triesie sis a free port may satisfy the aspirations of the larger part of the Italian nation, and it is probable that they would welcome peace on such terms.5. The present position of the Roumanian King and Government.From recent telegrams it appears that the Roumanians would be content if they could secure the territory formerly belonging to them. If they have to cede part of the Dobrudja to Bulgaria and it is very doubtful how far Austria will support Bulgarian aspirations compensation could well be found in the Bukovina and in that part of Bessarabia where the Roumanians form the majority of the inhabitants.If, therefore, negotiations for a separate peace with Austria can be entered into the balance would not seem to have altered greatly to our disadvantage, in spite of the present military situation in fact, the opposite may prove to be the case.ERIC DRUMMOND.Foreign Office, December 10, 1917.Minute.As stated above, the Serbian question will probably prove the most difficult to solve, but a solution should be possible even if that suggested by Count Karolyi proves inacceptable. A strong Austrian bloc is not necessarily antagonistic to a Balkan bloc, which might constitute still another barrier against German expansion eastwards.H.
