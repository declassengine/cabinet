Document is the Property ofShort Memorandum on the2481 JflBahifesto of the Bolshevik Government at Petrogradall the labouring Olass Moslems of Ruasia and the Orient.&quot;(Admiralty per wireless press, 18/5 CH.TSH. to? ; Serial Number 3173, December 6th 1917.)This manifesto falls into three parts:- (1) an account, fromthe Bolshevik point of view, of the Russian Revolution;   (2)   Anappeal to the ?*&apos;oslems of 1-ussia (mentioned in detail by localitiesand tribes) to&quot;support this Revolution and its plenipotentiarygovernmentand (3) an appeal to Moslems under the government orprotectorate of other European States to overthrow the existing re-gime.It is evidently intended to serve the following purposes (l) to discredit tha Kerensky regime in the eyes of the Kussian Moslems;   (2) to flatter the Russian Moslems by oalling for the liberation of Moslems all over the world, a point on which Moslems  v in Russia have, since the Revolution, been extremely sensitive;   and (3) to bring pressure upon the Allied Governments (for the Moslem populations subject to Germany, Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria are insignificant), by threatening them with a Pan-Islamic rising, in the hope that this may incline them towards an Immediate peace, (l)   Calumny against Kerensky.n&quot;7e declare that the secret treaties of the deposed Tsar con-cerning the annexation of Constantinople and confirmed by the de-posed Kerensky. are already torn in pieces and annihilated  - Con-stantinople must remain in the hands of Moslems.&quot;Cn the contrary, the repudiation of annexation in the case of Constantinople was one of the main points on which Kerensky came into power, in succession to the Cadets.    And the Russian Moslems, who
had previously worked with tho Cadets in internal politics, parted with them on this account and gave their support to Kerensky,The Russian Moslems accepted Kerensky!s programme of a Federal Russian Republic to be established by tho Constituent Assembly.   The Kazan Moslems were oontent with cultural autonomy;   the Baku Moslems wanted autonomy on a territorial basis.    The only Moslem opponents in Russia of the Kerensky regime were the fanatical reactionaries who have omened the democratic Moslem movement in the Khanate of Bokhara, and who demand the complete independence of Central Asia , This fanatical, and most anti-democratic, party will be encouraged and given wider influence by the Bolshevik Manifesto. ( )   A fictitious Revolt in India.&quot;Distant India, which has been oppressed during centuries by the civilised despoilers of Europe, has raised the banner of revolt, is organising its councils of deputies, is casting away from its shoulders the hated yoke, and is calling the peoples of the East to struggle for freedom.&quot; (3)   Incitement to a Pan-Islamic Rising.&quot;It is not Russia and her Revolutionary Government that support your enslavement under the European imperialistic despoilers, butthose who are fighting now for the partition of your countries.....,Cast away these despoilers and enslavers ......   Do not give themany longer your native homes for robbery.....You must be the lordsof your own country(4c)   &quot;No Annexation&quot; applied to Armenia.&quot;V/e declare that the Treaty concerning the partition of Turkey and the separation of Armenia from her io torn in pieces and dss-troyed.    V/hen the hostilities cease, the Armenians will have the right to decide upon their political future.&quot;This paragraph shows conclusively that the Bolsheviks are not
n   3   Msincere- about their own peaoe formula - that the^f hsro. merely put ,the-formula, forward as a means tb getting^peao^ lit any prioe, and not because Vtersr*3*-J&amp;&amp;^^ to secure self-determinationfor all nationalities.In bidding for the support of Islam they incite Moslems toVrevolt from Christian governments on.the principles of sel -deter-mination, and at the same time sanction the oppression of the Ar-^ menians by the Turks on the principle of &quot;No Annexations&quot; - for the Bolsheviks must be aware that. if Armenia is once handed back to Turkey, self-determination is out of the question.Incidentally, they hare a special reason for hostility towards the Armenians, beoause the Armenians in Russia, since tho devolution, have on the whole supported the Bourgeois parties.In conolusion, this manifesto is another indication of the ultimate Bolshevik policy, which is neither &quot;self-determination&quot; nor the &quot;status quo&quot; nor &quot;peace&quot;, but which exploits these formulae for a campaign of universal sabotage, designed to overthrow the existing order all over the world, as it has already been overthrown in Russia.lw *12 *17
