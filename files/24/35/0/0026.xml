TREATMENT. s ......- -**llt   Medical Referees.   The Committee of Selection for theappointment of Medical Referees held two further meetings and recommendations were made to the Minister for appoint-ments in Lancashire and the three Ridings of Yorkshire. These appointments have now been made and notified to Local Committees..A meeting of the Committee.of Selection for the appointment of Medical Referees in Scotland is being held to-day at Edinburgh.12.    Committee for the Survey of Institutional Accommodation in Great Britain.     The Committee recently appointed by the Minister which includes representatives of the principal departments concerned with the provision of institutional treatment, held its first meeting on the 5th instant.   The terms of reference to the Committee and a memorandum explaining the scope and suggested method of enquiry are given in Appendix VII,   The same Appendix contains also a report of the proceedings from which it will be seen that much of the material necessary for the Committee1s investigation is already in the possession of the Local Government Board and the Insurance Commissioners and this has been supplemented by the special information which has been obtained from the representatives of the Ministry and through the Local War Pensions Committees for the purpose of the arrangements to be made for treating disabled men.    The information thus collected will be summarised as rapidly as possible for a large number of typical counties sc as to enable the next meeting of the Committee, which will take place in a fortnight1s time, to arrive at a rough working standard of the needs of institutional accommodation and facilities for the treatment both of discharged men and ofthe
the civilian population.13. Deficiency of Hospital Accommodation for discharged men. The restriction of the use of military hospitals especially in the matter of in-patient treatment, which has become necessary in consequence of the pressure on accommodation by reason of the prolonged military operations has been referred to in a previous report.    Complaints have been received from certain Local Committees that accommodation in civil hospitals cannot be obtained to the extent sufficient to make up for the absence of treatment in military hospitals.    In order to enable the Minister to deal adquately with the situation thus created enquiry has been addressed to the various Local Committees asking them for information as to the classes of case, if any, for which they find difficulty in obtaining treatment and for other information which will enable the need, so far as it exists, to be met.14. Penalties for Breach of Discipline during treatment in institutions.   Representations have been made to the Minister from several quarters that great difficulty is experienced in preserving discipline among discharged disabled men during treatment in institutions.    The difficulty was materially greater when, as under the system in force before the Issue of the present instructions by the Ministry a man was entitled to draw his full pension. This has now been obviated by a system of allowances in lieu of pension by which a small amount of pocket money, usually 5/-.a week, is alone paid to the man during treatment.    The Minister has, however, considered it desirable to strengthen the hands of officers in charge of hospitals by penalising breaches of discipline by fine or reduction of the allowances otherv/ise payable to the man.In

Penalties for Breach of Discipline during treatment in institutions.   Representations have been made to the Minister from several quarters that great difficulty is experienced in preserving discipline among discharged disabled men during treatment in institutions.    The difficulty was materially greater when, as under the system in force before the Issue of the present instructions by the Ministry a man v/as entitled to draw his full pension. This has now been obviated by a system of allowances in lieu of pension by which a small amount of pocket money, usually 5/- a week, is alone paid to the man during treatment.   The Minister has, however, considered it desirable to strengthen the hands of officers in charge of hospitals by penalising breaches of discipline by fine or reduction of the allowances otherwise payable to the man.In
In civil hospitals serious breaches of discipline are normally punished by dismissal from the institution but in many cases, e.g., of wound or injury, it may be practically impossible to adopt this course without serious detriment to the man.    Further instructions have, therefore, been drawn up which will, vrith the Minister!s concurrence, be issued to Local Committees and to Superintendents of Institutions.   A copy of these Instructions is given in Appendix VIII.15.   Joint Committee on Institutional Treatment.   The Joint Committee of the Ministry and the Red Cross Society held their 32nd Meeting on the 6th instant.The Report of the proceedings of the Committee is given in Appendix   IX.It will be seen from the report that progress is being made with the Institutions in course of provision for Epilepsy and convalescent patients and men suffering from Neurasthenia. 16.    Treatment of Paraplegia.   A return is given in Appendix Xshowing the distribution of Paraplegic patients in hospitals and institutions on the 20th ultimo.    It will be seen that the cases are distributed over a large number of civil hospitals in addition to occupying the special accommodation at the Star and Garter Home Richmond, Lonsdale House in London and Ralston House near Edinburgh.The cases shown in this statement are those which have been admitted by direct arrangements of the Red Cross Society and do not include cases admitted.for treatment by the Local War Pensions Committees.
17.   Treatment of Tuberculosis.     It has been mentioned in previous reports from time to time that additional accomm^da-tion was being provided by the Ministry&apos; partly With the assist ance of the Red Cross Society for the treatment or advanced cases of tuberculosis.

Appendix XI gives the classification of the disabilities for which officers and men of both the Army and the Navy have been discharged, (a) during the month of November 1917, and (b) since the beginning of the war up to the end of November.19.     Treatment of Limbless Men.   Appendix XII gives the number of limbless men admitted or awaiting admission to limb.;fitting hospitals or otherwise dealt with up to the 31st October. It shows a total of 24,651 as against last-month1s total of 23,169 and a waiting list of 10,326 as against last month&apos;s figure of 9,618 - an increase of 708.     Up to the same date 8,977 artificial legs and 4,791 artificial arms or a total of 13,768 limbs had been supplied or were on order.   . During November the following numbers were admitted to and discharged from the various limb-fitting hospitals.Name of Hospital.                                 No.	admitted.

Prom its opening in June 1915 up to the 30th November, 1917, Dover House has fitted 493 officers with artificial limbs.     On the latter date 138 were undergoing treat-ment or were being otherwise looked after, 234 were on a watting list. : 8G5 officers cases were th$t&amp;-v  accounted for.- t - -&quot;&apos;w;20.     Treatment of the Blind.      The number of pensioners with injured eyesight, as shown fcy Appendix XI 33 is as follows-Army Warrant Officers, LCOls and men 6537Seamen and Marines. 972Army Officers 59Naval Officers. _247592Prom the beginning of the war to the end of November 843 totally blind soldiers and sailors have been admitted to the Blinded Soldiers and Sailors Hostel, St. Dunstanfs, Regents Park, and its annexes of whom 323 have passed through.     Of this number 285 have been fully trained and have set up for themselves and the remaining 38 owing to mental or physical disability&quot;have left without being set up.     26 men were admitted during November, 15 were discharged and at the end of the month there were 520 in residence.     105 in Hospital were to follow when fit to be discharged.With regard to blinded officers 15 are at present under instructions at St. Dunstan&apos;s, 23 have left and 14 are&apos; waiting in Hospital till they are fit for discharge. 21 *     Treatment -of the Deaf.   r,(1) In London.     During the past month the Special Aural Board for London examined 21 men and made recommendations as to treatment and lipreading (Appendix XIIj).     6 men who were already under instruction were examined and one was directed to discontinue lipreading so as to undergo treatment.     A number of visits were paid to the homes of disabled men reported&quot;deaf
deaf but in about half the cases the man had either left the address or was not at home;     wherever practicable an endeavour was made to induce the man to come for treatment or instruction in lipreading.       The day classes in lipreading contain 13 men, the night classes 18.     A common objection to joining a class is that a man cannot afford to give up his work as he cannot live even on the full pension of 27/6. In the London district the Board has the names and addresses of 381 deafened soldiers and sailors and in the country there are over a thousand.       The names and addresses of all the men have been apportioned into districts and sent to the Representative of the Ministry in. each Joint Area. (2) North West Area.     Out of 235 disabled men suffering from deafness within the areas of 12 local Committees in Lancashire and Westmorland called up for examination by the Special Aural Board 173 responded and were examined.     Out of this number 85 were found, to require treatment and 90 were recommended for instruction in lipreading.    74 men were back at their original occupation and 71 were doing work of some kind.     Those men who were doing no work numbeiedonly 27-.   It is noticeable that 79 out of the 173 men, or nearly one half, had suffered from aural trouble before enlisting. (Appendix XIV).(3)   Training in Lipreading.       A booklet has been issued by the Ministry with the object of interesting Local Committees in men whose disablement is deafness.       The booklet deprecates the congregation of deaf men in Homes and strongly advocates the teaching of lipreading (Appendix XIt* ).   As shown in the Intelligence Notes (attached to this report) plans are being made in the United States for teaching lipreading. 22.
&apos; 22. General^cheme^ Appendix XV. containsa report of the general schemes Of treatment submitted and sanctioned during the week.23.     i^njnbers^nder^r^Rtment-,     Appendix XVI. shows thenumber of men for whom treatment has been provided underarrangements made or approved by the Ministry and to whomallowances under Article 6 of the Royal Warrant are payable.iIt will bo seen that 355 cases were admitted for treatment during the week ended the 5th instant and that 3610 men were under treatment on that date, as compared with 3404 men at the end of the previous week.The Table shows also the nature of the disablements for which treatment was required, and it will be seen that over two-fifths cf the cases are of wounds or injuries, two per cent being cases cf paraplegia.     87 cases of neurasthenia are under treatment at Golders Green and 40 of advanced tuberculosis in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board in London.     The Number of discharged men in Lunatic asylums who have been   admitted to the benefit of the special arrangements for &quot;Service Patients&quot; referred %r, in previous reports was, on the 5th instant 1109,     Of those 93 had been admitted during the week.-ilmil^&apos;^1^ J^^9?Jr\G *&apos;3 *     During the month of November the Officers Treatment Branch has had under consideration 83 new cases in addition to 19 cases brought forward from October;   of these latter cases 8 have failed to reply to repeated communications and the remainder are under consider-ation,      Of the new cases 25 officers have been referred to Institutions for treatment, 6 have been granted attendant allowances, 15 have had their claims for Medical Expenses admitted either wholly or in part, 3 have had their appli-cat:-.ons for medical expenses refused as inadmissible whilst 34 cases are still being dealt with.An
An enquiry has been made into the cases of officers invalided for pulmonary tuberculosis and the arrangements which were previously made through the local Board for their admission into Sanatoria are now being made direct by the-Ministry.       The Kind Edward VII Sanatorium at Midhurst has arranged to take invalided officers at a charge of 2j guineas a week.     Of this sum lj guineas is deducted for maintenance from the officer&apos;s pension, which is raised to the highest rate, and 1 guinea is contributed by the Ministry.       Where the officer prefers to make his own arrangements with another sanatorium the Ministry contribute a guinea a week&apos;. Where an officer lives at home the Local Government Board, at the request cf the Ministry, are arranging fcr his examination by the local Tuberculosis Officer.   During the past month 5 officers have entered the Midhurst Sanatorium one has been admitted to Brompton Hospital for Consumptives and 5 have had grants made towards their medical expenses.The Director General of Medical Services has been approached with a view to arrangements for officers suffering from tropical diseases being made with tho Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.The Ministry have obtained from the Board of Control a list of suitable mental hospitals in wh ch ex-officers can be received as private patients at a charge generally of 2 guineas a week.     After deduction from pension of the i-e guineas for maintenance the Ministry contribute the balance.25*   Treatment of Nurses.     It has been reported that there is no suitable accommodation fcr invalid nurses in hospitals cr convalescent homes.     It is proposed tc invite the cc-operation cf the Red Cross in making provision through the Institutional Cpmmi 11e e.
Training^ and Employment^26.     Trade Advisory Committee.   Reports of the meetings of the Traae Advisory Committee held during the week ended5th December are contained in Appendix XVI.    -5hfl...... 4*a&amp;A*Furniture Trade.     The first meetings of the Local Technical advisory Committees have been held in London,-Edinburgh and Bath.     Lome difficulty is anticipated during the war with regard to work on Furniture subsequent to training in a Technical School, as so little furniture is being made.Engineering.     At a meeting of the Standing Committee it was agreed that Electrical Engineering is of too complex a nature to be fitted into the General Schemes for Engineering and a fuller report is to be made as to the possibilities of training disabled men in Electrical Engineering. Leather goods.     Complaints having been received from manufacturers indicating that men after commencing a course of training are inclined to give it up the Ministry cf Pensions are to be asked to sanction indentures of adult apprenticeship between disabled men and employers. 27.     Training in Forestry,Scotland.     In paragra h 19 of the Report for week ending 23rd Aovember reference was made to the training of disabled men in Forestry.      The Board of agriculture (Scotland) have now developed the scheme and have submitted an outline of the conditions under which men can be taken for training. It is anticipated that there will be a dearth or working Foresters and of technically qualified forest foremen after the 7ar, while an increased amount of planting will have to be carried out.      There would appear therefore, to be good permanent employment for trained men.     Appendix XVII which has been sent to all the Local Committee in Scotland gives a full outline of. the scheme.England
^Enpland and /axes..     The Office of &quot;oods and Forests have also been considering the question of training discharged disabled men in Forestry and there is every prospect of suitable arrangements being made.     It is hoped to commence with fifty selected men.     A preliminary training lasting about 3 months would be given on a woodland estate, followed by a year&apos;s course of training at the Forest of Dean (Gloucestershire) gr Ghcpweil Woods (Newcastle) Wooamen&apos;s School.     The prospects after training are good and the men would be employed in the Crown Forests and on private estates.28.     Training in Arrpj cultural Traction &quot;ork (England and Wales The Board of agriculture will require a large number of men in or before March 1918, who have received training in the mechanism of the Wotor Tractor and plough.     The work -jouid suit men suffering from the after effects of shell shock, neurasthenia, tuberculosis, etc., or men suffering from specific injuries, e.g., an artificial leg below the knee. The prospects of permanent work with private farmers is good. It is proposed that the -en should first receive training at a Technical School, to be followed by training in the working of the tractor and te plough.     The Board of Agriculture will lend a number of tractors and ploughs for use at training centres.     It is suggested that four training.centres should be established as soon as possible, one in or near London, one in the Midlands, one in the riest of England and one in Lancashire or Yorkshire.     bteps are being taken to arrange for suitable centres.     As&apos; shown in the Intelligence Notes (attached to this report) this subject is receiving attention in Germany.29*      Appreciation of Training by Expert.    k letter from the Secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Tailors and Taiiozesses is attached as Appendix XVIII. to indicate the opinion of an expert and an important personage in the tailoring trade upontha
thework done in the Tailcrfs Training School for Disabled Sailors and Soldiers At the London Polytechnic.     The letter is all the more valuable in that it confirms the view already held by those engaged in training disabled men that the latter are likely to :-aster many trades in a m.&apos;ch shorter period of time than the ordinary apprentice.     Testimony frcm such a source as to tho good work done by disabled men is very encouraging to the Ministry.30*     General Schemes of Training .     Appendix MIX gives particulars cf the schemes submitted er sanctioned during the week.     The schemes are ^ent by the Cdrmingham, Cardiff, Dublin, Hove, Luton, Nottingham and Soke of Peterborough Local and South West Scotland Joint Committees.31.     Individual cases of Training.     During the week 111 cases of training outside approved schemes were sanctioned compared with 81 cases during the previous week.     In. 133 cases further details have been asked for or modification of the original proposals suggested.32*     Traininr of ..&apos;ldows.   88   an -widows have, up to the 30th November applied for Training, an increase of 18 during the month.     16 applications have been rejected, 38 have been sanctioned, and the remaining 34 are under consideration.     In the case of the 38 widows whose applications have been sanctioned 6 widows have completed   their training, 15 are under training whilst 17 are awaiting training (/ppendix X1X4)/ sn. arrangement has been arrived ao with Madame Dudley (Court Dressmaker) 28, Sac-vilie Street, whereby widows of men who have fallen in the present aar can receive training either as Hand-knitters or r.achiae-knitters,   As regards Hand-knitt&amp;tfg. the work is all piecework and has the advantage for women with chilaren that it ca.  be done at home.     In the case of Machine-knitting, this occupation must be followed in the workshopitself
itself, and any widows whom the Ministry should send for train-ing would be given a commencing salary of 8/- a week during their apprenticeship.The Surrey County Nursing Association have offered to train widows on favourable terms either as Midwives or General NuaieBSv  paying a small salary and all the costs of training in those cases where the widow enters into an arrangement to serve under the Association.33.     Number of men under Training.   Appendix XX shows that 66 men were admitted to and 10 discharged from training by Local Committees during the week, and that the total number reported as under training at the end of the week is 1,009.
54    Training of Officers.     During the month of November 17 Officers applied for training and 31 were approached with the view to their being trained.     Three have been found unfitbeen advised as to employment, five are ineligible under the Regulations, and the oases of the resiainder are under consideration.The Board of Agrioulture having suggested a course of training in horticulture and fruit farming, 10 Officers who appeared likely to profit by the training were invited to undertake the course.     Of the number two have accepted the invitation, three have refused and five had not applied up to the end of November*     An advertisement of the particulars of the oourse in the PresB has so far elicited no response.During the month 62 applications for employment have reached the   Department and have been referred to the Professional Classes Bureau of the Ministry of L&amp;bctar.     Posts have been found for eight Officers.At present the provisions in the Royal Warrant with regard to the training of Officers are practically inoperative. The &quot;war Office are retaining in military service the great bulk of disabled Officers whose disability does not preolude theirm&amp;LX&amp;j^i including those who have lost limbs.     The majority of the remainder are either not in a fit physical state or are otherwise unsuitable for employment and practically there arefollowing their former employment who are desirous of being trained for a fresh oneefor work at present.Five did not require training and haveno retired   Offioers who are prevented by their disability from
Organisation.35        Reports of Inspectors.     Extracts from reports of Inspectors of Aooounts for the week ending 5th Deoember, are contained In Appendix XXI.    The Local Committee of the North Riding are having some difficulty with advances to Class W men but they are oommunioating.with the War Office;   the Sub-Committees in this area are reported as being well eon-trolled.     The Local Committee of the West Riding appear   to be going through a strenuous time but are just able to keep pace with the work and fortunately their subcommittees are in better working trim than previously;   in the same area Hotherham has fallen from its former good level, whilst Wakefield is highly spoken of.    In the North Sest area Stretford is free from its former irregularities;   Southport oontinues its good reoord but oomplains of the Pension Issue Office;   and the Rochdale Local Committee has increased its Staff and is able to cope with the work.     The Cheshire Committee, composed largely of voluntary workers, is spoken of in high terms and is recommended for a letter of appreciation, while Stockport also in the Cheshire Area, with 1,400 discharged men on the Register, expended on wages during the June quarter only  13.     In the South Wales Area theAberdare   Committee oomplains of being under-staffed and over-worked, evidently the re-organisation promised in a previous report has not yet taken place;   in Monmouthshire voluntary funds largely take the place of. payments t$ the Committee;   from Merthyr lydvill oomes the pleasant news that there is a good feeling between the -Disabled Men1a Association and the   Local Committee.In Scotland an effort is being made to put the affairs of the Dundee Local Committee on a better footing, whilst the District Committee ef Uddingston in Lanarkshire needs improvement.
y36.   Minister^ visit.     The Minister of tensions, accompanied &quot;by Major Evans, Private Secretary, visited Tyneside on Friday, the 30th November, for the purpose of opening the Dunsten Hill After-Care Home for Discharged Disabled Sailors and Soldiers.A large number of members of Local &quot;war Pensions Committees of the Northern Counties assembled to meet Mr. Hodge, The meeting was presided over by the Duke of Northumberland and others present included the Countess of Ravencworth, the Hon. J. Liddell, Col. Carr-Ellison, Major Gen* Ternan, Sir Thomas Oliver and Mr4 Clarence   Smith.This   Home has been placed at the disposal of the Northumberland Naval &amp; Military War Pensions Committee for five years by Colonel and iirst Carr-Ellison.     Accommodation has been provided for 4 0 patients hut this could oasily be extended to 60 or more should the need arise.     The Home has been admitting patients since September 16th 1917 and 26 disabled men are now under treatment.37,   Intelligence Notes.

An interesting experiment as to Municipal insurance is being made by Toronto.     The Municipality insures in the sum of  200&apos;   the life of every soldier who has volunteered for over-sea service, from his enlistment until death or six months after discharge.     The scheme is worked by the oity and not through Insurance offices and the liabilities are charged upon the tax-payers of the city.     Up to May 14, 1917,  186,000 had been paid out in death claims.,There Is a note of an article as to the training provided

There is a summary of a law providing for the increase of naval and military pensions in the cace of men who have lost two limbs or the sight of both eyes - in the case Of men the rate is raised from 975 francs to 1,200 francs a year.An interesting report on the working of the sanatorium for tuberculous   soldiers at Bligny is summarised.     It is noted that the number of men actually infected with tuberculosis for the first time in camp or trench appears to be few, but that in a large number of cases the strain of active service has awakened latent disease, it is also noted that the forms of tuberculosis during the war are more severe than in normal times.At Eantea a Municipal School for the treatment and training of disabled soldiers has been established, the income and expenditure of the school will be shown as part of the Municipal accounts,United States^,     A manual for the study of lip-reading is being prepared, and Societies in Boston and Now York are making plans to teach lip-reading to deafened soldiers whilst in hospital.

The reply of H.M.Treasury of the 3rd instant regarding the proposed new Regulations, Part I,.was considered. It was agreed to expand and define the term &quot;Exceptional Ciroumstances&quot; as desired by Their Lordships, and toaccept the condition that a schedule of oases dealt with under Regulation IV should be supplied.On paragraph 5 of the letter the Committee decided that the reasons which led them to adopt as maxima&apos;the rates of pension In the Royal Warrant should be set out fully and that the Minister of Pensions should be asked to press for sanction to   Regulation 11 as drafted.4.     The proposals made by the War Office regarding arrangements for payment of funeral expenses of men dying after discharge were approved subject to the Admiralty agreeing to similar arrangements in Naval cases.SPECIAL GRANTS COMMITTEE.
In the case of Mrs.McDonald whose husband was shot fordesertion after having been wounded and having suffered from shell-shock, it was decided to award the maximum allowance permissible under the existing Part I Regulations, viz.,82/6, and to represent to the Minister of Pensions that in the view of the   Committee the widow and children should be granted by the State the full pension which would have been granted under the Warrant.A letter from the Admiralty enclosing a copy of the Order dealing with&quot;allotments in Naval cases as affected by the new scheme for Naval and Military Pay was read.It was decided that where evidence of misconduct is obtained in the case of the wife of a serving man, even when the womanrs conduct apart from the lapse, is entirely satis-factory, that the husband ought to be informed.   It was further decided that the wife should be induced to inform her husband with a view to condonation and that the local Committee should be asked to support her appeal to him, and only on her refusal Should an official notification be sent..
APPENDIX VII.&apos;COMMITTEE FOR THE SURVEY OF INSTITUTIONAL ACCOMMODATION AND FACILITIES FOR TREATMENT IN GREAT BRITAIN.Terms of Reference.To ascertain the accommodation in civil and other hospitals and institutions (not being poor law institutions) for the treatment of side persons and the facilities available for medical and surgical treatment and care, other than that given by general practitioners, in Great Britain; to consider, regard being had both to the needs of disabled men discharged from naval or military service, and to those of the civilian population, the extent to which, fend the means by which, such accommodation and facilities should, if necessary, be increased; and to report thereon at an early date.
Committee for the Survey of Institutional Accommodation and Facilities fog Treatment in Great Britain.English Section.1.     Ob,ject Of Enquiry.Under the terms of Article 6 of the Royal &quot;arrant of the 29th March relating to the pensions of disabled men (and by the terms of similar Warrants dealing with officers and nurses) as well as by the provisions of the Naval and Military War Pensions Acts 1915-1917, the Minister of Pensions is under obligation to provide treatment for men discharged disabled from the Naval and Military Forces cf the Crown,     The Obligation thus created has no exact parallel in any other pub?ic Department.     The obligation to provide treatment of certain kinds resting upon the Local Government Board and the Insurance Commissioners is, in some respects analogous but in the case of these two Departments the obligation is limited tc certain specific forms of treatment cr particular diseases and does not as in the case of the Ministry cover all forms of treatment both institutional and other.The measure of the problem to be dealt with by the Ministry depends primarily, cf course, upon the number of dis-charged disabled men who may require treatment and this must In turn depend upon the length of the War and the nature of the Military operations carried out between now and its termination; but it is to be remembered that the Ministry will be responsible not only for the men who are discharged disabled during the peri Aid Of the War but also for the men who within, seven years after the termination cf the War may be. able to show that they have become incapacitated in consequence of War service (Article 9 of the Royal Warrant).     The number to be provided for, therefore, may well be substantial, but, whatever it amounts to, the salient feature of the problem of the discharged man is the fact that he is so distributed among the civil population at large that adequate treatment for him cannot be considered apart from the treatment of the civilian population.     In other wordst it would be unthinkable to attempt to provide for the treatment of the discharged men on any plan similar to that adopted by the War Office for the treatment of the serving soldier, anmely, by means of large central hospitals with subsidiary institutions In their ne ighbcurhood.But the treatment of the discharged disabled man is not merely an incident to the treatment of the civilian population, the necessities of his case are to a great extent an additional burden on the institutions and facilities for treatment which have done service for the civilian population under normal conditions,     Up to the present time the need has been met by the War Office and Admiralty who have allowed treatment to the discharged man to be given to a limited extent in military and auxiliary hospitals but, with the lengthening of the War and the consequent pressure on military accommodation the Ministry are now driven to use civil hospitals to a far greater extent than formerly.     In anycase, however, the bulk of the additionalmilitary
military aooomodation must be dissolved rapidly after the termination, of the War and the Minister is therefore profoundly concerned to see that civilian institutions and facilities for treatment are adequate to the additional burden that will be thrown upon them by the treatment of the discharged men.It is however the object of the present enquiry to ascertain not only whether the normal institutions and facilities for treatment are adequate but whether any of the special aocomodation provided for War purposes through the Red Cross Society and by private voluntary effort oan be usefully preserved.    It is common knowledge to the departments which havt been concerned with medical treatment that institutional aooomodation is seriously deficient in many parts of the oountry and, with the additional burden of the discharged disabled men, that deficiency must beoome accentuated unless it can be remedied.     It appeared to the Minister, and he was supported in his view by the Red Cross Society, that the additional accomodation provided in connection with the War should not be allowed to lapse until it had been clearly ascertained how much of it should be maintained in the interests of the discharged soldier and the civilian population. .     Scope of enquiry.It will be seen that the terms of reference have been so drawn as to cover investigation into the extent not only of institutional accommodation in the narrow sense but of all facilities for treatment, from out-patient treatment to nursing and health-visiting.    This is necessary for the immediate object, namely, the oomprehensive treatment of the discharged man, which the Minister has in view, but it will be no less important to take a comprehensive vi ew of treatment as a whole for the civilian population at large.    The only form of treatment which is excluded is that given by the general practitioner.     This, so far as it is an organised system, is in the hands of the Insurance Commissioners, and under the Insurance Acts, as amended, general practitioner treatment is fully secured for all discharged disabled men, whether insured or uninsured.    But everything beyond general practitioner treatment is within the scope of the present enquiry.The provision made by the Poor Law in workhouse infirmaries and otherwise is excluded in terms from the scope of the enquiry.     The question of the future of the poor law and its institutions is now under the consideration of a sub-oemmittee of the Reconstruction Committee,     The extent of this institutional accommodation, at any rate that provided in separate infirmaries, may, however, have to be considered incidentally in any given area as affording in certaincontingenoi es
contingencies a possible addition to hospital accommodation. 3.      Method of enquiry.The accommodation available and to be made available which &amp;s the subject matter of the present enquiry appears to be susceptible of division into four sections:-Section 1.     Public General Hospitals, ranging from the large general hospital, with full provision for surgical treatment, is the cottage hospital.     Sub-divisions of this section would be in-patient and out-patient treatment respectively, the latter inoluding treatment in special out-patient clinios.Section 2.     Specialised institutions, such as those for the treatment of tuberculosis, and ophthalmic, aural or throat hospitals, etc. &quot;Specialist&quot; treatment i3 of course given in many general hospitals, and so far as it is so, should perhaps fall to be considered under this section.Section 3.     Convalescent treatment.Section 4,     Home nursing, health-visiting, massage, etcFor each of these sections, if the classification commends itself to the Committee, it is suggested that it would be the task of the Committee.(a)   to determine the area and population which should be adopted as the basis of survey;(b j   to determine the standard of accommodation or provision which would be proper to the unit of area and population so adopted;(o)   to ascertain the institutions and facilities at present in existence;   and(d)   to review and suggest the means by which existing institutions and facilities can be supplemented so as, if possible and as nearly as possible, to comply with the standard agreed upon.Ministry of Pensions. December, 1917.
First Meeting of the Committee for the Survey of Institutional Accommodation and Facilities for Treatment.in Great Britain 5th December, 1917.Present.Sir A.G.Boscawen (Chairman)The Hon. Sir A. Stanley.Dr. Buchanan.Dr. J. Smith Witaker.Dr. Meredith Richards.Sir John CollieSir A. Pearce Gould.Sir George Bullock.Colonel Webb.Mr. C.F.A. Hore.1.     The Chairman in a brief opening statement drew attention to the terms of reference and the Memorandum which has been circulated to Members of the Committee and laid stress upon the fact that the provision of treatment for discharged men during and after the war was the Statutory obligation of the Ministry of Pensions.   The difficulty of finding the necessary accommodation was already great and was likely to become greater in the future.   The problem differed however  -from that v/hich had confronted the Military Authorities, in that the Ministry were being called on to provide facilities through-out the country as near as possible to the homes of discharged men.   It was, therefore, necessary to ascertain what accommodation actually existed in the various localities and how far deficiencies had to be made good..    He pointed out that the Ministry had already done much to supply increased accommodation for certain special classes of disablement such as paraplegia, neurasthenia and epilepsy, but more than this was necessary, and moreover, was necessary immediately In view of the restrictions now placed by the military authoritieson
An the use of military hospitals.   The present inquiry would therefore he of practical use for the immediate needs of the Ministry.   The larger question before the Committee was, how-ever, the treatment of the discharged man after the war&apos;.   From this point of view it was important to discover what institutions now used by the Military Authorities would not be required by them after demobilisation, and to what extent these institutions could be taken over for bhe use of discharged men.   Some institutions had been specially erected by the War Office and by the Red Cross Society and would obviously be suitable for permanent use, while others were private houses lent by the owners for the duration of the War and would, therefore, not be available.2,     A general discussion followed as to the material v already in existence for the purposes of the inquiry.   Mr. Hore stated that statements had been required of all Local Committees and Representatives of the Ministry as to the accommodation for both inpatient and outpatient treatment in civil and other hospitals in their areas and that such statements had now been very generally furnished.&apos; They contained classified information as to the special kind of treatment given in the institutions, as to the areas served by them and certain other Information. Dr. Smith Whitaker gave the Committee copies of statements which had been prepared by the National Health Insurance Commission, of the accommodation in all hospitals in England, including institutions belonging to Local Health Authorities.   Dr.. Buchanan on behalf of the Local Government Board explained the return as to hospital accommodation which had been brought out by that Department in 1916.    It was agreed that the combined information afforded valuable material for the Committee&apos;s purposes, bu hi  needed to be substantially supplemented.3.     With regard to the unit of area to be adopted for thepurpose
purpose of inquiry It was decided that the county should be the basis but that counties might be grouped in the areas of the Joint (Disablement) Committees or any other combination adopted that might appear suitable.   Dr. Smith WhItaker emphasised the fact that in many districts a particular town (e.g. Newcastle) was recognised locally as a centre for an area covering portions of several counties-4,&apos;     As to procedure it was suggested that the best plan would be to estimate the total number of discharged mon who would require treatment and so to arrive at the aggregate accommodation which would be necessary over and above the needs of the civil population.   The War Office had proceeded on this method In dealing with the problem of the serving soldier at   -the outset of the War,    It was agreed., however, that while this method suited the need of the War Office who were able to move men to wherever they&quot;might find it convenient to arrange centres of treatment, it was impracticable for the Ministry who had to treat the discharged man as near his own home as possible-.. Hence a detailed survey of hospital accommodation in the several localities was necessary-5,     With regard to the immediate object of inquiry it was agreed that the problem before the Committoe involved two distinct considerations, namely,(a) the immediate need of additional accommodation cr the discharged man created (apart from the fact cf theprolongation cf the war) by the recent restrictions placed by the War Office on the use of military hospitals for discharged men as well as by the absorption of a certain amount cf civil hospital accommodation by the military.(b) the ultimate and more permanent need in the same direction, in regard to which the requirements cf the discharged disabled soldier cculd net be separated frcm these cf the civilian population.-
(     6.     A discussion ensued as to the practicability of determining (as suggested in the memorandum submitted to the Committee) a standard unit of hospital accommodation for the civil population as the basis of inquiry.   It was agreed that it was not possible at the outset to determine a precise standard.    It would only be practicable to arrive at a conclusion as to the obvious deficiencies of accommodation in the several areas and so obtain by comparison a, relative working standard in respect of hospital accommodation for the needs both of   the discharged soldier and of the civilian population.7.    As a first step therefore it was resolved that a statement should be prepared to show the available accommoda-tion in all civil hospitals according to the class of treatment given or the special kind of case dealt with.   For this purpose it was left to Mr. Hore and the: representatives of the National Health Insurance Commission and of the Local Government Board to draw up a suitable form for the presentation of the informa-tion (or of so much of the.Information.as could be g^ven) in possession of the three Departments to the Committee at its next meetings.    . .8.     The date of the next meeting was fixed for Wednesday December 19th at 3.50 p.m. .

Haward recommending that the Ministry should write to the Treasury and endeavour to have the new scale altered.   The Committee had already agreed that the proposed new scale was inequitable, and could not be maintained.   In view of that, he considered that a further recommendation should be made to the Ministry that the letter to the Treasury on the above lines should be written at once.   It would open up the matter for dis-ouusion and a satisfactory arrangement might be oome to before it wat. too late.   The Committee resolved that this should be done.9.

GENERAL REPORT ijap QBSBRV-uTXOM.1.   Returns of all the results of the Special Aural BoardrS I&amp;ami nations have been made immediately after each Examination, to the various Local War Pensions Committees, on the Board*s form, whioh gives the aural diagnosis, and recommendations for treatment and education (Lip-Reading and Speeoh).2.   Out of the total number called up for Examination (235) there are only 27 out of employment.   Some of these are neuras-thenio and unfit for regular work at present.   It is recommended that local efforts should be made to secure wage-earning.employ-ment for the remainder, in preference to speoial training.   Special training presents great difficulties, and it has to be borne in mind that skilled handicraft trades are not easily acquired after mennhave reached the age, say, of 21.   The tactile sense has by that time become fixed, and does not readily respond to the acquirement of a new form of skill.   But the above observations do not mean that in cases where immediate wage-earning employment is impossible, no effort should be made to seeure training.   The nature of possible employment varies with the districts in which the men live.   Therefore no definite recommendation oan be made to meet this question of training.   Certain handicraft trades are, however, more easily and readily acquired than others, such as Boot and Shoe Repairing, Pressing for the Tailoring Trade, House Painting, Prenoh Polishing, and Gardening.   Then there is other less skilled work such as Portering, Timo Koeping, Mossenger work, Cleaning etc.These men who have so far not secured work, judging from my interviews with them, are the worst of the deaf cases resulting from the War.   They have most of them originally been amongst the weakest physically, and are now nerve shattered as well, and. often very depressed.   They need encouragement,   friendly interest will provide this, particularly if it gets them back to work, and assists in the reoovery of self-reliance and self-respect,.3.   The men returned as needing instruction in Lip-Reading (90) may generally be understood to be either totally deaf, or having very little or no useful hearing left.The Lip&quot;-Reading Classes already provided are not being well attended.   This is unfortunate, and may spring from two causes:-1st.   The lack of realisation on the part of the &apos;men of the great advantage accruing from the ability to lip-read.2nd.   The possible absence of pressure on the part of the Local Committees in regard to the necessity of attendance.   I do not say this is the case, I simply infer that the poor attendance may be due to these two causes, and the first is undoubtedly true.where a man Is totally deaf his efficiency as a worker is naturally lessened, unless he can learn to communicate.   Where men have some little &quot;useful hearing&quot; left that little, added to the ability to lip-read, will become &quot;very useful&quot;.4.   It will he noticed that there are 62 absentees from Bxami^i&amp;*&amp;Lon. This is unfortunate, and suggests a stronger appeal to the men to attend.   These absentees will be called up again after the whole of the lists have once teen gone through.
5*   It is to be noted that cut of the total number of men examined (173) 79 men were suffering cither from deafness or some form of aural trouble bofore enlisting.   Exposure under training, and at the Front, or heavy firing, at onoe aggravated either the deafness or aural trouble or both.   This point may be of Importance to the Recruiting Authorities in the future,(Sgd),      WILLIaM NELSON,Secretary. Special Aural Boards

respectively means. To acquire blindness or deafness after the blessing of sight or hearing has been enjoyed for many years is even a greater calamity in its effect on the spirit of men., than affliction from birth.Deafness coming on in adult life suddenly l&amp;cks the door to speech communication. It permanently takes away all the inspiration of sound music, the voices of friends, of the country in spring, and the great hum of busy cities. All is still and the world dead, except to sight.There is no class of disablement resulting from the War which is so likely to be overlooked as that of the man discharged from the Army because his hearing has been lost. His hands and limbs and eyes and general aptitude for manual work are as good as ever they were, but his deafness slows down or entirely prevents the rapid communication of business usage.It has been suggested that colonisation on similar lines to that wonderful institution, the St. Dunstan&apos;s Home for the Blinded Soldiers, should be carried out. But this is in many respects undesirable and unnecessary. The deafened soldier who gets back to his original work, or who even takes up some new suitable work, generally of the handicraft kind, is in no difficulty in regard to communicating with others, the difficulty is for others to communicate with him. They can do this by writing, by signing, and by speech. There is no reason why all three methods should not be used, but
speech is the normal method of everyday life, and lip&apos; reading makes it possible to all who cannot hear. The congregation of deaf men in Homes would neither be conducive to speech communication nor self reliance. It would tend to sap the power of self-hejip, and cut off association with the world at large.The ability to lip-read may soon be acquired by adults who become deaf. It is chiefly a question of practice and perserverance. The opportunity for practice at first is best secured in the home circle. After a certain facility has been gained it will become useful in connection with everyday work, and comparatively easy, as the phrases used in connection with particular forms of work will be generally more or less obvious, e.g., &quot; Give me that hammer,&quot; &quot; Shut the door,&quot; &quot; What time is it ? &quot; &quot; Are you ready ? &quot; etc. Workers in large mills, where the machinery deafens sound, can generally lip-read one another in such obvious phrases as the above.But this kind of lip-reading goes no further. It is not as efficient as the lip-reading of the orally taught and clever deaf boy or girl of 15 or 16 years of age, who can take down a piece of dictation, or reproduce a short story accurately.The adult person who acquires deafness should therefore, by constantly watching the lips of friends and fellow-workers, aim at a complete mastery of
lip-reading. it should be remembered, however, that lip-reading can never fully take the place of good hearing.   it has its definite limitations:         .1. two persons cannot be lip-read at once.2. A good light on the face of the person^speak-ing is a necessary condition, ^-/the deaf person must have his back to the window or light, and the speaker must face the window or light. after a time the deaf person generally contrives to get into a suitable position.i3. the totally deaf very generally become better lip-r.eaders than the partially deaf, as lip-reading depends on other means of speech communication being impossible. the partially deaf person relies on the little useful hearing that remains to him. even the very best teachers of lip-reading cannot lip-read themselves, because they are not obliged to, on account of their good hearing.4. the adult person who becomes deaf has not only to think of himself and his disability, but of the general public. if he can lip-read people quickly, he will spare them the trouble of writing or signing to him. in business there is not gener-ally time to write: people cannot be troubled with it. inability to lip-read therefore means ineffi-ciency, and what is very often worse isolation. friends at home may take the trouble to write, but outsiders will not.
The Deafened Sailor or Soldier who fully realises what is meant by the above remarks will no doubt at once say, &quot;What have I to do then?&quot; In the first place he should join a. class for lip-reading, and get a good general idea of what it means. The experienced teacher;will soon put him on his feet in regard to it, and the rest depends on himself, practice, and perse-verance. He starts out in an infinitely better position than the born deaf child, for he has heard and acquired speech and language.Now in regard to Speech. Speech is purely imita-tion. Children born and brought up in England hear English and speak English; children born and brought up in France speak French; children brought up in an English home in France speak both languages, because they hear both. Spoken language is not hereditary. Loss of hearing then has a serious effect on speech, because it takes away the originating speech impulse  hearing.So the deaf soldier naturally says, &quot;Shall I also lose my speech ? &quot; The answer is that if he learns to lip-read, and gets into the habit of watching speech, it is not likely. To keep up his speech he must give it exercise talk, read aloud from the newspaper to his family, etc.Total deafness coming on in adult life does not mean loss of speech, but a danger of it becoming weak and indistinct.   The dropping of the final consonants
in words is the most common form of trouble, e.g., ts, p&apos;s, d&apos;s, etc., etc., so that deaf people have constantly to be requested to speak up. If the power of well-voiced speech slips away it is difficult to get it back again. It should therefore be kept up, and in a short time a new sense will be developed a motor impression of sound, of the power or weakness of the voice. TKe born deaf child who is taught to speak and lip-read develops this sense.WILLIAM NELSON, Member Special Aural Board, Ministry of Pensions.[.Deafened Sailors and Soldiers who wish to have instruction in lip-reading should apply to the local War Pensions Committees.](13915).

APPENDIX XV Treatment Branch.Repcrt of schemes etc sanctioned during week ending       5. 12. 17. k___--; ^---he Lancashire Local Committee submitted a scheme for the treatment of men In their area.   Sanction was given to the use of the Hamilton Military Hospital, Auchtyfardle Red Cross Hospital, and the Caidergrove Auxiliary Hospital; and further enquiries have been made concerning several other institutions submitted. The question Of Convalescent treatment was also raised aid referred to the Ministers Representative for the area.   The facilities of the scheme for the Joint Area,, which includes the city of Glasgow will of course be required to complete this local scheme and the submission of the one for the wider area is being expedited.2*     The Smethwick Local Committee received sanction to use the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital Birmingham, the Birmingham and Midland Eye Hospital and the Birmingham and Midland Ear and Throat Hospital, at schedule rates.     These institutions will be incorporated in the scheme for the wider area of the Joint Area Committee.3,     Birmingham Local Committee applied for sanction to use the cotswold Convalescent Howe at schedule rates and this was accorded.4.     The Manor House Orthopaedic Hospital under the auspice: of the A115.es Hospital Benevolent Society has been approved for the treatment of pensioners at schedule rates.     The London Lonai Committee has been informed and the Ministers Representative for Essex and Middlesex requested to notify the Local Committees in his area cf this fact.5c     The use of the North Staffs Infirmary;has now been approved and the institution incorporated with the Staffordshire Local Committee :s scheme which has already be-an approved.Similarly the Cottesmore Auxiliary Hospital has been approved for the provision   of in and cut patient treatment at Schedule rates and incorporated with the Pembrokeshire scheme already approved.6.     The St. Hellen&apos;s Local Committee submitted m proposal to form a &quot;Glass for the purpose cf giving physical exercises to men whose disabilities require this form of trea^jeht,--. Further enquiries on the subject are being instituted by the Ministers Representative for the area.7.     The Wiltshire Local Committee invited the attention of theplinlstry to the lack of institutional accommodation in this area for the treatment of epileptics.     The M&amp;nisterfs Representative has been requested tn ascertain and furnish particulars of the cases In that area for which it has been impossible to provide treatment with a view to accommodating them in existing institutions pending a decision on;the matter by the Joint Institutional Committee.8.     The west Hartlepool Local Committee have brought to the notice of the Ministry the lack of institutional accom:.nod9-oian in their area,,   Their one Hospital provides very limited accommodation and cases requiring treatment have tJO be referred to the New castle or Sunderland Military.Hospitals,Similarly
Similarly the   Peebles Local Committee report that owing to the closing of the local war hospital and an auxiliary hospital difficulty is being experienced in providing adequate treatment for their discharged men.The facilities of the scheme for the Joint area will of course be utilized, and this scheme is being expedited but even then the question of travelling to or billeting near the hospital will arise.
Reports of Minister&apos;&apos;s Representatives.The Minister&apos;s Representative for the South Midlands area reports that Huntingdonshire has drawn the urgent attention of the Ministry to the great need of additional institutions for ex-service men who have loot their limbs in the war.   It would appear that two local cases who have been long awaiting admission to Roehampton are suffering In health owing to the delay and anxiety. The work of the Bedford Committee is proceeding satisfactorily.The Minister&apos;s Representative for South West Scotland reports that the working of the Stirlingshire Committee is un-satisfactory,    The Local Committee having delegated full powers to their Sub-Committees cease to take any interest in the work one sub-committee is reported to have refused to deal with any questions of treatment or training.   The Minister&apos;s Representative has however taken up the question and the matter has been satisfactorily adjusted.    Dumbartonshire and Ayrshire are also unsatisfactory but these Committees are under observation, and vd.ll be further reported on.   In Kirkcudbrightshire the referring of all cases to the Local Committee by the sub-committees appears to be -causing delay in providing treatment.   This will be remedied by fuller powers being given to the Sub-Committee.Argyllshire is further reported to be very difficult to work owing to the difficulty of communication and the lack of adequate institutional accommodation.   The Cottage Hospital in Oban, with 30 beds is the only institution available for the treatment of pensioners.   Two disabled soldiers and one disabled sailor have been co-operated on to the Greenock Local Committee which is working very satisfactorily.The Minister&apos;s Representative for Midland Ireland reports that though good work is being done by the County Wexford Committee,the
the present amount is beyond the powers of the present Secretary. County Galv/ay is reported to be apathetic.   Difficulty is experienced in getting a sufficient number of investigators but the Royal Irish Constabulary is to be approached with a view to the police doing the work temporarily.   No effort is made by this Committee to get into touch v/ith their disabled men and ascertain if they require further treatment.   This also applies to County Leitrim which is difficult to administer owing to the difficulties of communication.   The Minister&apos;s Representative is however deal-ing with the question in both Counties and hopes to adjust the matter at an early date.    County Rosecommon   seems to have only a vague idea of the work expected of a Local Committee and little or no money is being spent.    The Local Committee appear ignorant of the fact that disabled men could receive treatment and allow-ances.   The Minister&apos;s Representative has however impressed on the Local Committee the necessity of getting into touch with discharged men and ascertaining their requirements. County Meath is reported to be in a deplorably backward state.    The Ministers Representative attended the Committee meeting and pointed out that little work was being done and many cases requiring assistance   were not getting it.   He laid special stress on the duty of the Committee with regard to the provision of treatment.   The Secretary of County Kilkenny makes no pretence of undertaking the instructions and no effort is made to get irto touch with their discharged men.   The cases dealt with appear to be decided in a most haphazard manner but the Minister^ Representative has the matter In hand and the Committee will be reported upon later.    The whole work in County Louth is being done on very businesslike lines but difficulty is being ey^perienced in getting men to undergo treatment and stay in the hospital when they do.

Trade Advisory Committees and the Training of Disabled men. Report for week ending December 5th, 1917,.FURNITURE.     December 5th,It was reported that the first meeting of the Local Technical Advisory Committee had been held in London, Edinburgh and Bath. These meetings were attendedby representatives of the Loeal War Pensions Committee and the Local Education Authority and plans for establishing courses of technical training for disabled men In these towns are now under discussion.     The ohl&amp;f difficulty seems to be that there is so little furniture being made and it would seem as if men, after their training in the Technical School, would in many cases only be able to work at Munition Boxes etc. until the end of the War.ENDINEERINC.     November 29th.The standing Committee met several representatives who are concerned with Electrical Engineering.     It was agreed that Electrical Engineering was of too complex a nature to be fitted into the general scheme for engineering, and it was decided to ask the various Associations present to bring a fuller report to a later meeting with regard to the possibilities of training in Electrical Engineering. Schedules are to be prepared to define the processes that fiall under Electrical Engineering.LEATHER GOODS.     December 4th.Complaints were received from some of the manufacturers that men, after starting a course of training were inclined to give it up, thus wasting the time and teaching given by the employers. It was unanimously decided to ask the Ministry of Pensions to sanction an indenture of adiult apprenticeship being entered into between the disabled m*n and the employer.
BOARD QiP AGRICULTURE gOR SCOTLAND. FORESTRY TRAINING  OR DISCHARGED SOLDIERS AMD SAILORSAt the present time there is a dearth both of working Foresters and of technically qualified forest foremen, and after  \ the War this dearth will be emphasised by the increased amount of planting to be carried out.In order to meet the situation and to assist in pro-  -viding employment for discharged soldiers and sailors, the Board propose to find temporary situations in woodlands for men desirous of taking up forestry.Prom the men settled in this way the Board would in the course of a few months select those who gave evidence of special Interest and intelligence and would provide instruction of a more advanced character In order to fit them for the position of forest foremen.The Board have ascertained that proprietors of wood-lands, in many cases, are willing to make their woodlands and the services of their head foresters available for instructional purposes for men in the probationary class.   Thess men, in addition to obtaining general practical Instruction would receive such lectures and special theoretical courses of instruction as were found to be desirable.It is anticipated that after a few months of such training, the men would be able to find paid employment without 6-iffioulty.The superior men selected from the probationary class would be sent to training centres for completion of the necessary course, which might last a year or fifteen months.   The mainten-ance and instruction of the men of this class would be the subjeot of future arrangement with the Ministry of Pensions.In the meantime, the Looal Pensions Committees would be oonoerned only with the selection, and settlement of men of the probationary olass.   The men selected should have full use of their limbs and be capable of a oertain amount of rough work, but men of less physioal fitness who are likely to be useful as forest foremen, - in which position supervisory and clerical work are of more importanoo - would not be debarred from the Scheme.   All men should be able to walk some miles and ride a bicycle.Forestry work is probably most suitable for men suffer-ing from shell shook, gas poisoning, and other nerve strains and for men threatened with, or recovering from tuberculosis.If the Soheme meets with the approval of the Ministry cf Pensions and the Looal Pensions Committees, the Board would be glad to hear from the latter.A        ?f woodland proprietors in the area of each Oommittee  would be furnishedand a representative of the Board woulfl. oonfer with the Oommittee In regard to further Retails.(SgdJ   B.B.Grieg   .

APPENDIX   XVIII.   ,fatter from Secretary to the Amalgamated Society of Tailors and Tailoresses to the Director of the London Polytechnic Tailoring School.C-eneral Office, 415, Oxford Road. Manchester.November 21st.1917,I desire to thanri you for kindly allo?mng me to visit The Polytechnic Tailors Training School for Disabled Sailors and Soldiers.     As a member of a Technical Trade Committee mainly responsible for the Rules and Regulations governing this class or type of Training School, I was anxious to see your scheme or sys-tem together with the opinions and beliefs&apos;entertained, put to the tevst of practical working operation.     As a handi-craftsman trained in a rigid school and tested in some of the best v/est-enc firms, my considered opinion is that handi-craft Work, together with the result obtained exceed anticipation, and justify the con-diction that these men will be enabled to re-enter civil life capable and competent workmen:    a few of the reasons leading to this conclusion may be given.     The ages of the men under train-ing were diverse, ranging from 19 years of age to 45; their injuries were not similar and need not be described.      Their occupations were different; a. Gardner, a Hospital Attendant, a Motor-driver, a Barman, Porters and so on.If it had been desired to test the effective training possibilities of the School no better or wider selection could have been made,     For all practical purposes the testing con-ditions were complete.     On the other hand the work done was of a uniform quality and excellence; so much so that a plain state-ment of the results seen and carefully inspected induces incredu-lity.It is a traditional and accepted present day belief that from 5 to. 7 years&apos; apprenticeship is all too short a period within which to teach handi-craft tailoring; yet there are men in this school who after eight weeks training can make a pair of trousers complete from start to finish, by hand; side seams raised and either side stitched or back stitched, Side pockets, Hip pocket with flap, Hole and button.     The felling of the hand linings, the;tacking of the pockets, and holes in the fly, the side stitching of the fly, the cross stitching of the bottoms, all work-man-like and of finished appearance, and would &quot;pass&quot; cutters at log price.     Oddly enough the older men are showing the most adaptibility driven no doubt by the constant thought tbat a Yvife and children are awaiting their return..Little need be said about the methods of teaching; the ain     newest comer begins/back-stitching with white cotton; hegraduates to putting in holes, making hip pocket flaps complete, cross stitching, felling, serging, stoating, putting in pockets then trouser tops complete, extending a few inches below the fork, and after a few weeks the complete garment.     It is extraordinary the teaching is extensive and the men live up to their possibilities and responsibilities.     There is an atmosphere of cheerfulness and good, humour which one is accustomed to find in a Tailors workshop; the responsible teachers are skilled and experienced handicrafts-men of the artistic type; kindly tactful and full of &quot;practical sympathy for the men in their charge.
I fcave written a great deal more than I intended, and my only excuse is sincere admiration for the splended work you and your able staff of teachers are accomplishing for men who deserve from the Nation the best the Nation has to give.The pensions Committee are justified in going forward with this work, and it is to be hoped that other Training Centres will be equally fortunate in their adopted manner and method of teaching.With Best Wishes,Yours,(Sgd) T.A.Flynn.Secretary.Amalgamated Society of Tailors and Tailoresses.

APPENDIX ORGANIZATION BRANCH,Extracts from Reports of Inspectors for week ended 5th December 1917.STREJEORD IiOQAL COMMITTEE,The irregularities which the Inspector originally found in this Committee have now all ceased and grants are carefully made and the Regulations complied with.   Many case-papers examined and all found in order.CHESHIRE LOCAL COMMITTEE.There are ten voluntary workers aho administer Part II of the Regulations, acting as Enquiry Officers and Almoners. : The accounts are kept by the Treasurer who does the work voluntarily and supplies the Almoners with a sufficient sum of money weekly to work their respective cases.There are 259 discharged men on the books, only six of these are in receipt of payment and there are only six applioations for training, the reason being that the training depots are so far distant from the centres of habitation.The Inspector reports that the work is remarkably well done.   The District Committee consists of 33 members with 19 small Sub-Committees.    It is suggested by the Inspector that a letter of appreciation should be sent to this and other Committees who have done their work satisfactorily.S0PTHP05q? LOCAL COMMITTEE.A local fund of  500 nas been raised in this Local CommitteeTs area to deal with cases which do not come under the Regulations. A large number of case-papers examined and grants found to be in order. The recovery of advances is satisfactory but the Treasurer complains against the Baker Street administra-tion.ROCHDALE LOCAL COMMITTEE.The staff here has been increased and is now able to cope with the work.   The Regulations are strictly adhered to. Many case-papers examined and with one exception found to be in order,ROTHERHAM LOCAL COMMITTEE.Report by the Inspector not altogether satisfactory. Too much centralising of work in one manrs hands.   Case-papers are not indexed and the action taken is not endorsed on them. The Disablement Register is greatly in arrear.   There is little treatment or training.Dependants1 Pensions are considered generally satisfactory.   There are a few claims for Widows Alternative Pensions still outstanding.
t.WEST RIDING OF YORKSHIRE LOCAL COMMITTEE.Tho Sub-Committees are now much bettor controlled and the Looal Committee is working with the Inspector. All irregularities are at once put a stop to.   Some 2,000 men are discharged every month into this area and the Looal CommitteeTs adminiotrfttion is severely strained.   There ig difficulty in completing the Ministry1s finance forms owing to the dopletion of staSf for military purposes.   Many hundreds of claims for Alternative Pensions are pe^din^. This Committee is reported to be going through a strenuous timo but by means of extraordinary labours is Just managing to keep paoe with the work.NORTH RIDING OP YORKSHIRE LOCAL COMMITTEE.The Military Hospital in this area objects to giving a week^ notice before a man is discharged, they complain that it would interfere with the routine.   Many advances of 14/- on War Offioe account have been made to Class W. men and practically no recoveries have been roceived.   Paymasters write in that the manT8 acoount is closed.   The Local Committee is, however, coimminicating with the War Offioe, F.6.Braneh on the sub jeot.The Inspector reports a case where a gratuity grantei to a B0ldl$rrs widow who died shortly af^er her husband has been refused to&apos; her heirs.The Sub-Committees are well controlled and the consent of the Looal Committee has to be obtained for every grant made.WAKEPIELft LOCAL COMMITTEE.This is reported to be a very good Committee.   Cases are well watched and regularly reported on.    The accounts are in first-olass order.   Separation Allowance grants are -increasing steadily; they were, however, all found to be in order and adequately dealt with.LiNJJRKSHIRE LOCAL COMMITTEE.Hddingston District Committee,.,There is some improvement in the work of this District Committee but further improvement is still possible.MERTBYR TYDYIL LOCAL COMMITTEE.Total payments for the December Quarter 1915,  931 for the March Quarter 1917,  975.   The Secretary stated with reference to the Sub-Committees that some cf them went to one extreme and some to the other in dealing with the Regulations.A Medical Referee has been appointed and has limited his time for War Pensions work to Thursday afternoons and Sunday mornings.   These limits are not regarded as satisfactory.There are 988 men on the Disablement Register, which is^;.4;J9* is a g00d fe6li*S between the Disabled MenrSAssociation and the Committee.
rkMONMOUTHSHIRE LOCAL COMMITTEE..Substantial sums are being raised   in Monmouthshire for the benefit of the wives and dependants of men.who have joined the Army and Navy, hence payments are small,     A new Secretary has been appointed.AJBERDARE LOCAL COMMITTEE.Population 53,000.     The work of this Committee&apos;s area is entirely controlled by the Local Committee.      Records of finanoe and cases are badly in arrears, particulars are vague.

CANADA: MUNICIPAL INSURANCE flOR CANADIAN SOLDIERS.&quot;The Survey&quot; of 8th September last, notices a report recently made &quot;by a New York actuary, as to schemes of insurance for enlisted men in certain localities in Canada.The most interesting form of insurance for soldiers is that of Toronto3 where a special municipal bureau has been set up for this purpose-.   The municipality has protected every soldier who has volunteered for overseas service by a life insurance policy of $l7O00, the protection running from the day of enlistment until his death or six months after his discharge or&apos; resignation.    The amount of insurance so issued up to ivlay, 1917, was over 32 million dollars, while that issued by private companies in Toronto was only 10 million dollars.To meet the cost of this insurance Toronto has issued 02,000,000 of bonds for war purposes.   The charge of principal and interest on these bonds is a charge upon the general tax-payers of the city.It was at first arranged to do the work through the organized insurance companies but the mortality experience led the companies to decline to continue on the same basis so the city took ever the business itself.    It had paid ^930,000 in death claims up to May 14th, 1917c   The money was at first paid to the beneficiary in one sum, but it soon became evident that this was inadvisable.   An investigation of the circumstances of the dependent is now mads by a committee of officials3 which recommends how the payments shall be made*    In most cases the amount is paid in monthly instalments of $30, the city allowing interest at 4-gf0 on the unpaid balance,   In exceptional casks, where the beneficiary requires the principal sum to pay off or reduce a mortgage or to start a business the entire amount is paid at once.Other Canadian municipalities have bought policies from companies domiciled in the United States.   Different methods have been followed in distribution.    In some cases the proceeds have been payable at once to the beneficiaries without regard to their needs, in others the proceeds have been pooled and divided among these beneficiaries who needed the benefit.
CANADA; TRAINING OF DISABLED SOLDIERS.An article by Douglas G. McMurtrie, Acting Director of the Red Cross Institute for Crippled Soldiers and Sailors in iJnerioa, appeared in the Survey of the 3rd of November, 1917, with reference to the training of disabled soldiers in Canada.The writer considers that the clearest conception of the Canadian plan is gained by studying its working in some particular province and for this purpose he has chosen Alberta.   Many of the first enlistments in the Canadian expeditionary force came from this district and consequently many of the earlier cases of dis-ablement were received there.Disabled soldiers enlisted from South -alberta are sent to the Ogden Military Convalescent Hospital, near Calgary.   The building was originally an unused hotel which has been adapted for the purpose.   Here the men are under a certain amount of military discipline, and those who are not badly disabled are given an opportunity of attending courses of vocational training. For the disabled who are unable to return to their former calling informal courses of vocational re-education are arranged.   There is no compulsion on the men to join these classes, and those who avail themselves of the opportunity do so quite voluntarily.The courses arranged at the Ogden Hospital for indoor workers are -Commercial subjects:   the minimum course lasts six months; the object aimed at is to train men to keep books in retail businesses.English language:   for men of allied nationalities.Subjects for Civil Service examination:   appointments in the postal and revenue departments are reserved for disabled and discharged men.Carpentry:    elementary training in wood-work is given,   The men are allowed to take home any articles they make-There are also classes for mechanical drafting,For those whose disability make it desirable that they should be out of doors a poultry club and a gardening club have been formed,-   Each man has a garden plot of, , acre and he is free to dispose of his products. j^-iThe training provided at the Ogden Hospital can be taken voluntarily by any man at the Hospital, but ceases when the treatment is completed and the man is discharged.   He then comes more directly under the care of the district vocational officers.-ken who are so disabled as to be unable to resume their former occupation may be &quot;re-educated&quot; at the expense of the Military Hospital Commission.   The man is advised as to the best course to take,, and if he aecides to avail himself of the opport-unity his case is considered by the Disabled Soldiers Training Board, composed of the district vocational officer, the medical officer and a representative of the local employment organisation .dealing
dealing with the placement of discharged soldiers.   If on the reoowwndation of the Board the authorities at Ottawa give their sanction, the district vocational officer is instructed to carry-out the/oourse of training.   The informal oourse of training at the Ogden Hospital forms a preparatory stage to the general oourse of re-eduoation.The man may then be given his discharge from the Army and in place of military pay receive hAs pension and a vocational allowance,   Buring the period of training, the family separation allowance is continued.In choosing trades, the present and prospective employ-ment possibilities are considered, present abnormal conditions are discounted and the oholoe is related as far as possible to looal conditions.In this connection, Alberta is favourably situated. Just before tns war, a vocational survey of the provines had been taken, in or&amp;er to find out f-ihat. trained workers were most needed. It waa fortunate that the lcinu of work recuiared was just that for which disabled soldiers could be most profitably trained.All the re-eduoational training of an industrial ohare-ct^ sr is provided at the Provincial Institute of Technology and Art at Calgary which for the time ie given over entirely to the nee of disabled soldiers.   The men may live either at a military depot, at horns, or board out.The trades taught are various.   There are oourses in automobile meehanics, eleotrio power station work, railway or ociiiaieroial telegraphy, surveying, architectural drafting, manu-faoture and repair of artificial limbs, &amp;o,A special oourse for sanitary inspection is providedt It is intended for men who have some knowledge of sanitary con-struotion, plumbers, steam fitters, &amp;o. or elementary medical training.,    Those who take up the oourse are prepared for the certificate of the Hoyal Sanitary Institute.   Employment is usuaJLl^ found with munioipal authorities.Classes are also provided in mathematios, English and elementary Chemistry for those who are taking up any branch of work in whioa it would prove useful,Although, theoretically the l&amp;Llitary Hospitals Commission should bear the ooet of the training the Provincial authorities have voluntarily undertaken a large proportion of the expense.Although the work in Alberta is at present only in its early stages it has given promise of success.   The relations be-tween the vocational oifficers as we&amp;l as instructors and the men are very cordial,   por example, at She Institute of Technology and Art, a students1 council has been formed for the social and re-oreatlonal side.of the training, and with limited powers of self government.   The school management frequently asks the opinion of the council on matters in connection with the courses and its r^commandation are often adopted.   The vocational officers are in close touoh with the representatives of organised laboufc,Conferences
IllConferences are frequently arranged,with the trades unions and it has been agreed by the unions to allow the period &apos; of training to cgant towards apprenticeship in the particular * trade chosen.

AT BLIGNY.-The *Revue.d*Hygiene&quot; for June, 1917, contains an iTj&amp;w^Btlng report on the working of the sanatorium for tuberculcwa. soldiers at Rligny.This institution., which is attaohod to the Military Hospital&quot;pomixi-lg-oe Larrey, at Versailles) was the first sanatorium: to be set apart far the reception of tuberculous soldiers.     tt Was opened foi: this purpose at the beginning of. March 1915.   DrV Chrihardl, whonis in charge, had had long previous^ experience in the treatment of tuberculous patients.Soldiers suffering from any- form or degree 6&apos;f pulmorary tuberculosis,- or suspected, cases, are received in this hospital.   Between the 3rd March 1915,- and the 31st May 1917,8,029 patients had been received and 1,792 had&apos; left the&quot; sanatorium.- In the present circumstances it Is impossible for a military sanatorium to undertake in every case the prolonged treatment considered necessary for the complete recovery of tuberculous patients.     The work of the hospital is necessarily^ restricted to. (1Y observation of suspected cases and confir*matioii of diagnosisi (2) isolation of cases proved to be in an infectious condition; (3) treatment of patlentb susceptible of improvement within a short period; and (4) education Of patientj in methods of preventing, -infection.Tie &quot;perioci l&apos;0j    Mich patients remain in the sanatorium varies considerably: it Is seldom loss than three months.    CaseB in which roturn to the army is clearly impossible- are passed on to a sanitary statien for further treatment as soon as arrangements can be made.     Exceptions are made- in the cases of men not fit to be moved; men who come from the invaded districtsand. those who have no home or no means of Bubsisl^ence.Some interesting&apos; figures, are. given with- regard to the first 1,500 patients received in the hospital.-They were grouped according to age as follows:-Under 20 years of age 7421 25 &quot; 33626 30 &quot; 35831 35 &quot;   &apos; 29136 40 &quot; 24741 45 &quot;              -     , 168Over- 45 &quot; 261,500863 of the men had served at the front for periods varying from 6 months to 2 years, vrhile 657 had never&apos; left the base;:of these 110, or: 7 per cent had rendered no&quot; military service at all.The
The number of individuals actually infected with tuberculosis for the first time in camp $r. trench appears to be few; but in a large number of cases latent disease ha a been re-awakened by the fatigues and hardships of life on active ,.ervice .Of the 1,500 patients under review, 40 per cent were certainly, and 2% per cent probably, tubercular before mobilisation; 15 per cent were doubtful cases; and in 23 per cent there was nb previous history of disease.Patients are received in all stages of pulmonary disease, from the lightest to the most severe forms.     borne of them have previously been passed from one military hospital to anotier and arrive at Bligny in the last stage of the disease, dying a short time after entry.grouped according to the character and extent of the pulmonary lesions,&apos;*the 1,500 mon may be thus dividod:-In the first stage of the disease In the second &quot;In the third &quot;54 per cent. 19       &quot; 47       &quot;In 1JB7 cases the presence of the tuberculosis bacillus was not confirmed after careful observation.Of the 1,500 patients under review 1,490 have loft the sanatorium under the following conditions:-returned to their unit      ....   ....      . *.    ...bent -to other hospitals or sanitary stations.

During the later months of 1916 and the early months of 1917 there was a marked increase in the number of cases of advanced phthisis.     The number of deaths during the first year was 53; during the second year 46; but in the three month;: from the 1st of march to the 31st of hay 1917. there were no leas than 40 deaths out of a total of 235-2(*0 patients.     The complications.am^ng the phthisical cases have been exceptionally grave.    Of the 13!-: patients who have died in the sanatorium with pulmonary local tuberculosis, 39 had severe laryngitis, &quot;r&quot; enteritis or enteroperitonitis,-. and 7 peritonitis.     17 meningitis,   kany cases exhibited,more or less serious complications, necessitating special treatment, such as abscesses, otitis, adenitis,, etc.30 diedtithlaryngitis
Franc.es Municipal School for Treatment and Training at. Mantes, (From the &quot;Revue Municipal&quot; October, 1917)A municipal school for the functional and vocational training of men disabled &apos;vr invalided by the war has been set up at Nantes.,     An educational expert is In charge assisted by a doctor s-f medicine.     An advisory committee has been appointed, with the General in command of the district as president and representatives of the military medical service and of the municipality as members.The income and expenditure of the school will be shown as part of the municipal accounts.     The municipal oounoil will vote separate sums for the purpose of carrying on the school,      A certain proportion of the income will be derived from state grants, and it is anticipated&apos;that the sale of patients&apos; work will add to the revenue,.
U.S. America:   Care of;deafened soldiers.In the &quot;Survey&quot; of the Sth of September,, 1917, it is stated that the Volta Bureau of Washington, through its magazine &quot;The Volta Review&quot;, is giving puplicity to the need of making provision for the instruction of deafened soldiers * A manual for the study of lip-reading is being preparedcThe Reconstruction Service of the Industrial Union for the Deaf of Boston and the New York League for the Hard of Hearing are working on similar lines.     These organisations are making plans to teach lip-reacEing to deafened soldiers while the men are still in hospital, and urging upon various educational institutions the need of arranging vocational -training courses for the deaf* .   Meeting places for recreation are also to be provided for, as the deaf are apt to become depressed for want of social, intercourse^
GERMANY: Treatment of Soldiers suffering from wounds in the head,&quot;Die Kriegsbeseha&amp;igtenfursorge&quot;, the organ of the Imperial Committee for the care of the Disabled, for May-June, 1917, contains a series of papers on the special treatment of man suffering from wounds in the head,     The work done in Berlin, Hamburg, Cologne, Frankfort, Dusseldorf and Konigsberg, is described.There have been a. large number&apos; of these cases since the beginning or4 the war .     Unlike the blind or mutilated they are unable to $0 out and mingle With the public, and they do not therefore excite much sympathy.Wounds in the head often result in loss of speech, hearing, or sight, loss of use of the limbs, partial or complete loss of understanding and memory; in many cases men have lost the power of reckoning, and of reading or writing.There was at first a widespread notion that little could be done to improve the mental and physical condition of such men, but it has been found that by long and patient teach-ing their faculties can be at least partially restored.     A number of experts are now giving attention to the subject.One of the first physicians in Germany to arrange special treatment for these cases was Dr.Poppelreuter, a nerve specialist of Cologne, who with several colleagues began work in this direction early in 1915.     He came to the conclusion that it was possible by combining elementary instruction with manual work to effect a considerable improvement in these men. He therefore set up schools.and workshops in the hospital.under his control, and engaged teachers who had been trained in the schools for the mentally deficient.Each case taken in at this hospital is examined by a-nerve specialist and carefully tested as to strength, endurance, -ability to stoop, knowledge, powers of observation, concentration, etc, before any instruction is given.     Manual exercises form a large part of the curriculum.     The hospital had up to May,1917, treated over 800 cases of men wounded in the head.Dr. Poppelreuter believes that while a great deal can be done for these cases with suitable instruction and training, complete cure can very seldon be looked for, and that in after years these men will be liable to epilepsy and other forms of ill-health.     He urges therefore that all discharged men should be kept under continual observation and that special institutions in which they could be received when necessary should be kept up for years after demobilisation.The hospital at Frankfort on the Main, under the direction of Dr. Goldstein, is conducted on the same principles as Dr. Poppelreuter&apos;s at Cologne..     Provision is made for 80 patients.     The director considers it the special task of the hospital to prepare for the after dangers that may befall the men as a consequence of their wounds, for example, renewed festering of the wound, epilepsy-, sudden death, and to make a special study of the dangers that a man is likely to meet withinevery
everty kind of employment,     He deplores the fact that it is im-possible to keep the patients long enough;   they remain a year or more, hut they cannot he kept until it is certain that there is no danger of a relapse or of the Occurrence of some later result -of the injury.At Hamburg the most modern of the schools for tfche mentally deficient has been turned Into a military hospital for men suffering from head wounds.   A special feature   in this hospital is the size of the wards, each of which holds only 7 beds, the cases being so selected that in each room there is as much variety as^safeible in the nature of the disablement: the objects of this   arrangement are that a patient may not be continually reminded of his condition by looking at others in the same plight as himself, and that one man may help another to dress^ undress, etcThere is a hospital School at Konigsberg on much the same lines as the Hamburg school; a special feature of the regime is a weekly conference between doctor, teacher, manual instructor and nurse to discuss the condition, progress and future of each patient.Dr.Perltz, of the Berlin Hospital for Head Wounds, emphasizes the impotence of continual observation to discover for what employment each man will/be DeaVsuYt^d&quot;; The instruction; of the men at this hospital is In the hands *f teachers from the institutions for the mentally deficient, but any men who are fit are sent to the trade schools in the town to learn engineering, carpentry, building, etc, ;Experience has taught the doctors at this hospital that the men must not   be sent to any work which involves too much noise or which requires much stooping.There aTe varied opinions in Germany as to the advis-ability of influencing men who have been wounded in the head to take up agricultural work.      The Berlin Hospital authorities advise itin the cases of married men, whose wives and children can help them but outdoor work means very often unfavourable climatic conditions; the continual standing and stooping affect the head and bring on giddiness; and also the men themselves have frequently no in-clination for the work.Many of the hospitals, however, have acquired   a piece of land where the men receive instruction in horticulture and agriculture and those who show any aptitude for the work ere given opportunity to take it up when they are discharged.The directors of all these hospitals agree in emjph-sising the necessity of co-o eration between the Provincial Committees for the care of the Disabled and the military hospitals, since the ultirjote restoration of a man to health depends much on the nature of his employment,     It is seldom that men are absolutely incapable of work, but in very few cases can they work in such a way as to compete with normal workmen.Several writers refer to the danger of leaving these men to sentimental private philanthropy and of destroying their independence of character by gifts of money; they strongly advise that care should be taken to provide those who can work with suit-able employment under healthy conditions and to-place those who are friendless and incurable in suitable homes.From
From other information it appears that early in 1917 a movement v;as set on foot in Berlin by Professor Von Cranach and others to collect funds for setting up institutions such as those described above in every,German state, so that all men-wounded in the head might receive special treatment and training-    It was proposed that each state should collect for its own area and that as soon as means were sufficient a central organisation should be set up which would assist all the state organisations by providing teachers, plans for workshops, agricultural colonies, etc.There appears to have been a certain amount of response to this appeal.   On the other hand objections have been raised to the collection of large sums of money for this purpose;   it is argued that the responsibility of caring forhhis class of men should fall upon public funds and that the provision of the expensive and lengthy treatment which such cases require should not be left to private charity.

The Training of Disabled Soldiers as Motor Plough Drivers.

The extensive use during the war of machinery, especially of motor ploughs, in agriculture, has given rise to a great demand for trained motor-plough drivers. The Zeitschrift dos Vereins Deutscher Ingenieure of September 1st, in discussing this problem writes: The transference of motor-drivers or of factory workers to the land is inadvisable, as these do not understand sufficient of agriculture, and for the most part would not be willing to stay in tho country. It has therefore been suggested to train for this purpose disabled soldiers who were before the war engaged in agriculture. The most likely would be those injured in the leg, provided that the right leg is still strong enough? for pressing the pedal; those, too, who have been injured only in one hand or arm could for the most part still be made use of.

It would be best to train disabled soldiers of this kind as general agricultural engineers, so that they should be able to keep all agricultural machinery in fit condition and execute slight repairs. Such work could be carried out in that part of the year not taken up with ploughing.

For the training of agricultural machine drivers the repairing workshops for such machinery would be very suitable. Here the newcomers could be engaged for eight weeks, during which period they could show their capacities for such work. After that could begin the proper training in motor-plough driving, which would best be carried out actually in the fields. Every man should be handed over for three weeks to a competent farmer, and be employed first in assisting the driver, and later as driver himself. He would then have to be set to work in the workshop perhaps for another three weeks, at putting together the finer parts of the motor-plough.
