I3* 33DGUMEKT IS THB PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAHITIC, MAJESTYfS GOVERNMENT)   .$RET. &apos;----X 299? . WAR   GABIHET.TRANSFER OF BOARD OF TRADE. ORGANISATION FOR PURCHASE OF MEAT AITD CHEESE.(hepo^t &quot;by Lord Milner and; Lr. Barnes)In accordance with the decision at yesterday&apos;b Cabinet (\V.Ci 297; Minute 2) we have considered this question,  and have heard the views of the Secretary of State for War.  the Food Controller,  Sir Thomas Lackenzie and the Board of Trade,The Food Controller1s claim for transfer is mainly based upon the plea that the existence of more than one buyer of the commodities in question must result in competition   and consequent rise of prices.   While admitting the justice of this principle we do not think that there will in fact be any infringement of it under the system hereinafter proposed.    The governing factor in this connection is that contracts have already been arranged on behalf of the War Office for the purchase of meat in Australasia and South America for the period of the war and for thJ&apos;3e months after.    AH danger of competition is, therefore,  already precluded in this area.    The only market in which competition could conceivably arise is that of Horth America.   The Secretary of State for War, however, has stated that he is willing to undertake that no purchases     should be made in this market except through the Food Controller.   The War Office are also prepared to hand over the purchase of cheese to the Food Controller with the sole stipulation that he should give the necessary priority to the needs of the Army.We are of opinion that this arrangement should be satisfactory to both parties and recommend its adoption.(Initialled)        M.13/12/1917 .
