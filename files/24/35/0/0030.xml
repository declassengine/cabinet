Oolonel him,Telegrams; &quot;SHIPMINDER, VIC, LONDON.Instant, I am directed by the Shipping Controller to reportfor the information of the War Cabinet as follows :-CONVOYS.(a)   Homeward bound Convoys.   Since the last report,9 convoys, consisting of 112 ships (792,800 tons deadweight) have arrived.     There were 6 casualties due to enemy action. Three ships were sunk in convoy, viz:- s/s &quot;KAREMA&quot; out of the Eastern Mediterranean first convoy, was &quot;torpedoed and sunk off Oran, North African coast.     The s/s &quot;MOLESEY&quot; out of H.M.S.. &quot;SENECA&quot; Gibraltar convoy, struck a mine in the Channel and sunk, and the s/s &quot;ORIFLAME&quot;, out of H.M.S.  &quot;CHATTANOGA&quot; convoy, struck a mine and was   afterwards accidentally set on fire by-her own distress rocket.     Three ships were sunk after dispersal of their respective convoys, viz:-.the s/s &quot;APAPA&quot; out of H.M.S. &quot;KILDONAN CASTLE&quot; convoy from West Africa v/as   torpedoed and sunk off Holyhead, and the s/s &quot;RYDAL HALL&quot;    and- s/s &quot;EUPHORBIA&quot;, out of&quot; H..M.-S.. &quot;ALMANZORA11 were both torpedoed and sunk off Beachy Head.     In addition to the above mentioned casualties, the s/s &quot;KALIBIA&quot; dropped out of H.M.S. &quot;SACHEM&quot; convoy, put into Palmouth and was afterwards torpedoed en route to Brest.     The s/s &quot;DROT&quot;, bound for La Pallice also   dropped out of the s/s &quot;SACHEM^&quot; convoy, and was   eventually torpedoed in the Bristol Channel.     The s/s &quot;SOBRAL&quot;   dropped out of the &quot;ALMANZORA&quot; convoy Secretary, fromWar Cabinet- .
from Dakar on the first day out and was sunk by gunfire and bombs South East of the Azores.     There are no casualties by marine peril.     There are now on passage home 17 convoys, con-sis ting of 238 ships.(b)     Outward bound Convoys,    Since the last report 9 convoys, consisting of 95 ships (627,900 tons deadweight) have been escorted through the danger zone.     There were no casualties due to enemy action, but the s/s &quot;CRENELLA&quot; out of^Queenstown convoy, was torpedoed and towed into Queenstown;    and the s/s &quot;MARIE SUZANNE&quot; out of a Milford convoy was attacked by a submarine.     There was one casuality due to marine peril, namely the s/s &quot;BILBSTER&quot; was sunk after collision with the 111. ALBURN&quot; which has arrived at Cadiz. There are now in the danger zone 6 convoys, consisting of 101 ships * -A statement is enclosed showing the number of convoys,-streamers and tonnage convoyed to the 1st December, 1917j   together with a statement showing separately the losses sustained by ships whilst actually in convoy. FINANCEDuring the week:.ended 1st December, payments for compensation for total loss in the case of requisitioned ships amounted to  1,086,588, making a total on this service of  34,509,608 paid since the 1st April, 1917. STANDARD STEAMERSThe following new ships have entered upon service s/s &quot;WAR CYPRESS&quot; built at Birkenhead and the &quot;WAR DAFFODIL,&quot; built on the Tyne.NEW TONNAGE -PURCHASED ABROADThe s/s &quot;WAR HELMET&quot; and &quot;WAR DANE&quot; built in Japan, have been delivered.. REQUISITIONED FOREIGN TONNAGEThe s/s &quot;LIVONICA&quot;, formerly Danish, was torpedoed and sunkon/
on the 3rd instant, and s/s l^ORGIQS, ANTIPPA&quot;, formerly Greek, was sunk on the 27th,November*Carriage of Oil Fuel in Double Bottoms of Liners and Cargo**Steamers,Since the last report on 17th November, 22 additional steamers have been fitted for above purpose and 18 are now fitting.A further 79,910 Tons of Oil have been loaded, making a total of 400,503 TonflA further 88.554 Tons of Oil have been delivered, making a total of 552,075 Tons*Since the last report no ship carrying Oil in Double Bottomshas been sunk*Vessels detained in the Baltic Since the last report regarding the removal of British ships there have been no further arrivals in this country, but the 3 British ships, 5700 Gross tons previously reported as having just arrived in Sweden, have now safely reached Christiania, and will be leaving with cargo for the United Kingdom within the next few days.     Three further British ships, 4457 Gross tons are now, according to the latest report, en route from Helsingfors to Swedish waters.Negotiations with the Owners for the removal of large Russian vessels have been completed in 7 cases, and it was hoped to move the first of these ships from Petrograd on December 5th. The latest report, however, indicates that the present Russian situation Is causing delay, but that every effort is being made to hasten the removal of these vessels.?Italian/
ITALIAN COAL SHIPMENTSThe total amount of coal shipped to Italy from the United Kingdom by all steamers (British, Allied and Neutral) during November was 303,000.     This is a drop of 238.000 tons from the previous month, and was due partly to the abnormally small amount of British tonnage available in the United Kingdom for the month, and partly to the diversion to America for wheat of Italian steamers normally employed on the coal trade.     So far this month there has been a gratifying increase in the British tonnage allocated to Italy - but it is impossible to judge at the present date how far the shipments for the whole month can be increased,FRENCH COAL SHIPMENTS The total quantity of coal shipped to French ports in November was 1,465,000 tons. &apos;   This may be regarded as very satisfactory, as the total coal requirements for French purposes are estimated by the French to be 3,250,000 tons per month, and it is estimated that they mine 2,000,000 tons per month.fiOAL FOR MALTA-It has been arranged with the Admiralty to guarantee the whole of the coal requirements for the Island of Malta intBritish requisitioned ships in view of the Island being so largely----- -    &apos; &apos;engaged in Government or semi-Government work,ADEN, PERIM AND DJIBOUTI The bunker firms at the above ports have pooled their requirements, and the Shipping Controller has agreed to guarantee them sufficient tonnage to meet all needs.British Shipping in the White Sea On the 21st November frost set in very severely at Archangel necessitating very prompt action by Commodore Bevan, D.S.O., R.N., the Principal Naval Transport Officer, Archangel, in order to clear the ships then in port.At/
At this date there were .8 partly discharged British vessels in Archangel having on hoard approximately 15,000 tons of general cargo and 1,200 tons coal which were immediately got ready for sea and despatched.     In addition to the above, 17 other allied vessels in port on the 21st November have been safely got out.     The other vessels now in Archangel and the White Sea are 4 Russian vessels all of which it is hoped will be got to sea, one British vessel damaged and one Russian vessel damaged which must remain for the winter.A telegram has been received from Commodore Bevan in which he states:-(1)    that the indications! are that the control and direction of Russian ships are in the hands of the crews and labourers, the Governor and officials having very little authority.(2)     that the labour anticipating continued employment has made indignant protests to the Governor for allowing the ships to leave the port,(3)     that the adverse action of labour was forestalled by suddenness of departure arrangements.It will be seen, therefore, that Commodore Bevanfs prompt action was thoroughly justified, and the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty and the Shipping Controller have expressed to him their appreciation of what- he has done.Movement of Oilers as affected by the Convoy system:-The system has shown good results in the matter o  losses, and though considerable delays occur in awaiting convoys, the greater safety afforded balances the loss in time, and more ships left afloat.Every care is taken to eliminate unnecessary delays, and to ensure that vessels are used to the best possible advantage having regard to the convoy system.General/
GeneralDuring the last two months seven casualties have occurred to oilers - one sunk by mine, two damaged by mines, one sunk by mine or torpedo, two damaged by torpedoes, and one, struck a mine in the Channel where sh*3 went on fire and subsequently sunk.In the case of the vessels damaged by torpedo attack, both these vessels the &quot;SANNAZARIO&quot; and &quot;CRSNELLA&quot; were outward bound in ballast under convoy, these both reached port and are now repairing..Military Transport Mediterranean Line of Communication&quot;The Taranto is still closed and it is not known when it will be re-opened, CrosseChannel Leave ServiceApart from the two fast packet boats the construction of which is being accelerated in order thatthey may be put on the Cross-Channel service, arrangements are in hand to increase the leave service to Dover by an additional 1,000 men a day.transport of Stores fjgh the British Army in ItalyNo definite information is yet available as to the requirements of this Force, but one vessel has already arrived at Genoa with supplies, and arrangements are made for ten others to proceed there, of which three are already on their way from this country and two from the United States of America, Natives from South Africa.It has been arranged that in future only such natives shall be recruited in South Africa for Labour Companies, as  ire prepared to sign on for the duration of the War and six months therafter, This will do away with the necessity for repatriating these natives during the war, and will thus relieve the shipping situation to some extent,Shipping/
Shipping- tonnage on East African serviceIn view of the conclusion of the campaign...in German East Africa, arrangements  are now in progress for evacuating large numbers of troops from that country to .India and S*Africa and gradual release of the store ships on that service is anticipated.Hospital Ships on India-Basra ServiceIt has been arranged that two hospital ships shall be   v released from this service, and these are being offered to the American Government for use as Hospital ships^ in exchange for two cargo carriers of equivalent capacity. Coolie Labour PartiesThese are to continue at the rate of about 10,000 a month - a further demand on North Atlantic trooping space. Transport of American TroopsThe &quot;OLYMPIC&quot; and three large Russian transports have been offered to the American Government for the transport of American troops, but up to the present the offer has not been definitely accepted.     It appears doubtful whether the American Government will decide to use the Russian ships, but the report from this Departmentfs representative in America is that there are indications that the &quot;OLYMPIC&quot; will be accepted.for this service. Neutral TonnageThe agreement with Spain on lines explained in previous reports has now been signed.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant.
