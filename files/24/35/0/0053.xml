Meanwhile the*Ataman of the Terek Cossack has ordered his men to leave Caucasus front without communicating with Chief of Staff.     Turkish reply to local Government&apos;s proposed conditions- for armistice expected very shortly^ but Chief of Staff assured me no conditions would be accepted here which will be harmful to British interests.     I think our protest and that of Consuls has had some effect.* The Ataman ie the Chieftain.
