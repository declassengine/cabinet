rhio; Document is the, Property ofHis Britannic Majesty^ Government.;FEEDING OF OATS TO HORSES ENGAGED IN WINTER RAGING.Eemorandnin by the Food Controller.The Stewards of the National Hunt Committee have informed me that after consultation with .the Board of Trade and the Railway Executive. Committee they have arranged a limited number of steeple-chase fixtures and they ask me to permit the -issue of licences to allow horses engaged in these fixtures to receive a ration of oats. -      The ration asked for is 15 lbs. a day each for a number of horses not exceeding 500, and the period for which the ration would be required would not extend beyond the middle of April.       The feeding of oats to such horses except under licence is prohibited by the Horses Rationing Order (No. 2.) 1917.In my memorandum of November 22nd (G.T. 2744) I have already called the attention of- the ?/ar Cabinet to the very grave shortage of cereals with which we are threatened, and my view is that in the light of the facts there disclosec net a single pound, of oats should be allowed to racing horses.I believe that, irrespective of the actual quantity of oats at stake, the effect on the popularity of the Government, and on public opinion both in this and Allied countries, will be disastrous if the Government permits the consumption of oats by racing horses while at the same time calling upon the people to effect drastic economies in their diet.The matter is, however, one which I can only leave to the decision of the &apos;./ar Cabinet.-RHONDDAMinistry of Food,7th December 1917.
