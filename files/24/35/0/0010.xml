SECRET.His Britannic Maje.sty&apos;s Government.)MINISTRY   OF  FOOD.e^ort for Week ending Wednesday, December 5, 1917.PART L-ACTION TAKEN. Control of Supplies and Prtoes.Allied Requirements.-Lord Rhondda, accompanied by Mr. Wintour, Air. Beale, Mr. Yale, and Mr. Turner attended the Inter-Allied Conference held at Paris on the 30th ultimo and the 1st instant. The conferences generally were concerned with the co-ordination of the Allied resources, both military and economic, for the better prosecution of the war. Plenary conferences were attended by representatives of all the 18 nations represented, but the principal work was done by sub-committees on munitions, shipping, and food, at which the representatives only of the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and the United States were present unless others were specially invited.The following recommendations of the Wheat Executive, having regard to the shortage of breadstuffs, were accepted : (1) That the American Food Administration should make allocations, or other arrangements, in order that exports oil bread-stuffs grain from North America should not fall below 1,100,000 tons during each of the months of December, January, and February.(2) That, in one way or another, it should be made certain, before the end of the present month, that the entire exportable surplus of the Argentine wheat crop is secured for the European Allies, and not less than 1,500.000 tons of maize.(3) That the full power of the American Government should be applied to make arrangements for drying maize in sufficient quantities to make good, as far as possible, any deficiency in wheat shipments.Resolutions were also passed to the effect that (1) An Inter-Allied Scientific Committee should be formed, with two delegates from each of the four principal Allies, to examine from the scientific standpoint the food programmes of the Allies, and in agreement with the respective &quot; Executives,&quot; to propose to the Allied Governments any measures which it seemed to them useful to take. (2) An Inter-Allied Conference should sit at Paris to examine the situation of the different Allies as regards agricultural production, and to suggest all possible measures for increasing such production.The latter resolution was strongly pressed by Monsieur Clementel who expressed the view that, with the necessary machinery and fertilisers, a much greater increase of production could be obtained in France than w ould result from the ploughing up of grass lands in this country.Bacon, Hams, and Lard. An arrangement has now been made with the Treasury Avhereby the sum of -$15,000,000 has been allotted for the purchase of bacon, hams, and lard in the U.S.A. in December 1917, and January 1918. The question of finance for the purchases in Canada still awaits settlement.The position in regard to the distribution scheme of importers who also act as wholesalers has been settled after discussion. It is believed that the Regulations as now drafted will stop intertrading.Copies of the Distribution Scheme have been sent to Food Control Committees.The policy of giving doles to particular industrial areas where shortages are reported has been discussed. It has been decided not to allot more than one week&apos;s supply in any particular district until full inquiries have been made.Butter. The Butter Distribution Scheme has now begun to take effect and by the end of the first week in December (subject to delays of railway and transport) there should be a restricted supply of Government butter on sale throughout Great Britain at a maximum retail price of 2s. Qd. per lb. This price may be varied by the Food Controller from time to time.   The supply of butter will be seriously restrictedA.   (33)1531-1   Pk 1   70   12/17   E &amp; s A
for some time, but it is hoped that the scheme will ensure that all retail shops may-have at their disposal approximately their fair share of such supplies as are available each fortnight.A conference has been held at Dublin to discuss the position of Irish merchants under the Butter Distribution Scheme for Great Britain. It was . agreed that Irish Traders should have the option of acting as Importers under the following conditions: (a) That they would receive application forms from their 1916 customers in Great Britain.(&amp;) That they were resident or had an agent in Great Britain.(c) That they were not drawing exporters commission or any commission in a dual capacity.An additional 340 tons of butter has been purchased in the United States of America through the Inter-Allied Meat and Fats Executive Mission, at the price of 42^ cents per lb. f.a.s. in New York ; the total purchased in this way is now 500 tons. A scheme for margarine distribution on the same lines as those already adopted in the case of butter, is in preparation, and it is hoped that this may be put into working order without delay.,Cereals. The Manufacture of Flour and Bread Order (No. 2), 1917, embodies the directions relating to imported flour which were stated in last week&apos;s report.Coffee and Cocoa.-An Order has been made regulating retail prices of coffee and requiring all dealers to stock coffee at a price not exceeding Is. 6d. per lb. If a sufficient stock of coffee at that price is kept other coffee may be sold at prices not exceeding 2s. Gd. per lb.A Coffee Advisory Committee is being constituted.Dried Fruits.-A general licence under the Dried Fruits (Restriction) Orc&quot;er, 1917, has been issued authorising all persons, until further notice, to buy, pell, and deal in plums grown in France and packed in tins or bottles outside the United Kingdom.Meat. The constitution and rules of the London Wholesale Meat Supply Association, set up at the request of the Ministry of Food to ensure equal distribution throughout the metropolis, were adopted on 4th December by a meeting of wholesale meat traders at Butchers&apos; Hall, Smithfield.Milk. -The Food Controller has made an Order prohibiting the export of milk from Ireland between 10th December 1917 and 30th April 1918. The price of milk in Ireland is fixed at Is. M. per gallon to the producer, Is. Sd. per gallon to the consumer, or 2s. per gallon if delivered to the customers house. The Food Control Committee for Ireland is given power to vary these prices, to buy and sell milk, and arrange for its distribution, to give priority to any consumers or class of consumers, and to take steps towards securing the purity and cleanliness of milk. The Committee may also obtain full information from milk factories as to the quantity of milk received or dealt with.Oils and Fats. The position with regard to the import of oil seeds and oils remains unchanged ; the freight room required for them has not yet been allocated to this sectiou, and consequently several negotiations are awaiting conclusion.It is intended to purchase linseed in the Plate in order to relieve the position, if it is found possible to make the necessary financial arrangements. *The Food Controller has made an Order requisitioning all oilseeds, nuts and kernels in the United Kingdom ; these will be released to manufacturers at prices adjusted in such a way as to leave a margin between the net cost of a ton of naked seed ex ship or rail at the point of delivery, and the selling price of the resultant products net naked in bulk at &quot;the mill.By the Oils, Oil Cakes and Meals (Requisition) Order, 1917, dated 28th November 1917, the Food Controller has also taken power to dispose of all crude oils, oilcakes, meals and residues which crushers may have had in stock on 30th November 1917, or may produce in their factories after that date.Instructions have been issued to refiners that margarine manufacturers should be given preference in the supplies of oils suitable for margarine purposes, and that other trades should wait until their requirements have been fulfilled.Tea. Several appointments have been made for the work of distributing tea purchased by the Government, and various deputations have been received on this
subject. Mr. Pigott has visited the docks and warehouses at Liverpool and Manchester.Anew Orde^ has been drafted fixing the maximum price, for &quot;Degrade and &quot;free &quot; tea at 3s. Qd. per lb. from the 1st January 1918.Wines. The Intoxicating Liquor (Output and Delivery) Order, ]SFo. 4, 1917, dated 28th November 1917, provides that the following sub-clause shall be substituted for sub-clause (3) of clause 4 of the principal Order :- (3) Authority shall (except in cases where special directions are given by the Commissioners) be granted only to the persons to whom or on whose behalf wine or spirits were delivered duiing the year 1916, and so that the total amount of spirits delivered to a person during the year beginning on the First of April shall not exceed the amount delivered to that person during the year 1916, reduced by 50 percent.; and the total amount of wine delivered to a person during the half-year beginning on the First day of October 1917, or in any subsequent half-year, shall not exceed half the amount delivered to that person during the year 1916.On Tuesday, 4th December, Lord Rhondda received, a deputation of women from all parts of the country, headed by Mrs. Drummond, of the Women&apos;s Party. In introducing the deputation, Mrs. Drummond said, they had come to bring forward the necessity of compulsory rations. Every member of the deputation was a house-wife, and they were all unanimous in asking for compulsory rations.Lord Rhondda, who was accompanied by Mr. Beveridge, Captain Tallents, and Professcr Thompson, replying to the deputation, said that the decision whether there should be compulsory rationing or not did not finally rest with him. He would represent in the proper quarters the arguments they had put forward for compulsory rationing. He agreed very largely with what Mrs. Drummond and other speakers had said with regard to the importance in this great struggle of acting in such a way as to cause as little discontent as possible in the country. The importance of the economic position at home, and the proper distribution of food could not be exaggerated.Local Authorities.A conference of the Divisional Food Commissioners for Great Britain was opened at Grosvenor House on Wednesday, 5th December.The Treasury have acquiesced in a proposal made by the Food Controller that during 1918 members of Local Food Committees shall continue to be paid their reasonable expenses, provided these expenses are certified to be necessary by the Commissioner for the Division in which the Committees&apos; areas are situated.The Treasury have also approved of an arrangement whereby the regulations governing the payment of travelling expenses and compensation for loss of remu-nerative time of members of Food Control Committees may be deemed (under certain conditions) to apply to expenses incurred in attending conferences.Serious food shortage is reported from several Divisions; the position in the Birmingham, Reading;, Nottingham, and Home Counties Divisious, is stated to be dangerous. There was a stoppage of work at Coventry through the dearth of supplies, but work was resumed on the promise of increased provision. In this connection it is pointed out that as the great increase in population in certain localities adds to the difficulty of distribution, any re-adjustment must be based on present population, not upon past supplies.The list of sugar retailers, compiled from the returns obtained under the sugar distribution scheme, is now practically complete. The present figures are as follow : In Urban Districts 118,432=39 per 1,000 of the population. In Rural Districts 36,192=4 per 1,000 of the population.The quantity of sugar required for Institutions for the 24 weeks ending April 20, 1918, is stated to be 1J. 2,547 cwts., and for Caterers 120,174 cwts., for the same period.The number of certificates issued to Potato Retailers is reported to be 121,121, and to Wholesalers 15,566.The great scarcity cf farthings in certain Divisions is commented upon, and is considered to be a matter of moment to the poorer classes.   The Ministry have been
in correspondence with, the Royal Mint in the matter, and are empowered to refer banks to the Mint for a supply of farthings when required.Enforcement of Orders.Butter (Maximum Prices) Order, 1917. The Executive Officer of the Stepney Local Food Control Committee reported to the Ministry a deliberate scheme of contravention of this Order by a firm of provision merchants in the East End of London. Before effective action could be taken, arrangements had to be made for those retailers who were willing to give evidence against this firm with regard to the contraventions, to be secured as regards future supplies. All the parties are Jews. The Butter Section has arranged that another wholesaler shall supply the retailers whose names are submitted by the Stepney Local Food Committee. 2c Notices calling for returns have been issued to the firm in question, and proceedings will follow in due. course.The Divisional Food Commissioner for the Home Counties has reported a number of contraventions by large firms for prosecution to be undertaken direct from the Ministry.   The necessary 2g Notices have been sent to the firms indicated.Milk (Prices) Order. At Bridgwater Police Court a farmer was fined 501. and 51. 5s. costs for selling milk wholesale above the maximum price.Nine other cases are reported against different defendants for exceeding maximum prices, the fines imposed totalling 53L 18s. bUInstructions have been issued for proceedings to be taken in seven cases of contravention of this Order reported from Buckhurst Hill.Intoxicating Liquor (Output and Delivery) Order. Messrs. Wontner and Sons have applied for summonses in four cases, which will be heard shortly.Sugar Order. At Manchester Police Court, Isaac God man was fined 20L for unlawfully acquiring 144 lbs. of white sugar, and delivering 10 cwt. of sugar, without a permit, to an Italian ice cream maker.Food (Conditions of Sale) Order, 1917. A grocer was fined 501. at Cardiff Police Court for refusing sugar unless other articles of food were purchased.Meat (Maximum Prices) Order. M. Milborow was fined 50Z. at Lambeth Police Court for charging Is. 4d. per lb. for a shoulder of mutton when the maximum price fixed by the Local Food Control Committee was Is. &apos;6\d.Food Hoarding Order. At Dundee Police Court, John Sinclair was fined 101. for selling 440 lbs. of flour to one person.At Manchester Police Court, on November 29, John Aitkin was fined 10Z. for food hoarding, and Albert Kershaw was fined 10Z. for unlawfully supplying Aitkin with food for hoarding purposes. The articles recovered were 37 lbs. of sugar, 19 lbs. of beans, 66 tins of condensed milk, 28 lbs. of tea, and 21 large tins of salmon.Mrs. Annie Robinson, of Middlesbrough, was sentenced to three months hard labour for being in possession feloniously of 42J lbs. of tea, and 5 lbs. of sugar.At Camberley Police Court, George Henry Row was fined 20L for aiding and abetting Miss Ivy Close, of Camberley, by presenting her with butter and sugar.The Chief Constable of Warwick has been requested to take proceedings in two cases of sugar hoarding reported by him where the authority to search has resulted in information supporting prosecution.PART II.-SUMMARY OF FOOD POSITION.The low rate of imports which has prevailed during the past quarter and to which attention has been called on previous occasions is dealt with in the present report-While the cereal year began with stocks higher than they were in 1916, a feature particularly noticeable in the case of cereals, the effect of a low importation has shown itself in their rapid diminution. This may be illustrated by a comparison between the fall in the stocks of wheat in the present year. The stock on September 1st is reckoned as providing for 27 f weeks&apos; consumption at the rate of 550,000 quarters a week. On December 1st the stock provided for 21 f- weeks at the same rate. In other words, consumption for six weeks out of thirteen has been met out of stock. It should also&apos; be remembered that in the case of cereals part of the stock is on farms and so not subject to close supervision.
Imports.There was an improvement in imports last week. The total weight of the principal foods imported was 151,000 tons as compared with 121,000 tons the week before (Table A). Of cereals (including rice), 101,400 tons was received, 19,100 tons more than in the previous week ; this increase is due to the arrival of 35,000 tons of maize, of which the imports since September have been very low ; wheat and flour were 13,600 tons and barley 10,200 tons below the previous week, and oats 6,800 tons above.Only 1,035 tons of tea arrived.There were the usual fluctuations in meat, sugar and other commodities. It is more satisfactory to compare the totals over a number of weeks than to analyse the weekly movements. The following table in continuation of that given in the report for November 7th (p. 5) shows a comparison of the imports of the principal foods in four weekly periods from August 11th in 1917 and 1916. The last line shows the imports that were estimated on September 1st to preserve for the coming year the standard of living of 1916; the total is divided by 13 to afford a four-weekly comparison.Thousand Tons.

The deficit in the last twelve weeks is 547,000 tons in cereals and 67,000 tons in meat and bacon ; in other commodities the difference is small. On the other hand some improvement in cereals is noticeable in the most recent period.Consumption.Meat. The supply of home-fed meat at four principal markets in the week ending November 24th (Table B) was 1 per cent, less than last week, but 12^- per cent, above the corresponding week last year. There is a considerable fall in the Central Market, London, in the week November 26th-December 1st, which will appear in next week&apos;s table.The supply of fat cattle and of fat sheep at 59 markets (Table C) were in the week ending November 28th about 1^ per cent, below the previous week ; there was a great falling-off in the supply of pigs.a   4531-1 h
The relations between October and November 1916 and 1917 may be shown as follows, by taking the supply in October 1916 as 100.Supply of Fat Stock at 59 markets in Great Britain.4	Cattle.	Sheep.
