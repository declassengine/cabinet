1.     In-order to meet the enormous demands for accommodation in the Whitehall neighbourhood which have been received during . the War, practically all vacant accommodation in Westminster has been acquired by the Government, and, in addition, a large number of Hotels and office buildings in the occupation of private Firms, who have had to be removed elsewhere. All available space In the Government Buildings has also been fully utilised,   and in Public Buildings, such as the National Gallery,   the National Portrait Gallery, the National Gallery of British Art, Millbank, etc.2,     The point has now been reached when no further large demands for accommodation in the Westminster area can be met without the requisitioning of further Hotels or cf Offices in the occupation of important Firms engaged on urgent War work, or of Clubs in the Pall Mall area, which would further restrict the accommodation-, already very limited, available to members of the Army and Navy and men engaged on important War work temporarily resident in London.3.     Further accommodation could be acquired by the requisitioning of large blocks of Flats, e.g. Queen Anne&apos;s Mansions, St.. James!s Court, etc.-,. but so much Flat accommodation has already been requisitioned that it would now be practically impossible to secure suitable accommodation for the occupants of further blocks of Flats, if they should be requisitioned and in any case the process of rehousing, involving sy many interests, is very lengthy, and   precludes the consideration of the buildings for urgent demands.
4.     It therefore becomes once again imperative to consider the question of removing from Whitehall such of the Government Departments as are not directly engaged in the prosecution of the War, to provide space to meet urgent demands from the War Departments for further accommodation as and when received.5.     One urgent demand at present before the Cabinet Committee on Accommodation, which cannot be met unless a large club or other premises, as mentioned,above, be acquired, is for additional accommodation required by the Military Intelligence Directorate of the War Office at 69/71, Haymarket.   This demand-can only be met by the removal of an Admiralty staff from adjoining premises, Greener House.   The staff in question cannot be rehoused at a greater distance from the admiralty, and it is submitted that the Office of Woods should be removed from their present quarters, which, being opposite the Admiralty, would provide excellent accommodation for the staff in question.6.     The Office of Woods Building comprises approximately 20,000 square feet, and the Admiralty staff require 12,000; the balance of space, if not required by the Admiralty, could be immediately utilised for other War purposes.7.     There is no doubt whatever that further demands will be received in the immediate future which will equally necessitate a similar course of action being taken.8,     It is therefore recommended that authority be given for -to :the immediate removal of the Office of Woods/a portion of the building of the Natural History Museum, South Kensington, whore it is also proposed to rehouse.the Registry of Friendly Societies (who have to be removed from Millbank to provide additional accommodation for the Ministry of Pensions).    The necessary space could be obtained for both Departments without closing the whole of the Museum to the public,-
