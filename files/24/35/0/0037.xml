THIS DOCUMENT IS THE, PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY15 GOVERNMENT,.^20CONFIDENTIAL. G.T. 2937.WAR CABINET.EFFECT ON NORTHERN RUSSIA OF STOPPAGE OF&apos; SUPPLIES EROJfSGUIHEBN RUSSIA.The following Report by Mr. w. Peters who is in England with the Russian Blockade Delegation has been received from. Mr. G.M. Young and is circulatod for Information.(Initialled)   M.P.A.H.2, Whitehall Gardans, S.W. 11th December, 1917.Northern Russia is more or less completely in the hands of the. Bolsheviks.   Southern Russia is more or less controlled by opponents of the Bolsheviks.     In case of necessity Northern Russia can be starved out by Southern Russia:    Southern Russia on the other hand receives practically nothing from Northern Russia which it could not do without.   This state-ment: requires proof.   The proof is given below.A) .FOOD. Northern Russia never was in a position to feed its ownpopulation without drawing on supplies from outside..     In the accompanying diagrammatic representation 0 of the Russian Empire a thick line is drawn across European Russia, dividing ^ very roughly, into a Northern food-importing and a Southern food-exporting half.     During the war the Government has taken upon itself the task of supplying.the chief consuming centres with grain.     This grain has been drawn from the Southern Provinces of Russia.     This year the harvest was nowhere particularly good in Northern Russia.     If Northern Russia receives no supplies from the South stocks of cereals will be exhausted in Spring, probably about March.     Northern Russia also receives her Bupply of meat from Southern Russia. Stoppage of food supplies from the South and from Siberia means starvation in Northern Russia.&apos;B) .CQAI. Before the war the industries of North-Western Russia usedBritish Coal, of which some 6 million tons was imported by the Baltic sea route annually.     Since the outbreak of war this supply ha3 been cut off, and Coal has had to be brought by rail from the Donets Basin in Southern Russia (see diagram), a distance of about 1,000 miles.     There arc no accumulated! Stocks In Petrograd.     Stoppage of Coal supplies from Southern Russia means &apos;unemployment in Petrograd, moan3 too that the  : &apos;&apos; Railways of Northern Russia will be brought practically to a1 -standstill.
- Z -Oil fuel is also used in Russia, particularly in the Moscow industrial district near the Volga, the Oil being brought in Bpecial   barges up the River from the Caspianj     The Oil is pi-oduced in the Caucasus,   and the supply is.thus entirely in the hands of patriotic elements of the population (see diagiam Stoppage of Oil supplies means that Northern Russia will be without Petroleum, Benzine, lubricating Oil, and Oil fuel.$he shortage of supplies of Coal and Oil could, not be coin-penSated by more extensive use of wood as a fuel.    Even as it is the Towns are experiencing great difficulty in securing supplies of firewood.The Iron for the great metallurgical Works of Petrograd and district is smelted chiefly in Southern Russia.     The Ore is produced chiefly in the Krivol Rog district (see diagram), and is smelted by means of Donots Coal.   A much smaller Quantity of Iron is produced in the Ural Mining district (chiefly by means of Charcoal and Lignite).     Northern Russia is without extensive deposits of Iron Ore.5).COTTON-.      The Cotton industry is the biggest factory industry inRussia, employing 500,000 hands.     Its centres are the Moscow industrial district and Petrograd(see diagram).     Of the Cotton spun more than half is usually obtained from Russian Central Asia (see diagram) and (in much smaller quantities)Transcaucasia.. The remainder is obtained from America and Egypt.      This year the famine in Turkestan caused by the impossibility of obtaining grain supplies from European Russia induced the Cotton planters to put a large proportion of their land under Wheat.     The 1917 crop is thus at least 40 per cent under a normal one.   The Cotton mills are not well supplied with Cotton, and if suppliee from Turkestan are stopped will have to close down.-TO SUM UP.        To sum up, stoppage of supplies from Southern Russia moans hunger and unemployment in the North.     To-dayrs news that 400,000 workers are unemployed in Petrograd and a similar number in Moscow shows merely the first stage of the process.0) .0IL.Note:B).IR0N.8th December, 1917
