Memorandum by Secretary for Scotland,, dated 29th Octoberr 1917States that Scotland is making strenuous efforts to increase the annual acreage up to the amount allotted to Scotland, but mentions that increased cultivation will not produce its full result until 1918, the- chief obstacle being the lack of efficient labour, adding that a better and larger supply of labour is essential;   mentions that lack of super-phosphate is a serious obstacle to increased cultivation it having fallen far short of the amount referred to in G.T. 650.States that the Board of Agriculture is very much under-staffed and requires augmentation, proposals in this respect have been laid before the Treasury.gr.T%  744* Memorandum by Food Controller forwarding statement bv^thgWheat Executive.LORD RBOBDDA draws attention to the extremely grave situation in the  heat Executive Memorandum on the bread-stuff needs of the Allies, which-shows that the wheat supply of the world will fall short of the total require-ments of the Allies by about three million tons and that when all cereals available for bread are included there will be still a shortage of two million tons (approximately 10?*) to be made good by special measures.   Lord Rhondda urges immediate steps to ensure tnat American Food Administration shall arrange for export of no less than 1,100,OOU tons of breadstuff grain from Borth America in each of the three months of December to February.
Exportable surplus of the Argentine Wheat crop plus 1-1 million tons of maize should be secured for the European Allies and National Financial arrangements made.     The American Government should be pressed, as a matter of urgency, to arrange to dry enough maize to make good the shortage in wheat shipments.Above all we should make every effort to increase the production of food and to make this increase the first charge on the Hat ion&apos;s resources of men, money, material and machinery. 767t Memorandum by the Board Of Agriculturet dated 24th HoVembcr,1917.States the original programme of three million tons was revised, as the requirements necessary to carry it out will not be forthcoming in time,   Scotland and Ireland, however, will make up some of the reduction. Now aiming at increasing the 1916 total by 2,695,000 acres.    Success can only be achieved with adequate supplies of men, horses, tractors and fuel promptly provided.     It is hoped that one million acres will be done by Government tractors etc., and another one million acres by the farmers with.their own resources supplemented by loaned labour.     Urges that immediate steps be taken by Shipping Controller and Ministry of Munitions to speed up transit from America of   tractors and machinery ordered, as well as adequate supplies of fuel and spare parts; also asks for special railway facilities for prompt distribution of tractors and ploughs; states unless arrangements are made by the Controlling Executive Committee whereby privately owned machinery is provided with oil that it will be impossible for the farmers to accomplish supplying; adds that Mr. Long has informed the ooard of Agriculture that supplies may not be forthcoming.   Mr. Prothero urges that food production should be put upon an equal footing with other War Services, and its requirements all round given priority over other civil and industrial services; asks that Ministry of Munitions may arrange that more ms,terial and labour are supplied to British manufacturers of agricultural machinery; points out that supply of harnesses a limiting factor as regards ploughing and states that a number of skilled ploughmen -&apos; j-s by far the most urgent need of the moment; that&apos; 9,000 additional tractor drivers and ploughmen are required, the bulk of these not before February next. The President of the Board of Agriculture furnishes a statement as to the labour supplied to the Army, (discrepancies are explained in a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War,      (G-.T.2854 of 4.12.17)), and asks that the Army shall provide a small number Of skilled tradesmen; states that it is essential that farmers shall receive at the earliest possible date an assurance from the Food Controller that reason-5 le Prices will be obtained next year.   Comments on the deficiency of sulphate and ammonia, adding that it is for the Cabinet to decide whether in the present situation, requirements of munition manufacturers or of food supplies are to be given preference.
