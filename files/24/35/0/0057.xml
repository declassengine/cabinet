[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]      Jj*0SECRET.s^__fc^HALL SOME NOTES ON PEACE ARRANGEMENTS.**-*ar/i.--v-,:::.JTie Balkans.IT is easy to state the Balkan peace problem, but not very easy to solve it. The facts appear to be as follows : Bulgaria is tired of the war, which she was formally assured by the Germans would be over in four months after she entered it; and doubtless she would be glad to make peace if her war aims were satisfied. What then are her war aims? Roughly speaking, they are the acquisition of those territories which she secured at the end of the first Balkan war, and which were torn from her after the second Balkan war by the Treaty of Bukarest. In these territories must be included not only the Bulgarian portion of the Dobrudja, Kavalla, and the &quot; uncontested zone,&quot; but also the &quot; contested zone,&quot; which Serbia agreed, after the first Balkan war, to submit to the arbitration of the Tsar of Russia.Now, all these territories, and something more are at present in the occupation of Bulgarian troops; and I have personally little doubt that, if they were secured to Bulgaria, she would gladly shake herself, free from her Central European Allies, and settle down to the enjoyment of territories which her whole population is unanimous in believing to be Bulgarian. It is this conviction which inspires her present efforts and also supplies her leaders with the argument that they are really fighting for one of the main causes for which the Entente Powers are struggling the cause of nationalities.On this statement of the case it might seem, at first sight, as if no very skilful diplomatic effort were required to detach Bulgaria from Germany ; especially as there is no love lost between the two nations. Bulgarians care for little but Bulgaria, but if she has a sentimental preference for one group of foreign communities rather than another, the preference is for Russia and England rather than for Austria and Germany.What then are the difficulties that lie in the way? As I understand the matter, there are three :-The first is the entanglement with Germany, the intermixture of armies, and the number of German soldiers and civilians who control Bulgarian administration. This, however, is probably the least serious of all the difficulties. If the Bulgarian Government and people were once resolved to shake off these military and bureaucratic trammels, I think that they could do so without very much trouble.The second difficulty is the personality of the Tsar Ferdinand. He is the ablest man in his dominions; quite unscrupulous ; and very much afraid that, if the Entente Powers achieved a conclusive victory, he personally would receive short shrift from the victors. He has no desire to add one to the number of throneless kings who are now in exile, and he will never willingly consent to a peace by which his own dynasty would, in his judgment, be threatened. This obstacle, again, could, I think, easily be surmounted. After all, it is no part of our business to settle for the Bulgarians who is to reign over them, and, now that the Russian Tsar has been deposed, no nation is likely to spend either blood or treasure in order to be revenged on the Bulgarian Tsar. If assurances on this point are a condition of his neutrality, they ought, in my opinion, to be given.[1130] B
The third difficulty is the really formidable one. It arises directly out &quot;of the history of the Balkans and our relations with the other Balkan States. The extensions of territory which, as I have -already observed, Bulgaria desires, include part, at least, of Dobrudja, which belongs to Roumania ; Kavalla and some adjacent territory, which belongs to Greece; and the &quot;contested&quot; and &quot; uncontested&quot; zones, which belong to Serbia.&apos; All these States are our Allies. All of them are fighting on our side. Nor is there one of them who would not regard the transference of any part of these regions to their hated neighbour as a great betrayal. Even the mere rumour that such questions were uuder discussion would send a tremor of fear and indignation from Jassy to Athens. Roumania, Serbia, and Greece know perfectly well that Bulgarian support can never be&apos; purchased except at their expense.We seem, therefore, to have reached an impasse. The military advantage of detaching Bulgaria from the Central Powers is immense; but it seems impossible even to discuss how this end is to be accomplished without alienating three of our Allies as soon as they hear of the discussion, which, whatever precautions were taken, would be almost at once. Long before Bulgaria was secured we should have lost Greece, Roumania, and Serbia. The only hope that 1 can see of getting round the difficulty is, if and when the fitting moment comes, to use some such language as the following to the friendly Balkan States : We might point out to them that history and common sense alike show that, if the Balkan States will not be content to live side by side in peace, the great&apos; civilising work which, with the aid of Europe, they have accomplished in freeing themselves from Turkish tyranny will bear only half its legitimate fruit. The Balkans, emancipated though they be, will remain the plague-spot of Europe and a perpetual danger to the peace of the world. In the common interest, some arrangement ought to be come to which gives a promise of stability ; and this arrangement, if it is to be satisfactory, ought to ba arrived at by the Balkan States themselves, and not forcibly imposed from without. At the end of the first Balkan war it looked as if some such arrangement had been accom-plished; and, though these hopes were blasted by the second Balkan war, it should not be beyond the power of Balkan statesmen to repair the evil which has been done. So far as we. the great Entente Powers, are concerned, we regard the cause of our Balkan Allies as our own, and we have no more thought of abandoning them than of abandoning each other. Nevertheless, it would in our opinion be well worth their while to consider among themselves whether some arrangement could not be come to which would relieve present distresses and provide security against their repetition.No doubt one of the difficulties (we might go on to say) in the way of devising a &quot;policy satisfactory to all the four Balkan States is that any reversion to the territorial distribution agreed to at the end of the first Balkan war would deprive Greece, Serbia, and Roumania of territories which they obtained by the second Balkan war. Possibly, however, an arrangement might be made in harmony with the principles of nationality which would give our three Allies more than anything they would lose by satisfying what Bulgaria deems to be her just rights. What, in their own interests, they ought to desire is not the retention of territory which is now largely occupied by Bulgarians, but the acquisition of territory which is Roumanian, or Serbian, or Greek, as the case may be. That there are territories inhabited by Roumanians which do not belong to Roumania, by Serbians which do not belong to Serbia, by Greeks which do not belong to Greece, is undoubted ; and the
only question is : Could the present possessors of those territories be induced, or, in the case of enemy countries, compelled, to give them up, if such a surrender -would really secure the immediate neutrality of Bulgaria, and the future peace and unity of the Balkan peoples ? Evidently the Roumanian-speaking part of Bessarabia is much more important to Roumania than the Bulgarian portion of the Dobrudja. In the same way, no one can doubt that if Bosnia and Herzegovina, with an adequate access to the Adriatic, and a right to use the Greek port of Salonica, were secured for Serbia, she would be much better off, and have a much greater future, than if her old frontiers of 1914 were restored unaltered. Similarly, if Greece were given the iEgean islands, which were in Turkish possession when the war broke out, she would make a good exchange for Ivavalla and the adjacent district.Such a rearrangement of territory would obviously be made at the expense, partly of Austria and Turkey, who are our enemies, partly of Russia, and to some slight extent, it may be, of Italy, who are our friends. It would involve no sacrifice on the part of France or Britain; but if the cession of Cyprus to Greece would secure a stable Balkan arrangement (though not otherwise) I personally should be prepared to advise the surrender.The essence of the above policy is that it should be carried out, not merely with the acquiescence, but with the goodwill of our Balkan Allies. We must not make an arrangement (or attempt to make an arrangement), with Bulgaria, and then go to Roumania, Serbia, and Greece, and press for their consent. We must first obtain their consent (if possible, their hearty consent), and then go to Bulgaria.This policy, however difficult to carry through, seems the only one which promises any success, and which can be effected without some kind of negotiation behind the backs of our Balkan friends. That it is conceived entirely in their interest seems to me quite plain. Whether we shall be able to persuade them that it is so remains to be seen. Personally, I incline to doubt whether the present moment is favourable for the attempt. Events must probably still further develop before the path of true wisdom becomes clear, either to friends or enemies. The Balkan peoples, with all their admirable qualities, are much more faithful to their hates than to their loves, and would much rather injure a rival than benefit themselves.A. J. B.

Conclusion.Serbia would give up an area of about 9,500 square miles with a population of about 635,000, and would receive an area of about 25,371 square miles with a population of about 2,478,411, gaining on the balance an area of about 15,871 square miles and a population of about 1,843,411.Bulgaria would gain an area of about 12,500 square miles, apart from the Serres, Drama, and Kavalla districts, the exact area of which is not presently known, with a population of about 1,241,932 (including the population of the Serres, Drama, and the Kavalla districts).Roumania would give up an area of about 3,000 square miles- with a population of about 300,000, mostly Turks, and should receive in return the Kishineff district of Bessarabia and   nthern Bukovina, which can be claimed as Roumanian, ethnographically speaking, v, e do not possess sufficient data to fix the proportion of the population.Greece would give up the Jerres, Drama, and Kavalla districts with a population of about 306,932, and would be confirmed in her acquisition of the.islands specified, which are together of an area of about 2,100 square miles with a population of about 320,000. ^ -
