[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestyfs Government.] Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1917.CONFIDENTIAL.Sir G. Buchanan to Lord Eardinge.My-dear Charlie, Petrograd, November 20, 1917.SINCE I wrote to you a week ago no progress has been made as regards the formation of a Socialist Government. On the contrary ; there has been a serious split in the ranks of the Bolshevik party, and out of the fourteen commissaries eight have tendered their resignations as a protest against the suppression of liberty of the press and other arbitrary measures. The Government is thus in the hands of a small clique of Extremists, who are attempting to impose their will on the country by terroristic methods. There are signs of growing dissatisfaction with the prolongation of the crisis both among the troops and amon? the workmen, and several factories have recently sent delegates who in very outspoken language told the Bolsheviks to stop talking and to come to an agreement with the other Socialist organisations. One of them even went so far as to say that the only idea of Lenin and Trotzky was to sleep, like Kerensky, in- Nicolas II&apos;s bed. It was hoped at first that the secession of so many prominent Bolshevik leaders would bring the more moderate members of the party into line with the representatives of the other Socialist organisations, and that a Government would be formed from which Lenin and Trotzky would be excluded. This hope has not been realised, and the Extremists are now making great efforts to win over to their side the left wing of the Social Revolutionary party, anxl to induce the seceding members of their own party to return. If they succeed in this they will consolidate their position for the time, but if the peace which they have promised is long delayed, and if bread, which every day is getting scarcer, fails, the masses may rise and overthrow them. For some reasons it is better that, they should be given a fair trial, as the longer they remain in office the greater will be their final fall. Except in the Ministry of War, the majority of the staffs are still on strike, the supply of .coal for the railways is getting dangerously short, the army and the larger towns are threatened with famine, and sooner or later the whole machinery of Government must break down altogether. What will happen then it is impossible to say. Some people declare that we shall have a Monarchy in a couple of months, but, though the great majority of the population are disenchanted of their revolution, I do not see how this change is to be effected unless Kaledin can get the army to rally round him, and there is but little likelihood of this. At the present moment force alone counts, and as the bourgeois par ties have failed to organise any armed force in their support, the Bolsheviks have it all their own way. During the recent fighting in Petrograd and Moscow the cadets of the military schools alone sided with the Government, and, being without officers and hopelessly out-numbered, they sacrificed their lives in vain. At Moscow there are said to have been as many as 5,000 casualties, as owing to the casual way in which, the Red Guard fired in the streets there were heavy losses among the civil population. The reports which reached us of the destruction of some of the old churches were, I am glad to say, exaggerated, and they only appear to have been slightly damaged, while the stories about pogroms were quite unfounded.Here everything is quiet in the town, but it may be only the calm that precedes a storm. If food supplies fail the situation will again become very serious, and as a precautionary measure we,are having stores brought into the Embassy, and arranging to house all the stall&apos; and the officers belonging to the various military missions so as to form a strong garrison for its defence.I was interrupted here by an unexpected visit from Skobeleff and Tchaykoffsky, the object of which I am reporting by telegraph.   I have no time to write more beforethe bag closed.&apos;Ever yours,GEORGE W. BUCHANAN.
