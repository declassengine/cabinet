(i) LACK OF CO-ORDINATION IN PURCHASES OF MEAT &amp; CHEESE.

(ii) ORDER OF PRIORITY IN SUPPLIES OF FOOD AND MUNITIONS RESPECTIVELY.

Copies of Memoranda submitted to the War Cabinet at the request of Mr. Austen Chemberlain for consideration in conjunction with the Memorandum by the Food Controller on Food Supplies (G.180).

(i).

Lack of co-ordination in purchases of meat and cheese.

That it would appear that purchases of meat and cheese are made both by the Board of Trade for the War Office, by the Army Council on its own account and by the Food Controller.

That it does not appear that there is any co-ordination between these Departments as to these purchases.

That the questions raised by this division of authority though largely affecting the work of the American Board are outside the scope of its reference and are submitted for Cabinet decision.

AUSTEN CHAMBERDAIN,

Chairman, American Board.

(ii).

Order of priority in supplies of food and munitions respectively.

That for the purpose of presenting any trustworthy estimate of British requirements to the Inter-Ally Council it is urgently necessary that the American Board should have a clear indication from the War Cabinet as to the relative urgency of supplies of food and munitions respectively; as far as can be seen it would appear that if the programme of the Ministry of Munitions is carried out there will be neither sufficient credits nor tonnage to meet the requirements of the Food Controller and vice versa that if the requirements of the Food Controller are sanctioned those of the Ministry of Munitions cannot be met.

Even if additional credits are provided by the United States of America the tonnage difficulty would still remain, and the British delegates would have to admit to the Inter-Ally Council that the supplies for which they are asking are greater than they can transport.

It is not within the province of the Board to decide those questions of priority, but the Board cannot present the British case in a watertight form until they have been decided by the War Cabinet.

AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN,

Chairman, American Board.

12th December 1917.
