Intelligence Bureau, Department of Information. PSW/015.WEEKLY   REPORT   OB   SPAIN.   TT. (Dec 13th, 1917)The last report of a fortnight ago spoke of the increased activity and openness of German intrigue in Spain.     This continues and grows worse:   pro-Ally newspapers state that more than half the Press is bought by Germany and the cause of the Allies is chiefly defended by some of the smaller papers, while some of the more important papers which used to denounoe German outrages and espionage now avoid these subjects.    Our friends in the Press further declare without any mincing of w^rds that Aloald Zamora, the Minister of Public Works, is a hired agent of the German Embassy.   And indeed there is very little secret about the faot that the paper which he edits is German property.     It is even more ominous, perhaps, that the organ of the all powerful offioer&apos;s Juntas has lately printed an absurd slander, obviously of German invention, that the British were contemplating the occupation of some land on the Spanish mainland near Gibraltar.    Anyhow pro-Ally feeling in Spain is sufficiently alarmed and talks ot the danger of German money producing a pro-German Cortes after the dissolution, to be followed by a Zamora Cabinet, to be followed by an entry into the war on the aide of Germany.But while German activity-in Spain isJuAdoubtedly a reality which has lately given proofs only too unpleasant of its power, there are after all limits which there is little danger of its being able to overstep.     Spain will not fight for Germany, first because her army does not wish to fight for anybody, and secondly because Germany cannot help or greatly hurt her and the Allies canSECRET.
do both to any extent they choose.     Moreover the whole Radical and Republican world, which has whown itself to be a growing force in Spain is, broadly speaking, pro-Ally, as also are many of the Official Loberals and Conservatives such as Dato, Lema and Romanones:   and war for Germany would alaotet certainly cause a Revolution.These extreme dangers, then, may be dismissed and journalisticalarums.   The talk about them may be sincere, or it may be meresensationalism, or perhaps it may be aimed at frightening theBritish and French Governments into spending as much money insupport of their friends in the Press as their enemies receive fromthe Germans.     Both Spaniards and English travellers in Spainfrequently point out the comparative inactivity of the Allies incounteracting the increasing efforts of the German Jmbassy tocontrol not only the Press but the official and political worldin Spain.    But other observers reply that not all the Germanmethods are methods we should care to imitate:   and that some ofthese methods may tend in Spain as in America to do their own de-earfswiiag better than it ceuld have been done   by others.Meanwhile the most important event of the fortnight shows clearly that the Germans are far from being all powerful.     They had managed to get rid of Senor Dato, like Count Romanones before him, just when he was *n the point of signing a com-ercial agreement with Great Britain:   and they confidently counted, and expressed their confidence in the Press, that &quot;the corpse of the agreement would not be exhumed&quot;.   But after a brief delay and a visit of the Spanish Ambassador to Madrid to explain the negotiations he had so nearly concluded in London, the agreement has actually been signed, with a few slight modifications of little importance.     The question of the Spanish exchange, now so unfavourable to commercial inter-
course between the two countries, has been left over for a subse-quent arrangement which is not believed to be likely to present very great difficulties, though this also has been denounced in advance by the pro-German Press.     The conclusion of the Agreement is a conspicuous victory for Biitish diplomacy and an equally conspicuous defeat for the Germans who, very naturally, worked their hardest to prevent our getting the Spanish ore which is almost indispensable for the manufacture of our munitions of war.    -Ho doubt our diplomatists were powerfully assisted by the fact that Spain urgently needs coal, cotton and other things which she can only get from the Allies.     England was in a fssition to refuse coal if she did not get the ore she required, and Barcelona has been much alarmed by reports that America will refuse cotton unless Spain grants the demands of the^llies.     Moreover, jssny thousands of Spaniards depend for their livelihood on the export of fruit, especially orgnges;   and the fact that much of this fruit has this year been rotting unsold, is, as some of the Spanish papers have been pointing out, solely due to pro-German influences which pre-vented the Cortina Convention being ratified in the summer.     These arguments no doubt proved too powerful, especially as they admitted of no reply from Germany, who can neither buy from Spain nor sell to her.     The satisfactory result is that we have got our ore on conditionrof taking some rjranges with it and sending some coal in exchange for it.German recovery from this rebuff will not be made easier by the torpedoing of another Spanish ship causing further loss of life. Details have not yet arrived, but it appears that even papers which are not great friends of the Allies threaten retaliation on the part of Spain if the Germans continue these outrages.
v298Meanwhile the political situation remains difficult and unsettled. A very large and orderly demonstration in Madrid, and otherselse-where, have demanded an amnesty for the imprisoned strike-leaders. This course, which is understood to be favoured by the King, would probably be followed at once but for two reasons.    One is a legal difficulty.    The King can grant a pardon, but it is doubted whether his pardon will do more than release the men from prison. Many jurists think that only an Act ef Parliament can give them a&amp;ok their &quot;Civil Rights&quot;, i.e. the right of voting and holding public offices, such as the Professorship formerly held by one of them and the seats in the Madrid Municipality to which several of them have been lately elected.    The other difficulty ia the opposition of the army &quot;Juntas&quot;, whose newspapers appear hostile and whose leaders are believed to oppose any amnesty going beyond a mere release from prison.    The political friends of the prisoners, on the other hand, regard anything less than full rehabilitation as an insult.The amnesty problem leads on to the other unsolved problem, that of diosolving or meeting the old Cortes.    Most of the older states-men, especially Lato and Romanones, are in favour of the latter course, which would seem the more natural if the state of affairs were normal;   for the present Parliament has only been in existence a year and three-quarters   and it seems fairly certain that, with the promised support of Count R*manones and the probable support of the Conservatives, the Cabinet could pass its Budget and a bill of amnesty and postpone the danger of the &quot;free&quot; eleo ien to which it is committed.   But the objection to this course is the opposition of the Catalans, whose leader, Senor Cambo, is bent on an immediate and free General Election from which he calculates to return at the head of a much larger party.     The latest reports
299uindicate that for these reasons and in fear of the hostility of a section of the soldiers to the present Cortes, the plan of disso-lution will he adopted.     No one can prophesy what will come of it. Romanones has just made a speech in which he has publicly declared that the Rotativist system is dead and cannot be revived, and he approves of the policy of a &quot;free&quot; election if there is to be one at all   now.     It seems cettain that the Government will keep to their promise in this respect.     Such an election is sure to give increased strength to the Catalan^ ^n&amp; Republicans, and, if things in the new Parliament proceed-constitutionally, almost sure to reduce the power of the Srown, a policy which even the Maurists now advocate.     But no one car. guarantee that things will go constitu-ttenftily, in view of the uncertainty of the results of a &quot;free&quot; election and Of the violent language used by Cambo, who threatens the King with a revolution if he does not get his own way, in view of the condition of the army which, though said to be pertly divided against itself, is certainly restless, excited and dangerous, end perhaps, above all, in view of the scarcity of food in the country r.nd the superabundance of Germans.     In any case it seems certain that all the statesmanship of Spain will be pUt to a severe test in 1918.
