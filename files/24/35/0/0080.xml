Ootoael fcwr311(This Document Is the Property ofHis Britannic Majecty?s Government.)PACIFISMI circulate a report by Mr. Basil Thomson cf the result of the examination of the books and papers ^fv-s-vme of the principal paoifist ^societies.oember, 1917.Go CAVE.[SHIP OF RECONCILIATION.The examination of the minutes and account books of this Society which followed upcn the raid by the police has provided seme rather interesting infor-mation.The Fellowship was formed in consequence of a Quakers&apos; conference held at Cambridge in the last weeks of 1914 and its founder and first chairman was Doctor Henry T. Hcdgkin who was quoted by Mr. Rowntree in the debate of December 5th on the Redistribution Bill as an instance of one rf the persons who would suffer disfranohisement as a conscientious objector.     It was to be a religious movement to &quot;establish a world order based on love&quot; which consequently &quot;forbids the waging of war and calls for a life service&quot; to be given in the following methods:- Meetings, both public and private, literature and the education of the young, the enrolment and training of workers.     For six months the Society was conducted by a General Committee, but afterwards, when funds began to come in more freely, the work was divided among several subsidiary committees.     Much of the money was subscribed towards a &quot;colony of Juvenile Delinquents, an industrial school for children that started badly&quot;, at Sysonby.The membership rose from 3,700 in January, 1916 to its present membership of 6,321.A number of rather wild schemes were proposed in the early days of the Society.     It was suggested, for example, that the Fellowship might help to pay the indemnity due to Belgium, supposing Germany refused, but on the whole, the idea of engaging in political propaganda was disconntenanoed, though with such a varied number of interests on the committee, it was impossible that this resolution could be maintained.Among the principal subscribers are the family of Ellis, in which five ladies between them subscribed  2,000:   Mr. Barrow Cadbury,  250:   Mr. Joseph Rowntree,  100:   Mr. C. M.. Doncaster,  400:   Mr. J. Braithwaite,  50:   Mr. and Mrs. Bocke,  200:.     Cornelius Bocke is a Dutch Quaker who married Beatrice, the daughtor of Mr. Richard Cadbury.     The finances of the Fellowship were hampered by the expenses of the Delinquents Colony, by a salary list from which two clergymen, the Rev. Riohard Roberts and the Rev, Leighton Richards, drew between them  900 a year, and 1 by the printing of their Qrgan &quot;The Venturer&quot;, on whioh the loss was continuous
There is, however, no traoe of any money being received from abroad.The Fellowship took an interest in the Conscientious Objectors almost from the start, and founded an emergency fund and an employment bureau to help them. Ou the representation of ene of their members, Captain J. R. White, a son of Sir GBOBge White, who has been identified with the extremists in Ireland, and of a Mr. Bray, a Catholic-undergraduate at Oxford, they decided to start a branch in Ireland, but in April. 1916 their missioner reported that he had found auong the Irish an atmosphere of good-naturod obstruction and that the attitude was not very hopeful.The next venture was to effect the circulation of their literature in India and in October 1915 we find an artless minute recorded that, &quot;as it would be difficult to get literature through to India owing to the censorship, Miss Ellis should concert with the Rev. Richard Roberts a means of getting the literature through by means of missionaries or in any other way that seemed available&quot;.It is to be gathered from the minutes that a manifesto addressed to German socialists was drawn up by Dr. Orchard and taken over to Germany by Mr. Bocke in July or August, 1915 where it was handed to Bernstein cf the German Socialist Party and read to several other German socialists.     In September 1915 It was decided that Mr. Bocke should not give an account of his journey to Germany in public, but that its results should be used as far as possible privately. Throughout the minutes there are entries showing that, while the Fellowship modestly kept in the background when political action was to be taken, it authorised its members to take the action &quot;as individuals&quot;.     This ingenious way of carrying on the propaganda is evident whenever opposition to military service acts or pacifist propaganda are in question.Among the activities of the Sooiety may be mentioned the sending of Miss Henriette Thomas to Germany in January, 1915, an intention which does not seem to have been carried out:   the intention to get in touch with the &quot;Anti-War Council of Holland&quot;:   canvassing at theosophical colleges:   proselytizing in Ireland: &apos; the insertion of letters in the press tempered to suit the taste of each particular paper:   proselytizing among sympathetic foreigners with a view to spreading propaganda in their committee:   sending Miss Wilson to The Hague to confer with four German women:- (This conference decided that the War Aims as they were in February, 1915 should be announced and criticised England for seizing German trade, eto.) - a suggestion that Miss Emily Hobhouse should carry literatur into Italy:   the sending of Miss Gardner and Miss Royden to The Hague Conference: proselytizing among Boy Scouts as media for peace work and among the older boys at schools:   addresses to be given to Sunday Schools about the virtues of German children:   pacifist correspondence with Russia through the Headley Press:   the circulation of Pacifist books in schools and free libraries and the ciroulation of &quot;history leaflets&quot;, that is, historical tales tending to foster paoifist ideas.It has been ascertained that a deposit of over  2,000 in the National Pro-vincial Bank of England in the names of Miss Ellis and Mr. Edward Backhouse (who is a banker at Leeds) was money set apart for the purchase of the premises of
Q-1 ? u 1 /C*thf Delinquent Colony at Sysonby. NATIONAL^OQuTTCnL FOR CIVIL LIBERTIES.This Society appears to have been founded in January, 1916, and through-out that year it was known as the National Council against Conscription.   Its Offices were then at 22, Bride Lane, E.C., but in September, 1917, thoy were removed to 33, Henrietta Street, W.C.The income of the Society is not largo.     The average of 1916 and 1917 is under  4,000 a year, and the money is expended, for the most part, in the payment of salaries,- expenses of public meetings, advertising, and printing. Jts propaganda is oarried on by the distribution of leaflets and pamphlets, written by such authors as John Dillon, Bortrand Russell. J. A. Hobson, M. Farbman, (the Russian Press Correspondent), Norman Angell, Philip Snowden, Ramsay Macdonald, Lord Shaw, Mrs. Hobheuse, and Lord Parmoor.All the Offieials are /if British ^esoent, and the lecturers are well known Labour speakers, such as George Lansbury, Tom Richardson, M.P., and Tern Mann.The Society makes occasional contributions towards the legal expenses of appeals by consoientiqus objectors.     The o&amp;oques are signed by Mrs. Snowden, and Mrs. Marjorie Manus.     The aaoounts are well kept, and are audited by a firm of Chartered AcQ&amp;untants.     There is, however, an absence of vouchers in support of expenditure.The Council has a current aooount at Barclay&apos;s, Ltd., and on the 17th of November, the balance was  194   6s, Id.The income of the Society is made up of subscriptions and donations for general and special purposes, the latter being the defence of particular individuals.     An income of  438   3s,    0d, is derived from &quot;Affiliation Fees&quot;, from suoh Societies as the Independent Labour Party, the National Union of Railwaymen, and Trades and Labour Councils in various town?].     Affiliation Fees have also been paid by the No-Conscription Fellowship and the Fellowship of Reconciliation.     There has been a very marked decline in public sub-scriptions since the early days of 1916, but there has been an increase in Affiliation Fees, thusj-The subscriptions and donations for 1916 amounted to  4,236   10s. 7dwhile for the ten and a half months of 1917, they amounted to only 2,229   12s. Od.     The Affiliation Fees in the same periods rose from 167   10s,   lOd. to  432   12s.   2d.Money was expended for Organisers&apos; salaries, and expenses of lecturers. ,    -Among the larger subscribers are the following:-Clifford Allen   ...      ...      ...      50   -     -dMr. and Mrs. Charles Rod Barrow Cadbury Marian Ellis R.

and there are three anonymous subscriptions of from  50   0s.   Od. to  130   0s.   Od. Among the smaller subscribers are:-It will be notioed that several of theso are subscribers to other Pacifist Societies.The Council has purchased in the past thirteen months 81,513 pamphlets, leaflets, etc., the greater part of which have been distributed.The books disolosed no evidence of any funds having come from Enemy sources.     The energies of the Society have been devoted to opposing Conscrip-tion, and encouraging the Conscientious Objector.     Pacifism appears only to be a secondary question, though most of the prominent members and workers are .well known supporters of Pacifist organisations.v?HE PEAOE NEGOTIATIONS COMMITTEE.This Committee appears to be run by the Keverend ii. Dunnico, and to receive its financial and moral support from Mr. Charles iloden uuxton, who seems to have been paying the salary of Miss Chambers, the Organiser, out of his own pocket.     The Chairivoman was Mrs. Swanwick, who received payment for her speeches.     She seems to have given cause for complaint, owing to her rare attendance at the Office.Among the subscribers, occur the names of subscribers to other Peace Societies, but the amounts are all small, and many working class people sent 2s. 6d. to 5s. 0d., especially from the North of England.The Committee engineered a Peaoe Memorial to the Prime Minister, and used the opportunity afforded by canvassing, to push their Pacifist propaganda.The Committee appears to have been in continual straits for money.   Their campaign in llJ16 was estimated at a cost of from  1,000 to  1,400, towards which they had only received  500,The Memorial to the Prime Minister was kept in reserve until the psychol-ogical moment arrived for presenting it.     On August 7th, lyi7, Mr. Buxton thought that the moment should be after the Offensive had had a week or two more to run, but before the Meeting of Parliament.     On August 14th we find him writing to Mr. Dunnico, directing him to send oopies of the Memorial to each of the Russian Delegates, Rousannoff, Ehrlich, Smirnoff, and Gcldenburg.The quality and importance of the work of the Committee may bo judged from the fa*t that they thought it worth while to employ ex-Inspector Syme to speal for them on eight occasions.THE NO-CONSCRIPTION FELLOYJSHIP.Mr. Bocke     ...     .....       ...  15Lord and Lady Courtney of Penwith  202. Backhouse............  25Sir Georgw Fordhan......  10J. A. Hofason-,       ...     ...     ...  12Theodore Rowntree......      ...  10Mrs. Bernard Shaw.........  10Sir D. M. Stevenson        ......  205-d -d0This Swoiety appears to have - been formed shortly before the passing of
tthe Military Service Act.     Having failed to avert Conscription, it devoted itself to the protection of the Conscientious Objector.The accounts show that the income from subscriptions, donations, and levies, from October, 1916, to July, 1917, amounted to  4,400, and for the sale of literature,&apos;to  997.     The Salary List and Rent amounted to  845   8s.   3d.There were internal quarrels about finance, and in September last, the Financial Secretary remarked, &quot;Financial control is impossible whilst the meetings &quot;of the Finance Committoe are ignored, and irregular and unauthorised expenditure is incurred.  .............. Discipline is entirely lacking,indifference is in ovidence, and enthusiasm is wanting&quot;.Among the papers was a proposal that the future work of the Society should bo for disarmament in this country, as the surest guarantee of International Friendship, and to unite with Disarmament Groups in other countries.     There was also a letter from Albert INKFIH to C. G. AMMOM, dated the 8th November, 1917, saying that he had consulted the Committee of the British Socialist Party as to his undertaking the issue of a manifesto of the Workers&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Council, He says that the work given by him to this Council since the Leeds Convention has interfered with his duties as Secretary of the British Socialist Party, and that the continued absence from Committee Meetings of the Soldiers&apos; and Workers&apos; Council, of Messrs. Jowett, Snowden, Anderson, and Lansbury, shows a lack of interest which cannot conduce to its success.     Under these circumstances, the British Socialist Party will not permit him (Mr. Inkpin) to proceed with the work.The documents disclose no evidence of Enemy influence or financial support. The Fellowship is conducted in an unbusinesslike way by cranks, and its influence outside the circle of Conscientious Objectors, seems to be small.
