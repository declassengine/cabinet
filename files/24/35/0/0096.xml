December 1917&apos;.SECRET.&apos; ;\ y   (	3^		/ \V /	NAVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION-No: 29. Tf ee&amp; ewfec? 8^ December.NAVAL OPEEATIONS.Mines have been laid in the Heligoland Bight, and the laying of a deep minefield off North Sea. the East Coast has been commenced.Mines have been laid off the Belgian coast. FlandersR.N.A.S. machines from Dunkirk have- bombed enemy aerodromes at St. Denis area-Westrem, Sparappelhoek, Uitkerke, Engel and Aertrycke, and also Bruges Docks and railway traffic at various places.   The total weight of bombs dropped was about 15^ tons. In aerial fighting 7 enemy machines have been destroyed and 11 driven down out of control,. 3 of which were probably also destroyed.On the night of December lsfr-2nd enemy aeroplanes dropped bombs on, and fired Mediter-machines guns at Sukerair camp (about 20 miles N.N.E. of-Gaza), but they were driven off ranean. by anti-aircraft guns ashore and no damage was done.On December 2nd 7 enemy aeroplanes attempted to bomb Gliki aerodrome (Mitylene), but they were driven off by our machines, several indecisive engagements taking place.A disastrous explosion of a French munition vessel has occurred in the Narrows at Casualties. Halifax as the result of a collision with a Belgian Relief steamer. A large portion of the town has been destroyed and great destruction caused in the dockyard where the dry dock buildings have been burnt, but the dock itself is believed to be intact. H.M.S. &apos;* Highflyer &quot; sustained slight injuries, 9 of her crew being killed or missing and 13 wounded. A tug has been wrecked; 6 steamers badly damaged and several others more or less injured.The United States Destroyer &quot; Jacob Jones &quot; has been torpedoed and sunk about 30 miles S.S.W. of the Scilly Islands, 42 of the crew being saved.The Aimed Boarding Steamer &quot; Grive &quot; has been torpedoed East of the Shetlands, but has been brought into port and grounded.The Armed Trawler &quot; Lord Grey &quot; has been wrecked on La Barriere Shoal, East of Cape Grisnez.The Armed Trawler &quot; Apley &quot; has been blown up by mine off Selsea Bill.ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.During the week 15 to 19 large enemy submarines have been located, of which 3 were of Submarines the &quot; cruiser &quot;type, one being homeward and two outward bound. The enemy&apos;s operations operating, have been exclusively; confined to close waters, no reports having been received of sub-marines operating more than 70 miles from land, the principal areas of activity having been off the Yorkshire coast and at the western entrance to the English Channel.(c 813) 55  12/17 h&amp;s

Submarines possibly sunk are not included.Jn addition to the losses of enemy submarines which have previously been notified in this Appreciation, the loss of 7 small and 1 large enemy submarines may now be con-sidered as established. All of these, except one, occurred in the period July to October, 1917, and have been verified by information derived from Prisoners of War, casualty lists and other sources.MEKCANTILE LOSSES BY ENEMY ACTION.The following is a Comparative Statement of the Number and Tonnage of all Merchant &amp;*T6nnage Vessels sunk in recent weeks by enemy action : Vessels lost.Number	British Vessels.

From these tables it will be seen that the percentage of. losses to sailings, as regards overseas trades, is only .64 as against 2.26 last week. This large reduction is accounted for not only by the fact that the tonnage lost is less than one-third of that sunk in the previous week but also owing to an appreciable increase in the total British tonnage afloat engaged in these trades. On the.other hand, the percentage of losses in the Coasting Trade is nearly double that of the previous week.The table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all British Merchant Vessels Areas in sunk, damaged or. molested, and of: all Allied and Neutral Merchant Vessels sunk in the wnicn last two weeks by enemy craft and by mine classified according to areas. vessels lost.It will be noticed that the losses are again almost entirely confined to the waters -surrounding Great Britain and to the Mediterranean.The following statement shows the number- and gross tonnage of all Merchant Vessels Compara-lostby enemy action in each month since the commencement of unrestricted SubmarineWarfare	British Merchant		British Fishing		Merchant Vessels		Merchant Vessels		Total	1917.

The November figures are better than those for any month since September, 1916; when the number of vessels lost was greater, namely 165, but their aggregate tonnage only 230,651 tons.The following table shows the British, Allied and Neutral losses in the Mediterranean Monthly for the last four months and the percentage of losses in the Mediterranean to losses in all losses in the areas:- !

Of these, 2,412, with an aggregate since out-tonnage of 5,842,305, were British vessels.                                                       &apos; ^(c 813) a 2break of war.
The following Table shows the average daily tonnage of British Merchant Vessels which was sunk or damaged by Enemy Action or which escaped from attack for each month since the unrestricted Submarine Warfare commenced, standardized by taking 100 as the daily average for February in each case : Month.

There seems to be a tendency, however, for the successful attacks to result in relatively fewer ships being sunk and more being damaged.. ENEMY MINES.Minelaying. Enemy minelaying activity during the week has been somewhat more marked and has been experienced in the Lerwick and Firth of Forth areas, off the south-east coast of England, in the Portsmouth area and in the Firth of Clyde, where a submarine mine-layer was reported inside Cumbrae Channel, necessitating the temporary closing of the Clyde and the opening of temporary channels. The bottom sweeps and other steps which were taken, successfully dealt with the situation in this area without loss of tonnage.Casualties.

During the week 703 ships have been convoyed as compared with 705 last week.Of these 703 ships, 377 were engaged in the French Coal Trade, 146 on the Scandinavia-Lerwick-Humber Route, and. the remaining 180 in overseas trade (128 inward and 52 outward). There have been 4 losses in convoy during the week, 3 in the homeward convoy from Port Said having been sunk in the Mediterranean, and 1 engaged in the French Coal Trade.During the week 39 Merchant Vessels have been fitted to take primary armament, and 52 to take supplementary armament such as Howitzers and Bomb-throwers. The number of Merchant Vessels at present fitted for defensive armament is 3,694, and of these, 271 have also been fitted for supplementary armament.The number of Howitzers and Bomb-throwers delivered to date is 380.
MOVEMENTS OF ENEMY SHIPS.Two enemy merchant ships have this week arrived at and six have sailed from Merchant-Norwegian ports (outside the Cattegat).   None have arrived at or left Rotterdam, but men-four are said to have left Delfzyl for Swedish ports with enemy coal.FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. Italy.The situation in Venice has not altered. The Austrians are occupying ground right up to the left bank of the Sile between the Piave Vecchia and the sea and ,have strongly established themselves in the farm-houses in the vicinity, while the Italians occupy the opposite side of the Sile under the lee of the banks. There are no trenches on either side.The morale of the Italian Naval Brigade holding this part of the line is excellent, and efficient support has now been brought up on their left. The British monitors have established forward observation posts and have obtained good results and the success achieved is having a good effect on the personnel of the Italian floating batteries, which are now trying to emulate the British standard of gunnery. The Italians have lost one battery carrying two 4.7-inch guns, which was sunk by enemy fire; also a self-propelled pontoon capsized and sank off Ancona, but it is hoped to salve her guns, two of which are 15-inch.The Austrian Fleet has shown little activity during the last week and the raids on the Italian coast have not been repeated. The Deputy Chief of the Austrian Naval Staff has stated that the Austrian Navy can be regarded only as a support to the armies operating on the Italian and Balkan Fronts, and that it would only be used for defensive measures, owing to its inferior strategical position and to the superiority of the Allied Naval Forces.Portugal.In the Revolution which has just taken place the Portuguese Navy sided with the Government, now out of office, and bombarded Lisbon, causing some 100 deaths and many wounded. Commander Leote do Rego who has hitherto had entire control over the Portuguese Navy and Marines, and who is a strong supporter of the Allies, is now a refugee, and it seems likely that whatever organization and discipline has been main-tained in the Navy will collapse for the time being.If, as is not improbable, the Patrol trawlers and sweepers are withdrawn, the enemy may take the opportunity of laying mines off the Tagus, as was the case when Portugal entered the war. There are only 8 Sweepers and 6 Trawlers employed and the withdrawal of one or two would upset the whole organization.Russia.Admiral Stanley reports that he has given Captain Cromie (British Submarines) instructions to obey all orders from- the Russian Commander-in-Chief, who has ordered951 Merchant Vessels have now been fitted with Otter equipment, and the number Mine pro-of Warships fitted with Paravanes is 343. &apos;  &apos; . Section gear.An additional 40 vessels have been &quot; Dazzle Painted &quot; this week, bringing the total Dazzle number painted up to 409., A further vessel has been sunk during the past week, Painting, making a total loss of 10 of these.ships; 1,697 voyages have been completed to date./ /
hostilities to cease during the armistice. The British submarines are concentrating at Hango.At the end of October H.M.S. &quot;Intrepid &quot; and. other ships in the White Sea shifted their base from Pechenga to Yukanski.  Archangel is now frozen up.   &quot;Japan.The Japanese Patrol Vessel &quot; Hitachi Maru &quot; is missing and. it is suspected that she may have been captured by, and forced to accompany, a German raider, possibly the S.S. &quot; Wolf.&quot; A Japanese Light Cruiser from the Cape Station has returned to Durban after carrying out an unsuccessful search for the ship, and the S.S. &quot; Chikuzen Maru &quot; is now proceeding to the Maldive Islands with seaplanes to continue the search.Naval Staff,lUh December, 1917.[Appendices.
