I I S&quot;28I ?909.                       UAH GJ B IiJ 1 T.1 Copies of Telegrams exchanged between Admiralty rnd S-.N.0,jj Archangel.if Fvom :- S. No 0* Archangel. No. 12. .I Date   7.12.17;f To    :- Admiralty, sent   17,40 6thI red.     4.30 p.m.12c   Surest as follows : In my opinion Allied Embassies and Officials in Russia are in gravest danger,   Any outrage would necessitate immediate declaration of war against Russia which at present season of the year would be simply playing into, hands of Germany-     After careful consideration, I am of opinion the season is too far advanced for a campaign against Archangel and White Sea which are only points of attack open to us.     By the time ? any ? adequate navel force could be on its way to Archangel state af ice might prove formidable barrier.    I cannot undertake to hold &quot;IPHIOTflA&apos;1&apos;fixed in ice for.more than .&apos; a few days after hostilities begin*    Should hostilities.be averted until Spring there ifc little chance advance Archangel and 7/hite Sea generally being in better state than at present. -It is no use continuing fiaetion or not recognising TROTSKI or of attempting to prevent a separate peace.    Would therefere suggest consent of Allies being given to &quot;latter without stipulations and expressing only a-hope-neutrality will be observed..-     There can in no case be any guarantee that any stipulations will be observed and stipulations will be made pretext for prolonging negotiations only too - late to a/vert hostilities. At the same time there should be as ccmolete as possible Allied evacuation of Russia.Russia using MURMANSK as port of. embarkation.     It might be explained this is only temporary measure until Russia has settled (group omitted) telegranh at once.     I- submit it is absolutely necessary I should at once be fully infernsd ? (as to) policy you elect to pursue,     At my moment m hand may be &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; iorced ana this nas already nearly happened tnus precipitating waat I for one consider disastrous to&quot;the Allied caused     I earnestly beg no consideration&apos;, my comparatively humble position will prevent you placing this telecom before the Prime Minister and Cabinet.     I am repeating it to Admiral Stanley-v/ith suggestions that&apos;it may be laid before the Allied Ambassadors,
From To970.     Prom First Sea Lord.Your 12o   Can you get IPHI&amp;SNIa out of ice to Murmansk.   If bo make secret preparations for evacuating Archangel hut await further orders &quot;before moving unless circumstances render immediate move necessary.&apos;   Cabinet awaits joint report from Consul and yourself.First Sea Lord.
