^^^^^^ Department of information,SECRET.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; GNW/O05.&quot;^&quot;WEEKLY   REPORT   OH: NQRr7AY$   V. (Dec lftth, 1917)With further reference to the visit of the Scandinavian Kingsto Cbristiania (see Norway IV)   it is now reported that the visitwas arranged &quot;by Baron Ramel who was appointed with this objeottemporarily Swedish Minister to Norway, and has sinoe returned to&apos; daughter ofthe Foreign Offioe in Stockholm.    Baron Ramei married a/von Besen, wko was &quot;riofmarsohal&quot; to King Oscar.    The von Bssens have German connections, like many other families in Sweden, and Baron. Ramel . was f*r some years Secretary to the Swedish legation in Berlin.^fhen the consent of the King of Norway has been obtained, the King of Denmark, his brother, is stated to have offered on his own- - -&apos;--y-&apos;0     - : -:yyyyy --: /. -. , y-yy-i     - - &apos;&apos; .      ^yyyy -&apos; &apos; - -.-&quot; v.yy. ..:-      :      \ &apos; &apos; - &quot; :     y :V   -y-yyy;.,.-. &apos;y   - . .&quot;- - -:--&quot;&quot;---&quot;-v.- -account to come to Christiania at the same time.     There seems to^-y^yyyy-o&apos;^be little doubt that the visit of the King of Sweden to Nerway is due   to the influence of Germany, for it is evident that Germany is most anxious to hold Norway to Scandinavian co-eperation and also, should the Aaland Islanoi^uestion be discussed Sweden would try to gain the adhesion of the other 2 Scandinavian countries, to any German proposal.It is reported that the German Minister in Christiania has stated absolutely that the stoppage of exports from anyone of the Scandina-vian Countries, would be looked upon as un-Neutral by Germany, and that the King of Sweden is as German as ever, and regards Germany as invincible, and scoffs at the suggestion that any of the belli-gerents hafe ideas other then material.   The Queen of Sweden le t.u. Stockholm for Carlsruhe on the 6th inst. to visit her mother the Grand-Duchess louise, great-aunt of the Kaiser.
Mr. Ihlen, theJBorwegian JForeign Minister, is said to hare wel-corned the visit of the Zings as tending to relieve the attacks on himself in the Storting, where recently a vote of lack of confi-denoe was introduced against him.The attacks are due to his said laok of initiative in not having imported quantities of ooal and coke before the unlimited U. Boot warfare began, whereby two precious months were lost.   The same applies to the leak of petroleum for the fishing fleet which is much hampered in its eperations.     The loss to the country is estimated by some at 300.000.000 million sterling, but without details it is impossible to say htw so large a sum is arrived at.German propaganda in Norway has recently been making use of the &quot;Ukens Revy&quot; for the publication of articles reviling the Entente. One article on the U.Boot campaign is by Professor Gjelsvik, said in an editorial fiote to be &quot;Norway1a&quot; foremost and greatest au-thority 6n International Law&quot;.    The journal &quot;Hela Varlden&quot; CThe Whole World) published an article by Eira Hellberg on a journey to Serbia and contains among other things adulatory per-traits ef Mackensen, and the military Governer of Belgrade.Prom a good source it is stated that there are grounds for believing that the Russian Legation in Christiania is working in with the German legation.Molyichai-s^n, late Prime Minister of Norway, who was mainly responsible for the separation from Sweden, was recently summoned to give evidence in a spy case.     He pointed out how difficult the position of Norway was, and said that he had explained to Germany, what bitterness was caused by the torpedoing of Norwegian ships, with consequent destructions to life, when the sailors were only trying to supply the country with the bare necessaries of life. The British authorities, he considered, had in different domains treatec1 Norwegian authority as if it did not exist.
The Norwegian Press is pretesting against a &quot;fisheries agree-ment&quot; with this country whereby Norway is premitted to exportout15$ of her catch to Germany.   It is pointed/that under this agree-ment, which does not deal with oanned fish. Germany is enabled to receive 30$ of Norway&apos;s fish amounting to 150.000 tons.    A country which exports so much fish should be suffering from no shortage. Perhaps Norway, they say, is sending Great Britain fish in exchange for other commodities?   In this case it would be interesting to know how much and how regularly.    Arrangements have been made, especially with America, that owing to shortage, some food be sent to Norway, but as this is the case the statement of the Norwegian paper is provocative of some misgiving, the more so as it is added that this export to Germany is taking plaoe under a secret agreemt ment   with the Ministry of Blockade.  leading Swedish financial Journal recently drew attention to the danger threatening the Scandinavian countries should a separate peace between Russia and Germany be followed by intimate commercial relations between those 2 countries.     This, it says, woujd oon-stitute an immenent political danger for the Northern Countries, as thereby an overwhelming pressure in Scandinavian countries oould be exercised.    Such a partial solution of the world crisis would be* come the worst possible for the latter, as Germany would be in a position not only to regain but also immensely to increase her con-trolling influence over Russian Commerce and industry.     The hopes of Scandinavian expansion in the Russian markets would then we definitely lost./n invention which seems to be of considerable value is reprin-ted in the Norwegian paper of Nov. 13.     It concerns a range-finder invented by Lt. Colonel Andersen, which he has just delivered to the American Government.     The paper describes it as one of the finest
inventions in the world, because it is so superior to all similar instruments.     In consequence of an $pen competition in America 2 years ago for the best ragge finder, the prize was given to one Lewis, but his instrument htd a variation of 1$ or 100 yards in 10.000, and over this distance was practically of no value, whereas the Anderson instrument is stated to have a variation of only i per 1000, or in 20.000 yards a difference of 10 yards.   Another invention ef his, he called &quot;telepointage&quot; which if it does what it promised, will it is said revolutionise not only the shooting from coast batteries, but also thowe on board ships.    Trials in. Norway gave good results, but now it is said that arrangements have been made &quot;with a foreign gun factory&quot; to give the system a thorough trial,Complainte are being made in Norway of the repudiation without notice by England of an agreement regarding the importation of hides and skins.More Norwegian vessels are reported sunk by torpedoes.
