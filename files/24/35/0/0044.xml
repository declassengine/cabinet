In particular I think there is great force in Mr* Hayes Fisher&apos;s view that it is impracticable tc lay down hard and fast standardised rules to be applied automatic-ally by the exempting bodies, and that it is inexpedient to restrict the powers of Tribunals* 3c     As regards registration, the proposals of the . Ministry of National Service have been discussed between the Local Government Board, the Ministry of National Service, and my Department.      The conclusion at which we arrived is that legislation offers the best means of attaining what is desired.4f,    I concur in Mr, Hayes Fisher&apos;s view that there is only a limited scope for recruiting men of physical fitness from general industry and trade, and that the protected industries must be looked to for the majority of tho recruits desiredc I must add, however, that if more men are withdrawn from Agriculture, at any rate in Scotland, I gravely doubt whether the programme desired and required in 1918 can bo, carried out. 5,    Correlation of our position with that of our Allies, especially of the United States, seems to me to be of groat importance.-.
