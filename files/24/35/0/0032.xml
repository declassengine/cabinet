NOTES ON THE PRESENT RUSSIAN SITUATION.. The following points have to be specially kept in view::-(1.).. The safety of our &amp;abassy in Petrograd and of British subjects in Russia;(2). The interests of Romania and her Army.;(3), The best course to adopt in order to diminish a* i^zh ds possible t&amp;e advajitage which Germany will be able to extract from the dissolution of the Russian Army as a fighting force,Thasd subjects are all intersconnected, though so far as possible I will doal with them separately.(1). The greatest danger to Sir George Buchanan and the British Colony arises probably out of the possibility of mob-violence, excited by the anti*British propaganda fomented by German /money in Petrograd and elsewhere.   The only real security against this is to be found either by the establishment of a strong and order-loving Government in Russia, or by the removal of the British..: o f ieialThe first we can do nothing&apos; to socurs..  The second cannot bo obtained unless wo are abls* (a) to provide the necessary transport either through Sweden or through some northern port of Russia, and (b) to win the goodwill (in however qualified a form)&apos; of the present rulers of PetrogradcTho -question of transport is hardly a Foreign Office matter, but the policy of avoiding&quot; the &quot;active malevolence of tho Bolshevist Party raisosjaost important&apos; diplomatic issues.It was suggested at Ca i&amp;ct on Friday thctr, after theirroc out
recent proclamations, the Bolshevists could only be re-garded as avowed enemies, and to treat them as anythingelce showed a lamentable incapacity to see facts as theyare, and to handle them with decision.I entirely dissent from this view, and believe it tohe founded on a misconception. If, for the moment, theBolshevists show peculiar virulence in dealing with theBritish Empire, it is probably because they think that theBritish Empire is the great obstacle to immediate peace.But they -are fanatics to whom the Constitution of everyState, whether monarchical or republican, is equally odiousTheir appeal is to every revolutionary force/ economic,Social, racial, or religious, which can be used Jro upsetthe existing Political organisations of mankind. If theysummon the Mahometans of India to revolt, they are stillmore desirous of engineering a revolution in Germany. Theyare-dangerous dreamers,, whose power, be it great or small,transitory or permanent, depends partly on German gold,partly on the determination of the-Russian Army to fight no more; but who would genuinely, like to. put into practice the wild theories which have so long been germinating in the shadow of the Russian Autocracy,Now, contrary to the opinion of some of my ColleaguesI am clearly of opinion that it is to our advantage to aivid as long as possible, an open breach with this crazy system. If this be&quot; drifting, then I am a drifter by deliberate policy. On the broader reasons for my view, I will say a word directly, but its bearing on&quot; the narrower issue of the safety of Sir George Buchanan and the British Colony is evident. I am personally of opinion that the cabinet -should reverse the decision it came to some little time ago, and should deport&quot; to Russia the two interned Russian subjects in whose fate the Russian rulers appear to be so greatly interested. I was not in England whenthe
^^^^the decision to retain them vns cone to, and I am^ perfectly acquainted with the reasons for it.   Doubtless they were sufficient.   But I certainly think that we may now with advantage- send these two Russians hack to their own country,; where, judged by local&apos; standards, their opinions will probably appear sane and moderate,I have already instructed Sir George Buchanan to abstain&quot;completely from any action which can be interpreted &quot;as an undue interference with the internal affairs of the country to which ho is aceredited,and I am unable to think of any oth.$r step which would help to secure his Safety,(2).   As regards the Roumanian Army, events have marchr ed rapidly. Everything that could be done&apos;,,   even as a for^  -lorn hope, has boon done to enable the Army to join with oth-.r forces in Russia prepared to continue the struggle,but for the moment no such forces appear to exist,and the&apos;Rournan-ian Army is und-T the strictest military necessity of ao quiescing in the armistice, or rather the cessation of lies-tilities , on its part of the line.V&quot;.ry -difficult and important questions,such as those raised by General Berthelot in a Memorandum I have ordered to be circulated, still remain tor be decided;but these call for no immediate action. 1 hope that General BertheloVs Memorandum will he carefully considered by the Headquarters buai j. 0(&quot;0.1 have already indicated my view that we ought,if possible, not to come to an open breach with the Bolshevists, or drive them- into the enemas campBBut there are wider reasons for this policy than the safety of tho British Colony in Russia,   ThvSo wider reasons ar*: as follows:It is certain,I take itrth.-.tr for the remainder ofthis
tails war, the Bolshevists are- going to fight.. Jioi ther--Germa,v nor any one else.   But, if we can prevent their aiding Germany, we do a great deal, and to this we should devote * our efforts.There are two possicle advantages which Germany mayextract from Russia1 s going out of the war:, (i) She mayincrease her man-power in other theatres of operation bymoving troops from the Russian Front, or by getting backGerman prisoners.- There id little hope of stopping this,andI say no more about it.- (ii) She may obtain the power ofusing the largo potential resources of Russia to break theAllied Blockade.^ I am not sure that this is not the moreimportant of the.two advantages, and it has so far boon veryimperfectly examined,   as regards ell 5 vve want to- know wnaomeans of transport there is in the Black Sea available tothe Germans, and how far the anti-Bolshevist elements in theCaucasian regions can be utilised to ihterforo with thosupply on land. As regard a cereals., the difficulties, theGermans are likely to have arises mainly, I suppose, fromthe chaotic condition of the country, the disorganisationof all means of transport, and tho determination of theRussians to use their own produce for their own purposes,Russia &apos;If wc drive/into the hands of Germany, we shall hasten the organisation pf -the country by German officials on German lines.   Nothing could be more fatal, it seems to me, both to the immdiate conduct of the war and to our post-war relations.Russia, however incapable of fighting, is not easily over-run.   Escept with, the active goodwill of the Russians themselves, German troops(even if there were German troops to spare) are not going to penetrate, many hundreds of miles into that v st countryc   a more armistice between Russia andGermany
Germany may not for very many months promote in any important fashion the supply of German needs from . Russian sources.. It must be our business to make that period as long as possible by every means in our power, and no policy-would be more fatal than to give the Russians a motive for welcoming into their midst Gorman officials and German soldiers as friends--and. dolivecrorB.A.J, BALPOUS.FOREIGN OFFI-CEySUNDAY, 9th December 1917
