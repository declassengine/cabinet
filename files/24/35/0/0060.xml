RACING DURING IKE WINTER.With reference to the Memorandum of the 7th December circulated by the Pood Controller on the subject of feeding of oats to horses engaged in winter racing, I think that the War Cabinet should know that the Stewards of the National Hunt Committee; approached the Board of Trade some time ago on tho question of what amount of racing could take place under National Hunt Rules during the winter season.     The Board of Trade consulted the Ministry-of Munitions and the War Office in the natter, and also the Railway Executive Committee.     The latter body were at first of opinion that no facilities whatever could be given for racing during the winter, and the Stewards of the National Hunt Committee were informed accordingly.     They, however, again approached the Board of Trade and put forward a scheme under which any demands upon Railway Companies would be reduced to a minimyni; and, in the circumstances, the Railway Companies withdrew their objection to a limited amount of racing during the winter months.     The Ministry of Munitions and tho War Office were consulted on the programme proposed, and both Departments agreed to it.The main consideration which was taken into account in the communications with the Stewards was the necessity of avoiding any strain on the Railways through the carriage of passengers and horses to and from race meetings, and nothing took place during the negotiations to lead the Stewards to Buppose that the arrangement arrived at with them covered in any way the question of licences to allow horses engaged at race meetings under their Rules to receive a ration of oats.A.H.
