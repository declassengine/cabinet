SECRETREPORT BY G.O.C., R.F.C .. , ON AERIAL OPERATIONS IN THE NANCY AREA.The OCHEY Aerodrome in the NANCY Area at which our night bombing aeroplanes are situated has bee:: bombed several times by the enemy without much damage being done,,3n the night 5rd/4th the enemy bombed&apos;OCHEY during most of the night and slightly damaged 15 of our machines all of which will he serviceable to-night,    They also hit the sheds occupied by the French Squadrons; and completely destroyed 10 of their machines and damaged 17.Last night they bombed the aerodrome again without doing any damage to any of our machines; although they did a certain amount of damage to the French sheds.   All our machines had been placed outside the sheds.When I was home on the 28th November, Colonel Newall and myself both informed General Smuts at the Air Council meeting that the French had not agreed to our bombing German Aerodromes in this neighbourhood when we first went there,-but they had agreed to our bombing them if the Germans bombed us a third time.   This has now been done, but the French want us to be perfectly certain that ive only bomb that aerodrome from whloh the German machines that bomb OCHEY come.     This, however, is almost impossible to know as the enemy moves his machines every night.I anticipate, however, to get over this difficulty with the French to-night.,(Sd) K. TRENCHARD,Major General, Commanding Royal Flying Corps H.Q., R.F.C. &quot;     in the Field,6.12.17.
