[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1917.SECRET.G.T.-2952.THE LABOUR SITUATION.Report from the Ministry of Labour for the Week ending the 12th December, 1917.Summary.Part I: General Remarks.The position of the Shop Stewards&apos; movement is discussed, with special reference to the Coventry strike.Part II: Press Opinions.The &quot; Herald &quot; prints a virulent attack upon the Government. The censor-ship of pamphlets, Lord Lansdowne&apos;s letter, and food questions, engage general attention in the Labour press.Part ill: District Reports.The situation in the West Midlands is restless, in the North-Western districts it is unsatisfactory, and in Scotland seriously disturbed.Part IV: Disputes.(a.) Involving Stoppage. There are no strikes of serious importance. The Furness Railway craftsmen&apos;s strike is only important owing to a possibility of sympathetic action in Barrow.(b.) Not Involving Stoppage. With the exception of disputes on the question of the 12^ per cent, advance, and the claims of the rivetters on the Clyde, there are no serious disputes in progress.I. General Remarks. The Shop Stewards&apos; Movement.It was immediately apparent that the Conference now sitting at Coventry to consider the question of the recognition of the shop stewards, and to decide their position in the constitution of trade unionism, deals with matters of national importance, and, recognising this fact, George Peet, of Gorton, Secretary of the National Amalgamation Committee, called an emergency conference of shop stewards in Manchester. This conference sat on the 5th and 6th instant, and comprised a -representative body of leading shop stewards from all parts of the country. The brains of the movement were there assembled, the company including Parkinson and Sharpe, of Barrow; Roscoe and Kealey, of Manchester; Lismer and Murphy, of Sheffield; Dingley, of Coventry; and GaUacher, of Dalmuir.The meeting commenced by an affirmation demanding that they should be represented at any conference called to discuss the status of shop stewards, and a telegram was despatched to-the address of the Minister of Labour, conveying the resolution. In reply, it was pointed out that the Conference was called by the Federation of Employers and by the Allied Trades, who only had the power to select their representatives.   The original peremptory demand of the Committee[11U0-S] B
was somewhat modified in their answer to this telegram, though the allegation was repeated that the findings of the Conference could not be recognised.As was the case at the Newcastle conference, held in October last, the tempera-ment of the Conference appears to have mellowed as discussion progressed, and the resolutions finally adopted at the second day&apos;s meeting were remarkable for their moderation.   The broad principles of recognition adopted were the following: (1.) That employers shall have no jurisdiction over the action of the shop stewards.(2.) That the shop stewards shall be the first medium to negotiate with on allquestions arising in shops. (3.) That any proposed innovation or change in shop practice shall first benotified to the shop stewards of the department concerned, through theconvenor of shop stewards.The meeting also passed resolutions congratulating Coventry on its fight on the subject of recognition, but deploring any policy of &quot; down tools &quot; until a national strike can be arranged, and condemning the proposals of the Whitley Eeport.It cannot be recognised too clearly that the question now under discussion at Coventry is of the greatest national importance. On its decision will, in a large measure, depend industrial peace, not only at Coventry, but at every centre of industry throughout the Kingdom. It is in some ways unfortunate that a question of such importance should have to be decided at a time when the hands of both sides are tied by national necessity, but on the other hand, that fact may result in an amount of mutual forbearance, which might be absent in normal times.It is clear that nothing short of recognition will be accepted by the shop stewards generally, and that a failure&apos; of the Conference may mean a strike in all those places where the shop stewards are powerful, notably in Barrow, Manchester, and Sheffield, and probably also on the Clyde.If a scheme is agreed upon which definitely recognises the shop steward as a part of the trade union machinery, it will do much to put an end to the prevalent unrest in the engineering trade, and will make for peace after the war, always provided that the trade unions are able to assert their authority, and are not ousted by the National Amalgamation Committee^ which is developing as the central organisation of the shop stewards. If a really comprehensive scheme is evolved, however, this need not be regarded as a very serious danger.II. Press Opinions.An Attack on the Government.The &quot;Herald,&quot; of the 8th December, is a remarkable issue of that paper for several reasons. Among other features, it contains a most virulent attack on the present Government, under the title &quot; J&apos;Accuse.&quot; This attack is printed in a series of paragraphs, to each of which special prominence has been given by printing it separately and conspicuously in the centre of a page of other matter. Each para-graph contains separate heads of charge, which in sum cover the whole range of Government action and alleged inaction.   The following extracts are typical: &apos;&apos; We charge you with being muddlers. You have not known how to make war. You do not know how to make peace. You have always accused others of being too late : you have always been too late yourselves.   .   . -.&quot; We charge you with permitting and condoning the continued exploitation of the people of this country by the profiteers. . . You have revived under a new guise the old Corn Law. You have endowed and established by statute the landlord and agrarian interest at the expense of the workers.   .   .       .&quot; We charge you with having broken pledge after pledge given to Labour, and with having repaid the sacrifices of the workers with double-dealing and with unjust reproaches.   .   .   .&quot; We charge you with being the main obstacles in this country to a reasonable peace. You have allowed the war, which the people embraced as a war for freedom, to become tainted with imperialism and commercial ambition. . . . You have said &apos; Liberty, justice, honour!&apos;   You have meant &apos; Persia, Mesopotamia, Africa!&apos;&quot; We charge you with having used powers granted you for the prosecution of the war to persecute your political opponents, tn suppress criticism of your conduct, and to destroy the personal liberties of the people.
I He Censorship of Leaflets.The agitation on the subject of the censorship of leaflets, continues to be wide-spread and forcible. The &quot;Bradford Pioneer &quot; publishes a short catechism on the subject, which includes the following: &quot; What does all this mean&quot;? It means that the Government can suppress criticism of its conduct of the war. It means that the people must not have a voice in determining national policy. &apos; It means the establishment of a Government dictatorship of thought and opinion.   This is a public scandal and an outrage on all our cherished liberties.&quot;The &quot;Merthyr Pioneer &quot; considers that the suggested amendment, according to which copies of leaflets or pamphlets, instead of being submitted to the Censor for approval, should be deposited at his office, is inadequate. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; supports this view.   It says: &quot; There is no objection to the Government retaining the power to prosecute the writers and publishers of leaflets which are clearly seditious, but our objection is to a Government official or a police officer having the power to determine whether a leaflet is or is not illegal. That is a matter which should be decided by a Court of Law.&quot;The &quot; Call,&quot; while welcoming the suggested amendment as far it goes, con-siders that it still leaves the regulations objectionable.The &quot; Yorkshire Factory Times &quot; calls upon the Labour Party in Parliament to attack the regulation, and writes: &quot; It is the Governments attack upon the freedom of the common people, and there ought to be a general outcry against the regulation, in so far that it means that Northcliffe, and Carson, and Milner, and all the anti-Labour crowd can write what they have a mind, but that Labour leaders and social reformers who dare to explain the ethics of the New Testament from the Gospel and humanity are to be handicapped and checked in every sensible endeavour they make.&quot;Lord Lansdowne&apos;s Letter.The Labour press of the week has commented with great fulness on Lord Lansdowne&apos;s letter to the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;; with its proposals the majority of papers are in hearty concord.The &quot; Herald &quot; publishes, under the title &quot; Lansdowne Leads who follows? &quot; a symposium of views from prominent persons of different schools of thought, all of whom express views appreciative of the letter. Among these are Mr. H. W. Nevinson, Mr. R,. D. Holt, Mr. Pringle, and Mr. Israel Zangwill, also Mr. Austin Harrison.As to the letter, the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; writes: &quot; . . . The war will continue until saner men assert themselves and rally the common sense of the peoples to a reasonable and practical policy. Lord Lansdowne&apos;s letter is a valuable contribution to that vital need. Mr. Bonar Law is&apos; quite right in regarding Lord Lansdowne&apos;s letter as mischievous. It is mischievous in the sense . . . that it is a challenge to the mischief in press and politics which is ignorantly and wantonly continuing the war for no useful purpose.&quot;In discussing Lord Lamsdowne&apos;s reference to the freedom of the seas, the &quot; Leicester Pioneer,&quot; a pacifist journal, is curiously unsympathetic.  It says: -Many people who are in general sympathy with Lord Lansdowne&apos;s plea .... regret that he should have used a phrase which embodies an attempt by Germany to becloud the issue. . . . Discussion will very largely turn on that phrase, and this is unfortunate. . . . One may be forgiven, indeed, for wishing that Lord Lansdowne had consulted some of his political friends before he went into print.&quot;&quot;Forward,&quot; welcomes the letter on the ground of its tone, but has a most moderate article on the subject. In discussing the desirability of a statement of war aims it comments: &quot; As has been remarked in these notes more than once, there are two quarters from which frankness and clearness of aims are required, Germany and the Pacifists. . . . From the general declarations of Mr. Asquith at the beginning of the war down to the Allied Note to President Wilson in January of this year, the Allies have stated their aims with a clearness which it is high time that Germany imitated. ... In every one of these aims the lack of distinctness is not on the side of the Allies.&quot;The &quot;Clarion&quot; and &quot;Justice&quot; are wholeheartedly opposed to Lord Xansdowne&apos;s views, and regret the publication of the letter.
-APeace Writings.The &quot;Herald&quot; publishes an important article by Mr. Arthur Henderson, entitled &quot; No Sliding Scale Peace.&quot; The general tone of the article may be gathered from the following extract: &quot; We do not want a sliding-scale peace, the terms of which rise when our arms are successful in the field, and fall when the military situation is temporarily adverse to us. We want a firm statement, subject to no fluctuations according to the ebb and flow of victory, of the aims based on the principles of mankind we are bound to insist upon, and a repudia-tion frank, explicit, and formal of the knock-out blow.&quot;A Labour Government.Inspired by Lord Lansdowne&apos;s letter, the &quot; Herald &quot; has a leading article suggesting that the time has come for a coalition Government of a different kind.&quot; It is easy now to frame an alternative Cabinet. Mr. Henderson and Lord Lansdowne would be the nucleus inevitably; Mr. Thomas and Mr. Clynes, to name two out of many, would speak sanely and constructively for Labour. Instead of &apos; business men &apos; big Labour leaders from outside Parliament men of sagacity, of vision, of experience like Mr. Robert Smillie could be called in. Lords Morley, and Loreburn, and Buckmaster among Liberals, Lord Parmoor and Lord Henry Bentinck among Unionists, are obvious names.&quot;To these the paper adds General Smuts and Lord Grey, as possible candidates. It does not pretend that such a combination would be perfect, but considers that, in the present circumstances of the country, the men named would probably prove the best for a practical Government working on lines approved by the &quot; Herald.&quot;The Government Labour Committee.The constitution of this Committee is attacked in tlie &quot; Herald &apos;&apos; on the ground that it contains no member who can be regarded as a representative of Labour.Shop Stewards&apos; Committees.The Coventry strike has given rise to a considerable amount of comment in the press generallv, and the Labour press in particular, on the subject of shop stewards. Generally, it is suggested that recognition is inevitable, on the ground that shop stewards&apos; committees are practically identical with the workshop committees proposed in the Whitley Report.The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; writes: The shop steward is a very admirable and useful.institution. There is no doubt tiiat in the industrial organisation of the future he will occupy a very important position and exercise a great amount of influence. The Whitley Committee recommended the kind of workshop organisation for which the Coventry engineers have been contending in their strike. . . . The outcome of the conference which is to be held will afford an oppor-tunity for testing the goodwill of the employers. . . . An ounce of practical concession will be worth a ton cf sympathy.&quot;The &quot;Bradford Pioneer &quot; considers that the cause of the stoppage in a most vital industry seems to have been most inadequate, but that the reason given by the employers for refusal to recognise the shop stewards, namely, that the question was of national importance, was of the flimsiest description.The &quot; New Witness&quot; considers that the men have suffered serious injustice through the failure. to recognise the shop stewards as their representatives, but does not doubt that they will sacrifice their own interests for the sake of the war.Food.Discussing &quot; The Sugar Muddle,&quot; the &quot; Call &quot; writes: May the Fates preserve us from any system of rationing that will be administered by the present Food Control Board.&quot;The &quot; Leicester Pioneer &apos;&apos; prints a long critical article on the food position, attacking the Food Controllers methods of dealing with cereals, potatoes, milk, and meat, in detail, and suggesting- that his&quot; action has been influenced by tender-ness for vested interests, and the feelings of the &quot; profiteer.&quot;&quot;Common. Sense&quot; has a series of letters from special correspondents in provincial centres, dealing with food conditions there. The following is from the&apos; Cardiff letter: &quot; In South Wales, owing to the difficulty of securing adequate supplies of margarine, &amp;c, corners are going to work with only dry bread in their boxes.   &apos; That,&apos; says a well-
known miners&apos; leader, &apos; cannot last long.&apos; . . . Mr. Vernon Hartshorn says: &apos; Unless a vital change in policy is adopted in the near future I have no doubt that the consequences will be serious, if not disastrous.&apos; &quot;- From Bristol and Birmingham distressing reports of the difficulty of securing food, and descriptions of the crowded queues at provision shops are published.The &quot; Herald,&quot; the &quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; and the &quot; Call,&quot; harp on the question of fashionable restaurants.The &quot; Leeds Citizen &quot; prints an attack on the profiteers, giving details of war profits in the case of shipping and tea companies, and is specially hostile to the farmers on the score of meat and milk prices.   The article ends: &quot; You can get plenty of food yet, so why grumble? You have only to walk into any hotel or restaurant to get a delightful meal. The little trouble is that those who need it most can&apos;t pay the price, and have to keep out while the few enjoy many good things. Such is England, the land of the free, in the time of a war of principles and ideals, in which democracy is at stake, protected by the people who ape the Huns.&quot;The &quot;Woolwich Pioneer &quot; suggests that the whole of the rationing of the nation should be done on co-operative lines, with a central committee on a national basis.&quot;Justice&quot; again attacks the Food Control Department on the ground of the &quot;sugar muddle.&quot;III. District Reports.London.Members of the Electrical Trades Union are displaying considerable agitation about the 12\ per cent, increase. Regarding this, a meeting was recently held at the Holborn Hall, and it is understood that if their request is not granted they intend to call a general strike of all electrical engineers throughout the country, including those at munition works.There is still dissatisfaction at Woolwich concerning the alleged shortage of food. The women workers are demanding an increase of pay to meet the high cost of living.The grant of the 12^ per cent, advance has caused much satisfaction in Messrs. Cubitt&apos;s works.West Midlands.This district is restless. Reports indicate that Lord Lansdowne&apos;s letter in the &quot; Daily Telegraph &quot; has caused much comment amongst workers in Birmingham, who have been favourably impressed by his views, and are likely to support them, should the opportunity present itself.The shortage of food is also causing much disquiet, and at a local meeting of the National Union of Railwaymen a strong protest was made against women and children having to stand in queues during the cold weather to secure necessary foodstuffs.Unrest is also manifest amongst electrical workers. The Birmingham Corpora-tion electrical employees are stated to have handed in notices to expire on the 14th instant, failing the grant of 25 per cent, increase in wages.Coventry continues to remain quiet, but with reference to the recent strike, two interesting facts have been revealed.(1.) That absolutely no evidence was forthcoming to prosecute the strikers, who behaved in a most orderly manner, the number of police court cases during the strike being actually less than normal.(2.) The praiseworthy efforts made by the Coventry branch of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Soldiers and Sailors to induce their members, who were trade unionists, to return to work.Yorkshire and East Midlands.Apart from the anxiety as to the food situation this district is apparently quieter. No serious labour troubles are anticipated until after the Christmas holidays.[1100-8] &apos; 0
t)Spea,king at a poorly-attended meeting of Leeds Trades Council and Leeds Labour Party, Mr. Hyndman delivered a very virulent attack upon the Government. The following sample of his remarks is quoted : &quot;I am disgusted with the corruption and imbecility amongst the governing classes of the country.   The House of Commons is a den of thieves.&quot;The speaker was much heckled.In Sheffield there is some discontent in the building trades owing to their exclusion from the 12^ per cent, advance. The question of the recognition of Shop Stewards here, as in every industrial area, is the subject of much comment.North- Western.The situation in this area is not satisfactory. It is thought that the restlessness amongst the workers may be due to the Manchester National Emergency Conference of the National Amalgamated Committee of the Shop Stewards and Workers Com mittee Movement, where the meeting between the Government and the employers and Trade Union leaders to consider the future status of Shop Stewards, was dis-cussed. From the general tone of the Manchester Conference it was gathered that unless the Government allowed the Shop Stewards to be represented when their future status was discussed very serious industrial trouble would result.The Furness Railway dispute is discussed in Section IV, but in passing it should be noted that from all reports the longer the strike remains unsettled the more chance there is of Messrs. Vickers&apos; men being implicated.In spite of the restlessness amongst a large section of the people of Barrow, the quieter element in the town is expressing a desire for a further meeting like the one addressed by Mr. G. N. Barnes last month under the auspices of the War Aims Committee.Northern.This district continues to remain quiet, although at Sunderland the 12^ per cent, advance is causing a certain amount of dissatisfaction amongst the moulders on piece work.A notable expression of opinion was made this week at Newcastle by a Trade Unionist, who states that it might be desirable to threaten to withdraw the exemp-tion cards of all men of the military age who go on strike. This might appear somewhat drastic, but he considered that it would have a very salutary effect on the 3rounger and more turbulent section of the agitators.W ales.The situation in South Wales is rather better. In the coal districts, however, pacifism is still greatly in evidence.Scotland.Throughout this area there are indications of serious unrest. As was indicated last week the Pacifist parties on the Clyde are growing more powerful. It is stated that on the 23rd instant an extensive demonstration will be held in Glasgow by all the Socialist parties in favour of the release of Petroff and other interned Russians in this country. Moreover, a picked bodyguard is being organised to resist the police or military if necessary.A bad impression is alleged to have been created amongst the workers at Park-head and district owing to Messrs. Beardmore having discharged the whole of their employees from the East Hope Street Factory. It will be remembered that a strike occurred there amongst the women workers owing to the dismissal of four female shop stewards. This strike was brought to an end on the understanding that the matter would be referred to arbitration. Further, engineers applying for work at Parkhead are stated to have been kept waiting several days until the firm had taken up their references and communicated with the previous employers. It is main-tained that this is in opposition to the spirit of the removal of the leaving certifi-cates.
IV. Disputes. (a.) Involving a stoppage, of. work.There is no serious strike to note this week. The most important one, and one which may have the most far-reaching results, is that of the craftsmen on the Furness Railway.The strike arose over the question of district rates, the men contending that they are striking as engineers, not as railwaymen. On Friday last the management offered the men&apos;s leders 2s. less than the district rate, or alternative arbitration. Both these offers were declined unanimously. The men involved are only 170; but the significance lies in the fact-that the longer the men remain out the more attention they attract; and there is a grave possibility of Vickers&apos; men deciding to take an active part. Without doubt the railway craftsmen have this object in view. Already the Barrow shop stewards are supporting the strikers, who have been guaranteed their wages. The trade union officials in the shipyard have also decided to give them their moral support.A report has to-day (13th December) been received, that the men will resume work to-morrow, on condition of an early settlement of the question at issue.Midland sheet metal workers to the number of 4,000, who had struck work on a question of wages, resumed work on the 6th December pending settlement of difficulties in detail by the help of the Ministry of Munitions.The Shipyard Labour Department has three new cases of strike to report.What might have been a serious dispute occurred at the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Enginering Company. Here turners and fitters passed a resolution to &quot; down tools &quot; unless the men working on piece work or premium bonus received the 12^ per cent, advance or, as an alternative, that the men were put on time work. There was considerable restlessness amongst the men, and a serious strike was thought probable. After a half-day&apos;s strike, however, the trouble was settled by the firm offering to&apos; adjust the piece rates.Between 200 and 300 rivetters of the same firm have ceased work until the Committee of Production announce their decision regarding rivetting rates. An early resumption of work is anticipated.Of the three stoppages of work reported by the Coal Controller this week, two have been settled.The only outstanding strike, that of the Bedlay Colliery, Lanarkshire, presents many difficulties in the way of settlement. There is much bad feeling, and it is feared that the stoppage may be prolonged.The War Office Contracts Department has only one new case of stoppage to report.A somewhat serious strike has taken place amongst Bussian Jew pressers in the clothing trade at Liverpool on account of the proposed transference of rates of pay from a time to a piece basis.   The strike is affecting numerous workers in the same trade.In addition to the settlement of the strike in the Midlands already described, the Ministry of Munitions reports six other cases of stoppage, all but one of which have been settled.A strike is proceeding at Middlesbrough, where gas producer men, members of the National Amalgamated Union of Labour, allege the non recognition of their Union.   Work, however, has not been brought to a standstill.(b.) Not involving a stoppage of work.The question of the 12-1 Per cent. still continues to figure prominently in labour disputes. As to Glasgow, satisfactory information has been received from the Ministry of Munitions to the effect that several disputes affecting the 12^ per cent, bonus have been successfully negotiated.In Manchester, however, the 12^ per cent, order is not so successful.There have been 194 controversial cases respecting wages and conditions of labour under investigation by the Shipyard Labour Department during the past week. As was reported last week, the more important disputes have taken place on the Clyde. Further disputes here are feared. Rivetters are responsible for most of the trouble, and complain of the delay which is taking place in settling their price lists.Five new cases of dispute are reported by the Coal Controller, making a total of seventeen.   One outstanding dispute has been settled.A dispute has arisen at a small colliery in Scotland regarding the payment of the war wage dining time lost on account of bad trade., The employers admit liability, but refuse to pay on financial grounds. They have now been definitely instructed by the Coal Controller to pay the amount due.
War Office Contracts Department announce five new cases of dispute, chiefly connected with the Clothing Trade.It is stated that the precise scope of the award of the 4th October by the-Committee of Production in the clothing trade is giving rise to difficulties. Allied trades such as shirt-making, cap-making, and light sewings are claiming that the award applies to them. The Committee of Production is being asked for rulings on typical cases.TJie Chief Industrial Commissioner&apos;s Department announces that 120 new reports of differences have been received during the week ended the 8th December.In the building trades there have been a number of district applications for advances in wages among others for South Wales, Bristol, and Blackburn districts.Differences have also arisen out of claims for payment for lost time owing to bad weather. Among reports of differences in the pig-iron and iron and steel trade industry may be mentioned differences between the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation and the Amal-gamated Society of Steel and Iron Workers of Great Britain on the one hand, and the Scottish Steelmakers&apos; Wages Association, regarding a claim of the gasmen employed in the Scottish steel works for a recognised meal bonus, and a claim for time and a half for their members when working for the four days following New Year&apos;s Day in Glasgow Fair Hobday.The Committee of Production during the last week heard twenty-two arbitra-tion cases in London and seven in Glasgow.The cases in Glasgow were applications made by the Boilermakers&apos; Society for increased rates on standard ships on the Clyde and at Dundee, also for increased rates on merchant-work on the Clyde.D. j.
