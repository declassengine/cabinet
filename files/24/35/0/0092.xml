SUMMARY OP BLOCKADI INFORMATION 7th - 13th Dec. 1917........-iiiiiiiwwiwiiim*i &quot;mp&quot; i iiT-ri iitti -i- mmm i KMi1&apos; NORWAY. The Norwegian Government rejected the proposalsof the United States War Board for a general agreement, and nave put forward counter-proposals.     They decline to prohibit the export to Germany of fish, oil, carbide, pyrites, calcium nitrate, ferro-silicon or molybdenum as required by the War Board.        They desire to export to Germany at least 18,000 tons of calcium nitrate, 15,000 tons of carbide, 4,000 tons of ferro-silicon, 50 tons of molybdenum., and 300 tons of fish oil.     The export to Germany of pyrites should, they consider, be sanctioned under the Copper Agreement along with the export of crude and refined copper.Meanwhile Mr. ihlen has asked us to support him in a request to the United Ststes Government for supplies of pdbro-leum for the Norwegian fisheries.    He has naturally been in-formed that we cannot do so until Norway has come to a satis-factory understanding with the United States.     Mr. Ihlen thereupon stated that the proposals of the War Board were too drastic and would have to be resisted if Norway intended to preserve her neutrality.    He even spoke of prohibiting all exports to the Allies except in compensation for supplies imported from overseas.     It is significant that this stiffen-ing of the Norwegian attitude follows closely upon -fee meeting of the Scandinavian Kings.     The upshot is that the Norwegian negotiations at Washington have again reached a deadlock.v$2. SWBPgtt.        The Swedish delegates attending the London conferences will be empowered to place at the disposal of the Allies some two-thirds of the Swedish tonnage which is available and suitable ibr ocean services.        The Swedes would require in fcetura facilities for their imports from overseas includingD/HS/699 KB.^11
2.346coal.    Sir E. Howard is unable to say how the Swedish Govern-ment will induce the Swedish shipowners to charter their ships in dangerous trades at reasonable rates.   IDhey do not apparently propose to employ legal compulsion and it is doubtful whether they are prepared to enforce maximum freights or to take over-the insurance of the vessels at full value.DBHMABK. lijne Danish exports of bacon and butter in Septemberand October were fairly equally divided between Germany and Great Britain,    Germany received 3,047 tons of bacon and 2,192 tons of butter;    Great Britain received 3,395 tons of bacon and  677 tons of butter.     Germany on the other hand received 11,119 tons of Danish meat whereas &amp;e meat was exported to the United Kingdom.     The Germans under their new agreement with the Danish Government have agreed to pay higher prices hence-forth for all these commodities,The Danes apparelly have concluded an agreement with Austria under which they will receive light lubricating oils in return for Danish meat and butter.     The first consignment of oil (7,000 barrels) is expected to arrive early in 1918. The Swedes also are believed to have made arrangements for importing Austrian oil.* IMH3MAID8.        There is reason to believe that the Dutch Govern ment are now convinced of the need for a speedy and eomprehen-sive economic settlement with the Allies.   Mr. Van Vollenhoven has returned from Washington strongly in favour of agreement, and his views have been sympathetically received at the Hague. The Dutch assume that from our point of view tonnage is the first consideration, and, as a result of Mr. Van Vollenhoven&apos;s representations, they are prepared to hand over all the D utoh shipping which can be spared after Dutch requirements have
3473.been met in return for supplies of raw materials and food-stuffs.     The Dutch delegates in London have already sent to the Hague for fall particulars of normal pre-war imports into Holland from overseas to&apos;serve as a basis for calculating Holland^ requirements of tonnage.   Mr. Tan Tollenhpven thinkfe that in view of the general shortage of commodities Holland should be content with l&amp;fo of her normal supplies.   The import cf feeding stuffs would not be considered in connection with the tonnage question, but would be discussed in relation to the exports of Dutch produce to Germany.     In this connection the Dutch expect us to remember that the lilies are themselves drawing important supplies from Dutch sources;   but they pro-fess their willingness to work for a solution acceptable to the Allies.There is also a disposition at the Hague to discuss the Anglo-Dutch Shipping Agreement in a conciliatory spirit,,   The Dutch recently decided not to confirm this Agreement until a general agreement as to food supplies was reached with the United States,     The Netherlands Overseas Trust now intimate that they will put the Agreement into operation as soon as th  Americans allow bunkers to Dutch vessels proceeding to United States ports.go. SP^LN.      Notes confirming the new Anglo-Spanish Agreement have this week been exchanged between the two Governments, Under this Agreement we undertake to supply Spain with British coal carried in Spanish ships.   The Spanish Government in return undertake not to impede the export fromSpain of ores, metals or other minerals.   It is a disquieting fact that the Spanish Government, immediately affcer confirming the Agreement, pre-hibited all Spanish ships of over 5oo tons from proceeding
3484*abroad.     The order appears to conflict with the spirit aM purpose of the Agreement and Sir A. Hardinge is inquiring into the matter.jj6. SREEOB.      The Greek Government have appointed a Greek delegate to the Allied Board at Athens.     In saaking this appointment they explicitly accept the system of letters of assurance for Greek imports from the United States.I?. UNITED STATES.      The list of eneii^r firms compiled by the United States Authorities is comprehensive.   It contains 700 names which do not appear in any British, list.     On the other hand there are 550 names in the British Confidential Black list whl^h are not included in the United States List.   The United States have already asked us to withhold licences for any goods eon-signed to finns on their Black List in all casss where aueh goods would have to be transhipped in United States ports. As the American have thus directly asked us to cooperate in their measures against enemy trade we have suggested that an inter-Allied Committee might with advantage be i) rmed to secure uniformity between the various Allied lists.   It seems at any rate desirable that notes of the evidence on blaoklist-ed or suspect firms should be interchanged among the respective Governments.g8, SHIPPING.      The United States War Board, with the approval of our Embassy at Washington, have proposed that, pending a settle-ment of the Swedish and Dutch Shipping questions, Swedish ves-sels in British and United States ports and Dutch vessels in United States ports should be employed in carrying grain from South America and Australia to the United States.   There can be no reasonable objection to this proposal as it does not involve&apos;services in the danger zone.   If the proposal is not
accepted by the neutrals concerned the United States Governmentare prepared to requisition the Swedish and Dutch vessels inUnited States ports provided we support their action by requi-sitioning the Swedish vessels in British ports.The Germans have apparently agreed to deliver 22,000 tonsof shipbuilding steel to the Danish yards on condition that therevessels built will be/served exclusively for trade with Germany. Sir R. Paget will protest against the acceptance of siieh con-tracts.     She terms on which the Germans are delivering German material to the Dutch yards are equally onerous and have aroused some resentment in Holland.     $hey include a stipulation that ships built viith German steel shall be wilhheld from Allied services for three years after the war.    The importance of this question is now realised by the United States Shipping Authorities,   They are willing to licence American shipbuilding materials for export to neutral yards on the understanding that the ships at present building in Denmark, Horway and Holland will when completed be equally divided between the United States and the United Kingdom.The French Government have secured the services of the enemy ships in Brazil for trade between French and Brazilian ports.    We are enquiring at Paris whether these ships must be exclusively employed in such services.Negotiations for. the chartering of the enemy ships in China are no?/ concluded and have only to be ratified by the Allied Governments.     This tonnage will be divided equally between Japan, the United States and Great Britain.g9, MARK EXCHANGE.        The fise of the Mark exchanges in Scandinavia and Switzerland culminated on Dec7th and Dec.8th when the rates at Copenhagen aM Ohristiania stood at 56.60, the rate
6on Stockholm at -51.50, end the rate on Switzerland at 74.75 All three rates are new gradually declining.glO.
