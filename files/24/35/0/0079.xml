[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1917.CONFIDENTIAL.Sir C. Spring-Bice to Mr. Balfour.Washington, November 10, 1917.STEPHENSON KENT, who has been a tour round the country, drew up a report for the Secretary of War on the labour situation.   The upshot of it was that, from both on the capitalist and the labour side, the situation was bad and constituted the most serious danger to the prosecution of the war.   In his opinion this was the weak point, and a very weak point indeed.   Secretary Baker at once went to the President and communicated Kent&apos;s report.   When he came back he told Kent that the President was so much impressed with the situation that he would probably himself make a personal appeal to the labour representatives..   The imminent danger was that Gompers should lose control and be succeeded by someone less loyal to the Governm nt. The President accordingly went to Buffalo and made a very strong speech, indeed, in which he spoke more plainly than he has done for some time.   He declared that Germany was responsible for the war and that the war must be fought to a finish.   He said that for this good relations between capital and labour were essential.   Shortly afterwards the Secretary of War changed an order that had been given which looked like a diminution of the number of men on active service.   On the whole the recent disasters on the Italian front have not affected the Government or the people at large in a manner detrimental to the conduct of the war.   It may be said that the attitude of the press, while critical, shows a determination to proceed with the war with all the strength and resources of which this Government disposes.    It is true that some well-informed papers call attention to the very serious want of co-ordination.   They say that everything centres in the President and that nothing is done unless the President authorises it.   But they say that the President is but one man and one man&apos;s strength is not sufficient to deal with the situation.   Tl;ey call for the co-ordination of all the different departments under a really effective central control.    They say that little is being done in this direction.   In the very critical matter of  shipbuilding there is certainly a deplorable delay, and the deficit, in comparison with what was expected,  is very serious.     Congress has been lavish with   its money and  no complaint can be made on this score.   But it cannot be said that this country, with all its war enthusiasm and its spirit of devotion, is really organised as a war machine. Recent English comments, while they are pleasing and flattering to Americans here, do not meet with entire approval.   The tendency everywhere is to complain of lack of efficiency and lack of co-ordination.The Guvernment has made an arrangement with Japan which is likely to have very far-reaching results, and should be regarded as an event of first-class importance. Before the arrival of the Japanese mission here there was a very great reluctance to recognise the rights of Japan in Asia based upon self-defence and geography which the United States claimed for itself on this continent. Now Japan has received recognition as an Asiatic Power with-Asiatic rights and duties from an American Power with American rights and duties. This attitude of perfect and respectful equality should make a profound impression in Japan. There remains the vital fact that Japanese competition here will not be permitted by the labour organisations, and that no power in the world could persuade Americans to admit the unrestricted right of Japanese immigration. There will also always be a strong feeling of race antipathy, not. based upon racial prejudice&quot;, but on very solid grounds of fear for which there is abundant reason. The Caiifornians cannot stand up against Japanese competition nor are they in any position to defend themselves either economically or even physi-cally should the Japanese organise themselves in self-sufficing colonies. This is a fact which must not be lost&quot; sight of and which we should bring home, if possible, to the Japanese mind. The reason is not the inferiority of the Japanese but their superiority. This reason ought to satisfy Japanese amour-propre. It is to be hoped that it will be thoroughly understood.
Owing to the transference of all important negotiations to the other side there is very little to report here as to actual negotiations. The military and naval authorities are most friendly and are doing everything they can to show their friendliness. Bat I hope you will bear in mind that we must not take it for granted that, because they are friendly they are unlikely to resent any unwarranted interference, or what they may consider as such. They were very anxious to have expert military advisers, but^ they were not anxious to have officers whose rank and dignity would imply a position of command. What they wanted were young officers fresh from the scene of action who would be able to explain to the United States soldiers the technique of modern war. The French were most careful to meet this demand by sending young subordinate officers. Unfortunately we have sent men of superior rank which has hurt the feelings of the French and which has rather alarmed the Americans. I think this has been arranged, and T am very glad that you have given General Vignal the C.B., which has given the greatest satisfaction to him and to the French officers. Your military attache, General McLachlan, is a first rate appointment, and I cannot speak too highly of the way in which he is carrying out his duties, and of the confidence he inspires among Americans. The same of course can be said of General Trotter. I hope then-advice will be taken, because it would be a most serious thing if by any mischance we were to create the impression that we wanted to exercise control in the guise of advice. As I have often told you a number of Americans do not realise that George III is dead, and we have to bear in mind this peculiarity of the Americans.It is rumoured that the new Papal peace message is being considered at the Vatican. This excites great alarm among Catholics here. The New York election was a great victory for the Catholic party, and the Boston election was a great defeat. The reason was, or is supposed to be, that Mayor Mitchell, of New York, had attacked the Catholics and that they were acting in self-defence. At Boston the Cardinal entered the lists on behalf of Catholic education without any provocation from the other side. He retreated from his ground, but his party was entirely and even scandalously defeated. It is b-lieved that any party which on its own account raises a religious issue will be defeated. It is feared that a new Papal peace message will be taken up by a pariy in this country in opposition to the President^ policy and that the Catholic priests will follow the Papal lead and agitate against the war. If they do so the effect on the position and influence of the Catholic party here will be disastrous. The Papal delegate is entirely in the hands of the German Archbishop of Chicago, Munderlein. It is impossible to obtain access to him except through German channels. The American college in Pome represents the Extreme party, of which Munderlein is the representative her&apos;. There is good reason to believe that all the information about America which reaches the Vatican is very strongly coloured in the German-Irish and ulra montane sense, and is very strongly anti-Ally. It is believed that the Cardinal of Baltimore did not receive the message from the Pope before its publication and that a garbled account was given to the Pope of the opinions of the leaders of the Catholic clergy here. The situation is a serious one, and the State Department, which does not wish the religious issue to be raised, is anxious that some means should be taken of bringing the facts to the knowledge of the Pope. There are, however, great difficulties which may or may not be overcome. The object of Cardinal Gibbons is to obtain a position of power and influence by proving to the Vatican that he possesses the influence here (which he undoubtedly has) on all Moderate parties. He would like, of course, to induce the Government to accord some sort of informal representation at the Vatican and also, if possible, to adopt a friendly attitude towards Papal representation at the peace conference. According to present indications it would be very difficult indeed to alter the impression which generally prevads here that the Vatican&apos;s heart is with the Central Powers and that the Vaticans policy here is not that of the President. The other religious bodies, like the Episcopalians and the Presbyterians, are absolutely set on the prosecution of the war ana are determined in every way to support the President. They would absolutely refuse to send delegates to a conference such as is said to have been proposed by the Archbishop of Upsala, whose son is serving in the German army, and who has publicly justified the sinking of the &quot; Lusitania.&quot; It is recognised that the Lutheran Church here are with the German religious bodies and the majority of the Irish clergy in the Catholic Church the most dangerous political propagandists. A Swedish friend of yours is over here now, and, in concert with the&apos;United States authorities, is trying to stir up Scandinavian feeling in favour of the war. The Scandinavians are not hostile to the President; they are loyal, but they are very indifferent, and it is a matter of first rate importance that this great mass of hard-working and respected citizens should be gained over to entire allegiance to United
States policy. This is one of the reasons why the Government is reluctant, especially with the present Swedish Administration, to do anything to excite Swedish public opinion against the Allies. It is hoped that the rule of the Swedish Junker and Court party may be got rid of, and that a new administration will be formed supported on the Democratic party and favourable to the Americans and to the Allies. Mr. Hoover says that the Swedes are now obtaining food from Germany, and that he considers that the imminent necessity of supplies from this country has passed for the time. He regards the food position here as extremely serious. He told me last night that the United States has- already sent to Europe its normal export, and that everything that it sends in the future must be derived from savings from the normal consumption. An appeal will be made in this sense, and I notice that the German-inspired press is taking advantage of this fact to prosecute a covert propagandism against the war. A man in the best position to judge told me to-day, on the authority of a German friend, that 99 per cent, of the adult immigrants from Germany during the last twenty years were absolutely and fundamentally disloyal. For instance, they voted for the Socialist candidate at New York, not because they approved of Socialism, hut because he opposed the war. As an instance of what is being done, I may take two examples. From Texas we hear that the cotton is sent into the gins with some sort of chemical which causes a fire, and that the only gins certain to escape are those owned by Germans. Fires are of constant occurrence in all places where foodstuffs or supplies are stored. A high officer of the United States army told me to-day that at the barracks here it had been discovered that the needles used for the inoculation of the soldiers with anti-typhoid serum had been infected with tetanus. The discovery was made a -week ago. A priest whose sympathy for the Allies is known suffered from a mysterious ailment which the doctors were unable to deal with. Someone suggested that his Austrian servant should be sent away, and he immediately recovered. This is one of numerous instances. There is a very wide feeling of alarm and apprehension, and the Adminis-tration is unfortunately powerless, in view of the immense number of enemy aliens. I need not say what a danger this creates in the labour world. Like the Roman Empire, this country is divided not only by classes but also by races. The labouring element belong in the main to an alien race. Labour disputes are between races as well as between the rich and the poor. This offers immense advantages to anyone disposing of large sums of money which can be expended among foreign masses which have no sympathy with the policy of the governing race. Unfortunately, the employers are very often actuated, especially in the west, by the feeling of a slave-driver employing a foreign and hostile community. It is probable that the attitude of employers in many parts of the country would be such as to excite great surprise at home.Canada at one time appeared to desire special representation in the form of a High Commissioner at Washington. The State Department would be very glad to have a department thoroughly cognisant of Canadian affairs to deal with. It would welcome a special officer attached to the Embassy, with whom it could deal as to local questions affecting this continent. Of course the r- suit of such dealings will be submitted for the consideration of the highest authorities of the two Governments. The State Department is not at all anxious for such complications as would be caused by the separate representation of Great Britain and Canada here. When I was in Canada, 1 explained this to the Government, and also stated the details as to the difficulty of finding suitable accommodation in Washington at the present moment, and the very great expense which would result to the Dominion Government. I also pointed out that whenever important matters arose for discussion affecting Canada, the Canadian Government were in the-habit of sending down either Sir Joseph Pope, who was perfectly acquainted with American affairs, or the head of the department concerned. Mr. Lansing had expressed a strong desire to reciprocate such courtesies by himself going to Canada, and subsequently despatching high officials for the conduct of business. The natural result of propinquity and good relations is that the departments of the United States and the Canadian Government are dealing directly with each other, the Embassy merely serving as a central telephone station, to put its correspondents in communication with each other. Mr. Hoover, is carrying on all his business direct with very great success. The Police and intelligence Department correspond direct, and it is to be hoped that military affairs will also be managed by direct contract between high officials. The excellent relations of mutual friendliness and confidence which prevail between Ottawa and Washington and all alon^the border, enable the two Governments to carry on such business without mutual suspicion, and in a spirit of confidence. A High Commissioner would not facilitate the transaction of business
\unless he were to hand over allimportant matters to the representatives of the departments concerned, which he would be less likely to do than the British Embassy. Consequently I do not see that very much would be gained by such an appointment commensurate with the expenditure to say nothing of the graye international issues involved. At present, as there are important fishery negotiations impending, the Canadian Government is thinking of sending Mr. Hazen, late member of the Cabinet and now Chief Justice of Nova Scotia, with two expert advisers. The State Department wish to appoint two expert commissioners to consult with two expert commissioners to be sent by Canada. The State Department are careful to point out that the results of these discussions must be submitted to the two Governments for their appreciation. I am suggesting that if Mr. Redfield, the Minister of Commerce, were also appointed, he could usefully consider the wider issues involved in concert with Mr. Hazen, who is cognisant of the special views of the Canadian Government and can represent their wishes. Mr. Redfield is quite willing, but there are objections to. increasing the number of the commissioners without authority, or indeed, to widening the scope of the enquiry. Awkward questions may arise in Congress, which is very sensitive on the fishery question, which arouses intense local feeling. I hope, however, that the matter will shortly be arranged. The question of the more direct representation of Canada will thus he held over for a time, and I presume it will be raised at a later date in connection with the whole imperial question. Australia and New Zealand will of course demand separate organisations also, and if it is granted to Canada it could not be refused to them as they have very direct interests here, which equally require direct representation. The question is one mainly of convenience. If the present system i3 inconvenient to any sensible extent the self-governing colonies are sure to object. If arrangements can be made better than those prevailing at present for the transaction of business it would be perfectly possible to combine this with unity of diplomatic representation on all imperial questions. The lines on which an arrangement could be drawn up would be business lines, that is it would be necessary to define precisely the nature of the local interests affected and the best manner of dealing with questions arising in connection with them, These would not be entirely of a commercial nature. Some of a political character would also be local, as for instance, internal waterways and internal fisheries. But most fisher)7 questions would affect other nations like Japan or independent colonies like Newfoundland. It ought not to be impossible to draw up a formula which would be workable and which would ensure the separate and independent treatment of local questions without affecting the general unity of representation.With regard to military matters, as to which some difficulties have arisen, we have at present two Canadian officers who are serving with the two British military attaches. This arrangement works very well and ought to give satisfaction across the border. The appointment of Campbell Stewart, who is described officially as assistant military attache, but who has been from the beginning on Lord NorthclifrVs mission, attached to Lord Northcliffe, with whom he now is, raises rather a curious question. He does not. pretend to have any military knowledge, although graded as a colonel, but he has been prevented by ill-health from serving at the front. On the other hand, he is an expert propagandist, although he is not the s -rt of propagandist whom we wish to have here attached to the military mission. The Canadian army, after its splendid services, should not be represented in this country by a non-combatant officer. He is a very intelligent man, and will no doubt find useful occupation outside his military duties. He is supposed to have suggested to Lord Northcliffe his advocacy of the Canadian high-commis3ionership. Neither Lord Beading nor the Governor-General seem to have been aware of Lord NorthcUfhVs views on this subject, or of the conversations, if any, which he had with the Prime Minister. Sir Roberts object is to satisfy certain demands which are beginning to make themselves felt among&quot; the Canadians. Of course there was no idea of even the remotest beginnings of separation. As I said above, the question is one purely of practical convenience, and should be considered on those lines. It is hard to believe that the excellent relations now prevailing ou both sides of the border will be impaired. As long as they are what they are we need have no suspicion what-evcr of any ulterior design on the part of this Government.You will of course bear in mind that the great dangers to this country from the Atlantic centre in two points, the St. Lawrence and Mexico. Intrigues on the part of Germany in both these quarters are more than suspected, and the questions, although of course dissimilar, have a certain amount of resemblance, and are considered from the same point of view, namely, the defence of the United StatesYours sincerely,C.
