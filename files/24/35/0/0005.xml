Lord Milnerls Committee on Russian Supplieson the 5th inst., considered the application of the decision given on November 30th in War Cabinet 288 Minutes 9, 10, 11 and 12.It was decided to apply for a ruling on thefollowing points(a)     In Min. 9 (c) it was decided.that nIn regard to clothing, boots and other equipment of a non-warlike nature for Russia, the despatch of such articles shall be continued,&quot;The Treasury reading of this decision as announced by its representatives on the Committee is that :-(i) Only those articles answering to the above description which have already been delivered are to be despatched.(ii) completion of outstanding orders is to be suspended and(iii) no further orders can be placed unless a fresh credit is opened and a specific sanction obtained from the (Treasury.As this decision was taken by the War Cabinet as a measure of propaganda the Milner Committee con- , sider that.it is necessary to decide whether credits are to be given by the Treasury and- to wha&quot; extent.(b)      In connection with the above the decision taken at the Baris Conference and notified in Foreign Office telegram Nos. 1390 of Bee. 1st from Lord Beading and 1404 of Bee. 2nd from MroBalfour; in which it was stated respectively.(i) That it was hopeless to expect further supplies to reach Boumania through Northern Russia and(ii) That no further supplies should be sentto Russia for the present but that machine?^ for handling supplies should be kept in existence.The Mi ner Committee desire to know how far these decisions supersede those taken by the War Cabinet on Nov. 30th and whether all manufactur-ing for Russia is to be stopped and the plants transferred to other uses and perhaps broken up.
Under&quot;the contract for manufacturing rifles for the. Russian Government made with the Westinghouse Company of America in the name of Great Britain, the latter Government undertook to finance the cost of 1 million rifles at a cost of about  6 each.     Options were obtained to extend the order by lots of 400,000 and 200,000 rifles making a total of 1,600,000.     These opticns were exercised in September and November 1917 respectively.     The contract is in the name of the British Government but. an arrangement was made with, the American Government under which Great Britain provided credits for rifles delivered up to Dec. SLst 1917;   thereafter the American Government would open credits to the Russian Govern-ment which the latter undertook to hand over to the British Government in order to pay for deliver-ies of rifles.    Manufacture under these options has already commenced.     GSie present attitude of the American Government Treasury representatives is that.if Russia ceases to take part in the War as an Ally there i3 no legal power for the American Treasury to transfer credits to the British Govern-ment.The proposal of the Treasury representatives on the Milner CoDmittee is that the contracii should be wound up and in this the Committee agree. Approval is requested.Contracts exist in Canada and America on British credits for supply of railway rolling stock to Russia via vTadivostock.     There are at present in transit to that port; six ships carrying with other railway accessories, some 64 locomotives and 463 car3. while a further number are loaded in the port:of Vancouver, departure of the ship having freeh delayed owing to the situation existing in Russia during the past few weeks.     The Milner Committee desire a ruling as to whether railway rolling stock should be looked upon as warlike stores and therefore as coming within the terms of the War Cabinet*s prohibition.     In this connection it has to be remembered that(i) Some 60 or 70$ of the 640,000 tons of stores accumulated at Vladivostok can be classified as warlike and tho above rolling stock could be used for transport-ing them inland.(ii) While railway material and rolling stock shipped to Northern Russian x^orts might easily fall into enemy hands, the same: supplies supplied to Vladivostock might well prove of use to the more loyal sec-tion in Southern Russia and in Eoumania.With reference to War Cabinet 288 Min 11. One of the three ships referred to therein has arrived at Murmansk carrying approximately 2,000 tons of warlike stores out of a total of 3S400 tons cargo.
6.12.17The remaining two ships cannot be intercepted.     They carry approximately 1,220 and 1,720 tons of warlike stores out of total cargoes of 2,750 and 3,940 respectively.In all three eases the non-warlike Stores consist almost entirely of food, booth, clothing and agricultural machinery.The Jvlilner Committee are of opinion that these ships should be discharged of their non-warlike stores at Murmansk, the cargo of warlike stores being returned to BngLand.(f) Seven ships which were sent to Archangel haTe had to be moved from that port to Murmansk owing to the closing of the former port.     The ccmposi-tion of their cargoes is uncertain as they have been partially discharged.     The Milner Committee are of opinion that the same policy as recommended in (e) above should be followed.In the case of both (e) and (f) the Milner Committeeconsider that discretion should be given to the British NavalAuthorities at Murmansk to take whatever action they may considernecessary in the event of circumstances rendering compliance.vwiththe above recommendations impossibles(g) With regard to supplies for Roumania the American Government authorised the purchase in this country of stores of boots clothing-       etc., at a cost of 5 million dollars.     Arraiige-ments were made for purchase and the cost worked out at 7 million dollars..     This was duly noti-*fied to the Americans but no formal reply has been received.     They have however made it under-stood that, in view of the decisions in Foreign Office telegram referred to in (b) above., they will probably refuse to bear any of the cost. In this ovent should the cost be borne by Great Britain?    Most of the stores are now loaded on board Ship.Subject to rulings on the above points the Milner Committee suggest that in the absence of lord Milner their Vice Chairman Sir L. lorthington Evans should be empowered to decide any further details that may arise within the terms cf the WarVCabinet decision.
