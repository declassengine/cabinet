S 35 ORE T. G, T, 2940.PRO10P0SSD JANK   ARMIES,Memcrendum,,,. fey ^Sjr JS &amp;.H.JT ^d- ^nc.fU t*The Tanks having further proved their value in the recent operations at Ccmbrai, it appears that the whole question of the best possible way of using them requires full consideration.At Cambrai a complete victory was prevented from developing owing to the break through of the Tanks% not being followed up by the necessary forces backing up the attackaIt is therefore suggested that 3 special Tank armies should be formed^&quot; By the term Tank armies is not meant merely armies of Tanks but armies with Tanks as the primary offensive weapon, all other items * infantry, artillery, he., - being provided as necessary to help and follow up the Tank attackoIt is considered that 3 such armies would bo better and less unwieldy than one large force0Each arrnv should consist of 500 Tanks with the Tank personnel of about 6,000 or 7.000 men. other units of infantry  fee., bring the total of each army to about 100,000 men.The Tank armies should bo kept as small as possible consistently with their &quot;being a thoroughly effective striking force, so that they may be as mobile as possible with their own transport highly organized.   They could then be thrown quickly, and either together or singly, on any desired port of the front.Had an additional Tank army been available at Cambrai a really decisive victory would have been gained.To have 3 such armies, involving the prevision of 1,500 Tanks for tho 3, moans that the manufacture of double that number should be put in hand, It is therefore most important that we should &quot;collaborate as much as possible with the Americans, to whom the whole idea of Tanks appeals most strongly, and who are therefore ready to do all they can.First and last Tanks are a great economy; with a crowtof 8 or 9 end its armament of 6-poundors and machine guns. 1 Tank in attack is probably equal to. 400 infrntry, so that 500 Tanks may bo regarded as tho equivalent of something like 200,000 men ; thus aTank
Tank army of only 100,000 men is equal to an ordinary army of nearly 500,000, and 3 Tank armies equal to nearly 900,000 men without Tanks; but they only require the supplies of a third of that number.   Our new Tanks will be much faster and more efficient than those used at Cambrai , and the above figures can therefore be taken as not overestimated .Indirectly the economy ill men goes still further. For clearing wire and annulling the value of the enemy defences, the Tanks at Cambrai did the work which would have had to be done by several hundred-thousand tons of shell; so that an Immense amount of steel, T.H.T., &amp;c., was saved and also all the labour of manufacturing it, and the ships and rolling-stock to transport it; and the cost.I am still of opinion that the original method of attack which I suggested would be the best; it would still constitute a surprise and the separate Tank armies proposed would suit the tactics necessary.We have the initiative with Tanks at present: if we fail to take full advantage of it at once , the enemy will get Tanks in large numbers and we shall lose this great advantage .Having gone very fully into the whole matter from the very commencement and having necessarily thought of the tactics as well as the designs of Tanks, I submit the above remarks which may possibly be&apos; of use or at any rate of interest to the War Cabinet .(Sd.)    E.H.T., d&apos;Eyncourt.10th December, 1917.
