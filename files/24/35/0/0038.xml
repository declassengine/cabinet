AI &quot;7CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS EMPLOYED IN THE POST OFFICE.       / jtfgMemorandum of the 21st ultimo by theJj^ii       Postmaster General:    G.T.2708.1.     I have obtained from the Central Tribunal particulars of the cases of three conscientious objectors employed in the post Office which have been dealt with by them.     The informa-tion may be of assistance to the V/ar Cabinet in considering the question raised by the Postmaster General,In the first case, the man was a cable telegraph operator in the Foreign Cable Department of the Central Telegraph Office,     The Central Tribunal gave him exemption on condition that he undertook work: of national importance under the Pelham Committee,     The General Post Office stated that the man was not indispensable, but that they thought that he would be likely to render more useful service in his then occupation than in any other;   that the staff was depleted and that they would be glad to retain him if this was approved.     The Central Tribunal were prepared to allow him to remain as a telegraph operator pro-vided that he was removed some distance from London and that he made..a substantial pecuniary sacrifice.     The General Post Office replied that they could arrange for his transfer to Salisbury and that hie pay would be reduced from 40s, to 32s. a week;   and the Central Tribunal approved of this arrangement.Later, the General post Office wrote that the position of conscientious objectors had been reconsidered, that they still considered that it was desirable that conscientious objectors in the Post Office who had been exempted conditionally on taking up work of national importance should remain in Post Office employment, but that they could be retained only on their normal duties at the office to which they are normally attached:   it v/as suggested that, to meet the condition of pecuniary sacrifice, a condition might be imposed that the man be reauired to contribute to some charitable institution.     The Central Tribunal were not prepared to agree to the course proposed, and thought that any discrimination in favour of Government employees would be open to serious criticism.     The man was required to take up other work with private employers.     It may be mentioned that subsequently he had to be discharged from one post because other employees threatened to strike.In the second case, the man was a chief clerk in the Telephone District Office of a provincial town.     In this case also the Central Tribunal granted exemption on condition that the man took work of national Importance under the Pelham Committee. The General Post Office stated that the man was not indispensa-ble, but was likely to render more useful service in his present occupation than in any other.     In view of the decision of the Postmaster General mentioned above, that men who were retained must be kept at their normal duties and at their Uoual offices, the Central Tribunal required the man to take up other employment.In the third case the man was a sorting clerk and telegraphist at a provincial post office.     In this case also the General Post Office wrote that the man was not indispensable, but that they would be glad to retain him if allowed.     The Central Tribunal required this man also to take up other work. Ab in the first case mentioned above, this man had subsequently to be discharged from one post because other employees thrtatened to strike.It will be seen from these three cases that the Central
Tribunal have considered that the men who are exempted from military service on the ground of conscience should be re-quired to undergo ?ome sacrifice (not as a punishment, but Unfairness to other men who have to serve and have to under-go very much more severe sacrifices).r2,     I may add, that some time ago my attention was called by the Postmaster General to a case decided by the London Appeal Tribunal, in which the Tribunal had given exemption,on the ground of conscience, to a man employed at the General Post Office, the exemption being subject to the condition that the man waa not to receive more than the Army rate of pay.     The difficulties were pointed out - that, if? he had in fact become a soldier in the ordinary way, he wduld continue to be paid his salary;   and that Trade Union difficulties might arise if he were retained at hio civilian post and paid less than the current rate of remuneration. The Appeal Tribunal then varied their decision, and required the man to contribute to charitable purposes the amount by which his remuneration exceeded the pay and allowances of a soldier.The man has complied with this requirement up to the present time, and in at least one other case the Appeal Tribunal have given a similar decision in respect of a Post Office employee.W.
