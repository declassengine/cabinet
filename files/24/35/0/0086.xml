(1)12th Decembe1917.Sir,I beg to submit the following Report on the work of thePood Production Department for the week ended 11th DecemberThe Weather.Over the greater part of England the weather last week was open, and good progress was made generally with farm worki    In some parts, however, notably Shropshire and Staffordshire, the conditions were very unfavourable, heavy snow storms in the earlier part of the week having left the ground very wet and sodden, while in the Eastern and Northern counties frost held up ploughing for some days.     In Wales also there was some snow as well as keen frost in the hilly districts.Cambridgeshire, .  The Committee, having failed by various kinds of persuasion followed by orders to get the occupier of a 387-acre . farm at Fest v/ickham to improve his cultivation, have now been authorised to take possession and to cultivate the farm themselves under the management of a neighbouring farmer.Gloucestershire.     The Committee, who had been authorised to take possession of a farm of 142 acres near Chipping Campden, which had been notoriously neglected by the owner-occupier, have now induced him to let -the farm for five years to an adjoining farmer.LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION.Agricultural Executive Committees.
Offences against the Regulations.   In Lindsey Mr. Chatter-ton of Somerby Hall, Grimsby, has been fined  100 and  25 costs for con-travening an order of the Committee allowing him to grow mustard on 20 acres of clay land only upon condition that the crops should be eaten off or ploughed in as green manure.     The defence was that the mustard had been already sown when the conditional permit was served.     In..Somerset Colonel Sandford has been fined  15 and  5 5s. costs for non-compliance with an order to cultivate two acres of land that were covered with couch.     In Leicestershire a farmer at Ashby Magna was fined  5 and  5. 5s. costs for not complying with an order to break up 12j acres on a farm of 113 acres, of which before the order only 25i acres was arable.Drainage.   In Cheshire considerable progress has been made with the work of cleansing the Birkett and its tributaries, and nearly 4,000 acres will be improved as a result.     Serious damage having been caused by recent gales to the Wallasey Sea Wall in this neighbourhood, the Cheshire Committee have lent some of the prisoners of war employed on the Birkett to the Embankment Com-missioners for the urgent work of repairing the wall.   In Norfolk $he work of cleansing the River Tud has been started.   In Cumberland the Committee have caused 35 water-courses to be cleansed wholly or in part, by giving notices to the occupiers under Para.(h) of Regulation 2M, and in only a few cases have they had to do the work themselves.     In Surrey notices have been given requiring the cleansing of one of the head waters of the Fandle. Damage by Game.     Action under the Pheasants Order Is reported from Norfolk and under the Rabbits grder from Surrey and the North Riding. Pigeon shoots are being organised by the Derbyshire Executive Committee.Determination of Tenancies.   During the week 3 Orders have been made authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of bad farm-ing in respect of 426 acres, and 10 Orders have been made by the Board determining the tenancies of 496 acres.
HORTICULTURAL DIVISION.Home Canner, The number of Home Canners sold-during.-the-past 6 months is 150 and the number of cans (2 lb., 3 lb. etc) 200^00^ Work continues to be carried on at the small canning stations at * Bridgwater, Cheltenham and Worcester, and during the past week 5,000 cans of fruit have been prepared at Bridgwater, 4.800 at Cheltenham.Spraying. A pamphlet, containing the report of last season!s spraying operations and giving general Instructions with respect to spraying, has been prepared and will be published shortly. Fruit Preserving.   The staff of the Fruit Preserving Section under Mr.C.S.Mart in, was transferred to the Ministry of Food at the end of last week.TECHNICAL DIVISION.Inspection of Land.   The three holdings on the Southwood and Old Parks Estate (9t0 acres) of Sir Vauncey Crewe have been inspected, in connection with a scheme submitted by the Leicestershire Executive Committee for the taking over of the holdings on account of their badly farmed condition.     The land was found to be in an utterly neglected condition, some of it being practically derelict. The smallest possible amount cf labour seems to have been expended, and much of the hay ,was either uncut or not carted, and left to rot in the fields.     The hedges, ditches and drains are in iurgent need of attention.     The Executive Committee have been authorised to take over the largest of the three farms (550 acres), unless the landlord will accept authority to determine the tenancy and will, put in a new tenant.     Detailed suggestions for the working of this farm have been made.     As regards the other two farms, it is not considered that the return in food during the next two or three years would justify the Committee taking them over.     It has, therefore, been suggested that the
tenants should be required to manure the fields which are to be mown for hay next year in accordance with the instructions of the Committee, and the Committee has been authorised to take possession of selected fields on each of the two farms next spring, with a view to their being broken up, and summer fallowed or sown with wheat or beans in early autumn.Food Value of the Potato.    In view of the extent to which potatoes are likely to be necessary for supplementing cereals next season, further information as to their precise food value is wanted.     Arrangements have, therefore, been made for the analysis of a number of the chief varieties now on the market.     Most of the potato analyses available are old and not reliable. Seed Testing Station.   The number of samples sent to the Station during the week is 143, making a total of 570 received up-to-date. The seed vrtieat tested has been of very varying quality, the germination ranging from 20% to 100$..     Inferior samples of vetches are also being received, and the indications are that both current and yearling English red clovers are of very poor germination.LABOUR DIVISION.*Soldier Labour. A return forwarded by the Departments District Commissioners on Saturday last shews tha&apos;; up to that date 970 ploughmen had arrived from overseas on two months&apos; agricultural leave.     Of these men, 92 have been sent out in charge of Government horses, and 536 to farmers for ploughing work only, subject to immediate withdrawal when required for the horse scheme. Arrangements are being made for the remainder of the men to be got out at once.Excluding the men above mentioned, the number of soldiers made available to date for the 1918 programme, out of the 43,000 men allocated to agriculture, is 28,944, of whom 17,677 are so-called &quot;skilled&quot; and 11,267 unskilled.    Of these men, 15,477 &quot;skilled&quot;, and 8,236 unskilled are out on farms.
Additional men to the number of 89 were supplied for training as Tractor Drivers during the week, making a total of 1,652 men.Horses,    Orders for the issue of 306, horses were, sent out during the week, making a total of 4,218 horses to date.Some Agricultural Executive Committees are experiencing difficulty in obtaining supplies of corn and hay for the Departments horses, and in other cases are compelled to pay exhorbitant prices.     The war Office have, therefore, been asked to assist the Department by allowing them to draw rations for their horses from Army Service Corps Depots.     Such a concession will-be of very great assistance to this Department, and will also result in a considerable saving of public money. Prisoners of War.   Schemes for the employment of four additional batches of prisoners were sent to the War Office during the week, making a total of 21 new schemes now under..consideration, involving, together with the additional men required for the existing camps, the employment in agriculture of an additional 1,718 prisoners.During the week, 120 prisoners have been added to certain of the existing camps, bringing the total of combatant prisoners employed up to 4,515.     In addition, 1,359 interned aliens are being employed on agricultural work, making the total number of prisoners now employed in agriculture 5,874.Women&apos;s Branch, Miss Talbot, O.B.E., the Director of the Women&apos;s Branch, was, received in audience by the Queen on the 7th inst. Her -Majesty expressed a very great interest in the employment of ?/omen in the work of food production, and wished it to be known that she is much interested in the women land workers and greatly impressed by the valuable work in which they are now engaged.
The demand for women in afforestation continues, and a second Glass for the training of forewomen Is being arranged.     The students at the Cheshire Training Centre for motor tractor driving will finish their course this week, and have been given employment on the staff of the Tractor Representative for that County.     Those at Chequers Farm, whose training will shortly be completed,.are to work under the Tractor Representative in Kent.     Requests have been received this week for rabbit trappers and trainings are being arranged as required.There are 6,993 women accounted for this week as members of the Land Army as followsIn Training Centres............... 271On Farm Work .............v......... 5,869Employed by the Forage Department.. 376Employed by the Timber Supply Dept. 187Waiting for employment in Depots... 63 Waiting for references to be placedin Training-- Centres............ 31Waiting in their own homes ........ 1966,993MECHANICAL CULTIVATION DIVISION.The following statement shows the position as regardsthe provision of Tractors owned by &quot;the Department:-Consigned to agricultural Executive Committees up to and includingDecember 4th...............     1,772Consigning instructions givenduring the week.............. 38On offer to Counties    ............. 80Consigned to Scotland 12711    &apos;      &quot; Ireland    82........        209&apos;  2,099The weekly reports from Tractor Representatives show that steady improvement is taking place in the efficiency of drivers and ploughmen employed on the Government tractors.     Increases in total acreage ploughed and individual results worthy of special comment are now a regular feature of the returns.     The &quot;following are extracted from recent reports which have given rise to the above conclusion:-
In Cambridge the acreage ploughed by 18 tractors for the week ending 23rd November - 274-j? acres - 15.2 acres average.     In Derby 12 tractors during the week ending 30th November ploughed 136 acres;   a great improvement on the previous week when 93i acres were ploughed.     Two of the Tractors* Titans, have ploughed 18j and 20J respectively in wet land.     In Lincoln during the week ending 30th November 25 tractors ploughed and cultivated an average of 15^ acres per tractor.     The best performance was that of a Titan which ploughed 26 acres in 60 hours.During the week ending 23rd November the Bourton on the Water unit in Gloucester ploughed an average of 20 acres per tractor (working consumption 3^ gallons of paraffin per acre-).    One of these tractors ploughed 24 acres in 60 hours.SUPPLIES DIVISION. Sulphate of Ammonia.     All the sulphate of ammonia which is likely to be produced up to the end of May next has now been sold by makers for forward delivery either to farmers or merchants with the exception of small quantities v/hich are reserved for local delivery from Gas Works *     The Distribution Committee is not now in a position to accept orders for any substantial quantities.     There are, however, large quantities in the hands of dealers and merchants, which are available for sale to farmers. &apos;The deliveries for agricultural use during November amounted to 16,000 tons as against 13,500 tons in the preceding month.^BE2S2]l?l ^i^&apos;     Tlie Distribution Committee has arranged for considerable quantities of superphosphate to be moved from the works to local stores in different parts of the country whence it can be delivered to farmers in the Spring.
Basic Slag. An endeavour is &quot;being made in conjunction with the Ministry of Munitions to clear the stocks of basic slag at several works in the Middlesborough area by running special trains to Liverpool and also to the South of England for local distribution. Railway difficulties, however, in the Middlesborough area are very acute, and it has not yet been possible to give effect to the pro-posed arrangement.It is hoped to commence grinding low grade slag at the Cement Works at Cambridge and Denbigh early in January. Potash.   An arrangement has been made with the Flax Control Board whereby Potash produced from Flue Dust at the Government Factory up to the end of March next will be handed over to the Irish Depart-ment of Agriculture for use on the Flax crop only.   The Factory is not likely, however, to be producing until the middle of January at the earliest, and the total amount which it will be possible to supply to Ireland in this way will be limited.    In order to supple-ment it, it has been agreed with the Potash Production Department that high grade Flue Dust containing more than 12% of Potash should as far as possible be diverted to IrelandcSeveral additional firms have now been authorised to purchase flue dust from blast furnace owners and to sell it to Approved Agents.   It is proposed to licence a limited number of firms for this purpose, provided they possess the necessary facilities for testing and grading flue dust.   The attention of the Collecting Agents has been drawn to the importance of having the flue dust properly tested and sold in accordance with the Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act.   Steps are being ,taken to ensure that the flue dust is free from injurious matter which would be harmful to orops.   Instructions as to a suitable test are being prepared by Dr. Russell In.conjunction with the Government Laboratory.
