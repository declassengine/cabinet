/Stores/7683.*7 a R    .6 A g IH 3 T,,Memorandum, by the Secretary of State for War, The proposed use of the R.T.S, bullet against airoraft in prance,,.Sir Douglas Haig has recently reported that the bullet which the Germans are using against Kite Balloons is much superior for that purpose to those supplied to the Royal Flying Corps, and he strongly recommends that the decision of the War Committee prohibiting the use of explosive bullets in France against enemy aircraft should be rescinded.In November 1915 the War Committee (55th Meeting), in response to an enquiry from the War Office whether the Buckingham or other incendiary bullet intended to be used either as a 1 tracer1 or to set fire to airships might be issued to British aviators, authorised the Admiralty and the War Office to employ incendiary; and explosive bullets against aircraft.   By a decision of the War Committee at their 56th Meeting on the 20th July 1916, the Pomeroy explosive bullet was limited to use ^within this country and against Zeppelins..-&apos;&apos;   This decision has been interpreted to debar the use of explosive /bullets against airoraft abroad.   At present, therefore, the use in France of tracer or other incendiary - bullets is permissible., but explosive bullets are barred.There is no effective bullet available in France for attacking airships and kite balloons,and the Royal Flying Corps wish to employ for this purpose in all theatres of war a new bullet called the R.T.S.., or any similar ammunition whose principal characteristic is not its explosive .effectsThe. oase against their use would be:*- (a) the capture of samples of such ammunition . would enable, the enemy to oopy it and so obtain a more effeotive bullet, than he has at present; and (b) the Gerraans might say that It was- contrary to International Law and threaten reprisals   against, ef fleers or men captured with spell ammunition in their possession.As regards (a.) Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s letter shows that, the Germans already possess an effective bullet for attacking kite balloons..As regards (b) a sample of the German bullet used against British Kite Balloons has been obtained from France, and proves on examination to be the same explosive bullet as that found on the first Zeppelins brought dorm in this country.   This bullet is Constructed-to explode on time, and not, as in the case of the  -Pomeroy, to jjxplode on impact.   . The Germans have justified its tmployment on the ground that it is used for signalling purposes like tracer, bullets,It is therefore legitimate by way of retaliation to use a similar bullet, and British aviators could not be punished if captured with such bullets in. their possession without the risk that enemy airmen who have been captured with similar ammunition in their possession would be subjected to the same treatment.&apos; Oonsiderable delay, however, \?ould be involved in the design and supply of a bullet similar to the German bullet; this would be avoided if the use of the R.T.S. bullet were sanctioned.The
The R.T.S.- is&quot; an irioendiary &quot;bullet which contains a small quantity of explosive matter designed only to open the bullet and release the incendiary material.   9hile, therefore, it is nominally explosive, it is really incendiary both in intention and effect.   The employment of Tracer incendiary ammunition against aircraft is recognised by the belligerents as legitimate.&apos;As regards the legal aspect, the use both of incendiary and of explosive bullets is forbidden by the St, Petersburg Declaration of 1868, the principles of which are embodied in the&apos; Hague Convention of 1907.   The aim of those who framed the St. Petersburg Declaration was to reooncile the necessities of war with the diotates of humanity,- and it was agreed that new problems oaused by scientifie development in the armament of troops would have to be considered on these lines.   The employment of air ship e and kite balloons raises just such a problem as was Contemplated,/- and no objections merely on technical grounds can be maintained to means of effeoting their destruction which do not also offend against the spirit of the St, Peterehrq^g Declaration.Accordingly the use of the R,T.S. bullet for this purpose can be justified,     Moreover the argument advanced by the Germans in support of their use of an explosive - signalling bullet applies equally well to the R.T.S, bullet.To summarize:The use of incendiary bullets against aircraft has already been sanctioned.The R.T.S, bullet, although open to objection on the ground that it contains explosive matter, is essentially an incendiary bullet.The Germans themselves use an explosive bullet against aircraft which they justify on the ground that its primary use is for signalling purposes.   They would therefore be unable to maintain an objection to R.T.S. ammunition merely on the ground that it contains axplosive matter,In these circumstances I trust the T7ar Cabinet will sanction the use of the R.T.S. bullet against airoraft in Prance.(Sgd,) Derby.
