SUMMARY OP WORK CARRIED OUT BY THE ROYAL FLYING CORPS DURING THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER.During the month of November the weather waa still more unfavourable for flying than during the month of October.In October, the number of hours flown by the squadrons in the Field was 30,.604j in November, a total of 17^716 hours were flown.The weather when important operations were taking place on the ground, was peculiarly unfortunate from the flying point of view, and the conditions would have been considered quite impossible a few months ago.Nevertheless, flying was carried out on these days at so low a height and in spite of such adverse conditions of mist and cloud that our conception of what an aeroplane can do has been enlarged..It is this low flying in the.mist and beneath low. clouds that undoubtedly constitutes the main feature of the month&apos;s work.        It enabled the Corps machines to co-operate with the Infantry and with the Tanks, and the scouts to attack the enemy*s infantry, transport, cavalry and guns with bombs and machine gun fire .During, the month, on six days the weather was too bad to allow of any flying.During the month 40 hostile machines were brought down in fights in the air, and claimed in tho official communique. 37 were claimed as having been driven down out of controlj the Brigades claiming to have destroyed 84 and to have driven down 73 out of control.Besides these, 8 hostile machines were brought down by anti-aircraft gun fire, machine guns and the infantry.   These also were claimed in the official communique.71 of our machines are missing, and these losses are
due rather to the weather than to the enemy1 s activity.     The losses were also due to the nature of the flying which as pointed out above, was principally carried out at extremely law heights.     If an engine Is hit in these circumstances it is nat-urally impossible for the machine to get back as it has not suf-ficient height to enable it to glide across the lines,     On two days alone we lost a total of 22 machines, and there is little doubt that nearly all these were lost owing to weather.Of our losses 62 were fighting machines engaged on reconnaissance, offensive patrols and ground work, five of the remainder were out on bomb raids, three ?/ere engaged on artillery work and one on photography.74 bomb raids were carried out and a total of 2742 bombs - equalling 55i tons - were dropped.The enemy:s bombing aircraft were less active than has been the case hitherto.     Only 389 bombs were reported to have been dropped by hostile machines,With regard to other branches of work in the air :-1459 hostile batteries were engaged for destruction, of which 450 were successfully disposed of.314 other targets were engaged for effect.252 other targets were ranged on. 5000 photographs were taken. 4252 offensive patrols were carried out. 1169 artillery     &quot;129 contact        &quot;204 night flights663 special missions 177,000 rounds were fired at&quot;ground targets,At 00H3Y, in the Southern area, the weather was .still
worse than in the West, and during the month only erne bomb raid was carried out by 12 machines of 110.55 Squadron against the works at KAISERSLAUTERN, a distance of 100 miles from the aerodrome-.     Three 230 lb. bombs and six 112 lb, bombs&quot; were dropped from a height of 15,000 feet.     The results were not observed owing to the clouds in which there were only a few gaps.     One hostile machine was shot to pieces during the oper-ation.     All our machines returned safely.The character of the low flying which took place during operations will be best appreciated by reading some of the pilots&apos;&apos; reports - here are some of them :-Xjleirbg^ylg^Vg No,68 Squadron, A-.F.C,    While engag-ing the enemy1s troops in the trenches from 30 feet he had his machine badly damaged by machine gun fire and was forced to land, in No Man&apos;s Land.     He crawled out of his machine which had lost both its planes and was fired at by German snipers. He took up a German rifle and fired back and eventually made his way to an advanced British patrol where he assisted in bringing back wounded men.     He then found another machine be-longing to his squadron.     The pilot of this machine had been out bombing and had been wounded and forced to land,     Lt. Taylor attempted to start this machine but without success as the petrol tank was shot through.     He ultimately got home in a staff car3Captain Lee, No. 46 Squadron dropped 4 bombs into B0URL0N WOOD.     The bursts were difficult to observe owing to shell fire, but he believes two of them hit the objective.     He then fired at the German infantry in FONTAINE Village.   While re-tiring temporarily to correct - jambs in his guns a shell burst underneath him and brought the machine down so close to the Ger-man lines that he had to run 100 yards under German machine gun fire and was consequently unable to destroy his machine.     While
walking back to CANTAING with a guide a shell burst in a house&apos; he was passing and blew him across the road.    On his way back he assisted the wounded and stretcher bearers to bring in the wounded.The following report constitutes a record with regard to the number of German machines brought down in one day by one machine:-C-apt * ft ^EcMoEeever- ,, M -    , pilot, and 2/Lt ohoA * Powell, MoCo, observer. No,. 13. -Squadron.       When flying in a northern direction 9 enemy aircraft suddenly appeared out of the mist on our right side: I made a sharp turn East to get under them and I engaged one hostile machine at 15 yards firing about ten rounds.   A minute later the E.Ae machine burst into flames on the ground.As I turned to get back to our linos five enemy aircraft dived on my tail all firing, my observer fired at one hostile machine at a 20 yard range and this ma&amp;hine fell and crashed on the ground.     He engaged two other enemy machines with indecisive resultscI then engaged another enemy machine which had over-shot us and fired 25 rounds at 25 yards range; the enemy mach-in&amp; fluttered down and crashed on the ground.    I also engaged two hostile machines with indecisive results; my observer&apos;.s gun had a stoppage, and I fought these two machines to within 20 feet of the ground,     When at 100 feet from the ground, the two German&quot;! machines were still firing,, so I dived and, evidently thinking they had got us, they commenced to climb again,, and we got back over the lines about 20 feet up.4:12:17.
