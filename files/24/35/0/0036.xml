There are a large proportion of officers, military and naval, whose services might also be made available,   $he telegram from Sir Cunningham Greene about Admiral Koltchak indicates where a Commander might perhaps be found. Even if this force only amounted to 3 or 4,000 men, it would not be without value and might in oertain circumstances play an extremely important part. It should certainly not be dissipated in battles in France, but carefully preserved as a disciplined instrument for use in Russia should an opportunity occur.*-(flgd.)    WIKSTQK 3.
