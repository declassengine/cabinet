VISIT OP THL ICINS Off BS^DEKi -TO CHBISTIMIA.The fact that the Swedish King should visit his former dominion is an event of some significance.     Previous to the separation in 1905 the feeling between the two peoples was very hitter and H.M. visit was pertly, no doubt, to show the Norwegians that the hatchet had been buried as far as he was concerned.     They responded by giving him a cordial reception -a far more spontaneous one in fact than during any visit while he was Crown -Prince of Sweden.     Since the outbreak of hostili-ties, h.M. has consistently emphasised the importance of Scan-dinavian solidarity.     At the banquet given in his honour, King Gustaf said: &quot;j3ach of our three nations is small in itself, but together we constitute a force which must be reckoned with when it is a question of the safeguarding end maintenance ox our independence and our right freely to dispose of our des-tinies1&apos;.     The speeches of the other sovereigns present were in a similar sense.     -according to the best available iniorma-tion the result of the meeting at Christiania.has been:1.     That there was no question of an action in favour of Peace.2.     That the questions of Finland and the Aland Islands were not alluded to.3.     That the re-establishment of International Law was con-sidered.     It was decided to establish Committees in each of the Scandinavian States to consider separately what points of International Law these should eventually advocate.   -4.     It was decided that each Scandinavian State should deal separately with its own food problems.
5. That exchange of goods should so far as possible &quot;be en-couraged between the three States.6.     The best means of dealing with espionage.A reliable source reports that the Norwegian Prime Minister considers that he has done good work in strengthening the hands of the present liberal-Socialist Government in Sweden, and that he regards &quot;Activism&quot; in that country as dead.     It may be that this opinion is over sanguine.     It seems almost incredible that in view of the strong pro-German sympathies of the Swedish court and bureaucracy and Army, that activism can be anything more than dormant, especially having regard to the German successes in the Baltic, the chaos in Russia and Finland end the forlorn condition of the Alands so long coveted by Swedish Chauvinists.     A usually reliable source reports a continual inflow of guns from Germany, a storing up of muni-tions and other signs oi military activity.     This may of course be no more than a cautious desire to prepare for all possible eventualities at a time when the very foundations of civilisa-tion appear to be crumbling;   but there is certainly a tendency to over-ionfidence in Mr. Kundsen&apos;s view.     It should not be forgotten that the Swedish people has a long and hungry winter before it, that the liberal Socialist coalition may not hold together for long and some anti-entente politician may regain power.     Under the influence of a revival of the activist move-ment such a statesman might yield to the temptation to occupy Finland and the Alands, consoling the Sv/edish people by des-cribing his action as the &quot;realisation of Sweden&apos;s historic mission&quot;, or some such phrase, thus reconciling them to a policy their better judgment would have condemned in less troublous times.It appears certain that at the Christiania Conference it was agreed that it should not be regarded as unneutral or
incompatible with Scandinavian co-operation if one of the three countries stopped exports to one oi the belligerent parties. This is important, as it suggests thct Denmark and Sweden would not have agreed unless they were practically sure thft Germany would not attack Nonsay if that country stopped exportation to the Central Powers.     It is said, also on good authority, that the German Representative at Christiania has definitely told the Norwegian Minister of foreign -affairs that a stoppage of exports would be considered unneutral by his Government.PUBLICATION BY THE BOLSHEVIK GQVERIEwNT Oi&quot; THE SECRET TEI^GRAMS BETWEEN THE IATE RUSSIAN BggLd AHi) jfaSBOa. (W3ffl&amp;MS:This action has caused a good deal of oomment in Sweden, especially in Socialist&apos; circles where the Imperialistic aims of Russia, apparently countenanced by the French Government, have not produced a favourable impression.     The pro-German Press has, needless to say, made the most oi their opportunity, two points in the correspondence being specially selected for adverse criticism:1.     A telegram from the Russian foreign Office to the Russian Ambassador in Paris stating interalia that they consider that they must secure French support for the removal, on the conclusion of the war, of the limit imposed in 1856 to their power in the Aland Islands.2.    A tolegram from the Russian Ambassador at Paris to his Government stating that the French Government are prepared to recognise Russia!s unrestricted rights in the matter of her Western frontier.    The Swedish newspapers point out that while the Russian Government was giving assurances to Sweden that after the war they intended to dismantle the fortifications erected on the Aland Islands, they were endeavouring to obtain from Prance their release from the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Paris of 1856.
The first point is not easy to explain in a manner satisfactory to Swedish sentiment;   hut it is clear that by &quot;Western frontier&quot; the Russian Government meant the frontier towards Germany and Austria-Hungary.
