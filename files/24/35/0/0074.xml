SECRETDepartment of Information GHW/004WEEKLY   REPORT   ON . HOLLAND.    IV, (Dec 13th, 1917)jhtSand and gravel Question.- The only advance which appears to have been made in this matter is the publication nt the Dutch White Book dealing with the correspondence which has passed between the Netherlands, British and German Governments.     Several of the Dutch newspapers have by no means adopted the views of the Netherlands Government that the rruge-Tjuantit^es of sand and gravel sent to Belgium were exclusively destined for non-military work.     Especially interesting are the oomments of the &quot;Schippersblad&quot; (Oct. 27-) which represents the Dutch barge industry and is therefore in a poaition to know the opinion of those actually employed in transporting the materials in question over the w&amp;terways of Holland as to their ultimate destina. tion.     When the suspicions of the authorities were at last aroused owing to the immense and steadily increasing transports no one was, it would seem, more amused than the bargemen who all along had been perfectly aware of the unneutral proceedings of the Government. As the newspaper observeo &quot;Many earned a good penny in that way without venturing to maintain that such Seals could be strictly called neutral&quot;.     The correspondence in the White Book certainly proves that the Netherlands Authorities shewed a good deal   of GOmplaiHanoe to the Germans.     For instance on July 3. 17 Baron Govers, the Dutch Minister at Berlin, announced that the transport would stop on August 1;   but with one short interval it wa3 allowed to continue till Nov. 15;    the fact being that all neutral nations
301are of opinion that it is much safer to set the British Government at nought than risk the vengeance of the Germans.     The idea that the German Government Was filled with eagerness to construct cr repair Belgian roads at a moment when no Belgian oould walk without permission from his own villrge to another is so absurd that it is difficult to believe that the Butch Government can really have been deceived by so specious an argument.     Still the need for xesd material - in colossal quantities - for non-military use in Belgium has all along been the pretext for the transport over Butch waterways df these materials.     It would appear that the Dutch Government has now demanded facilities for a fresh investigation by experts within the military gone .     Whether this will simply prove a solemn farce as before remains to be seen.Internal Affairs.Next year the elections take place in Holland and already there are not wanting signs that the party truce is being less literally regarded.     It is hardly too much to say that the question of the food supply has driven all others into the background.     The food policy of the Government has covered the whole country with a net-work of Committees and Bureaux which control nearly all branches of business.     Mr, Posthuma, the Minister of Agriculture. Industry and Commerce, stands at the head of the whole system of distribu-tion and is staunchly supported by the Socialists.      Mr. Treub, the Minister of Finance, who is a trained economist, has realised that the State cannot continueindefinitely to provide at a loss food and other necessaries for the poor and he has therefore proposed to limit the supply to the lower classes, leaving the prosperous to purchase at market prices.   He wishes also to prepare the wayfor a return to normal conditions by raising prices, &amp;ven in theaftercase of the poor, to the level^ expected during the period      the war.
302It is obvious that although Mr. Treub&apos;s proposals are economicallysounder, Mr, Posthuma!s system of cheap distribution of food andclothing if highly popular.   So Mr. Treub is being violentlyattacked for wisely wishing to reduce expenses.     The net result isa system of practical Socialism accidentally introduced by the war.The Socialists hope that the State will continue to feed and olothethe masses, and that once thoroughly introduced the system may bedifficult to abolish when normal times return.It is of some interest to note that a fresh political group hasarisen in Holland calling itself the Economic Union.     It has beenformed to deal with the many difficulties which are certain tofollow the termination of the war when the return to some newstandard cf prices will have to   be faced.     The programme of theUnion contains as the principal pointsParliamentary control of international affairs.Protection of labour in shops and offices.Old age pensions and insurance.7/om8n&apos;s suffrage without class privilege.Taxation in proportion to means.Rise in salaries of Government Servants.The leaders of the Liberal-Democratic Union have issued a warningagainst the Economic Union which it proposes to regard as acapitalist organisation serving the purposes of the jnanufocturerslike the National Liberals in Germany.     Mfc. Trwrlaton even oon-siders it as the first symptom of Dutch Imperialism.     It is notquite clear why the new party should be expected of favouringthe capitalists, as its list of members contains those of damocratswhose pffinci^leo are above suspicion.The Coal Agreement with Germany,The negotiations regarding the supply of coal from Germany and the return concessions from the Netherlands are evidently not proceeding smoothly.   There Ere not wanting signs that the Germans are conduct-ing the negotiations in their usual manner i, e. by bringing pressure
303to bear on the Dutch by more or less veiled threats.     It is not clear what has taken place;   but it would appear certain there is no export to Germany of certain commodities the supply of which from Holland was provided for in the agreement.     It is also of interest to note that so far no safe passage has been obtained from Germany for Dutch colliers proceeding to England for coal.. The difficulties which have arisen also synchronise in a suspicious manner with the extension of the danger zone in the North Sea and with a tendency on tie part of the Germans to grant a larger amount of coal.    Of course it is not possible to draw any definite coh-clusions, but the Liberal Itfess in Holland is very angry over the extension of the zone and1 in some cases have pretested against the action of the Dutch Governmerii in recognising the legitimacy of the submarine war by nego-fciaiirig over a matter of this kind.Feeling in Holland.j     i atIt is very unfortunate that/a critical moment in the war circum-stances should have arisen that have alienated Dutch feeling for the Entente.    While the &quot;Sand and Gravel&quot; question remains un-settled no amount of British propaganda however skilfully directed is likely to have any except the most transitory effect.     Fortu.&quot; nately the Germans in most neutral countries are our finest propa-gandists, as their tactlessness does much to thwart their own effective efforts.     For instance, owing to the stoppage of the Dutch Commercial cables British popularity in Holland has been steadily waning.     Suddenly Germany comes to our assistance by sinking a number of Dutch fishing luggers, an act, quite apart from its inhumanity, of amazing stupidity.     For a time this may divert attention from the pressure of the Entente;   but it can only be temporary.     The Dutch are par excellence a trading people, and
interference with therr commercial interests if continued 4a. willin the end render any propaganda on our part unavailing unless thedirectGermans again commit some/act of aggression.     The most effective propaganda in Holland would be the settlement of the &quot;Sand and Gravel&quot; problem, which is doing untold harm to the good relations between Groat Britain and the Netherlands.     It is presumed that the military reasons for the continuance of the present policy must be vital.
