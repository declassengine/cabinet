SECRET.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 051 HIS BRITA2J1TIC MAJESTY S GOVBRlMiiliTT.E BY THE MEDICAL DEPARTMENT OF BOARD OF EDUCATION OH THE POOD CONTROLLER1S MEMORANDUM ON THE SUPPLY OP MILK FOR YOUNG CHILDREN AND MOTHERS.1.     The Pood Controller^ Memorandum assumes that there is a problem to be met and that it consists in young children of the poorer classes going short of milk because the price is now raised. There is at present no euch problem;   nor is any exact problem, even a prospective one, clearly defined in the Memorandum.     These children have never consumed much milk in any case.     The present does not seem to be an appropriate time to increase such consumption, however desirable on general health grounds.     Milk is scarce but wages are high.2.     If there be a milk problem at the present moment, it would appear to be the increased production and better distribution of milk (rather than its price).3.     There doeo not appear to be any medical evidence that special provision should be made for expectant mothers, who, if they require any extra food, require a substantial and mixed diet, and not milk only.4.     It is submitted that there is insufficient differentiation in the Memorandum between the necessitous and the non-necessitous (though in its opening paragraph the Memorandum definitely speaks of &quot;young children of the poorer classes&quot;).     such differentiation is, however, essential for administrative purposes;   otherwise the working of the scheme will be clogged by the claims of the non-necessitous, who in many districts want milk though they do not require cheap milk. In other words, it is the necessitous child who needs attention.5.    Again, if the Scheme be optional, it will be ineffectivebecause the Local Authorities will be disinclined to increase theirlocal
local rate.     On the other hand, if the scheme be compulsory, it will create confusion unless milk rations are furnished for all sections and ages of the community.6.     The relationship of the County Councils to the scheme is not clearly defined;   nor is it clear why the London County Council should be excluded in favour of the Metropolitan    Boroughs.7.     The Board of Education are most anxious to encourage and facilitate the use of Local Education Authorities and School Care Committees in any National Scheme found to be practicable.   Indeed, it appears to be important to use the existing machinery of the Provision of jvieals Act if and when children show signs of requiring public feeding.     Up to the present there has been no increased demand for school feeding but quite the contrary.     If there be a problem at the present time it is the whole question of feeding the child population and not its relatively small milk consumption only.12th December 1917.
