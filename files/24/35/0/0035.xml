Intelligence Bureau,10Department of Information.WEEKLY   REPORT   Oil   RUSSU.(Dec.  10th,  1917)XXXII.ORW/032.Luring the last week the position of the Bolsheviks has probably-grown stronger.     It is not because their policy is looked on with approval by the majority of the population - the elections to the Constituent Assembly held under the present reign of terror prove the contrary - but because they have   shown themselves far more masterful than any other section of the community.   What strikes tho foreign observer most about the Russian Revolution is the general indifference of the population and the absence of fighting on a large scale.     The story is told of two hostile crowds meeting in Petrograd last May, one bearing banners with &quot;Down with Llilyukov&quot; and the other &quot;Long live Kilyukov&quot;.     In any other European capital such a meeting would have led to bitter fighting and probably bloodshed.     Hot so in Petrograd.     The anti-Milyukot crowd wrested their banners from their oooonents and the crowd gradually dispersed.Of course there has been bloodshed in innumerable instances,accom--nanied by every kind cf excess, but the most characteristic aspect of the revolution has been the fraternisation between what appeared violently hostile bodies.     It is this general apathy - one   might almost say flabbiness - of the Russian population - that provides the explanation of the course      events have taken, and it is this state of mind that the Bolsheviks here known how to use to their own advantage.     By their determination and consistency - as well as by the failure of their opponents - the numbers of the Bolsheviks have steadily increased and, for the present at any rate, will probably continue to increase.       Red the forces om;-osed to them shown the
same unity and the same determined policy they might easily have routed the Bolsheviks at the   outset;    even after the rising at -the&quot;beginning of&quot; November, it was commonly expected that the moder-ates would quickly rout the Petrograd usurpers.Last week we discussed the weakness ond strength of the Bolshevik movement.     Since thenWcent events have emphasised its strength. Their propaganda has spread rabidly along the front.     Headquarters at Mogilev has been captured by them, and even General Shcherbachev1s armies, on what was hitherto the best part of the front, have been affected.     The cessation of hostilities now extends along the whole of the &quot;Eastern front and negotiations with the Germans have begun. So far the success of the Bolsheviks has been easy and rapid.   They are now faced with two problems, both of which will need skill and above all audacity, viz:    the peace negotiations with the Germans and the treatment of the Constituent Assembly.The Peace Negotiations.It is too early as yet to make any prophecy as to whether these will prove successful, but the following feets in connection with them may be noted:    (1) Trotski has offered a general peace to all the belligerents but has emphasised the fr.ct that he is not aiming at a separate peace.    (2) He has     fixed a time limit for the Allies in which to reply with a statement of their war-aims in case they afe not willing to join in the peace negotiations themselves.    (3) He has demanded from the Germans that they shall evacuate the Islands of the Moon Sounds and transfer no troops to the Western front. :*-It is ooseible that if the Allies refuse point blank to discuss peace terms, the Bolsheviks will pass from the-plan of a general peace to one of a separate peace.     Eor the undeniable fact is that Russia cannot fight, and if she cannot fight she must make peace.     It may therefore be taken for granted that within a few days&apos;time the
negotiations will be continued and that the Bolsheviks will do their best to arrive at some t**a?Qaiaaa.J.     Meanwhile the cessation ef hostilities is to continue till Dec, 17th.The Aims and Methods of the Bolsheviks:In considering the policy of the Bolsheviks, it is essential to remember that their methods are not democratic in the popular sense of the word.     There is a vast difference between pooular or repre-sentative government, such as both Kerenski and Milyukov stood for in their different ways, and a dictatorship of the proletariat now set up by the Bolsheviks.     Such a dictatorship cannot of course be long-lived, but it   may well remain in power until certain very definite ends are achieved, the chief of which is peace.The next few weeks will witness experiments in government which may have   the most far-reaching effects upon the general European situation.     Even if the Bolsheviks Conclude a separate peace with the Germans, it will not be a separate peace in the ordinary sense of the wort, as the main object of the Russians is to force a general peace by way of social revolution in every country in Europe. It is not the province of this Reoort to discuss the question whether the ideas of the Bolsheviks are entirely fantastic or whether they may wholly or partly suceed in either the Allied or enemy countries. In all probability Lenin and Trotski do genuinely believe they will succedd.     If we may hazard a guess theii hopes are probably based on the following considerations:   (1) The example of Russia, which has proved that the- proletariat can dictate terms provided it shows the necessary resolution.    (2) The opening of communications be-tween revolutionary Russia and Germany.    (3) The increasing economic difficulties of Germany and Austria-Hungary during the winter.    (4) The publication of the secret documents of the Russian Foreign Office which are calculated to stir up the resentment of all peoples of all
countries against their governments.     At the present moment Trotski is only publishing documents that will compromise the Allies. This is done for two reasons:    (1) To discredit KerenskiTs government and thereby sttengthen his own position, (2) to play upon the revulsion of feeling in Russia against Britain.     This will, he considersj help him in forcing through the peace negotia-tions.     At the same time there is little doubt that once he thinks the moment has come he will adopt the same policy towards Germany by publishing secret treaties with the intentinn of stirring up resentment in Germany against tfche Government.The Constituent Assembly.The elections are not yet complete, but the positions of the three main parties - Bolsheviks, Cadets, Social Revolutionaries -may be regarded as more or less fixed.     The Bolsheviks have a considerable majority, but may not be able to rely on sufficient support from the Social Revolutionaries, but should they oppose the dolsheviks, it seems that the latter will not hesitate to flout the Constituent Assembly itself.The Position of the Ukraine.The cessation of hostilities over the whole of the Eastern front means the inclusion of the Ukraine.     According to the latest-reports the Rada is hostile to the Bolsheviks and friendly to the Cossacks.     Several reasons for   this were suggested in our last-Report,     In spite of this, however, it would not be safe to con-clude that the Ukrainians would stand out of any peace settlement that might;be made by the Russians.     The Ukrainian! leaders may endeavour to turn the weakness of the Russians to their own advaru tage   and it is not unlikely that they may try to impress the Western Powers with their own importance as an independent factor
in European politics.     If Ukrainian nationalism    were not confined to a few intellectuals, an independent Ukraine might he a possibility of the future.     But that is very far from being the case.     As we pointed out in our last Report, the Ukrainian nationalists owe their influence over the peasantry to the provincial, not the national, feeling of the latter.     The peasantry want their own local rights preserved, but have no desire to cut themselves off from Russia politically.     Thus any dealings with Ukrainian leaders would have to be based on the fact that the Ukraine as a whole will almost inevitably form part of Russia in the future.
