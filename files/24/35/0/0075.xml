Oolanel Jones05REPORT OF THE , COMMITTEE ON THE ABOVE BILL. (WAR CABINET a^^INDTE 3    ).PETROLEUM PRODUCTION BILL.It will be rembered that on the 25th October an amendment to the financial resolution leading up to the above Bill wad carried against the Government by 44 to 35.     The House was a small on?;   but from enquiries made it appears thatOpposition to the Bill in its present shape.     It is probable that a large number of members aro strongly opposed to the payment of any royalty for petroleum; and that their opposition is founded * not on the legal argument put forward in someface, but in the general view that, as land has been dealt with in this country without any reference to its containing petroleum, this product should not be treated as private property but should bolong to the Crown.It is obvious that an attempt to determine the above question either one way or the other might lead to long and bitter controversy, which it is desirable to avoid at the present time, - the more so as the presence of petroleum in paying quantities in this country has not yet been established and the controversy might prove to have been merely academic.     The Committee are advised that a regulation can be made under the Defence of the Realm Act giving to the Government tho sole right of boring for and taking petroleum during the war, any question of compensa-tion being left to be determined by the Defence of the Realm (Losses) Commission; and in the circumstances they recommend that tho Bill be dropped and that a Defence of tho Realm Regulation be made in the annexed form.th December, lyi?.
