-s-EShis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;g Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1917.CONFIDENTIAL.Mr. F. 0. LinoUey to Sir E. Drummond.Dear Eric, Petrograd, November 27, 1917.IT is long since I wrote to you, and there is nothing cheerful to say from here.For more than six months I have thought the best thing was to release Russia from her obligation to continue the war. First, I hoped it might be possible to detach Austria on the other side even if it meant Italy going out too. The gain would have been enormous.   It is now presumably too late for that.Since Kornilofs adventure 1 have been certain that, even without Austrian defection, we should be better served by releasing Russia than by keeping her nominally v in the war against the will of practically the whole country. The principal reason for my belief is that Russia cannot, as a matter of fact, make peace alone and that, when she sees this, she will be much less hostile to the Allies, and especially to us, than she is now. My second reason is that, even if peace is made, Germany will get no great advantage out of Russia in her present state. In any case less advantage than she could get by occupying the fertile districts of the Ukrain, which she can do at any time merely by marching forward. Russia has hardly anything to export, and will have less next year than this what she has is almost impossible to move.I know the disadvantages and difficulties Roumania especially. But, if we can beat the Germans, we c-m save Roumania later, and we are more likely to beat them&apos; by giving Russia a free hand than by keeping her nominally in the war against her will. Nor does our insistence on the treaty in any way prevent Russia from making a separate peace in her present mood it has a contrary effect.Don&apos;t be misled into thinking the Bolsheviks an isolated minority. &apos; They are a minority as regards their violent seizure of authority, but in their demand for peace they v voice the whole people with insignificant exceptions.The Ambassador has been much more set on keeping Russia In the war than I; that is why he urged our meeting her desire for a discussion of war aims. It was, of course, the only way to keep her in ; but His Majesty&apos;s Government did not see their way to do it. This makes me feel that there can be no great desire at home to see her continue in the war, in which case we had far better make what we can out of her trying to go out.Things move so quickly that I dare say it will be too late to do anything by the time every one is consulted. When we decided not to discuss war aims was the proper moment to give Russia a free hand.I expect you thought things were much worse than they were during the rows. It was not so bad ; but Tiotzky shows a tendency to twist our tails and we have, of course, no real protection of any sort or kind. The elections to the Constituent Assembly are passing off very quietly here ; no one expects that much attention will be paid to it when it does meet; and the Bolsheviks will certainly not relinquish the real direction of affairs in deference to its wishes. They are practical people, and rely on -the sailors and the Red Guard, who have nothing but apathetic opposition to deal with and have strengthened their position by bringing some old-fashioned men-of-war into the river before it freezes tight-one is just opposite my house.We can do no current work, as all the Ministries are on strike and will, I think, remain so unless there is a Coalition Government. In the meantime, British claims of all kinds are piling up; they will have to be settled by a special commission. I don&apos;t think I have succeeded in settling one, though I have given endless time to them.Yours ever, R 0. L.&apos;T256]
