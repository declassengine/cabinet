BRITISH MUSEUM,LONDON, W.S.12th December 1917.I havo to acknowledge the receipt of your letterof the 11th Decemberon the subject of the application made by Lord Rothermere that accommodation should be found in the British Museum for the staff of the Air Ministry.being made as the result of Lord Rothermere!s recent visit to the Museum,-&apos; T laid the matter before the Trustees last Saturday and was instructed, in the event of an application being made, to state that the Trustees would feel bound to oppose it to the full extent of their power.merely has a commercial value of several millions of pounds, but is a collection of historical and artistic monuments and records of quite immeasureble importance.     It is the principal storehouse in this country of the culture and civilisation which we claim to be defending in the present war.     Its destruction or serious injury would be regarded throughout the civilised world as a calamity of the first order, which would be remembered for centuries after the event; and to expose it to an increased risk of destruction would be held to be an act of almost criminal indifference to the culture which we profess to value and defend.the more valuable contents of the Museum elsewhere, it isimpossible to remove the whole or any large proportion of the whole,     The Library is a national workshop of information, and is in constant use by Government Departments (such as theIn view of the possibility of such an applicationThe Museum contains national property which notWhatever may be done in the direction of removingAdmiralty and War Office) and also by private researchers Inir Arthur I, Burrant.,M.V.O.every
every branch oi&apos; industry.   It could not be clos-od or removed without serious injury to that utilisation of knowledge on which so much, depends, whether for war or peace.   Many of the exhibits are too bulky to remove, 6r are built into the walls and could not be removed without much cost of time and labour. Many others would incur great risk of injury or destruction by removal.   And the removal of all objects which can be moved would also involve a great expenditure of labour and packing materials and transport&apos;.Since therefore the Museum premises cannot be vacated it seems unjustifiable to increase the risk to the collections by Installing in them a Government Department of a combatant nature.   The Museum would then become a legitimate target -for enemy attack.   Whether or not it is possible for hostile airmen to aim their bombs with accuracy (and by day or by-clear moonlight the Museum with its acres of roof and central dome must be one of the most conspicuous objects in London) it is certain that if bombs fell upon it while in the occupa-tion of the Air Ministry, the Germans would claim it as the result of deliberate attack, and we should have no right to complain.   They would also point to it as a proof of our indifference to intellectual culture and matters of the mind, and again we should have no answer.   On the other hand if the Museum were seriously injured by bombs now, Germany would rightly be denounced for such indiscriminate attacks on the artistic treasures of human civilisation, and. it would rank with the bombardment of Rheims and Ypres and the destruc-.ti.D;nof  Louvain among her crimes against humanity.   Unless the moral side of our war against Germany is disregarded(which would greatly weaken our force and prospects of success), considerations such as these should weigh heavily against the proposals now put forward.The
The Trustees have always been anxious to do -what lay within their power to assist tho service of the vzar.   They have, from the earliest days, encouraged the enlistment    of those members of the staff who were of military age. and have lent other members to Government Departments whore their assistance was needed Thev have put tho resources of the Library at the disposal of all Government Departments.     Thoy have providod accommodation for the Medical Research Committe and for the effects of German prisoners of war which thoy have been asked to house,   kore recently they have been askod to take over and provide accommodation for tho War Library now being collected by the Imperial War Museum.    In ways such as this the Trustees are glad to be able to assist the common ca,use.   But they consido that to place a combatant Department on the premises of the iiusoum is to put tho kusoum to an improper use, hardly better than if it were proposed to instal it in a hospital or a church.The Trustees cannot but think that, if those considerations had been present to the mind of the Air Ministry, the proposal would not have boon made; and they earnestly hope that it may be reconsidered.   If it has already gone- forward to the War Cabinet, they ask that thoso representations may be brought to the notice of the Cabinet before a decision is arrived at.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sd.)

9 i nNOT^S ON LETTER FROM SIR FREDERICK KENYON Dated 12th December, 19170The 3ole ground of the protest against the use of the British Museum by the Air Ministry is that the risk of destruction by anti-aircraft will be increased.1,     The Germans have so far given no indication whatever that they endeavour to avoid the destruction of buildings such as the British Museum, however they may be occupied.2.      The following Museums and. Galleries have been in occupation by War Departments for months past:-The National Gallery,The National Portrait Gallery.The National Gallery of British Art.Hertford Rouse,  (Wallase Collection).The London Museum.The Old Royal College of Art.The Imperial Institute, etc.Air raids have occurred since such occupation commenced, but there is no evidence to show that these buildings have been specially attacked on account of the manner in which they are occupied;    some of these buildings are quite as conspicuous as the British Museum.3.     It is stated in the letter under consideration that the Library is already being used by the Admiralty and War Office, while the Medical Research Committee and the Prisoners of War Bureau are already installed in the building. There is, therefore,, already sufficient excuse, if one were needed, for the Germans to attempt the destruction of the Museum on the .grounds that is is being used in active connection.with the war.4o
4, There is no evidence to show that homos dropped from aeroplanes hit any building at which they are aimed, if, indeed, they are aimed at any building in particular..5.     There is no other building in London available which offers the same amount of apace which is considered necessary by Lord Rothermere for the efficient working of his Departmentc     If, therefore, the use of the British Museum is refused on the grounds stated in the letter, my Department will be unable to comply with the demand of the Air Ministry,6.      It will be remembered that the Mar Cabinet recently decided that sucli of the exhibits in the Museum as could be removed (a lar^e proportion of the whole) are to be stored in a place of safety as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made..ALFRED MOM). 13th December, 1917*
