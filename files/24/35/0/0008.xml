[This Document is the Property of His Britannic 3flajesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1917,SECRET.NAVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION-No. 28. Week ended 1st December.NAVAL OPERATIONS. Mines have been laid off the West Frisian Islands. * North Sea.The weather has again been unfavourable for flying, but numerous patrols have Manders been carried out.  Two enemy machines were shot down completely out of control. andDuring the period 4th-17th November, R.N.A.S. Squadrons Nos. 8 and 10 attached France-to the R.E.C. in N.E. France have destroyed 3 enemy machines and 1 kite balloon, and have driven down 6 machines out of control.    They have also co-operated in infantry attacks and have fired a large number of rounds at ground targets from low altitudes. One of our pilots has been killed and one is missing.The laying of deep mines in the Straits of Dover has been continued.On November 29th the monitor &quot; Sir Thomas Picton &quot; bombarded the Piave line Mediter-and destroyed two bridges. ranean.On November 27th the destroyer &quot; Lizard &quot; shelled and dispersed a party of Turks North of Jaffa.The eneniy have again shelled Mavro Island (5 miles N. of Tenedos) but no damage was done.    \   &apos;Enemyj^eroplanes have made a night attack on Sukerair (on the coast about 20 miles N.N.E. ojj^aza) but did no damage. :R.N.A.S. machines have bombed Drama aerodrome on 2 occasions, on one of which a hangar was destroyed by a direct hit. They have also bombed Adrianople, Pravista, where 7 bombs were dropped in the town, Gallipoli, where great damage is reported, and Galata aerodrome, where a hangar was hit.The airship &quot; S.S.P.2 &quot; has been lost whilst on patrol off the Orkneys through engine Casualties, failure forcing her to come down in the sea.   One officer and two men are missing. A seaplane has been lost whilst on patrol in the Channel but the crew were rescued.ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.During the week under review 10 or 11 large enemy submarines have been located, Submarine activity being mainly confined to the. English Channel, Irish Sea and Bay of Biscay.       operating.The submarine cruiser,&quot; which is now believed to be only another of the converted &quot; Deutschland &quot; type, was last heard of on November 2&apos;6th in the&apos; vicinity of the Azores. Another large boat, possibly of the same type1, is working her way slowly outward probably bound for the same Waters.(c 803)   55   12/17   h &amp; s
The important, feature in the submarine campaign during the last few days is the adoption of the English Channel route by practically all outward bound U boats.  Until s     recently this was the exception, now it is the rule, and seems likely to continue until the new protective measures in view prove effective.Actions The following Table shows the number of actions with enemy submarines in Homewith enemy Waters during recent weeks, and the nature of the craft which have been engaged, and submarines. ajso ^ num^er 0f submarines destroyed : 	Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		t Week ended		November 11th.

The percentage of losses in Overseas trades marks a considerable increase on the previous week as regards tonnage, although the number of vessels lost in these trades is reduced. Owing, however, to considerably reduced losses in the Cross-Channel traffic (&quot;44 as against 1&apos;23), the percentage of loss in the total traffic to and from the United Kingdom is less than last week. - On the other hand &quot; Losses on other Routes &quot; shows an increase from one vessel to five vessels.The table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all BritislrMerchant Vessels Ar^as in sunk, damaged or molested, and of all Allied and Neutral Merchant Vessels sunk in the whic^ last two weeks by enemy craft and by mine classified according to areas. vessels lostIt will be observed that the submarine operations of the enemy have this week been largely concentrated in the waters surrounding Great Britain.ENEMY MINES.There has again been little enemy minelaying activity during the week, the Lowestoft, Minelaying. Harwich and Nore areas alone having been affected. *     .The following table shows the number of enemy mines destroyed and British Vessels Casualties, sunk by mine in Home Waters in recent weeks : Week Ended.

Convoy. Of the 705 ships convoyed 334 were engaged in the French Coal Trade and 157 on the Scandinavia Lerwick Humber Route, the remaining 214 being engaged in overseas trade, 113 inward and 101 outward. There have been 3 losses in convoy, 1 in the homeward convoy from Gibraltar, 1 in the outward convoy from Milford Haven, and 1 engaged jn the French Coal Trade.During the week 42 Merchant Vessels have been fitted to take Defensive Armament.

Three Dazzle . further ships have been sunk by enemy Submarine, making a total of, 9 ships.   1,438 Painting, voyages have been made to date.(C 803) A 9,
MOVEMENTS OF ENEMY SHIPS.Merchant-men.Seven enemy merchant ships have this week arrived at and five have sailed from Norwegian ports (outside the Cattegat). None have arrived at or left Rotterdam, but nine are said to have left Delfzyl for Swedish ports with enemy coal.A aider. It is reported that an enemy raider, which may have been the Steamship &quot; Wolf,&quot;&apos; was in the Indian Ocean just north of the Equator for a few days at the commencement of October, and it is probable that this vessel about this time laid mines off Bombay, one of which destroyed a merchantman in the week ending the 17th ultimo.BRITISH WARSHIP CONSTRUCTION.British , The following is a statement of Warships and Auxiliary Vessels completed duringWarships    the last three months:  recently completed,Description of Vessels. *	September.	* October.

These Cf oss-Channel barges are included, as they replace merchant vessels in the conveyance of stores to France. During 1917, 134 of these barges, representing 19,430 tons, have been delivered.The 3 train ferries intended for Cross-Channel traffic have also been completed in November. These vessels in their construction have required considerably more labour and steel than do vessels of a normal type and equivalent tonnage, but, on the other hand, they are capable of being loaded and unloaded much more rapidly than ordinary vessels. Each is able to carry 52 loaded wagons and it will be possible to use them for the transport of   Tanks &quot; loaded on railway trucks;It will be seen that the figure of new construction for November is higher than in any previous month of this year and is practically identical with the average monthly output of 1913 the record year of British mercantile shipbuilding, &apos;and this notwithstanding that we are now building a vastly larger warship tonnage, than has ever been built in this country before.(C 803)A 3

Italy.On November 14th two Light Cruisers with a number of Destroyers approached the mouth of the Piave but&apos;were driven off by Italian coast batteries.As long as the Piave line holds it is not expected that Venice will be attacked from the Sea, but should it be necessary to retire to the Brenta line, attack might be expected. Information has been received that the Austrians are preparing floating batteries for this purpose.On November 28th an enemy Light Cruiser and six Destroyers attempted to bombard the Adriatic railway line between Sinigaglia and Rimini, but retired on the appearance of Submarines from Ancona, without inflicting any damage.Greece.The British Naval Mission, charged with the reorganisation of the Greek Fleet, has arrived in&apos; Greece.Russia.Admiral Verderevsky vacated the office of Minister of Marine on November 24th in order to avoid the suspicion of implication in negotiations relative to the armistice. His second Assistant temporarily assumed the office, but he was-eventually forced to resign on the 28th in favour of Captain IvanofE.Gains and If the losses of British ships by enemy action during November are compared withfosses in new British construction alone, the adverse balance for the month is only about 10,000 tons. In no previous month of this year has this adverse balance been less than 100,000 tons, and in April it was nearly 500,000 tons.If, however, the gains and losses from all causes during November are considered, the gains for the first time this year exceed the losses, the net gain for the month being 10,500 tons, as will be seen from the following statement which has been compiled in con-junction with the Ministry of Shipping and which shows the position of British merchant tonnage of 500 tons gross and upwards on the 30th of November, 1917, as compared with the 31st of October, 1917.Tons (Gross).Tonnage of British Mercantile Marine at 31st October, 1917 ...    15,558,744Adjustment per Ministry of Shipping ... ... ... 48,010-- 15,510,734
It is reported that the whole of the Black Sea fleet has hoisted the Ukrainian flag, indicating allegiance to the new Independent Government of the Ukraine, which refuses recognition of the Petrograd Government.I Brazil.Boiler tubes for three of the seven inefficient Destroyers will shortly reach Brazil. The extent to which Brazilian men-of-war can be used to co-operate with the Allied forces is under consideration, and until this is determined numerous requests for naval war material have jbeen left in abeyance.Chile.The Submarines ceded by H.M. Government to Chile are still detained in U.S.A., nominally for1 alterations, but actually until their torpedo armament is shipped from England- It is expected that they will leave New London, Conn., for Chile towards the end of December.-, Colombia.The, Colombian Senate has adopted a resolution protesting against &quot;ruthless&quot; submarine warfare on merchant shipping, and recommending the refusal of the use of Colombian ports to submarines of.nations using this illegal method of warfare. - This marks a distinct step towards a more friendly attitude to the United States and the Allied cause.Naval Staff.Gih December, 1917.[Appendices.
