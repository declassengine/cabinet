ASSISTANCE TO ITALY.Copy of letter from Italian Ambassador to the Prime,Ministeri2,0, Grosvenor -Square,.  London. Dec. 13th, 1917.My dear Prime Minister,As I fear to prevail on the extreme kindness which you have, always&apos; shown to me by taking too much of your most valuable time, I beg to enclose.herewith the translation of a telegram just received from our prime Minister.   The telegram speaks for itself .   It does not call for further comments on my part .Nobody knows better than I how the great, importance in the general allied interest of the Italian front has been for many months appreciated by your lucid intuition.   . I am also aware that you look fully alive to the gravity of the present situation .I venture therefore to express my firm confidence that the earnest entreaties of Signor Orlando will be considered by. yourself and your colleagues of the War Cabinet with the sympathy which they obviously deserve, and that you will accordingly see your way to adopt prompt and adequate measures .With the highest regard, and most cordial feelingsbelieve me ,my dear- Prime Minister,Yours most sincerely,(Sgd .).     IMPERIALI.
E.H CLOSURE.Copy of&apos; telegram from Italian Prime Minister to the Italian Ambassador in London,While I am waiting to hear the results of your action in which I have full confidence, I deem necessary that you should point out , that all the facts, as well as all the informations we receive, disclose in a tangible form, the enemy&apos;s intention to push to the utmost extent the offensive against us .Apart from the intense continuation of the offensive with still more numerous and fresher troops , it appears to me that, even for a non-military man, it is easy to realise that the enemy would not sacrifice their troops for the mere purpose of conquering a few square kilometres. The aim of the enemy is very clear.   They evidently mean to debouch in the plains and to smash definitely our resistance . Accordingly it seems obvious that the common interest of the allies is to bring their&apos;greatest effort to Italy, in view of the fact that the winter campaign will be fought there, and that the consequences of a defeat would be irreparable for the interests of the whole alliance ,
