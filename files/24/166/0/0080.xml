(THIS DQOUMBKT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC        Jv)AJSSTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT) .Wira1ess Services.C A E I 1! E T.     ,1.  The Committee appointed by the Cabinet to consider this question met Mr, Marconi and Colonel Simpson (theChairman and Deputy Managing Director of tho Marconi Company)on tho 14th April, when the policy favoured by the Governmentwas indicated to them.   Thoy stated that it was the&quot;Company&apos;s &quot;most earnest desire in the Country&apos;s interest toassist the Government In every way possible, and whatever its decision might be&quot; .   They urged that co-operation betweenthe Government and the Company was necessary if the maximum of efficiency was to be secured;  but thoy explicitly affirmedthat, whatever the decision night be, the Government might&quot;rely upon one thing, that the Company bowed to the deoisionand would assist all they could&quot; .     2.  They stated, however, that in the Company&apos;s opinion the position had been changed by Mr. Marconi&apos;s  recentexperiments in short-wave directive transmission, and thoysuggested that the Company should be licensed on a temporary basis to erect and work a station of the new type for communication with Australia, with a view to its possibleacquisition by the Government if it proved satisfactory.   Asa result of the interview, the Company&apos;s representatives were asked to put forward definite proposals  in writing,  and togive full information respecting the new system to the PostOffice experts, with such demonstration  of its working as might he practicable.
     3.  The Company&apos;s written proposals were received onthe 17th instant.   They are particularly unsatisfactory, inview of the above-mentioned assurances of the Company&apos;representatives.   The Company say that their proposals are consistent with State control, but it is obvious that the&quot;oontrol&quot; which they have in mind is something quite different from tha simple policy of State ownership and operation of theEmpire Stations in this Countrys which was recommended by theDonald Committee.   They nave in fact reverted to the fruitlessattempts of last year to combine State ownership with privateenterprise.   They suggest various  alternatives, including theestablishment of a new Company under joint Marconi and government auspices, and including the pooling arrangement which was under discussion last jd&amp;uZcy.   But they make no suggestion directed towards co-operation on tha basis of the                     mDonald policy.   Whether or not they are simply aiming at delay,their letter is admirably adapted to achfe\yva that and.     4.  Meanwhile, Mr. Marconi has explained tha Company&apos;snew system to the Post Office experts, who have also witnesseda demonstration at the Poldhu Station.   The system is stillin an experimental stage.   It depends partly on the use of short wavss of about ,100 metres, which experimenters generallyhave found to give.good results in long range transmissionduring tho night hours, and partly on tha use of reflectingaerials for transmitting tha waves on the principle of thaparabolic reflectors used for Searchlights.   A similarreflector Is proposed for focussing the received waves.   Thereflectors are the only contribution of the Marconi Companybeyond common practice;  and their precise affect has not been investigated, except for a short period between this Countryand Cape Verde, a distance of about 2,500, miles.   In that caso                                                    tha
the reception of  signals from Poldhu was possible at GapeVerde not only during the night hours but also for about an hour before sunset and an hour after sunrise.   Judging fromthese results and from theoretical considerations, It isestimated that stations of the now type, with a power of26 kilowatts and  costing about  20,000 each, would givecommunication averaging 15 hours a day between this Country and canada, 11 hours  a day between this Country and South africa and India, and from 5 to 7 hours a day between this Countryand Australia according ao the Australian Station was in theeast or west of that Continent.   The hours, being dependent onthe altitude of tho sum, would be shorter during the  Englishsummer and longer during the English winter.   The Companyclaim that, during the best hours of communication, a speed of 100 words per minute might be obtained, as compared with the speed of from 40 to 60 words per minute attainable by means ofsuper stations of the type hitherto contemplated.     5.  The number of hours of communication cannot bomaterially increased by the increase of power or otherwise,as the short waves employed cannot travel groat distancesduring daylight.   Communication being confined to the hou soutside the ordinary business day, stations of the new typewould only he suitable for deferred traffic, ,  Further, thedirection of transmission from the same station is practicallyfixed.   For long-distance communication at all hours, and forsimultaneous transmission in all directions, these stations would be useless, and  super, stations are necessary.   even for the limited purposes mentioned,  the new type of stationcannot, in the opinion of the Government experts, be fullytested for communication between England and the distantDominions in less than about two years.     6.  Broadly speaking, if the new type of station fulfils                                          &apos;Jl   &apos;      the
the claims made for it, it would seem to he useful as anauxiliary to super stations, hut not as a substitute for them.From a strategic point of view, the Admiralty experts considerthat the inability of the stations to communicate in alldirections simultaneously and during the whole of the day isa fatal objection.   They also consider that such stations would be very liable to interference in time of war,,   In theiropinion, super stations will still he necessary for strategicpurposes not only in this Country, hut also in the principalDominions and India.     7.  If the Dominions or India should desire to try tho new type of station, there is&apos;no reason why arrangements shouldnot be made for the erection of corresponding stations inthis Country;  but there is no need to give a licence to the marconi Company for this purpose.   Any further experimental work which may he necessary can be carried out by means of thoirPoldhu station.   The reflecting system at this station issited towards Cape Verde, Pernambuco, Rio de Janeiro andMontevideo.   It has so far been tested only as far as cape verde j  but it would he quite easy for tho Company to test itat the other places mentioned, covering ranges up to about,000 miles.   To give a licence to the Company for Empirestations in this Country, even on a temporary basis, would beto run counter to tho polioy recommended by the DonaldCommittee, and would only give rise to future trouble.   Itwould, however, he quite in accordance with that polioy toallow the Company to provide stations of the new type asContractors for the Government, subject to the price beingreasonable, and subject to the stations fulfilling theconditions as to speed and hours of working indicated byMr. Marconi as practical possibilities.     8.   Meanwhile it is obvious that the supter station                                              already
already in course of construction at Rugby should be     648oorapleted (as a 16-mast station), and that the existingstation at Leafield should also be enlarged ae proposed bythe Donald Committee,,    The total additional expenditure is estimated at about S1SO.?000. but half of this willprobably not fall to be spent until next financial year,,,It is equally obvious that the erection of the second stationequivalent to Rugby, and even the acquisition of a sitefor that station, should be postponed until the furtherviews of the Dominions have been obtained.   If Australia,South Africa and India all proceed with super stations,this second station would of course be required,,     9, The Cabinet Committee, having received the reportof the Government experts, and having considered the matter in all its bearings, came to the following conclusions    (1) The Rugby station to be completed as arranged        (with 16 masts) and the enlargement of Leafield to        be proceeded with immediately afterwards 0    (2) The Dominions and India to be communicated with        immediately on the linos of the annexed draft        telegram.&apos;    (This telegram has already been sent).    (3) If any of the Dominions or India wish to try the        short-wave directive system, the necessary station        or stations in this Country to be ordered by the        Government from the Marconi Company as Contraotors,        subject  (a) to certain specifled requirements&quot;                                                    being      t* Esoscrequlreinents should be generally on the lines held out by the Marooni Company as reasonable probabilities, but well within them.   For inotance, the hours of working should be within the limits mentioned in paragraph 4,above, and the speed of working, while approximating to the limit of 100 words mentioned by Jir0 Marconi, should be well within that limit.
         being fulfilled;  (b) to the price&apos;  being         reasonable;  and (o) to the payment of a moderate         royalty (say 5fs on the gross revenue), so long as         any Marconi patents essential for this system are         used,,   &apos;(&amp;)   The question of Empire Wireless polioy to he         settled independently of any ether matters and         before any concessions are given to the Company         in respect of Foreign ooinraunioatipri,     10o I submit these recommendations for the acceptanceof the Cabinet, and I suggest that a reply should he sentto the Marconi Company in accordance therewith, and that,simultaneously, an announcement of the polioy of theGovernment should he made to the House of Commons and thePresc0   I think that the announcement might he made in the                 IBform annexed,-/  The estimated oapital cost is given by Mr. Marconi as  within  20,000 per station.
Telegram from Secretary of btate for the colonies to Governors-General of Canada, Commonwealth of    Australia, new Lea land and the Union of         pp;n        South Africa.  Sent 3.50 p.mv, 1st May,                        1924,.ia y j  C onf identla 1,     My telegram 10th April:  tireless.   At Conferencewjth Cabinet Committee 14th April Marconi suggested reconsideration of H.k. Government^ proposals in view of process madewith his experiments in transmission by means of short-wavesand reflectors,     This system, which is still ir experimental sta-e, hasbeen examined by Government experts,   It deoends oartly onuse of short waves of about 100 metres which experimentersgenerally have found to give good results in long-rangetransmission during hours of darkness, and partly on use ofreflecting aerials for transmitting waves on principle ofparabolic reflectors used for seaech-lights,   A similarreflector is proposed, for focussing received waves.   Preciseeffect of reflectors, which are the only contribution ofMarconi Company beyond common practice, has net been investigatedexcept between this country and Cape Verde, a distance ofabout  2500 miles.   In that case receotion of signals waspossible *not only during darkness but also for about an hourbefore sunset and an - hour after sunrise.   Judging from these results and from theoretical considerations estimated thatstations of new type with power of 25 kilowatts and costing about   20,000 each would give communication averaging 15 hours a  day between this country and Canada, 11 hours a day between this country  and South Africa and India, and 5 to V hours aday between this country and Australia, according as AustralianStation wos in East or &apos;i?est,   Latter period voigbt be increasedto some extent by transmission through an intermediate station.                                        j!dours being dependent on altitude of  sun would be shorterduring English summer and longer during English winter.It is claimed that during best hours soeed                              -1-vi
of 100 words par minute might he obtained.      It must be clearly understood that number of hourscannot be materially increased by increase of power orotherwise, and that direction of transmission from samestation is practically fLxedo   Communication being confined to hours outside ordinary business day, stations of new type would only be suitable for deferred traffic,    3?or long distance comiuuhication at all hours and for simultaneoustransmission in all directions these stations would be useless and super stations of type hitherto contemplated would be necessary.      From a strategical point of view new system fails in three respects -      Firstly it is necessary that each Government concerned should be able to convey important orders or informationwithout delay to fleets&quot; Armies or Aircraft,    The partialservice of the new system does not fulfil this condition.      Secondly, Broadcasting is necessary to  ships and it  maybe desired to transmit to all ships simultaneously in allwaters,,      Thirdly, the new system appears peculiarly susceptible to deliberate interference by reflector stations set up onthe line of communication and so placed as not to  interferewith the interferers own communications.      This could be done at small cost and might result inthe paralysing of our w/T communication in war time if thissystem were to be solely relied on0      Deliberate interference with High Power long wavestations is a matter of rjreat cost and cannot be done withoutinterfering with tho interferers own communications.      Hoi...government, considering super-station commuuica-tion essential has decided so far as this  country  is
           concerned,  to complete Rugby Station and  enlarge  Leafield                                                                 9\ % 9           as  proposed by Donald  Committee,  but will postpone  commsncV           ment  of second Rugby Station pending consideration  of  new           proposals by Governments  of Dominions concerned and  India.              Government experts consider that stations of  new type           oould  not be erected, and  fully tested for  communication           between England and  aictant  Dominions under conditions of           various seasons in less than about two years.Omitted to    J, If your Government  desire to  try station of new  type,Canada.           Imperial Government will reciprocate  by arranging for           corresponding  station here.*j   Marconi Company have asked for           licence  to  erect and work such a  station, at least for           limited  period, but  instead  of granting this H.M. Government           would  give  order to  Company  to erect  such a station as           contractors for Government,  station  to fulfil certain           specified requirements as to  hours and speed of working           and other matters  within limits mentioned above, and           only to be  accepted  and paid  for if  these requirements           fulfilled.               Generally speaking new  type of  station seems useful           as  auxiliary only to super  stations  but not as substitute           for them, and,  if Governments of Dominions concerned and           India  take*this view and arrange for  erection of super           stations, second Rugby Station will  be built here as           proposed by Donald committee               Company admit that they are committed to ereotion of           super  station  in South Africa, but hope Union Government           will agree  to  substitution of short-wave directive station.           They do  not  oonsider themselves committed in case of           Australia,  because although  they have tendered for super           station and  tender has been  accepted by Australian Company,           agreement has  not been signed by Marconi Company.
     As regards  Canada, BUM. Government propose totake over service at this end by means of enlargedLeafield or station of new type according to whetherCanadian Company continue to use Glaeo Bay or erectstation of new type0 Tos trali&amp;? Zealand1 Union ofh Africa only.  To-Canada only.     ELM, Government hope to receive very earlytelegraphic reply conveying views of your Government,but they would ask that matter should be kept confidentia3for tho present since no announcement made here yet orintimation of position given to Marconio     KcM, Government would ask that matter should bekept confidential for tho present since no announcementmade here yet or intimation of position given to Marconi,
654          Proposed  announcement  of Policy.     The  Government have  decided to adopt the main recommendations  of the  Donald Committee  in regard to theEmpire Wireless  Service,  viz.     (1)  That tha State  through the Post Office should own          all wireless stations  in Great  Britain for          communication  with the overseas Dominions, Colonies,          Protectorates  and territories;  end     (2)  That tha Post Office  should operate directly, under          an Improved business organisation, all the Empire          stations  in Great Britain.     Thoy have further  decided, as recommended by the Commit toethat the  new high-power station, now building at Rugby,should ha extended to a 16-mast station;  and that, as soonas this station  is completed, the existing Post Officestation at Leafiold should ha enlarged.     The  British and of the Canadian service will be taken.over by the Post Office as soon as arrangements can ba mado asregards a station  in this Country.     In the meantime the  klarooni Company have suggested thatit will suffice  if stations of  their new &quot;beam&quot; type aroerected in tha Dominions  and India, with correspondingstations  in this Country  for each line of communication.   Thenew  system has so  far only been tried experimentally, andthat only over a distance- of about ,2500  miles, but it is claimed by the Company  that^stations cf  thin typo, with power of  25 kilowatts and oooting sorruv ,120,000&apos; egght, wouldgive communication over tho necessary distances during thehours of  darkness  and for about an hour  before sunset andafter sunrise.   During the best hours a comparatively high    ?speed might he obtained.   Communication being confined to                                                 the
tho hours outside tho ordinary business day, stations ofthis type would only lie suitable for deferred traffic.   Forlong distance communication at all hours and for simultaneoustransmission in all directions (conditions which theGovornment regard as essential both for strategic and forother reasons) super stations of the type of that beingerected at Rugby will admittedly be necessary.-   The Admiraltyexports also advise that stations of the new type could notbe relied on in time of war, as they would he particularlyliable to interference.     The Government are in communication with the Dominionsand India on the subject.   If the latter take their viewthat stations of the new type could at best only be regardedas adjuncts to super stations, and if Australia, South africa and India accordingly proceed with their arrangements forthe erection of super stations, the Government^ will (asproposed by the Donald Committee) erect a second station hereequivalent to the Rugby station.   If on the other hand theDominions or India desire to try stations of the new type,the Government will co-operate by asking the idarooni company to erect Corresponding stations hero as contractors to theGovernment - the stations to fulfil certain specifiedrequirements as to hours and speed of working and othermatters vdthin the limits of tho Company!s claims.   these stations, however, like, other &quot;stations in this Country forEmpire communication;, would be owned and worked by theGovernment.
