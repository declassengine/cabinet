She Unemployment Committee  submit  to  the  Cabinet the        following conclusions&apos; and&apos; recommendations  on certain        questions which have been examined by the  Committee since        the date, 29th February 1924,  of  their  Second Interim        Report (CcPcl43/24) which the  Cabinet approved at their        Meeting on Wednesday March 5th 1924  (Cabinet 18/24        Conclusions 4-6 inclusive), OP      20 With reference to C.P. 156(24)  (4) 16,  the CommitteeOS(HIM&quot;   report that as a result of certain negotiations the Port ofiKIOJKGS-.London Authority are prepared to abandon  any claim theymay have on the Government for financial  assistance on thebasis pf a loan at Z^fo and to undertake the  SurreyCommercial Docks and Tilbury Works on  the usual  financial&quot;terms given by -the Unemployment Grants Committee,  viz: halfthe&quot;interest on the lsans for a period of 15 years.   In the case of Tilbury,  however, the Port of London Authority wishto substitute for the Unemployment Grants Committee&apos;sconditions as to recruitment of labour certain special conditons which are in force for the work at the  SurreyCommercial Docks,   In the latter case a  farther difficultyarises in that the contract for the werk  was let without  anycondition being imposed that only British materials should, be used and the Authority are reluctant to&quot;draw the attention of their contractors to the matter  atthe present time.
     The Unemployment Grants Committee wore doubtful whether ifoonoaEsions are made In the present case it would bo possible&apos;&apos;J0 Ltai maintain the normal conditions in other cases.   It might bepossible to distinguish between tha Hlbury case (where the work had not yet started)and the Surrey Commercial Docks case  (whorework had begun) but there was soma reason to believe that thelate Minister of Labour had agrood tc assist both the schemes on              in respect cf labour.exceptional terms^ /  Moreover, It was doubtful whether the port of London Authority would proceed on the new financial basis unletheir proposals as* a whole were aooepted.     In these circumstances the Committee invite the Cabinet to approve the following action whioh has been taken by the Cemmittein anticipation of Cabinet sanotion:-     (l) Jo take note that the Port of London        Authority were now prepared to carry out        the Surrey Commercial Docks and IPilbury        Schemes on the nczrmal Unemployment Grants        Committee financial terms, viz., half the        Interest on loans for a period of 15 years        and to abandon tho previous financial        arrangemants undor whioh the Government        were to lend tho Authority  4,500,000 at            for 30 years.(2)  That having regard  to  (1) abccve and  also    to the arrangements  entered  into  by tho    late Minister  of Labour with  the Port of    London Authority, tha  Committee bava    authorissd the Unemployment Grants    Committee to give favourable  consideration    to an application from the Port of    London Authority for financial  assistance    on the normal  basis subjeot to  the    following ezoeptions -    (i) That as regards recruitment of labour       in both the Surrey Commercial  Docks       and Tilbury schemes there shall  ba       substituted for the arrangements usually  in       force the  terms agreed with the       Contractors which  in effeot are  aB follows:-* The Oontraotors undertake in order tc secure that London labour shall so far as practicable be employed on the work that unskilled labour shall be recruited through tho Labour Exchanges but any men engaged otherwise who have been  during the past six months oontinually residentif\ll
        In London shall be deemed to have        boon  recruited through the Labour        Exchanges; the Contractors to have        ,the solo  right of rejection of any        men and their foremen  to co-operate       . with  the  Labour Exchange officials        in the selection; In tha oase of        equal qualifications preferenca to        be given  to ex-service men,1(ii)  That in  the  oase of the Surrey Commercial     Looks soheme the condition that only-     British  materials are to be u-sod,  should     be waivedo3,     The Committee have had under oonBideration aproposal that the Unemployment Grants Oommitteoshould give financial assistance -towards the proposedconstruction by the Pembrokeshire County Councilof a Light Railway from St. Davids to Mathry Halt ata cost of  15.0000;  &quot;when constructed the line to beleased in perpetuity to the Great Western RailwayCompany for  3,750 per annum, representing half theinterest on the cost of construotiono  The work willemploy 500 men for 18 months and will assist in theagricultui^al development of the district,     The Committee are informed that the Minister ofTransport is not satisfied that the Railway Companycould not undertake the work without assistance,  andthat in any appears the particular scheme is not one ofgraat urgency and importance or cne which should be given priority on the ground of special unemployment in thedistrict.   If approved the oase would constitute ait
 very undesirable  precedent.    It  might  be  possible to persuade  the  Company  to  undertake  the work unassisted&apos;if satisfied that a  reasonable return on the expenditure would in  effect  be guaranteed  under Section 58  (1) of the Railways Act, 1921,      The  Committee recommend the  Cabinet:-      (l)   That having regard to the serious           political  and  other  objections to           the Government entering into  future           commitments with  the Railway  Companies,           of the  nature  suggested by  the Minister           of Transport)  the Minister  of Transport           &quot;should  not be  authorised either  -           (a) to  inform  the Companies that while              the Government cannot,  of course,              tie the hands of the Rates Tribunal,              they would, so far  as their  influence              goes,  endeavour  to  see  that  nothing              should be  done to deter the  Companies              from embarking capital  in useful              extensions *           or, if  this assurance did not satisfy              the Companies -           (b) to  inform  the Companies that, if              they desire,  Section 58 (1)  (b)              will be amended  so  as to  make it              clear  that expenditure  on works              certified  by  the Minister to be              cf  public  utility will  not be              regarded as not  having  enhanced the              value  of their undertakings.      (2)   That the Unemployment Grants  Committee           should  be  authorised to reply to the           Promoters  of the  St, Davids1  Light           Railway Scheme that, having-regard to           the present position of the financial           relations  between the Government and           the Railway Companies the Government           do not  consider that the grant of           financial  assistance to the St,  Davids&apos;           Light  Railway  Scheme would  be justifiable           at the  ore sent time.
                                                                to p -9PLOYMENT     4.    The Committee have  examined a proposal that     ,;f*OiDIHG*        wlth a view  to  the encouragement of the  building            of  tramp steamers  the  Government should  advance one            half of the  cost of construction free  of interest            for 5 years  and at 2-$% interest  for a  further  period            of  5 years,  the capital  to  be  repaid at  or  before  the            conclusion of the  10 year period.                        .are                 The Cabinet/reminded of the similar proposals            recently submitted by  Lord  St. Davids  and of the            decision of  the Cabinet  regarding assistance to private            enterprise CP. 156 (24) para.29.   It may  also be noted            that there are  signs of  a real revival of activity            in  the shipbuilding industry whioh might be prejudiced            by  Government action of  the kind indicated.                 The Committee recommend the Cabinet:-                     To  take note  of and approve the view                     of  the Committee that the above scheme                     for assisting the  construction  of  tramp                     steamers  is not one which the Government                     should entertain.5&quot;
9 9 \J .JLAND RECLAMATION. taterialiprainagefichemes.leolamation,m King&apos;a Lynnfcslamationicherce,5.   The Committee have further investigatedMemoranda by former and the present Ministers ofAgriculture and Fisheries respectively on thequestion of Land Reclamation as a means of relievingunemployment -     The Cabinet are reminded that provision hadbeen made in the Estimates for 1924/25 for theexpenditure of a sum of  250,000 on arterial drainageschemes.   As a result of further examination theMinister of Agriculture is disposed to think thatthis sum might, with advantage, be  increased to 350,000;  he does not, however, propose to ask foran increased provision at the moment, though later in the year he may decide to return to the matter inthe event of schemes materialising to a greater extent than had been experienced in previous years.     The Cabinet will remember that the Ministry ofAgriculture and Fisheries have consistently reportedagainst the general policy of land reclamation.There are, however, certain exceptional case wherethe reclamation of land is not open to the very serious objections which can usually be urged, against  thegeneral policy.   The Minister of Agriculture has laidbefore the Committee certain exceptional schemes from among which  the Committee have selected the followingscheme for special consideration.     During  the war German prisoners had reclaimedcertain land belonging to the Office of Woods  andForests about  seven miles from King&apos;3 Lynn.   Whileit  is difficult &apos;io estimate the precise economicresult of this particular reclamation there is nodoubt that the  land reclaimed is now valuable  land.Adjoining the  area  in  question is  another  area of                  -6-
                                                   (:, 0 Liabout 390 acres which the Office of Woods and Forestsare prepared to reclaim if the cost of the undertakingcan be borne by the Exchequer,   The work would be doneby contract&apos;, the labour would be obtained mainly fromKing&apos;s Lynn, 300 to 400 men would be employed and the wage paid would probably have to be at a rate somewhatin excess of the Agricultural rate.   While it isdifficult to estimate the cost of reclamation It is roughly calculated that this might reach  80 an acre,or  32,000 for the undertaking.   After two or threeyears time the reclaimed land might be worth  40 anacre.     It is suggested that the King!s Lynn Scheme mightbe undertaken by the Government as an experiment fromwhich valuable data would be obtained.   On the otherhand it may be pointed out that this Scheme is onewhere the conditions are peculiarly favourable andthat it may not be possible to draw any too general conclusions from res\ilts shown by the scheme.According to the estimates the value cf the land, whenreclaimed will be  only half the cost of reclamation andit may therefore be represented that the money couldbe more profitably expended in other forms of unemploy-ment relief.     The  Committee recommend  the Cabinet:-      (1)  To approve in principle the proposal of          the Minister  of Agriculture and Fisheries          that  the  king&apos;s Lynn Reclamation Scheme          should be undertaken by the Office of          floods and Forests as an experiment at an          estimated cost  to the Exchequer of  32,000          spread over at  least two  financial years.      (2)  That  the  Minister of Agriculture and          Fisheries should be  requested, to confer          with  the  Chancellor  of the Exchequer as          to the provision  of  the sum of  32,000          in question.
6.In the course of the foregoing discussion the Committee were informed that a substantial amount of business was being held up owing to thefailure to pass the Trade Facilities Bill into law.,In particular reference was made to foreign orders from Japan ana elsewhere whioh would be placed inthis country in any cases in which the TradeFacilities Committee are in a position to approve the applications.     The Committee agreed to recommend to theCabinet:-Shat every effort should be madeto expedite the early passage into law of the Trade Facilities Bill,Signed on behalf of   the Committee,,(Sd. )  SIDES?
