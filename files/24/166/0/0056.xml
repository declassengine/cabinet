[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)                      Printed for the Cabinet.     April 1924.SECRET.CP. 256 (24).  -Proposed Protective  Duties on  Steel imported into  India.    I circulate, for the consideration of the&apos; Cabinet, a transcript of a Memorandumon proposals for imposing protective duties on  steel imported into India which ariseout of the Report of the Tariff Board recently received.    The Government of India have pressed me  for  a reply by the end of April.  as there is no fixture of a Cabinet Council between  the 15th. and 26th, it would appeardesirable that any questions which it  may be desired to raise in the Cabinet should,if possible, be raised next Tuesday.    I append the latest telegram on the subject  from the Government of India, and adraft of a telegram in reply, which has been drawn up by my Councilin  Committee,and which I have not yet personally revised.  The Council desire, if possible, to settlethis reply telegram at their meeting next Tuesday afternoon.                                                                   OLIVIER.    11th April 1924.                               MEMORANDUM.    Goods imported  into India are at present taxed for the  most part either at a15 per cent, rate (the general tariff rate) or at a 30 per cent,  rate  (&quot; luxury rate &quot;).On some articles  for special  reasons  there are  other  rates;  for instance, there is avery low rate on machinery and some raw materials.    The duty on most kinds of iron and steel goods is at  present on a 10 per cent.basis.    The Indian import  duties were originally imposed for purposes  of revenue andnot of protection.   They are still commonly spoken of as revenue duties, though fromthe comparatively high rates now reached,  and  from the discrimination  betweenclasses of goods stated above, it is clear that  there  is now a considerable element ofprotection in them,  though no scientific  principles of protection have so far been applied.    In 1921 the Government of India appointed a Fiscal Commission to advise them on their tariff policy. The recommendations of the Commission relevant to the present memorandum are  as foLlows :     &quot;1.     &quot; (a) That the Government of India  adopt a policy of protection to be  applied          with discrimination along the lines indicated in this Report.     &quot; (6) That discrimination be exercised in  the selection-of industries for protection,          and in the  degree of protection  afforded,  so  as to make the inevitable          burden on the community as light as is consistent with  the  due  develop-          ment of industries.     &quot; (c) That the  Tariff Board (see below) in dealing with claims for protection .          satisfy itself                &quot;  (i) that the industry possesses natural advantages ;               &quot; (ii) that without the help of protection it is not likely to develop at            all,  or not so rapidly as is desirable ;  and               &quot; (iii) that it will eventually be able to face world competition without            protection.     &quot; (d) That raw materials and machinery be ordinarily admitted free of duty, and          that semi-manufactured goods used in. Indian industries be taxed as          lightly as possible.     &quot; (e) That industries essential for purposes  of national defence,  and   for the          development of which conditions in India  are   not  unfavourable,  be           adequately protected if necessary.    &quot;2. That a permanent Tariff Board be created, whose duties will be,  inter alia,to investigate the  claims of particular industries to protection,  to watch the operationof the tariff,  and generally to advise Government and the Legislature  in  carrying outthe policy indicated above.&quot;     7255   125  4.24                                                      A
    Early in  1923 the Indian Legislative  Assembly  passed a resolution which, ineffect, approved the above recommendations.   This resolution was in terms proposedby the Government of India with, unimportant amendments.-    The Fiscal Commission  had recommended that the  question, of protecting the steel industry should be one of the first to be investigated by the Tariff Board. ^ the report  of the. Tariff Board on this  question has now been  submitted to the Govem-ment of  India (but  not  yet published).  The Report says: &quot; The  steel industrysatisfies  the three conditions which the Fiscal Commission considered should besatisfied in ordinary cases by all industries before a claim to protection is entertained&quot;It is also an essential industry for purposes  of  self-defence and  of great importance on  national grounds.  It, might,  therefore,  claim protection even  if  the ordinaryconditions were not  fully satisfied.&quot;  Kates  of  duty for many classes  of  steel goods(and for competing classes of iron goods) varying from about 20 per cent, to 28 percent,  are recommended.  Increased duties on varieties of steel and classes of goodsnot likely to be produced in India in the near future are not recommended.  Bountiesaxe recommended on rails and railway waggons  produced in India.   Owing to thepresent instability of conditions in the trade, the Tariff Board  recommend that thenew duties  should be established for three  years only and should be reconsideredduring the third year (1926-27).    The question is being treated as one of great urgency because the Tata Iron andSteel Company, the only company at present manufacturing steel in India, is not farfrom  disaster  under present conditions  (though  it has  recently passed  through aperiod of great prosperity and very high dividends).  A  special May  session of theIndian Legislature is therefore being called to deal with the matter.    The Tariff Board have received a considerable quantity of evidence unfavourable to the protection of the industry, largely from other industries using  steel goods andfrom champions of the consumer, but their proposals (which in the important cases ofrails and railway  waggons favour bounties, which  fall on the general  taxpayer andnot on the consumer) and their arguments in favour of them are very skilfully framedfor the purpose of disarming opposition, and it may be anticipated that their proposalswhen known will be generally welcomed in India.  ;    The  opponents  of the scheme have  made  much  of the fact  that its  immediatebenefits will all go to a single company  (the Tata Iron  and  Steel Company), which isthe only concern now manufacturing steel in India.  The Tariff Board have, however,had in  view throughout  the actual cost of making steel  in India, and  give strong reasons for believing that the need of protection is not due to mismanagement on thepart of  the Tata Company, but to the necessarily high cost of manufacturing steel inIndia under present conditions (although, as already stated, they  believe that the costs  will come down, and that India  will  eventually be able to manufacture steelwithout protection).    The. scheme is  held to  involve a burden of  about 1,000,OOOL  annually on theconsumer, but  this  would be  so widely distributed that no serious hardship to individuals  is anticipated.    An important feature of  the scheme is a proposal that &quot; If the Governor-general in Council  is  satisfied,  after such enquiry as he considers necessary, that steel  isentering India from  abroad at such prices as are likely to render the protection givenby this case ineffective, he  may impose such additional duties as in his judgment arerequired.&quot;  This  proposal as it stands carries the principle of  taxation by adminis-trative  order to an  extreme length, but  the  Government of India are apparentlyconsidering the question of  limiting the power so as to make it exerciseable  only within certain prescribed conditions (more or less on the line of anti-dumping ordersalready in force in the United Kingdom and other countries).    It will be remembered  that  since the passing of the Government of  India Act,1919, successive Secretaries of State for India have made pronouncements in favour oiwhat  is  known as the establishment of  a &quot; Fiscal Autonomy  Convention,&quot; which amount  to  saying that  they do  not  intend (except  possibly  on specific groundsirrelevant to the present  question)  ever to disallow  any  tariff measure favoured jointlyby the Government of India and  their Legislature.  In the present instance there is every reason to believe that  agreement&apos; between the Government  of&apos; India and theirLegislature  will be established and that it.would,  therefore, be contrary to the policyof the Reforms for the Secretary of State or. the British Government to. overrule them.    The proposals will of course be unwelcome  to British manufacturers of steel andsteel goods, and to  British traders in  these  commodities.   The &quot;total  imports  into
India from the United Kingdom of iron and.steel  and goods manufactured therefrom-amount at present to about 43,500,000L a year.  The amount oE this trade affected  bythe present proposals  is not more than  16,000,0001., and  may be substantially less,.and it is of course.not to be anticipated that the whole of this part  of the trade willbe  lost.  Moreover,  the development of steel  making is  necessarily  a very  slowprocess, and the effect on British industry for two  or three years to come may not  be&apos;very great.Telegram from Government of India, dated 28th March, and draft reply.  1. Telegram from Viceroy, Commerce Department, to Secretary of State for India,                             dated 28th March 1924.     Your telegram of  the  26th  instant, 975.   Tariff Board&apos;s Report on Steel.  Wehave now considered the Report in  detail, and  in this telegram  we  propose to reportto you own conclusions.   In examining the Report, we did not think it necessaryagain to raise the general  question  of  Free Trade versus Protection.   We think thatthis part of the subject is  correctly treated in Chapter 9 of  the first Report of lastyear.   With the  full concurrence, of the  Indian Legislature, we  gave our general-adherence to a policy of what may be called discriminating protection.   The questionswhich the  Tariff Board had to examine and  which we have  to  decide  are,  first,whether  the  steel  industry satisfies the conditions laid down in para.  97 of the fiscal Commissions Report, that is,  whether it is an industry which may legitimatelybe protected.   This question is answered in the affirmative in ChapterTl of the first report, and we accept the conclusion.  The second question is, whether protection isnecessary for the preservation and development of the industry, and here again we haveno difficulty in accepting the Tariff  Board&apos;s conclusion that,  at the present level of world  prices,  the manufacture  of  steel  in  India  is carried on at a  loss, andthat, unless protection is given, there is. no hope  that it will  develop for many years to come and serious danger  that it  may collapse altogether.  The  third question is,what measure  of protection will. be  adequate to the end in view.;  and  the fourth is,whether the   advantages  of. applying  that  measure  of  protection  outweigh the disadvantages. -It is  these  two last questions which  are  the crucial questions, andthe  greater part  of  the Tariff  Boards first  two Reports,  which  alone  are of immediate  importance, is, devoted to answering them.     2. The scheme of  protection  recommended by the Tariff  Board has been worked-out with great care.  We do not propose to set it  out in detail in this telegram, but will content ourselves with pointing out certain salient features.   In the first place,the Tariff Board has been careful so  to frame its proposals as to interfere as little aspossible  with  those kinds   of  steel  which are not  produced  in  India  at  presentand are  not likely to  be produced  in  India for  some time to  come.  This course is obviously  correct.   As  regards  the remaining  kinds .of steel, the  measure ofprotection  proposed is  the difference  between the  price  at which  steel  is likelyto be imported from  abroad  and  the price at which it can be manufactured; but.steel is a basic industry and the Tariff Board&apos;s proposals are far-reaching.  They dealfirstly with raw steel, that is, products produced by the Tata Iron and Steel Company.These products are now subject to an import duty of 10 per cent,  ad valorem.   TheTariff Board proposes the specific duties shown io para. 143, sub-rjara. 15, of first Report,plus, for special reasons, certain bounties on rails and fish-plates.   The  specific dutiesproposed represent,  on basis of present tariff  valuation, 20 per cent, on  structuralshapes and plates, and 28 per cent, on common steel bars and rods.  But products ofTata Iron and Steel Company are material for many other industries, which industriesprovide market for the basic industry ; therefore Board proposes  to raise the duty onfabricated  steel from  10 to 25 per  cent.   This  measure does not merely compensateengineering industries for  enhanced duties  on raw  steel-it  goes  further.  It  givesthem a measure of substantive protection (see para. 13 of the second Report).  Thereare also certain subsidiary  industries vitally affected, and bounties are proposed forwaggons and a certain measure for tin plates, wire nails and hoes, kodalies and. picksamong agricultural implements in  addition ; but, as  an integral part of  the abovescheme, certain exceptional powers are proposed in para. 36 of. the first Report to be conferred on  the  Governor-General in  Council.  This  proposal is  one of the,  most difficult parts  of the Report, and, for the moment, we exclude it from  consideration.We shall, deal  with it separately below.         ,             1 \
     3.  The Tariff-Board  lias  made a careful study of the  effect of its proposals &apos; not oirly. on our customs revenue,, but  also: op the general consumer in India.  Para  35 of Annexure B to the second. Report summarises its  conclusions&apos; On the point;  ,The- duties and&apos; bbuhties proposed will  be iii force&apos; only Jbr three years, when 1 ho whole question will be reconsidered, and the Report  tends to show&apos; that during those three years the effect on our revenue will be small.  The burden on the consumer is estimated at 164  lakhs, or just above  1,000,0001.  sterling a year.   It is  calculated that rather more than one-third of this amount will fall on the general consumer, about one-third on the Governments, public, bodies and railways, and  somewhat less than one-third on the industries.  This estimate is the best than can be made On the materials available and we accept it.   We note that particular care has been taken in the general interest of the  country  to  lighten  the  burden on  the railways as  much  as  possible.  The bounty proposed on rails, fish-plates  and waggons will be met from general revenues. The former  bounty will  be provided almost entirely from the  estimated increase in customs revenue, but that on waggons will be a charge on general revenues  in two- out of the three years for  which  the new  duties are proposed, but amount involved is small for the rest.   The estimated cost of the higher duties- on Railways is  dealt with in para. 130 of the first Report.   This estimate  is being investigated  by the Railway Board, and we will let you know their view as soon as possible.     4. We. have now to decide whether  we accept the scheme of protection proposed as adequate to the end in  view, and whether the balance of advantage lies in accepting that scheme.  Our general view on the former point is that, as  we have already said. the Tariff Board has worked out its  proposals with great care and  we are also of opinion that they have worked them out with studious moderation.  It  is true proposals are- far-reaching and that new duties proposed are themselves high ;  nevertheless we have some doubt whether they have not been cut dangerously fine.  The difficulties of the- Board arose from the fact that, while the real object in view is to create conditions in which a  healthy steel industry can be developed in India, yet from the nature of the-case they were compelled  to concentrate attention on the affairs of a single industry  see Chapter 7 of the first  Report.     On the whole  we consider  that they have held the  balance between these two considerations very fairly.  The immediate object is to preserve  the existing industry, and  para.  106 of the first Report  shows  that the Board has attempted to give that industry the minimum assistance  required  to tide it  over a difficult period.  Oh the other hand, in  its  calculations the Board has taken not the actual expenditure of the Tata  Iron  and Steel Company, but the expenditure which, in its judgment, anymanufacturer of iron and  steel on the same scale would have to incur.  This procedure-has involved the writing down of  the capital of  Tata  Iron and Steel  Company for the-purpose of arriving at a reasonable cost of producing steel in India.  This procedure is no doubt correct, and  it has  the  further advantage  that  the Tata Iron and Steel Company will still have  every inducement to  increase its  output and enforce every possible economy in order to  get  back to a dividend-earning basis, but, as we have said above, we do not disguise from  ourselves the fact that  the proposals of the Tariff&apos; Board have  been  cut  very fine indeed.  They will  certainly be  criticised by one section of opinion in India as being insufficient.     5. We shall have to  meet criticism  from European business opinion in  India if&quot; we accept the Tariff BoarcVs proposals.     We shall be accused  of laying a heavy burden on India, in order to bolster up a badly managed inefficient industry.  On this latter point the Tariff Board&apos;s Report is, to some extent, reassuring.  Clearly there have been  mistakes in the management of the Company, and we have  little doubt that greater extensions  were  planned on too ambitious a scale.   Also  the Gompany&apos;s  main difficulty at  present, namely, that  of-working capital, is due to lack of foresight (particularly in paying, two or three yearshack, too high dividends), combined with unwise dependence ou ordinary deposits for day  to day finance,  but  the  Tariff  Board&apos;s Report shows that the CompanyV difficulties are mainly due to a  combination  of untoward  circumstances.  They are in  the  most difficult  of  all periods for a growing  industry.  They have not yet attained their maximum output,  and have not  yet trained their labour fully, and this stage in their development coincides with  a period of fierce  competition amongst immensely powerful European concerns for markets.  Prices have been cut to the bone, and in some countries depreciated  exchanges have introduced a  further com- plication.  It is certain that without  assistance the Company must fail, and the mam object of the  Tariff Board&apos;s proposal is  to give it such assistance  as, with careful,.. efficient and economical management, will tide  it, over this difficult transition period. If this period is safely passed, Tariff  Board hold that there  is a  reasonable  assurance
that at no very remote date Indian steel will  be able tq hold its own in  competition&quot;with&apos; imported steel without protection.                  .    \       &apos;        &apos;  .&quot;    6. But there are other considerations which have to  betaken into account;  someof them are briefly stated in para. 142 pf the first Report.   We would add  that it isimpossible to decide issue at stake purely on economic grounds.  We have endeavoured:to summarise the- economic arguments for and against the Tariff BoarcVs proposalsfairly in  the preceding paragraph,  but we must also take into consideration  theimmensely strong  sentiment in favour  of  protection of the steel in/lustry which jg.almost universal amongst educated Indians.  Tata Iron and Steel Company is regardedas a great industry of vital national importance, which has been brought to its present stage by Indian  enterprise and under Indian direction, and deep feelings pf nationalpride and national sentiment are involved in the preservation and development&apos;of that industry.   Its failure, apart from giving a disastrous set-back to development, wpuMbe regarded  on  other grounds as a national calamity, and  if that failure followed&apos;^refusal on our part to give assistance which Tariff Board has reported  tq be necessary and desirable, it would  be laid at our door.  We should be accused of subqrdinating-tbe interests of  India to the  interests  of  the  British manufacturer.  We must aigqhear  in mind importance in Imperial interests  of  the existence  of  a living step!industry in the event of war.     7. After careful consideration, therefore, of the  problem in all its bearings, weare satisfied that  the right course is  to  accept  the scale  of  protective duties  andbounties proposed by Tariff Board.  We shall examine further  the actual duties  andbounties proposed and  reserve  the  right  to alter them in  detail. . If we make  any alterations we shall immediately let  you know;  in the meantime you may proceed onthe assumption that we accept the scale of  duties and bounties proposed.&apos;     8. We now come back  to the proposal in para. 36 of  the  first Report regardingwhat we may conveniently call the  offsetting duties.  We note from para. 4 of yourtelegram of the  25th  instant that you are  inclined to view this proposal with strong objection,  and  we have no  hesitation  in saying  that our first impressions were-precisely the same;  we see clearly  all the objections that  may be  taken  to theproposal.  We do not think it necessary to elaborate all these objections, but we will mention briefly  most important of them.  In the first place,  the proposal will  be very difficult  to  work.   Para. 45  of the first Report  explains the method by which the Tariff Board arrived at its estimate of the prices  at which the  different kinds of  raw steel entered India in the latter half of  1923.  Para.  36  explains hqw prices should be dptermined  for the purpose of deciding whether  the offsetting ditties  should be imposed.          ,      ; -     It will  be  seen that the two  methods differ.   The  fprmer prices again were weighed  prices, and we should have  no  means  of ascertaining  what  drop  in the price, say, of continental bar steel would  justify imposition pf  an offsetting duty ($ee m this connection para. 47 of first  Report).  Again,  invoice prices, as experience in- other countries shows,  are  a very unsafe guide to the real import  prices.   The proposal, again, is objectionable in that it tends  to deprive the Tata Iron and Steel Company of that  stimulus  to economical efficient   production  which  the  whole protection scheme is intended to provide.  A further objection  is that we shall be subjected to constant pressure (on the plea that steel is being  imported at dumping prices) to impose offsetting duties and  so to increase protection for the Tata Iron and Steel Company.   Finally, in  principle, we do  not like  the  proposal that we should have power to put on or take off duties without recourse to the Legislature.      9. We  fully  realise the force of all these objections.   On the other hand, these offsetting duties  are an integral part of the Tariff Board/s scheme.  The essence of that scheme is  to bridge the gap between the prices at which steel can be made in India and  the  price at  which it  can  be imported, and, as we have said  above, the proposals have  been cut very fine.  Many  speculative elements inevitably  enter  into the calculation  of import prices in the present unstable conditions of exchanges, and we cannot disguise from ourselves  fact that if we  do not take this power, circum- stances may arise  in  the near future  which  will render ineffective measure of protection  which we think  it necessary  to give \to the steel industry.  We are also impressed by the fact  that countries which have embarked on a policy  of protection have almqst without exception been compelled to resort  to expedients of this kind. Indeed, Tariff  Board&apos;s  actual, proposal is largely modelled on U.S.A. precedent, and       7255        &apos;                              &apos;                           B
we would also refer to the  anti-dumping legislation of -Australia, New Zealand, South&apos;Africa, Japan and  many other countries. -  Thus we are in. a dilemma.   On&apos;the onehand, we see all the objections to the Tariff Board&apos;s proposal; on the other hand, wemust regard it  as  an integral part of the comprehensive scheme put up to us- by&apos; theBoard.   And after giving our best consideration to an extremely difficult problem, wehave arrived at the conclusion that the best  solution is the following.     10.  It will be observed from para. 37 of the first Report that the  Board contem-plates that the power to impose offsetting duties should  be capable of exercise in thecase of  imports from  all countries, or  from a  particular  country, or from particular countries, and we have no  doubt that if we do have to make use of the power at all we shall make use of it in respect  of imports  from continental countries.   We aredoubtful, however, whether we could put on au  offsetting duty against France withoutinfringing  our  commercial  treaty  with  France, unless, at.   the same time, weimposed it against  all foreign countries.   Again, we could not effectively imposeit against Belgium  unless we also imposed  it against France.  It would he tooeasy  to  evade.   Difficulties of this  kind would be  removed if we could substitute for  the  offsetting  duties  a two-decker tariff  on  raw  steel, steel from the UnitedKingdom being subject to duties proposed by the Tariff Board and steel from  all othercountries being subjected to  a higher  scale of duties.  The Chief objection to thiscourse is that, at first, at any rate, it imposes on lthe consumer a heavier burden thanthe  Tariff Board proposes.  Moreover, Indian  Legislature would not in its presenttemper  welcome any measure of Imperial Preference, and would resent any attempt on our part to force it on them, nor. could we be a party to forcing it on them against their will;  it would be a mistake of tactics, and would  damage cause  of  imperial preference  irretrievably.  At the same time,   while we propose to  take power toimpose  offsetting duties in the Bill, we propose, in  introducing the Bill, to explainfully all the difficulties in the way of  offsetting duties, and to refer the Bill to  a select Committee.  In Select Committee we shall do all  we can to get the Committeeto  propose that  offsetting  duties should . be. dropped,  and that instead  we shoulddiscriminate in our  duties between  imports of  steel  from the United Kingdom and imports  from foreign countries.   Even if final  decision is in favour of offsettingduties, there is this advantage in them that almost inevitably they will operate iu theend in  favour  of imports from  the United Kingdom as against imports from theContinent.                 -   -   -                         .-     11.  It will be observed that we  propose in the Bill to  take  the powers advocated by the Tariff Board.  That power will be&apos;a wide and elastic power, not only to impose,hut also to  take  off, offsetting duties, but we  shall make  our  position very plain inthe debates on the Bill.  The power will be exercised only in case of  necessity when we are satisfied that the need is real and urgent.  Save in the most exceptional cases,moreover, the  power will  not be exercised except after  public and careful investi-gation,  usually by the Tariff Board, and  finally  wherever feasible we shall  consult theLegislature before taking action.I  ..  12. We accept the. proposal of the Tariff Board that, while in any Bill we mayintroduce we should, announce that  it is, our policy to  protect  the steel industry, the^precise duties proposed should be in force only for three years,  and that before theyare reimposed the whole question should again be investigated.  New capital wouldbe more readily. attracted to  the industry if  the  term of the  new duties  were not&quot;restricted to. three  years,-but in face of the Tariff Boarcfs recommendation we mustlimit the term  and we can only hope that announcement of the. policy will  serve thepurpose for which it is intended.     13. Point taken in para. 3 of your telegram is one of great difficulty.  AVe are most anxious to give due notice  of  our intentions and to give full opportunity to all,.interested  for  discussion  and representation.   On the  other hand, we should be,reluctant  to publish, the Report  unless  simultaneously  or  almost  immediatelyafterwards we could publish our conclusions.    If  we publish the Report  and  do notalmost  at  once  say what action we propose  to  take,  we shall leave the  trade in.a  most undesirable  state of  uncertainty.   We desire,  therefore,  to  publish the Report about four weeks, or a  little  earlier  if possible, before the special session&apos;. meets  on  27th. May..  We have, already, received  complaints from, the Associated Chambers  of Commerce that we ought to publish the Report at Once.   We cannot do this, for the reasons1 we have explained, but  you will understand what  importance&quot; we attach to publication before the end of April, and&apos;we- hope that you  will let us have your observations with the  least possible  delay.   We greatly regret  giving you
so little time, but&apos; we are. confident that you will realise the extreme  difficulty of. o.ur.position.

I desire to express at once  my  highappreciation of extremely valuable report of  Tariff Board and my agreement with you in accepting their view that according to criteria laid down  in Fiscal Commission^Report steel industry is  one that may properly receive  protection.  1 also agree thatmethods on which Tariff Board have proceeded in calculating what duties are required on various descriptions of goods are entirely sound  but as I have not had before me the materials for checking  detailed  figures of cost on  production, price of imported goods,  &amp;c,  on  which  they have based their calculations  of duties and  bountiesappropriate to various classes of goods, I cannot express definite opinion on these but must leave it to  your Government to scrutinise these figures carefully and modify theduties or bounties in any cases in which you  cannot  accept figures on which  theyare based.     2.  In para  4. of your  telegram  you remark that procedure adopted by tariff board has  involved  writing down  capital of Tata Iron and  Steel Company for purpose of  arriving at reasonable cost of producing  steel  in India.  I  agree  with you that as value of  works is less than capital expenditure account writing clown isnecessary.  But  further, since  nominal capital  account as  exhibited in  para.  78exceeds.15 crores adopted for estimating return on investment, it would  appear that apart from unforeseen developments, holders of ordinary and deferred shares will not receive normal  dividends if  nominal capitalisation is left  as at present.  This willprovide a lever for Company in future years to press for  protection to be maintained at a rate sufficient to  produce  normal dividends on the  admittedly inflated capital.I think it very desirable therefore to  bring  all possible pressure to bear on Tata&apos;s to promise early reconstruction  on basis  of  lower capital value.  This  would  have further advantage of securing admission by  Tata&apos;s that Tariff Board&apos;s calculations arecorrect in substance and that  they are in fact over capitalised.   It might be put toTata&apos;s that whole object of  scheme&apos; which is to develop steel industry will be greatlyfurthered by such reconstruction as  this, which will help them,  to  raise  new capital when, needed in future.     3.  As regards proposal of Tariff Board  that your Government should take power . to impose  offsetting duties, I should he well satisfied if discussions arising out of this proposal could be made to result in institution of two  rates of duty, lower for goods from  United Kingdom  and  higher  for goods from all other countries.  Is  it your intention that lower rate should be rate  recommended by  Tariff Board ?  At  the same time  I  cannot conceal my doubts  of  success of your proposed manoeuvres to attain  this  object, and matter would  need delicate handling  as  future prospects of Imperial Preference might  be damaged  if negotiations with Select Committee should be too conspicuously unsuccessful.     4. But even if two-decker  tariff  should  be accepted it might still prove necessary to impose higher duties as result of experience, and it would still be arguable that your Government should have  power to impose offsetting  duties.    If you found it necessary in last resort to accept proposal to take this power, I should be prepared to &quot;withdraw  my  objections, but it is  ia my  opinion clear  that absolutely unfettered power  over tariff rates  should not  pass to Executive Government  and  permissible - increase should, I think, be limited to 25 per cent, of rate  imposed by Legislature.     5. I note your assurance  that this power would be exercised only in case of necessity when  you  are  satisfied of reality and urgency of  need, that save in most exceptional  cases it would only be  exercised  after public and careful investigation usually by  Tariff Board  and,  finally, that  wherever feasible  you would consult Legislature before taking action.  I attach utmost importance to these points.  I also think  that in  legislation  contemplated  your Government should  take power to require manufacturers to give relevant information regarding their business and to produce books if called for.      6. I accept proposals, in para. 12 of your telegram regarding three-year period. ,:      7.  I agree with you in wishing to have report published before  end of month. /.;&apos;   8.
