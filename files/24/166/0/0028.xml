Government of  India Bill.                 MEMORANDUM.    Section 87 of the Government of India Act, whichdates from 1793, provides that &quot; if the Governor-General&quot; or a  governor  or  the Commander-in-Chief  of  His&quot; Majesty&apos;s forces in India......departs from&quot; India, intending to return to Europe, his  office shall&quot; thereupon become vacant.&quot;  The result  of this provi-sion is that to none of  these high officials can leave  ofabsence  be granted to enable them to visit this country during their term of office, and the effect of the amend-ments made in the Act by the  Government of india act, 1919, is to extend this disability to six  officials who were previously lieutenant-governors or  chief com-missioners and are now governors.    It is proposed  by this Bill  to repeal this provision and to  give power to the Secretary of  State in Councilto grant leave to these officials.  The Bill  also providesfor  the  appointment of persons to take  the place  ofa governor-general, commander-in-chief and  governorsgranted  leave and for other consequential arrangements.    It also, consequentially, makes statutory the methodof appointing a  permanent  commander-in-chief whichhas  been followed for many years.94-2a
