             XOTE BI THE MlNISTBB OF HEALTH.  The  attached  report is  circulated  for the  information ofParliament.  It should be understood  that the report has beensubmitted  in response  to a, request  made  on  behalf  of theGovernment to. representatives of the employers and  workersin the building industry  and of the manufacturers of  building materials that they should assist the Government by advice asto what  the  industry itself consider can be  done in the way of producing  working  class houses.  The  report  is  under theconsideration&apos; of the Government  with other matters  relatingto housing.                              (Signed)    JOHN WHEATLEI.To  the  Et.  Hon.  JOHN WHEATLEY,  M.P., Minister of Health;    Et. Hon.  THOMAS SHAW,  M.P., Minister of Labourand the    Et. Lion. WM.  ADAMSON, M.P., Secretary for  Scotland.SIRS,  .  WE have, at  your request, carefully considered the present general  position  in  the  Building  Industry,  with particular reference to an extension of the present housing programme, asproposed by the Government.  In  order  to examine the morethoroughly all the various problems presented, a Committee was formed  representative  of  Employers and  Operatives  in  all branches of the Building Trade.   This Committee has met con-tinuously since the consideration  of the  matter was desired by you, and, for the  purposes  of closer investigation into all  thecircumstances, conferences have taken place with the representstives of manufacturers of building materials both in England andin Scotland.  The question before the Committee has  presented many diffi-culties, but every effort has been made to inquire closely into all aspects of the  problems involved.   One issue, however,  we find it necessary to particularise, viz., the question of the payment for  lost time.   The representatives  of the  National Federationof Building Trade Employers realise that  the Prime Ministerand the Minister of Health have already considered the matter,and have said that the question was one  in the  first place  for settlement  by  the  Industry.  The  Operatives&apos;  Side, however,feel strongly on this question,  and  if the results  of the jointinquiry now to be made by the Industry  are  not satisfactory,the representatives of the operatives ask that, when the StatutoryCommittee is  established under the  new Housing Act,  it shallhave power to inquire and deal with  the point raised.
340  It will be found in the Report of the Committee that reeom-raendations have been made for an early commencement of housebuilding, with a continuous and  enhanced programme covering a number of years.  The  Committee have endeavoured to makemany suggestions which it  is hoped will prove of  assistance tothe Government,  and,  as a result of  very close attention and consideration  of all the points which  have arisen in the courseof the discussions, it is felt that  the Committee can give everyassurance that,  with the certainty  of  a  guaranteed programme for a number of years, there is no reason why, with the goodwill of all parties concerned, the housing needs of the country shouldnot be successfully met.  We have the honour, herewith, to submit the Report of  theCommittee, and in submitting the  Report we  desire to expressour appreciation of the  action of the Government in consulting the Industry in this important  question.  ,We have endeavoured to merit the trust shown us, and beg to assure you that in everyway possible you may rely upon our utmost assistance.  In conclusion, we desire to  pay testimony  to the value of  theservices  rendered to the Committee throughout its labours bythe  Secretary, Mr. B. H. Rogers (Ministry of Labour).  these have been greatly appreciated.                We are,  Sirs,                     Yours faithfully,                    (Signed) WILLIAM  H.

COPPOCK, Secretary, National Federation of Building        Trade Operatives.Secretary to the  Committee :     Mr. B. H. ROGEES, Ministry of Labour.  At the first meeting of the Committee on 18th February, 1924,the general aspects of the position were  reviewed, and it wasdecided that,  in  view of the limited time  at  the  disposalof the Committee, and of the amount of work involved, certainsub-committees should be entrusted with the detailed considera-tiion of special sections  of  the work.   Four  sub-committees were accordingly formed.   These were : The General PurposesSub-Committee;   the Materials Supply  Sub-Committee;  theLabour Supply  Sub-Committee;  and the  Scottish  Sub-Com-mittee. The personnel of these sub-committees was as follows :-        Employers&apos;                   Operatives&apos;      Representatives.               Representatives.Mr. W. COLES.Mr. WM. CROSSMr. G.

Meetings of the full Committee&apos; and  of  the  various  Sub-Committees  were  held  from day  to day.  (Meetings  also tookplace with representatives of Building Material Manufacturers.The Scottish Sub-Committee also  made a detailed inspection ofcertain Scottish Housing  Schemes with a view to a comparison of costs with English types of Housing Schemes.  To the General  Purposes Committee fell the consideration ofthe wider  questions connected with the  problem of Housing.Questions as to length and size of the programme; the  difficultiesin actual operation of the Scheme; the  analysis  of costs, andgeneral matters affecting Housing Schemes  and  contracts for private work. .  It was agreed that the views of  the  general purposes Committee should be put forward in the following form.The Reports of the other Sub-Committees follow in. their order.1701CA 4j
general.The previous experience of the Industry, the present difficulty    and its solution.  The previous experience of  the  Building Trade in regard toGovernment Housing Schemes has not been of a nature to inspire confidence in the industry.  It  should  be said,  however, thaiprevious   schemes were launched  under circumstances  of an unfavourable nature.  Some of those difficulties have ceased to  operate but one ofthem,  the relative shortage of skilled labour in, the Industry,still operates.   Another difficulty was the high cost of producinghouses, that has been favourably modified to  a large  extent, butthe present day cost is such that  working-class houses cannot beproduced  on  an economically  satisfactory basis,  such as  wouldinduce the investment of capital, unless  a subsidy is provided bythe State.  Experience has shown that the subsidy granted underthe 1923  Act is insufficient, to produce  the class of workmen&apos;scottages required, because  their rentals are beyond the means ofthe class for which such cottages are most urgently needed.  It is in these circumstances that the  Minister  of Health, theMinister of Labour, and the Secretary for Scotland, on behalf ofthe Government, have invited the Building Industry  (Employersand Operatives), the Manufacturers of Building Materials and theLocal Authorities, to study the problem as it now presents itself,and to make  such proposals as they may deem suitable to enablethe housing shortage to be overcome.  The following is the report of the Building Industry in response to the Ministers request.  This action  on   the   part  of  the   G-overnment is highlyappreciated by the Building Industry, and the organisations ofthe Employers and  Operatives have heartily concurred and co-operated in an endeavour  to give the Ministers the  best  advice in their power.  The intimation which the Ministers gave at the outset,  that  the Government  was prepared   to  consider  a programme extending over  a  period of  years has provided theessential  factor  enabling the  Industry  to contemplate  the substantial  additions to the skilled  personnel of the industry which will be found hereinafter set out.  The causes of the  depletion in the numbers of skilled craftsmenin the Building Industry are not far to  seek.  They may be shortly indicated thus :- .     (1) The casual nature of employment, partly  due to seasonal           causes, partly to irregularity  of demand for  building           work.     (2) The drafts which other industries make upon the Labour           Supply of  our Industry  for  the  purposes of those           Industries  e.g., maintenance staffs in large works,           requirements  in  Shipbuilding,  Cabinet  Making,           Wagon Building and the  like.
             -            v:  9):   &apos; &quot;  :  &apos;      &quot;:    (3) The prolonged depression in our Industry which  existed          from about 1905-6 onwards until 1914.    (4) The loss of personnel due  to.  the war,  post: war,  time          conditions and also to emigration.  The  effects  of  causes 1, 3  and 4 upon the  recruiting ofapprentice labour have been deplorable on account of the  want of confidence engendered  thereby.  The Committee therefore considers that it is primarily necessaryto restore  the confidence  of both  Employers and  Workmen inthe future of the Industry, by providing  the most stabilised con-ditious possible in regard  to the  demand  for building work  for a prolonged  period.   Having regard to the arrears of building of ageneral character, and to  the vast arrears of house  building, theCommittee feels that the  present juncture is a favourable  one forsecuring that needful stabilisation of demand.  The Committee,therefore,  recommends that  the  further housing proposals of theGovernment  should  be   based upon  a  definite  continuousprogramme of 15 years.  Erom  information supplied  it is  understood that under the1923 Act there are  about  40,000 houses being built  per year, andthe  Committee suggests that the new proposals should  providefor  a further 50,000 to be  built the  first  year, increasing  by further increments of houses per year until an extended maxi-mum of 225,000 houses a year  are reached, and maintained atthat level until towards the end of the 15  years&apos; programme.  The attention of the Committee  has been, called to.  certain types of unit  standard houses, now being constructed under theHousing Act, containing  floor  areas of  659 and 690 square feet.The Committee takes the strongest possible exception to suchtypes being constructed to-day.  &apos;The Committee objects princi-pally to the adverse influences  of such  limited  accommodationupon  those living  in  the houses.   The  restricted  floor  area ismoveover relatively more costly than the larger floor  areas.  Theremay  be occasional applications  for such types but the  generaldemand is not great, and as the cost is proportionately higher, itisconsidered  that  no houses  of  this  construction  should  be sanctioned unless under exceptional circumstances.  The Committee has given careful consideration to cost and asa result  of  careful  examination,  is  of  opinion   that  houses are  being  built  to-day  at  the lowest  possible  cost.   In  itsjudgment, taking the costs of labour and material as current onMarch 1st last, houses from 850 to 9.50  feet, super of containedarea, based  upon  the  Schedule as supplied  by the,  Ministryof Health, should,  under normal circumstances, not exceed in cost from x to y per square foot.*   The  cheaper  price being for.the larger area.   This includes the house,  paths,  fences,  and  * *n4 y indicate information conveyed confidentially to the Ministry oil,Uh.470-16                                                 A 5
house  drains,  but - no-sewers, street  pavings, roads or land.The specification being not below the Ministry Standard which,in the opinion of the Committee, is the mfnimum to be desired.The need lor guarantees as to continuity of programme and their    nature.  At the present time  the  existing  skilled  personnel  of  theIndustry is in most  sections of the trade fully occupied withthe current demand for building work, indeed there is evidenta pronounced  shortage of labour in  certain sections.    It is not,however, to be inferred  that  by limiting the current demand asufficient amount of suitable labour  would be released and madetransferable to house building, or that the supplying of materials would thereby be  rendered easy, the fact  being that the labourand much of the material used in ordinary commercial building is unsuitable  for  house building  and  could  not readily be sodiverted.  The Committee is definitely of the opinion that inthe interests of the community there should be no restriction on private or commercial work, the continuance of which is necessaryin order to employ large numbers of craftsmen who would other-wise be  unemployed,  and  such restriction  could not facilitatehousing production.  It will  be recognised  that  the process of depletion of labour which has taken place under  the influences cited above has  notbeen carried out without much inconvenience, and even hardship,accruing to individual workmen and employers, because such an  jexclusion of men only happens under the stress of unemployment,  Ior on account of a pronounced demand for their services else-where, with accompanying advantages  sufficient to induce them  jto forsake the trade in which they  have been brought up.  It is not surprising, therefore, that the organised workers view with apprehension the prospect of increasing the skilled personnel of the  Industry, and feel that they must have the completestassurances possible that such an increase will be satisfactorilyabsorbed, and that future demands for their services will be main-tained&apos;at an adequate level.  The Committee is unanimously of opinion that the demand forsuch assurances is a reasonable one,  and recommends that Parlia-ment should be asked to  sanction the expenditure  required fora. definite and continuous programme extending over 15 years forthe  erection  of  an  inclusive  total of up to, approximately,2,500,000 house upon a basis of cost to  be agreed.Provision for a National House Building  Committee, its status    and composition.  The  success of a Housing  Scheme of the kind indicated  will involve,  and will depend  upon, the hearty co-operation of  thevarious  parties concerned.  These will be the Building  Trades&apos; Employers and Operatives,the Manufacturers and the Local Authorities represented by theirrespective organisations,  with, behind  them, the  Government,
as representing the Nation, which will have to provide the finan-cial support  required to enable the proposed programme to becarried out.  There will be much to arrange and to co-ordmate. The LocalAuthorities will have to make their housing needs and intentionsknown to the Government,  to  the Industry,  and the Manu-facturers, as  far ahead as possible, so that the output of materialsmay be increased as and where necessary; their transport providedfor, the recruitment and training  of  the necessary labour  setgoing and directed to the proper localities,  and the  necessary financial commitments arranged for. The Committee, therefore,recommends  that provision should be made, in the legislative pro-posals which  may be required for the proposed Housing Scheme,for  the setting up  of  a National  House Building Committee(subsequently  referred  to as ,the  Statutory  Committee),  com-prised of  representatives of the  organisations referred to underthe Chairmanship of a member of the  Building Industry.  Sucha Committee to be given a  status, and a  permanency, whichwould enable it to deal  with everything arising  within the  In-dustry connected with  the exercise of its functions under  theHousing Scheme, and to have its expenses paid out of funds tobe provided  by Parliament.  The Statutory  Committee  so  set up   should  be   given power  to  obtain any  information which it deems  necessary from Housing Contractors and others.  Its proceedings should begiven the requisite amount of publicity to ensure the maintenanceof Public  Confidence.  It should be consulted in regard to  theconsideration of  design as effecting economy of construction, asto the method of obtaining  competitive tenders  and of placingcontracts, also as to the method of ensuring prompt settlementof accounts.  This last item is one of considerable importance because therehas been much and, it is believed,, undue delay, in obtaining thesettlement of housing accounts under previous housing schemes.  It is the  opinion of  this  Committee that the  best way ofobtaining  an adequate  supply of labour for the  new  housing scheme, especially in the earlier stages while the incoming appren-tices are being trained,  will be  to  spread the housing  contractsover the largest possible numbers of employers.  This will involvethe placing  of contracts to  suit the  capacities  of the smalleremployers.  The Committee feels that the  success of  the scheme depends upon enlisting the enthusiastic support of every  kind of privateenterprise,  so  that  employers  will  eagerly  strive to partici-pate in house-building,  and in the training of the  additional labour which is an essential condition of success.  It, therefore, recommends that every procedure should be sim- plified as  far as  possible to  that. end.  At  the  same  time  theGovernment should be empowered to prevent the  voluntary effort which is  an  essential feature of  these proposals, from  being weakened or defeated by indifference, hostility, or ignorant opposi- non from  whatsoever quarter proceeding.
LABOUB SUPPLY.  Attention has been given to the questions of labour supply underthe following headings :-    (1) Supply of labour at present available for commercial work           and housing work.    (2) Estimated shortage of1 labour, having regard to the pro-           posed housing programme.    (3) Suggested means whereby an adequate supply of labour           may be  available sufficient to guarantee the carrying           out in full of the proposed housing programme.The present state oi labour supply.  The figures supplied by the  Ministry  of Labour, representingthe number of insured persons, indicate  that, at  the  dates men-tioned, there were in each trade the following number of work-men 	December, 1913.	October, 1921.	January, 1921.Carpenters ...... Bricklayers ...... Masons ......... Slaters ......... Plasterers ... ...... Painters ......... Plumbers ... ...... Totals	126,780 68,920 38,870 6,650 20,180 130,860 36,860	132,260 62,170 23,880 5,370 17,080 115,900 35,840	125,010 57,170 22,270 5,210 16,070 106,860 34,440	429,120	392,500	367,030  The figures for&apos; January, 1924, show that there were less work-men at that time than in December, 1913, in the various crafts asfollows : CarpentersBricklayersMasonsSlatersPlasterersPaintersPlumbers 1,77011,75016,600 1,440 4,11024,000 2,4-20   (It should be noted, however,  that  the figures given above include  a considerable number of workmen  of: building trade occupations employed in connection with  other trades,  and the figures are, therefore, only quoted as providing a rough  genera!. indication father than as a definite statement.  We believe that this has been the case more so in recent years.   .   These figures ,plainly show that, speaking comparatively, there is a distinct shortage in bricklayers, masons and plasterers.  The figures in  regard  to painters may be  ignored for the  present purposes.
  The  Committee is of opinion that the  practical experienceof the trade is in accord with the position disclosed by the figures.There is, however, a general feeling that as soon  as  the  ship-building, and other industries employing  large quotas of joiners&apos;and plumbers&apos; labour,  become active again, there  will become evident a pronounced shortage of carpenters and joiners, and also of plumbers, it being notorious that the building industry is thenursery from which  those  classes of labour are drawn into anumber of other  industries, including cabinet making, carnageand car building.  It must also be  borne  in mind in consideringthe  total personnel of  the  industry that the  hours worked&apos; in1914 were considerably longer than  the  normal working  hoursof the present day.The programme of houses to  be built over  a series  of years and    the number of additional men required in each class.  In view of the desire  expressed by the Minister of Health,that  the programme envisaged  for the  first year should  be as large  as  possible,   say,   for  example,  125,000  houses   aseries  of  figures  has - been   prepared  by   the  Chairmanof the  Committee  for the  consideration of  the  Committee,and  is  given in  the  Appendix  (A).    In   the  opinion  ofthe  Committee the  figures  have  not  been  shaken  by  suchcriticism and comparison  of  information obtained  from other sources, as has been  available to the  Committee.   studying the  question at close quarters, however,  the Sub-Committee on labour Supply has come to the conclusion that for the first year50,000   additional houses  is  the  maximum  number  possible under most favourable circumstances.   Upon the assumptionthat  private enterprise  and  Eocal  Authority  schemes  areproducing 40,000  houses per year, the added production re-quired to yield a total of 125,000 houses a year at a period wouldbe 85,000.  About 57,230 craftsmen,  it is  estimated, would berequired for work on the additional 85,000 houses.  The  Committee does not think it possible  to  withdraw that number of men from the existing  personnel of the industry, andto transfer  them  to  housing,  having regard to the  present stateof demand for craftsmen&apos;s labour in the industry.  It is recog-nised,  however, that there  is no other  available  source  fromwhich  to draw them.  The  Committee  therefore  recommends that  the maximum programme  for the first year should be  anadded production of 50,000 houses.  This would reduce the numberof men required for; the added production of houses to 58-8 percent, (say 60 per cent.) of the number required for the productionof an additional 85,000 houses,  and the  numbers given on thefirst page of Appendix (A) would be approximately :-      Bricklayers      ............    11,772      Carpenters and joiners   ...     ......      7,848      Slater, tiler and plasterers   ......      7,848      Masons, painters, plumbers, gaafitters ...      6,870      Labourers  ...............     25,50059,838
  In considering these figures, regard must be given to the effi-ciency standard of augmented labour, as compared with standardcraftsmen and the necessary adjustment made by the admittingof the necessary number at the  commencement.  The Committee has given careful consideration to the question as to the means whereby that number of men can. be brought tobear upon housing production.  It must be borne in mind that,as compared with the other classes of building work, housing isnot the most attractive class of work to building trade craftsmen.It must also be recognised that employers will not willingly part with  workmen already in their employment, nor will workmenreadily leave their present employers.  It is further pointed outthat  employers  will not  cripple  their productive power  byparting with  the men they have gathered  about  them as theresult of, prolonged  selection.     The Committee - are thereforefirmly of opinion that to attempt to allocate housing contracts to employers who, in order to man them, would require to attractextra labour to themselves, which extra labour could only beobtained under present  circumstances  at the expense of other employers, would be a course of action which would be resentedby  the  employers   whose  labour personnel was to  be  thusdepleted.  No  doubt such employers would,  in self-defence, do their  best to retain  their men.   This might  lead, at times, toovermanning of their contracts in order to do  so,  and also tothe offering  of counter inducements,  The Committee has therefore come to the conclusion that thebest way to secure  the  transfer of the requisite  labour, on towork  in  connection  with van extended housing programme,  willbe to distribute the contracts, spread over the largest numberof employers possible, preferably to those already located in the districts in which houses are to be erected, and that every oppor-tunity should be given to the smaller types of employers to under-take housing contracts by making  the contracts small enough.The Committee desires to lay the greatest stress on this recom-mendation,  believing  that its  adoption and observance  is  asine qua non for  the successful launching and prosecution of thehousing proposals.The augmentation of labour required to supply the present needs    of the Industry.  Hitherto the augmentation of labour in the building industry has  been left  in the hands  of  individual  employers  in  eachlocality,  assisted at times by the operatives acting with theemployers on local joint  apprenticeship committees.  Local agreements  between operatives a,nd employers generallyexist, providing the upper limit  of  age (usually  16) at whichapprentices may be taken; that they must be indentured, and thatthey must not exceed a certain number in relation to the average number of  craftsmen employed by the individual employer whodesires to take  apprentices (usually the proportions vary between1 in 4 to 1 in 7); sometimes a maximum total number for any one
employer is imposed (ia the case of Manchester and London it is8).  For a long time past the  Employers&apos; Federation, with theapproval of the Operatives&apos; Federation, has urged upon its mem-bers the need that the employers should take the fullest number of apprentices allowable under the rules, but the request, while ithas in many cases been  complied with, has,  on the whole, not met with an adequate response ; as may be inferred from the factthat the census figures of 1921 showed that there were then intraining only about 21,000 apprentices  for the crafts of  brick-layers, masons,  carpenters and joiners,  slaters  and  plasterers,whereas if an average of 1 in 4 be applied to the figures given atthe beginning of this report it will be seen that upwards of 56,400apprentices should be in training in  those same five trades.  It will be readily inferred from what has been stated above thatthe National organisations of employers and operatives concernedcan, in the present circumstances, only use moral suasion  in thedirection of speeding up  the augmentation of the labour supplyunder the present local autonomy arrangements.  The NationalFederation of  Building  Trade Employers  and  the NationalFederation of Building Trade  Operatives, however, have  recog-nised  the necessity for using all possible influence to ensure anadequate number of apprentices being taken by employers, andhave recently appointed  a National Joint Apprenticeship Com-mittee to examine  the situation  and propose measures for itsamelioration.  The  Committee strongly recommends that thework of that National Joint Apprenticeship Committee should be expedited and that among its proposals should be found provisions for establishing joint apprenticeship  Committees of employers andoperatives in every locality where both sides are organised, whosemission it should  be to stimulate,  in every possible way,  the engagement of apprentices up to thermit provided by the existingworking rule agreements, together  with the removal, for  a time at least, of the restrictions as to the number of apprentices which any one employer  may  have, so  long as the total  number of apprentices  in a given district, when compared  with  the totalnumber of craftsmen of any trade concerned who are employed inthe district, does not exceed the ratio prescribed by the existingrules.   The registration of every  apprentice  is  also required.The further augmentation required for  the  additional housing    programme  and the method and means for such  augmen-    tation.   The Committee  proposes that,  in addition to what has been recommended above, it should be made a condition of every con-tract  for houses under this  scheme that the contractor shallemploy upon the work,  under such contract, apprentices up. toa total ratio of one [apprentice to three craftsmen, in each of thefollowing trades, viz., bricklayers  and  masons, carpenters andjoiners, slaters and  tilers, plasterers,  and plumbers.   (This doesnot mean one to three of the men on the contract,  but  in  thetrade in the district.)  Such apprentices to be indentured under an approved form of indenture in such a manner tha.t they shall
be under the supervision of a local joint committee of employersand  operatives,  and shall be  transferable by  that committeewherever  possible,  should  the contractor discontinue housingwork,  and  also  in  order  to secure  continuity  of  training andemployment.   Such apprentices to be similarly registered.  TheCommittee  recognises  that part  of the  difficulty  at  presentapprehended in launching  the present housing programme is thewant  of  balance  between  certain  trades  (e.g.,   the  relativeshortage of  bricklayers and plasterers),. and  as  this discrepancy-should be rectified,  the Committee recommends that instructionshould be given  to the local apprenticeship committees to exer-cise  a  certain discretion as to the number of apprentices in therespective trades until the balance is adjusted.  The Committee  further  recommends  that  these apprenticesbe accepted up to 20 years of age.   Special  consideration shall,however, be given  to applicants who have had  previous experi-ence of the  trade (e.g., building trade labourer).  That  appren-tices so entering  the trade prior to their 20th birthday shall servenot less than four years, subject however in exceptional  circum-stances to their  right to apply 1o their local joint committee topass a test as qualified craftsmen after three years&apos;  training.  The following scale of payment is recommended for apprenticesunder this scheme :      First 6 months 40  per cent, of the journeyman&apos;s wage.     Second    ,,    45     ,,      ,,     Third    ,,     50     ,,    Fourth    ,,    55     Fifth     ,,     60     ,,     Sixth     ,,     65     Seventh   ,,    75    Eighth   ,,     85Possible sources of variation of the cost of labour.  It is understood  that maximum costs  will be agreed upon aspart  of  the general  housing  scheme.    Such estimates  will necessarily be based upon the circumstances prevailing at the time they are made.  The Committee has therefore considered it ad-visable to indicate shortly certain factors, affecting such estimates,which  may vary  during the progress of the scheme and have an effect upon  results.  Wages  in the  building industry are determined at present ona national basis  by  the National Wages  and Conditions  council for the Building Industry.  The rules of  that  Council provide,inter alia, that half yearly  (January and July)  the  Council shallreview the rates of  wages to ascertain whether, owing to yaria-tions in the cost of living,  an adjustment is  due under a sliding scale,  and if such a variation  has occurred, and will justify  a variation of not less than one halfpenny, the Council has to effectamadjustment accordingly.   There is provision for interim adjust-ment  within the six monthly periods in certain circumstances.The. Council has also the duty imposed  upon it of grading the
various districts in their right relation to one another (e.g.,a rateapplicable to a big industrial centre would not be applicable to a rural area) and any locality has the right to ask for its grading tobe reviewed and if it can establish a case for transfer to anothergrade the Council can make such  transfer.   It is also  possiblethat by agreement a constitutional amendment may  take placewhich would alter the status of the whole of the  building tradeoperatives.  Bearing in mind the adverse effect upon the building industry of certain employers seeking to take advantage of  a shortage, orsurplus of, labour by varying the wages payments according to thestate of trade, the Committee is strongly &apos;0f opinion that, in thecase of contracts .placed &apos;under the Government housing  scheme,it should be made an offence to pay either more or less than the agreed standards for monetary payments.   In the case of con-tracts involving  the  expenditure of  Government  money,  that object could and should be secured by a suitable provision.in the contracts, but legislation would appear to be necessary fully toprotect the  interests of all concerned.  Tire values given in the Report by the Committee are basedupon the current output, and depend upon its being maintained.Experience of recent years has shown some remarkable variations in the rates of output, and although, so far as the Committeecan see, there is no sudden  change to  be apprehended,  it isthought advisable in this connection to mention the possibility.  There  is  also  the  question  of  the  economic value  of theaugmented  labour, especially during the earlier  stages of thescheme, which might affect the prices which could  be quoted.  The Committee is very desirous of obviating, as far as practi-cable, the transferring of labour from district to district  underthis scheme. Experience has shown that such a process is verycostly.  The Committee therefore again emphasises its pi-eviousremarks as to a suitable distribution of contracts over the availableemployers of each district, which, in &quot;its  opinion;  will obviateto a great extent the&apos;need  for transferring labour from one district to another.  This carries  with it, however, the implication thatin letting contracts over a given district the aggregate numberof houses let should harmonise with the labour available in thedistrict.Machinery  for managing the Scheme.  The time at the disposal of the Committee does not permit theworking out in full detail  of the machinery necessary for manag-ing the scheme,  but a general idea  may be given of what theCommittee has in mind.  It is  understood ithat&apos; a Statutory  Committee having certain powers will he  established ias. part of the legislative proposals ofthe Government and will have the general loversight and directionof  the  scheme.   It AS ,also evident that  .the National. JointBuilding Committee will, require  -to  have  subordinate  localcommittees  as its active instruments .for giving effect, to various
 matters in the localities where houses are required to be erected, and in  particular to deal with labour supplies  and the  provision of  the  additional apprentices required.   Such  local joint com- mittees should be composed of representatives from the  local em- ployers&apos; and  operatives&apos;  bodies  concerned who are represented upon the National House Building Committee.  The size of the local committees, and  the  distribution of representation to be arranged locally, as may be found convenient, having regard to the area and size of  the operations contemplated.   The expenses of operating the Local Committees to be borne jointly and in propor- tion to  representation.   Appeal in case of dispute to be to the National House Building Committee or any  Sub-Committee ap- pointed  by it to deal with such matters. The local committees to be charged with the duty of keeping a register of all apprentices taken under the scheme; for approving applicants; for ascertaining the total number of apprentices held by any applicant employer; and for  seeing that a suitable probationary period is  provided for each apprentice prior to his  being indentured.  The local committees would ascertain also the available local supplies of suitable youths.   The  Committee  suggest that, in  the first  case, the  local authorities shall  notify  the  local  joint  committees  of  their application  for Government  grant  under  the Housing Act. Immediately the contract has been  placed with the contractor,. or a sanction given for  subsidy payment to a private individual, notification shall  at once be sent to  the same  joint committee. It shall  be an instruction to  the contractor  to notify the local joint committee of the number of men he intends to employ on the  contract, and to state the number of apprentices in his em- ployment, making application for  the necessary further quota for the housing contract.  It shall be the duty  of the local joint committee to see  that the provision of the necessary apprentices&quot; under this scheme is forthcoming.  It is  understood that the respective trade unions concerned will facilitate the admission  of  apprentices  taken  under this scheme  into their unions under an  appropriate  rule.  A  standard form of  contract should be  arranged containing provisions which  will  enable the local  committees to carry  out their duties under the scheme.  To enable the applicants to  be placed upon housing contracts it will be necessary for a certain amount of co-ordination to be arranged between the local authorities and the  local committee, so that the latter has information of the placing  of each contract. As  that  might not  cover  the  whole  of the  ground, every pro- proprietor,  who  receives  a subsidy in respect of houses which he proposes to  place for building with  a contractor,  shall utilise with such contractor the form  of contract referred to above.  In the opinion of this Committee every effort should locally be made to facilitate technical  training of indentured labour.  It will be the function of the  Local Joint Committee, with suchNational joint guidance and assistance  as  will  be necessary, to
provide the amount of augmented labour, varying from  time totime, according to the increased demand, so that the undertaking to build a certain number of houses each year, will be carriedout.  This will involve the careful revision of the Labour supply at frequent intervals.Generally.  It  will be noted  that the Committee has endeavoured to setout the facts as fairly and unreservedly as possible, and to proposeonly  those means for augmenting  the  supply of labour which appear to be capable of application  by the collaboration with good  will of the employers&apos; and operatives&apos; organisations  con-cerned, with the Government, and the  local authorities.  It is hardly possible to say at  present at what rate augmenta-tion will result  by the application of the scheme,  but the Com-mittee believes  that the  ultimate  result would undoubtedly be such  an augmentation of the  skilled  labour in the  industry as would enable  it to cope with all possible demands.
MATERIALS  SUPPLY.  Attention has been given to question of the supply of materialsunder the following headings :-      (1) The provision of the necessary  amount  of materials in           order that a  full defined housing programme might           be achieved.     (2) The methods and means of transportation of materials           to the area in which the immediate  demand  exists.     (3) The method  of ordering supplies.     (4) The necessary arrangements which might from time to           time be necessary for  increasing supplies.     (5) The general  question of prices.  /These and  certain  other problems which arose were  carefully considered by the Materials Supply Sub-Golmmittee in  the firstinstance.The present output of materials of their respective classes so  far     as it affects housing construction.  It is roughly estimated that for the provision of 50,000 housesadditional  to housing  schemes already in  progress or underconsideration  (i.e., 40,000 under the  1923 Act) the additionalmaterials required will be :       Bricks  (18,000 per house)......       900,000,000      Boilers or Coppers ...    ......           50,000Grates (5 per house)TimberCement and  limeBaths......Back BoilersPedestals    ....Lavatory  BasinsSlating and tilingLead  ...            250,000(Standards) 125,000...   (Tons) 245,000...  .         50,000             50,000             50,000             50,000... (Squares) 335,000...   (Tons)  15,000  The Committee is of the opinion that  the supplies of materialsavailable at the  present  time do not indicate any considerableamount of reserves.   It is also felt that this position tends to cause a rise of prices.  As regards certain materials,  particularly inthe case of bricks and slates, it is probable that there is an actualshortage existing at the moment in some districts.  The fact  thatthere is at the present time a pressing demand for similar materials for building work other than housing must, it was felt, consider-ably affect the market as regards the prices of materials requiredin connection with housing schemes.  The Committee has been making investigations into the possible supplies of coal in the nearfuture, coal being  a large  factor in the  cost of most building materials,  particularly bricks.   Investigations are  also  beingmade into  the available  supplies of lead and the possibilities of increased  supplies in the future.Estimated  programme of houses to  be erected during  a series of    years.  The extent of the housing programme is  a matter  to  whichthe Committee has  given very careful attention.  It is considered
that tho number of houses to be erected should show an increase from year to year as the arrangements intended to, be  made foraugmented labour and increasing supplies of materials becameeffective.   As regards the range of the extended programme, ithas been finally agreed that the following figures could be regardedas representing a progressive housing scheme and one which it is felt that the industries concerned will be able  to undertake duringthe course of the ten-year period 1925-1934.Estimated maximum output of houses per year :-  The Committee is of  opinion that  under the  most favourable circumstances, and allowing for no increase in Building and othernew  Housing,built  would be      1925      1926      1927      1928      1929the maximum  number&apos;  of  houses that  could be 90,000100,000110,000120,000135,00019301931193219331934150,000170,000190,000210,000225,000  These figures, allowing for the five further years (to make upthe 15  years&apos;  programme) maintaining a production of  225,000houses  per annum, represent a total of approximately 2,500,000houses, an average of  170,000 houses  per annum.   The  figures given axe inclusive of houses built under the Housing Acts whetherby private enterprise or otherwise.  The  Committee  considers  that  it  may  not be possible  toreach this standard  of production owing to  circumstances over which the Industry has no control.   We are  prepared, however,to undertake that the minimium production would be two-thirds ofthe figures given above, because  it  will take necessary time forthe Scheme to get into working order, and  for the  augmentedlabour to reach  the  standard of efficiency required.  Allowancemust, therefore, be made for this..  As regards  the immediate, programme to be&apos;&quot;attempted duringthe current  year, it is proposed, that the following figures shouldbe put forward as representing a detailed scheme, in addition tothe contracts  which it is understood  have already been placed under the 1923 Housing Act.Easing the Scheme starting on April 1st, 1924.	Orders to be placed at approximately this ratio.	Houses to be completed.	Balance oi un-completed houses carried over.1924. By April 1st...... By May 1st ...... By June 1st...... By July 1st......

The augmentation of materials  required  in connection with the     housing proposals.   The Committee feels that the  amount of the increased suppliesof building materials which should be produced should not belimited only to such increase as is essential for the housing pro-posais,  but that an effort should be made to enhance the avail-able supplies above that  standard, in  order that the anticipatedincreased demands of building work other than on houses shouldbe readily  complied with.   The Committee  is of the opinionthat there should prove to  be a steadily increasing demand forall classes  of building materials,  in  addition to  the  demandbrought about  by the housing programme.    The increase of housing itself will automatically create the  further demand for public buildings, e.g., schools, churches, chapels.   It is put  forward for consideration  that, in  order to assist the carrying out  of  the full proposals,  the State should make thenecessary  provision  to  enable  facilities  to  be  given  to meetapproved applications for capital, it is felt that, not only wouldreasonable  facilities  in this direction,  considerably assist in  theexpediting of housing work,  but  also that actual economies would thereby be effected.   The Committee desires to suggest that the  State should take such  steps  as will  ensure  that  all the  various manufacturingfacilities in connection with building trade materials which werebeing carried on prior to the war, should resume their operationsas far  as  is  found possible.   It is further  regarded  as  beingentirely essential,  to the  successful  carrying through of  thehousing proposals, that the augmentation of the supply of bu&apos;ld-ing materials for housing schemes should not be allowed to affectadversely the  ordinary requirements  of  the  building  industry a.^art from  housing.  The Committee  strongly feels, therefore,that there should be a sufficient increase in the  supply of building materials in order to meet adequately the  growing demands bothin the case of the  housing  programme and in the case of theexpansion  of purely private building  enterprise, otherwise the calculations upon which  the housing proposals have been basedmay be  seriously affected,  and  difficulties may arise which  itwould seem could  well be avoided by due consideration  of thelength of the programme involved.The ability of the Materials Industries to provide  the required    additional supplies without  serious increases in price being    involved.  One of the crucial  difficulties is undoubtedly concerned withthe means whereby the necessary building materials can be forth-coming  to  permit of  the  ready  carrying  out of the housing programme and  the consequent absorption  of the augmentedbuilding labour.  With undertakings for an increase in the ranks of certain  classes of building trade operatives there must  alsobe similar undertakings that the materials shall be available for
the continuous employment of the added labour.  With a viewto the careful consideration of the whole question of the supplyof building  materials meetings have  taken place  with  repre-sentatives of the manufacturers.   As  far as has been possiblein the short  period which has been available for a due considera-tion of the matter, and of all the questions and circumstancesinvolved, the manufacturers of materials have given their  bestassurances that an adequate supply will be forthcoming, and thatarrangements will  be made  for  a  greatly  increased supply to meet the  full  requirements  of  the housing  programme.This question has accordingly been dealt with in a detailed report which the representatives of the building materials manufacturers are submitting, a copy of which is added as an Appendix to thepresent Eeport (see Appendix B).  The Committee gladly acceptsthis Eeport, but are apprehensive  as  to  the lead position.   TheCommittee desires to lay stress on the fact that in  many waysbuilding materials must be  regarded as an important  factor of theproblem  which is before the whole industry.   It is a possibleclanger that, even with the  whole-hearted desire of the industry to order  otherwise,  there may be such increases  in prices as willmilitate  against  the entire success  of the proposed  scheme.Eollowing an increased demand, there may be an upward tendency of prices, and the  Committee strongly feels that the  StatutoryCommittee,  which it is understood  will be  set up under  theHousing Act,  should be  invested  with  powers  in   order  toprevent, wherever possible,  unduly increased charges, being addedas from 1st March, 1924, not justified by increased cost  of labourand raw materials both as regards prices and delivery.  It is con-sidered that this presents a problem the  settlement of which theStatutory Committee should have effecive charge.   The Committee  also  desires to emphasise that with the in-creased production it should prove that the unit cost  would bereduced.The method of preventing unduly enhanced prices  of materials.    The method of dealing with  individual attempts to  exploit    the market.   The Committee  recommends that, for the  purpose of dealingwith&apos;  outstanding  attempts  to increase prices, the   StatutoryCommittee under the Housing Act should have adequate authority to examine carefully any suggested increase in  the price ofmaterials before such increase becomes operative.   It is suggested, therefore, for consideration, that every proposed increase in  prices should  be submitted for the  approval of the Statutory Committee prior Vfco such  increase  being allowed to operate. The Committee also submits for consideration that theGovernment&apos; should by Act of Parliament take  such  steps as maybe considered necessary to prevent any individual or organisationseeking to exploit the situation.
 The danger of  labour  demands upsetting the undertakings as     to maintenance of current prices.   The Committee is well aware that advances in wages and1 cost of raw materials will cause an increase  in the price of building materials.  It considers, however, that this might be somewhat modified by reductions in the on-cost charges of production due to the increased demand.   It  will doubtless also  be possible to further meet  these advances by improved organisation in the process of manufacture, The distribution of housing schemes and its effect in facilitating     or otherwise the supply of materials.   The Committee has gone very carefully into this question.  The matter  is one which presents many difficulties.   It is essential, in the first place, that the supply of labour  and the  supply of materials should harmonise in any particular district, and  that both these elements should be present  in the right proportions to cope with  the housing needs of that district.   This necessi- tates  a careful and pre-arranged distribution of  contracts,  pre- arranged essentially with a view to a prior consideration of the labour  supply  available,  and  the  materials required.    The Committee desires  to  point  out that difficulties must arise if large housing  schemes are sanctioned or commenced in districts where  the  supply of  labour  or  of  materials,  or  both, is inadequate.  In the event of  this being done,  much unnecessary friction  is  bound  to  arise.  There  would  immediately  arise in the district a pressing need both for labour and  materials, the  result would be that to meet this demand, there would be no alternative possibly but for increased  prices to  be offered for materials, rather than that loss should be sustained owing to a period of delay,  and much dislocation would  thereby arise.   To meet, and, it  is hoped  also to avoid, this position  arising, it is suggested that on the Statutory Committee should be placed the responsibility of  advising as to the general distribution of housing schemes, in order  that a  comprehensive view may be taken, not  only of the  needs of the district, but also as to the means of immediately meeting such needs without producing a state of friction  and unrest which might have unsatisfactory results, not only in the immediate area concerned, but throughout the whole of Great Britain.  The  Committee in putting its  views forward on this  matter are not unmindful of what has actually occurred at other times. The Committee also desires to suggest that when particulars  as to  the housing  needs of a district are put forward, careful investigation should be made, in  order to ensure that the real needs of  the district are represented by the claim  or  appli- cations put forward.  Whilst recording  its  opinions  on this point the  Committee desires   to  add  that  a  general survey,  showing, &quot;as  far  as possible,  the  housing proposals of each district,  would be ofgreat assistance to the Statutory Committee.  Such a survey would
enable this Committee to compile a corresponding survey of thelabour supply and the materials supply both available  and needed in the various localities.The provision of adequate and economical transport facilities for     materials.  The Committee feels  that the present transport facilities are inadequate to deal satisfactorily with the distribution  of a largely increased bulk  of building material.  The question  of transportforms a large factor in the successful carrying out of the housingproposals,  cost  of rail transport, delay  on rail,  excessivefreightage  charges all  tend  to hamper  building  and also toincrease  prices.   The  Committee accordingly suggests that theGovernment  should, by such powers as it may be necessary toassume, assist in the provision of adequate  and economical meansof rail transport for materials required for pse in connection withState-assisted housing  schemes.  In the  opinion of  the  Com-mittee the freightage charges at present in operation should be considerably  lowered, particularly having regard to the fact thatthere would  shortly  follow, an  increased  demand for building materials in  almost every district.   It  is further suggested thatthis is a matter to which early attention should be given.Control and allocation  of materials.  As regards the allocation of materials, to  ensure that the  needsof a particular  district are adequately met, the  Committee con-siders that circumstances may render it  necessary,  at  some stage of the housing  activities, for provision  to  be made for a certain measure of control, though every effort  should be made to avoid this, the Committee being of opinion that freedom from control is desirable. It is suggested, however, that the Statutory Committeeshould be enabled to assume to a certain extent,  and when foundunavoidable,  a  system  of  supervision  over the  allocation  ofmaterials for  house construction to any  particular district.   It is felt that unless  suitable  arrangements can be made on the  lines indicated a recurrence  of what has occurred in the past may takeplace, and it  may be found at times that whilst in some districtsthere is a surplus of building materials  in others there may be a deficiency.  It  is also  hoped that the establishment of a definitemeans of ordered allocation might, in some measure, tend toprevent local advantages being taken of the increased demand,and also to assist in economy of working.Specification  of materials.  The Committee  considers that in drafting specifications for materials  for   housing purposes   it   should   be   a  standinginstruction  that  materials  which  can   be  obtained locallyshould  be utilised  as  far  as  possible.   It   is  also recom-
 mended  that when  suitable  materials  are  readily  available- near the site of a  proposed  housing scheme,  it  should  not be open to specify materials which have to be  brought  from a distance.  Permission-, however, should not be refused if  it were&apos; considered essential to meet certain special requirements of any particular district. The Committee also suggests  that more scope should be given  than hitherto in allowing contractors  to take advantage of  alternative materials in order to overcome difficulties in special districts in which an unusual shortage of certain building materials may otherwise  retard work upon housing.    In  thisconnection the Committee  would view with favour the use of stone, or alternative materials where  a sufficient supply of bricks is not readily available.   As regards the use of lead also, it may no doubt be found possible in some  districts, though not in all, to make use of iron and copper for certain sections of  work in which lead hashitherto been  most generally employed. The Committee mentions these two particular cases as examples only as the matter is one which would  require further  careful consideration.  The Com-mittee desires to mention, however, that its attention has  already been drawn to eases which have actually arisen in certain districts where the  supplies of bricks  are barely sufficient to meet the present  demands but where supplies of stone are available.  In these circumstances  the Committee considers that use of stone or other materials as an alternative should be adopted in order to allow the full housing programme to be continued.   The Committee, on the other hand,  desires to point out that it has been the  experience  in the past that materials  have some- times been specified  for house  building which are not considered by the Committee to be suitable for the use to which such mate- rials have been  put.    Aa an  example of this,  the  Committeedesires to mention the use of stains made  from tar derivatives for coating  joinery. The right and opportune ordering  oi materials in order to ensure     the preparation ol materials in time.   As regards  the ordering of materials, the Committee desires to suggest that, in order to  enable the material manufacturers or suppliers to  meet  the requirements  expected  of them, there should be a  condition attaching to  all  contracts that all orders for materials  should be placed within a given time from the date.of the signing of the contract.  The Committee considers that the adoption of a provision of  this nature would be of great assistance in  keeping  suppliers well-informed as  to the  immediate  and forthcoming  needs  of particular  areas,  and  would  also render possible a ready  and continuous flow of materials. Price to distributors or merchants.    The  Committee is of  the  opinion  that  the present  terms allowed by the various manufacturers&apos; associations to  distributors
or merchants admit of revision in view of the future increased demands.  It is suggested that this  might be a matter  whichshould fall to be dealt with by the Statutory Committee.Scotland.  The Committee desires to report that meetings have been heldin Scotland  with a view  to  making  preliminary  arrangementsfor the adoption of a similar line  of  action in Scotland to thatof the House Building Committee as a whole.  On 8th March,1924, a conference was held in Edinburgh at which the Secretaryfor Scotland, and the Minister  of Health were present, togetherwith the Parliamentary  Under-Secretary of Health for Scotland,who  presided.  The following resolution was adopted  at  a full  meeting  ofrepresentatives  of building trade employers and operatives, andof manufacturers of building materials :       &quot; Subject to satisfactory conditions and guarantees the    building and materials industries in  Scotland  are prepared    to do the utmost to help the Government in  the proposed    housing scheme.&quot;  The Committee is informed that the present output of bricksin Scotland is only about 227,000,000 per annum. It is understoodthat  this can readily be increased to 300,000,000 in order to make provision for the  housing programme.   The Committee is  ofopinion that steps should  be  taken with a view to  co-ordination in the supply of materials.  It is also desired to recommend thatthe  use  of  stone  should be  encouraged  as far  as  possible,particularly  where there is an undoubted shortage in the supplyof bricks.  The question of railway freightage is also a matter asto which the Committee would desire to recommend that assist-ance, with a view to quick  transport and economy,  should  be afforded in the case of materials for  housing schemes.  At  the  meetings  which  have been   held  the  Committee has  agreed  that the broad  lines recommended  by  the HouseBuilding Committee generally,  shall be adopted as regards Scot-land,  subject  to  such  minor  modifications  as  may  be  foundnecessary, and approved by the main committee.   The  Committee desires also to report  that visits have been made to certain types of housing schemes, in Glasgow, for the purposes  of comparing  costs  in  Scotland with typical  actual tenders for houses in  England.   Arrangements are being made for an extension of the Scottish Committee  by the  addition of co-opted members representative of employers and operatives in all the trades  concerned.   The Committee desires to add that it is  in  sympathy with all the views  and  proposals indicated v&apos;in the other sections of the House Building Report, and that early steps will be taken
for the full operation  of  the work  of  the  Committee  in itsendeavour to perfect a working scheme for application in scotland on the lines of the proposals already set  out by the committee as a whole.

WE, the Committee  of  Building Materials  Manufacturers  and Sup-pliers appointed  at your request by  the Manufacturers  and  Suppliersattending  the Conference at the Ministry of Health on February  19th,1924, have the honour to submit our First Report on the questions whichhave  been placed before us.  The members of the Committee are as follows:     Representing Brick  and  Clay Industries.       Mr.  GEORGE  ANDREWS, Sifctingbourne.       Mr.  GEORGE BARLOW, Acorington.       Mr.  H. J.  C.

SUPPLIES OF BUILDING MATERIALS FOR HOUSING SCHEMES.  We have been  asked to report on the available supplies for a housing scheme which  provides  that for the  first year 85,000  houses would  becompleted by means of added labour brought into the Building Industry.*   * NOTE. Since tlw  Committee completed this Report, tlte number of housesproposed to be built in the first year has been reduced from 86,000 to 60,000, rideReport of Labour Supply Sub- Committee of National House Building Committee.  Thefull yearly quantities of materials stated in the Schedule will tlierehre not be requ Wedmtil 1927.
To  this must be added 40,000, the number of houses which  it is  statedwould be  built during  the same period by private enterprise and  under present Local Authority  Schemes.  No  allowance  has been mado  for houses in course of  erection at the beginning and  end of  the  yearlyperiod,  and  for  this we  have computed an  equivalent in  materials of20,000 houses, making a total of 145,000.  An  approximate estimate of the  quantities of materials required for theconstruction  of this number of houses is as follows:  2,610,000,000 Bricks.              Note.-For  every house built in  concrete  deduct  18,000                Bricks and add 6 tons Cement.    360,000  tons Cement.    430,000  tons  Lime.    320,000  Standards of  Timber.              Note.-Quantity to.be increased by Timber used for carcase                in case of concrete houses.   1,000,000  Squares  Slating or Tiling.      30,000 tons Lead.   1,500,000  cube yards broken brick or other  aggregate.   2,500,000 cube  yards  Sand.    145,000  Baths, Closets and Sinks,  with Cisterns,  Wastes,  Taps, &amp;c.    145,000  Washing Coppers.    - 145,000  Galvanised Cisterns.    145,000 Hot Water Cylinders.    145,000  Boilers.    700,000  Ranges and Grates.  11,000,000  feet C.I. Gutter and Rain-water Pipes.   3,000,000  yards Drain  Pipes.    145,000  Stoneware Traps.   7,250,000  dozen Screws.       8,500  tons Nails.  16,000,000  square feet Glass.        780  tons Glue.       3,625  tons Oil  Putty.        450  tons Red Lead.                                   ,        580 tons Size.Other Materials.    Door  and Window Furniture.    Lavatory Basins.    Floor Tiles.    Chimney Pots.    Pain/ts.    Gas and  Electric Light Fittings, Meters,  &amp;c.  The Committee has, by  means of  Sub-Committees  and enquiries  by individual members, endeavoured to  obtain,  in the short time  at its disposal,  the fullest  possible  information regarding  tho  ability of thevarousi trades to supply  these quantities of  materials,  in  addition  to dealing with a normal demand from sources other than Housing Schemes.  It will be appreciated that the Committee has been met with  considerabledifficulty  by  reasons  of two main factors : -   1. The  absence of  accurate information as  to the geographical  distn-bution of the Houses.  This  is  particularly   important with regard toBricks, and  the information collected must be taken to refer chiefly to total  output, requiring some modification and re-consideration when theCommittee knows where the Houses are to be built.  2. The lack of knowledge as to the proportion of Concrete  Houses.  Briehs. Replies received  to the Oommittee&apos;s questionoire show a totalproductive capacity of existing plants in excess of 4,000,000,000 Bricks per
annum;   A  considerable number  of  the  manufacturers  express   their willingness to carry out extensions of plant  if they had  a prospect of an assured demand for a number of years. .Others say that existing  works which are shut down could be refitted  and re-opened,  and in some cases there is  a suggestion  that  financial  assistance should  be forthcoming.The Committee has also received a number of communications from firms and individuals who state they have suitable raw material  for briokmaking,some of whom also ask for financial assistance, and the Committee has hadthese fully recorded.   Until  it is  known  what will be  the demand1 forBricks in each district, it is  impossible to accurately define the positionof available supplies.  Regarding  Stocks of Bricks, full  information is not  available,  but insome districts  there are many millions  in&apos;stock.  As is usual  in suoh cases, replies to the  request  for  a  statement of productive capacity have not been received  from every maker, but prob-ably 5,000 millions would represent a fair estimate of the present maximumoutput.   It  will be seen, therefore, that  twice the  number  of   Bricksrequired  for the first year&apos;s programme can  be manufactured by existingplants, even assuming that the whole of the 145,000 Houses were built ofBricks.  The Brick position must,  however, be further investigated whenthe geographical distribution of the housing demand is ascertained, aswithout this  information   individual  manufacturers  cannot  give  anypledge as to the proportion of their output they are prepared to allocateto Housing Schemes. It will undoubtedly be most desirable that the  alloca-tion of Brick houses, particularly  in the earlier stages of the working ofthe Scheme, should be  regulated  by  the  available  Brick  supplies inparticular districts.  Due attention must bo given to the  fact  that the whole  of  the  houseswill  not  be built entirely of  Bricks.   In some districts especially, those where Bricks are not readily obtainable Concrete construction may be preferred, and  in some  parts of Scotland,  as well as certain districts inEngland,  Stone would be  used either  for  the whole construction  of forexterior facings.  Hoofing- Tiles. The Committee  is informed1 that the  present facilitiesfor output will turn out 500,000 squares of Roofing Tiles  per annum.  the manufacturers  say that, with an assurance of an accession of trade for areasonable period,, the above quantity  could within  a  few  months beincreased by 25 per cent.  Slates. The  returns  furnished  to the  Committee show that  there areat the present moment  sufficient Slates in stock at the Quarries to cover30,000 to 40,000 houses, and the  estimated output  of Slates on presentshort-time working would sufficie  for  the roofing of llSiOOO houses  perannum as a minimum.    The present output is  less than one-half theaverage output of the years 1903 to 1913, and; taking into account the factthat most of the Slate quarries are much  better  equipped  as regardsmachinery than in pre-war years, it would- appear that, with an assurance of continued demand the supply  could  be  rapidly  and  considerably increased.  No difficulty is anticipated in securing the  requisite amountof additional labour.  One of the greatest troubles in the Slate industryis the insistence upon particular sizes.  The sizes produced  vary accordingto  the size of  the&apos; rock  available at the  quarries, and it  ought  to be impressed upon local authorities that they  must be prepared to accept thesizes which  are available.   Cement and  Lime. The Committee is informed  that the home produc-tion of cement  is ample for all requirements. There is at present  in  one area a  shortage of a certain kind of pure lime  used  for   plastering.There is no reason to believe that this shortage is other than temporary,caused by increased demands for  this  class of lime from the steel,  glass and chemical trades, which ^lad for some time previously been taking less than their normal quantities.
   The Committee is assured  that existing plants are capable of supplying the whole of  the  Lime required for  the Houses  to  be built under the Scheme, in addition to coping with  the demand for other work.   In case of need,  for plastering purposes it would be possible to substi- tute  other limes for the pure limes.     Lead. It is understood that the Ministry of Health is fully informed as to the Lead position, and the Committee  therefore has not thought it necessary to consider  the question at great length.  There is undoubtedly sufficient plant in  existence in this country to cope with the maximum requirements indicated by  the Scheme,  but it   is,  pointed  out  that 98 per cent, of the raw material is imported and that the manufacturers have  no  control  over the  supply   of  raw material, having  to  buy in the worlcFs open market.   There is  every reason  to  believe that if the British  Government  can  give some  satisfactory assurance  of a continuing demand over  a  number of years, the producers,  particularly in Australia, would make arrangements for the requsite increase of out- put.   Evidence that this is possible  is to be found  in the  fact [-hat at one period during the war the Australian annual output was nearlycelqicrii the present output.                                             oi\ i   Other Materials. As regards all  other   materials  included  m oilhe schedule, the Committee has received definite assurances from organisations qualified to  speak  on behalf  of the large majority of the manufacturers throughout the country that the anticipated  demand can be, and will be, met.                      FIFTEEN  YEARS&apos;  PROGRAMME.                 r   The Committee has  come  to the conclusion that, in most tranches of the trade, the demand for  materials  required for  the maximum annual number  of Houses provided  by the  Scheme during the  15 years  could be met by present  facilities  of manufacturers.    In some other branches it  is probable that the demand  would  overtake the maximum output after a  certain number of years,  but,  assuming  that   the necessary assurances can be  given  for  the continuance  of  the Scheme and early information  furnished  as to  the localities in  which materials   will  be required, the  Committee has  no  reason to believe that the necessary augmentation  of  ontput could  not be  secured  by  means  of  private enterprise.                           STANDARDISATION.   The Committee  has  been  asked  to  point  out that, in  several trades, the  production would  be assisted and  costs reduced by the  adoption of standard sizes and patterns by the Local  Authorities, etc., concerned, and it is suggested that the Ministry  of Health could usefully set ..up some form of machinery whereby  the  necessary  co-ordination between users and the manufacturers in these trades  could  ba established.  In the Timber trade,  on the other hand, it  is  requested that there should be no general  standardisation, as any decision to use standardised sizes only for  the joists, rafters and parlins would cause a  shortage of  those sizes  and an increase of price due to the extra sawing and waste.   As  previously stated, the supply of Slates in the  required quantities is dependent upon  all available sizes being used.   Certain industries, particularly Light Castings, desire in  the  interests of rapid  and economical production that existing standardised patterns should be utilised  as far as possible.                             DISTRIBUTION.   The Committee does  not consider that  any serious  difficulty will  occur in connection with the  distribution  of  materials, other than the  questionof Bricks, previously mentioned.
  When&apos; assurances can  be  given  that  the  anticipated   demand  willmaterialise, the Committee would recommend to the various organisationsin the  trades  the  consideration  of  the  establishment  of  a  central&quot; Materials Distribution Bureau &quot;  which would  record statistics relatingto supplies and demand, organise  as far as possible the distribution inparticular districts to meet the demand, and deal with any complaints asto shortage of materials.          NON-RESTIUOTION OF GENERAL BUILDING  OPERATIONS.  The Committee is in full agreement with the  opinion of &quot; Builders aiidOperatives  Committee,&quot;  that no official control or restriction should beplaced  upon   ordinary  building operations, whether  in the  form of&quot;luxury &quot;  buildings or otherwise.    Many of the materials  required forsuch buildings are  of a  different class  from those employed on HousingSchemes,  and the shutting down or restriction of work of this kind wouldresult in unemployment of many  skilled  workmen  who  would   not be     /able on the production of Housing  materials.      Committee further urges that the policy of  non-curtailment should...   supply to municipal work, which is at  present subject to restriction in consequence of the refusal of the Ministry of Health to sanction loanson  t le ground that labour and materials  are  not  available  for  such purposes.                    PEIOES  AND PIMOE REGULATION.  The  Committee is  in  the happy position  of being able  to pledge theuhole of the organised Manufacturers and Suppliers of Building materials to  a policy of non-exploitation of the Government Housing Scheme forpurposes of inflation of prices.   The responses which have been  receivedfrom the various organisations are  extremely gratifying, reflecting as theydo  the spirit  of co-operation and  goodwill  manifested at the Conferenceof February 19th.  Obviously,  increases in costs due to advance in wages,coal, raw materials, etc., must be  dealt with.  There  are certain  exceptions which will  require special consideration. Some particular goods have been, and  are being sold, below  actual cost price in competition  with imported  articles, or for  other special  reasons. Such eases are not numerous, and the Committee believes that they would not be found  difficult of adjustment.      a  &apos;   As to  the question of control of  prices&apos;,  the Committee is of  opinion that the best way to keep prices at a reasonable  level is  to enlist the goodwill of the Manufacturers and Suppliers,  and to institute no system of  Government  control,  until, at any rate there is definite evidence that the Manufacturers and Suppliers are not &quot;  playing the game &quot;.   Previous experience has shown that Departmental control has  produced results very different from those anticipated,  and that value has certainly not been received for the money expended theron.  Previous methods having proved a failure, the Committee earnestly endorses the view which you expressed at the Conference, viz.,  that a policy of confidence and co-operation would achieve the most satisfactory results.                 . :   If, however,  it is  felt that the Government must establish some safe-  guard other than a Committee such as that presided over by  Sir Halford  Mackinder the Committee considers  that this should  be  done in such  a  manner as to cause the least measure of irritation to those: to  whom  it is applied.   The Committee&apos;s opinion  is  against  any form of control,  unless proved necessary by events,  and  the only safeguard which  would,  under any circumstances, be considered  feasible is the approval by a  Committee upon which the Manufacturers and Suppliers, should  be repre-  sented-of variations in prices due to alterations in costs of  labour, Taw  materials, fuel, etc.,  basing such variations from the prices actually  in.471)46
 force on  a certain  date say March 1st,  1924 and making,  of course, due allowance for any special circumstances as previously mentioned.   The  Committee understands that it is  recommended that the Governmeu should  provide, in the Housing Bill, for  the establishment  of a &quot;Statutory House  Building Committee&quot;,  upon  which the manufacturers would have adequate representation, and that  this Committee should be given  powers to deal with this question, if necessary.                     FOREIGN MANUFACTURED GOODS.   jln  the iopinion of  the Committee,  it is  extremely desirable, in the National  interests, that no  Foreign manufactured goods should1 be used on  houses built under Government  subsidy.   It requires no arguments to show the fallacy  of any  policy which,  while relieving  unemployment in  one  branch of  industry,  replaces  the product of home labour  by- materials  imported  from foreign  countries.    Fully recognising  the necessity of economy on  all hands in the carrying out of the Government Scheme, the  Committee suggests that  Foreign manufactured  materials should only be  permitted to be used by consent  of the proposed Statutory Committee who, when making its investigations,  should  fully take into account the benefits which the use of homo manufactured goods  would secure for the Country in the shape of providing increased employment- with the resultant easing  of the burdens connected with the provision of Unemployment Benefits and Poor Relief and corresponding additional revenue from National and Local Taxation.   Cases  have   been  reported to  the Committee  where  Architects,  in pursuance of certain &quot;artistic&quot;  ideas,  have refused to permit  tho  use of British Slates, and have insisted  upon the roofs  of the houses  being carried  out,  at increased  cost,  in  foreign tiles.  This,  the  Committee suggests, should not be permissible in connection  with any Housing Scheme subsidised by British  taxpayers.  The only possible excuse for  the use of foreign materials  could be a very substantial saving upon the cost of available home  productions,  after&apos; taking into  consideration the factors mentioned in the preceding paragraph.     It  would  be very  difficult for  the Committee to  take any  steps towards increase of output entailing installation of additional  plant or extension  of works in any section of the trade unless there were some safeguards against the unrestricted  use of foreign  manufactured  goods on the houses built under the Scheme.                          RAILWAY FACILITIES.   The Committee calls  attention to the fact that at the present time the erection of Industrial  Dwellings  is being delayed by the  failure of tho Railway Companies to  furnish sufficient  Railway wagons to deal with the traffic in  materials.   It  is strongly urged that, before  the  increased demand for  materials  indicated by the  new proposals comes about, the Government should take steps to ensure  that the various Railway  Cbm- panies should provide the  necessary number of  wagons  not only  to cope with the present requirements but to afford  adequate transport  for the additional output. ;  In conclusion, Sir,  we desire to express our thanks for the opportunity whioh you  have afforded  to us an  opportunity unique  in the annalsof the Industries we represent.   Your  invitation-your  friendly challenge-to the  Manufacturers and Suppliers themselves to grapple with the problem of the supply of  building materials in adequate quantities  for  a much-needed scheme for  the pro-vision of houses has caused  much gratification.   That invitation,  thatohallehge,  we accept on behalf of those  who have charged us with  theirrepresentation,  and,  although realising to the full the  magnitude of oar
task, we give you the fullest assurance that the Scheme may be carried forward without any distrust as to the supply of the necessary materials.  Given the confidence of your own and succeeding Governments, the co-operation  of  the Manufacturers  and  Suppliers will  achieve what no government  Departmental  control or system of organisation could everachieve.                    We have the honour to be,                               Sir,                                 Your obedient Servants,                                    On behalf of the Committee,                                        H. J. C. JOHNSTON,                                                    Ghairmam.                                        P. M. STEWART,                                                    Vice-Ohairman.  loft April, 1924.(-17040-14)  Wt, 31220-P 9  4000 4/24 H. St.  G.7
