I submit to the Home Affairs Committee a Memorandumby the Secretary for Mine3 covering a draft Bill to removedoubt as to the period allowed during which a workman maybe below ground.                                  (intd.) s/.?.11th April, 1924,
            MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY FOR MIMES.     I should, like to have the approval of the Cabinet tointroduce a one-clause Bill, to amend Section 1 of the CoalMines Regulation Act, 1908, for the purpose of removing doubt as to the maximum period during which a workman working in ashift may &quot;be below &apos; ground.     Administratively, the Act has always been held to mean that the period is seven hours plus the time (as approved bythe Inspector) occupied in taking the shift down and bringingit up again.     In 1911, however, it was decided by the High Court ofJusticiary in Scotland that if any one man of the shiftreturned to the surface within seven hours, the rest of theshift might remain below ground for longer than the periodmentioned in the last paragraph without any contravention ofthe Act.  Such a decision, if generally relied upon, wouldvirtually have rendered the Act inoperative, and steps were successfully taken in 1922 to obtain an authoritative decision in the English Courts in support of the administrative view.     But the Scottish decision still holds the field inScotland and many complaints have been made that it is beingrelied upon.  It is very difficult to find a sufficiently clearcase to justify an attempt to get it re-considered in theScottish Court and it is doubtful in any case whether the court would reverse its previous decision.  Hor does any appeal lieto the House of Lords.  It is accordingly proposed to settle the matter by legislation which, in the form proposed (beinglimited to the &quot;removal of doubt&quot;), would not admit of anydebate on the general question of hours in mines, and would benon-contentious.     I attach a detailed note prepared in my Department on thesubjectand a draft Bill..   *                                             E.SHINWELL.
               Draft of a Bill to Amend Seotion 1 of  the                    Goal Mines Regulation Aot,  1908,          to remove doubt as to the period allowed during     which a workman may be below ground.1.       Intention of 1908 Aot.   The Coal Mines Regulation     Act,  1008, .(as amended by the Coal Mines Act, 1319)     fixes the maximum period-during which a workman  (with     certain specified exceptions) may be below ground at     seven hours.          In the oase of men working in a shift,  this rule     if applied without qualification, would necessitate     the men coming out of the mine at the end of the shift     in exactly the same order aB they went in at the     beginning of the shift..   It was recognised, howevor, that     this was impossible in practice, and it was, therefore,     decided &quot;that for&quot;the purposes of the Act the whole     shift should be treated as a single unit.    In the oaao     of workmen working in a shift, therefore,  Sub-section     (2) of Section 1 of the Aot provides that  the Act shall     not be regarded as contravened if the period between     the last member of a shift leaving the surf ace-&apos;and the     first member of a shift returning to the surface does     not exceed seven hours.          Provision is also made (in Sub-section  (4)) for-     limiting the period allowed for winding up and winding     downj and- (in Sub-section (3)) for the times of     winding to be duly published to the workmen  concerned.          The intention was that these Sub-sections (3)  and     (4) should be read in conjunction with Sub-section  (2)     and that the maximum period spent underground, by a     workman working in1a shift should be limited to  seven     hours plus the time allowed for winding up and the  time     allowed for winding down.          This view was accepted by the Law Officers  in
shift was up again within eight  (now seven) hours ofthe last man down it did not matter how long the othersstayed down.     The material portion of Lord Mackenzie&apos;s judgment(in which the Lord Justice General and Lord Kinnearconcurred) is as follows:-     In regard to the second charge here the facts are     that on 24th October 1911 miners were below ground     from 6.5 a.m. till 3.25 p.m. (a period of 9 hours     and 20 minutes), and that on 13th November 1911,     when the inspector of mines visited the colliery,     no cause was entered In the register for these     miners being below ground for the period specified.     The Sheriff-Substitute, however, has found that on     24th October the men worked in a shift, the last man     of which shift left the surface at 6.5 a.m, and     the first man recorded as having returned to the     surface did so at 8.30 a.m.  In these circumstances     it is impossible to hold as regards the second     charge that any of the miners were below ground     for more than the time fixed by the Act. Section 1     (1) deals in terms with the case.  The period     between the time at which the last workman on the     shift left the surface and the time at which the     first workman on the shift returned to the surface     was only 2 hours and 25 minutes.                          3.   1911,  who said (inter alia) &quot;It is true that there  is   no express provision in the Act that all the members   of the shift must have returned to the surface within   any given time,  but we think that this is involved   in the language  of the Act, and that the only difference   between a workman who works with a shift and a workman   who does not is  that the latter must return to the   surface within the actual period of eight hours&quot; (now   seven&quot;) &quot;whereas the former mustreturn within a   conventional period which extends from the time fixed   for the commencement of the lowering to the time fixed   for the completion of the raising of the shift&quot;.II.The case of Stevenson v. Roger.        This view,  however, was upset by a decision in   the Scottish Courts, in the case of Stevenson v. Roger,   to the effect that Sub-sections  (3) and (4) were   irrelevant on this point and that if any man of the
                                                       .: ..&apos; J         - This  decision was not binding  in an English     Court,  but all Scottish decisions receive respectful     consideration In English Courts, and in the result     the decision must be  said to have held the field.III.  Criticism  of-the above decision.           In view of  the law Officers&apos; opinion quoted in     I above, however, there was some doubt whether the     Act could  properly be interpreted in such a way.  The     effect  of  the decision would be to  render the Act     practically Inoperative for           (a) if there is  no obligation  on the men to     observe the winding times as fixed  by Sub-sections     (3) and (4) of Section 1, Sub-section (4) becomes     purposeless, and           (b) the Management could evade the provisions     of the  Aot altogether by bringing only one man of     any particular&apos;shift  to the surface within the     prescribed period. IV.  The Waleswood case.   Wing v^ Skinner and Holford           Limited &quot;ahdi others&apos;.           It was accordingly decided to  take advantage of     the first  suitable case to obtain an authoritative     decision in the  English Courts *&apos; Owing largely to the     war,  the opportunity  did not occur  till the end of     1921, but  information was then laid, and a conviction     obtained,  against a management in Yorkshire which     had,  for its own purposes, kept certain workmen of     a shift below ground  for a period in excess of that     held  to be covered by the Act  (a3 described in I above)           In delivering judgment, the Lord Chief Justice     said  there was probably some ambiguity in the facts     of the  Scottish  case  and In the import of the     decision.    If  Lord  Mackenzie Intended to say that,     when  dealing with a shift, there could be no
     contravention of Sub-section  (l) of Section 1 of     the Act so long as somebody working in that shift complied     with the statutory requirements, he was net prepared to      follow himo  Mr. Justice Bailhache and Mr. Justice Salter     concurred.Vo      Effect of above decision on Scottish CourtsP          The view originally taken by the Home Office, and     the opinion of the Law Officers, was therefore upheld&apos;.     so far as English Courts were concerned,.  But     notwithstanding this decision, the Scottish Miners and     H.M. Divisional Inspector have frequently reported that     Stevenson v. Roger is still relied upon in Scotland,,         . It is very difficult to upset a decision of the     Scottish High. Court of Justiciary in Scotland, much     more so than to get away from the decision in the English     Courts, where it was not binding, though it had held     the field for 10 years *  And up to the present it has     not been possible to find a suitable ease where the     facts could be clearly proved, or the evidence good     enough to justify the attempt to take up the matter     in Scotland.VI.     Proposed legislation it is accordingly proposed to     clear up the matter definitely by introducing a one-     clause Bill to explain what is held to be the true     intention of the original Act.          The proposed Bill is limited to the object cf     &quot;removing doubt&quot; on this one particular point.  It     would therefore not admit cf discussion on the hours     question generally, and could accordingly be,described     as non-contentiouso
                            DRAFT                              OF  A                            BILL.           To explain  subsection  (2) of seotion one of the                 Coal Mines  Regulation Aot, 1903, as amended                 by any .subsequent enactment.           Be it enacted &amp;o.Explanation    1*  For removing  doubts it is hereby declared that soof 8  Edw. 70.57,8.1(2) much  of subsection (2) of section one of the Coal Mines           Regulation Act 1903 (as amended by the Coal Mines Act,           1919), as enacts that &quot;no contravention of the foregoing           provisions shall be deemed to take place&apos; in the case of a           workman working In a shift if the period between the time           at which the last workman in the shift leaves the surface           and the first workman in the shift returns to the surface           does  not exceed seven hours&quot; does not permit a workman           working in a shift to be below ground for a longer period           than  the period between the time fixed (in accordance with           the first mentioned Act) at which the lowering of the shift           is to commence and the time so fixed at which the raising           of the shift is to be completed.Short Title.    2.  This Act may be cited as the Coal Mines Act, 1924,           and the Coal Mines Acts 1887 to 1919 and this Aot may be           cited together as the Coal Mines Acts, 1887 to 1924,
