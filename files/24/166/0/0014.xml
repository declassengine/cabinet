(This document ie the property of His Britannic Majesty1s Government).SECRET^CP. 314(24).CABINET.IRISH &quot;POLITICAL&quot; PRISONERS.Memorandum circulated by the Homo Secretary.krcduotorySeniorial on[ehalf ofRepublicanleaders.Decision may affect otherIrishprisoners.      It will be within the! recollection of my colleagues that on the 4th July 19 23, at the Central Criminal Court,certain Irish Republican leaders, viz. Art 0&apos; Brien,  SeanMcGrath, Denis Fleming, A. Mularkey, T.G. Plynn  and  M.Galvin were convicted of seditious conspiracy and sentenced,as regards 0&apos;Brien and McGrath to two years&apos;, and as regardsthe others, to one year&apos;s imprisonment in the second division.      A Memorial was presented to the late Government inDecember last asking that these prisoners should at  least be treated as political offenders and that the question oftheir release should be considered.   The Memorial was supported by about forty members of the Labour Party, someof whom are now members of the Ministry.   The applicationhas now been renewed through the Rev. H. Dunnico, M.P.while representations  in the same sense have reached me fromother sources.   The question was raised during  theBurnley election but I then declined to say more than thatI would consider on its merits any application that  mightbe made in a particular case.                                    di   &apos;      The representations that have so far reached me relateto 0&apos;Brien and his five fellow prisoners;  but there are other prisoners of Irish origin, convicted in English Courts,whose claim to be regarded as political offenders may con-conceivably be urged if the present applications are acceded to.   A list of these  prisoners is given in an^ appendix./
 questions Release politicaltreatment.erferencethecutiveesirablelitioally&quot;expedient.      Two distinct questions are raised, viz.  (l) releaseand (2) conditions of imprisonment.   The, considerationsplaced before me by my department an these questions areas follows:-(l) Release.      The prisoners were convicted not under  any emergencylaw but under the common law of this country.   They weresentenced by an ordinary court  (the Central Criminal Court)and their appeal against sentence was dismissed by  theCourt of Criminal Appeal.      Interference by the Executive with the  deliberatejudgment of the Courts is most &quot;undesirablej .   $accept in very special circumstances jThe position is not the  sameas in the case of offences  committed during   or  just afterthe war against emergency regulations.   There theExecutive had created a series of new and unusual offencesto meet the temporary emergencies of a wholly exceptionalsituation and it was right  and proper that it should exercise with unusual freedom the power of mitigating  the severity of the sentences passed for such offences.      While it is true that in  the past an amnesty  hasoften been  granted to prisoners convicted of  politicaloffences, this has only been done when the danger has passed over.   The principles that have guided british governments in the past were clearly enunciated byMr. Gladstone in defending  the  release of  the Irish treasonfelony convicts in 1870, as follows:- &quot;a political  crimewhen it has ceased to be dangerous, and when  suffering hasbeen undergone, should be treated with the utmost leniency.The danger  cannot be  said to have passed in the present case.      The unlawful organisation of the Irish  republican army in this  country  still  continues and it would be

It is pertinent in this connexion to observe that the recent release of  themilitary prisoner Dowling was made the occasion  of  specialcelebrations on the part of the Republicans in Ireland,&apos;  whohailed it quite unjustifiably as gratifying evidence oftheir power and influence.   And finally, in view ofrecent events in Ireland, it would seem particularlyundesirable at this moment that these prisoners  should beallowed to resume control of the rebel organisation inthis country.   Conditions of Imprisonment.  N   The claim made under this head is for &quot;political&apos;&apos;&apos;treatment, a vague phrase to which no precise meaning isattached in English law.   To this claim many of the considerations set out above in regard to release applygenerally though in a lesser degree.      The ordinary law (Prison Act, 1898) provides for atriple division of offenders according to the nature ofthe crime and the prisoner&apos;s antecedents, and the CentralCriminal Court, having regard to the prisoners&apos;  previousgood character, took advantage of this provision to place them in the Second Division in which prisoners of goodantecedents are specially kept from association  withprisoners of the &quot;criminal classes&quot;.      Section 40 of the Prison Act, 1877, as amended bythe Prison Act, 1898, provides that any person convicted of &quot;sedition or seditious libel&quot; shall be placed in theFirst Division.   These prisoners were however not con-victed of either of these offences but of &quot;seditious

This decision of law correspondo also to the merits of the case.   The special treatment accorded by the prison Act 1877 to persons convicted of sedition orseditious libel was no doubt designed for the benefit ofpersons who wrote or spoke words that were seditious.But seditious conspiracy goes beyond the words of an individual, and in particular this conspiracy extended tothe active assistance of the rebels in the field inIreland, the setting up of a rebel military organisation in this country and the institution (frustrated by thedeportations) of a campaign of violence in this country.In their judgment refusing 0&apos;Brien and rlcGrath&apos;^ applica-tion for leave to appeal, the Court of- Criminal Appealsaid that &quot;It was impossible to distinguish the crime ofwhich the prisoners had been convicted from high treason.They had been convicted of conspiracy to overthrow theinfant Irish Free State by murder, assassination, bombings,burnings, and open acts of violence of every kind.&quot;      It is argued that political treatment should begranted to these prisoners because in the past specialtreat ment. has from time to time been granted to Irishand other  &quot;political&quot; prisoners both in Ireland and inthis country.   But the circumstances are now whollydifferent  from those which led to such special treatment in the past both because the  conditions of prison lifefrom a health and  a disciplinary point of view have been
K9laxation,[any,buld be! transferI First[dsion.greatly ameliorated and because the system of classifica-tion set up. by the Prison Act of 1898 now provides for the due segregation from the ordinary prison population ofpersons who are not of criminal antecedents.      If any relaxation of the conditions of confinementof any of the prisoners is to be made, it is important that it should be of a kind which is provided.for by the prison Acts and the Statutory Rules made thereunder, i.e.by transference to the First Division.   The creation ofspecial conditions for any particular type of prisonershas been found by experience to be attended by undesirableconsequences.   In the words of the Royal Commission of1879 &quot;the grant of exceptional indulgence tends to disturbthe minds of the other prisoners and to interfere withthe orderly administration of the prison.&quot;                    * * -x- ft      The question is one of considerable importance andfor this reason and because of the close interest takenin these prisoners by the Labour party, I have thought it right to ascertain the views of my colleagues before coming to a deoision on the applications now before me. te on political&apos;Jfences  general.      I would add that a claim to recognition as &quot;political&quot;offenders is not limited to the Irish prisoners and thatthe present claim must be considered in relation to the wider question of the treatment of &quot;political&quot; offendersgenerally.      Hy advisers urge strongly that the setting up ofa special category of &quot;political&quot; offenders is open tograve objection.   As a category it is difficult to defineand extends, with every gradation, from the passiveresister to the &quot;political&quot;  murderer:   while it is hard to see how it would be possible to defend the selectionfor special treatment of this category or a part of it,
HOJIE OFFICE,     2?th March,  1924.frora the considerable number of other prisoners whoseoffences have been committed, or are claimed to have been committed,  from conscientious motives,  or at:any rate implyno moral turpitude.      The existing statute (Prison Act, 1898) gives theCourts a power, which there is no reason to think they failin proper cases to exercise,  to order prisoners to be placed.in the First or Second Division, whenever, having regard tothe nature  of the crime and the character of the prisoner theythink it desirable to do so:   and, while it may be proper forthe Executive to intervene for the purpose of mitigating the penalty on consideration of the merits of a particular case,any general interference on the ground that a crime wasprompted by a &quot;political&quot; motive could not be justified.
