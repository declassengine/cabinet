Agricultural Wages (Regulation) Bill.jfyiorandum by the Minister ofiAgriculture,, and F^horiee.     1*    I  circulate herewith the- draft  of  a  Bill  for the regulation of agricultural wages.          The Parliamentary  draftsman will finally  settle  the drafting  when the  proposals  embodied  in the  accompanying draft havebeen approved by the Committee and the Cabinet.     2,    The Bill provides  for  the establishment of  county committees composed solely of representatives  in equal numbers ofEmployers and Workers and of a Central Board composed ofrepresentatives,in equal numbers of Employers  and Workers, togetherwith a limited number of Members appointed by  the Minister ofAgriculture,          The County Committees  are to be given the power  to fixminimum rates of wages  for their areas subject to the proviso thatin the event of their failing to reach agreement within two months the matter shall be referred to  the Central  Board who will thereuponfix rates for a period  of six or twelve months,  at  the expiration ofwhich period the Local  Committee will again  be given  an opportunityto arrive at an agreement.          This method is proposed  in  order to  meet  the serious objection which is taken by  farmers to local rates  of wages beingfixed by  persons who are not regarded as  possessing the necessaryknowledge of local conditions.   At the same  time It providesmachinery for the  fixing of  rates  in  the  event Of the local Committeesfailing to exercise  their functions.          Rates fixed by Local  Committees are  subject to confirmation by the  Central  Board, and the Central Board  may itself fix a Rate
if it feels unable  to confirm the  rate  proposed by  the localCommittee..     5,   The essential difference between the  present bill and the Agricultural Wages Board  system of the  Com production act of 1917 lies in the power given, to  local Committees  tosettle wages for their respective  areas,  subject to confirmationor revision by the  Central Board,   Under  the Corn production act,  the local Committees  or District Boards had advisoryfunctions only as regards  rates of wages,  the duty  of settlinglocal rates being vested in the Agricultural Wages  Hoard.     40   The present Bill also differs in principle from theTrade Boards Acts in that  the Minister  of  Agriculture is notrequired to confirm the decisions  of the  Central Board.  In thisrespect  it  resembles the Corn Production Act which  left  the wholeduty of  settling wages to  the Agricultural Wages Board,  althoughunder that  Act the  Minister had power to direct the agricultural wages Board to reconsider  a decision.     5,   A question which has been left  open is the provision ofa Statutory Minimum Wage,         The basis on which minimum rates shall be fixed is laid down in Clause 2 (7)  of the Bill as  follows:-    &quot;In fixing minimum rates the  Committees shall secure for     able-bodied men such  wages (not being at a rate of  less     than thirty shillings per week) as will, in the opinion     of the Committee, be  adequate to promote efficiency and     to  enable a man in an ordinary case  to maintain himself     and his family in accordance  with  such standard of     comfort as may be reasonable  in relation to the nature of     his occupation&quot; a          I am at present  being strongly  pressed by the  &quot;nationalUnion of Agricultural Workers to  include  a 30/- minimum  wagein the Bill, and I  should like to  submit the matter to mycolleagues  with a view to  a recommendation being made to the
        A statement  is  attached setting  out  as  briefly aspossible the  arguments  both for and  against  the insertion of a Statutory Minimum,     60   The  point  is largely one  cf political  expediency,cut on balance I incline to the view that  it will  be  better to decide against  a  definite Statutory Minimum. The  workers are by no means united  on the point,  and to  include a fixed Minimum Wage will greatly intensify  opposition  and seriously jeopardise the prospects  of passing the  Bill thisSess ion.     7.   It  is not  possible at  the  present stage to forecastwith any accuracy  the cost of administering  the scheme.It will largely depend  on the number of  meetings which local Committees and the Central Board find  it  necessary tohold, and on the extent to which the provisions of theOrders are enforced by  or on behalf  of the Ministry.    Theexpenses of  the old Agricultural Wages Board in 1920-21were  57,000 and the expenses of the present system mightapproach that figure though probably not in  the first years                                    N.

            Agricultural Wages  (Regulation)  Bill.Arguments for and against the  inclusion of  a Statutory              Minimum Wage of  30/- per  week.                 General Considerations.             For a statutory minimum wage.1,  That it  is only by this means  that  the  present  low wages paid in certain areas can quickly be  raised to asubsistence  level.2.  That the pay of agricultural workers  is  dependent on local custom and not on any economic principle,  and that state action is necessary to break this  down.3.  That agriculture is the lowest paid of  all industries and that a statutory minimum will  tend  to keep up wagesgenerally.4,  That 30/- per week is no more  than  is demanded  by theincreased cost of living as compared with pre-war rates.5.  Against  a statutory minimum wage.          That 50/- per ?reek is more than many farmers can afford to pay at present prices and with their present methodsof farming.6.  That a number of farmers,  particularly  in the eastern counties would reduce arable cultivation, and discharge  somemen.  Generally farmers would  try  to avoid  an increase intheir total wages bill, so that with a  higher individualwage fewer persons would be employed.   (The number of mendischarged or getting only casual  employment is estimatedat 20,000, but this is only a  guess).
7.   That the Corn Production Act 1917 provided a statutoryminimum  wage of 25/- per week accompanied by guaranteed prices for wheat and oats which were very similar tothose now prevailing.          It will be said therefore that without theguarantee provided by the 1917 Act farmers are being requiredto pay 30/- per week instead of 25/-.8.   That the future trend of prices or of the cost ofliving cannot be predicted and that it is unreasonable for parliament to fix a statutory minimum which cannot be varied to meet current conditions.9.   That the general unwillingness of farmors to accept any wage fixing machinery will be greatly intensified by theprovision of a statutory minimum, and that the proposal willmeet with determined resistance.             Parliamentary considerations       In favour of a statutory minimum wage.10.  That a minimum of 30/- per week was  promised by thelate Government and that a Labour Government cannot adopt asystem which even temporarily will admit  of less being paid.11-  That during the Election many pledges have been givenin favour of a statutory minimum wage of  30/-  per week.12.  That in effect the inclusion  of 3o/- in  this bill is equivalent to establishing a national  MinimumV&apos;age.13.  That a large number of Agricultural workers willbe disappointed and dissatisfied if 30/-  is not provided *as a minimum.
                                                             i 114.   That if no minimum wage la inserted, the Liberalswill probably propose it and secure a tactical advantage,15.   That the insertion of the figure of 30/- per weekgreatly strengthens the definition clause relating to aminimum wage.             Against a statutory minimum,.16.   That the insertion of any definite figure isdifficult to defend.   Alternative figures such as 35/- will nodoubt be proposed in Parliament, and it will be difficult forthe Government to assert that 30/- represents a full livingwage,   It is more easy to maintain the principle of settle-ment of wages by the industry.   This is the main feature of allWhitley Councils and Trade Boards and if a minimum Is omittedthis Bill will follow well established precedent.17.   That an appreciable number of workers, including workersin Scotland, who are getting 30/- a week or more, w ill feel their prospects injured by the declaration of a 30/- minimum,IS,   That the inclusion of a statutory minimum will make thepassage of the Bill through the House of Commons troublesomeand nearly impracticable as -regards the Lords, with the resultthat it &quot;may be impossible to get the measure through thi3Session,   The prospect of repeal by any future Governmentwould be greatly increased.19.   A wage of 30/- per week will raise the question of thenumber of hours to be worked and will.- give unlimited scope for debate.nistry of Agriculture and Fisheries,

(1) Agricultural wages committees shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, fix minimum rates of wages for workers employed in agriculture for time work, and may also,  if and  so  far as they think it necessary  or expedient,  fix  minimum rates of  wages for workers 5 employed in agriculture for piece work.      (2) Any such minimum rates  may be fixed by  a committee  so as  to  apply : universally to  all workers employed in agriculture in the county for  which the committee  acts, or to any  special class of workers  so 10 employed, or to any special area of the county, or to any special class in a special area, subject in each case to any exceptions  which may be made by the committee for employment of any special character, and so  as to vary according as the employment is for a day, week, month,  15 or other  period,  or according to the number of working hours, or the conditions of the  employment, or so as  to provide for a differential rate in the case of overtime.     (3) If  a committee  are satisfied that  anjr  worker employed or  desiring  to  be  employed on time  work to  20 which a minimum rate fixed by the committee is applicable is so affected by any physical injury or mental deficiency, or any infirmity due to age or to any other cause that he is incapable of earning that minimum rate, the committee. may grant to the worker, subject to  such conditions (if  25 any) as they may prescribe (including, if they think fit, a  condition as to the wages  to  be paid  to the worker), a  permit  exempting the employment of the worker from the provisions of this Act requiring wages to be paid at not less  than the minimum rate; and while the permit 30 is in force an employer shall not be liable to any penalty for paying wages to the worker at a rate less than the minimum rate so long as the conditions (if any) prescribed by the committee on the grant of the permit are complied with.                                                 35     (4) In fixing minimum rates a committee shall secure for able-bodied men such wages, being at a rate of not less than  thirty shillings a week, as in the opinion of the committee are adequate. to  promote  efficiency and  to enable a  man in an ordinary case to maintain himself 40 and his family in accordance with such standard of comfort as  may be  reasonable in relation to the nature of his occupation.
       (5)  A committee may,  if they think  it expedient,  A.D. 1924   cancel or vary any minimum rate fixed under  this Act,        and shall reconsider any minimum rate referred back to   them by the Agricultural Wages Board for reconsideration, 5 and give effect to any recommendations accompanying   the reference.       (6)  Before fixing, cancelling or varying any  minimum   rate of wages the committee shall give notice of the rate   which they propose to fix or of their proposal  to  cancel10 the rate or of the proposed variation in the rate  as the   case may be, and of the place where and the time within   which objections to the proposal may be lodged,  not being   less than fourteen days from the  date  of the notice, and   shall consider any objections to the proposal which may15 be lodged within  the time mentioned in the notice.

(1) Where a committee have fixed any minimum Gonfirma-   rate  of wages or have cancelled or varied any such rate, tion.0^   they shall  forthwith send in the -prescribed manner  to by toni-6   the Agricultural Wages Board notification  thereof, and mjttees.25 the  notification  shall include  a  statement   of any   objections  received by the committee with respect  to   the matter  and  such other particulars as may.be pre-   scribed.       (2)  The Agricultural Wages Board, on receipt of such30 notification, shall forthwith take the  matter into their   consideration  and  unless  they think it  necessary  to   refer the matter back  to the committee for reconsider a-   tion shall, within one month from  the date on  which   the notification has  been received, make an order con-35 firming  the rate or the cancellation or variation, as the   case&apos; may be, except  where in their opinion the special   circumstances of the case make it necessary.or  desirable   to postpone the making of the order for a further period.       (3)  The  Board shall, as soon  as may be after they40 have made an order under this section, send notification   thereof to the committee  concerned, and give  notice of   the making of the order and the  contents thereof.

(2) In any proceedings against a person under this   section it shall lie with that person to prove that he has   paid wages at not less than the minimum rate.wages inaccordance
     (3) In any proceedings against an employer under this section the court may, whether there is a conviction or not, order the employer to pay in addition to the fine, if any, such  sum as is found  by the court to represent the  difference between the amount which  ought at the 5 minimum rate  applicable to have been  paid to  the worker during the period of six  months  immediately preceding the date on which the information was laid or the complaint was served and the amount  actually paid to him during that period, but  the power to order the 10 payment of wages under this provision shall not  be in derogation of any right  to recover wages by any other proceedings.     (4) Where an employer  has been convicted under this  section for failing to  pay wages to any worker at not 15 less  than the  minimum rate applicable to  him,  then, if notice of intention so to do has been served with the summons, warrant, or complaint, evidence may be given of any failure on the part of the employer to pay wages to that worker at not  less  than the minimum  rate 20 apphcable  to  him at any time  during  the  eighteen months immediately preceding the  period of six months mentioned in the last preceding subsection,  and on proof of the failure  the court may order the employer to pay. such  sum as  is found by the  court  to  represent  the 25 difference  between the  amount which ought  to  have been paid to the worker by way of wages at the minimum rate  applicable during those eighteen months  and  the amount actually so paid.     (5) Where an  offence for  which an  employer is 30under this section liable to a fine has in fact been com-mitted by some agent of the employer or other person,that agent or other person shall be liable to  be proceeded against for the offence in the same manner  as if he were the  employer,  and  either together with,  or before or 35 after the conviction of, the employer, and shall be liable on conviction  to the same punishment as that to whichthe employer is liable.    (6) Where an employer  who  is  charged with an offence under  this  section proves to the  satisfaction of 40the court that he has used due diligence to  secure com- compliance  with  the provisions of this Act, and that the offence was in fact committed by his agent or some other person without his knowledge, consent, or connivance, he shall, in the  event  of the conviction of  that agent or 45
   other person for the offence, be exempt from any con- A   viction in respect of the offence.       (7) Where it appears to the Agricultural Wages Board   or to any officer appointed by the Minister under this 5 Act that a sum is  due from an employer to a worker  on   account of the payment of wages to him at less than the   minimum rate applicable, the Board  or (if he is autho-   rised on that behalf by  special or general directions  of   the Minister) the  officer  may institute on behalf of  or10 in the name of the worker civil proceedings before any   court of competent jurisdiction for the recovery of the   said  sum: Provided that in any  such civil proceedings   instituted by the Board or officer as aforesaid the court   shall, if  the  Board  or officer  is not   a  party to the15 proceedings, have  the same power to make an order   for the payment of costs  by the Board or officer as if the   Board or officer, were a party to the proceedings.       (8) Any agreement  for the  payment of wages  in   contravention of this section, or for abstaining to exercise20 any  right  of  enforcing the  payment  of wages  in   accordance with this section, shall be void.       8.
