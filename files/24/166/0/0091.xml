[C 7427/70/18]                     No. 1. Notes on Conversations held at Chequers on the Evening of May 2 and the Morning of     May 3 between M. Theunis, the Belgian Prime Minister, M. Hymans, the Belgian     Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Ramsay MacDonald and Sir Eyre Crowe.     THE conversations were of an entirely informal kind and ranged freely over a wide field, but, of course, the main subject always reverted to was that of a settlement of the reparations question on a basis of the report of the Experts&apos; Committee.  The questions of inter-Allied debts and of a possible readjustment of the proportional shares of the several Allies in the German reparation payments were not raised.   In the present  notes only the essential points discussed are brought out.     M. THEUNIS opened the discussion  by dwelling at length on  the  strength of the feeling  which  animated not only the Belgian Government, but the whole of the Belgian people, in favour of a final settlement ensuring real peace; It had been with reluctance that the Belgian Government had joined the Prench in the occupation of the Buhr.   M. Theunis begged pardon for harking back to an unpleasant  incident, which, however, was now completely  passed.  He  referred to the fact that when Mr. Bonar Law in January 1923 proposed his plan of  reparations at the Pans Con- ference, he had deeply wounded Belgian feelings by suggesting the renouncement of Belgium&apos;s  priority right to reparation payments.  It was largely  the impression created by this  inroad on what the Belgians regarded as a kind of palladium, that the Belgian Government had found herself forced to take the side of Prance.     SIR EYRE CROWE interrupted M. Theunis in  order to make a rectification. He said he was about to commit an indiscretion, but he was anxious to put an end to what had been  a gross misunderstanding.  He explained that  when Mr. Bonar Law had included in his scheme a partial renouncement  by Belgium of her  right of priority, he  had done so because he had been given to understand informally through an outside channel, on which he had reason to place reliance, that if such a  proposal were  made the  Belgian Government would no doubt have to enter a formal protest against it, but  that this would be nothing more than a formal protest, and that, in fact,  Belgium would not raise serious objections. Clearly, Mr. Bonar Law had been misinformed or misled.  The situation was not such as he had understood  it to be, but it was in relying upon this understanding that  he made his proposal.  Sir Eyre Crowe, however, reminded M. Theunis that  as soon as Mr. Bonar Law became aware, from Mi. Theunis&apos;s own words, that any such proposal would  be deeply resented in Belgium, he immediately, there and then, formally withdrew  it.  In these circum- stances/Sir Eyre Crowe pointed out that there could have been no question of Belgian public opinion having been excited to the extent of compelling Belgium to side with the French in the occupation of the ruhr.  Belgian public opinion never heard of the proposal until attained it had been*formally withdrawn.  Sir Eyre Crowe had, however, no desire to pursue the matter.  It had no longer a practical, but only  an  historic,. interest.    M.  THEUNIS replied that, whilst that was so, the proposal had an unsettling- effect upon them and made them suspicious, but quite agreed that the incident was closed.  He went on to explain that whilst M. Poincare had at various times  declared that the object  of  the Ruhr occupation  had been to  place in the hands of France &quot; productive pledges,&quot; which would be set up to ensure  payments by Germany of the reparations due, the Belgian Government had never had any illusion as to the occupa- tion affording direct means of encashing reparation payments.   They had alwayslooked upon  the occupation simply as a means of pressure on the German Government to make them willing to arrange for payments.  In their view this object had nowbeen attained, and they shared the  opinion which had been formally expressed by oneof the American experts that it was due to the pressure exercised by the occupationthat Germany had now submitted  to the necessity of making effective arrangementsfor payment. This being the case,  the Belgian Government whole-heartedly acceptedthe conclusions  of  the  experts that the administrative  authority of the GermanGovernment  must be completely restored.  This, however, did not necessarily includecomplete military evacuation,&apos;but  involved  only the  withdrawal of the--economic      2164  [11560]                                                  B
arrangements  hitherto  imposed  by France and Belgium  in  the Buhr.  Theedid  not  think M.  Poincare would agree  at  this stage to put an end to thomilitary  occupation  in its entirety,  nor  did  the  experts&apos;  report  lay  thisdown  as one  of  the conditions  of the scheme.   It was,  moreover, understoodthat Germany herself would not make determined opposition to a provisional con-tinuance of what the French term an invisible military occupation of the Ruhr.  Thiswas one of the points on which it would undoubtedly be necessary to meet the French.There were two other points to which M. Poincare attached supreme  importance.One was directly connected with this continuance of a skeleton military occupation.The French authorities were preoccupied with the possible danger of their forces inthe Ruhr being cut off or endangered by a recurrence of the opposition made by thelocal population, with or without the support of the German civil authorities, to theFrench troops.  To  avoid this danger it would be necessary, according to  french military advice, that some form of control over the railways serving the Ruhr should remain in the hands of the French, not in the sense that they would interfere with theordinary management and economic running of the railways, but merely in so far asthe French must  have some  security in their hands to provide against  possibleobstruction to the movements or revictualling of their troops.    SIR EYRE CROWE explained that there seemed now a reasonable prospect ofthis difficulty being overcome in a practical way.   The Reparation Commission hadalready appointed  a  committee which was, in consultation with  German experts,endeavouring to arrive at an  agreement concerning the general railway regime to beset up under  the  experts&apos;  scheme.  This  committee had  been  charged by  theReparation Commission with the duty of trying to arrive at some understanding onthe point which had excited French anxiety.   The question might, therefore, for themoment be allowed to stand over.    M. THEUNIS then referred to what he considered the third and most important of the demands on which M. Poincare would be likely to insist as a condition ofcarrying out the  experts&apos; scheme.  The  French Government were so convinced  ofGerman bad faith, they were so  reluctant  to  commit themselves definitely to  anarrangement which could in any way be upset by Germany&apos;s refusal to be bound by her obligations, that they considered it essential to provide at once for the contingency of the German Government refusing to  carry out their  part  of the scheme of the experts.  France was determined in such an event to enforce those obligations, and she desired to make sure beforehand of  the  active co-operation of her  Allies, andparticularly of Great Britain in this task. What M. Poincare desired was a definiteunderstanding that if Germany were found to be in  default, certain sanctions, defined in advance, would become automatically  operative.  He was convinced  that by thismeans, and by this means only, the German Government  would be persuaded of thenecessity of keeping faith.    M. Theunis  said he had pointed  out  that it would be impossible for any british Government to promise active support in any military measures for coercingGermany in such an eventuality.  M. Poincare had readily admitted that  insuperable difficulties would stand in the way of  any British Government binding itself  inadvance to send a military force over the Channel.  It did not, however^ appear tothe Belgian Government necessary that the sanctions contemplated should include thedespatch of a British military force.   There were other means of coercing Germany,and he had suggested to M. Poincare that it would be sufficient if England undertook to take measures of a naval and economic character, such as a blockade of german ports, the prohibition of  German imports into British territory, and other measuresof boycott directed against  German trade.   M.  poincare had agreed that  such measures would be valuable, and M. Theunis now expressed the hope that we mightbe willing to meet M. Poincare to  the extent of promising to take part  in sanctionsof this nature.    MR.  RAMSAY   MACDONALD explained  at some length  the  reasons  forwhich the British Government would not be able to associate themselves with such apolicy.  He referred to the statements on this point which he had already made inhis public speeches.  The policy of sanctions was not one with which British publicopinion  could  be  easily   reconciled.    Nor  could  it  be  carried  out.    Hereminded  M.  Theunis   of   the  strain imposed  upon  this  country by   theblockade  policy  followed by Great Britain  during  the war.   It  was  only because  the  whole of the  Allies  freely,  and  nearly all  the neutrals more  orless under indirect compulsion, co-operated, that it became  possible to carry out the
arrangements:  hitherto  imposed by  France  and  Belgium in  the  Ruhr.  . Thevdid  not  think M. Poincare  would agree  at this stage to put an end to thtvmilitary  occupation  in  its  entirety,  nor  did  the experts&apos;   report  lay thisdown  as one  of  the  conditions of  the scheme.

M. poincare  had.  agreed  that  such measures would be valuable, and M. Theunis now expressed the hope that we mightbe willing to meet M.

RAMSAY   MACDONALD   explained at some length the reasons  forwhich the British Government would not  be able to associate themselves with such apolicy.  He referred to the statements on this point which he had already made inhis public speeches.  The policy of sanctions was not one with which British publicopinion  could  be  easily  reconciled.   Nor   could  it   be  carried  out.    Hereminded  M.  Theunis  of the  strain imposed  upon  this  country by  theblockade  policy  followed  by  Great Britain  during the war.   It  was  only because  the  whole  of the  Allies  freely,  and  nearly all  the  neutrals more  orless under indirect compulsion,  co-operated, that it became possible to  carry out the
  policy of blockade.  Such conditions could not be reconstituted to-day, and the result  of embarking on such a policy under  present  conditions would be to inflict vital  injury  on the trade,  industry and  prosperity of the British Empire,  whereas.  Germany would, with the help of the neutrals, probably suffer much less, and all the  benefits would really go to  the neutrals  themselves.      M. THEUNIS remarked that, after all, this policy of commercial pressure was  actually contemplated in article 16 of the covenant.      MR. RAMSAY MACDONALD reminded M.  Theunis of the difficulties which  had  arisen within the League itself in regard to this very subject, it being generally  admitted  that  almost  insurmountable  obstacles stood  in  the way of the  general  severance of trade and financial connections and  the consequential measures provided  for in article 16 of the covenant.   Such an agreement would require the  signature  of neutrals as well  as of  Allies.  Would America  agree?   Would  Holland,  Denmark, Switzerland, Russia,  &amp;c. ? Would they sign ?  He could not guarantee the  support of the Dominions.   They would have to decide for themselves; he could  not  commit them.   In any case, he could not make it clear enough that it was out of  the  question for any British  Government  to  pledge  itself  to  such a  policy as a  system  of  prearranged  sanctions  for  a  possible default of  Germany under  the  experts&apos;  scheme.    The  objection  was all the  stronger  if the  intention  was  that  it should again be  left to the Reparation Commission to decide by a majority  report whether, at  a given moment, there had been wilful default on the part of  Germany.  Such a position Great Britain could never accept.     M. THEUNIS  said that no doubt it would be desirable to arrange that for this  purpose the decision of the Reparation  Commission must be a unanimous one.     MR. RAMSAY MACDONALD replied that he could not see either the necessity of the practicability of any arrangement providing for the automatic application of specified measures of coercion on the occurrence, possibly many years hence, of events the exact  significance of which could hardly be measured, and still less effectively countered, so long in advance.    He certainly could  not allow France to assume that-  Great Britain would  act  against,  her own convictions  on the decision of a majority of her Allies.  Nor would  it promote the  spirit of ready  co-operation with which it was hoped that Germany would enter into the new arrangement, if, at the very outset, threats were uttered as-to what would take place if she failed.     M.  THEUNIS  said  that on one point he had anticipated our objections.  He had pointed out to M. Poincare that the word &quot; sanctions &quot; was very unpopular in this country, and its use should  be avoided.  M. Poincare had agreed, and said that he would substitute  the word &quot;  guarantees.&quot;  What he desired, then, were effective guarantees affording him as good security for payment as he now held in his hands in the Ruhr.    MR.  RAMSAY MACDONALD said  he would be  quite  ready  to speak  of guarantees rather than of sanctions, but then he desired to lay stress on the fact that very  strong guarantees, were already either  in the possession of, or offered to, the Allies.   There was  first  of all  the very substantial  guarantee in the Treaty  of Versailles.  Under  article  428  the west  bank  of  the Rhine, together with the bridge-heads, was  occupied  by the Allies &quot; as a guarantee for the execution  of the present treaty by Germany.&quot;&apos; It seemed to be constantly forgotten in  France that this  guarantee  existed  and  was in operation.   It was  one of the  most strict guarantees that any Treaty of Peace ever imposed, and if M. Poincare really thought that there  was no&apos; inducement for Germany  to comply with her treaty obligations, he apparently  altogether overlooked the passionate desire which every patriotic German must&quot; feel to see the  Rhineland liberated from foreign occupation.  Further-more, a very strong guarantee for German.y&apos;s meeting her obligations was afforded bythe scheme of control proposed by the experts making it more and more to GermanyVinterest  to accept  it  and  execute  it loyally.   The  scheme  contemplated i  anumber of specific guarantees placed in  the  hands of the  Allies in  connectionwith  the  constitution  of  the  bank,  the  control  of  the  railway  administra-tion, the pledging of revenues, industrial mortgages, &amp;c.  M. Poincare might justlyargue that in return for  giving up his &quot; productive pledges &quot;  in the Ruhr he mustreceive  equivalent  guarantees in other forms, but according  to the views of theBritish Government these guarantees were in fact being offered, and were far more substantial and real  than the proposals  just examined.  Mr.  Ramsay MacDonald.      [11560]                                                       B 2
would, however, consider whether they might be still further reinforced by bringing in the League of Nations in one form or another.  Indeed he would be glad to bring in the moral authority of the League, which should not be undervalued.    M.-THEUNIS&apos;, expressing some disappointment at the declared impossibility of meeting M. Poincare on this point of guarantees, repeated that it was essential toproduce something-to save the latter &apos;s face, and to satisfy his lawyer&apos;s predelictionsfor set plans drawn up in precise and legal wording.  He still hoped that it mightbe possible to give an assurance of such support as Great Britain might see her wayto promise in case of Germany&apos;s default.    MR.  RAMSAY  MACDONALD  said  his objections were  not  to  givingM. Poincare  guarantees, but  to cheating  him by offering  him  worthless ones.Schemes  could  not be made like automatic chocolate machines which delivered thegoods when anyone put a penny into the  slot.   He urged the  tremendous practicalvalue of the British  Governments making a  declaration that if  Germany, aftervoluntarily  coming into the new arrangement,  wilfully failed  to carry out  her obligations under it,  this would immediately and automatically bring together theAllies to take effective common action in defence of the agreement, and that  in such circumstances the British Government would at once consult with their allies as to themeasures  called for.   He  felt  convinced that such a  declaration would act asa  most  potent  deterrent  to  Germany, and  would  do  more  than  anything else to make her realise that her default would  bring the gravest consequences uponherself.  He could hold out no hope of going beyond this.   There were two  reasons which alone sufficed to prevent the Government from gping further.  One was thatany commitment necessarily involving measures of active  British intervention inpursuance  of  such a declaration would  have  no force without  the  sanction ofParliament.   The  action   of  future Parliaments could  not be foreseen,  andit would  never  do  for   the  British   Government   to  give  a  pledge whichit did  not  feel  certain   it  could  redeem.    It was  fairly certain  that  thepresent Parliament   would not  for  a moment  listen  to the extensive  pledgesdemanded by M. Podncare.   Possibly future Parliaments might take a different view,but it would be useless  to speculate on this.  The second objection, equally strong.was that for so important a policy it would be necessary to obtain the previous consentof the Dominions.  He believed that to be quite  impossible.    Now he wished to put to the Belgian Ministers the question what would happen if, owing to the unreasonable attitude of M. Poincare,  the plan of the  experts werenot put into operation and with it probably the last hope of a favourable and  definitesettlement of the reparations question disappeared.    M. THEUNIS  interjected that in such a case M. Poincare claimed fullestliberty for France to take any action she thought proper to enforce her treaty rights.    MR. RAMSAY MACDONALD said  he  quite  understood  this.  So would theother Allies have the  right to take what course appeared to them right.  For GreatBritain,  it would become necessary in that case to begin by challenging the wholelegality of the Ruhr operation, of the railway regie, of the M.I.C.U.M. arrangements,&amp;c. It would be a most deplorable situation. It was the last thing that  he desired todo, because it  could lead to nothing  but  a continuance, if not aggravation of thechaotic situation in  Europe.  It would also be certain to increase enormously thedanger of a  close rapprochement between  Germany and Russia.   The  Frenchsaid they were very nervous, and, perhaps, rightly  so, as to the danger threateningthem from  a-  thoroughly recovered and strengthened Germany with a populationtwice the size  of the French.    That danger no doubt existed.   With the  help ofRussian  man-power,. Russian resources,  and  other forms  of assistance,  germany would become so powerful that whatever  precautions France might take, there  wasthe risk of a great catastrophe.   Counteracting  alliances would inevitably be formed,and all prospects of an enduring peace would go.  It was therefore clearly the supremeinterest of the  Allies  at present  not to lose the  chance of settlement offered.  It  was:to be hoped that, in spite of the ominous signs of the German elections, the^ elementsstanding for peace in Germany might gain strength.  It ought to be the policy of theAllies indirectly to assist such a movmeent.   Opposition  to  the renewal of war  was strong in many quarters of Germany as it  was in other countries.  Everything oughtto be done to encourage the growth of that  feeling.  -  At M. THEUNIS&apos;S suggestion, MR. RAMSAY MACDONALD finally agreed toendeavour to prepare a declaration or formula setting out the real guarantees which.
France would obtain under the new arrangements which would be additional to those already provided in the Treaty of Versailles, and might be yet further enlarged by introducing the League of Nations.   If the terms of the document so  preparedshould meet with the approval not only  of  Belgium and Italy but also of France,he  gathered  from  what  M.  Theunis had  said that we  might  hope  to arriveat  an understanding all round.   He  pointed  out,  however,  that there were certain  other   things  yet to be done.  It  was  true that  the  several  parties,France, Italy, Belgium, Great Britain, and Germany  herself, had, in communicationsaddressed to the Reparation  Commission, accepted  the experts&apos;  report as  a whole;but as many portions  of the experts&apos; scheme went altogether beyond the obligationsimposed upon  Germany by the Treaty of  Versailles, it  would be  necessary, in orderto put the whole thing on a  proper basis, to have  an  agreement signed by all  theparties for giving effect to the experts&apos; scheme.   It need not necessarily be a longdocument, and  it would probably be preferable not to call it a treaty,  but to give itas informal an appearance as possible.   It might be called an agreement,  arrange-ment, or protocol.  In it provision  should  be made for bringing the scheme intooperation, one  of the essential points  being not  to lose time.    Means should  be devised for hurrying on the actual application of the scheme.  But as it did not come within the accepted obligations of Versailles, it could not be imposed.    M. THEUNIS suggested that it might be left to  the Reparation Commissionto determine the date on which  the German Government had passed  the necessary legislation, made the  required  appointments and  taken  the other steps  contem-plated under the scheme,  and that then  it should come into operation.    MIR.   RAMSAY  MACDQNALD pointd out  that it was not sufficient thatGermany  should make all arrangements.   It was also necessary that the  arrange-ments which must be made on the other side, especially as regards  the economicevacuation of the Ruhr and the withdrawal  of various  measures  connected with  the franco-Belgian policy  of productive  pledges,  should  be put   into execution.No loans  could  be  got without   that.  He would  like  to apply  a machinerymuch  favoured  in  English   legislation.   It  was   customary  in  our  Actsto arrange for an &quot; appointed day &quot; on which, automatically, certain things would happen.   If we could find a  means of fixing on an &quot; appointed day,&quot; it might  be understood that on that  day simultaneously all  the  German measures under  thescheme would enter into force, the schemes of control, and the withdrawal of Franceand Belgium from the Ruhr and the annulment  of the various coercive measures taken under decree by the Rhineland High Commission  would take place.    M. THEUNIS thought that this might  be a very suitable arrangement, but  hewas afraid that it involved a kind  of negotiation  with the German Government.To this M. Poincare would certainly be absolutely opposed; for he stuck to the idea that all that was required was for the Allies  to agree among themselves what shouldbe done and then to  present it to  the Germans  for their acceptance, leaving  all arrangements to be made by the Reparation  Commission.    MR.  RAMSAY MACDONALD  observed that  this procedure was really notpossible,  and he e&amp;mestly trusted  that it would not be pressed.  We had  sufferedenough in the  past from  what might be called the policy of  ultimatums, but what-ever justification there might have been for such a policy  so long as it was merely aquestion of enforcing  the observance of the clauses of the Treaty of Peace, we were now dealing with a  situation in  which Germany  was asked  to  undertake freshobligations, going far beyond anything she  was bound to do under the Treaty  ofVersailles. Since, however, it was admitted that  the scheme, as a whole, was very favourable to German interests, and since Germany  had in general  agreed to accept it, therewas really no reason to apprehend  any difficulties other than those whichnecessarily had to  be met in any negotiations, even among Allies, in arriving at anagreement for  giving effect to it.  In any case, it  could not be simply left to theReparation Commission to take all necessary  steps, since considerable portions of the experts&apos; scheme related to measures lying altogether outside the functions legallyexercisable by  the commission.    If, however, it were once admitted that the proper procedure was to negotiate anagreement with Germany which would  settle the manner of giving  effect to thescheme recommended by the experts, it might well be arranged that the conduct  ofsuch negotiation-so  far as they had to deal with matters outside the Treaty  ofVersailles-should on the part  of the Allies be  extended not to the Reparation
Commission as such, but to the individual members of that commission in the capacityof representatives of their respective Governments.    The question was then approached of  what should be the further steps to betaken in order to come to an understanding with France  in the whole matter.  Itwas agreed that it was undesirable to  move before the date of the French elections.On the other hand, it seemed important that M. Poincare should not in the interval,by further speeches and pronouncements, commit himself yet again on various points which it would be afterwards found the Allies could not meet.    MR. RAMSAY MACDONALD  suggested that the Belgian Ministers would do a service to the  Allied cause if they  could find an opportunity  of  impressing onM.  Poincare without  delay  the necessity of refraining from making any furtherspeeches or declarations in such a direction, and M. THEUNIS held out the hopethat he would find a means  of doing  so, either by going once more to Paris or bvcommunicating with M.  Poincare confidentially through the French Ambassador at brussels.    It was generally agreed that the  next  formal step ought to be a conference towhich it would probably be necessary to invite Italy as well as France.  But such aconference would lead to no  results  and would, therefore,  do  more harm than goodunless it were found possible previously to arrive at some general  understanding asto the basis on which agreement could  be reached.  -  MR. RAMSAY MACDONALD  finally  said he desired to raise a point of theutmost  practical  importance, but of a delicate character.  He trusted  the  Belgian.Ministers would  not misunderstand the nature of the observation he was about tomake; he had no  desire either to embarrass them or to suggest  that they should enterat this  stage into any definite commitment  which they might prefer  to avoid; buthe thought it only right to say that he  was somewhat apprehensive as to the outlookif,  when  the  conference  met, it should be found  that, as on previous occasions,Belgium,   whilst  expressing genuine  sympathy with the  British  position  andappreciation  of  British  difficulties,  felt herself,  for some  reason, compelled tocontinue her support of  M. Poincare&apos;s policy in opposition to Great Britain.  Weshould help each  other to an understanding untied to anything but what we  thoughtwise and practical.  A repetition of the dead-lock which would ensue could not becontemplated without dismay.    M.  HYMANS explained that  at  their recent meeting with M.  Poincare, theBelgian  Ministers had  carefully refrained from committing themselves  to  anyparticular line in regard to the matters on which they knew Great Britain andFrance to hold divergent views, and had deliberately restricted themselves to listeningto the views of the French Government.  If they wished to succeed in their mission of friendly mediation between their two Allies, it would  not do  for them now to depart  from their attitude  of  reserve and reappear in Paris bound by  definiteundertakings entered into towards Great Britain.  They must  keep their hands free.    M.  THEUNIS, confirming this view,  expressed the hope that  he  would not now be  pressed to declare himself definitely as to the precise line which  Belgiumwould ultimately take.   He felt confident that, by preserving  loyally  in the role ofmediators, the Belgian Ministers would render the best service to both sides.    SIR  EYRE  CROWE,  whilst  repudiating any intention to  exercise  pressure of any kind, asked M. Theunis to consider  hypothetically  what would  be likely tobe the effect on M Poincare if, contrary to what had been  the situation at previousconferences, he were to find himself face to face not with Great Britain in isolation,but with a combination of his three  Allies:  Belgium, Italy and Great Britain.In several instances recently,  M. Poincare, confronted by such united opposition, had given way, as in the case of the Crown Prince&apos;s return to Germany, and  the Separatistmovements in the Rhineland, and more particularly in the Palatinate.  Was it notto be expected that if he  found himself once  again isolated,  he  would see the  wisdom of bowing to  the moral  forces arrayed against him. -which would in this  case be reinforced by public opinion in the  United  States and many European countries-rather than take the responsibility of wrecking what was generally  felt to be thelast chance of effecting a definite settlement of the reparations problem ?
ri n    ME.  RAMSAY MACDONALD stated that it was not his intention to try andbind the Belgian Ministers, but he desired to point out the consequences if previouslypursued ways were still followed.    M. THETJNIS  admitted that in such circumstances, M. Poincare might considerit impossible to hold out for his extreme views and policy, but he still hoped this,in any event perilous, situation could yet  be avoided if free play were given to thespirit of conciliation all round.   As a first step, M.  Theunis now proposed to letM. Poincare know that before suggesting a date for the conference--which might,however,  be provisionally contemplated for the  end  of  this month Mr.  ramsay macdonald would  endeavour  to  put down in brief  outline what  might serve  assuch a basis.  It would consist of a rough draft of the proposed British declarationrespecting  guarantees and a skeleton programme of  the principal matters to  beagreed upon, especially as regards the convention, arrangement  or protocol to  be negotiated  with  Germany.   It was  thought possible that on  hearing of this,M. Poincare might  express the wish,  in anticipation of a conference, to come overto England  to have  a.n informal private talk with the British Prime Minister.   if so, Mr. Ramsay MacDonald said he would have no objection to meeting him, and theBelgian Ministers equally thought there might be  an advantage in this.                                                                  J.  R. M.    May 3,1924.&quot;Ji
