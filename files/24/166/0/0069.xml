(THIS DOCUHiLNT 13 THE PROP-STY Of HIS BRITAIINIC MAJE3T:/*3 SOVERUMENT)S 3 C B JECA BIKE TIRISH BOUHpARY .QU33TI0JJ,Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Home Affairs         and the Secretary of State for the Colonies.The Conference between representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Governments of the Irish Free State and northern Ireland, convened with the object of settling the boundary by agreement,  met on February 1st and adjourned next day on the understanding that it would meet again within 38 days. In the meantime Sir James Cr-aig fell serioxisly ill,  and his colleagues ashed for a  postponement of the Conference till the end  of April,  when it was hoped that Sir James would have returned  to duty. . The  Free State  Government  took the position that they could only agree to the  postponement on condition thatthe Boundary Commission  was constituted forthwith in  terms of Article IE of  the Treaty.   This, as we pointed out,  would terminate tho  Conference  at once.   In the  end  we persuaded  the Free State Ministers to resume the Conference  on the 24th,  on tho  understanding that  His Majesty&apos;s Government  were prepared to exercise-  all   he powers  vested  in them by Article 12 of  the Treaty to  constitute the  Boundary  Commission on  any  day upon  which the  Free  State Ministers  might intimate  that,  in their view,  the Conference  has finally  failed.     As our  uolleagues  will have seen  from the Press,  the impossibility  of reaching a settlement by agreement  was recognised  by  the Conference  last  night.  lYe propose  therefore to take the  following steps to redeem  the pledge  in  view  of which  alone  the Free State Ministers agreed to resume  the Conference  on  the 24th.(1)   The  Secretary of State  for  Home Affairs will request
                                  .                         t.- y jthe Government of Northern  Ireland to appoint aCoiiimlssioner in terms of Article 13.    (3)  The Secretary of State for the Colonies willtake steps to find a suitable Chairman for the boundary commission.  .         The Law Officers have advised that the boundary commission will not be constituted in tsrms of Article 13of the Treaty until the Government of Northern Irelandhave appointed their representative.;   and if the governor of Northern Ireland reports formally that his ministers are not prepared to advise him as to the appointment of arepresentative, a difficult situation will arise whichmust be carefully explored in its constitutional aspects.       It is possible that amending legislation will inthese circumstances be required to enable the Commission tobe appointed.   We advise that the Parliamentary Draftsmancliyuld he instructed  to prepare a bill to meet such a contingency.                        (Intd.)   A.H.                        (  &quot; )   J.  E. T.April 34th 1924.
