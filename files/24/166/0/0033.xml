WeMrw and Air Force  (Annual) Bill. 1924.&apos;^^T^MK^^^^^dum by the Secretary of State for War.SECRET -.39f/a,N./3108        With my memorandum CP,201/24 of 25th March, I         circulated the Army aad Air Force (Annual) Bill, and informed         ray colleagues that there was nothing in it to which I noed         specially oall their attenticn.                 It will fee seen, however, from to-day&apos;s Order Paper         that four members of the Labour Party and one member of the         Liberal Party have put down Notices of amendment of the Bill         ori the sutjeot of the Death Penalty.   This is a controversial         issue which is bound to lead to eonsiderable debate in the         House,of commons, and also in the House of Lords, if any of         the amendments are made to stand part of the Eill.  Apart from         the delay a serious political situation might arise between         the two Houses,                  Time is, therefore, an  important faetor in the         question because, as my colleagues are aware, the Bill must         become law on 30th April.  It means that in fact it must be         paased before we rise for laster,                  I have held a meeting of the Army Council to-day;         in view of the shortness of the notioe it was obviously         impossible to discuss a question with so important a bearing         en discipline in all its details.                  The Military Members of the Army Council, with whom         the Service Members of the Air Council who were represented at         our meeting to-day desire to associate themselves, have asked         me to make their position quite clear,  I subjoin therefore         the terms of a statement made on their behalf by the Chief         of the General Staff :-This
      this is the gravest issue with which I have been confrontedsinoe I beoarae a Member of the Army Council.  I have thereforewritten down a few remarks which I wish to make,       I first heard of these proposals from the Adjutant-general in easual conversation on 27th March.  I first saw the official and secret Precis now before us at 10,45 am yesterday, 31st March,Today is 1st April,  and tomorrow,  I understand,  it is intended that these proposals shall be put  before the House of Commons.       We,  as the Army Council, are collectively and individuallyresponsible for the discipline of the Army, and I do not thinkit is fair that we should be rushed in this manner.   I mustdefinitely refuse to discuss proposals which contain suoh vitaland far reaching ohanges 4n tha Army Act without full time forconsideration.       If it is still the intention of the Ministerial Members ofthe Army Council to press this vital matter; or if it is theintention of the Cabinet to let the matter prooeed to a debate in the House of Commons, in spite  of my remarks, I can onlyrepeat what Lord Beatty aaid at the Committee ef Imperial Defenoe,namely &quot;We are the servants of the Government and must Obey theorders of that Government&quot;, but I  hope at least that we may relycn the Secretary of State to Bay that his Military Advisers arenot In agreement with the proposals before the House,   We must also ask the Secretary ef State to make our views eloar on thispoint to the Cabinet&quot;,        The Admiralty are also concerned lnasmueh.an tho royal marines when on shore are under the Army Aot.        There Is no intention of the Government moving anysubstantive amendments in the direction of abolishing or reducing                                                       the

Although I myself signed the Minority Report of theDarling Committee in 1919 on Military Courts Martial (Cmd,428),I should have teen quite willing to let the whole question standover for further and more deliberate consideration.         It is for decision what action the Government  willtake in guiding the House when oach amendment is moved, Lt,ColonelMeyler actually goes so far as to propose the abolition of the death penalty for all offences,  including sven murder.

                                                             m                                                         3. the range of the Death Penalty.  If it is not possible to persuade the House to accept a Committee of Investigation  into the whole subject which is really quite an academic question, as tho Death penalty is practically never inflicted in time of peace, and if the deaision as to the acceptance of the various amendments on this subjeot is left to the Free Vote of the House, it would be only fair and proper,  I think,  that the views  of myMilitary colleagues should be made public in the course of debate.         Although I myself slgnsd the Minority Report of theDarling Committee in 1919 on Military Courts Martial (Cmd,428), I should have been quite willing to let the whole question stand over for further and more deliberate consideration.         It is for decision what action the Government will take in guiding the House when each amendment is moved, LtDColonelMeyler actually goes so far as to propose the abolition of the death penalty for all offences, including even murder.                         (Intd.) S.V/,The War Offioe,1st April,1924.
